bodymods,3e4hor,bellytrixrealstrange,4,Tue Jul 21 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, my septum piercing was the quickest healing I've gotten (I've got twelve) at about around a month to heal. I didn't have any issues aside from the odd crusties getting in the hole."
bodymods,3e4hor,Fuzz_butt,2,Tue Jul 21 22:07:03 2015 UTC,"Not a single issue, and my body has rejected so many other piercings. The piercing itself was relatively painless too! Go for it!!!"
bodymods,3e4hor,dennystardust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, my septum was the quickest healed piercing ive ever had. I also have had rejections but had no problem with my septum. Make sure your piercer has done them before and has a good rep. Mine had done them before but he still placed it poorly. You want to make sure its done in the ""sweet spot"" in your nose. Good luck!"
bodymods,3e4hor,sheriffkarli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"My septum was the easiest piercing I've ever had. If you go to someone who knows what they're doing, and actually pierces your sweet spot, there will be next to no pain. It's also protected since its up in your nose, so the risk of bumping it is a lot less, but just be cautious of your nose for the first week or two. On my second day with it I woke up and went to rub my face like usual, forgetting I had a fresh piercing, and oh my god did it hurt.  As far as healing goes it was a breeze, and I had mine pierced at an 8g. I did sterile saline soaks 2 times a day for 2 weeks, than once a day for 1 weeks and that was that. I felt completely healed after 3 weeks. I'm sure it wasn't completely healed, but it sure felt like it. At two months I had my local piercer check it out and change my jewelry for me, and it was a piece of cake. I did my first stretch at 3 months from 8g to 6g and it wasn't the most pleasant expierence, but it wasn't bad either. For my 4g stretch I decided to use a single flare glass plug with a rounded end and it was so much better than the steel crescent I used for my 6g stretch.  I seriously regret how long I waited to have mine done. I had been wanting it for years but was worried what others would think, what it would look like with my face, etc. and I wish I had just gotten it done years ago."

bodymods,3e4hor,Blueberry49,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"My septum was also by far the easiest to deal with. Almost painless for the actual piercing, easy to maintain after the fact (make sure you clean it or it will smell), and even my first stretch (12 to 10) wasn't bad. Sadly my 10g retainer fell out so I'm back at 12 but that's beside the point. Do it! It's easy to hide when you need to and I think it looks good on almost anyone."
bodymods,3e4hor,sourgangbang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:45:41 2015 UTC,My septum was the only piercing to heal really fast. It stopped hurting after a few days and I left it alone for a few months before changing the jewelry. I haven't worn anything in it for years and it stays open.

Al was fine for the first couple of months, Had it for a it in for 3months and lumps strayed to form and grow around it, saw a professional (other than who did it) and they said the other piercer did it too far back and had pierced the cartilage. They took it out and it healed/closed over after a few weeks.  I'd like to get it pierced again properly. But that's my story."
bodymods,3e50aq,Warmnewbones,0,Wed Jul 22 00:25:03 2015 UTC,I had mine done by Steve Haworth while he was in Hawaii. He tends to travel around a lot and you might be able to catch him nearby.

bodymods,3e09x4,GHo5T17,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"Sterile Saline (wound wash) soaked foam (not cotton) Q-tips for cleaning instead of tissues etc. Once you get used to it and it's healed you can go back to blowing your nose and using tissues like before, you just kind of have to re-learn how to do it. I got mine pierced at an 8g early this year, and the retainer was really annoying during healing. Now I have stretched up to a 4g (5mm) and it's so much better/easier ever since I started wearing SF glass plugs 90% of the time."
bodymods,3e09x4,WhatevaWhatever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:57:13 2015 UTC,"I had to start taking allergy medicine when I got my septum pierced because my usual seasonal allergies were impossible to deal with when I had a fresh piercing. Second the Q-tip recommendations. I will also recommend flipping it down before you blow your nose once it's healed enough that you can easily do that. And using a sterile saline nose spray was very helpful for me, especially when the inside of my nose got irritated and dry from all the sneezing."

bodymods,3dorjt,v3xx,12,Sat Jul 18 02:42:15 2015 UTC,The reason why oil massages work is because it increases blood flow which promotes skin cell growth

bodymods,3dml50,caffeinat,6,Fri Jul 17 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"Ok while everyone is jumping on the anchor bandwagon, let's have a chat about surface bars. When done correctly, they will last longer than anchors; in some places, they can even last forever. Hips can have a good long life, but as a high movement/irritation area, they might not last indefinitely, but they will last a long time.  Surface piercings are not something that can be done by everyone. Ask to see healed pics of clients. Ask to see the jewellery, if they come at you with a curved bar, leave; proper surface bars have 90° angles, that's how they last.  Because of the larger size of the jewellery, they are a lot more stable and a lot more resistant to both migration and hetting ripped out than anchors. If you want hip piercings to last, they should be considered your top option."

It all depends on the individual but mine tend to get infected every so often and one looks a little closer to the surface so I'm sure it's rejecting. But that's to be expected kinda.. The only thing i can recommend is to TRY and make sure they dont get knocked around too often, trauma can increase the risk of rejection. Which is a littlehard because you never realize how much that area of your hips go through until you get it done, lol.  I've known people with microdermals though that have had theirs for 5+ years."

I'm a Canadian, so perhaps there are better international names in the industry, but Russ Foxx in my country is THE BEST to go to for ear-shaping, tongue-splitting, scarification, subdermal implants to make you look like you have whiskers or horns, etc.  He tours all around the country and will take appointments on a very casual basis. He was recently not too far from even my small, rural, Canadian farm town, so he's very accessible as far as bringing his services to anyone who wants them goes.  His prices aren't bad, either. I believe that the average ear shaping, before a tip, comes to a little over 500$"
bodymods,3daqrg,thenoorys,3,Wed Jul 15 01:28:22 2015 UTC,Russ Foxx is my artist! He did both my ears and my recent tongue split. He is super cool and easy-going and has an absolutely fantastic bedside manner. I thoroughly enjoy having him put sharp things in my body.

Ahhh, New Orleans to Canada would be a long way to travel. I live in Prince Edward Island, Canada, and Russ came to Moncton, New Brunswick just a few months ago, which is only about 1.5 hours away from me.   From what I know of Russ, he generally practices out of Victoria, BC and/or Vancouver. Great guy, loves what he does, EXTREMELY hygenic and professional, but doesn't take himself too seriously. When he's on the road, he's even been known to accept the occassional offer from a fan to crash at their apartment. I would be thrilled if Russ Foxx slept on my couch for a night.  I digress, 500$ is so do-able, and for beautiful ears like the ones attached to OP's head, I'd jump at the chance if only I wouldn't have to sacrifice my beloved ear cartiledge piercings.

Despite the painful pulsing sensation for the next few hours it was a great decision for me.  I'm just about 00g now and I couldn't imagine getting to this point having to stretch through the smaller sizes.  You want to take your time and stretch properly with healing time between each size. So getting pierced at a larger gauge gives a great head start!

I prefer the biopsy punch and new ""oneedles"" (biopsy punches made for piercing, so no medical license required for purchase) for cartilage piercing. needles tend to push the cartilage out of the way, leaving a ""flap"" of cartilage near the site. the punches and o needles cut a clean hole out of the body, so no pushed cartilage. they also make a clean incision, so healing time is great."

bodymods,3ctpcw,deepdarkocean,8,Fri Jul 10 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"My advice for any gun piercing is to let it heal and get them re-done by a professional with a needle. Be aware, though, that gun piercings nearly always leave behind a chunk of scar tissue due to the nature of how they make the hole to begin with, and it might be difficult to re-pierce in the exact same spot. Gun piercings are harder to get aligned and might end up healing all wonky if you let them stay in. Good luck!"
bodymods,3ctpcw,loveswell,2,Fri Jul 10 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"I would take it out and let it heal. Not only was it done with a gun, but the placement is poor and will most likely prolong healing. And there's no way there's proper jewelry in there."
bodymods,3ctpcw,S-E,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"That metal is not safe to be in your body. Take them out and let them heal ASAP. Guns are terrible for lobes, but should never be used in any cartilage piercing, even the manufactures say so. After 6+ months you can start to think about having them repierced, maybe a bit sooner if you're ok with the artist choosing a slightly different location for each piercing. When do you have them done correctly the artist may not even be able to pierce them exactly where they are now due to possible damage from the blunt force teams injury. When you do have them repierced, check out Safepiercing.org to see if there are any APP certified artists in your area. That way you'll at least know they'll be using implant grade jewelry that is much more biocompatible and that the shop is clean and follows today's health standards. Cartilage can be very finicky and hard to heal for some people even when done correctly, but when a gun is used the chance of having a healthy piercing is next to none. Before getting pierced make sure to do some research on who will be touching your body. Look at reviews and portfolios and talk to them and see if you click. Make sure to let them know that they have been pierced with a gun before, so they can examine your ear to make sure that it'll be safe to pierce. Cartilage collapse is not something to mess around with."

Today I went to a professional piercing & tattoo parlor and they examined my ear and told me that the piercings (surprisingly) were aligned with the ear and placed correctly. They said there seem to be no issues and no complications and that it is best to keep this jewelry in if i plan going on with the healing process. They recommended me to keep cleaning them as I am, and if any issue arrises to go there and they would remove them. So, after this information, i have decided to keep them, consider myself lucky and see how it goes Thank you ( I will update in a new post in a few months!)"
bodymods,3ctpcw,kaleighbear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"It's highly recommended to get them done with a needle. It heals better and is more precise.  Personally I have 3 on my left ear and 1 on the right. All done with a gun (I know, bad) and they healed just fine. No weird lumps like some people get. I heal well though. If you've ever had a problem with scarring or other piercings, I'd take them out and get them redone."
bodymods,3cvhul,soo_itt_goess,5,Sat Jul 11 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"Getting to that size could take up to 2 years depending on what size you are pierced, how well you look after them, and how well you heal.  They may shrink down, they may not. It also depends on the above conditions. The slower you go, the healthier you'll be generally, and the higher the odds of them shrinking later."
bodymods,3cvhul,CheezyMcWang,3,Sat Jul 11 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"It took me about 2.5 years to stretch from 18g. I've been hovering between 2g and 10mm for the last 2 years (my ears shrink and act up in the winter).  You should be stretching 1mm every 3-4 months (though depending on your ears you may need longer). Get some high quality glass, or implant grade titanium or surgical steel, and get vitamin e or jojoba oil to massage your lobes. Make sure not to rush it; don't skip sizes or stretch more than every 3-4 months. High quality jewelry is a beautiful thing, and your ears will thank you for it. Don't cheap out and get acrylic. And don't stretch with silicone either."
bodymods,3cvhul,shaza420,2,Sat Jul 11 06:45:13 2015 UTC,I went from no piercing to 1/2 inch in a little more than 6 months. When my piercings are out for a few hours they shrink considerably.   I stretched up two sizes every three weeks for the gauges up to 8 then one size every three weeks after. In some cases it took twice as long to heal. Soaking is highly recommended but for me personally it wasn't necessary. I'm super clean and hygienic as well a having a prodigious healing rate.

Mine shrunk very quickly... usually within a few hours I noticed a difference, and more than 24 hours I would lose a size. The shrinking did slow down quite a bit after the first week however. Because your piercing is new and small I would not risk 3 days. Maybe wear the 20g during the day and swap back to your 16g while you sleep?  One benefit of stretching to a bigger size is that when it shrinks you don't always have to have something in. I still wear various pieces from 16g to 10g when I feel like it but most the time it's empty."

bodymods,3chvew,practicaluser,11,Wed Jul 8 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"Long story short, black jewelry isn't a thing you want to roll with.  The only options worth considering are niobium which as you've guessed does often have a greyish tone to it, or glass. Companies for glass worth checking out are Gorilla Glass or Glasswear studios. Outside of those options, anything with the stark black you're looking for is plastic coated or painted and that shit is toxic. It's costume jewelry at best, but most of those plastics (if not all) breakdown once they've warmed up to body temperature and release all kinds of chemicals into your body."

bodymods,3chvew,poutinethrowawayx,2,Wed Jul 8 04:57:39 2015 UTC,"Nope? Anatometal is a quality jewelry company you could seek niobium from?

bodymods,3chvu3,malicesin,3,Wed Jul 8 01:05:32 2015 UTC,"military requires no visible light to show through your ears. they'll even pull them to see if light shows through. I'm not sure if they'll close that much in a short time period. use jojoba oil and massage to break away scar tissue, this will make them close faster.   if you don't want a hole then you might possible have to have a very small surgical closure. nothing big. just make sure to take them out and let them be out for a few months while doing the oil massages before resorting to that. they should return to a small size (initial piercing size) somewhere In that timeframe.  as well,  Oregon is a pretty liberal state, getting a regular job shouldn't be hard with tiny holes in your ears. they don't need to be fully closed."
bodymods,3chvu3,TreyN7,2,Wed Jul 8 02:08:25 2015 UTC,Maybe try preparation H. I've heard of people using it to help their lobes close up a little bit faster.
bodymods,3chvu3,hairyerectus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"Well no matter what they're not going to be closed tomorrow. How long have you had jewelry out for? 4g is only 5mm so they're not that large, and you should be able to close naturally. What you need to do is leave them out for a few months while doing massages and see where you get. I've never heard of a body mod artist or plastic surgeon doing a closer until you've had jewelry out for a few months anyway. Best of luck."
bodymods,3cfac2,thefinalep,9,Tue Jul 7 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"You had it pierced at that small size, knowing you would want to stretch it? Tsk tsk.   I'm tempted to tell you to get it repierced or punched at the size you want. Yeah you'd have to heal again, but septums are tricky to stretch anyways. The tissue isn't very elastic, and the piercings tend to butt up against your cartilage which can really make it painful, and effects how big you can stretch before it hurts too bad from being against your cartilage. Otherwise, just take your sweet time stretching. I would use a smooth curved retainer (u shape rather than π shape which has corners to get past on your way to the wearable area). Take your sweet time, and always wait several months between stretches."
bodymods,3cfac2,thrownormanaway,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:34:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Is there any good online sites that I can buy supplies at?
bodymods,3cfac2,thrownormanaway,6,Tue Jul 7 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"I like bodyartforms.com is great, but please support your local shop of at all possible, assuming they sell quality merch"
bodymods,3cfac2,Hippie_punk,3,Tue Jul 7 16:29:26 2015 UTC,Plenty of good advice here already but I would like to add that by using the ptfe/bondage tape method I was able to stretch full sizes rather than bothering with buying half sized jewelry which adds up over time. I started at a 14g and waited about six months for the first stretch. I used a taper for the small sizes because wrapping them is not really plausible. I used a bullet retainer from bodyartforms.com and waited about two months between each stretch. Then I would add a layer of tape every couple days until I hit the next size. I've been at a 2g for over a year now and with patience I never had trouble. Around 6g you may feel it beginning to dent your cartilage and it will be uncomfortable until your nose adjusts. Good luck.
bodymods,3cfac2,rpgoof,2,Tue Jul 7 21:19:54 2015 UTC,"Septum stretching is tricky. You may be able to start now, but you definitely don't want to skip sizes. Half sizes are recommended as well after 8g (7g and 5g specifically for you). Some stretch with tapers, some use pinchers. Whatever you're comfortable with. Just don't continue stretching if you feel pain. Septum stretching is likely going to be uncomfortable due to the nature of the septum flesh, but stretching too fast will harm the fistula and cause all sorts of problems. Its hard to say the timeline as everyone is different. Some can stretch once a month, while others have to wait three months or more. Just listen to your body and stay on the safe side and wait if you're unsure. I started at 12g and after waiting 8 months, have waited 2 months between each stretch. I've been using tapers and glass retainers and am currently at 8g. Its been nearly 3 months now and once I'm off vacation I'll be trying again to reach 7g with a titanium plug - hard to really find what you want in half sizes."
bodymods,3cfac2,TreyN7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"I'm at 00g with my septum right now. I personally would get it repierced at somewhere between 10-6g. it'll save you time and money ,cause at this point, to get to 10g it'll take you about nine months (three months a size)  septum stretching is harder and more of a pain than ear stretching. if you don't clean your septum daily you WILL get a smell. and there are a lot more nerves in your septum, so some pain can occur.  when you stretch your septum you may have sinus issues (sneezing and congestion) and the rare possibility of deviation. I know a guy who is at 1/2 inch and is getting surgery for septum deviation (which is painful and expensive)   my suggestion is to buy glass plugs from Glasswear studios. they're seriously about 8 dollars, they're very smooth and are inert, so there's no possibility of allergic reactions."
bodymods,3cdq8e,Azur3Blu,10,Tue Jul 7 02:53:53 2015 UTC,You don't want to hear this but take them out completely and wait a month. Whatever size they're at in a month start from there. And stop using tapers.
bodymods,3cdq8e,homesick66,4,Tue Jul 7 03:12:53 2015 UTC,I would rather not have a deformed ear so If it will prevent some of the ugliness then i'll do it. wait you don't use tapers when you are ready move from sizes...?
bodymods,3cdq8e,homesick66,4,Tue Jul 7 03:14:38 2015 UTC,"No I did but that was years ago before I knew better. My ears are currently 1 1/2"" after 7 frustrating years of effort. Tapers are great for inserting jewelry or... less risky at small sizes but you're getting larger and you really should consider the teflon tape method at this point. Also, by definition you are deforming your ear so there's really no way to predict exactly how it's going to look but if you want to avoid blowouts then losing the tapers will certainly help decrease that risk."
bodymods,3cdq8e,lixelpixel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:19:42 2015 UTC,Noted. I don't want to go any larger than 2g. I find cat butt the most unattractive result of bad habits I just hope I didn't destroy the potential of clean stretching result. I'll look up taping :) thanks you for your help and support
bodymods,3cdq8e,sailorgloom,0,Tue Jul 7 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Personally I've always used tapers to size up. I'm at 00g right now and staying this way. However, if your ears are going to react like that, then I suggest the taping method. Not everyone's ears are going to be the same, sometimes they need to go slowly."
bodymods,3cdq8e,WhatevaWhatever,3,Tue Jul 7 07:01:22 2015 UTC,The 'crust' is your ear trying to heal itself. Take everything out and let it heal. Don't over-clean it and don't scrape away the crusties. Don't use tapers anymore.
bodymods,3cdq8e,ilexvulpes,2,Tue Jul 7 05:50:55 2015 UTC,"If your ears were still that tight after months at 5mm you should look into 3g next time. The recess for the O ring to sit in should not cause your ear to tear by any means of you were ready to stretch. We're your 2g 6mm or 6.5mm? If your ears are seriously not elastic at all by now I'd highly recommend you doing half sizes. So after a month, or more, naked once you get back up to 5mm hit 5.5mm (3g) and than 6mm and finally 6.5mm if that's what you want your goal to be. I know Anatometal and IS both use 6.5 for their 2g so if that's the case than you most likely tore because your taper was 6mm and your jewelry was 6.5mm. Also, were you trying to put in single flare eyelets right from the jump? Because that's another no-no."

bodymods,3byc0q,TheEmpiresBeer,4,Fri Jul 3 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"You can buy quality septum jewelry from any reputable piercing shop. Most reputable jewelry companies won't sell directly to consumers. Try finding the closest APP certified shop to you ( http://www.safepiercing.org/locate-a-member/ ) and also search around sites like BVLA ( http://m.bodyvision.net ), Honeycomb organics, Tawapa (a quick google search should work) to get a feel for what your options are. You can achieve the layered septum look with a simple clicker with layered rings soldered together or by stacking a few rings (which would require stretching).  If you aren't near an APP shop try calling the closest one to you and seeing if they're willing to ship to you. Most APP members are very helpful and willing to get people the quality of jewelry you deserve.  Sites like etsy will sell a lot of similar styles but with that you never know the quality of the jewelry you're getting (well you sort of do - low) and also it's hard to acquire the right fit without some trial and error"

bodymods,3byzog,veggie151,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:21:49 2015 UTC,"Meh, I'd think having two on the sides could work. It really boils down to technique.   If you're a fan of swirly-er style tongue movements when going down on a dude then the double would probably be great. With anything center based, its mostly pushing along the urethra which is nice, bit not insane. You'll also have better control for getting your piercing on/in/around the frenulum which is the real selling point. The double losses a lot of this urethra pushing on exchange for a nice pressure on either side, which as a guy honestly sounds much better. For the frenulum, you'll lose a little control but should still be able to get the same effect using different motions.   Overall technique is key, and really no matter what you go with you'll do fine so pick the one you like. Try paying attention to your current tongue movement and style if you give a blowjob before you get the piercing."
bodymods,3byzog,veggie151,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:10:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a straight guy, so I don't plan on giving any blow jobs. I guess I probably should have specified that huh xD"

Liquid latex would work well for what you're considering doing. I worked at a costume shop, and we sold a lot of high-quality theatrical make-up. Liquid latex is so versatile, it's crazy.  I would recommend buying from either Ben Nye or Mehron's line of latex. They should have bottles as small as 1 oz in clear, fair, and tan. The smaller bottles will come with a nail polish style applicator that you can dab into your scars. (Less is definitely more with this kind of application.)  After drying for 3 - 5 minutes, any kind of make up can go right on top. Just make sure to set it with a powder.  Congratulations on your wedding - my husband and I got married less than three weeks ago! Best of luck with everything, and don't stress too much about a couple of scars."

You could try (if you haven't already) using a pore minimizing primer, like Benefit's POREfessional or something, to make it less noticeable.

There has been little scientific evidence to support these claims (source and source) If you're interested in actually reducing scar tissue and the appearance of scars, look into silicone occlusive therapy - its what they use on burn victims. Silicone is applied to the wound after it has stopped draining, usually as an adhesive patch, but sometimes as a gel on larger areas. I believe the consumer brand is called scar-away and is available on Amazon."

In retrospect kind of wish I would have gotten one in each ring finger instead of two on one hand. Steve put the first one in like butter but the second was painful. Even though some people like to go raw, you get a better install when you are numb since you're not squirming.   The only real down side so far is that certain power tools are a bit uncomfortable to use. I've got a powerful corded drill and when it gets up to speed it is somewhat unsettling. The only bad experience so far was coming across a hidden magnet by surprise and the implant got stuck mid flip. Otherwise I find the sensation of the magnets rotating almost pleasurable. Even if I had to have them taken out tomorrow I would still feel incredibly privileged to of had this sensory upgrade at least for a while."

I am so excited, only two weeks to go! I've got my Arnica Montana and H2Ocean ready to go. May I ask what regimen you used for the Arnica? I purchased the pellets and the gel. The email said to start a regimen at least a week prior and continue through two weeks after but looking at the dosage on the pellets that means I should start taking 15 pellets a day pretty soon, and that seems a little extreme.  Thank you for the informative reply!"

So, I got an RPA and put a bar through both holes. The RPA was more painful to heal, and to get pierced. This makes sense, when you take anatomy into account.   My wife has had opportunity to try many different configurations of my jewelry; she says she like the plain PA with a CBR,  because there is no ""rubbing"", and the ring flips around and drags back and forth while in use.

bodymods,3anhvi,Satanfister0218,3,Sun Jun 21 23:50:25 2015 UTC,The piercing is way too low and I cannot believe the piercer didn't let you know about the issue with the jewelry beforehand.  It will be adorable when you get it pierced higher.
bodymods,3anhvi,thiscoolnightair,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:11:52 2015 UTC,Shouldn't you have just gotten smaller diameter jewelry? The piercing is in a sweet spot for your nose so you can't control where it is somewhat. It looks like the diameter of jewelry you have is 10mm+ which can look ridiculous on anyone if the gauge is off. I myself have 8mm diameter jewelry and it's 10 gauge so it balances itself out. Don't know if you needed to follow the other redditors advice.

bodymods,3afx4w,sabrinariott,14,Fri Jun 19 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend soap. Salt water is great because it kills bacteria. Soap is a different ball game that is mainly for getting rid of oil. Using too much antibacterial will stop your body from healing the area naturally and can delay healing or to scarring.   I don't know what system you've been using so far but a cup of boiled water with sea salt added, wait until it cools a bit and tip the cup over your nipple and hold there, submerging the piercing for at least 10 mins definitely gets it cleaned and healing fast, the best way i have found. Sorry if i sound condescending, hope it gets better!"

bodymods,3afx4w,loooooooooordjezuz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"I second /u/welliesong, I would not recommend putting any type of soap on what is pretty much (no, exactly) a fresh, open(?) wound. Sea salt water mixture or sterile saline (available at wal-mart or similar types of stores) will be best for you :)   Also don't sweat the lake thing, I let someone put their mouth on my nipples a month after getting them. For the record, I did not get an infection from it, so maybe that will give you some peace of mind.   Another thing worth mentioning, I know a lot of people are adamant about ""OMG BLOOD IZ BAD GO TO UR PIERCER NOW U R GONNA HAVE TO GET YOUR BOOB AMPUTATED"" but let's be honest, you just got a needle put through your nipple. shit's gonna bleed.   maybe I rambled too much, maybe this helped.   EDIT: ibuprofen helps me with the tenderness/pain"
bodymods,3afx4w,vanisaac,3,Sat Jun 20 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"ibuprofen helps me with the tenderness/pain   Unfortunately, it is also a mild blood thinner, though much less so than aspirin, so if you are having issues with bleeding, it can be a bit counter-productive."

bodymods,3aebkj,Sapling666,2,Tue Jun 23 08:04:19 2015 UTC,"Got mine split almost exactly a year ago. I had stitches for five days and for the first 48 hours I stayed away from solid foods. Here are two tips that I think really helped me out...   I got a pretty intelligent tip from someone who's biomed and into mods and they suggested treating it like a procedure. She suggested that the week before you should focus on loading up on vitamins/minerals that helped with circulation, healing and clotting. (Basically things like iron, Vitamin E, biotin, omega acids, etc.) So I loaded up on foods like spinach, fish, broccoli, eggs, etc... I can't necessarily prove that it worked, but my healing period was actually pretty nice. I had some pain but it wasn't unbearable and my tongue healed up beautifully.  Workout your tongue while you're recovering. A common thing during the first few days is your tongue will try to heal itself back together since it's just sitting there in your mouth (since you're not eating or talking much) For the first two days, I had to literally pull the halves apart every hour or so. I'd always do my best to complete this motion just using the muscles in my tongue, not my hands. Even though it kinda hurt, I played with my tongues pretty often during those first few days and as such I've got a LOT of control now. I've heard people say that if you wait until it's healed to learn how to use it, you won't have as much control.    I also think the biggest thing about the two above tips was that I think it REALLY helped minimize my regrowth. I didn't really have any, just a little tiny bit of webbing at the base, and I'd like to think it was because I was super diligent at keeping the halves apart, working the muscles, and also giving my body the nutrients it needed to heal swiftly and safely. Like I said before, there's no guarantee that this stuff will work for you since everyone's body handles things differently, but it's worth a shot!!  Enjoy your new tongues! :B"

Do you have to lube for insertion? If so, what did you use?  Does the tape tend to dry out or get uncomfortable? What's your routine during stretching- SSS, LITHA, etc... and how often do you change the tape out? I saw that you would wait 4-6 days before upsizing."
bodymods,3a8k2u,vanisaac,3,Thu Jun 18 05:54:27 2015 UTC,"Do you have to lube for insertion? If so, what did you use?   Yes, emu oil. This was a little tricky because if if the tape gets too wet, it will work itself between layers, then the tape no longer sticks to itself. I thought working with gloves would make it easier since it's easier to grab lubed jewelry with gloves, but there's also some kind of powder on the gloves I have which also makes the bondage tape not stick to itself. The best method I found was to take clean jewelry and tape, wrap it perfectly, and then keep it pinched tight without gloves. Put just a small amount of oil on the end, then once it's in the piercing put more oil on the rest of it.   Does the tape tend to dry out or get uncomfortable?    Drying out was never an issue. Occasionally the end of the tape would get prickly -- think a tiny dull knife. Rotating the piercing ""the other way"" would fix that.   What's your routine during stretching- SSS, LITHA, etc... and how often do you change the tape out?    It was never really irritated or sore like a new piercing so I never soaked it, mostly just left it alone except for when showering because the tape starts to smell funky. I changed tape out every 4 days or so. I wasn't really sure how long to leave it before upgrading, but 4 days seems to work out pretty well for each size increase."

I wore sports bras a lot to keep them from catching on things, but if you just wore a tighter undershirt under a shirt and an undershirt to bed to cut down on friction, that would probably be enough.     As for cleaning, I did warm sea salt soaks twice a day for about 3-4 months, and then any time I felt they were particularly sore or crusty. Also a Q-Tip soaked in sterile saline to clean away crusties.   I babied my piercings for awhile, so I didn't allow any playing with them for about 5 months (and I would do sea salt soaks after). But use your judgement. If you can comfortable touch them and play with them gently, then they should be healing fine. I felt mine were sufficiently healed by the 1 year mark, because they were rarely sore, little to no crusties, and can now be played with with no discomfort.

Holy fuck, your first hair wash after getting your sutures out is going to feel like the best thing in your life. Had mine done going on 5 years and a bit by Efix Roy when he did a guest space in Melbourne Australia at The Piercing Urge.  Left and Right  These pics are about 5 months after getting them done.

bodymods,39mqtk,vivolleyball15,2,Fri Jun 12 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"Something like that image seems fine, but keep in mind that at a point it gets difficult to do a lot of detail. The design/placement is something you'll hash out with your artist once you've selected them and where you want it.   I don't know how to describe the pain as it's a unique sensation. Burning numbness? Your endorphins rush in pretty hard so I wouldn't be worried. You'll be tender afterwards so wear loose clothes and don't sleep on it. Generally speaking it hurts more when over an area close to the bone (collarbone, vertebra, etc) but everyone's different.   As for care, I've always done fine with: don't drink the night before, stay hydrated day of, have a big meal a little beforehand and then follow the instructions given to you for aftercare to the letter.   I was really neurotic before myself but it's really a breeze!"
bodymods,39mqtk,TASTY_TASTY_WAFFLES,6,Fri Jun 12 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"Your artist will probably have an opinion about the size and the location. Depending on their skill, they may just flat out say 1-2 inches is too small for your design in which case you'll have to decide what you're comfortable with.  For me, the worst part is the first minute or so, while you're body adjusts to the initial shock of it. While it never became ""painless"" for me, you do sort of get into a state where it becomes a good-hurt, like scratching an over-scratched itch or stretching a sore muscle. I honestly find it to be more sore the morning after.   I don't think there's a lot you can do before getting it other than not getting drunk (I always take a shot beforehand as tradition, but that's apparently a bad idea) and making sure you don't go in on an empty stomach. The aftercare is much more important than the pre-care. Refer to your artist for proper after-care, but as a general rule, keep it hydrated (I use aquafor), try not to scratch it (the itchy period onset can be from 3 days to 1.5 weeks and last about a week), and keep an eye out for unusual inflammation or exudate.   Have fun!"
bodymods,39mqtk,dneronique,2,Fri Jun 12 23:15:23 2015 UTC,"1-2 inches is rather small, especially for detail- and you don't want to sacrifice detail for size.  As for what it feels like, I'd say kind its kind of like a burning feeling, depending on where you choose for placement pain varies. The ""worst"" places are places like ribs, or feet, places where skin is thin.  That being said, all my tattoos are on my ribs. The pain isn't something that should make you reconsider placement. In the end its worth it.   I recommend you bring water, some people tend to get light headed or dehydrated.  Maybe bring someone with you or headphones to distract you from the buzz of the needle, its natural reaction to kind of flinch from something that causes you pain.   I hope it goes well!  Edit; it seems like a no brainer, but afterwards your fresh tattoo will be itchy- for the love of sweet baby jesus, DO NOT SCRATCH or pick at your scabs."
bodymods,39mqtk,rolyat_alle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:22:56 2015 UTC,"Again, DO NOT SCRATCH OR PICK. If it's reeeeeeally itchy and you just have to do something, I give it a little pat. Also, you really don't want to keep it bandaged for all that long. The only time I've ever slept in bandages is when I got it done and then went home and straight to bed."

bodymods,39gev9,poutinethrowawayx,5,Fri Jun 12 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"The reason you may find that it's flattened out a lot - and likely will continue to do so is the method by which they were done.  Pointing/vs shaping. This method very often leaves a lot of tension on the connection point of the wound and many people see them pop back open. No less, many people prefer this look over the shaped ones and it's ultimately just what happens.  For -what I assume is Russ Foxx's work- These look pretty good!  Hopefully they stay as are and you don't see any more separation."

He over charges among other problems. For example, This isn't just my own experience but many friends. We're talking maybe twenty other people I know that had him take at least a second, often a third go at it if not just  ended up going to somebody else. Skimping on sutures to save material leads to lots of regrowth.   Depending on where you are there are options for who to see. Closest I believe to Vancouver is Dan Marshall in Calgary. Best to have a healed large gauge piercing prior to splitting."

The week following was not as fun, my tongue was tender and trying to speak with a piece of metal through it was not easy to start with. Also, I still sometimes accidentally bite it because I just assume it's food :/  Take ibuprofen for the pain (it's an anti-inflammatory so it helps with the swelling too), and I was told to fill a glass with warm water and add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and rinse my mouth with it. My piercer literally said to me ""do not rinse it with anything else. No mouthwash, even if it's non-alcoholic, not even the tears of Jesus. Just salt water."""
bodymods,39ea6s,whoreshandbag,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:54:41 2015 UTC,"I have my tongue pierced three times. (One center, and on either side.) My center one was a piece of cake to pierce. 1/10 for pain, the healing was a bit painful though. I swelled up a lot and took about four days to be able to eat solid foods again, but definitely worth it!   The two side piercings were closer to an 7/10 piercing pain, mainly because there's more tissue and my adrenaline was used up by the second pierce. Healing was pretty much the same though.  Edit: I don't think I could compare it to another piercing. I've had 32 piercings, and the tongue is pretty unique, for myself anyway. I don't normally swell with any other piercing. Just keep in mind it's one of the fastest places to heal, so any discomfort will go away quickly."

Talking wasn't a good idea, that aggravated it.

I remember it being incredibly sore later that evening (I got it pierced midday), and into the next day. Some crushed ice and ibuprofen helped immensely. My friends found my lisp while healing hysterical; I found talking slightly painful. I could eat alright, I suppose. It was really difficult to swallow, especially foods that were soft or more liquid (like smoothies or oatmeal). I remember having luck with small tortellinis cut in half, chewing on the far back molars. I don't really remember the cleaning actually... I think it was a mouthwash of some type? In any case the cleaning was incredibly simple (especially if you've had your nipples done. I know how annoying those can be). I had absolutely no issues with swelling or bleeding or really anything. There was a tiny bit of swelling, but it only lasted a couple of days and was very minor. I ended up changing the jewelry about a half of a week early to something smaller and more comfortable because I was all healed.    The only thing I notice today is that although I don't have a slight lisp now that it's healed like people expect, I do have to talk slower thanks to my tongue being a bit more clumsy with a bar through it."

All in all, the proceedure didn't hurt much at all. The worst part was limiting spicy food, fermented beverages, and oral sex. I will say that it did HURT LIKE HELL when I bit my tongue a time or two tho.  As for healing procedure you definitely want to listen to what a reputable piercer tells you but I just gargled with sea salt water after eating anything and had no issues other than a slight lisp for a couple of days.

I cleaned with non-alcoholic mouthwash after everything I ate, just to make sure there wasn't any lingering food that could irritate/infect the piercing.  Really, it was a breeze.

This has happened to me on a few occasions. The bad thing is, there's no real way to tell, because they don't look swollen or any different on the outside. If you toss and turn, or don't wear a bra or something and it snags on a blanket or pillow, there's a high chance that that is what happened."

bodymods,393wbg,satanicmartyr,4,Tue Jun 9 05:56:50 2015 UTC,"My leg and arms are covered in SI scars as well, and all areas of SI are now covered to some degree with tattoos. If your scars are thick (keloids from deep cuts), consider using vitamin E daily to soften the scar tissue before you get your tattoos. Most importantly, and obviously, don't tattoo somewhere you still cut, if you do at all. You don't want to spend your time and money getting a nice tattoo and then messing it up in a moment of impulse."
bodymods,393wbg,Roswyne,3,Tue Jun 9 09:01:55 2015 UTC,"Have you considered scarification or branding? Those might be better suited to cover/camouflage the scars.

bodymods,393wbg,showmebevelle,2,Tue Jun 9 04:34:46 2015 UTC,Do you mind sharing a photo of the scarring? It very much depends on the type and how active it is.

bodymods,393wbg,anthylorrel,9,Tue Jun 9 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"Ok so the tissue still looks quite active, I recommend using emu oil/bio oil etc to try and soften it up a little.  We usually tell people to give it 3 - 6 months after that to let it all settle and then we go for it.  Everything that /u/maihar said is awesome advice, I suggest following that."
bodymods,393wbg,satan-says-meow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:33:19 2015 UTC,My artist said that once the scars have settled down that they are usually fine to tattoo over. She also recommends going with something fairly heavy on texture to disguise the difference in skin color/texture where the scar tissue is concerned and because scar tissue can lead to lines that look a little blown out.

bodymods,38xju5,Dabbernaut,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"If your piercer knows what they're doing, they should be able to work around your frenulum, assuming you're not so tongue tied that you can't realistically be pierced, but that's pretty uncommon."

bodymods,38wn5x,Kat1yn,11,Sun Jun 7 14:55:41 2015 UTC,Not really. Stretching using weights would very quickly thin out the bottom of your lobes as all the pressure on the tissue is concentrated in one place. Best bet would be to stretch normally then wear weights when you're at the size you're happy with.

bodymods,38m9sm,SJLopos,8,Fri Jun 5 03:17:54 2015 UTC,"A single tear rolled down my cheek.   So, yeah, not gonna lie, yes they do hurt! The clamping alone hurts, the piercings hurt, and the second one hurts worse than the first. (The second one is what caused the tear!) But just stay calm, breathe deep, and the pain is super momentary. I'd say go into it expecting the worst possible pain you can imagine and then it won't seem bad :P They don't hurt that bad after though, just a dull achey type pain.   And what others have said is also sadly true, the healing process is long and...ongoing. Mine are almost two years old and the right one is still dumb sometimes.  BUT. Despite ALL of that, they're still totally worth it!  One tip I have to you is to buy panty liners, just cut them in half and they're perfect for providing a soft comfortable covering, you're probably going to need that for at least a month or so. And need to wear a bra while you sleep.   And absolutely do nottt let anyone put their mouth on them for a couple months, even when they seem healed, mouths are disgusting cesspools of bacteria and no matter how good an idea it seems in...the moment...it's really not. It will set you back.  Edit: Oh, I haven't actually found that they've ever snagged on my clothing though, contrary to what others have said. I have snagged them on my loofah in the shower which was blindingly painful haha but otherwise no problems there."

bodymods,38m9sm,TheBostonLady,2,Fri Jun 5 10:12:51 2015 UTC,"My nipple piercing experience was fantastic. It was like a quick pinch and over with. Salt water soaks were the best. Since they stood at attention all the time (they eventually went flaccid) they would get chafed so I would put Argan or coconut oil on them. Don't pick at the crusties it makes them hurt worse. Instead take a cotton ball with warm water for quick cleaning. Be careful with loofas!!!!!!!!!! Watch out for door jams. If you have tits like mine, they grab stuff! I didn't realize how often my nipples brushed the shower door until I caught them on it a few times. A really close fitting, soft bra is your best friend. Getting panty liners and cutting them in half helps keep your titties clean without over washing your bra. If you work around horses (like I do) put big band aids over them to keep hay & debris out of the fresh wound. They WILL get achey on your period whether you've had them 3 mo or 3yrs. Just do your sea salt soaks. For me putting coconut oil on them helped. Oh! Get some of those small ice packs for kids! Slip them in a sock and allow your boobs to chill out :) Don't let your SO put them in their mouth for a long time at least a few months unless you can soak them immediately after.  Don't change them for at least 6 mo.  If you have large breasts look into getting bars instead of hoops as hoops will cause more migration over time.  Hope this helps!!"
bodymods,38m9sm,Yourfavouritelesbian,2,Fri Jun 5 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"Hurts. So. Fucking. Bad. Hands down probably worse than spraining my ankle. They're sore and painful and mine hasn't healed fully (not infected, just crusty occasionally) and I got it done in september. It's a pain to wear a sports bra at night (either go in a sports bra or braless to the piercer, depending on your top size) and it catches and bleeds sometimes.   That being said, GET IT DONE!!! If I had to take out 6/7 piercings, I'd leave my nipple. It looks sooooo cute, it feels fine now that it's mostly healed (except for the times it gfts pulled). I have great jewelry in (pink gem barbell) and it looks gorgeous. Don't forget to soak it every day! If you want a good tip, shot glasses tend to be a great size for nipple piercings! They're big enough to cover the bar, and even if they don't cover your entire nipple because you have larger ones, the glass should fit entirely over the healing area.   Good luck! Remember that the pain is temporary and the healing is tough but it's worth it. :)"

All I did was sea salt soak them without moving them, twice a day for a week and once a day for two months. I didn't touch them. I didn't touch my nipples. After 3 months they were healed. I never had any issues with them after that. They feel amazing to play with. I do have enough boobs but not an over abundant amount. More than a handful but just. I got them pierced diagonally so when my nipples got hard, they wouldn't really look crooked. I kept the bars in. I love them.   Edit: added what kind of soaking I did."

bodymods,38m9sm,smashleys,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:44:39 2015 UTC,How do you compare the healing with the straight barbells and the curved ones?

I didn't want to say anything though because she's the professional...
bodymods,38m9sm,horizontal_vertigo,2,Sat Jun 6 14:26:01 2015 UTC,It just seemed to heal faster.  Also if you wanted to switch from a barbell to a hoop it would be easier to switch from a curved rather than straight.

Lost quite a bit of sensitivity in my nipples, although I don't mind that too much (never been about too much breast stuff anyways)... Took forever to heal, as everyone else has pointed out. Snags were a problem initially but I'm really used to avoiding them now (and I haven't even worn a bra in like two years!)...  Most importantly?

Needless to say my gf got the needle in about a quarter of the way and lost her shit that it wouldn't go through.

I didn't take any medicine beforehand, kind of just went for it and it wasn't bad at all. They hurt for the next 36 hours I would say, and bled at night when I slept for 5 days. I haven't had them for a full 30 days yet but they only hurt when they get snagged on something or I purposely try to inflict pain on myself.

The only difficulty I experienced was that one side snagged a little a few months after I got them done. For two weeks after that, there was a small red bump next to the exit hole of the piercing. That subsided and I was more careful about the clothes I wore. When it happened, I was wearing a pretty loose tank top. I'm five months in, now.

bodymods,38a1rx,girrrrrrr2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"It is a slight to almost uncomfortable, but not painful, vibration depending on the strength of the field. I have never had a problem with moving my hand away from a source to stop the magnet from reacting. It doesn't get hot.   I have never been woken up by it. The only reason I can think of for it to wake me up would be if someone put a device that caused a reaction near my finger or it fell near one. I do think that feeling could wake me up, but that would be a very rare thing to happen.   I do not play guitar, I am not sure how it would effect the magnet. Most likely would depend on magnet placement. I'll get back to you. I'll ask a friend to let me test that out."

It is usually more of a surprise when I find hidden magnets or power sources. I still get surprised by the feeling if I find it reacting to something I don't expect. The sensation is annoying to me if the magnet reacts to a strong source, it isn't painful, but I personally don't like the feeling of the stronger vibration. I think I mentioned earlier that it is easy to move away from the source of the reaction because you have to be pretty close to the source. At least so far in my experience.   I also don't particularly like the feel of the magnet flipping when I get next to a magnet that is the same pos/neg side. Although the guy who inserted my magnets says he loves that feeling, so it depends on the person."

Why he didn't offer to change it for you I don't know, but usually there is a ""Don't touch your jewellery in store"" rule in the more respectable places.   The guy's attitude was an issue, sure, that could have been improved; but changing it in store is usually not allowed."

What I did was for about a week,  massage bother lobes with emu oil twice a day.  Then you will need to size down a few sizes.  I went down to 38mm while still doing the emu oil massages.  After a couple weeks,  the thin part started fattening up and after another couple of weeks it was pretty much all the same thickness so I slowly stretched back to 44mm. Alot of people don't like the downsizing method but stretching and properly maintaining healthy lobes takes time and is worth it.  Good luck!"

For me, it really thickened up. I've since gone up to 2 3/4 inches (70mm) and now my right lobe is very thick (almost too thick for most jewelry) with no signs of thinning even as I'm nearing 3 inches.

I sterilize a needle & drain it,  then take a shower and clean it with dial.   Afterwords I spray bactine on it. Usually it fills up once or twice more,  but I do the same process,  and it's gone in a week.   Mine are not really painful either,  just a tad red with the bubble.   If there isn't a pus bubble though,  I'm not sure.   Mine suffer a little extra irritation because they are both pierced horizontally and vertically, so I think it's from the jewelry rubbing against each other."
bodymods,37i73k,Pandalove84,3,Mon Jun 1 22:10:13 2015 UTC,"This, without being able to see it in person, looks like one of the dreaded piercing bumps. It could be from a number of things, like low quality jewelry, being pierced at a wrong angle (which would make the bump a pressure ulcer), over-cleaning with harsh cleansers. How long have you had it and how are you cleaning it? A good first step would be to get higher quality jewelry in there. By the look of it yours looks like it's externally threaded- no good quality jewelry will have external threading. Find a reputable piercer in your area and see what he/she can do."
bodymods,37i73k,jordweaveswebs,2,Wed May 27 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"This. Also, it could be that the jewelry is too long. The length of the jewelry should be able to accommodate your entire nipple when it is not erect, if it is much longer than that, it's likely too long."
bodymods,37i73k,jessifox,1 point,Wed May 27 23:45:04 2015 UTC,It will be 11 months I've had them in a week or two. My right one is fine. I clean it with the normal solution with a q-tip after I get out of the shower once a day. Thank you for the advice.
bodymods,37i73k,jordweaveswebs,1 point,Thu May 28 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"What is normal solution? The best thing for it is a sterile saline wound wash from any drug store's first aid section. I would fill a small cup with it and invert it over your nipple to saturate the area and do that for 5-10 mins 2x a day. Start that now, and continue it even after your switch to better jewelry until the bump goes down."

bodymods,37crow,jbalazov,0,Wed May 27 00:08:35 2015 UTC,"Cartilage only comes part way down the nostril. Where the piercing is should have no cartilage. Some of the nostril is cartilage, I'm not arguing against that. But the cartilage should be too far up the nostril to be a part of the piercing.   Crappy source photo taken from a University of Michigan online textbook"
bodymods,37crow,jbalazov,1 point,Wed May 27 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"How long did your piercer advise you to wait? I waited nine weeks and that was a sufficient. The outside heals first, so looking at your nose is not the best indicator.   Having no pain is a good thing. A little sting is normal. But this means you went to a good piercer with good quality, sharp materials.   Changing your jewelry too early can lead to a number of problems. One being the hole not healing straight, making it harder to change jewelry in the future. Another is irritation or infection. Neither are fun. The first time I got my lip pierced I tried changing my jewelry too early and too often. My hole swelled shut and when I tried to force jewelry through, I almost threw up, and then lost consciousness, hitting my head on the bathroom counter. Don't change your jewelry early. It's not worth it.   Edit: Be wary of towels, open knit clothing, and wash cloths. These things will catch your jewelry and hurt like a Bitch when they pull. Try drying your face with something like micro fiber or just plain paper towel. The cleaner the better.   I currently wear a hoop and have worn it for about four years. I have taken it out maybe three times over the course of those four years. I MUCH prefer it over a stud. Doesn't catch on things and looks better on my face. The important thing when finding a loop is finding one that fits your nose and your needs. Do you want a little hoop, where it barely protrudes from your nose? or do you want one that hangs out a little more and is more obvious? Either way, I suggest going with the highest quality metal you can afford. Mine is sterling silver. Obviously if you prefer gold, 18 karat is good enough. No need for 24. Too soft anyways."

The pain of the piercing itself was quite bad, and having to do it twice in a row SUCKED. But they are my favorite piercings and are very low maintenance otherwise. I went on a run the day after I got pierced, and they were just sore like a dull ache. However, bumping or snagging them hurt for a while. If you want them I'd definitely recommend."

bodymods,36ntkq,MaddeyClare,2,Wed May 20 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"Probably not, no. It's just scar tissue or sebum that built up in the fistula. What would have came out when you cleaned doesn't have a place to escape anymore, so you'll have a little bump where it would have. Not all people get them, but for me personally, I have a small bump on the former entry and exit holes of my septum. They aren't hurting anything, they're just... there."

bodymods,36jp9j,welliesong,8,Tue May 19 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"From the positioning of the scarring, it looks like the two ends were pierced too close together, so the bar has had to stretch the holes out to fit properly and that's what's left.  As long as the flat section of the bar is still where it's supposed to be and this isn't causing you any discomfort, I don't think you really have too much to worry about at this point. I'd keep an eye on it obviously, but this in itself isn't massive cause for alarm."
bodymods,36jp9j,CheezyMcWang,1 point,Tue May 19 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see how it looks like that. At first i did have a lot of issues with it poping out when i bent over, unlike the one on the other side. It was measured with a huge special ruler thing so i dont think it would have been way too small.   Thanks for the help, ill see if there's any changes for the next couple weeks."
bodymods,36jp9j,erin_marcella,2,Wed May 20 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"Not a professional by any means, but had the same piercings, they did that before they started rejecting. But only on one side for me. The piercer told me it would happen, and that they couldn't guarantee they'd remain pierced for long. I got about 2 years. Such a shame, because I loved them! I guess all you can do is just wait and see what happens."
bodymods,36jp9j,erin_marcella,1 point,Wed May 20 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Aw, I don't want to see them go, not even got to summer yet. How did the regecting go? Was there puss and was it ok just taking them out at that point? I've heard if you take them out while they're infected it can close the holes and stop the puss from leaving the body safely. Sorry for bombarding you with questions, I'd really appreciate some info on your experience. Thanks!"
bodymods,36jp9j,zerpderp,1 point,Wed May 20 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"Hey that's OK! It wasn't anything dramatic or anything (for me, at least anyway). My piercing just kind of ""shrunk"" for lack of a better word. It wasn't super fast, so I'm sure you'll have plenty of time. I got told it's because it's a surface piercing, so they tend to just work their way out.  It may not even be that for you though. I guess all you can do is cross your fingers and wait and see. I hope it's not growing out already! They're such cute piercings!"
bodymods,36jp9j,Laprasrides,2,Wed May 20 06:17:47 2015 UTC,"I could totally be wrong (as I am not a professional is any way) but it looks like irritation from either friction, or the bar being too small. Please correct me if I am wrong."
bodymods,36jb5z,StretchedEarsArePerf,5,Tue May 19 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"Are they sore to the touch?  You should probably downsize, wear glass, sleep without plugs.  Once the pain is gone, you can do some gentle vitamin E rubs (or similar oil) and you should see them back to normal eventually.  No one can tell if you'll be able to stretch again - but your focus now should be to heal away any damage caused and go from there."
bodymods,36jb5z,CharlesEmerson,2,Tue May 19 21:04:34 2015 UTC,Are you saying you stretched with silicone or wore silicone? If the latter you should be fine. Silicone is safe to wear.

bodymods,36c39m,emkcj,1 point,Mon May 18 04:35:26 2015 UTC,"How long will you be there for? If it's a temporary thing, my advice is just to wait until you leave to get pierced.   If you're moving there for good, I would honestly recommend taking the few hours out of your day to go to a shop in another state with APP backed piercers. Being a part of the APP means that you're certified in doing quality piercing work. But if a pierxer isn't apart of this group, they either didn't care enough to give customers peace of mind about their piercings or aren't following APP standards. And you want your piercer to know what they're doing!"
bodymods,36c39m,Ellebogen,3,Mon May 18 21:37:49 2015 UTC,"Being part of the APP does not certify you in anything. It means that you've met a minimum standard of operations/equipment/shop environment and jewelry. That isn't to say that it's a bad place to start because generally speaking an APP piercing has dedicated some amount of time and effort into meeting these standards which usually means that they care. If you can find one (via the APP website if youre unsure) than it's a great start! Biggest thing is to do your research, not be afraid to ask any questions you may have to whomever you end up going to and not to accept any answers you're unsure of."

bodymods,36abtg,ThDaltor,10,Sun May 17 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"Oh wow... um.   DON'T SELF PIERCE. You are not a piercer. No matter how ""sterile"" you think it was, and how you think you know what you're doing because you looked it up online, it's WAY unsafe. ALWAYS go to a professional. You stretched a fresh piercing...? You should have waited at least 6 weeks to change the jewelry and a couple months to begin stretching. You are stretching way way way too fast. From 18g to 12g you should wait 1-2 months between each size. After that, 3+ months.    This is why I'm not a fan of stretching kits. Tapers stretch you ears far before they're ready. If you want healthy ears, you really shouldn't be using tapers at all. Wear implant grade steel or glass plugs (NEVER ACRYLIC) and wait until the piercing stretches naturally.  You should really take your jewelry out and let them heal if you hope to have healthy lobes."

bodymods,36abtg,lucidtwitch,-6,Sun May 17 20:19:49 2015 UTC,"Some people stretch nicely in a short period, most don't. This subreddit is full of safety police who probably don't know dick about sterile protocol. I wouldn't post things like this here or you will have a bunch of idiots yelling at you to go to a shop, despite the fact that most shops also don't know dick about sterile protocol. Honestly, your lobe is probably torn up with tons of micro-tears and will scar pretty bad. If you keep pushing it, it will only make matters worse. Once it heals, there are people that can scalpel away the scar tissue and put a larger plug in, but I would be very wary of who you trust with that. While self-piercing is normally fairly safe if done in a clean setting (despite what the detractors here say), inexperienced scalpel work is really dangerous. I suggest you take a little more time to do your research before you try anything like this again.   I suggest starting here.  http://www.piercingbible.com http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Category:Piercings"
bodymods,36abtg,fleshhook,5,Sun May 17 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"If self-piercing was safe, it would not be so hated.  It's hated because even if you had sterile gloves, a sterile needle, sterile jewelry, and you were very careful about cross contamination (which 99% of self piercers are none of these), you are still not a piercer. You haven't been through training. You don't have a sharps container for the needle, and that needle with all of your bacteria on it could hurt or infect anyone when that needle goes through the garbage bag. Any piercer worth their salt knows proper sterile protocol. It's a very important aspect of safe piercing to the APP.   Tl;dr: go to a piercer."

It's a good idea to eat real food as soon as you can, after piercing your tongue is in spasm and chewing properly can help relax it.  That being said, ask an actual piercer if you aren't too confident about some foods, I'm just speaking from personal experience."

They can take more than 6 months to heal and my guess if discomfort while grinding on your boyfriend is a concern, even if it isn't uncomfortable, grinding will probably irritate the piercing making it take longer to heal.

Seems the way you're stretching with surgical steel and titanium is the best bet.   Some people also stretch with silicone but that is highly frowned upon, it creates a seal and cuts off oxygen to healing tissue.   Clay is a bad material at all time.

bodymods,33b6s8,lsm717,7,Tue Apr 21 02:38:13 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm 18, and I currently have 9 piercings (nostril, belly, triple lobes, outer conch), so I have a bit of experience with them. I recommend reading the /r/piercing FAQ, there's a ton of worthy information on there! You should also check this out, if you want: This is a link to finding the closest APP shop to you. APP shops are certified piercing specialists.  Before your actual piercing takes place, ask the piercer what kind of jewelry they use, and compare it with the metals and internally threaded jewelry mentioned in the FAQ above. Observe that your piercer is using sterile equipment and gloves, and make sure you feel comfortable around your piercer! The actual piercing must be done with a needle - if they want to use a gun, then get the hell out of there. Your piercing will be pretty quick - every piercer I've encountered has said, ""Take a deep breath, and 1, 2, 3!"" And then it's over. It's very simple. For me, the lobes are very easy to pierce, and I felt no pain from it at all. It felt somewhat similar to a knife sliding through warm butter!  After your piercing, it may feel warm and may have small bit of pain when you touch it. Do not touch your piercing unless your hands are nice and clean. For cleaning it, follow the instructions on the FAQ for saline soaks. I personally used saline soaks for all of my piercings, and all of them healed properly. For some people, saline soaks don't work, but I recommend starting with them. Also, keep open communication with your piercer. If something is wrong with your piercing, go back and talk to them.   All in all, piercings are easy and awesome. Take care of it, and it'll be an awesome addition to your body! Good luck!  Edit: Check out the sidebar on this subreddit and /r/piercing. Both have awesome information on jewelry and discussion places."
bodymods,33b6s8,cellared,0,Tue Apr 21 03:41:44 2015 UTC,Why are the piercing guns so bad?
bodymods,33b6s8,TheArgyleGargoyle,9,Tue Apr 21 08:37:42 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that they cannot be autoclaved / sterilized so they can transmit diseases from one patron to another, most people using guns have not been properly trained in aseptic technique or placement, and the earrings the gun inserts are extremely blunt compared to a piercing needle, thus causing far more tissue damage than necessary. Plus, gun earrings are often made of inappropriate metals for piercings."
bodymods,33b6s8,breadstick69,2,Tue Apr 21 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"Piercing needles are hollow and create a hole for the piercing to fit in.  If you were putting paper in a metal ring binder would you jam it onto the rings, or would you hole punch it first?"
bodymods,33b6s8,myheadhurtsalot,3,Tue Apr 21 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"Close, but not quite accurate. Piercing needles create curved slits, they don't make a hole where a piece of flesh is removed. That requires a biopsy punch."
bodymods,33b6s8,J0HNN0,-4,Tue Apr 21 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"I had a ladder of 29 in my ear... piercing guns seem to be fine in your lobe... but not through the cartilage,  a needle will take out a core and it will heal much faster than punching a pin through it. Biggest advice is don't touch them until they heal and don't let other people touch them until they heal. Chechnya the jewelry and ask if anyone has problems with them. Chemists seem to use cheap studs. I never had to use saline during the healing period,  washing my hair in the shower was enough. Wash your hands and fingernails before even thinking about touching the new piercing. If you get rings do not rotate them if they are crusty. Think seriously about placement if you intend to get more. I found a body piercer was 200% better than the chemist, pain, service, healing and placement. If they get infected try and keep them in and persevere."

bodymods,33b6s8,firdy,-1,Tue Apr 28 19:27:30 2015 UTC,Two things 1) The shampoo I use contains Tea Tree oil in it. Will that be a problem? 2) the earrings I would want to wear pretty much all the time would be just black plugs maybe 8 mm in diameter. What's the likelihood that a body piercer would have those so I can start with them from the get go?
bodymods,33b6s8,firdy,2,Tue Apr 21 12:14:32 2015 UTC,"please do not put shampoo near piercings- it's effectively an open wound and you wouldn't put shampoo in an open wound. just rinse it in the shower or use sterile saline.  most earlobe piercings are done at 1.6mm or smaller, but it is possible to start larger. however, i don't think you'll be able to start at 8mm but it depends on your anatomy. You should go find a piercer and tell them you want 8mm lobes and see what they recommend. some may offer a dermal punch but i reckon they'll pierce you at a smaller size and advise you to wait until it's healed fully and then stretch up slowly.   If you can start at 8mm they'd probably have to order in the jewellery, so you wouldn't be able to go and get your ideal piercing and jewellery all on the same day."

bodymods,33b6s8,darth_unicorn,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"No no no. I know this isnt what you want to hear but piercings will take place with a 1.6mm size bar maximum. If you are planning on stretching the lobe piercings you should wait 6 months after healing before even begining to stretch. You should never stretch more than a mm at a time and should never stretch quicker than once every fortnight. You should also see of your piercer will help you stretch. A lot of places do. Going up faster than that, or stretching more often, or trying to start before the original piercing has fully healed can lead to infection, tearing, blow outs, scar tissue build up .... just basically dont do it. If you want this, you need to do it right.  Source: worked in peircing studio for years, and saw all the ways it can go wrong if you dont do it right."

bodymods,335tlj,oracle_thedream,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"That's the issue. She bought the star because the shop didn't have what she wanted and told her a bunch of websites so that she could get what she wanted. She doesn't want the circular end and then have to wait 6 months for it to heal to have the jewelery she wanted from the beginning put in.   I don't know why the shop said that they wouldn't pierce her with the star, they started by saying they wouldn't pierce with jewelery that wasn't from the shop so when we reminding them that the piercer told her to get her own they then said he wouldn't do it with the star. This is all through the receptionist, the piercer wouldn't come out and talk to us.  Maybe I'll call and ask again, because I do want an APP shop to do this for her."
bodymods,335tlj,oracle_thedream,3,Sun Apr 19 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that doesn't make sense at all to me. Honestly I'd just request to talk to the piercer straight away, seems like they've got a crappy receptionist"
bodymods,335tlj,fleshhook,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:20:43 2015 UTC,And pretty much any good shop will custom order jewelry and they do quite often. That's pretty weird that they told her to order online

bodymods,334k3c,YoMommaIsSoToned,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:56:31 2015 UTC,I take a lot of time and care shaving. You'll find that the hair between the piercings grows thin because it's coming up through scar tissue. At least I do. For a special occasion I'll use some really sensitive hair removal cream. But make sure to shave maybe 3 days (depending on your growth) before to mKe it easy on yourself

Some people have good luck with acrylic in a healed piercing, but it really isn't suitable for stretching or wearing in a freshly stretched piercing. They can't be sterilized and can harbor bacteria pretty easily. Additionally, if you wear your tapers you risk them healing unevenly. I'd recommend getting a stretching kit made of steel that includes plugs."
bodymods,334aax,TheDumbCaddie,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:25:39 2015 UTC,oh i know that - i put in actual jewelry like a minute or so after i go up a size! i was just wondering whether i'd be able to do anything with my previously used tapers - i've got everything up to 10mm sitting around doing nothing!
bodymods,334aax,firdy,2,Mon Apr 20 08:22:33 2015 UTC,You should put in actual jewlery as soon as you stretch. Put a single / no flared plug at the end of the taper and follow through with it.  EDIT: oops I misread and thought you said you wait a month to put jewlery in. My bad!
bodymods,334aax,BakerELMT,2,Mon Apr 20 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"even so, they're not suitable for using as stretching imo. they don't slide through as easily as steel or titanium"

bodymods,334aax,Moonpiles,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:44:35 2015 UTC,"Buy one pair of jewelry at a time.  Cost < Health.  You can buy glass plugs for $10-$15/pair (at least up to 00)at your local piercing shop, and with 4-12 weeks between stretches you have plenty of time to save up the cash for it.  Stretch properly now so that you're not the idiot whose ear rotted off, ripped, or got infected.  Tapers are not good for stretching and acrylic is REALLY BAD for stretching/healing piercings.  There is absolutely a way to make this work with your budget and no reason you need the entire jewelry set when you start stretching."

It's almost impossible to not jerk back accidentally at first impact, which means either you get a light burn that won't scar well/all over, or you press back down immediately and instinctively creating a doubled design that heals looking like Bam's ass in Jackass 2.    Even if you're a super badass and can maintain it at the proper pressure for the exact amount of time to create a perfect brand, you probably aren't going to have a good enough angle to get the pressure completely even or the placement 100% perfect (it's not like you can clean up and try again like a misplaced tattoo stencil).  And let's be honest, you're probably not as much of a badass as you'd like to be!  Tldr: Don't brand yourself, you're asking for a disaster."

bodymods,32n95k,BakerELMT,5,Thu Apr 16 04:28:30 2015 UTC,"So you got one fucked up tattoo by not researching your artist, and are going to have it touched up by someone else who you are also not researching.  Please, stop.  Look into the artist and several more.  Look through their portfolios and specifically look for cover up work.  Find out how long they've been in the field, what they specialize in, and what styles they're strongest in.  Look at their color work, line work, and artistic ability.  What you have now can probably be fixed by a good artist, but if someone else adds onto it and fucks it up, you may be stuck with something even worse.  Don't take chances with your body mods."

bodymods,32n95k,saucededuck,8,Wed Apr 15 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"Please take this as a lesson for your future tattoos. I don't mean to put you down for this, really your artist should have been better at the whole process including showing you something that at least looked like what he was preparing to tattoo.   The most important thing to take away from this is like others have said, research your artist. Have you seen any watercolor style tattoos in their portfolio? If not, why did you think they could pull it off?   Some people will say, ""My artist is the only person I trust."", and while that is fine if you only intend to ever get one style, this is not the best option if you want to mix it up. Sure, some people do many styles well, but you will mostly find that they only excel in one. I find the best one for the job, if it happens to be my home artist great! But if not, he understands, and his fellow shop artists might be open to taking on my idea."

Sure part of the responsibility is on the person for not researching well enough, but the artist is the professional being paid to perform a service - they should know what they're doing or make it clear why if they don't.  I'd happily go back to an artist who said ""I'm not comfortable or familiar with watercolor tattoos, but I can do something like this for you instead!"" but shun an artist who mindlessly accepted my request and then did something under my standards/expectations instead."
bodymods,32n95k,hlarsenart,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Also when they feel like their skills in that area are lacking they have no problems handing you off to another artist that would be able to pull it off better than they can. Some are better at realism, other's old school, and some can pull off that true watercolour look. Being able to realize their strengths and weaknesses and being honest about it is a good sign of a good artist who is comfortable in their skills.   You'd be hard pressed to find an artist that is a jack of all trades when it comes to (nearly) every style."

The people she went to used a patented formula for their tattoo ink and she signed a waver before they started. It turned out that she was allergic to an ingredient in the ink and tried suing them to find out what the ingredient was, that way she could know what she was allergic to. Since she signed a waver that specifically said the formula was a secret and that there were risks, she lost the suit and not only does she not know what she's allergic to, she has to take medication for the rest of her life otherwise her face swells up like a melon and she's unable to see.  Really the only point I'm making is make sure you know what you're getting and signing beforehand. I never learned who exactly she went to in order to have it done but it was a place that specifically did makeup tattooing. Be careful and be certain."

bodymods,32mk6l,imnotgivingyoushit,4,Wed Apr 15 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"Basically here's how it goes:  You go in, they apply some topical numbing cream, and it sits on there for a couple minutes while they're prepping equipment.  They'll evaluate your complexion, ask you how dark you want to go, then mix their inks on that.  Liner take around an hour for both eyes, double that if you want liner on your lower line as well.    It doesn't HURT HURT, but it's not pain-free.  Smaller and faster equipment helps with that.   Your aftercare is vaseline for a couple days to combat drying out, and eventually the scars will fall away, like with any other tattoo.  I haven't experienced any smudging, but they do fade over time, like any other tattoo will, so touch-ups will be in your future.  edit: If you go with brows too, it WILL look like sharpie on your forehead 'til the scabs peel away.  If you get that done, try not to have any pressing appointments in the few days following the work.  I had it done, then went to the ER that night for a completely unrelated reason... was slightly embarrassing.  8*)"

I've seen a few in real life though where it was obvious the person didn't know what they were doing (uneven edges, weird gaps between the liner and lash line). So ask to see their portfolio (if they don't have one, run) and check yelp reviews. I personally wouldn't do liner just because I wear different colors depending on the rest of my makeup but I am considering getting my brows done since I have huge bald spots where the hair won't grow."

I've always dreamed of double nostrils hoops on one side though! D:  And are those all types of ""clickers""? I reeaaallly like that quetzalli! I would also probably stick a small plain horseshoe in there~  But yeah I didn't even think about that- I need to get my cuspids pulled down since they stick out a bit weirdly and never came down all the way, and I have a bit of a cross-bite that may as well get fixed at the same time. I also wear a splint at night for my jaw, and go to a physical therapist who suggested I avoid at least a tongue piercing for now out of fear I would play with it and flare my jaw issues.

BF was totally against it, thought it was trashy or ""too far."" I can't tell you what changed (I asked him but he doesn't have an answer!) but it's not an issue now.  I will say though it was really disheartening to go through that essentially alone. I respected his dislike of it, and he respected my choice, but it's hard not being able to express excitement or even problems with someone you love - he would get upset if I showed him my tongue for the first 2 weeks or so, and I had to rely on my friends to talk with. Our housemate didn't even know why I was mute and drugged up for a week.  It's totally valid for you to feel this way, but you should be supportive - you might end up liking it (fake it til you make it I suppose). This is a major part of her now, and you both gotta decide if that will change anything  I don't know how to help, just thought I'd share a bit of my experience.

That said, don't make her feel like it's you or that.  Just tell her you don't think it's very appealing, and hope she takes it into consideration. Who knows, you might not mind it or even like it.   My SO hates basically every mod. Since we've been together I've sized up my plugs and gotten a lip piercing and 2 ear ones. He says he actually likes most them on me a lot.

If she'd done it without telling you and had a bit to heal you might not even notice for a very long time.  You are welcome to your opinion and it's perfectly okay to not find the idea or aesthetic particularly pleasing. But she's a separate human being and doesn't belong to you. Her life isn't devoted to you, it's devoted to her. If you really love her (or do so at all, you didn't mention) you'll support her in being the person SHE feels compelled to be.  This is her. You might not be able to love it (although it might grow on you), you have to at least accept it and move on."

My long-term so was one of the most attractive people I've ever met.  Just in my personal experience, physical attraction isn't going to make a relationship last.  If she has thought through the long-term physical (health), social (employment) and is emotionally healthy, then try to be supportive.  If she does get her tongue split and it's something you can't deal with then end the partnership.  IMO if it is a good relationship I don't think it will bother you.  I think the other factors I mentioned if given thorough consideration might help as well.  I'm not discounting physical attraction being a big part the courting process.  Just my experience that as I get older (29) kindness, work ethic and patience are what I admire in potential partners.  As I get to know someone and I learn of their good qualities they actually become more physically attractive to me.  Ok, hope some of that rambling was coherent.  Very tired and need to sleep.

If my husband said no to me and piercing I would laugh at him and then find a friend to hold my hand while I got it done. Bottom line is as a significant other you won't agree on everything but you will need to respect her decision. Now if she were lining you up for it - completely different story. But for your situation you'll gain a hell of a lot more brownie points being supportive than voicing negative opinions and really it might not be as much of an issue as you think, and if it is you go your separate ways but don't write it off before it's even been done."

So a single point single knee isn't common and one hook can only hold about 100 pounds without tearing, so logically I should have taken 1-2 more hooks to be safe... but noooo I wanted to be a badass lol and to answer your question, no, it didn't hurt. Your endorphins act as a natural anesthetic and I really didn't feel anything."

bodymods,31ky31,Interwebsmylife,12,Thu Apr 9 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"Ah this is something I've thought a lot about so comes with a lengthy explanation!   I'm a primary school teacher. My school has been tolerant of the way I look. The only time it has been mentioned is in passing at the start of the year thrown in with the other advice for dress; ""don't show too much cleavage"" and ""try and keep tattoos covered if you can"".   I always thought that I was going to be a ""visably modded"" person in a care position to make a point that good people come in all packages. Yes I have tattoos, piercings and coloured hair, but that doesn't make a difference to the fact that I am a good person, and bit by bit we can help change people's perspective. I also felt that the way I looked was a representation of my culture and upbringing, and just as valid as any other way that people show this.  Three years into my career and I currently have no visable mods. For me it's the flip side of the coin - if it makes no difference to the person I am, why do other people need to know about it? I'm the equivalent of a kindergarten teacher - so when parents hand their kids over to me it can be the first time they have ever separated from them. I want them to know that I am awesome at this and they absolutely can trust that their little one is in safe hands. As awful as it is, this is easier to achieve without piercings, and making a difference in the education world became more important to me than my own taste in aesthetics.   However, as the year goes on and I've won the parents/kids over I start to talk about it more... my hair gets a little brighter.. my shoulder tattoo comes out etc. By this point people don't really notice because they've already made their judgement about me and then it's more of a ""oh yes, of course Miss Jess has tattoos"". I feel that I have won more people over this way than by forcing it on them at the start, and trying to push them in the accepting it.  So basically my view has changed. I realised that there were bigger fights to be had in the education world than, what comparatively felt like, a selfish argument of of me being able to look like I want. I realised that these arguments were going to be more easily won if I wasn't obvious with my commitment to body mods so I tone it down when it suits me to, and then can play it up when it suits me to.  At the end if the day, having mods is about my choices for my body - it's no one else's business, and I don't feel like I need them to know about it to be happy with the way that my body looks."

The body can only heal so much at a time, and overloading it is going to prolong the healing for all of them, leaving you vulnerable for infection and other problems.   The healing time for a navel is 9-12 months, so getting anything done in that window has the potential to delay things. I personally would do nipples first, let them heal, then get navel and septum. That's for aesthetic reasons more than anything else, but they'd heal faster than navel so you could have them all done sooner."

Also stretching it hurts no matter what. I went earring free for about 3 years and the right went straight to 14mm while the left barely fit a zero.  Edit: I just realized it sounds like I went from normal earrings to 14mm. I should add that I stretched normally to 20 mm ages ago. I accept my downvotes lol.

bodymods,313mi5,riotjinx,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:26:39 2015 UTC,I've been 20 mm before. My left ear has just been like this from the beginning. I got it pierced at a 14 and at 10 it first happened and every size up since. We're talking about a span of 4 years to get to 20 mm also. I didn't just shove in bigger sizes every week.

bodymods,3124tr,robot267,2,Wed Apr 1 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer, different people, different pain thresholds etc.  It's one of the easiest piercings I've ever had. The (well lubed) cannula getting inserted wasn't pleasant but certainly not painful, more a vague feeling of ""that shouldn't be there."" The piercing itself was a sharp nip that lasted for maybe a couple of seconds. You will bleed for a day or 2 afterwards but that can be managed by frequently changing your underwear or using pads.  I've been circumcised as well, frenulum looks kinda like yours. It wasn't an issue, I just had to have it pierced off centre.  I was told no masturbation or sex for 2 weeks and this seems to be the case for most people although it will depend on how fast your body heals. Saltwater soaks twice a day during this and absolutely NO touching it, NO rotating it and NO playing with it: just leave it alone and you'll be fine. Once it had healed the and was moving more freely the only problem I had was that the bead on the jewellery rotated into my urethra a couple of times, not gonna lie, popping it back out sucked but the pain only lasted a second or 2. Haven't had this issue since I gauged up.  Pissing hasn't been an issue, I just rotate my junk so the piercing is at the top. Maybe I just got lucky but since I started doing this I've found that I spray less than I did before getting the piercing.  One word of advice, once it has healed up (and I mean properly healed up for at least 5-6 months) learn how to take it out smoothly. It's really easy once you know how but occasionally you may encounter a woman that wants you to take it out before having sex, it's a major mood killer if you need to mess around with it too much. I keep a sachet of lube in my wallet now so I can get it back in easier once the deed is done. I use smooth segment rings or circular barbells now because they're easier to remove by hand than a bcr. Some people will reinsert the jewellery through the fistula, I personally reinsert through the urethra, just depends on what you're most comfortable with."
bodymods,3124tr,the_mysoginator,3,Wed Apr 1 20:16:34 2015 UTC,It's not that bad but everyone is different. Healing times and maintenance is just like any other piercing. Also if you are sexually active you have to take a break from all of that while healing (very painful). Best advice would be go talk to a piercer.
bodymods,3124tr,mental_d,2,Wed Apr 1 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Very little maintenance, just wash it with water in the shower, use anti bacterial unscented baby wash in the shower.  The frenulum part will either need a picture or for you to ask your piercer.  It was horribly painful for me, but that literally lasted 2 seconds.  I had been drinking at a festival for 6 days straight when I got it done so I bled over a pint glass. Wear more than one pair of underwear, or get some pads.  Healing time didn't take too long, but my matress has a permanent blood stain now. After about 2 weeks I had sex with no issues and a condom."

bodymods,3124tr,audiocycle,0,Mon Apr 6 05:18:09 2015 UTC,"Apprentice piercer here, done my own PA.  Fully 100% healed, you're looking at 3-4 months without complications. That is, no catching or keloid development.  Safe to use after about 4-6 weeks, but it will still be tender. When it happens, there will be some blood, just don't freak out. Make sure you wrap it for a day or two after when you go to bed, just to save the bed sheets.  One of my least painful piercings, there's a bit of myth surrounding it, just because it's a genital piercing. Out of ten, I'd give mine a 4 on the pain scale.  Make sure you know what side you dress to when your piercer asks, what way you naturally hang. I did mine on the wrong side and it was agitated and uncomfortable for a time after.  Don't remove the jewellery for any reason before your piercer tells you its ok to change it. Even then, do it in a warm bath and replace the jewellery before you get out. I took mine out, got outof the bath and the inner layers of skin clenched shut in seconds due to the cold air. Had to ram it back through a day later in a second bath. Not pretty.   Other than that, just keep it clean. I used saline solution as salt water can be harsh, crystallize on the skin and actually cause burns in such a sensitive area.  I never looked back, the feeling of the weight on the end of my dingaling as I walk down the street is...interesting.  Also, protip: if you're looking to stretch it to incorporate bigger jewellery, wait a few weeks after getting it then start to attach small padlocks to the CBR. The weight will naturally open the hole and you'll eventually be able to use padlocks as your jewellery. Great conversation piece on nights out."
bodymods,311dna,koshosho,3,Wed Apr 1 09:42:16 2015 UTC,"you probably were too aggressive with your cleaning and irritated it. leave it alone for a while and it will likely calm down and get less pinchy and irritated. try to move it as little as possible, even if that means leaving it flipped up and hidden for a few weeks.   the crusties are your body's natural way of healing. removing them prematurely is akin to ripping off a scab--it will only make your body produce more of them! leave them be, and let them come off when they are ready to come off."
bodymods,311dna,sydn00b,4,Thu Apr 2 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"I would recommend doing warm saline soaks. So you can mix 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt with 1 cup warm water, and soak your nose in it twice a day. Its a bit awkward to do, I find that sometimes blowing air through your nose while soaking it in water to make bubbles helps too!"
bodymods,311dna,gore_whore_,4,Wed Apr 1 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"sterile saline is a MUCH better alternative. with homemade solutions it's very hard to get the proportions exactly correct, and it's easy for debris or other contaminants to get in the solution."
bodymods,311dna,sydn00b,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Sterile saline may be ideal, but for practical home applications like cleaning small wounds or piercings, 1/8tsp of plain, non iodized (usually sea) salt per 1C (ideally distilled) just boiled water is close enough. Really. If you were flushing out a deep internal stab wound, sterile would be better. But really. A piercing or two cleaned with that homemade saline on a person with a normal immune system really will be fine. That amount of salt works so well because it's salty enough to desiccate the bacteria but leave healthy bodily cells unharmed. It doesn't have to be medical grade sterile saline."

I was hurt, bc it is a smaller town and most of our customers are regulars who I would enjoy seeing each day, none of them seemed to have an issue with me.    Well, I ended up finding out who the woman was. She didn't shop there too frequently. And what really got me was the fact that she was extremely obese.

bodymods,30ul9p,NicoleViciousisDead,5,Tue Mar 31 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"Back when I only had one facial piercing (one of my nostrils), I went to visit my family in North Dakota. Things were fine until my grandma got relatively close to me and goes, ""Is that an earring in your NOSE!?"" ""Well, technically no. But, it is pierced."" ""WHY!? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?"" ""Because I like how-"" ""You were so pretty. You were SO PRETTY! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE!? WHY WOULD YOU DESTROY YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE!?!?"" ... ... ... So, that was a thing. Now I have three piercings in my nose! :D"

I've never had anyone be flat out rude to me. But my BFF had an aunt who claims to be a devout Christian tell her that her tats are a sign that she is possessed by demons. Some people are idiots."
bodymods,30ul9p,TheEmpiresBeer,3,Tue Mar 31 05:54:29 2015 UTC,"Ooooo I've gotten the ""you must be inherently evil"" thing from Southern Baptists here. My ex-boyfriend's mother saw a photo of me and instantly assumed I was a terrible person because of my pink hair and facial piercings. She even told him she didn't want to get to know me (we can only assume because she didn't want her preconceived notions that body modded people are evil to be shattered when she found out I'm actually very polite)."
bodymods,30ul9p,Lindseybugx,2,Tue Mar 31 15:01:20 2015 UTC,Did you ever meet the mom?
bodymods,30ul9p,TheEmpiresBeer,3,Tue Mar 31 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"Yep. She never did like me, always finding a reason to tell her son to break up with me. ""If she was a good Christian (I'm actually an atheist, but she didn't actually complain about that for some reason) she wouldn't have those piercings"" ""why would she get a dragon tattoo? Dragons are the devil, insert bible verse."" ""How can you like someone with big cow boobies"" (I wish I was making that one up). Everything she said to him about me was appearance based because I know how to turn up the polite when I'm around bitches. My mom always taught me to kill them with kindness, heh. That woman even had the nerve to say thinly veiled insults around me when we were in group company (mostly weight-based comments as I'm on the heavier end of average weight, legit curvy but could stand to lose probably 5-10lbs). I eventually told her off after making my ex-bf have a panic attack over something she said to him about himself. You don't do that to someone I care about. Ironically, he and I are still fantastic friends, and she is slowly losing her son because of her horribleness."
bodymods,30ul9p,Lindseybugx,2,Tue Mar 31 17:14:55 2015 UTC,Ugh that sounds awful. I'm sorry you had to deal with that :/ but I'm glad you and the ex are still friends and that he's drifting away from her. I hope it helps him. She sounds like a lot to deal with.
bodymods,30ul9p,TheEmpiresBeer,3,Tue Mar 31 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"Eh, it really helped me understand a lot about people in general. I had been living in a pretty accepting and open-minded bubble before I moved to the south and met her. Even if it was shitty at the time, I'm glad I went through it."
bodymods,30ul9p,Lindseybugx,3,Tue Mar 31 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"Well it's awesome you're using that as a learning experience and you sound like a cool person.

It's easy to forget not everyone sees it as art or self expression. Also I hope you're in a more accepting place again :-)"

I just stared her blankly in the face and responded with, ""I can hear you... and I'm in college. This is just a summer job"" She looked so upset that I called her out on what she said.  One of my favorite moments was when this little black kid runs up to me and goes ""YOU HAVE HOLES IN YOUR EARS! Did that hurt? I want to get some like yours but my mom won't let me."" He looked to be about 10 or 11 years old. The mom looked like she was going to pull him away from me, but after I answered his questions she smiled at me and mouthed 'thank you.'"

Now you have a place to hang your car keys where you'll never lose them. Ooh, and you could attach one of those nineties style chain wallets for theft prevention!""  I didn't let it bother me too much, but it stung a bit, especially because it was right when I got it and was excited to finally have something besides tattoos.  I had a few comments on my sloth tattoo (sorry about the jpg problems).  Before the second session, an asshole coworkers referred to it as a ""teddy bear"" and was insistent about it, even after it was done.  The friend from the other story commented ""Draw me like one of your French whores, Jack"" but I laughed at that one because I thought it was good."

Other than that there is a 24 year old bloke (I make note of his age because I find it appalling for someone my age to be so closed minded) at my day job who believes that society is still too conventional for tattoos and piercings, to which I asked ""so the girl down the hall with the few tatts and piercings (also becomming an accountant), should she be paid less than someone of her qualifications without mods? Should she be kept away from all the clients? Would you refuse to go to her on those grounds?"" To which he answered no to every question.

bodymods,30tj3i,freakydeeky105,2,Mon Mar 30 16:19:04 2015 UTC,It could be your body is sensitive/allergic to the metal in the studs.   Also if you have the studs out for long periods of time they could be closing up a bit and tearing when you put the stud back in as if you're stretching your lobes.  If neither of these is the case perhaps letting them close and then re piercing would work better.

bodymods,30ksvz,ickynay,9,Sat Mar 28 06:17:23 2015 UTC,"So this is a photo of my ear pointing. They were done in December of 2007 by a guest artist (PM if you are looking for the artist name) at Strange City in Edmonton, AB (shop closed).   As far as the process went, once the local anesthetic wore off, the swelling really took off and I was in an immense amount of pain for the first 24-48 hours. Extra Strength Advil was all I had available for pain and I ate them like chiclets. I cleaned the area thoroughly twice a day and tried to keep them covered as much as possible. At about day 4 bruising set in, and I had stitches pulled around day 10. About three weeks later they were perfectly healed, and I was the elf I always dreamed of!  If you have any other questions about the healing process, how this has impacted my hearing, etc, please ask away!"
bodymods,30ksvz,ratelbadger,3,Sat Mar 28 06:25:21 2015 UTC,"Steve or Decker? Looks great! Can you post a picture looking up into them? Is there a lot of empty space up in there? Any weirdness/funk buildup? Looks fucking amazing, for real. Congrats!"

bodymods,3097ux,Obesejubjub,2,Wed Mar 25 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"From a friend who's actually making opalites;   Although most of the jewelry ones are bearing the name and are made of a fusion from glass and metal parts they still get called 'gemstones'; they arent exactly gems tho. They are basically using effects the original gemstone got but in a less costly and cleaner look. Just like fake-pearls (and pearls overall who also get called 'gemstone' even if they arent really gems to begin with) they get classified as  'man made gems' and listed under 'gemstones' in most jewelry shop worldwide. The original stone actually mostly get's sold under the name ""moonstone"", ""tiffany stone"" or ""opal fluorite"", not ""opal"" itself.   So they are not gem's, but they still get classified as 'man made gems' :P"

bodymods,305g05,littlelithops,6,Tue Mar 24 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"I found that my(F) nipple piercings were the easiest to take care of in the healing process. The piercing themselves hurt pretty bad, but beyond the initial pain of the piercing it's been great. I went running the day after I got them and they were a little sore but it wasn't too bad. I'm only 20, so I can't speak for breastfeeding with the piercings. As far as sensitivity, they made my nipples really, really sensitive to begin with, but now (about a year later) I don't think they're any more sensitive than before I got them pierced. Maybe less sensitive, even. It'll be normal for them to be crusty for a bit, nothing a good rinse in the shower can't take care of. The only thing that still bugs me is if I'm shirtless and something snags my barbell, that shit hurts. The most painful experience I had was running into a doorframe a few days after the piercing, ouch.   All in all- very easy healing, not too much pain once they're pierced, and they're a lot of fun and I find them very aesthetically pleasing."
bodymods,305g05,how_does_one_noun,4,Tue Mar 24 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"No loofa near the boobies!!   I found that getting them pierced diagonally was a good choice since they never look ""crooked"" when my nipples harden. I find when they're straight they can look a bit off but if they're already diagonal it shows less."
bodymods,305g05,minminkitten,3,Wed Mar 25 01:22:44 2015 UTC,I got mine done diagonally as well! I love it!
bodymods,305g05,chestyheaven,3,Wed Mar 25 04:46:07 2015 UTC,"My nipple piercings were the easiest healing piercing I've had. Initial piercing hurt, but no more than my rook or conch, less than my tongue. After piercing they itched for a couple weeks and got a little crusty, but I had no pain after I left the shop. I would recommend a sports bra for a few days. I did nightly saline in shot glasses with them for the first couple months and I've had them for 5 years now with no problems. I haven't noticed any change in sensitivity, though I've heard some people experience more or less. They are definitely my favorite piercings and I can't imagine ever getting rid of them. I'll be that saggy old lady with nipple rings."
bodymods,305g05,snooptarts,3,Wed Mar 25 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"Unlike the other poster, I think they didn't hurt as much when I got them done. I have 17 body piercings and my nipples, as fair as pain goes, are not even in the top 5. It's like getting your tongue pierced-- it doesn't hurt that much when you do it, but it's really annoying afterwards. You don't realize how much stuff you smack your boobs off of every day until it really hurts to do so. It also made them much more sensitive, but I have small breasts. I have had both nipples pierced for about 7 years now.  I don't have any breastfeeding experiences for you, but as for aftercare, here's what I got:  1) Don't touch them. Don't play with them, spin them, move them around, KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS AWAY FROM THEM. This applies to any piercing. Just. Don't. Fuck. With. Them.  2) Do not allow other people to touch them with their filthy hands or with their bacteria-infested mouths for at least six weeks. (At first, you probably won't want them to).  3) Sleep with a comfortable bra on for a few weeks at first. Avoid swimming and baths. Showers are okay.  4) Don't fucking touch it. This is a real thing. It's called the LITHA rule, i.e., Leave It The Hell Alone. If it gets crusty (and it will), don't pick at it. It will come away naturally when you clean and use sea salt. Your body is amazing and, if you are reasonably healthy and take care of yourself, it will heal that piercing all on its own without you fiddlyfucking around with it.  5) Clean them about once a day, and get two shot glasses (or one, whatever) to use for your sea salt soaks. Those things are miraculous. Your piercer should tell you about proper aftercare. Make sure you are using a good soap like Provon or Satin. I don't recommend Dial etc. because it can dry your skin out too much. Be sure to wash your hands well before you touch your piercing to clean it. I recommend air-drying, but you can take a square of toilet paper (NOT your nasty-ass face and hand towel!) to pat them dry if you need to.  6) You can take a zinc and/or Vitamin C supplement to aid healing. I usually just make sure I'm really good about taking my multivitamin."
bodymods,305g05,thebloodofthematador,2,Tue Mar 24 18:58:32 2015 UTC,"I got both of mine pierced 3 years ago. I think it's probably the most painful piercing I've had done. Previously I have/had nostril, septum, navel, various cartilage and lobe, and vertical labret piercings (if I'm not forgetting anything). My piercer was great, very calm and reassuring. However, the first piercing hurt like a motherfucker. As if someone punched me in the boob, sternum and stomach all at once. The second one was way easier. I feel like often people say it's the other way around? My boobs were reeeeaaally sore for like a day or 2 (I was freaking out on the metro, thinking no one better push me and hit my boobs! hahah) I was a bit worried about healing because I had read that the larger your boobs are, the harder they can be to heal, but I actually had a super easy time. They were feeling pretty good after a few months. And I actually preferred to sleep free-boobing it. I found I was more comfortable without a bra.  3 years later they still get sore every once in a while but they're doing good. =)"
bodymods,305g05,sylviarr,1 point,Sat Mar 28 09:33:49 2015 UTC,I had mine done and kept them for about a year and a half. As any piercer will tell you everyone heals differently but expect it to take at least 6 months and don't change the jewelry for a year. As far as breast feeding goes for future reference I took my jewelry out about 4 months into my pregnancy because it got really uncomfortable. (Cause my boobs and nipple got bigger) They healed completely and I had no issue with breast feeding. As always with any piercing talk with your piercer and do all the after care required. Good luck!
bodymods,305g05,tvirushound,0,Thu Mar 26 21:22:19 2015 UTC,I had a burning feeling after for about 12 hours. It took 4 months to fully heal. During that time they would just get sore for a few minutes if they were pulled on. But it wasnt so bad. I like them. Worth it all in the end.

bodymods,302yh0,thethrowawayxman,12,Tue Mar 24 01:16:00 2015 UTC,"Can't say I know much about branding, but from what I've read on scarification, ripping the scab off will leave you with a more noticeable scar. I personally wouldn't leave it covered with saran wrap. It should probably breathe. Let it heal and see what comes. As they say, shit happens when you party naked."
bodymods,302yh0,myigga,8,Tue Mar 24 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"If you actually want to keep the scar, standard practice is to leave it covered in the cling film. The lack of air and increased moisture prevents it from healing normally (scabbing), forcibly creating clean scar tissue. Gross and slimy is normal as the healing tissue is not being allowed to dry.   If you are hoping for it to fade, leave it open, let it scab and leave it alone as much as possible. Pulling the scab is never a good idea in any case and will lead to uneven scarring, unpredictable results and possible infection.   While keeping it covered will help in the scarring process, it can be a hot bed for infection and heat rash if you let it get out of control, and some of those pictures looked a bit pissed off already.... So change the wrapping often, 2-3 times a day, washing the area each time. If you are looking for some mild irritation to increase the scarring, you can dab on some hydrogen peroxide, wait until it stops foaming, and kind of dab it off. It will kill the ""healthy"" forming cells, leaving more clean scarring. Spread some light unscented moisturizer (Aquaphor), over the area, and cover.   And this should go without saying....but if you start to get seriously worried about infection, go to a doctor. You do not want to end up with a deep infection and serious consequences from something so silly."
bodymods,302yh0,Slacktastik,3,Tue Mar 24 10:08:53 2015 UTC,"Hi thanks for the response. Should I keep clingfilm wrapping until it has healed into scar tissue? Or will this just keep it open longer and I'm then supposed to let it dry? Also I didn't so much as pick the scab as I did completely peel it off in one rip, not sure if that makes any difference! I'll look into the irritants and keep it covered for now and go to the doctor as soon as I feel like I'm out of my comfort zone with it."
bodymods,302yh0,Slacktastik,2,Tue Mar 24 15:25:26 2015 UTC,"Basically you are waiting for the wound to seal itself with scar tissue. You kind of want to start to see it heal from the outer edges in, the center may be a little crusty but, as soon as you can leave it unwrapped without it developing a true scab, go ahead and leave the cling film off. For something that size, maybe a week at most, more than likely less. Keep moisturizing though, just a light layer, enough to stop any cracking or dryness.   Irritation is up to you. People scar differently. Aggressive irritation can lead to blown out scars and more scar tissue than desired. Then again, some people heal very well and will not scar at all without some irritant. Lighter skin tones scar more ""safely"", yet lightly in general. Darker skins have more aggressive scarring, but can have problems with over growth. Peroxide is as mild as it gets, but everything from sugar to a toothbrush can be used to get the result you want."
bodymods,302yh0,audiocycle,3,Tue Mar 24 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"What was recommend and worked for me:   Leave it uncovered so it can breathe. Every 2 days peel the scabs and apply peroxide. Do this for around two weeks, more or less depending on how it's progressing and how visible you want it."
bodymods,302yh0,TheEmpiresBeer,3,Wed Mar 25 06:39:44 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert in body mods, but judging from normal life experience, what you've got there is just a normal burn in the shape of an X.

Your best option is to go to a professional piercer and have them take a look at it. Show them how you wear your glasses and they'll let you know if your anatomy can safely accommodate  the piercing.   Also, just as a side note, glasses make this piercing super easy to hide as well!

The gonzo one was irritated for about 10 days and then kept covered and moist. Because the skull cuts were so much bigger I only messed with them for 4-5 days.

I am taking a risk wearing them, but I don't wear them daily and only for short periods of time. Surprisingly I have had no irritation wearing the polymer clay plugs, and my ears are extremely sensitive to acrylic, stone, and stainless steel, so most of the time I wear wooden plugs.  This is what I found on Duke University Medical Center site pertaining information to the toxicities with polymer clay:  http://duketox.mc.duke.edu/polymerclays1.doc http://duketox.mc.duke.edu/recenttoxissues.htm   Like I said, it's a risk regardless.

bodymods,2zpxdb,Ishotthatguardsknee,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"I personally would go talk to your piercer, then your doctor. I say piercer first only because they probably have dealt with this more often than doctors because this is their field of profession. See what they have to say about it and if they know of any clients with that issue. Then go to the doctor no matter what they say so you can see the medical side of it. They have equipment to see if anything went wrong. But i dont think it has anything to do with your period its just a coincidence most likely"

bodymods,2zolsq,TreyN7,0,Fri Mar 20 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"Generally brass is a good material to use in the ear. Its very uncommon for someone to have an allergic/generally bad reaction to it. You have to keep them clean because ear cheese reacts with the metal and goes green, but only if you are unhygienic.. Standard levels of hygiene (which should be used with all materials anyway) and they'll be fine. I have a few pairs from here, they are all really good quality. The only issue I have with this pair in particular is that the edge is quite fragile, being the design it is, its very thin metal that bends easily which I fear will break if done excessively, which is why I didn't buy them. They are gorgeous, though."

bodymods,2zi97s,Vanitie,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"Biggest issues i've personally seen in no particular order. His work doesn't stand up to that of those around him. He's 90% ego, 10% work. Lot of talk but when it comes down to it, he cuts corners. Not that price should play a role in who you decide to have do your work but he charges a premium for his name. So, imo you're paying more for work you could have another quality artist do for less or the same. In regards to piercing in particular he charges for quality jewelry but uses crap. Was actually recently selling bulk junk jewelry on  craigslist. I've seen him bare hand ""sterile"" pouches of implants and lay them paper side down on dirty counters.  - in the event that you're unaware, that means they're no longer sterile.  It's just about a quick buck to him. Maybe once upon a time he gave a shit but. That got lost along the way.  Everybody is just so caught up in being professional and not talking shit that they let it go on and people to figure it  out for themselves. It's just unfortunate and i'd rather see to it that people have at least some idea of what theyre getting into.   Everybody is entitled to their own opinions at the end of the day but. Make informed decisions. Know what you're getting into and  live with your choices."

bodymods,2zi97s,poutinethrowawayx,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:49:06 2015 UTC,Totally! I was once in your position and wish somebody had told me.  I found out the hard way. Just be informed!
bodymods,2zi97s,zedoktar,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:57:56 2015 UTC,"Sure. It was literally a cl ad /with photos of two full (50pieces each) trays  of low quality externally threaded + some acrylic end jewelry. Shit you could buy on eBay for .18cents a piece. He even tried to pawn it off as "" below market value "" at 2-3$ per piece. Not tha t it makes a lick of difference. Crap is crap, and it stands to my point about him being in this for money above all else. Anybody with a standard would have just thrown it out, because its that poor of quality.  As I had explained previously everybody is entitled to their own opinions and experiences, what I speak of are mine and what I've seen done. Out of curiosity how do you know that anato and IS are what he used? Did you just take his word for it? Because what I was referring to are three separate instances in which I've witnessed him make claim that metal mafia and wild cat were in fact anato or IS. To the unsuspecting client unless they custom ordered a piece how would they know?   As for the implant its difficult to attribute healing well to anything he did. Often we forget that we have these great immune systems to fight off any potene threat so. If he were to contaminate an implant prior to use - which is what I saw - then its up to the immune systems of those who got them to make it work. If you recall I didn't take issue with how he implants them, but rather his standard and ethics.  Its also been noted that as somebody who specifically focuses on heavy modifications its seldom that he actual does a piercing and that has notably effected the quality when he does. Its not quite like a bike where you can just pick it back up. Its a practiced skill. You're happy with the placement of yours and that is great! Congrats.  Not everybody is, a fact I've actually had conversations with him about."

bodymods,2zfg43,kailskails,3,Wed Mar 18 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"Ehh, from reading around it seems that medical workers in the UK are trying to get clarification on the issue since the WHO updated the definition of fgm last year to include the word piercing.

It's physiologically similar to removing a woman's clitoral hood. Which could be argued to give the same benefit of reducing pockets for bacteria to hide and increasing hygiene that everyone uses to validate male circumcision. I say either outlaw male genital mutilation or make it legal for parents to have their daughters clitoral hoods surgically removed shortly after birth."

I was just trying to make an anatomical comparison because I know people cringe at the idea of cutting anything off a vagina, but somehow the removal of foreskin is a matter of fact. This logic does not compute."
bodymods,2zfg43,KuribohGirl,10,Wed Mar 18 07:41:39 2015 UTC,Cutting someones foreskin off is nowhere near as life altering and traumatic as having someones clit cut off.
bodymods,2zfg43,candacedowning,2,Wed Mar 18 07:44:01 2015 UTC,"That is why i specifically said ""clitoral hood"" which is the flap of skin that covers the clitoris. The clitoris would be more analogous to the head and shaft of the penis. Which would be downright barbaric. I'm saying that, on the spectrum of things you can do to alter your genitals, circumcision falls between the piercing legislation and the ""classic"" idea of fgm (like removal of the clitoris or sewing the labia shut).   Edit: no legislation, just a question of how closely to follow the world health organizations definition of fgm for procedure and reporting, which now includes the word piercing."
bodymods,2zfg43,KillYourHeroesAndFly,1 point,Wed Mar 18 08:58:40 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference as I see it, is the age at which such events usually occur, and the circumstances surrounding it. When done by trained medical professionals at an age before a child will remember it, it seems less harmful. When done by force, usually without medical training, and at an age when the person will be psychologically as well as physiologically harmed from the procedure, it's a lot more barbaric. I imagine if it was common place to remove the clitoral hood in the same manner as it is to remove a boy child's foreskin, there would be the same level of physiological impairment in terms of loss of sensation, but not traumatic. If a man were to have his foreskin removed in the same fashion as a lot of FGM occurrences, it would be just as psychologically scarring."

bodymods,2zb3v9,she-bari,9,Tue Mar 17 02:36:56 2015 UTC,"I am extremely asymmetrical and I had the EXACT same concern. I ended up talking to my piercer about it as I trusted him as an artist. He asked me what I would do if I had perfectly symmetrical anatomy, and I said I would definitely do both. He said that if I would want both, then he thought I should do what would make me happy and not worry about the assume try -- he even guaranteed that if I only got one when I truly wanted both, I'd be back within a week to do the other because he has seen it happen a thousand times.   I took his advice and did both. In regards to accentuating the assymetry, I can say that it whether you so one or both, neither option will ""balance"" them out. But as someone who did both, I can tell you two things for certain. First, I can tell you that even though I still notice the assymetry, I get so enthralled looking at the piercings that I simply don't fixate on the assymetry anymore. And second, even though I still wish I were symmetrical, seeing my nipples pierced makes me so giddy and pleased that I'm happy when I look at my chest rather than upset. It has honestly boosted my confidence 100%.   So take what you will from my experience and make the decision that you think is best for you! Good luck! Not that it would be a big deal anyway, you could always take one or both out if you don't end up liking them."
bodymods,2zb3v9,TwoSparks,5,Tue Mar 17 05:21:48 2015 UTC,Just get what you want. IMO having both pierced will make them look more like a pair instead of different individual boobs.

Sure maybe in a year down the road I will, but for now I am happy with the one. Also, it isn't the pain of the piercing itself that is deterring me (honestly the piercing itself barely hurt, it was the least painful of all my piercings), I'm just a fan of asymmetry."
bodymods,2zb3v9,Susurro88,2,Tue Mar 17 18:37:34 2015 UTC,Single nip piercing could be cool. I used to date a girl who had just one and it was quite nice. It's a nice contrast to see the control nip and the variable nip.
bodymods,2zb3v9,dteeban,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:54:20 2015 UTC,I don't think there was a a large amount of difference with my boobs but I can say for sure I felt way more confident after getting both pierced and in my opinion it kind of countered the uneven-ness that did exist prior. I'm not sure if it is just that it takes the attention away from that but I don't feel like they look as uneven now.

As for stopping regrowth, I had my split done by Samppa Von Cyborg and his advice, which has worked brilliantly for me, was every morning pull both sides apart and hold it for about 5-10 minutes, then continuously use it and learn all the movements throughout the day, you do this until the scarring in the middle has gone away.

Would you say that having a split has affected any part of your life outside of what you choose to show? I like the idea of a split because it's a heavier mod that doesn't have to be visible all the time, which is the same reason I got my backpiece below my neckline. Do people ever notice it when you don't want them to?   I guess what in trying to say is that if I ever got it done I wouldn't want people to notice unless I showed them.

If you do a spot of research into the important structures present in that part of the face (lymphatic, vascular, bone, salivary), you'll find that these artfully dodge anything crucial.   Perhaps you're confusing them with a true mandible? These actually course along the front of the jaw with a good three millimeters buffer between jewelry and bone and slightly more on the front side.  Obviously they course through musculature, hence the solid initial 10g. This should prove sufficient to prevent a ""cheese wire"" effect in a might movement area.  Unconventional: certainly. Most probably wouldn't find the discomfort worth the aesthetic benefit. From there, they are an under-represented piercing and information is sparse. In theory, they should prove less problematic than the much more common cheek piercing.   But remember: we'll share the experience as they heal, such that the community may benefit and people may have more information with which to generate their own opinions.  This is not a piercing to be taken lightly. I conducted a good deal of research, consulted several high profile colleagues, and utilized the best jewelry possible.

Take a hot shower and massage your lobes to loosen them up, when you get out massage your lobes again with oil (jojoba, coconut, etc.) Then slide the plug in without a taper. If you feel any pain or more than a slight pressure, stop and wait another week or two.   One other thing to keep in mind, the stretch to 6g is the first 1mm stretch (I believe) so it may take longer for your ears to be ready than previous stretches."

bodymods,2yl8gi,queenblackacid,2,Thu Apr 2 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest buying concave back tapers which your plug slots into. They are sized slightly larger than the plug, so by the time your ears are able to fit the taper through, you're totally healed and ready. Grooved SF plugs won't be a problem then.  If it hurts or burns at all, stop. I've been there, thinking you're ready when you're not. It wasn't pretty. It really is important to listen to your body. :]  The absolute best way of stretching your lobes is to wait extra months and wear plugs made of steel. The weight of the steel slowly loosens up your lobes until you're able to just slot the next size in. This is called dead stretching."

It's a piercing i would strongly suggest having your piercer stretch for you - one reason being that we have access to things like 6"" tapered insertion pins that will stretch the pIercing MUCH more gradually than ones available commercially.   Apadravya's are considered one of the most painful to stretch. If this is something you'd like to try again once you're well healed up from this mishap, keep that in mind. It will be far more difficult, time consuming and painful to stretch this than any piercing you've gotten before it."

Soaking in a warm salted water bath beforehand definitely helps, as does waiting a year between stretches. Drinking a small glass of alcohol also helps for that final ""push"" but I can't recommend anyone do that (blood ends up getting thinned)  The satisfaction of doing it myself and the comfort of controlling the pain are worth the extra determination needed. I would never consider this an easy stretch though ;)"

bodymods,2yawlz,CrazyMarmoset,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:53:25 2015 UTC,Bondage tape doesn't have any adhesive on it. I've been looking into using this method recently.

When I do stretch I sit in as hot a bath as possible for half an hour to an hour. The jewellery generally just slides in without the need for a taper. This is not a piercing you want to force.

Long and short is you'll be fine unless it tries to migrate out of the incision. I've had a 2nd generation Haworth for a couple of years and even though it's fully healed it'll still move a little from time to time (or even flip if in close proximity to a strong enough magnet.)   It feels strange, when it flips its kind of unpleasant (but not painful) but it won't do you any harm. I just subconsciously manipulate it back into place with my thumb now, no big deal."

Which magnet style do you have, from what I hear the disk ones are prone to ""flipping"" though I haven't experienced it my self.   Also I have an m31 and a parylene coated cylinder in my middle and ring fingers respectively.

Make sure you are present but not in the way for piercings. Save your questions for after the client is gone. Research and clean when there aren't clients in the shop. And good luck.  My apprenticeship taught me everything I needed to know, and things I use 11 years later. It also taught me a lot about where I break and what to look for in a good boss. I had an old school dude teaching me for shop duties, and he was one of the ones who love torturing the low man on the totem pole. I had to detail all the cars of all the artists at the shop, help move his mistress' apartment, and lots of other shit. But in return, I was taught everything I needed for a career I'm still in 11 years later (although I tattoo now as well.) Don't do illegal shit.

Figure out what they're gesturing to, mark it, and have them double check.   I will say that something that is often left out is customer service. If you are calm and nice, your customers will be more at ease from the start. They will remember if their artist was nice or an ass and associate those positive or negative piercings with their mod forever. And word of mouth is a powerful ally. People give you a lot of trust by letting you poke 'em with needles, and generally they are scared as shit. Don't get too caught up in being cool to remember that."

If your ears have issues going 8-6g then I'm guessing you don't fiddle with your plugs much, which really helps loosen your lobes, but sucks when you just stretched. A roll is $2-3 at home depot or Lowes and will last you till 3/4"". 2-3 wraps every few days with lots of oil because that shit dries out your lobes like crazy and is pretty tacky and won't want to slide in too easily."

If you want to talk, go for it. But ptfe tape was never meant to be used inside the body. It's not medical grade or pure at all. Using something not made for stretching to stretch is a bad idea."
bodymods,2xr4cg,sydn00b,2,Fri Apr 3 01:09:22 2015 UTC,"PTFE is hypoallergenic. Perfectly safe for short term use in piercings. PTFE tape is ~3mils thick (.03mm), so it takes about 33 layers or 16 wraps to increase your plugs diameter by 1mm, making it a great material to gradually loosen your lobes up to the next size at a rate of 2-3 wraps every few days. It is tacky, but jajoba or vitamin e oil counteracts that, and you should be doing oil massages at least once a day so that's also a non-issue. I don't know what your point is when you say it isn't pure, what's your method for quantifying that? I wear all implant grade steel/titanium or glass (medical grade isn't a thing), but organics aren't medical grade and healed lobes do fine with that, and your lobes should be healed already when stretching. None of your arguments have any basis in facts, just opinion and false terminology."

That said, I'm not going to specifically ask to please random strangers on the internet when I've had 11 other piercings done at the same shop, by the same piercer, with jewelry no doubt from the same company, and have not had a single issue with any of them. That's not just me though, my mother has had some 30 piercings in her life, a minimum of 20 of which were done at this shop, and she has also never had a single issue.   Also, I never said that this was guaranteed to last as long as his did. In fact, I fully expect it to reject or have some issue that causes it to be removed within a few years. He never even said that mine would last, he said that he took extremely good care of his and has done everything he can to make it last but chances are that I wouldn't keep it for that long anyway. There's a difference between getting someone's opinion based on their personal experience and getting told the actual likelihood of similar results. Its a shitty place to get a piercing, and I fully researched all risks associated for months before finally deciding to do it.   I'm so shocked to get so much hate for a piercing just because people think it won't last. No piercing is guaranteed to last, there is always something that could happen that could cause any piercing to be removed. This piercing is weird, its uncommon, and it won't last forever. But if people on this sub will praise temporary surface piercings as if they're amazing, maybe they shouldn't care where I choose to put metal in my body or how long it will last.

Go ahead and use it. But this guy is putting things that something like 1/3 of the population is allergic to (nickel) INTO people's bodies! Even people who aren't allergic to it can develop allergies to it - and just imagine if that happens to you with your anchor here. You aren't going to be able to just pop it right out. Had you gone to someone who used jewelry that's meant to go into peoples' bodies, IMPLANT GRADE titanium or steel, that risk is gone. A dermal is just that, an implant; why skimp on quality?   His reasoning is simple: money. Cheap jewelry is cheap jewelry, and has a higher profit margin when he marks it up. So, he decides to purchase dangerous jewelry that isn't suited to be inside people instead of what's best for the customer. He doesn't care much, if at all, about the health of you and his other clients' piercings, which is why he didn't mind doing a surface anchor that's likely to reject. So what makes you think that he isn't slacking in other areas, as well?

The bumps look like irritation bumps, but they could also be the result of the trauma after your shower. You can buy some sterile saline wound wash and some sterile gauze pads, spray a bit of wound wash on the pad, put it in the microwave for about 10 seconds in a clean cup and then hold the gauze pad against your nose until it is cold. Just be careful to not put the pad on your face if it is still too hot, blow on it to cool it enough to not burn your face. The soaking will help with swelling and should help the bump go down too.

Surface anchors and transdermals can achieve the look, but having big pointy ends on your head constantly is about a million times more obtrusive and annoying than you'll ever imagine. Every single person I've known of with them has removed them for those reasons.   They get caught / snagged on everything from towels to shirts to pillow cases, are uncomfortable or impossible to sleep on even with the tops removed sometimes, you can't ever wear hats with them, etc.   I just recently removed my roommate's. He wore Anatometal bullet spiked ends for a while, removed the tops eventually for the above reasons, and then just gave up entirely.

bodymods,2wz6js,wintertash,1 point,Wed Feb 25 07:09:24 2015 UTC,"These aren't microdermals, they are the older, larger dermal anchors, designed from the start for interchangeable attachments and custom fitted.

Honestly, if you like the way it looks, I wouldn't take it out to get it repierced. The placement is fine as long as you don't plan on stretching your piercing to a larger size.

bodymods,2vl19e,SkinnyTheWalrus,11,Wed Feb 11 22:06:30 2015 UTC,My general rule of thumb was to wait about 2 or 3 months.

Which is exactly why the ""you HAVE to wait xxx weeks"" rules are ""okay"" to follow when you have absolutly zero idea of what you are doing, but useless when you know your body.  I got my ear's pierced and started stretching 2-3 days after that (with a 2mm expander back then and a 1.2mm base-piercing), 3 1/2 weeks later i was sitting on 12mm which was supposed to be my ""goal size"". But since i felt it's still a bit too small for me i went up to 16mm in another 3-4 days. Everything just with expanders (2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,14,16 mm Steps) and a desinfecting wound spray to clean 1-2x daily and after/before stretching.  Here's some stuff, since people love to go ""OMG LIAR""; Lobe after 3 1/2 weeks and at 12mm and the same lobe now at 16mm (even tho i should have taken that with normal light..).  I could take photo's right now (with my lobes even beeing perfectly round, since i didnt wear steel for a long time) if that's really needed, but i guess you get the point."
bodymods,2vl19e,SenSidethink,2,Thu Feb 19 11:16:31 2015 UTC,"Wow.. I guess you are just one of the lucky ones :) I hadn't thought of the round lobes thing but I guess the weight in them is what makes them droop.. Wish I had that, I've just reached my goal size of an inch recently after stretching for 4 years (with 1 whole year at 10 mm cuz of a controlling now ex boyfriend) and it still seems a bit fast for my ears!"
bodymods,2vl19e,Peculiar_Panda,2,Fri Feb 20 03:20:05 2015 UTC,"It's actually more a question on how to stretch them, how to clean them right and what stuff to use on them. My ex-gf actually was controlling me too and said to stop at 12mm because she was at 8mm. She went from 1,2mm to 8mm in a month too tho; Same way i did.  One thing that helped ALOT was the spray we used; It's a desinfecting spray that also works as a liquid patch on the lobe; Made them feel alot less tense around the expander after fresh stretches and they where perfectly fine (as in i could play with the expander without hurting at all and it went in/out playfully easy) after 2-3 days already; Which is what made me able to stretch again that fast.  Doesnt work on everyone tho; Another friend of mine went from 2mm to 10mm in ~2 months without any problems which is still WAY faster then any guide out there tells you."
bodymods,2vl19e,SenSidethink,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:53:12 2015 UTC,"At smaller sizes I was able to go a size a month. Once I was at 0g for a while, I started dead stretching and was able to go up a size every 2 months. It really depends on your body and what size you're at though. Your times seem fine, but expect to wait longer the larger you go."
bodymods,2vl19e,rpgoof,1 point,Thu Feb 12 08:04:13 2015 UTC,"I think it kind of depends; I noticed I had to wait longer between stretches as the increments of mm increased. I think if you can pull on your lobe and 1. it doesn't hurt at all, and 2. you can see a gap between the plug and your piercing, it's definitely ok to stretch."
bodymods,2vl19e,swampdebutante,1 point,Sun Feb 15 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"I waited around 3-4 weeks when I was actively stretching. But not everybody can stretch that fast without any consequences. I'd say waiting 1,5-2 months before each upsizing is a good rule of thumb."

bodymods,2vl19e,Peculiar_Panda,1 point,Thu Feb 19 03:53:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on how well your body handles stretching. I just tried it every 2-3 weeks or so, pushed a taper through until i felt discomfort, then took it out. If it went all the way through, great, new jewellery in! If not, ease it out and try again a few weeks later.   Another method is to wrap the jewellery with pfte thread seal tape, starting with one wrap, rewrapping every day to keep it clean. Every few days you go up a wrap (2 wraps instead of 1, etc.), if it's uncomfortable or difficult to put in, go down a wrap. I'm far too lazy for that though.   If you're set on having a piercer stretch for you, 6 weeks minimum. If it hurts, add a week or two between stretches. If it's uncomfortable but not painful, stay at that time between stretches."

bodymods,2vd575,justanother_account,3,Tue Feb 10 00:59:18 2015 UTC,"I just posted this in the /r/Stretched sub... It's sound advice that I've gained over years of research and talking to professionals - plus I've done a bit myself.  Single flare glass plugs are best! You can get color fronts in lots of cool colors. They're super comfortable, affordable, and great for your ears! There are a few companies that I would personally stick with - Gorilla Glass, Glasswear Studios, and Modifika... if you can find Frozen Fire they're good too :) Also, they're great for 'dead stretching' which is the safest stretching method...  The larger stretching community (including most reputable pros and the APP) generally recommends against using tapers and tape as well...  A single flare glass plug is absolutely the way to go! Waiting three months between stretches will give your skin time to regenerate collagen and heal well. The skin will also loosen around the plug and naturally stretch, making it possible to insert the next size without tapers or taping.  Now, don't get me wrong -- you'll still need some lubricant which can be non scented lube or Jojoba oil or vitamin E oil! But the plug should slip in without effort, if it doesn't then don't force it. Just wait a little longer. Stretching isn't a fast process, and you shouldn't race to get to goal size or larger...   I personally have been stretching for about a year and a half, and am only at a 2g but no blowouts and healthy thick lobes make me a believer in this method!  TL;DR - Dead stretching is simply inserting the next size. But you should read this^"
bodymods,2vd575,ProductiveThings,5,Tue Feb 10 06:39:33 2015 UTC,"You should do it solo; someone else isn't going to be able to tell if stretching is causing pain or undue discomfort. If you use tapers at all don't leave them in longer than neccessary, don't use them as jewelry, and don't use them past the 6-to-4 stretch, swap to taping. The idea is that using tapers after a certain size causes you to stretch too far in the time it takes to slide the taper through. Some people say to stop sooner, some say you can use them longer, but trying to go from 4 to 2 is where tapers started causing issues for me, so that's what I suggest as an end point. YMMV somewhat.  As for materials I suggest sticking to glass and titanium single or no flare while you're in the process of stretching. Those are the two materials least likely to make your body freak out. After that it's up to you and what your body will let you wear, really. The hate for acrylic is a mixed bag of potential health risks due to chemicals used in some acrylics, and because they look cheap. However, once you hit you goal size and are healed up, if you want to wear acrylic, go for it. They're your ears.  On wait times I would suggest at least three months. A lot of people suggest X number of months per milimeter stretched, but I can never remember how long they say."
bodymods,2vd575,zombiekamikaze,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:22:44 2015 UTC,"Acrylic is also porous so it can hold bacteria, so not good to wear in fresh stretches."
bodymods,2vd575,Peculiar_Panda,2,Thu Feb 19 03:57:14 2015 UTC,Right you are. I guess I should have clarified that the reasons I listed were why people dislike it even in healed stretches.
bodymods,2vd575,zombiekamikaze,2,Thu Feb 19 07:36:22 2015 UTC,"i started my stretching journey about a month and a half ago, and just the other day, i stretched to an 8g. how often you stretch is up to you and your  body. you should wait until you're completely healed before you think about stretching again. My first stretch was from my piercing size to a 14g (which was fine with me because i used to wear quite heavy jewelry) and i waited approx a week and a half inbetween each size. As zombiekamikaze said, nobody can tell you what hurts and when to stop.  you don't want to force anything. If you start a stretch and it starts to sting really uncomfortably, you need to listen to your body when it tells you to stop. the last thing you want is to tear your lobe. I've heard it can look like a cat-butt when that happens, and furthermore, it can prevent you from stretching any more.  I bought a kit online with everything i'd need to stretch from 14-00g, and it came with acrylic plugs, which, i must say, i'm not thrilled with. i clean them everyday, and still, sometimes when i take them out, there's gunk on them. So, as hypocritical as i sound, heed my warning lol. Don't stretch with acrylic plugs.  The kit i bought also came with stretching balm, and it is fantastic! definitely invest in one of those. Its a balm that has a whole  whack of different awesome oils in it that will help make the stretch super easy! i hope my experiences and advise have helped somehow! good luck!! :)"
bodymods,2vd575,finney1015,2,Wed Feb 11 11:11:08 2015 UTC,"Do it on your own minus the initial piercing.  It's too simple to be worth paying someone for, and furthermore you're just plain better off doing it yourself since nobody else can feel your ears for you.  You've gotta listen to your body.   Acrylic is fine for short term wear for most people (allergies and mild irritations can be common for a lot though), but only in completely healed lobes.  To be honest though I know very few who do wear it.  Steel, glass, wood, bone, and stone are much better alternatives and acrylic frankly just looks cheap and tacky in addition to not being well suited for long term wear. Don't wear tapers as jewelry unless you want your ears to be misshapen and dumbo-looking.  When tapering up (wash your goddamned hands first!), you should just push them in all the way up to the flat end, butt your new jewelry up to the flat, and then follow it through.  If you have trouble getting it inserted properly on the first try, leave the taper in for 10 or 15 minutes and then follow it through with the jewelry.  Also helps a lot to do it right after a hot shower.  Stop using tapers after you get to 2g.  The jumps in size start getting bigger at that point and tapers start being a lot more traumatic in my experience.  If you wait long enough and have particularly elastic skin, you can just start dead-stretching beyond 2g (simply putting in a larger plug/tunnel) and if you don't, you'll be happier using bondage tape (adding a layer of tape to the jewelry every couple of weeks until you are big enough to wear the next size up). As a rule of thumb, 6 months to heal the initial piercings and 6 weeks between stretches.  Some jumps will be much quicker, some may take much much longer.  Point is, you want to make sure you're completely healed before sizing up again.  If it hurts, you're not ready yet.  It should be virtually painless.  Yes, you're going to talk to a lot of other people who say that it hurts and who say you can force it and go somewhat quickly through the sizes.  Yes, some of them will have perfectly fine looking ears.  Plenty of people smoke cigarettes for years without getting lung cancer, doesn't make it a good idea though.   At the smaller sizes (like moving through 12-10-8) you might find that you only need a few weeks to heal between stretches since there is much less skin there to be healed.  The bigger you go the longer it will take to fully heal.  Use tapers up to 2g or so and then start using tape.  2g-0g-00g is a bitch in my experience.  If you go bigger than 00g, you'll probably know enough about the process and your body by then to not need much more advice.  :)"

bodymods,2vd575,khitsule,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can definitely do it solo. Don't wear acrylic, it breaks down at body temperature and shouldn't be worn in your body. Steer clear of other porous materials until your ears are totally healed (so at your goal size) like stone, wood, silicone, etc. I'd heavily recommend glass plugs for stretching, I used glasswear studios colorfront myself really just because it had a curved back.  As for method a lot of people use tapers because thats just what seems to be well known, and most on this sub will recommend taping. Personally I used neither - I find tapers tempt you to stretch far too quickly and are best left in the hands of a professional, and taping was just unnecessary ime although it may be useful for larger sizes (I'm only 00g). I 'dead stretched,' just putting the next size in when they were healed and stretchy. Absolutely no pain, stretching should not hurt - although I had a bitch ear that would sometimes hurt a bit/be warm when my other was a-ok. Like I said I used glass plugs with a curved back so there was never any corners or edges to deal with.  Don't skip sizes, and I would recommend keeping each stretch <1mm jump. It was around ~2-3 months between stretches for me, but it gets longer with bigger stretches until you finally hit the 1mm stretches (2g+ iirc). Speaking of which, when you get to the 2g-0g stretch, just find some 1g plugs and turn it into 2 stretches. You'll learn how long it takes for your body between stretches, just make sure there's no pain :)"

Remember that a tattoo is an open wound and needs to be cared for. You entire body would be raw and you wouldn't be able to care for yourself.   Furthermore, a full body suit is going to take 100+ hours. There just isn't enough time in the week.  Have you been tattooed before?  Your best bet is to do it over a year or so. Fly out for two full days of tattooing. Do an area at a time, an arm, a leg. Full back.   There's just no way I can see it being possible to do it in one short period."
bodymods,2v714c,alexanderishere,2,Sun Feb 8 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"I've seen people get full back pieces on those crappy tattoo TV shows (probably fake) and people who look as though they're getting the whole thing done at conventions.

bodymods,2v714c,beverlycrushher,5,Sun Feb 8 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"So a full front or full backpiece alone is usually 30-40 hours a piece of tattooing time, plus ~4 hours total of weird time where you're putting on stencils, removing stencils, wiping down, breaks, etc (assuming one 30 minutes per 8 hours of tattooing). Arms take 10-18 hours per arm, legs are another 20-45. So you are lowballing on hours.  As someone who I assume you don't have any tattoos since you are asking, you won't be able to sit for 7 hours. Even the best tattooers usually don't work more than 5 hours a sitting.  Your body just starts to give out. It's a sincerely large amount of trauma. Even if you could sit 7 hours, its doubtful your artist will or will want to.It's painful on the back to hunch over and its mentally draining.  My fiance is a tattoer and does full back and thigh pieces. He's lined one in 5 hours and that was stupid fast.  I think you really need to look more into tattooing and understand it more before you ever suggest this. A tattooer would likely not be willing to work on you in these conditions. Any one that would, you probably shouldn't get tattooed by."
bodymods,2v714c,alexanderishere,4,Mon Feb 9 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"Tattoo shows are utter bollox. They wear the same clothes and take ages.  Yeah you can do full back pieces in a day but they're incredibly demanding I both the artist and subject. You need to be in peak health for them to heal and with your body fighting infection and being constantly zapped by a consistent flow of adrenaline you're likely to not make it past day two.  I honestly think you should try to learn a bit more about tattooing and what your body can take before making a plan. I don't think it's feasible to do it. Both sleeves in a week? Sure. All the linework on your body in a week? You bet, with rest days!   A full suit ? Absolutely not.  Have you been tattooed before?"

Because of the diversity here, peoples opinions can vary extremely. Some employers don't care about piercings, some employers will terminate employment because of piercings. Like i said, vast differences.   I was raised in quite an old fashioned household, by my grandparents. My grandma stayed home and took care of the house and me, and my grandpa went to work and brought home the bacon. I was never allowed to have sleepovers or have my boyfriend in my room ever. That was just their preference though. I suppose my ""sheltered"" upbringing caused me to rebel in some way. I'm now 20, have 3 tattoos, a nose piercing and am in the process of stretching my ears. As I'm sure you can imagine, my grandparents are less than thrilled about all of that.   Going out, I've had lots of different reactions to the things I've done. I've had strangers come up to me and tell me they're so in love with my tattoo and ask me where I got it done. And on the other end of the spectrum, I've  had strangers come up to me and tell me I ""probably used to be pretty"" before i got my nose pierced.   Society is a scary thing. Especially when it's made up of so many differences in opinion. There's really no way of knowing what's ""normal"" anymore, and that's what scares me most, really."

My experience was more of a sharp pain at first, then throbbing throughout the following week with a bit of blood and a lot of swelling. Sitting was the biggest challenge...  When it came to self-love, things were tons better. Even after having retired it, the scar tissue still gives the same effect that the jewellery did.

I agree with the other commenter, go to a reputable piercer who has experience and can see if your anatomy is compatible.   It is slightly more dangerous than the VCH and the others, as if pierced incorrectly can cause loss of sensation. Yes, it makes it even more sensitive than the vch did, and it quite a fun little piercing.

It's very different than stretching a healed piercing normally.   As far as size, i commonly will perform earlobe piercings from 18g up to 4g.   Glass plugs work really well for large initial lobe piercings. Just find a good piercer who has examples of one's they've done in the past!"

bodymods,2ultxg,Brandon_utza,5,Tue Feb 3 05:15:05 2015 UTC,Stretching with weights put extra pressure on the bottom of the lobe and causes them to stretch unevenly; it is not uncommon for the bottom of the lobe to get really thin. Would not recommend as a stretching method.
bodymods,2ultxg,CheezyMcWang,2,Tue Feb 3 06:14:52 2015 UTC,Okay I'm drawn away from the weight method then.
bodymods,2ultxg,rpgoof,2,Tue Feb 3 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"If you're stretching with weight (dead stretching), you're recommend to just use glass. They are heavier plugs than say silicon tunnels, and will encourage stretching with enough time, especially at larger sizes. I've gone up a size every 2 months from 0g to 9/16"" using just glass plugs, but it really depends on how stretchy your lobes are. If you use weights, you risk uneven stretching and lobe thinning."

Of course, pain is relative, and one person's mild discomfort is another's searing pain.  Regardless, there is never harm in waiting longer, and some people's skin is just less elastic than others. 4 weeks is not terribly long. I personally don't like using tape, as I found it to get nasty and stick to my piercing after a short while. And also, wrapping tape around tiny 8g plugs is pretty much impossible. I used tapers up to 00g without issue, and I'm at 2 5/8 inches now."
bodymods,2ugtey,TheEmpiresBeer,1 point,Mon Feb 2 16:11:07 2015 UTC,I usually waited 8 weeks between my stretches. Doing it right out of the shower with lube helps. Also when I had troubles I put double flares in my ears while I waited. They help stretch both sides of the love  Good luck!
bodymods,2ugtey,wanderingdorathy,1 point,Mon Feb 2 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"I will always suggest staying at a size for a long time before stretching. At least a few months. When in doubt, wait and be patient; your ears aren't going anywhere! But that being said, I've never stretched without at least some pain, and this is even waiting years between stretches (been stretching up to my 00 for 10 years). If there is a lot of resistance, stop. If you stretch too soon or force it, you could damage your ear and not be able to stretch again or much much worse."

bodymods,2u8xht,minminkitten,8,Fri Jan 30 23:19:03 2015 UTC,"Here's a really awesome explanation I found online to explain it better than I can "" What if I need an MRI? Originally it was thought that the magnets would always rip out of the skin and attach themselves to the MRI. However, we now know of a few people who have the magnets have gone through MRIs and this did not happen. One person reported that the magnet just vibrated very strongly. Another person reported that the techs shielded his hand, as they would with someone who had shrapnel or other implants. However, there are several different types of MRIs, so we can make no guarantee of what will happen during your MRI, so you must discuss it with the technician. It is likely that they will give you a hard time about it, so you should be prepared for this and for any possible risks to yourself. It’s also possible that the MRI might demagnetize your magnet.""

bodymods,2u8xht,unemasculatable,2,Sat Jan 31 07:31:26 2015 UTC,"My sensitivity increased over the course of 2 years.  The more I practice with it, the better my experience. Part of it is the magnet wiggling in your finger, and part of it is the brain-mapping. Training your consciousness to perceive the wiggles for what they are.   Try to be very gentle on it, and agitate it as little as possible, for as long as possible. The theory is, it increases the scar tissue, like picking a scab. This leads to decreased sensitivity.  Never leave anything in contact with it for long periods of time. This causes the magnet to pull itself right through your skin in a slow migration.  Cheers."

bodymods,2u9vzq,Sapling666,1 point,Sat Jan 31 09:07:04 2015 UTC,"They put them in pretty deep, in between layers of fat/ tissue in your finger. It's about half way in between your skin and your bone of whatever finger you choose to get it implanted in. I guarantee that you wouldn't be wearing your finger down the magnet.  Also, they plant the magnet on the side of your finger from what I understand, so its not going to be just sitting on the tip of your finger."

I had 2s in for almost half a year (started stretching from 16g about 3.5 years ago, at 12mm now).   My suggestion would be to stay at a 2g for a while longer with heavier plugs - glass or stone. I spent about 4 months at a 2g, 5 months at 0g, and 6 months at 00g. After waiting so long, I lubed up, skipped 7/16"" completely, and went to 1/2"" with no pain :)   As far as what I use to lube my ears - my friend (1 3/4"" or 44mm) swears by cocoa butter. Uses it daily. I tried it and I liked it, but a few hours after applying it I'd get crusties and feel gross.   I found a product on Amazon called Lobe Lube - it's a thin, ChapStick like tube that has jojoba oil, vitamin E oil, and a whole bunch of other good stuff. I clean my ears daily and put that on them. I also used it to go from 00 to 1/2"" - totally pain free! The stuff smells a little funky (not gross, just odd) but other than that I love it. It's like, $2 a tube or something and lasts forever.   When in doubt, wait it out! It isn't worth the damage to your ears (I tried to force 0g, tore my ears, delayed stretching even more because I had to downsize to a 4g).   I hope you get where you want to go :)"

bodymods,2u60q9,notmydefault,22,Fri Jan 30 04:59:59 2015 UTC,"STOP taking your jewelry in and out!! Your piercing is almost certainly not healed, especially if it's behaving like that. I'd suggest you go right back to the beginning with your aftercare, and quit messing with it. It's most likely aggravating the piercing. Just the sea salt soaks, and leave your jewelry in for longer than 4 weeks this time."
bodymods,2u60q9,kungfubaby,8,Fri Jan 30 06:35:43 2015 UTC,Please stop taking your jewellery out and putting it back in again. You need to stop over cleaning it as well because that's probably irritating it even more. I'd honestly recommend taking the piercing out and letting your ear heal for three months. If you're following your piercers advice go to another piercer. If you had it done with a gun please seek a professional piercer. Maybe seek antibiotics as well. Properly mixed saline solution applied with an earbud and rinsed with water is the best thing for your ear right now. Twice a day max.
bodymods,2u60q9,sailorgloom,7,Fri Jan 30 07:41:24 2015 UTC,"If it is infected, taking the jewelry out would not be a good idea. It could cause the infection to become trapped and unable to drain. Going to a doctor would not be a bad idea, if not a doctor then definitely have a professional piercer take a look."

bodymods,2u46cx,satyresque,3,Thu Jan 29 19:58:41 2015 UTC,So the idea your piercer has in their head is that there is only ONE piece of jewelry as an option for you? Really?  Maybe find another piercer. There are options. Even putting a plug in for healing until that other piece can be easily placed in is possible.
bodymods,2u46cx,TallGary,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:56:18 2015 UTC,Sounds more like a piercer fail. Wait a couple weeks for healing and visit another professional.

I would suggest buying it from the piercer, that way you know it has been property sterilized before they put it in your fresh holes! Also a benefit of niobium is the price, I've found it to be a tiny bit cheaper than the titanium stuff my local APP shop sells (and waaay less expensive than gold)."

The only problem with niobium is that it cannot be used for things that have threads (labret studs, ball ends, barbells) because the metal can't tolerate the machining for the threads. It can be used for captive bead rings though, I have two black niobium CBRs in my helix piercings.   Have you ever worn implant grade titanium from Anatometal or Neometal?

bodymods,2u057c,audiocycle,3,Thu Jan 29 07:09:43 2015 UTC,"Sterling silver and 14k gold still both have a decent amount of nickel in them, that's what people generally are having a reaction to when it's metal. You need to find implant grade titanium, lowest amount of nickel possible available. Anatometal and Neometal are gonna be companies to look into. My body can't handle ""surgical steel"" that some shops like to use, I have to have titanium otherwise it gets all red and sore and won't heal."

On top of being less porous (and subject to holding bacteria) they also cause less friction against your skin compared to organic materials like bone, minerals, and horn, which I always found uncomfortable in freshly-stretched piercings."
bodymods,2tpqnr,volucrine,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:28:58 2015 UTC,Bone and horn could both lead to infection and/or your skin sticking to the jewellery if inserted in a fresh piercing. They are only recommended for fully healed piercings.

I could leave to house finally with out a spit cup and towel.

The small party tricks are pretty neat too, but being able to actually have another sense and feel magnetic fields is the main reason I wanted to do this. Can you imagine how much easier troubleshooting hardware is going to be when you can feel which wires are dead and which ones are live? A friend of mine a few cities over got one so once I found out that you do actually get a strong feeling from fields I had me hook me up with a connection to get it done. I'll start feeling fields in about a month, and I need to be extremely careful with not messing with any magnets or heavy materials until the wound heals up too.

You'd need a pretty high A/C current going through the wire to detect it with your finger.   I had my implant three months ago, and it's awesome - and I do have a sixth sense now, from rotating magnetics in electric motors such as desk fans etc. But not from mains wires in general.    I'd definitely have it again - the party tricks are certainly fun.  It's possible, depending on the victims knowledge of physics, to even double-bluff people with magic tricks. I lift UK five-pence pieces off the bar counter, saying ""Of course, being magnetic helps"". And having told them, they then don't believe me, and look for an alternative explanation. Great fun."

I've left it this way for about 15 years though. When I cut my wife's tongue she had no piercing, but I had to cut it three separate times to make it as deep as she wanted.. I don't think it really makes much difference if you have a piercing or not, if the person cutting your tongue knows what they are doing and you are realistic about what will heal."

My wife had problems with ""thrush"" (oral yeast infection) every time she got  her tongue cut. I know it wasn't just me because I cut her tongue three times and someone else who is reputable cut her tongue once, and all four times she had to get antibiotics. It's really not too bed to heal, unless you are one of the unlucky people."

Most women either get a vertical or horizontal hood piercing. A vertical good piercing will yield more sensation, but it depends on the aesthetic you are looking for. My best advice is to go to a reputable shop and discuss the procedure. I think you will likely end up with a vch, just make sure that the piercer places it fairly deep so it will actually do something."

It's not really an infection, just a natural part of the healing process. In the future instead of taking out the piercing in a fit of fear leave it in and clean it out. Every piercer I've spoken with says if you think it's infected don't take it out. It's much easier to clean something you can get to than something you can't. Now that your ears don't have something keeping them open they will probably close up and leave you either with totally closed holes, or very small ones.   Now I would suggest going to a piercer and asking them about your ears. Oh and when you are ready to start the gaging process again I would start with 18g because it's a smaller jump, or alternatively have them punched. But what do I know I'm just a stranger on the internet. :)"
bodymods,2s19bn,KJax1776,5,Sun Jan 11 06:31:42 2015 UTC,"have them punched? No need for that. Just take them both out, let them heal, and then go get them pierced at a 14. Unless you want to stretch higher, then get them pierced to a 10. But no need for punching just to start a stretching process."
bodymods,2s19bn,lement92,3,Sun Jan 11 06:41:55 2015 UTC,I didn't mean punch. I was trying to say getting them pierced at a higher gauge. Thanks for clarifying.

bodymods,2rxxvc,bigjimnm,1 point,Sun Jan 11 06:44:49 2015 UTC,Would you mind explaining your stretching process? It doesnt have tk be a lengthy answer but like what you used and how you started off from a normal ear piercing. Anything would be helpful! I really want to make sure I do everything perfect.
bodymods,2rxxvc,bigjimnm,1 point,Sun Jan 11 07:03:59 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I actually used acrylic plugs and tapers (some tend to frown upon this, but I've done it for 15 years with no problems). As soon as my ears healed, I would taper up to the next one. I made sure to clean my ears regularly (3-4 times daily) and made sure I cleaned the tapers and plugs before using them. Always use clean hands also. I paid a lot of attention to my body. It will tell you if it's too early to stretch. Some of the times I probably went a little too fast, but I absolutely despise the way small holes look on my body."

bodymods,2rtqt3,dark_ali,-1,Fri Jan 9 11:43:17 2015 UTC,"No experience with oral punching, just thought I'd offer my two cents. I've always heard that stretching philtrums was a pain in the ass. Not to mention the lip displacement that happens with stretching. If it were me, I'd just get it punched at a 4g.

bodymods,2rpsnq,IllicitIntentions,2,Thu Jan 8 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"When I asked my piercer when I would know, she told me that if I was using glass plugs I'd be ready when I could easily slide them out of the hole backwards (i.e. pushing the larger part of the earring through). That was a helpful metric for me, each time I sized up it was an absolute cakewalk."
bodymods,2rpsnq,TASTY_TASTY_WAFFLES,1 point,Thu Jan 8 17:36:53 2015 UTC,"Wait two months between each size until you get to 10g to 8g then wait 3 months each. When you get to 2g to 0g I would wait about 4 months between each stretch. Remember to never skip sizes! If it hurts, then that means your ears aren't ready yet. I made that mistake when I first started stretching. :P"
bodymods,2rpsnq,skapunkpirate,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:01:32 2015 UTC,"One MM = One Month. So for stretches like 5/8-3/4 you would  wait 3 months. If you can, invest in half sizes like 1g and 18/21/24mm. Use lubricant oils like Jojoba, emu, and Vitamin E daily after showers and when inserting jewelry. After 2-4 weeks sleep without plugs, but only after 0g. Once you reach 2g stop using tapers and tape, if you don't, YOU WILL HAVE BLOWOUTS."

bodymods,2ra3na,emkcj,4,Sun Jan 4 06:28:27 2015 UTC,"It depends on the degree of rejection. I had one in the center of my chest (where a necklace would lie), which started rejecting after about a year. I left it alone for a period, thinking it might just work its way out, but it just ended up tilting to the point that the base was very visible under the skin. I went in to my piercer and because it was already on its way out she just popped it out very carefully using a pair of tweezers/pliers, no incision needed. It hurt significantly less than having it put in and didn't really bleed at all."
bodymods,2ra3na,ilylollerskates,3,Sun Jan 4 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"I had mine (healthy) removed by the bodmod artist. He uses a hot compress for the skin to get loose and easier to move   (I assume), massages the skin. Then he uses a scalpel to make a small incision (cuts the, on my back thicker, scar tissue stringy things attached to the md foot) and is able to remove the md foot. Barely a scar."
bodymods,2ra3na,Fltkf,3,Sun Jan 4 08:04:04 2015 UTC,"I had one under each collarbone. One rejected so I got the other removed. The removal process worked and felt exactly like the implanting process. She used a hollow needle to cut the little flesh bits that grow through the holes in the anchor. Took about thirty seconds.  Also, if you're a dude, don't get microdermals on your clavicles. They ruin many, many sexual positions, and will eventually reject as a result. :("
bodymods,2ra3na,Stegosaurus5,3,Sun Jan 4 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"If they're already rejecting it shouldn't be too bad. Your piercer will probably either clamp the disk end or unthread it and thread a taper onto it for something to grab onto. Then the small end of the 'foot' is popped out, and the long end will either slide out if your skin hasn't grown well through the holes in the long foot, or they can take a scalpel or a needle and poke/cut the skin that's grown through it away. I found personally that already irritated/rejecting micros were less painful than the nicely planted in ones. My chest micros were a breeze to remove and were both not the happiest, had one about 1yr and the other about 6 months. Navel micros were through scar tissue so rather shitty, and my Christina micro was the shittiest by faaar as it was over 6 years old. My chest scars are about 1mm in diameter and probably 1mm deep, very small, considering.  Good luck with your removal!"
bodymods,2ra3na,rileyriot,2,Mon Jan 5 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"Argh mine was horrible, I just got sick of it catching on things so I got it removed, the dude held on to the piercing with *plyers then used a scalpel to cut the flesh then twisted the piercing to reveal the flesh it's attached too and just kept tugging and cutting, was pretty painful! Now have a huge scar that's like a dot. It literally looks like I have a clitoris on my chest. I never noticed that before. Damn."
bodymods,2ra3na,fortysixxandtwo,3,Sun Jan 4 17:49:18 2015 UTC,I think it mostly depends on how well your body takes to piercings. Regular surface piercings last only a few months for me.  Plus dermals can get caught on almost anything leading to rejection. Fuzzy sweaters+ chest dermals = ouch

bodymods,2r6dvm,zaneaj,4,Sat Jan 3 05:10:50 2015 UTC,"I had front/back tongue piercings, so I can only speak about that, but the one thing I had trouble with, is they were pierced too closely together, and the top (bigger) balls would hit against each other, and cause the piercings to lay crookedly. It was annoying.   Also, my tongue piercing, though it was in the place piercers normally pierce them, caused my gum to recede on the inside of my lower front teeth, so that's something to watch out for, as well."
bodymods,2r6dvm,Bewarethewulf,2,Sat Jan 3 06:01:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the warning! Do you know the typical size one would get for starter jewelry?
bodymods,2r6dvm,Bewarethewulf,1 point,Sat Jan 3 09:46:54 2015 UTC,"I think mine were 12, but possibly 10. The thing to be aware of is that generally, the top ball should be larger than the bottom, because otherwise, it might try to sink into your tongue."
bodymods,2r6dvm,SuchSquish,4,Sat Jan 3 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"I was told my mouth was too small for a double tongue piercing. The reason was for the bottom ball rubbing too much against gums, which I am glad my piercer told me. I would rather have one piercing and a healthy mouth to be frank."
bodymods,2r6dvm,SuchSquish,2,Sat Jan 3 08:18:18 2015 UTC,Oh no! I have a pretty small mouth so I hope that doesn't happen for me. Fingers crossed.
bodymods,2r6dvm,mrs2208,1 point,Sat Jan 3 09:44:27 2015 UTC,It depends on where your gum cleft is (I don't know what it is actually called). It also depends on how far you can stick your tongue out.
bodymods,2r6dvm,awildoat,4,Sun Jan 4 03:18:23 2015 UTC,I have front and back but I thought id comment because it sounds like you have never had a piercing in your tongue.  My advice would be to get your shopping done first.  You will need mouthwash because it gets disgusting in there if you dont and you really don't want an infection. Make sure its alcohol free. Also pain killers. Lots of pain killers.  Anti-inflammatories and zinc help too.  Only eat soft food for a few days. Besides the pain the extra work of chewing can make it swell again. Hot/warm drinks helped me too.  Warning. It will hurt like hell. It will swell and fill your mouth. Its worth it in the end though.  Also I had mine done separately which is always an option. I dont take pain very well so I thought it was a good option for me. Good luck.
bodymods,2r6dvm,mrs2208,2,Sat Jan 3 17:26:20 2015 UTC,Did you know you were going to get a second when you got your first done? I've been contemplating adding another but I'm not sure about placement.
bodymods,2r6dvm,BakerELMT,2,Sun Jan 4 00:18:43 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I had my first (normal spot) done about 5 years before the second.  I went and thr piercer had a look and said he could easily fit one behind because the first had worn away my tongue web. I got it pierced and haven't had any trouble with it. The only difference is that the one further back was a little more painful, took a little longer to heal and it was more swollen.  These are all normal for the one further back."
bodymods,2r6dvm,mrs2208,2,Sun Jan 4 02:49:23 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is the most helpful comment so far I think!
bodymods,2r6dvm,BakerELMT,1 point,Sun Jan 4 01:28:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't have this experience at all.  The first time I got my tongue pierced was awful, but I went to just an random place near my house.  After a month of awful responses I took the piercing out and a few years later had it repierced at an APP certified piercer.  I was eating normal foods within the hour.  I used the alcohol-free mouthwash recommended by my piercer every time something other than water entered my mouth, and I avoided drinks that weren't water for the first few days just for the sake of saving mouthwash.  I took ibuprofen before bed to help with any swelling at night, but only did so for a week or so.  Very little pain during the healing process, I only noticed pain when I was brushing my teeth and tried to brush my tongue to keep it clean (used a soft tooth brush separate from my regular brush with no tooth paste).  The biggest problem was that I couldn't roll my R's for about a week and a half and was terrified I wouldn't be able to again."
bodymods,2r6dvm,mrs2208,0,Sat Jan 10 08:28:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a different experience anytime they're pierced.  I just gave the common one.  Dont choose your piercer by who is APP certified. Pick them by reputation.  App certified means they paid a small amount, nothing else. It doesn't show that they're clean and it doesn't show what they're doing.  Reputation and their certificates (hygiene) are the best way to know.  Take a look around the shop too and talk to them about the piercing first,  a good piercer would be happy to explain everything and show you what you need to see."
bodymods,2r6dvm,BakerELMT,2,Sat Jan 10 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"It's not common for it to be that painful or make it impossible to eat solid food for days.  To be APP certified they have to meet certain criteria regarding cleanliness, method, and jewelry type."
bodymods,2r6dvm,TheBirdAbides,0,Sat Jan 10 21:10:42 2015 UTC,But they dont require proof and they dont come out to inspect anything.
bodymods,2r6dvm,BakerELMT,1 point,Sun Jan 11 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"The establishments can be reported and have their certification revoked.  Every piercer in their shop needs to go to approved classes and submit verification of attendance, and it must be done regularly to keep their certification.  Documents on the classes is considered ""proof"" of attendance.  In my field the governing board doesn't surprise me with visits either but if I am reported I'm investigated, and I am required to take classes and submit documentation on them.  Because of this, it keeps industry standard higher.  As much as you'd like to say it does absolutely nothing, you're wrong."
bodymods,2r6dvm,mrs2208,2,Sun Jan 11 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, even just being certified shows that the piercer cares about their reputation.  People that care about that sort of thing vs. people that don't are the people I'd rather have working on me.  So look for a piercer with APP certification and a good reputation, in my opinion."
bodymods,2r6dvm,BakerELMT,1 point,Sun Feb 22 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly this."
bodymods,2r6dvm,mrs2208,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:30:55 2015 UTC,That's not how it seems where I am (maybe im getting them confused with another). The only people ive seen who bother to pay places like this is the piercers who try to use their certificate to distract customers from noticing they don't have their required hygiene certificate.  They pay for these just because they know they cant get the proper hygiene certificates.
bodymods,2r6dvm,Fltkf,1 point,Mon Jan 12 15:52:22 2015 UTC,You can't be APP certified if you can't get the proper hygiene certificate.  Their standards are way above the norm.

bodymods,2r6dvm,watchfulprotector,2,Mon Jan 12 15:52:22 2015 UTC,I had them done on my split tongue. No problems at all except for the awful healing period. I didn't have gum problems or gum rubbing. It all depends on placement and your mouth and tongue. I got tired of them after a year so I removed them.

bodymods,2r57vy,AdrianDrake,27,Fri Jan 2 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"(Piercer here) That doesn't need to be cut out, it needs a competent piercer who can unscrew one disk, and safely remove it.

My tongue was numbed locally for the split but not all practitioners do this, and I didn't have anything done to my tongue prior. Ive heard mixed things about having a piercing to ""anchor"" the split - some say it helps prevent regrowth and some say the scar tissue just makes it more complex for the splitting.  I imagine it could only help with regrowth if it was exactly where the split will end"
bodymods,2qwbk8,zaneaj,3,Wed Dec 31 06:26:09 2014 UTC,you should consider opening the ring slightly to make the ring more of a U shape if you know what i mean. it would look much better also i would commit to black or SS
bodymods,2qwbk8,Eminetics,1 point,Fri Jan 2 01:54:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for that advice! This is my first horseshoe ring. I'll make sure to do that bc it would make it a lot easier to remove it/flip it up.

Definitely not the best way to split your tongue, but it does work! And I was hiding it from my family throughout the entire process, the lisp is a little annoying right after you put a new tie in. Lemme know if you have any other questions! I can post a picture of what it looks like now if you're interested. It's been about a year since I last split it, and it's definitely due for being split a third time lol."

bodymods,2qlhnd,audiocycle,2,Sun Dec 28 17:22:29 2014 UTC,I have my tongue split and already had to get it resplit once since it regrew a lot. I hope to get it resplit in 2015 a final time (well hopefully final time lol)
bodymods,2qlhnd,chickenfriedpossum,1 point,Sun Dec 28 20:26:46 2014 UTC,"From what I've read, the tongue tends to regrow a lot. The best approaches to avoid this are having a fully-healed large piercing at the base of your cut or suturing/cauterizing it. No matter what you do, however, a little regrowth is always to be expected."

I've read that the tongue is very likely to regrow (no matter how you cut it!), unless you had a fully healed, large tongue piercing.  Thanks for sharing your experience by the way. I'm not afraid of the pain and long time (I might give up, sure, but that shouldn't have bad side effects), and I think I'll go slower than you did (I believe I'd be ok at doing it in a timespan of 3 months, tying my tongue off very slowly, if this reduces the pain and uncomfortableness)."

bodymods,2q5hzc,slipitin,6,Tue Dec 23 22:46:27 2014 UTC,"I had surgery in 2000 to fix a severely deviated septum (and they removed a cyst that filled my sinus cavity and reconstructed the cavity). It was pretty major surgery and left me with significant scarring inside my nose. I have had my septum pierced for 4 years without any issues. In fact, I keep it flipped up 99% of the time. That being said, you really need consult your physician. While it may seem healed, the site is more than likely easily susceptible to infection. I would wait a significant amount of time to ensure that there are no issues with the incision site. It took me several years for the scars to smooth out to what they are now, which indicates to me that it was still healing. My septum used to have a large bump after the surgery and shrunk over the course of a few years. Once you have seen a physician, I would then see a reputable piercer who can check to see that your ""sweet spot"" is not compromised and a septum piercing is safely possible. Your piercer can help you pick out jewelry that will be able to be flipped up over any scarring that bumps out and stay up.   Hope this helps."

Reputable body piercers don´t recommend to pierce two piercings at once because it´s just easier for your body to heal one wound. The second reason I think that it´s not good idea is that the first wound can change the shape of your skin in the procces of healing and the second piercing could be ok in the moment when it´s pierced but not after it´s already healed. I also think there is not much space for going deeper with the second pierce - these two wounds could ""connect"" and there is bigger risk of infection of both of them. But I´m not professional, go and ask ;)"
bodymods,2pv39x,Icefalcon96,7,Sat Dec 20 05:57:20 2014 UTC,"1) No, using any kind of localized anesthetic is illegal in the USA for body mod artists for tax/insurance purposes.  Some artists may numb you with ice if you ask politely.  2) It fucking hurts.  On a scale of 1-10, about an 8, and healing it is a bitch especially if you use your hands a lot.  I have a very high threshold to pain, too, so my tolerance is through the roof and it still bothered the shit out of me.  3) Absolutely.  4) Depends on who you go to.  Traveling is the biggest cost; there are very few reputable implant artists.  I had mine done by Brian Decker when he happened to travel 4 hours away from me but he's usually in NYC.  I paid $150 for mine (plus tip).    Get a piercing first, that'll give you an idea of your pain tolerance.  Remember that this process uses a scalpel and involves cutting a pocket for the magnet to be shoved into, then shoving a suture needle into it, all without numbing injections.  It does hurt.  It's not like a standard piercing where you can just take it out and forget about it if you don't like it; once it's in, it's in unless you wanna slice your finger back open and squeeze it out like a marble through a toothpaste tube.  Think about it awhile longer.  I'm 23 and find it well worth it, but it's definitely not for everyone, and if you aren't sure about your pain tolerance it may not be feasible for you until it's more common and relatively painless."

Lastly, for reference, I put a small magnet in my finger on my own with no anesthetic (just ice for 30 minutes) with a scalpel and whatnot. This was before I knew Samppa was going on tour of the US.

bodymods,2pp2an,Adam-The-First,2,Thu Dec 18 16:46:58 2014 UTC,"I got a PA at 12g, stretched to 10g and then to 8g. I don't like the look of large gauge jewelry for my PA, so I got the idea of an apadravya that uses the existing PA as the exit hole. Ended up getting it, twice, at an angle to each other. See my other post for pictures."

bodymods,2pp2an,StuckAtWork,1 point,Thu Dec 18 22:01:33 2014 UTC,"I forgot to mention that I got pierced at 10g for my apadravyas.   All piercings were the intense. Definitely a lot deeper and more extensive damage than a PA, which is relatively thin and less vascular/sensitive.   I had a pain-gasm from each piercing; similar to a regular orgasm but with pain replacing pleasure. Very odd feeling, to say the least. Similar other reactions, like sweating, lethargy, inability to form thoughts, etc...  My feeling is do what you think looks best and what might enhance the experience for your partner, while still following safe piercing guidelines."

You're supposed to feel safe when you visit a doctor, not ridiculed and mocked when you're already in pain and feeling like shit. It's like a doctor mocking a young woman seeking treatment for something sexual and you can be sure that would start outrage - this was a personal decision of yours regarding your own body that harms no one else.

However, they're not necessary bad, so long as: - You don't force a taper in when your lobe isn't ready for it. No forcing ever. The problem with tapers is that it's so easy to damage your fistula. - You don't wear the tapers as jewelry. They're too long and heavy and will damage your earlobe. You must follow it immediately with quality jewelry, typically glass, surgical stainless steel, titanium, niobium, etc. Organics can only be worn if there's no tearing of the skin.  Best of luck!"

bodymods,2oyc4l,TreyN7,1 point,Thu Dec 11 19:26:24 2014 UTC,If you want to save some money you could opt for the kits without tapers. It's a large change in money which could be used to buy more sizes or to buy more inch plugs.
bodymods,2oyc4l,SenSidethink,-2,Sun Dec 14 22:41:18 2014 UTC,"I would definitly swap from tapers to expanders. They are easier to get in (because even with small steps, you can push them in 2/3rd first, before you go the full way) and if you use claw's you can even wear them till it stops hurting to move them, the ear isnt red anymore and after you can clean them for 2-3 days without any pain/stretching at all you can just follow up with the next size. Yes, people will tell you that you should not wear them for longer then a few hours when stretching, but if you feel comfortable with them; They do not harm the lobe, atleast not if don't play with them 24/7.  Just don't overdo it, when i help friends with stretching we mostly go for 1mm step's till 6mm, 2mm/step after that. Always stay on one step, till the ear isnt red anymore, moving the expander/claw/whatever doesn't hurt anymore and you can clean the lobe without producing any pain. If you try the next step and you feel like it's more pain then gain, put the last one in and wait a few days more.  Some people take month's from 3/64"" to 5/8"" for example, others do it in a single month or two, just don't get stressed about it. If you feel like you need a stop, grab yourself some 316L steel tunnels; You can leave those in for quite a while (beside cleaning) and the larger area on your hear helps to make the lobe look clean when healed alot.  The thing with taper's is, if you are a perfectionist they just wont bring you the result you want.  And before we go over to the ""omg noob dont stretch in less than a year"" comments; Yes, i can provide pic's of my 5/8"" that took me a month from freshly done 3/64"". It really heavily depends on your skin and if you overdo it or not."

bodymods,2opu3f,VinumSabbati,5,Tue Dec 9 05:31:03 2014 UTC,"I've found that stretching unfortunately has a hundred different opinions and experts and techniques, and that people in reputable trustworthy stores often give conflicting advice to online.

bodymods,2opu3f,willbradley,2,Tue Dec 9 17:49:20 2014 UTC,"This is what's kind of confusing to me. I have several cartilage piercings that I got pierced with my ""forever jewelry."" I realize that soft lobe tissue and cartilage is different, but if I can leave my rook jewelry in long-term while gently cleaning it just like this guy is doing to his lobes and lobe jewelry, what's the problem? His ears don't look irritated. It's not like they're festering and necrotic. I realize that orthodox lobe piercing care is take your plugs out/massage your lobes with oil daily, but in other soft tissue piercings (genital, nipple) the expectation isn't to take the jewelry out daily and clean jewelry and piercing. So the aggression of the general reaction to this poster seems unnecessary and childish to me."

bodymods,2omlk5,TheBostonLady,2,Mon Dec 8 07:25:10 2014 UTC,"I would stick with the warm salt water soaks and cleaning occasionally with very mild soap. There is such a thing as too much cleaning - salt and soap are both drying. Take care NOT to turn, bump, apply prolonged pressure, sleep on, rub against, bind tightly, etc. Also take great care when cleaning off the gunk - do it only in the shower or after a warm water soak. It seems kind of icky to leave the crusties there but picking them off can be very irritating. My navel took quite some time to fully heal so for several months I treated it VERY carefully.  How long have you been having trouble?"
bodymods,2omlk5,BlondeBibliophile,1 point,Mon Dec 8 16:46:47 2014 UTC,"Not terribly long, maybe 2 weeks?"
bodymods,2omlk5,BlondeBibliophile,1 point,Mon Dec 8 17:25:21 2014 UTC,"Hmm. Two weeks is kind of a long time to be doing salt water soaks and not noticing any improvement. Have things remained the same during that time? Do you have a lot of friction between it and your clothes? Do you sleep on your stomach? Have you been turning it or picking or doing something that might be irritating?  (Common sense disclaimer - I am not a dr or a pro hole puncher, just a knowledgable laymen. Nothing I say should be considered medical advice.)"
bodymods,2omlk5,J0HNN0,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:12:03 2014 UTC,"Sorry, let me rephrase.  The issue began about two weeks ago. I tried to just shower more to keep it clean but I realized that wasn't working so I started the salt soaks again. Unfortunately I was out of town for a wedding and didn't have access to my normal piercing care stuff (my nipples also got a little upset being away from home). There has been some improvement but not as much as I had hoped? Maybe I'm just impatient."
bodymods,2omlk5,J0HNN0,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:27:41 2014 UTC,I had mine get infected... It went into the fat layer and I was amazed at how big the cavity was. If you are getting a lot of puss then see your Dr immediately. If you are sure it is localized then keep a close eye on it for changes. Maybe see a pharmacist (chemist) if you cannot get to a Dr. Any Infection has the potential to turn life threatening within a very short time (2hrs) so treat it with the seriousness it deserves.
bodymods,2omlk5,Susurro88,1 point,Mon Dec 8 19:09:17 2014 UTC,Yikes! What indicated an infection for you?
bodymods,2omlk5,Kukimawnstar,1 point,Mon Dec 8 19:20:13 2014 UTC,It started being a bit inflamed and then some pus when squeezed. It didn't clear up so went to the Dr... The cavity (sideways under the skin was over a matchstick deep). Cleared up pretty quickly.

They made me so happy and absolutely gave me a different, deep sense of appreciation for my body. I'm normally not a flashy person (no pun intended) but I felt so ecstatic that I wanted to show them off as soon as I got them done! Definitely haven't had other mods like it."
bodymods,2ohmib,stephy23,2,Sun Dec 7 03:56:01 2014 UTC,I've had my piercings on my nipples for over a year and I love them! I completely agree with you they make me feel so beautiful :)
bodymods,2ohmib,flaming-mochi,2,Sun Dec 7 04:57:51 2014 UTC,"I actually plan on getting mine done soon! It's good to hear other people's stories. After finally being able to love my body, I think getting pierced will give me a bit of a confidence boost. :)"
bodymods,2ohmib,CatsandPotatoes,5,Sun Dec 7 20:55:18 2014 UTC,"I completely understand, and I think a lot of people with mods would agree as well. After all, you have to have some reason for doing it, right? ;)  Anyway, when I got my nostril pierced it was an extremely happy moment for me. It was something I had wanted for years and as soon as I got it done I couldn't believe how good I felt about myself. I've had it for almost six years now and I still love it just as much as ever and can't imagine ever taking it out.  As far as tips go, make stretching your ears a zen thing. Don't think about a specific goal size too much, instead just focus on your ears. Appreciate each step in the process and do not rush it! When I was gauging from 12 to 6 (my current and possibly permanent size, not too big, not too small) I took 6 months between each size up. This may have been excessive, but I've been complimented on the health of my ear piercings by several piercers who have worked with me, so I know it wasn't worthless to be so patient. It was a very peaceful process, and I got to admire my ears stretched to different sizes, and experimented with different kinds of jewelry to figure out what I liked.  My final tip is use good materials. Don't buy plastic earrings just 'cause they're cheap! Always get good 100% body safe materials and take care of them if they need it (especially bone and wood). Never, ever skimp on this, it doesn't matter if you're stretching up and ""you're only going to wear these cheap plugs for a little while"".  Anyway, glad you're feeling good about yourself! I've found my piercings have deepened my attachment to my body and its well-being significantly and hope you'll find the same."
bodymods,2ohmib,hellolion,1 point,Sat Dec 6 21:45:04 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I was thinking a month for the little stretches and two+ months for the big sizes. I'll be sure not to skip, and I'll be extra careful and gentle with my lobes. I've always wanted to get my nose pierced, have any thing you want to say about it? I get mixed views whenever I ask someone about theirs. ""Really painful"" to ""Barley felt it"". Honestly, what did you think?"
bodymods,2ohmib,hellolion,2,Sun Dec 7 00:20:10 2014 UTC,"I'll just say this about the timeframe you're considering for stretching, if you think you might, for any reason, ever want to try to go back down in size, double those times. Wait 2 months on the small stretches and 4 on the big. Even if you never do try to get your ears to go back to ""normal"" you will still have healthier ears for it.  I've gotten my ears pierced, nose pierced, eyebrow pierced (took it out), and my lip pierced (vertical labret also took it out after a few years). Of all of those, the lip was the most painful. The nostril was second. It wasn't incredibly painful, but it hurt. It was a brief pain though that quickly subsided. Healed really easy with proper care, got one minor infection towards the end of the healing process, took good care of it, went away, been a happy piercing ever since.  I'll say this too, the nostril hurts briefly while it's getting done, but really doesn't hurt at all after. This is a good thing. On the other hand, my eyebrow piercing didn't hurt at all, but hurt like a bitch afterwards for many months and was a continuous source of injury and pain. So, while the nostril piercing itself may hurt, it won't be so bad in the long term.  One final tip, if you do get your nose pierced, make sure and always keep jewelry in it until you've had it for a decent while (preferably a year and even then don't let it lapse for too long), because it WILL try to close up. If you have to take it out for a job or something, put a glass retainer in for goodness's sake. My girlfriend took hers out for a theatre performance maybe two and a half months after getting it done, couldn't find her retainer, forgot to put jewelry in after the performance, woke up the next morning and could barely even see the hole much less put jewelry through it. Similarly, I had to take mine out at work once and didn't put a retainer in, then had to force the jewelry through after six hours. THAT was painful, almost unbelievably so. The only reason I managed to get it through was because I was so fucking determined to keep the piercing. This was nine months after I'd gotten it done."
bodymods,2ohmib,cyronius,8,Sun Dec 7 00:31:57 2014 UTC,"I got my first piercing (a prince albert) on a bit of a whim, without putting too much thought in to it.  I though it would be kinda cool.  The moment I got it, I just fell in love with it though.  It was more than just ""kinda cool""; it made me feel great in general, and about my body specifically in ways I never predicted."
bodymods,2ohmib,MoonChaser22,2,Sat Dec 6 22:03:54 2014 UTC,"Exactly! When I got my little teeny tiny plugs, I was like ""Oh Cool!"" and now that I have them in, I just feel so beautiful. I feel a bit more unique, and they just generally make me feel frickin' awesome."
bodymods,2ohmib,r4ptor,2,Sun Dec 7 00:22:13 2014 UTC,"Once I got my lip pierced... and had stopped drooling uncontrollably, I felt amazing. I love it and have done ever since I got it.  One thing I've heard about stretching (can't remember the source) is to think about it more as putting in a tight piece of jewelry and waiting for it to loosen as opposed to stretching the hole. It's changed the way I think about stretching my ears and I've had much less problems with my left ear then when I stretched my right by just changing my frame of mind regarding it."

I got two dermal anchors and my nose done. I could feel my face reacting as if i was in the worst pain of my life while the punch was in my skin, but my brain was going too fast to register it. It was awesome. And when my daith healed was another one. It was such a bitch for 6 months. When it finally cleared up I was so happy. My body mods are my babies [Edit] as someone who has a lot of body image issues, I also noticed that having adornments makes me notice that I do look good.

My one big mistake was cooling the finger too much, basically gave myself frostbite. My finger tissue and feeling has come back 99%, but it is a little stiffer than my other fingers.   As far as sensation goes, I can't feel powerlines 50' above or a fan in the other room, but I can feel a microwave transformer from a few inches away, and can feel AC current in 110, 220, and higher voltage lines, through the insulation. Also can feel vibration from Wall-Wart Tranformers.   If I had to do it again, I'd probably not cool my finger so much, tourniquet after cooling, and make the incision from the top of my fingertip, instead of the side, which may have severed the end of the sensory nerves.   But seriously, this is a pretty heavy mod, deep incision, and large potential for infection. It is worth your money to know that as much as it can be, this procedure is done safely and correctly."

As a competent adult I maintain that if nothing else I am at least capable of evaluating the risks involved for myself and determining my own limits.  For example I would never attempt to do my own tattoo or scarification- I'm no artist, and even if I was I have no experience working on the medium of human skin.  However, some procedures are in fact quite simple for the informed layman to understand and reproduce with little relative risk.  I don't need anyone to protect me from myself, and I don't think downvoting good faith requests for information is productive if safety is really what you are concerned about."

bodymods,2nt0yv,serotoninlove,3,Sun Nov 30 01:25:44 2014 UTC,"Stop using tea tree oil; it can further irritate your piercing.  Instead of saltwater, try to find the sterile saline solution from your local drug store.  This is much cleaner and better for your piercings, especially because it's easy to get the ratio wrong on your own.  Other than that, possibly go to your piercer if you feel like you need a longer stud.  Do you know if the jewelry is high quality (neometal, anatometal, industrial strength) or not?  If not, that could be aggravating the piercing."
bodymods,2nt0yv,homesick66,3,Sun Nov 30 04:17:01 2014 UTC,Definitely stop using tea tree oil!
bodymods,2nt0yv,DuhStar,2,Sun Nov 30 11:42:07 2014 UTC,DON'T USE TEA TREE OIL.
bodymods,2nt0yv,curious-witch,3,Fri Dec 5 20:33:02 2014 UTC,"Hot soaking!  It's difficult to hot-soak your piercings too much.  I always say, when in doubt, hot soak! It always feels nice anyway :) If you've never done it before, I have found this process fairly easy:   Mix 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized salt to 1 cup clean warm water (distilled is best).  Have the water as hot as you can stand, but don't push it.   Sterile cotton make-up pads work very well for nose piercings.  However, if the jewelry is pronged, a folded paper towel is better (cutting the paper towel into pieces makes it a little easier too).  Wet the pad/paper towel in the warm solution, and hold it against the piercing until it cools and becomes less effective (also, though it is uncomfortable, wrapping the pad over and under the piercing into the nostril is most effective).  It is useful to have many pieces of paper towel or sterile pads at the ready, so one may repeatedly wet and replace the pads/paper towels on the piercing. It's best to do this for 5-10 minutes twice or three times a day.  I usually do it as many times as I can when a piercing becomes irritated.    P.S. Tea tree oil should definitely be used in moderation.  I have always been told that one can add a small drop of tea tree oil to 1 cup of saline, but to not do often.  It's an antibacterial, so over time it will make the skin raw.  [Fun fact: shot glasses work wonderfully for hot soaking surface or naval piercings!]"
bodymods,2nt0yv,CheezyMcWang,1 point,Thu Dec 4 05:07:43 2014 UTC,Thanks! I've noticed that the dishing has helped tremendously!
bodymods,2nt0yv,elime,5,Thu Dec 4 11:51:39 2014 UTC,"Keloiding is a very specific condition that causes excessive scar tissue growth on wounds. If you don't have a history of it, I strongly doubt that it's what you have there.  This kind of scarring usually happens due to irritation of the wound, such as it getting snagged like you mentioned. Keep it clean, cut out the tea tree (way too strong), and have the piercing checked up by a piercer to make sure the jewellery is still sitting in there properly."

bodymods,2mpsws,mente-creo,1 point,Wed Nov 19 09:11:38 2014 UTC,Does the app have any opinions on the leave it alone method? I got a cartilage piercing right before I moved and did not clean it (which for me personally is getting the crumbling crumbles off) so I had a thick shell of tissue and I feel like this piercing is healing better then all of my others.
bodymods,2mpsws,xoxoamy,2,Wed Nov 19 09:35:58 2014 UTC,"Many APP Members and reputable piercers suggest the Leave it Alone method for healing.   The only issue with it is that it requires lots of self discipline on the part of the client. You absolutely cannot touch, pick at, or allow anything to come into contact with your healing piercing.   Other common aftercare methods like sterile saline rinses and warm compresses are to deal with the unforeseen stresses that we introduce to our piercing. Harsh cosmetics, unneeded trauma, touching your piercing are all examples of these stresses. If you can avoid those in the first place then Leave it Alone aftercare may be for you."
bodymods,2mq2vk,emilyeverafter,5,Wed Nov 19 01:08:14 2014 UTC,"You could possibly put a straight barbell in, with a M&M shaped end on the inside. If the current setup has solved your embedding problems, I'd say you can keep it as is. If the new piercer thought that the curved barbells were dangerous in any way, they would have changed it out immediately. It might be unusual but I think it's safe."
bodymods,2mq2vk,mmikhailova,2,Wed Nov 19 07:54:07 2014 UTC,"You bring up an absolutely great point. Yes, I would definitely hope that if it thought they were dangerous, he would have gotten them out of there. Also I'm unfamiliar with M&M shaped ends, but I'll definitely take a look. My current setup has solved my embedding issues, but the barbells themselves are still too long and I have to be very careful when I chew."
bodymods,2mq2vk,xoxoamy,5,Thu Nov 20 19:04:58 2014 UTC,"I would hope if they were at risk for rejection or had any signs of being unhealthy, he would tell you straight up to change the jewelry or take them out altogether.  Depending on the age, I would be concerned about redness, soreness, or any bodily fluid leaking (lymph, blood, wet or dry crumblies after normal healing time)  I do highly recommend switching to the correct jewelry. They make flat disk backs large enough to not embed (I have one I can take a picture of tomorrow. Pm me if you want to see) and it should definitely be internally threaded for a few reasons. 1. Internally threaded jewelry is almost always higher quality metal. 2. Externally threaded is basically a cheese shredder.   Sorry for the long post, I just honestly wanted to share my experiences and knowledge. Let me know if you have any questions."
bodymods,2mq2vk,xoxoamy,1 point,Wed Nov 19 10:17:07 2014 UTC,"I am definitely learning a lot about the dangers of external threading now that I've gone to this new piercer. I think my local piercer only uses external threaded jewelry, which is a shame because she has some very pretty stuff I'd like to buy, but I'd prioritize quality and health over aesthetics any day. Thank you so much for all the information. I don't know if I'll go back to my local piercer. Even if she hasn't done anything dangerous with my dahlias, it seems like this new piercer is running a safer practice. He just requires hours of travel and has a wait-list, so it might be awhile before I get my jewelry changed again, which is alright by me.  I've had my dahlias pierced since May, so it's almost been a year. there's no redness or discharge, so I know there's no infection. I try to keep them as clean as I can when I eat messy foods and such. Still, the inside of my mouth was a little torn up. I guess that's because of the external threading. I'm so glad I know this stuff now, but it does make me disappointed about my current jewelry. I definitely want it changed to internally threaded barbells, but I have palsied hands and can't change anything myself, nor do I know anywhere local where I could buy internally threaded jewelry.  I can't use anything with a disc or a flatback because it will snag on my orthodontic retainer, but I'll look around for alternatives. Thank you so much for your advice."
bodymods,2mq2vk,A-Ok,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:13:55 2014 UTC,"Redness and soreness also indicate rejection. I don't know anyone personally with dahlias but it seems like a spot where that is possible.   You can get internally threaded bars so you can have a ball on the inside. Those start at 16g with plenty of jewel options. You should be able to go to any piercer who carries anatometal and neometalm   If you have anymore questions, let me know!"
bodymods,2mq2vk,StretchedEarsArePerf,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:52:29 2014 UTC,Its definitely an odd placement. And the original jewelry choice is obviously bad. I'd repost this in /r/legitpiercing and see if one of the more experienced piercers wants to weigh in on it
bodymods,2mom6u,JukeboxValkyrie,11,Tue Nov 18 17:51:04 2014 UTC,"Another one I hate is the idea that piercings and tattoos mean you are (or look) unprofessional. :(  My boss surprised me today by telling me he doesn't think tattoos and piercings have anything to do with professionalism. I know many people would disagree with him but it was so refreshing! I hope I'm actually one of the people pile-driving that stereotype into the ground (tattooed, pierced and very professional)."

bodymods,2mom6u,PorkedPork,4,Wed Nov 19 14:14:52 2014 UTC,"One of my favorite things to say when someone asks things like why would you do that to yourself/do you just want to look different is to ask why they wear rings/necklaces/bracelets/earrings. I just compare it to any other kind of jewelry.    ""For someone with piercings, you're very kind.""   I get that so much and it drives me insane. I'm very polite so I hear this a good bit and it always confuses me. I guess the people saying things like this just assume people with mods have to be hoodlums. Most of them probably have never really met people with modifications so they've gathered their opinions from movies/tv shows."
bodymods,2mom6u,unemasculatable,3,Tue Nov 18 20:46:55 2014 UTC,"Been thinking about this for a couple hours.  As always, it's classic mammal brain in-group-out-group stuff.   Someone earlier in their lives made it clear to them, their group (family unit, church, race, creed, etc) was certain ways, and was not certain ways.   Was nicer than ""other"" people. Had better morals. Worked harder. Etc etc.   As a mammal you are programmed to assume that other mammals-of-your-kind are good/nice/kind/safe. They are like you. They're part of your in-group.  The opposite is true for people not in your group. People in your out-group.  So some people unfortunately identify modded people as their out-group. ""I'm not modded. That person is. We're different in that way, we're likely different in others."" Perhaps they've had negative experiences with other modded people who they considered rude or gruff.  I can't lie, my brain works the same.  I had a series of negative interactions with separate people who were all members of the same religion. Judgement, rudeness, obnoxious questions, a lack of open mindedness. The stuff this thread is about. They were identifiable, intentionally by their choice of clothing, and religious ornamentation. My brain established a strong sense of ""out-group"" for people I identified as a member of this religion.  Yet occasionally, I would have a positive interaction with someone clearly a member of this specific out-group. Once in a while, I would have an open-minded, non-judgmental conversation, answer polite questions, make casual jokes, that kind of thing. My surprise at the juxtaposition between my expectations and the actual experience were always striking.  Explanation, not an excuse. The moral of the story is stay open-minded."

Never mind that I wanted snake bites since I was a freshman in high school, I must only do it to prove something to my younger siblings and her.  I'm just one big ugly disappointment now.  She just doesn't get it.  I feel so much more confident with my piercings, and when I look in the mirror I'm happier with what I see now than I ever have.  I'm an embarrassment since I came out as being pansexual and when I don't hide my septum and family is visiting or I'm at her house and she has friends over she is just absolutely mortified."

Loving, kind, normal parents won't treat you horribly just because of a change you've made to your appearance. I can connect with you on the pansexual aspect as well.

bodymods,2mom6u,PorkedPork,3,Wed Nov 19 02:41:28 2014 UTC,"Thanks.  It's hard and she just doesn't get it.  I definitely identify with a lot in that sub, but she's a lot better now than she used to be.  The biggest issue is when I try to teach my siblings any sort of life lesson and she gets all offended and tells me I'm not their mother, I hear that phrase sooo often.  Like chill, I'm trying to be their older sibling not take your place!  I have 9 years on my youngest sibling, I should be a role model and be able to teach her things.  The parents of the kids I nanny and babysit along with friends who have kids thank me for being so good with their kids and talk about how they like that their kids are seeing consistency from the adults in their lives.  Not my mom.  She thinks everything I do is just to get back at her.  Piercings and stretching have been around since before recorded time and there are tons of successful businesses built around the practice, but apparently I can only get them if I want to get back at her.  I got my ears pierced a second and third time before I hit middle school, clearly it's something I was drawn to from a young age.  I loved stick on tattoos as a kid, and the fact that I want a real one now is absolutely devastating to her.  She just doesn't get it and I don't know how to make her understand that she's only putting herself first.  She thinks that her opinion is the same as my facts, and that me using facts is me putting my opinion ahead of hers.  It's just so ridiculously frustrating.  She doesn't believe me when I told her even my siblings remember my childhood and seeing her treat me differently.  She has made changes but they don't last long.  She even admitted to always knowing I wasn't straight and spent my whole childhood trying to fix me because she didn't want me this way, and is convinced it's all in my head because my biological dad used to say he'd ""rather I became a lesbian than date a nigger"".  She doesn't seem to care how it hurts me, because she doesn't have to like it and refuses to learn about it or try to change.  I've tried going into that sub and honestly it's just depressing and too familiar from my childhood.  She really is better now, but I feel like it's only when she's ignoring what she hates about me."
bodymods,2mom6u,BakerELMT,2,Wed Nov 19 04:28:13 2014 UTC,"The sad part is nothing you can do will ever change her. She'd have to want to change herself to really make a difference, and narcissists don't see anything wrong with what they're doing so why would they ever want to change. The best thing you can do is be there for your siblings and show them unconditional love.   I can tell you now getting away from an N parent makes life vastly better. You sound like a great person and as soon as you get out and have some time away you'll start to see that you're nowhere near the horrible person your N has tricked you into thinking you are.   I know it doesn't mean much, but I'm sending you all the internet hugs right now. As someone that's gotten out I just want to say that it does get better."
bodymods,2mom6u,BakerELMT,1 point,Wed Nov 19 04:46:54 2014 UTC,"Thank you, that really does mean a lot.  She's good most of the time but just doesn't realize how hurtful she is.  She tried getting my (step) dad on her side about the pansexual thing and was annoyed when he told her she was wrong and I was right, and that he was ok with me any way I was.  That was really nice.  I have no desire to get away from her, but it just feels like she's 2 different people.  I wish I had more time with unconditional love mom and less time with judgmental opinions >/= facts mom.  Most of the time it's good, but when it's bad it's really bad.  She just doesn't see that my emotions and feelings are legitimate, to her I'm just one big drama queen."

My visible piercings are septum, two nose rings on my right nostril, snake bites, philtrum, and tongue. Depending on where I go I'll have people randomly ask me quite a few of the questions OP mentioned. It's basically a once to twice a month thing. I think another reason I get approached by these people is my clothing style tends to be a bit more girly, lots of dresses and skirts, so it kinda throws off their idea of what modified people should look like."

I've been waiting to see my regular doctor again and I think she'll be referring me to a rheumatologist when I see her again. I was just curious if anyone here had experience with it.   I experienced some slow healing with all my cartilage piercings, but part of that was because of the CBRs they pierced me with initially (they kept spinning/dragging crap through the holes, so I had someone else switch everything to titanium studs).

bodymods,2m99wg,ctrubicon,8,Fri Nov 14 05:04:35 2014 UTC,"I dig the 3 rings. Not common to see rings like that. Personally, I'd go for rings of a smaller diameter so they would hug the nose a bit, but that's me.  Do you still wear anything in your lobes or did you let them close?"
bodymods,2m99wg,BrendieBoy,2,Fri Nov 14 05:49:45 2014 UTC,I wouldn't mind ones with a smaller diameter-it's been a compromise between a larger gauge and diameter. Ideally I'd like to stretch and plug them some day.  My lobes are pretty sensitive so I don't wear much in the second holes and the first are like a permanent 14g (maybe?) so they just are ignored for now.
bodymods,2m99wg,BrendieBoy,2,Fri Nov 14 22:23:28 2014 UTC,"That's a neat idea. Small plugs would actually look great on you, I think. Just the nostrils? Or are you planning to stretch the septum as well?  As for the lobes, everybody's different, eh. The industrial bar is nice. In my opinion, I think an outer conch piercing with a captive bead ring would look snazzy. Have the ring hang at an angle parallel to the I-bar with the ball hanging just under the first one."

Seeing septum plugs isn't I can see on myself, but who knows I could be posting months later with a changed mind.  I do like your conch idea!!

bodymods,2m99wg,pizzaloser,2,Fri Nov 14 22:18:03 2014 UTC,Just put retainers in for interviews and ask them after you've been hired.
bodymods,2m99wg,Nerdybird92,2,Sun Nov 16 00:52:55 2014 UTC,"The nose rings can be swapped out for studs, the septum can be changed to a horseshoe so it can be flipped up. Most places won't even given an industrial a second glance.  It all depends on what you'd like to do mod-wise versus what your employment situation is. But if you're looking for work or looking for a better job an obvious facial piercing might not be the best idea. Something like a conch or tragus piercing would look nice with the industrial and its not something most employers would really even notice."
bodymods,2m99wg,khazar187,2,Fri Nov 14 14:33:25 2014 UTC,"Yay, three nose rings! I've got a really similar setup with my nose. I'm studying to be a social worker. As an amab, I don't know how nose rings and such will go down with some employers; but, the septum can always be flipped up and the nostrils plugged with clear glass. Also for nostrils, the people I've known with them don't always wear jewelry and they seem to stay open ok. These are old piercings (10 years), about 18g. Mine are 14g, but I should think after a year or so they will stay open even if they shrink a little.  If you want to stretch something, you could try your septum. It would be the easiest to hide and is a very slow process, so it probably won't be noticeable to others unless you get real big, which would take years."
bodymods,2m99wg,mandanasty,1 point,Sat Nov 15 00:51:45 2014 UTC,"Okay that's good to hear! I first had my nostrils done a little over a year ago and took them out for job interviews after around six months of having them. Those suckers closed up so fast I couldn't believe it!!  Someone else mentioned septum stretching I don't know why I haven't done it more. It was something I wanted to do and then all of a sudden the nostrils became my main priority.  Anyway, good luck on your social worker studies and hopefully we can both find a way to mix mods and jobs (ehuehuehuehue)"

bodymods,2m5af5,Zomwhee,6,Thu Nov 13 04:29:35 2014 UTC,"Sure thing!  <3  I arrived at Shaman Modifications at 11:45 am to see Brian Decker while he's in town. He and Pineapple were super friendly despite my lack of social skills and let me putter around staring in the jewelry cases while I waited for them to finish prepping for open - they didn't kick me out, thankfully; it was freezing.   At noon Brian walked me upstairs where he was temporarily set up. (He's quiet, but very kind, and seemed happy to answer questions, even personal ones. He even talked to me about what I wanted out of the implant and suggested I go with the slightly larger magnet, which I'm very grateful for!)  He had me sit on a low bench and spread out a sanitary sheet on the sterile chair in his cubicle, which I put my hand on palm-up. He cleaned my ring finger and then my middle and pinkie fingers as well, VERY thoroughly, and removed the magnet from a sterile baggie and cleaned that too.   I have a very high pain tolerance so I was interested and alert through the whole thing, but it was pretty gross and actually made my boyfriend feel sick. Brian made a small incision in the tip of my finger, inserted a tool which felt VERY odd and went MUCH deeper than I was expecting, and stretched the incision open. Once open, he popped the magnet in, pushed it nice and deep, and removed his tool. (Hah.)  The whole time this was happening, he was being very conscientious of how I was doing and feeling. Very professional and reassuring. Even if I'd been scared of the scalpel or overwhelmed by the pain, I'd have felt comfortable with him.   The last thing was the suture, which he did very quickly with a single stitch. After it was in, he gave it a critical look and said it looked like it might fall out too early. He asked me if I'd be able to handle a second stitch, which I agreed to, and a few moments later I was all set and excitedly watching him tap the suture needle against my finger - where it stuck!  I paid him through paypal (which was super convenient to me!) and he gave me very brief instructions on how to care for the suture, which he covered with a glove so I could ice it. I kept it covered for 24 hours. The bruising is pretty bad but overall the initial swelling is more annoying than painful. The sensations are already very cool, I can't wait to have it totally healed!    Altogether - 10/10. 5 stars. Wonderful (if ouchie) experience with Mr. Decker and I'd absolutely do it again."
bodymods,2m5af5,einani,2,Thu Nov 13 05:55:48 2014 UTC,How long is he in town for? And did you have to make an appointment beforehand or did you just walk in?

bodymods,2m5af5,Zomwhee,3,Thu Nov 13 15:12:49 2014 UTC,"I actually felt my last field last night when I used my electric toothbrush!  It is very hard to describe- how would you define the sense of smelling a strong scent, or the sensation of being too hot or cold?  The best I can do is that it's sort of a mix between vibration and a sense of cold motion. Sort of like a tiny whirlwind, which I can actually feel in my middle and pinky fingers as well.  It's very, very noticable and very satisfying in an indescribable way. It'll grow in sensitivity for a couple of months as it heals."

bodymods,2m5af5,OddKSM,3,Thu Nov 13 09:14:46 2014 UTC,"For me, the major benefit is the added sensory possibilities. The feeling of being able to sense things that were formerly completely invisible to me is incredibly satisfying.   For people whose careers are focused in electronics, such as PC repair, building, electricians, etc, there are a lot of further uses.  Being able to tell a live wire from a dead one simply by passing one's hand over it means a much lower risk of hurting oneself or screwing up whatever is being worked on."

bodymods,2m5af5,Ankah77,2,Thu Nov 13 19:29:24 2014 UTC,"Probably an 8/10. I won't lie, it is a nasty process, but it takes under 5 minutes and is easier to undergo than a root canal.

I just had no idea that you could even dent your septum that much. Is wearing larger jewelry more comfortable now? I'm at 4g and it gets sore from time to time.  Also, how did you do it?"
bodymods,2ltqgc,ProductiveThings,6,Mon Nov 10 07:32:52 2014 UTC,"Oh, alrighty then!   I usually wear a 15mm tunnel in.  The ring in the OP is way smaller than the hole. My cartilage end on the front of my nose at the halfway point so if I push on the tip it kinda flattens out like a clown nose, haha.  Took me over 3 years to get here, started using tape at about a 2g. Overall, not much pain if any at all. I took a fair few precautions to ease the stretch as much as possible.  I love my schnoz."
bodymods,2ltqgc,m00nr0ck,1 point,Mon Nov 10 07:41:08 2014 UTC,It's awesome man! I hope to one day have a nose this awesome.  Is that a Kaos tunnel or some other silicone?
bodymods,2ltqgc,CrammerFilter,3,Mon Nov 10 07:52:45 2014 UTC,I honestly can't remember the company that made it. I got it in a pair years back for my ears. I simply used some scissors to trim the flaring on the tunnel to make it comfy for wearing in my septum.   It's super comfy and it doesn't constantly remind me something is up my nose.
bodymods,2ltqgc,m00nr0ck,1 point,Mon Nov 10 07:57:55 2014 UTC,Damn I'm jealous.  I'm at an 8G and i've been here for over a year. My septum refuses to stretch up and I've tried absolutely everything.  Looks awesome man.
bodymods,2ltqgc,TotallyNot_MikeDirnt,2,Mon Nov 10 13:15:56 2014 UTC,"Personally, as the higher I got in sizes, I found that using PTFE tape was the easiest route by far. On top of using tape, I spent a good amount of time in a hot bath with a weighted ring in my septum to try and loosen up before inserting the larger jewelry. Even then, it took me a long time to move between the larger sizes."

bodymods,2lo8ly,ProductiveThings,3,Thu Nov 13 13:02:25 2014 UTC,"Congrats on the post OP. It's usually best to go in 1mm increments every few months. Ears naturally stretch without the use of tapers! It's pretty awesome really. But every few months (3 or so) you should be able to slip a single flare glass plug 1mm larger than your current size in your lobe -- no problem! Just use some Holey Butt'r or Jojoba oil as lube and you should be good to go!  This method is called 'dead stretching' which sounds horrible, but it's best for your ears!   Good luck OP!"

Has it ever caused any problems or made things more difficult?"
bodymods,2lgkzf,planrforrobert,3,Thu Nov 6 23:06:04 2014 UTC,"Day to day: the only thing I worry about is hitting it on something. Even then, it's going to take a serious blow to hurt the coating on the magnet (it's more of a weird feeling to feel the magnet press into my skin).   Day of- it was...uncomfortable. But totally tolerable. It was more annoying dealing with the stitch in the tip of my finger than anything.   The only thing it makes more difficult is making sure I don't smash it while high-fiving my friends. Really.   Healing was easy, no swelling/pain/discomfort."
bodymods,2lgkzf,unemasculatable,3,Fri Nov 7 01:10:42 2014 UTC,I always recommend people who are interested in getting a magnetic ring and wearing it for a few months.   It's really hard to feel magnetic fields flowing through wires unless there is a significant wattage.  It is very fun to feel where the magnets are in electronic devices.  Lmk if you have any other questions.
bodymods,2lgkzf,TIGit,2,Fri Nov 7 03:43:30 2014 UTC,"So I do a lot of mechanical work, and thought a magnetic implant might be really useful for dropped bolts and things in tight spaces. But during work my hands regularly get beaten, crushed, slammed, and whatever else and I don't,t know if having a magnet in my hand would exacerbate such an injury, ya know?"
bodymods,2lgkzf,unemasculatable,2,Thu Nov 13 21:10:56 2014 UTC,"Dropped bolts, not so much. Dropped tiny screws maybe.  Crushing the magnet is a very real concern, so for people who do get their fingers squished, an implant is probably a bad idea. A shattered magnet is more likely to break the silicone seal, and that puts you at risk for infection, or worse: toxic breakdown of the magnet into your blood.  Example: If you do mechanical work, and take your rings off to avoid degloving concerns... a magnetic implant is probably not for you.  I know a couple people who would want a magnet, but they just can't risk it because of the work they do with their hands.  I think Amal over at Dangerous Things is working on a new magnetic implant that might be better... smaller, some kind of metal coating, instead of silicone coating for stability, smaller, etc."

bodymods,2lcgsa,xoxoamy,0,Thu Nov 6 09:32:17 2014 UTC,I clean mine with Dettol when I shower. You can lather up the piercing and pass it through the wound in order to get the soap inside and remove the gunk.  I've never done sea salt soaks with any of my piercings and they all healed fine.

bodymods,2lcoks,snarfu,1 point,Wed Nov 5 09:14:09 2014 UTC,"Is it possible to have an allergy to sterling silver in my piercings but not external jewelry? Like my necklace and rings? I've worn those for years but never had a single reaction. An allergy to the new earrings was my first guess too, but it clashes with the other jewelry I own. But I guess it's definitely possible...  Thanks again for your help!"
bodymods,2lcoks,snarfu,1 point,Wed Nov 5 09:32:39 2014 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure, it may possibly react differently with the tissue inside the piercing which could be more sensitive than external skin."
bodymods,2lcoks,G_r_cade,1 point,Wed Nov 5 10:11:00 2014 UTC,"I had similar issues for years...  like 25 of them.  You probably have a nickel allergy or sensitivity.  Wear only surgical steel, titanium, glass or organics (bone, stone, horn, shell, etc).  No gold (especially white gold which has a higher nickel concentration), no sterling silver, no $5 mystery metal.  If it's not implant grade or contains 0% metal, keep it out of your body."
bodymods,2lcoks,G_r_cade,1 point,Wed Nov 5 10:28:27 2014 UTC,Oh man. 25? That's crazy. Are those piercings all healed now? How are they doing? And what metal do you wear for them?

Ice and anti-inflammatories should help, it'll be tender for a bit, but the swelling will go down as your body adapts. Try not to mess with it too much and just let it heal. You'll be fine!"
bodymods,2l8kqr,postscarcity,5,Tue Nov 4 06:22:38 2014 UTC,"Yes, a lot of swelling normal  Are the balls on either end of the jewelry pushing against your lip? If so, the jewelry is likely too short, which can cause problems."
bodymods,2l8kqr,SapientSlut,3,Tue Nov 4 08:29:25 2014 UTC,What kind of issues? I woke up this morning and the disk was kind if dug in
bodymods,2l8kqr,ferrets,5,Tue Nov 4 13:28:19 2014 UTC,It can become embedded. The skin inside my lip completely grew over the back of the piercing one night and I had to cut it out. It was super terrible

bodymods,2l2vuc,beeasaurusrex,2,Sun Nov 2 19:27:00 2014 UTC,"Yep. You don't want it to scab for at least 7/10 days...the longer it is open, the better the scar. This is the process, and yeah, it kind of hurts but that's how you get a nice, clean raised scar."
bodymods,2l2vuc,VeeQueue,1 point,Mon Nov 3 10:22:28 2014 UTC,Does it eventually hurt less when you leave it uncovered? I've tried several times now but only make it a few hours tops before I'm rolling on the floor in pain.
bodymods,2l2vuc,VeeQueue,1 point,Mon Nov 3 15:42:39 2014 UTC,"Keep it covered with plastic wrap - it will be itchy, but not unbearable...it shouldn't just be open. When it is actually time to scab, try and do it over the weekend and leave it uncovered (but gently wash occasionally)."
bodymods,2l2vuc,Jgarvin77,1 point,Mon Nov 3 15:54:53 2014 UTC,Mine does sort of look like your unwrapped picture.  I can basically just see the exposed skin underneath and it doesn't really attempt to make a scab or any sort of skin cover Ew  was yours still incredibly painful after ten days? Also what's the time frame between those two pictures?
bodymods,2l2vuc,Jgarvin77,1 point,Mon Nov 3 16:29:59 2014 UTC,I broke down and went to a doctor and he cultured it and said it was infected with Staph aureus.  After about five days of antibiotics it looks much better now! Progress  The thinner lines might not scar as much but Brian had told me that I shouldn't agitate it excessively.  I'm leaving it uncovered now and cleaning it with peroxide.
bodymods,2l2vuc,Jgarvin77,2,Sun Nov 2 19:42:46 2014 UTC,"all Brian said was ""it looks like a wet scab"", no aftercare? that doesn't sound like him, i know that the agitation leads to risen healing (which is usually the desired effect) but brands aren't normally agitated, which is why im at a loss for how to care for it, if they are integrated, its gonna make it difficult to heal perfect."
bodymods,2l2vuc,Jgarvin77,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:35:09 2014 UTC,I've emailed him twice now and gotten really dismissive responses each time so I gave up.  His aftercare instructions were to wash it or peroxide it and keep it covered if it was sticking to clothing.  Which was going wonderfully until I ruined the scab.

bodymods,2l0klu,Lighterlow,4,Sun Nov 2 00:18:18 2014 UTC,"sometimes its interest, but more often than not its confused old people thinking the whole ""kids these days"" spiel or just confusion/curiosity, which isn't bad but? its really annoying after a while.  & the bar is long, unfortunately. same with my labret. i've had to buy from shops rather than order anything custom & at a better scale because i could only get those online & i haven't had a bank account (so no debit card) in a while."

Just got really light-headed, and broke into a cold sweat. I had to lay back for a bit in the piercing chair to relax.  I had to be careful during early healing, though, to keep things (specially car seatbelts) from rubbing up against them. After a week or three they felt fine."

bodymods,2kw0li,RuYuDeShui,1 point,Sat Nov 1 13:07:28 2014 UTC,That happened with mine as well - one side was more tender than the other for a few weeks. A good sea salt soak daily helped fix it though!
bodymods,2kw0li,ReverendKen,2,Thu Nov 6 02:13:09 2014 UTC,The tenderness seems to be completely gone. I swear I forget it's even there except for when I'm cleaning it. I love this piercing though!

bodymods,2kmi8d,TheWildMiracle,4,Wed Oct 29 00:19:22 2014 UTC,"Well tattoos can mean something or they can just be something pretty. Same with piervings or amy other mod. They might or might not have a story. Personally I just feel more comfortable and confident and prettier with piercings. Makes me, me. Like a hair cut. A lot of people tend to keep the same hair cut. It can define them sometimes. Or clothing style. It's just how a person is. Some like piercings but not tattoos, or tats but not piercings. Some will do more extreme things and others have no taste for it. It's just a person to person thing. Or that's my take on it"
bodymods,2kmi8d,Romeo_horse_cock,3,Wed Oct 29 11:54:39 2014 UTC,"For me, body modification has been a journey. I started just because I was really interested in the aesthetic value. Stretching my ears and a few piercings here and there. Eventually, it became a much larger commitment. I started researching symbolic value in different cultures and fell in love with body modification because of this I continued stretching my ears and started getting tattoos. This actually led me to be disowned by most of my family, but experiencing this made me realize body mods are a way of loving yourself.  When you modify yourself you are taking charge of your own body, and reclaiming what is yours despite what others say or feel. It is a way you remind yourself that you are your own, and that you can be beautiful in your own way. For me it has helped me a lot in loving myself, and also realizing who are the people who really love me."

bodymods,2kj0w6,profelis,1 point,Tue Oct 28 13:41:02 2014 UTC,Ok that sounds like the problem. It should have been at least 16g.
bodymods,2kj0w6,CrammerFilter,1 point,Tue Oct 28 13:46:47 2014 UTC,Yeah I don't think I'll be going back to this piercer after this. It wasn't pierced very straight either which I know couldn't help the problem. I'll just take it out at start again. Really sucks. :/
bodymods,2kj0w6,Bloody_Insanity,2,Tue Oct 28 15:02:56 2014 UTC,It's just that 18g jewelry is a lot closer to a cheese slicer than 14. Really small gauge jewelry has the potential to slowly cut through your skin depending on the weight/how much you move it around.

bodymods,2k1ebo,fearlusbun,15,Wed Oct 22 22:26:36 2014 UTC,"OP, talk to a reputable piercer in your area. I personally know several people who have had their ears closed by piercers, but whether or not it can be done safely and legally varies by jurisdiction.   Do NOT try to do this at home. The earlobe gets very little bloodflow and infection or necrosis can be catastrophic in that area, leading to a trip to the emergency room and medically necessary surgery."
bodymods,2k1ebo,ReverandDave,1 point,Thu Oct 23 00:35:20 2014 UTC,"Holy shit, this a million times.  If you don't know, don't trust the web, trust your piercer.

As much as I trust them to put the holes in me, I don't have that trust going the other way.  I had to have a 78"" Labret closed, and I just went into my local hospital and told them it was causing me problems. I waited about an hour and a half and go taken to a room with a Dr who basically called me an idiot a few times (""you paid someone to do this to you??  that wasnt very smart"" etc .. ) but stitched it up in ~5-10 minutes.  piece of cake.  Alternatively, i've seen multiple people who wanted to get rid of their stretched lobes just cut their lobes off o.O but they were professionals working in the industry, wouldn't recommend doing that yourself.  You could perhaps pay a professional to do that for you though. Although I think it would look pretty silly.   I'm not sure what the [DELETED] comments were but i'm guessing there were along these lines >.<"

bodymods,2k1ebo,pinkvoltage,1 point,Sun Nov 23 07:00:17 2014 UTC,"Seeing as you don't have money, I suggest going to a dermatologist seeing as they're usually under your insurance. They'll probably do steroid injections they're usually covered and they'll help close it up. If you're in no rush jojoba oil might actually help because it helps break down the scar tissue which is what's preventing your ear from closing. Vitamin E oil is also a  very good option, you can get both of these at a GNC. Just massage your lobe gently with the oil a couple times a day."

bodymods,2k33of,flerps,1 point,Thu Oct 23 14:26:38 2014 UTC,i would replace the outer one with a smaller ring. there's nothing visibly wrong with the piercing job.. you're just using two of the same-sized rings for different sizes of flesh.

bodymods,2jurgp,_Nadir,3,Tue Oct 21 03:16:58 2014 UTC,"I actually have a magnet in my left ring finger. I had mine installed by Steve Haworth, who basically pioneered this kind of implant.  He recommended (and I agree) your non-dominant hand ring finger, at least for your first implant, as you're less likely to hit it on things while it's healing. In terms of sensitivity, and versatility in terms of both sensation and party trick, your fingers are the ideal place to have a magnet implanted. It's actually slightly off to the side, so it's not right on the tip of your finger, and mine has not yet interfered with anything I do on a daily basis (including small-scale computer hardware repairs, I actually use it to grab hard-to-reach screws!).  I'm very interested in getting more later in life (this is my only current body mod, no tattoos or piercings), particularly in other fingers, and on the back of my hand between thumb and index finger. This would allow me a much better three-dimensional sense of magnetic fields, which is hard to do with a single point of reference (think triangulating a signal with two+ towers to reference vs running around with a single sensor).  I've also considered my feet, though not sure where specifically. This would be just for awareness of things like subway power relay stations/similar.  In terms of jewelry mounting, you do have to have an external dermal, as extended suspension from a subdermal magnet will crush the flesh and eventually reject. Dave Hurban did a pretty cool proof of concept magnetic watch mount.  Edit: I've had my magnet for 3 years, no complication and no weakening in strength so far."
bodymods,2jurgp,Crackgnome,1 point,Tue Oct 21 04:49:12 2014 UTC,"That's awesome. I'd imagined that having multiple magnets would be problematic, at the least it will probably feel weird if you try to move two magnet fingers together- but I guess that's no more weird than the tug from every day metals/other magnets.  I'd probably be way more into this if I had a job where being able to sense fields like this was immediately practical. As is I can't think of anything more than parlor tricks and being able to tell people if a certain piece of tech was dead, or if the power went out. :b"
bodymods,2jurgp,Crackgnome,2,Fri Oct 24 20:15:33 2014 UTC,"Multiple magnets are fine as long as there is not a big risk of them contacting for long periods of time (like when sleeping). Steve actually does a couples implantation thing where you and your significant other each get a finger magnet and a magnet in the back of your hand, so your magnets click together when you're holding hands.  I work at a university, so I rarely find ""functional"" uses for my magnet, though it's still an extremely interesting new sense to have. Most of the time, currents are not strong enough to be felt unless I'm very close to them or they are extremely strong, but it's still fun to occasionally feel the tug of a magnetic field where you might not normally expect one. I also confuse and terrify new friends by suspending bottle caps from my finger, and I can always immediately tell if a material is ferrous just by touching it.  In short, don't expect super powers, but it's still a really fun extension of the standard human experience."

Sutures have to stay in 5-7 days while healing. Can't talk or eat solids in that time. First day your saliva glands will swell as well, so you'll drool non-stop. It's a pretty miserable week.  Taste is exactly the same. It can affect speech, but you learn to compensate pretty quickly.

bodymods,2jjjc3,worldunravel,0,Sat Oct 18 02:05:42 2014 UTC,"Heart:       The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system.  The blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as removing metabolic wastes.  The heart is located in the middle compartment of the mediastinum in the chest.   In humans, other mammals and birds the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right ventricles.   Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart.  Fish in contrast have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers.  Blood normally flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow.  The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium; myocardium; and endocardium.   The heart pumps blood through both circulatory systems. Blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cavae and then passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped through the pulmonary circulation, to the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide.  Normally with each heartbeat, the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs as the left ventricle pumps out into the body. Veins transport blood to the heart, while arteries transport blood away from the heart. Veins normally have lower pressures than arteries.   The heart contracts at a rate of roughly 72 beats per minute at rest.  Exercise temporarily increases this rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.

bodymods,2jkkax,Mortalitas,1 point,Sun Oct 19 10:14:36 2014 UTC,"Cartilage is unique. When it's just pierced through, not punched out and removed, cartilage will moved back into it's original position once the jewelry is removed. So don't worry at all. 16g is a good gauge for a conch. Go for it."

My guess is you moved faster than your body could up to 18 mm. also stay away from silicone for a month or so after a stretch, to me it feels like your ears compress the jewelery a little bit, so they keep on stretching with the tunnel trying to return to its normal shape. but that all happens way too fast. i took me 3 years to get to 1 inch for a time frame."

I used the argument with my mother, who has a breast augmentation and has had an eye lift and HATES my tattoos and piercings, but I never really reversed the logic on myself.

bodymods,2jh5pp,spiegelimspiegel,7,Fri Oct 17 03:12:26 2014 UTC,"As a transhumanist, I fully support your right to modify your body as you see fit. Cosmetic Surgery is totally a valid body mod.   OTOH, I think you look great, and have no need."
bodymods,2jh5pp,unemasculatable,3,Fri Oct 17 04:11:07 2014 UTC,"I'm going to have to agree with everyone else here and say I don't think you need to spend the money or time on plastic surgery. You're a handsome dude and nothing on your face stands out and makes me think that you could really benefit from any facial procedure. With that said, I know how it is to have everyone tell you that you look fine and great but still at the end of the day, the only approval you truly value is your own. So we either learn to love and accept ourselves (which can be easier said than done at times) or we look for possible ways to make changes.  Although I think your nose looks perfectly normal, if you are hellbent on getting a rhinoplasty, then there are a few things you should know before making the decision. Rhinoplastys are one of the more expensive plastic surgery procedures you can receive. According to RealSelf the average price for the procedure is $6,925. So you need to make sure that is in your budget and you're not going to put yourself in debt for a cosmetic procedure. The next thing you're going to want to do is a lot of research. Finding the right surgeon for you is vital. You will wan't a doctor who is board-certified and specializes in facial plastic surgery, and specifically rhinoplastys. When you find a handful of docs, check out their websites and most importantly, their before and after photos. Once you narrow the group down, start to set up consultations. This is when you will get a feel for each doctor and discover if you are on the same page as each other regarding the results you desire. The surgeon will let you know if you are a good candidate for either an open or closed technique and what your recovery time should look like. A couple of my friends have had the procedure, and from what they have told me, it can take up to a year (sometimes longer) for your nose to be 100% and completely settled with no signs of swelling. So if you do have the procedure, make sure to stay patient before you start making any critical judgments of your results.   Anyways, just thought I would share some of my knowledge on the procedure. Like I said, you don't have a crazy looking chin, or droopy eyes, or a even an odd shaped nose...so I don't think any of the changes you are looking to make are going to make some drastic difference in your appearance...but to each his own! Good luck to you and remember if you do go the PS route....do your homework and choose wisely."
bodymods,2jh5pp,Blue-Barracuda,4,Wed Oct 22 00:49:48 2014 UTC,"To be perfectly honest I think you are quite handsome and do not need any surgical procedures to become ""more attractive"". You mentioned rhinoplasty specifically, what part of your nose are you hoping to see a difference in?"
bodymods,2jh5pp,Carlisle12,3,Fri Oct 17 02:05:06 2014 UTC,I'd like it to be more symmetrical. I can tell when feel and see the way the cartilage is constructed that it isn't as smooth and slender as it could be. So my nose is wider especially when I smile. I think I'll put up a pic of me smiling when I find one to give you an idea of what I mean.

bodymods,2jh5pp,TheHybsil,4,Fri Oct 17 02:34:43 2014 UTC,"If you're smiling at someone, they are probably not paying attention to your nose. There's just so many details about people's faces that they look in the mirror and they hate, but most people aren't looking that closely.  Not saying you should or shouldn't, just giving you something to think about. If it would really make you feel better about yourself (which is really all that matters with this sort of thing), then go for it."
bodymods,2jh5pp,TheHybsil,3,Fri Oct 17 13:54:33 2014 UTC,"I see what you mean about it being slightly wider when you smile, but I still do not think it is unattractive. Everyone's nose does that. I'm sure to a certain extent it will still do that, even after rhinoplasty."

Nose wise i think you're quite well off, the only thing that could benefit you is i notice the tip slopes slightly downwards and if the soft tissue was straightened out i think it would be quite sharp."

That being said, if you personally want it, go for it. If it's something that bothers you and you have the means to change it and believe it will make you feel better about yourself, you should look into it more. (This paragraph could not be worded worse..)  I had a rhinoplasty about 2 years ago. All my life (even from as young as I have memories) I've hated my nose. My mom paid for it for me as a ""coming of age"" kind of thing. I wasn't in high school anymore, getting ready to start a new chapter of my life, that sort of thing. When they went in, they found that my septum was deviated, so insurance ended up covering it.

It's more of a general throbbing heavy pain for the first little bit as opposed to a sharp pain. They take a long time to heal properly (mine are still healing!). It's good that your getting it done with a stud instead of a ring. The ring doesn't heal properly. Good luck!!"
bodymods,2jfjsa,felix-xx,4,Thu Oct 16 17:19:57 2014 UTC,"I have a six gauge conch punch which feels great now, but definitely prepare yourself for a long healing period. It will likely get to a place where you think something is wrong with it, but keep up with clean hair, pillows, and a gentle cleaning procedure and you'll be fine. :) I didn't find mine especially painful, but the crunch sound was as loud as I'd been warned. Good luck!"
bodymods,2jfjsa,violet_crimes,3,Thu Oct 16 18:12:59 2014 UTC,"Idk what people are saying about it hurting bad. I only felt a small pinch for me. I have a 16g blue opal/titanium stud. I got both ears done. I have not had any problems with healing so far. They are a little sore if I touch them the wrong way, or if I wear over the ear headphones too long.   I would really recommend getting a piercing pillow if you are a side sleeper. There is a lady on etsy that sells good ones but any kind of pillow with a hole in the middle will do.  All I do to care for mine is take a shower every night and rinse them off really well (but don't touch them!)  Also if you wear glasses sometimes, bring them with you so the piercer can make sure they don't rub the back of the piercing (I wear glasses full time.)"

My boyfriend was there watching and he said he couldn't tell when the needle went in. It's possible my piercer just has a good technique or something, idk."
bodymods,2jfjsa,EphelantGurl,3,Thu Oct 16 18:21:57 2014 UTC,"I got both my conches done last week. Not really painful or bloody, pretty uneventful really. It's more of a pressure and throbbing vs. a ""prickly and sharp"" kind of feeling. Take ibuprofen after, and get a travel pillow and sleep with it around your neck so you don't roll over onto your side.  Also, if you intend on eventually putting a ring in, don't do it until it's DEFINITELY healed. That was my problem with my first conch piercing and why I had to take it out."

Pain wise, they smart pretty fucking good. It's so much cartilage, so it's a pretty audible piercing as well. If you have long hair make sure to keep your hair clean. Rinse your piercing well when you shower to ensure all shampoo/conditioner is gone.   All in all, though, I love 'em. And they're addicting."
bodymods,2jfjsa,Midnight_haze,2,Thu Oct 16 17:42:28 2014 UTC,It HURTS! And it will take forever to heal (mine needed a full year before it was completely painless and healed). But they are so pretty :3
bodymods,2jfjsa,Rocket_Ship,2,Thu Oct 16 17:54:53 2014 UTC,"I've had my inner conch done for about 8 years now. I don't honestly remember the pain, it was my 3rd and final cartilage piercing of that ear and of the day. I will say healing time was long, and don't rush things. Cartilage heals sloooooowly. Keep it clean, I just use warm soapy water and LITHA. Good luck, I'm sure you'll love it."
bodymods,2jfjsa,ShinyTinker,2,Thu Oct 16 18:11:03 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't even describe my conch piercing as painful. It was more just a shock with a blunt strong force, and didn't sting at all like my other helix piercings. Strangely i found this the same with my rook and anti-tragus, no stinging! I got it pierced with a ring which i really regret. It was fine to sleep on but the piercing clearly wasn't happy as it had a fleshy lump for quite a while. It's gone now but if it gets knocked the lump will reappear for a while.  It'll look great, good luck!"
bodymods,2jfjsa,ShinyTinker,2,Thu Oct 16 21:06:35 2014 UTC,"HURTS! (and takes a long time to heal) but worth it. I got my conch pierced twice in one session for an orbital, and it was most painful the next day, and took about a year to fully heal. Get some special pillows for sleeping with like these (http://www.oempromo.com/product/Pillows/N/Neck-Pillow-50-202477.htm). You will want to avoid pressure at all costs."
bodymods,2jfjsa,emkcj,1 point,Thu Oct 16 22:03:17 2014 UTC,"Got a 12g ring in mine last year. I heal well with piercings and this one STILL hurts more often than it doesn't. Not just daily, but if it gets bumped or something. I can count on one hand the days I could move it around without it hurting. You probably won't be able to sleep on that side without cupping your hand around your ear to keep it off the pillow. Worth it though, cause they look very pretty!!"

I have seen others bleed so much that the tattooist had to stop due to the ink not staying put, so everyone is different. I have a whole back piece so covering wasn't an option. I got my wife to cover it regularly with bepanthan cream and washed as usual. The needle wounds are small ( though many) and seal very fast, so unless you are in a high risk job or are unhygienic care should be minimal. Follow your tattooists advice though."
bodymods,2j60jp,JamesGoodall,11,Mon Oct 13 23:57:00 2014 UTC,"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say no. One, you'll need implant grade steel or titanium. Two, your dick isn't the same diameter flaccid and erect. The proper curve for you flaccid would end up digging into your erectile tissue when erect, and the proper curve when erect would poke against your skin potentially rejecting.  Silicone bars might work though. I no little about Subdermals so shape may play a factor, but that's what I'm guessing would be closest to what you want."

If it's metal and it's inside you, it's a rod or a plate and it's fixed to bone. Let me be more clear, abandon the idea of metal implants in your penis. It is a terrible idea, will not work, and anyone who agrees to do it is a hack."

My old boss still has one from Haworth in his hand.   Lots of people have titanium implants, and lots of people have them in genitals. F136 titanium as an implant will work just fine, but most people prefer something softer.   Realistically using a barbell isn't a great idea because of gaps and holes and etc. Someone could carve one from silicone if necessary."

bodymods,2j3h2o,mikesomething,6,Mon Oct 13 07:20:06 2014 UTC,"I got mine split about 2 months ago. When looking for someone to do it I was initially looking at Seattle and found a few people willing to do it so I don't think legality will be an issue. I lucked out and was able to catch Steve Haworth while he was traveling rather then during a visit to Seattle. The pain of the split isn't too bad and goes really fast. The actually time to do the split was about 15 to 30 seconds. It then took about 20 minutes to do the sutures, but Steve used a lot to make sure I got really good closure to minimize regrowth. I made a post about it here if you would like some more info about my initial healing process. Or feel free to message me/post any other questions you might have."

I did mine with a scalpel in 4 or 5 sessions over the course of maybe 7 weeks. Pain afterwards wasn't too bad, definitely manageable. I didn't use sutures so I'd occasionally get things stuck in the split while healing, most memorable being piece of rock salt. The cutting itself just felt like a papercut and it was much less painful than I thought it'd be, but still unsettling just because I knew it was my tongue and I had to keep it dead still."

bodymods,2j3h2o,Ecka6,1 point,Mon Nov 17 18:24:44 2014 UTC,"No idea about where, i live in the UK.   I got my tongue split 5 years ago. i did it myself with a scalpel and no sutures. at the time there was very little pain, i was hyped with so much adrenalin running through my system that i don't think i would of felt getting hit by a car much at the time. Healing was a different story, very sore with a dull ache that didn't go away for a week, that mixed with not being able to talk properly and real difficulty moving food around my moth when eating wasn't fun. Then after about a week the swelling dropped really quick and the soreness on the cut sections dissapeared almost over night. dont worry about the pain, it doesnt last long but a split tongue lasts a lifetime."
bodymods,2j3h2o,Ecka6,0,Sat Nov 8 14:38:39 2014 UTC,Eeek I'm getting my tongue split on the 26th of this month. Just booked my appointment last night!

bodymods,2j0x7c,swampdebutante,13,Sun Oct 12 13:35:15 2014 UTC,What made you decide to give up your big lobes?
bodymods,2j0x7c,rpgoof,6,Sun Oct 12 15:30:19 2014 UTC,"I can't really pinpoint an exact moment, but at some point I was just ""over"" having big lobes. I still love the aesthetic, I just love it on other people. I think a lot of it had to do with advancing in my career and being afraid that people wouldn't take me seriously. It might be an incorrect assumption since I'm covered in tattoos as well, but they aren't on my face and I think maybe that was the deciding factor. I kept my jewelry out for about a year while I decided what I was going to do. Just like stretching is not a decision to be made lightly, having them closed up is just as big of a decision."
bodymods,2j0x7c,kris623,7,Sun Oct 12 20:10:35 2014 UTC,"Why didn't you just have a heavy bod mod artist close your ears up?  I've seen way more good reversals from them than from any plastic surgeon, and it is waaay cheaper out of pocket."
bodymods,2j0x7c,hamhamt,6,Sun Oct 12 19:54:25 2014 UTC,"There is nobody in my area who could do it. I'd likely have asked the person who scalpeled them to close them up, but I don't live there anymore and it's a 12 hour round trip. The surgeon who did my ears had done similar surgeries before, so I felt pretty comfortable about it."
bodymods,2j0x7c,girrrrrrr2,5,Sun Oct 12 20:03:08 2014 UTC,"When I started stretching my lobes I began documenting my progress, so when I decided to have them closed up I documented that too. :)"

bodymods,2j0x7c,beverlycrushher,4,Sun Oct 12 18:53:57 2014 UTC,What /r/Eminetics said :) I had my lobes pierced with a gun when I was 12 so the placement was never ideal.

At some point I was just ""over it"". It's hard to articulate. I have a friend who is stretching and her 17 year old daughter is stretching too, so I gave them all my old jewelry -- I have no reason to assume that because I changed my mind that they will too. I hope that makes sense. :)"

So seriously, respect. :)  Also, I think it'd be interesting to see how the process is changed from a first piercing if you decide to re-pierce them. Just an odd thought I had, thus the question."

bodymods,2iytmr,TallGary,9,Sat Oct 11 19:18:29 2014 UTC,Would it be rude to ask how one manage to rip their ear up like that? In stretching now and you just got me paranoid.
bodymods,2iytmr,shufu,20,Sat Oct 11 20:41:27 2014 UTC,It got yanked hard by a person who right after got the ass kicking of a lifetime. Ears were perfectly healthy with no thin spots. It was just enough force to make a spiral tear and snapped in two.  Didn't feel a thing either. I saw my plug hit the ground and I thought it just popped out. Reached down to get it and a bloody skin flap hit my face. Reached up and felt the damage. Reacted (poorly).

bodymods,2iytmr,sirzack92,11,Sat Oct 11 23:16:01 2014 UTC,This may seem weird but a stretched lobe is just as much off limits as the ball area. Attack those and whatever the person returns to your face is deserved.
bodymods,2iytmr,trollocity,9,Sat Oct 11 23:30:57 2014 UTC,poorly   You mean you were nice enough not to cut his ears right off?

bodymods,2iytmr,I_SMASH_FRACTALS,12,Sun Oct 12 02:05:23 2014 UTC,"So I had it ripped violently. Two dangling, bleeding strips of serrated flesh. Went to the ER, and they did their best. Well, their best included way too many stitches in one area and it resulted in the tissue barely taking hold, and much of it losing blood flow and dying off. My ear looked terrible, and for the first time since high school I was super self conscious about the way I looked.  I had a few colleagues offer to help fix it, but most were either out of state, or just super busy. Then one day I got a call that Decker was in town and had a cancellation. So stoked!  Without getting into too much detail of his methods, I will say that the whole process took about 35 min. When I looked in the mirror when he was dine, I seriously almost cried. My ear looked 10,000 times better.   Before the rip, I was at 1 3/4. After the ER, I was at about 5/8ths, but barely connected. (Maybe 4mm of skin was holding it together) wearing jewelry wasn't an option. After Decker, I was at about a 4g. Since healing for about 7 weeks, I'm now able to wear jewelry. Last Sunday I put a 4g plug in. Super loose. So 2g goes in. Next morning that was falling out. 0G. Same thing, each day has been a size up. I'm currently at a loose 1/2 inch. I feel like 9/16ths is happening by the time I close shop tonight.  I'm by no means ""stretching"" right now. I'm just letting the weight of the jewelry do its thing. Not trying to cause any unneeded issues.   Brian said it's quite possible fir me to be able to get back up to a bigger size, but I'm not sure I'll ever be back to where I was. Ill take what I can get.  Hope this helped."

bodymods,2j06lh,selfobstructs,3,Sun Oct 12 04:54:33 2014 UTC,"If you've always had a hoop in it, especially if that's what you had in it when it was healing then the piercing itself has healed with a bit of a curve to it. When you upsized and put a straight bar in it you basically have irrirated the fuck out of it. I would go in and talk to a trusted piercer and see what they think. It might just need to be babies for a while until it calms down, or you may need to get it repierced and put a bar in it to heal if you want to wear studs in it."

bodymods,2imqyf,RivetheadGirl,5,Wed Oct 8 06:34:17 2014 UTC,"What are currently in and can be seen in the x-ray are larger, porous, titanium screws that require about 4 months of healing, to allow the bone to grow into the pores. The two smaller screws, the silver and gold-colored ones seen just outside my gum tissue, are screwed into the larger titanium screws, and prevent the holes from growing closed.  I have about a month and a half left of healing before I'll have the smaller screws taken out and permanent porcelain implants affixed."
bodymods,2imqyf,RivetheadGirl,5,Wed Oct 8 13:22:18 2014 UTC,"Ahh,  good to know.  I'm surprised though that your process takes so long.  My boyfriend and two teeth completely extracted and screws placed as well as porcelain teeth,  but his doctor only waited about 3 days before putting the caps on."
bodymods,2imqyf,PamPooveyIsTheTits,7,Wed Oct 8 13:35:41 2014 UTC,"From all the consultations I had before starting the procedures, I found it depends on the situation, the doctor, and the resources available.  I was fortunate because it was an accident and my insurances are covering it 100% between them. It's totaled over $20,000 so far. I'm also not shy about front missing teeth and could forego having a full set of teeth for a while if the result may end up stronger. However, I do have a partial I wear most of the day, which is basically like a braces retainer (without the wire in the front) that has two plastic teeth on it, and is almost indistinguishable from my real teeth.  My general dentist could have given me implants within the week of the accident, but my periodontist and prosthodontist both suggested I take the 8 month approach, if money and healing time weren't an issue, or maybe more precisely, if my highest priority was to give the implant the highest likelihood of becoming the strongest it could be. The slower approach has also been shown to have less complications. After the roots were extracted, I had cadaver bone grafted in the holes and the skin stitched up and allowed to heal for 4 months. The bone grafts preserve the ridge by allowing the growth of more bone, and provide denser bone to drill into. Then I had the holes drilled with a surgical guide made from a CT scan and 3D model of my jaw, to avoid hitting the maxillary nerve and to position the screws in the densest part of the bone."

bodymods,2iopl5,allons_ykaylee,7,Wed Oct 8 18:55:59 2014 UTC,"Acrylic is probably the most dangerous material to wear, and I along with every reputable piercer would recommend against it. I'll find a link to some elaboration on why this is.  Also, I would recommend against the use of tapers regardless of the material. They allow stretching well before the ear is ready, they generally have a steep gradient which can cause blowouts, and also if worn for long periods of time, due to the difference in weight on either side it can cause trauma to the lobe.  My advice would be to see consult an APP piercer (you can find one near you on the safe piercing website, a quick google search should bring it up) and for the beginning only stretch up when they recommend and with their recommended materials. They will most likely insert glass jewelry at 1/1.5mm increments with an insertion pin until you reach a size where the weight of the jewelry allows you to put the next size in without an insertion pin.  I stretched up to 32mm a few years ago using acrylic tapers, and my best friend has only recently started stretching by going into an APP shop and allowing them to take care of it. The quality of each method is easily visible in the quality of our ears - although mine are not too badly damaged, there are large blowouts and folds and they are generally not as good as I would like to be, compared to my friend who has absolutely perfect earlobes.  If I was to stretch again, I would stay very far away from acrylic tapers and I would recommend the same to anybody considering stretching. Although doing it safely does take longer and is slightly more expensive, it is the much better method to gain happy and healthy lobes.  I hope this information helps you make an informed decision :)  Why not acrylic body jewelry - http://brnskll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Why-not-acrylic-body-jewelry.jpg"
bodymods,2iopl5,peterlikescheese,12,Thu Oct 9 01:54:07 2014 UTC,Silicone tapers sounds like a bad idea. You're really supposed to stretch with steel or glass. I suppose the silicone tapers should be fine as long as you don't wear them as jewelry. Silicone is porous and harbors bacteria very well in fresh stretches.

When using the clamp, I can say that the clamp hurts more than the needle. When clamp slammed home my eyes were watering and I didn't notice the needle sliding through. But, it should be noted that everyone reacts differently. You may have a different experience. Healing was a breeze, I used warm soapy water from my shower and then I flipped up into my nose to keep it from getting tugged or touched. You may feel a little discomfort when kissing but it'll pass rather quickly. All in all I didn't have to change my routine all that much to accommodate for it."

It's even worse on the eyelids though once I've done my smoky eye, but I take about an hour to do my make up altogether because of how precise I am!

I'm at 18mm right now and it took me about 4 years.  really go slow on stretching as you don't want to blow out your lobes.  i stretched to fast in the beginning and got some problems. now i go up 2mm a time and wear the size for at least a year before i go bigger

It might also have to do with the fact that initially tattoos, and those with many tattoos were associated with crime and violence and aggressive behaviors, that has changed greatly but the stereotype about those with tattoos has not changed to reflect that. I personally have no problems talking with those who are heavily modded, and have found that people with lots of tattoos are often the best kinds of people."
bodymods,2ic1e6,Susurro88,3,Mon Oct 6 02:57:49 2014 UTC,"As /u/bigjimnm wrote, I think people are afraid of what they do not understand.   I have never been intimidated or anything similar when I have interracted with people that is more modified than myself. But as a ""heavily modified"" young (23 year old) male with a very non-common look for a small town (27000 people) I can see how some people look at me with very strange and almost shock-like expressions on their faces.   But when (mostly) older people actually talk with me they realize how nice of a person I am and I am not a criminal or maniac just because I have a more ""unique"" look compared to the vanilla people.  I have no problem discussing and talking about my choices of being modified with people that ask me out of curiousity.

People are afraid of what they don't understand. So, the best response is to always be friendly and polite and break stereotypes that people may have of the modded.

bodymods,2i64sw,7EyedManGoatOnACross,17,Fri Oct 3 07:26:16 2014 UTC,I think studs are typically recommended for initial healing as they're less likely to move around and cause irritation.  I guess it's up to you in the end and what you're prepared to deal with during healing.
bodymods,2i64sw,Meat_Related,5,Fri Oct 3 10:47:59 2014 UTC,"I have both a 'stud' and cbr in my nose (two piercing on my right nostril one above the other)  And healed both of them the way they look. Personally I liked the cbr/hoop because it was easier to clean the crusties the first week, unlike the flat back of my stud (such a pain in the ass!)  but besides that I believe that they healed around the same rate (given that these weren't as the same time and we're in fact 5 years apart).  Hope that helped!"
bodymods,2i64sw,SammRoxanne,4,Fri Oct 3 10:02:22 2014 UTC,"Most APP piercers will recommend piercing with a stud, and switching to a hoop after three months. This is both because piercing with a straight needle and then putting in curved jewelry causes immediate trauma to the surrounding cells, and also because it allows potentially harmful microbes to settle on the exposed sites on the hoop and be exposed to the piercing when it spins. Both of these factors can potentially make it tougher to heal, so I would definitely recommend doing it the way your piercer suggests to ensure a happy and healthy piercing.  I got a double nostril piercing at the beginning of the year and went with the studs even though I really wanted hoops, but when the three month mark came up I decided to leave the studs in and still have them in now. It will definitely depend on your preference but I would highly recommend initially wearing a stud, also because it can help you get used to hitting it when sleeping, changing clothes, putting on glasses, etc.  Hope this helps :)"

bodymods,2hwsm1,Elurophobic,3,Tue Sep 30 20:22:48 2014 UTC,I just got mine 3 weeks ago. My work doesn't allow piercings either so my piercer flipped it up for me and told me to leave it flipped up while it heals.
bodymods,2hwsm1,gtfokenny,3,Wed Oct 1 07:37:30 2014 UTC,See what kind of horseshoe they pierce with and make sure it can go over that little bump you have. I got mine done and was flipping it up and down but was really shitty because it was smaller than the hump. Otherwise I flip mine up for work since we aren't even allowed to have piercings (for guys) in the military.
bodymods,2hwsm1,rpgoof,2,Tue Sep 30 22:41:53 2014 UTC,I got mien and the piercer I went to doesn't pierce with a horseshoe so I have a slightly curved barbell (basically straight).  You can't see it at all unless I flip it down and then it barely sticks out.  I was able to do this after like a day or two.  Just tell them you have to hide it.
bodymods,2hwsm1,catwhisperertron,2,Thu Oct 9 01:13:10 2014 UTC,I had it flipped immediately after piercing. But it should be noted that the curve of the horseshoe (or captive bead) will influence the shape of the hole once it's healed. It may cause a little discomfort when flipping it down after having it up for a long time. And it risks the possibility of irritating the piercing further and prolonging the healing process.
bodymods,2hwsm1,gtfokenny,2,Thu Nov 20 22:09:13 2014 UTC,"try to get a septum retainer instead of a circular barbell, they're so much easier to flip up.  I was able to flip mine up (without ANY discomfort) after like a week or so, just until the swelling went down.  A septum retainer is the best bet since it just goes straight down and doesn't curve out."
bodymods,2hwsm1,catwhisperertron,3,Tue Sep 30 22:08:35 2014 UTC,"Septum retainers are really nice, but I've found in my experience they fall out in my sleep sometimes. My piercer wouldn't let me use it as the initial piercing jewelry either because it was so small."
bodymods,2hwsm1,kjh206,2,Wed Oct 1 05:27:09 2014 UTC,I disagree with this. Septum retainers fall out very easily because they don't have the balls on the end to hold em in. Not awesome for a healing piercing.
bodymods,2hwsm1,0-90195,1 point,Wed Oct 1 05:56:16 2014 UTC,What gauge did you get your septums pierced at?  Maybe it's because mine was pierced at a 12g?  My septum retainer's only fallen out because of a nice hot shower and me accidentally hitting my septum while drying off.

bodymods,2hw45i,little_beer,2,Tue Sep 30 14:28:13 2014 UTC,In my experience (vertical labret for 7 years) that all sounds pretty normal. As long as the swelling isn't causing your lip to envelope or push on the jewelry you should be fine. Keep up with the soaks and don't mess with it too much.

I plan on stretching as far as I can for my lobes, however I don't have big lobes in the first place so I'd be surprised if I'll even be able to reach 0 or 00, nevertheless it's just something to keep in mind.

bodymods,2hazbh,diabolicbutterfly,1 point,Wed Sep 24 19:40:14 2014 UTC,"Looks like an irritation as you describe you pissed it off.  Sometimes can take awhile for the bump to appear and form.  Go to a legit reputable piercer, but in the mean time sterile saline soaks at least daily.  Watch for additional signs of rejection (which it doesn't look like at the moment).  Even if it is beginning thep rocess of rejection, the saline soaks can help heal it and save the piercing.    But definitely talk to a reputable APP piercer as soon as possible, in the meantime Sterile saline (don't make it yourself, don't boil water, go to the store, ask the pharmacist where you can get sterile saline).  Most drugs stores carry some sort of wound wash that works just fine.    Keep it clean, irritant free, don't move it, tug on it, rotate it, push it, pull it.  Just soak clean gauze in sterile saline, make it soaking wet, press it on the piercing like a gentle compress for up to 5 minutes daily.  If you leave it alone other than saline soaks it should in theory recover just fine."

bodymods,2ha0k5,graaaace,3,Tue Sep 23 23:30:19 2014 UTC,"Barbells def work better for active anything.  Have had not so fun times with captive beads when changing garments and not really paying attention.  Sports bras or snug fitting clothes when you sleep can prevent unintentional shifting.  As far as healing and avoiding migration I'm going to repeat what a very experienced piercer told me as word for word as I remember:   Leave your piercing alone.  Skin heals in layers.  Imagine a wet paper towel as the newest layer of skin.  Now when you twist your jewelry to ""clean"" your piercing you are tearing up the fragile new layer of skin and increasing healing time.  Oxygen and water are key to healing.  One drop of dial liquid soap (non-scented and not antibacterial) in a dixie cup applied with a Q-tip should do.  Crusties around openings of piercing can and should be removed.  After that it's just lots of water.  Let water run over piercing for as long as possible while in the shower.   Cringe Warning  I had my nipple split all the way across my areola when I was younger and had decent scar tissue from eight stitches that followed.  Piercing through scar tissue 10 years after that happened was kinda painful, fyi.  But now another ten years later and you can barely tell I have a ""Frankenipple"" unless I point it out.  In my experience all my scars from when I was a kid are super faded and not noticeable to the touch."

While I didn't do skin divers, I did do microdermals and I think that is similar enough to scar similarly. After two years with two of them on my neck, they decided to reject. Your face will experience similar abuse as a neck, what with putting on/taking off clothes, washing your face, possibly brushing your hair, etc. So while I'm not a professional, I can imagine that placement on your face will have certain risks much like my neck did.  With that in mind, here is what my scars look like almost two years after they rejected. Sorry for the potato quality; I did the best that I could getting a picture considering its on my neck, but I have no one to help right now. If I can get someone to do it later, I'll post a better picture. As you can see, they kind of look like white-headed pimples, are quite raised from the rest of the skin, and they do sometimes get a bit red just if I touch them. And this is after two whole years.

bodymods,2gv83r,carlarae,7,Fri Sep 19 15:17:44 2014 UTC,"First, depending on your field of work, you may be worrying for nothing. My ears are stretched to over 2 1/2 inches (65+ mm), and I've been over an inch since 2006. I too was worried about how it would affect my career: I'm an engineer, and work as a senior developer at a software company. Since my ears have been over an inch, I've given dozens of presentations at conferences, seminars, been to numerous job interviews (with many offers), and my career is doing just fine. Yes, I run into some people who assume that I'm a musician, tattoo artist, body piercer, or mechanic, and that doesn't bother me at all, since I highly respect people in those fields. At least I'm not mistaken for a lawyer.  I also co-own a successful business, and my customers certainly don't seem to care about my ears and other mods.  That said, it is possible to pull your earlobe up behind your ear and pin it with a conch piercing, which would lessen the visual impact of large stretched earlobes. However, I would think that it would still be obvious that your earlobe is ""weird"", and that you're self conscious of them and trying to hide it. That would imply that you're lacking confidence and somehow ashamed of your appearance, which would be a red flag for me (as one who frequently interviews potential employees). Also, would you wear them pinned up the entire time you're working? I imagine that would be uncomfortable.  You're already at 3/4 inch, which is still quite obvious, and it's unlikely that anybody would have more issues with them at an inch.  Best of luck!"
bodymods,2gv83r,bigjimnm,2,Fri Sep 19 21:48:04 2014 UTC,"Second: pulling your lobes over your ears is a good way to make it less obvious.  One of my friends does this for his family's gatherings (his lobes are two inches).  I'm actually the main receptionist at a community college and attribute part of my getting hired do to my dreads and 1"" lobes.  I think I had an approachable look they wanted.  That being said, oh hell yeah its going to limit you on jobs, but so does having a beard or different core beliefs or political agenda.  While I try not to wrap up too much of my identity with my physical appearance it can be a time saver identifying bigots before you invest any time or (emotional) energy into them."
bodymods,2gv83r,sethery777,3,Wed Sep 24 10:57:12 2014 UTC,I personally think it would look more unprofessional and weird for them to be pinned back like that unless you've got long hair that will hide the fact that they're pinned back.
bodymods,2gv83r,Susurro88,2,Fri Sep 19 22:11:58 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the replies. I was really just curious of how it works and if it's possible. I do have hair that would hide it. I will always have a customer service and/or health care related job and I don't see it as much there. tattoos, maybe, but I never see large gauge ears. even 3/4"" with flesh toned plugs get stared at. I was just trying to mostly eliminate the fact I have them at all, solely for the workplace. I don't know if I'd want to go as big for them to stretch around my whole ear though..."

You might not need these tips but just in case :) 1 . Having a larger gauge conch is a benefit when doing something like this, just so that the chance of migration is smaller. 2 . Having larger lobes than needed, meaning tht the lobes shouldn't be very tight on the conch jewellery, for the se reason as number 1  Please tell me how it goes since i would love to know if this really is as viable as it has been made out ! :)"

I have a small cbr, and while it has left a small indentation on my gums, it hasn't done any real damage to my mouth according to my dentist. The indentation goes away if I take the jewelry out too. I've had my smiley for about 6 years I think. No migration at all.   Make sure you brush the jewelry when you brush your teeth so plaque doesn't build up on it, and you should be fine. They aren't really hard to take care of.   My smiley is only slightly off center, but the only way to see it is to flip my lip up and really investigate. You wouldn't be able to tell with any jewelry I choose unless I showed you. You'll figure out your own preferences with jewelry.  For me, horseshoes are annoying because they never stay centered.

Do I do this when it's still healing or should I wait until it's healed? Would it get irritated as a fresh piercing?   I'm cleaning it right now by brushing my teeth 3x a day, rinsing with alcohol free listerine 3x a day, and following with a saline solution spray."

bodymods,2g9p7c,StinkybuttMcPoopface,9,Sat Sep 13 05:49:47 2014 UTC,"Dental lab technician checking in.   Actually moving your teeth to achieve your desired result really isn't an option as you're basically asking for custom orthodontics...something that doesn't exist (at least in this regard). What I would recommend is to talk to your dentist about having crowns made on your teeth to achieve the look you are after. Your dentist would be able to prep your current teeth down to accept porcelain or zirconia crowns that could be made for aesthetic you'd want. These crowns would be able to be contoured to not only give you the look you want but allow for better interdigitation (better bite, but I love saying that word heh).    Crowns would be relatively inexpensive (compared to trying to work through elective ortho) and easy to maintain long term. And if you decide you want a different look, you can have new crowns made.   Hope that helps"
bodymods,2g9p7c,planrforrobert,5,Sat Sep 13 15:08:53 2014 UTC,Ohhh this is a really clever idea! I'll have to poke around and see if I can find someone willing to do this. Thanks!

Went back just the other day for a cleaning and to talk about the next steps and we found it that he has abruptly moved out of the state. Asked the new dentist what he thought and he shot me down pretty hard.

The healing process is crazy long, but all-in-all, it was worth it.  I really enjoy mine. Just make sure you clean it scrupulously, more so than other piercings maybe, because it bleeds a lot and gets pretty crusty with dried blood. I actually wanted a zero, but my guy said my conch isn't big enough, so I opted to get a 2g ""fake zero"" plug."

bodymods,2g9ynt,Azrael_The_Bold,1 point,Sat Sep 13 21:49:22 2014 UTC,"Take some pictures and we can better assess the situation. When you have a thinning earlobe, you risk the chance of losing blood circulation to the lobe, which will cause it to rot. For some reason, I don't think you want that to happen, lol. I would highly recommend discontinuing stretching any further. You may even want to consider downsizing a size and letting the lobe heal."

There's no redness or swelling, which is a tell-tale sign of infection. If it is a recent stretch, just give it some time to heal. It's only natural for a little irritability after a new stretch, and the higher guage you stretch to, the more irritable it may be and longer for it to heal."

bodymods,2g9ynt,Eminetics,2,Mon Sep 15 17:45:51 2014 UTC,"Your lobe may be thinning in one particular spot because of where it was pierced. It may have looked perfectly center to begin with but the larger you stretch the more noticable it will get. I've been stretching for 10 years now, all I can say is, don't worry too much about it. When I take my plugs out and feel the lobes they're thinner in places. The back/outside of your lobe is also generally the thinner side, but yours look nice and thick, so I doubt you'll run into any issues any time soon, if ever. If you want them to thicken relaxing them helps immensely. Leave your jewelry out for as long as you can and massage some jojoba on those lobes. I wouldn't recommend doing this while stretching. Also, if you don't want your ear to wear thin in a specific place don't use weights. Or don't use them often, and make sure they're fairly light. Hope that helps c: Happy stretching!"

Body modifications are an important part of my identity and I feel like peoples' motivations for having or liking them are often misinterpreted. My appearance has changed a lot over the years, from haircuts to weight gain and loss to my tattoos and piercings. If I had any choice in these changes to my appearance, I would always choose to make my external self appear more as my internal self thought I should look. It's transformations like these that embody what this community and this practice are about. Body modification to me is the physical manifestation of the gift of self realization. What could be better than obtaining an outward appearance that you feel reflects your soul more accurately? OP has a great look. I hope he knows it."

bodymods,2g293v,ragingbearsex,1 point,Thu Sep 11 02:10:58 2014 UTC,Thanks for the feedback :) it's a bit disheartening that in your experience your tongue didn't lengthen. That is one of the main reasons I'm getting the procedure done. It's not the only reason obviously so I'll most likely go through with getting it done. But thanks for the input. Do you mind telling me more about the exercises your dentist made you do after the procedure. Is it possible you didn't do them as long as you were supposed to and that's why it's not longer? Not judging just curious.

Not exercises prescribed, but I was constantly sticking my tongue out and up, or folding it into the back of my throat because the new range of motion was great. I'm not sure if my lack of regular exercise would've contributed, but I know that I don't have any restricting scar tissue after the procedure, so I think my tongue is just naturally short."

I don't have a lip piercing so I can't give you advice about that one, but I think either piercing would suit you!"

I haven't seen anyone who couldn't pull off a septum yet and they are the easiest facial piercing to hide. Just make sure if you get one and tuck it up to avoid classmates being jerks you keep it flipped up during the healing period. In the interest of full disclosure they are a bit more difficult to get perfectly straight, so make sure your piercer knows their stuff.  Lip piercings do look good, too, just not as good (again, my opinion only), and even well placed and with properly fitting jewelry they still carry a potential for tooth and gum damage."

It can be hard having older generations understand something that is new and upcoming with our generation, and sometimes it takes more education and explaining with heavy topics than others. The main gist of body mods in our culture are that they are a means of adorning oneself. You as a young adult are figuring out your way in life and finally have control of your body. You are also capable of making your own decisions. Not only that, but a piercing can be a temporary mod when compared to a tattoo or scarification. Just alert them that your new piercing doesn't alter who are as a person and you love them just the same, and explain your reasons for the piercing, as well as the role of body modification in today's society. Like I said, this is a topic that would take a while for them to understand. The more they see your piercing, the more likely they are to be familiarized with it. This will take time, but they have bigger and better things to be concerned about. Good luck!"

I would just explain that you're doing it for yourself, if someone is going to judge you for wearing jewelry in your body and they freak out about it, they're not worth your time, they will come around and if they don't losing them in your  life isn't a loss.  I would try and sit your mom down and explain that it's not like you are doing it to make people mad, you're doing it to make you happy.  I've been modified for the past 15 years, initially my mom and dad hated the idea, slowly they realized that it made me happy and just because I chose to look different it didn't change who i am or the way I act.   Don't take what she is saying and how she is acting as her ""being a bitch""  odds are she is just worried that you might be viewed badly by the rest of society and might have a hard go in the professional world ect.   It will take a bit of time, just explain your reasons in a calm collected manner, either she will slowly come around or your words will fall in deaf ears, I hope it's the latter.   My father lost it when I got my tongue split despite me talking about it for 7 years before I actually got it done, I came home after getting it, he asked to see it and lost his mind, yelling and screaming that I had closed all professional doors for myself ect ect.   an hour later he came into my room and told me he loved me regardless of what I chose to do with my body and regardless of what I did with my life as long as it made me happy.   Body modification isn't going anywhere, not to make it sound like a war or anything but we won, the amount of modified people Vs not modified is close to 50/50 if not  a little in our favour, tattoos and stretched ears are no longer have the stigma they once did.

Okay, so, I'll outline the three methods used:  1) Penile inversion - the most common method worldwide. Obviously this wouldn't work in your case.   2) Colon resection - typically used in western countries, highly invasive, can cause bowel complications and the vagina can have a really unpleasant smell. This is typically only done in trans women with micropenis or who had complications from the initial surgery, thus resulting in their neovagina ""closing up.""  3) Non-inversion vaginoplasty: typically done in Thailand. This uses the scrotum, with tiny holes punched in it to make it more stretchy. This is probably the main thing that would work well.   So: bad news: you'd 100% have to have your testes removed to have any sort of vaginoplasty done, which makes erections pretty difficult. Testosterone replacement would be an option, though.  Other bad news: WPATH guidelines say that you have to have been living full-time as a woman and have been on estrogen replacement therapy for a year prior to any genital surgery, which would almost definitely fuck with your head (it would basically be the exact same thing that us trans women experience before transition, but in reverse. Having the wrong hormone balance totally wrecks your brain). Other other bad news: vaginas themselves don't feel that much sensation, other than ""fullness,"" especially in trans women. We get most of our sensation from our neoclitoris. Other other other bad news: no reputable surgeon will do this.   Good news for you: Thailand has a combination of the right technique and a small handful of surgeons willing to look the other way on things like WPATH guidelines and typical ways of doing genital surgery. Obviously a few people have had it done, and I'd guess that's probably the place to look."

One piece of advice that I learned with this particular piercing is wear a baby sock over it as it heals. Buy a pack of three pair and you have enough to wear all week. I turn them inside out so the softest side is against your skin and I cut the toe out so I do not have to take it off to urinate.

bodymods,2eem9g,Ankah77,2,Sun Aug 24 00:09:39 2014 UTC,I stretched to 8 gauge about 3 weeks ago. It felt good and no soreness. I tried putting in a double flaired saddle and it ripped the back of my ear a tiny bit I took them out right away and put my glass 8 gauge plugs back in. I am going to leave them alone for a while. Should I have waited longer? How the hell do you get a double flaired saddle plug in without this happening again? Nervous I fucked something up :(
bodymods,2eem9g,sabriel_s,3,Sun Aug 24 00:14:30 2014 UTC,"Many people can't wear double flares at all until larger sizes, and certainly not so soon after a stretch. Just have patience."
bodymods,2eem9g,kasto7,2,Sun Aug 24 02:38:27 2014 UTC,"I suggest not stretching with a double flare. It's way more pain than you need to go through, only get double flared when you're at your final size and do not plan to sretch again/for a long while. They're good when you're 100+% healed. They can also cause your ear to tear and blow out at small sizes and with not-fully-healed ears (trust me, I've done it). Use tapers or single flares in surgical/stainless steel, glass or stone. Anything porous like plastic/acetate or wood will only irritate your ear and not allow it to heal properly. Wait longer than you think you need to between stretching as well. It might seem like you're healed, but it's better to do it slower and properly than faster and with possible consequences."
bodymods,2eem9g,sirzack92,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:05:57 2014 UTC,Try working at it.  Pulling on them from time to time is what helped me.  I had a single flair to get use to pulling the flair in and out. I ended up getting my double flair after about 4 days.

Do you research about location and demographics, and do it!  I love my labret. Not quite as much as my ears, but it's certainly less common. The labret definitely is a commitment, because without jewelry I'll drool. Also, be sure to have it done by a reputable piercer and let him/her know that you want to stretch it big. A badly located labret will mess up your teeth or gums. At my current size with t-back jewelry, I honestly can't even feel it, it's so comfortable."

I also have several tattoos that are exposed when I wear some shirts.   One of my tattoos is a watch and the other is a wet paint sign with a bucket of paint and a brush. Those tattoos make most of my customers laugh. The septum I got specifically to be seen by my customers. The septum combined with my handle bar mustache has given me a unique look that makes me memorable.   Many of my customers are very conservative and I want them to see that people with body mods are normal people. Some of us are nice and some of us are jerks, just like people without body mods. I do get asked about the septum and the tats and when the conversation is over I have made a conversion from skeptic to acceptor.   I also have many piercings and tattoos that are hidden ans seen by very few of my customers. I will talk about them with some customers if they show an interest.

bodymods,2dy695,sabriel_s,1 point,Tue Aug 19 05:23:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's about stretching over time. Thing is I've been stuck at 3/4 for about 7 months without any progress, normally doesn't take this long for the diameter to increase. The weight of the jewelry can help a lot because it can pull down on the lobe helping it stretch more naturally without having to use tape or tapers to force the ear to stretch."
bodymods,2dy695,lululxgend,4,Tue Aug 19 13:43:09 2014 UTC,"I would probably still tape.

bodymods,2dtd4h,mrmatchgame,12,Sun Aug 17 18:08:48 2014 UTC,"Stretching slowly is healthier for your skin (no trauma/open wound, no chance for infection if you do it right, etc). If you scalpel or get them dermal punched larger, they very likely will never shrink back down, if you ever think you'll want that as an option. Because it will be an open wound, it'll be way more high maintenance than going up a size every month/few months (depending on what your skin can take).    I'm curious why you phrase it ""should be"" - have your attempts at stretching from 10g to 8g over the past 10 years not gone well? You can go to an APP certified piercer (not just random crappy local shop that has no idea what they're doing) and they can assist you in stretching safely up to the next size.   EDIT: I stand corrected! Apparently 000 does exist. I've never stretched anything past a 2 so my research is less extensive for larger sizes :)"

Some practitioners will do dermal punches or scalpeling, those are going to involve a commitment to aftercare, however. I've had success stretching slowly but consistently by wrapping plugs in electrical tape, one or two layers every week.  As long as you make sure that you're applying tape (and inserting plugs) in a clean environment, it's safe.  I like the method because you make progress consistently, which can help if you're feeling impatient with having small gauges."

What I think OP means is an implant entirely below the surface of the skin, not something that has a visible piece of jewelry on the outside.

bodymods,2dazgp,Eminetics,5,Tue Aug 12 10:50:06 2014 UTC,"The delts are pretty high movement, they're not an ideal place for implants. Discuss this plan with your mod artist for best results.  If they're cool with the location, also ask the original question. The implants can shift slightly during healing so if accuracy is your preference, get the implant first. Having said that, I have no idea what kind of complications could arise from tattooing over an implant."

bodymods,2d0eh7,dickpaste,1 point,Fri Aug 8 23:51:27 2014 UTC,"The best advice I can give is do not play with the piercing! Especially if it is a circular barbell and if one continues to rotate the circular barbell to where the ball is pressing against the hole, the ball will stretch the hole and it will likely tear. Also, take out the body jewelry occasionally to make sure there is no sign of tartar buildup on the piercing, specifically near the external threading. Keep a close eye on any irritation, gum indentation, or scratches in the enamel. Good luck!"
bodymods,2d0eh7,morosecomatose,1 point,Sun Aug 10 02:28:04 2014 UTC,Six years and no migration. It's definitely a piercing to be gentle with though.
bodymods,2d0eh7,burntorangepeels,1 point,Wed Aug 13 03:41:11 2014 UTC,I was told that it would probably be pushed out within a year or so. I'm currently going on 4 years. I have a curved barbell and suspect that may have contributed to its longevity. I did play with it a lot but I guess.

bodymods,2cycby,deathschlager,2,Fri Aug 8 14:39:24 2014 UTC,"You'll be fine with taking it out for the surgery, the length of time you've had it will ensure it won't close up, it might shrink a little bit, but I highly doubt you'll have any issues.

bodymods,2cy68b,Damn-it-man,1 point,Fri Aug 8 03:40:54 2014 UTC,"I had my labret pierced in 2006 at 14g, and have since stretched it to 16mm (5/8 inch), which I've been at for the past year, so I think I can give informed answers to most of your questions:  1) I would say it's around 4g or 2g (for me at least). That was the size at which the hole would leak even without jewelry in place. Now, given enough time, it still may shrink down, but I think that the risk of leakage would always be there after that size.  2) There is no set amount of time, in my view. I just wore a size until it started to get loose (and leak), and then I would go up a millimeter. Once I reached 0g (8mm), I would go up 1mm at a time. Typically, it was between 1 and 2 months. I found my lip to be very stretchy and easily stretched up without effort, especially once I got to around 5mm. Prior to that size, I did use tapers to ease into the next size.  3) I answered this above.  4) There are many vendors on the internet that sell quality jewelry. I bought from Oracle body jewelry (http://www.oraclebodyjewelry.com/labrets/), Heart on Sleeve (http://heartonsleevejewelry.com/), plughog.com, Evolve (http://www.evolvejewelry.com/) and bodyartforms.com.  5) Once I got up to around 11-12mm, I actually found switching to oval jewelry to be more comfortable, since it fits the shape of my lip better. My 5/8 inch oval piece is so comfortable I literally can't feel it. The only time it's an issue is when I eat an apple or corn on the cob: then it is in the way.  Also, be sure to go to a good piercer. Be sure you tell them what your goals are. The location of the piercing is very important: too high and it will catch on the bottom teeth, which would be annoying and damaging to the teeth, and too low and it will rub on the gums and cause gum recession (which is really bad and is irreversible). Mine is perfect, and I've had no damage to my teeth or gums, even with the huge labret.  Best of luck! I still love my labret, and a large gauge labret is very uncommon, and the stone plugs can be so beautiful."
bodymods,2cy68b,bigjimnm,1 point,Fri Aug 8 15:43:35 2014 UTC,"Is there any way you suggest shaving that area? I don't grow a lot of hair in that area, so it wouldn't look good to have that grown out, ya know? Haha  I plan on 4g, but I'll have to wait until I have a proper job (something in the Biomedical Engineering field if my schooling goes well) and establish myself there before I even get it pierced."
bodymods,2cy68b,bigjimnm,1 point,Tue Aug 12 09:21:56 2014 UTC,"I've never had a clean shaven face since I've had my labret pierced (I've worn some kind of facial hair on my chin for the past 15 years), but of course I do regularly trim the hair. I just pop out my plug and use an electric beard trimmer. I imagine if I did shave, I would just shave carefully around the hole without jewelry.  If you first get it pierced, I would just shave as close to the labret stud as possible, since you can't remove the jewelry for a while.  I'm an engineer (Chemical Engineer by training) and work at an engineering software company, and my mods haven't been an issue for me in my career at all.

I never wear it over my clothes at work without at least having a cardigan on top. I'm open about wearing it but it could still potentially get me some unwanted attention if I make it too obvious.

I bounce back and forth between 'do it' and 'research more'. Maybe I'll end up just going for it one day. It's crazy you've had them for so long. I think most of it at this point is, if I had a trusted piercer around here who was willing to do it for me, I'd do it in a heartbeat. The fact that my piercer won't do it really puts me off."
bodymods,2cu02t,Romeo_horse_cock,2,Thu Aug 7 19:15:16 2014 UTC,"Well the biggest reason I wouldn't get them is the scarring. A lot of people start the habit of pulling on the bar and cause a lot more scarring. I've seen some nasty looking ones with keloids. Not pretty. Also you could accidentally chomp on the bars, especially while they're longer and end up chipping some teeth. But that's the risk with all oral piercings. That's just my deal. I'm no expert or anything. But I do think you'd be able to pull it off and if you've done your research and feel good about it and willing to take the risks then okay. Find a good place I guess but if you have some doubts then wait. Good luck."

But keep in mind they're extremely temperamental piercings to have.   They do take a long time to heal. I'd say for mine it was 12 months, then every so often they'd weep when they'd experienced any trauma. They will leave artificial dimples, most of the time. I had no complications in regards to my teeth as the material used was ""bioplast"" (I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this one), which was removed every 6 months and replaced with a fresh bar.  2 years later one side is almost unnoticeable, but the other side you can still see the hole.   Have you considered getting dermal anchors instead?"
bodymods,2cu02t,zeekiz,2,Wed Aug 6 23:58:12 2014 UTC,"I have considered getting dermals in place of piercing but, as dumb as it seems with all the risk, I would much prefer the latter. It sounds even more dumb, but a lot of the appeal of the piercing to me are the artificial dimples. I think they're adorable, and I am aware of the risks. I have been told/have done research to find that dermals are a very short-lived thing, depending on the situation.  I suppose right now I'm trying to pick the less of the two evils.   I have worn bioplast before. It was short after my first piercing was healed. I have a bad habit of chewing on my mouth piercings when I'm anxious, and so far after a Monroe, lip, and VL, none of my teeth have been damaged (knock on wood). I'm not big on the bioplast, but if it's an option, it may as well be considered."

For first hand background on dermal anchors, I also had mine dermal anchored after I took out my cheeks but that only lasted about 1.5 years before one side just wouldn't relax, and eventually came out when I was shaving one night (shaving was quite the challenge). Although that was using older style dermal anchors with smaller holes, the newer styled larger hole dermal anchors do last longer."
bodymods,2cu02t,annewithan_e,1 point,Thu Aug 7 05:26:18 2014 UTC,"I've been debating dermals for a while, as well. It's pretty much if I don't do one, I'm going to do the other. If I were to do dermals of put them right at the top of my cheekbones under the outer corner of my eyes, not as dimples. I really love the look of them there on other people. Hopeful if I don't go with dimples the dermals will fly on me."

The parents & other kindergarten staff are where I wondered if I'd have issues, but as soon as people see how much the kids like me, any worries about my appearance seem to just vanish.

bodymods,2cic80,marxcocacola,9,Sun Aug 3 16:05:04 2014 UTC,"Okay, A few things:  1) You do not need tapers in order to stretch. Your ears will stretch naturally over time. Play with your jewelry, massage your lobes, and it will happen on it's own time scale. Tapers are meant to help insert jewelry of the same size when piercing or if someone's jewelry falls out.   2) It sounds like you might be using a kit. Stretching kits almost always have sub-par jewelry. Wear glass or implant grade steel/titanium.   3) It also sounds like your plugs might be too short for your ears. Buy plugs with a longer wearable area and you should be good to go. If the taper fits all the way through the plug will as well.  4) Try tugging down on your ear when you insert the jewelry, it might help.   Let me know if this doesn't cover the issue and I'll try to find another solution for you."
bodymods,2cic80,ssnakeggirl,3,Sun Aug 3 18:12:49 2014 UTC,"I happened upon a stretching kit that was made of titanium, and was only like 24...26? dollars. Sometimes you can happen upon them. And I have one question, does it cost more to get tunnels/plugs that are longer? And can you get just one of them longer, because I have one lobe that's thicker. And you shouldn't really tug on the ear when you insert the jewelry because it could cause tears because of the fresh streth. Thanks, and kudos. :)"
bodymods,2cic80,Romeo_horse_cock,2,Tue Aug 5 06:40:07 2014 UTC,"There is no way they are of good quality at that price.    You should not be stretching in a way that puts you at risk for tears,  hurts,  or makes it unsafe to tug gently on your jewelry.    Quality plugs are often sold as singles.   They cost more than $25/huge set though."
bodymods,2cic80,ssnakeggirl,1 point,Tue Aug 5 18:01:57 2014 UTC,Well whenever they're fresh you wouldn't put in silicone or wood because of how fresh the stretch is and the skin is more vulnerable to tears and infections when freshly stretched.

bodymods,2cic80,StretchedEarsArePerf,-6,Sun Aug 3 18:00:07 2014 UTC,I use silicone tunnels to stretch mine. Because I can fold them down to fit in the hole then let them expand back out. I know a lot of piercers will say not to do this but it has worked consistently for me. I don't react well to stretching with metal and tapers always blow out the backs. I have big earlobes too. I had to get to a 1/2 inch before my lobes even looked bigger than before I pierced them.   I was able to make a big jump yesterday actually. I was at 3/4 yesterday (with a little extra room) and popped em out to a 7/8 with some squishy tunnels.
bodymods,2cic80,AnoK760,2,Mon Aug 4 16:05:54 2014 UTC,"They say you shouldn't use silicone to stretch because when you put it in it isn't completely...open? I think that's how I would describe it. The silicone has completely stretched and while you have it in your ear it keeps expanding and causes quite a lot of pain for people who don't know. People use tapers because it's the exact size, and doesn't keep expanding. If you blow out the back, perhaps you should ask a piercer about why that's happening? I've never had that problem."
bodymods,2cic80,Romeo_horse_cock,2,Tue Aug 5 06:36:35 2014 UTC,You shouldn't stretch with silicone because it is a porous material and can latch onto a freshly stretched lobe and rip your skin off when you try to remove them.

bodymods,2cjiqw,A_Literal_Dog,1 point,Fri Aug 8 11:37:49 2014 UTC,"Sorry for answering so late, but it looks like nobody answered you on why the placement is unsafe. There's two reasons here-- one, curved barbells are generally considered inappropriate for surface piercings (far greater risk of migration as compared to 90 degree surface bars, which are shaped like this ""["" ) and two, the tongue consists of eight different muscles. Piercing two of these muscles together makes it hard to move the tongue right and hard to heal the piercing. I don't know enough about tongue anatomy to tell you what the chances are of your having two muscles pierced together in this placement, but the issue could be avoided altogether by using a traditional, top-to-bottom tongue piercing. If you're really attached to the aesthetic of this piercing, consider having two traditional tongue piercings in a line.  Hope this is useful info!"

Maybe they are admiring it or maybe they are sneering, but I try not to let it bother me or draw conclusions.   I was photographing a little girl, 4-years-old, with cancer (post chemo) at a public park. Her mother was off to the side, so it was just me following her around the playground and taking photos, laughing, asking her what her favorite ____ was.

bodymods,2c6zfm,DanceScottyDance,3,Thu Jul 31 00:22:21 2014 UTC,"Dude sounds like you stretched pretty damn fast. If you don't plan on going bigger things look like they will be ok. However if you want healthier lobes you could let them shrink down and restretch, or just downsize a few sizes and keep stretching up until your lobes thicken up. You could do lobe massages with oil to help thicken them up as well, if you really don't want to downsize and are happy with how they currently look you could do this, but I would seriously consider downsizing and stretching back up."
bodymods,2c6zfm,alexpai,3,Thu Jul 31 02:57:59 2014 UTC,Thanks I really appreciate the advice!! Ive been using this vitamin E oil cream and it seems to be good for my ears and ive downsized to a 1/2 to make sure my lobes thicken up! Thank you again!

OP, even if youaren't thinking about going past 5/8"" you should seriously consider taking out your jewelry and going naked for several months, doing oil massages, and then starting over.  It's not a race to get to your goal size. Getting to that size should take you a good couple years, not months. Get yourself some nice single flared glass plugs and have some patience. Your ears will look and feel healthier, and they will seriously thank you for it."

I waited a month or 2 inbetween some stretches i know now i should of waited much longer for!  I dont think i would completely close them up just to start stretching them again though, Id rather stay at a 1/2 or downsize more and let my ears just thicken up, as i said i only wanna stay at 5/8s and although you are right it would be worth it for my ears and would make them much healthier but since ive downsized and have started oil massages and sleeping without my plugs in have already started to improve how my lobes feel and look, and they have started to thicken at the thinner points, But thank you for the advice, if my next idea to thicken up doesn't work i shall do just that!"
bodymods,2c6zfm,AnoK760,1 point,Thu Jul 31 20:51:01 2014 UTC,"You don't need to let them close completely. I'd leave your plugs out for about 3months. You should be able to put in a smaller pair.

bodymods,2c3jda,annewithan_e,2,Mon Aug 18 06:40:22 2014 UTC,"I recently ordered some black titanium beads from industrial strength.  They are PVD and additionally they Diamond Like Carbon coated.  I was worried about the safety and I spoke with my piercer (who I trust), and also with a rep from Industrial Strength about the process (I can PM you the correspondence if you want).  I also researched the process myself and was sufficiently okay with it as it is bio-compatible and used in medical applications such as implants/joint replacement.  It's from a reputable company, my piercer has used it in the past with good success, and the coating process is legitimate and used medically.  I do think you can get the bar itself in niobium since that is originally what I wanted, but I was not able to get the beads.  Other options you have would be to get an onyx or hematite bead on a side set circular barbells or the types where the bead is on the top?    Here is an article about the diamond carbon coating:  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014296129190129X http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925963503000189"
bodymods,2bwp4k,gozenurhole,9,Mon Jul 28 02:14:04 2014 UTC,"Well by the sounds of it, it's not infected. Not in a good way admittedly, but not infected.  If you're concerned about the lump, have it checked out by a doctor, or at least a piercer. Scar tissue is super good at getting reabsorbed by the body, and there's a good chance that's all it is. If you're planning on taking the bar out anyway, do that and keep it clean, you'll heal up ok.  Having said that, keeping it clean NEVER involves peroxide. Use an antibacterial mouthwash, or, if you can handle the taste, saline. They will be way more gentle, and more importantly, better for your body during healing."
bodymods,2bwp4k,CheezyMcWang,2,Mon Jul 28 05:09:37 2014 UTC,Thanks for all the advice. It feels much better now that I have removed it. The bump is still there and a bit tender. I'll switch to using mouthwash and if it isn't getting better by Tuesday I'll get it looked at.
bodymods,2bwp4k,angelenabee,4,Mon Jul 28 07:36:27 2014 UTC,"Don't leave it out. If it is infected, the open hole will allow the infection a way out, but taking it out will close the infection in. I recommend getting some non-alcoholic, antiseptic mouthwash and swishing with that. Also, change the jewelry to something that is surgical steel or higher quality. Shitty jewelry can cause a lot of issues. Mine has been pierced for about four years and it still gets sore every once in a while, but it's usually from food getting caught in there (I have it stretched to a 4g, so the opening is larger). Use the mouthwash to swish without the jewelry in first, then replace it with the higher quality jewelry. If it doesn't heal within a week, or gets worse within the next few days, go see your piercer and get their opinion."
bodymods,2bwp4k,J0HNN0,1 point,Mon Jul 28 05:10:44 2014 UTC,"The lump sounds like scar tissue to me too. But watch it and see if it gets any bigger. Resist playing with it and especially don't touch it unless you have really clean hands and nails. If any doubt a trip to your piercer or doctor is wise, perhaps while you are having a pregnancy checkup?"
bodymods,2bwp4k,maihar,1 point,Mon Jul 28 19:36:25 2014 UTC,"Please nevermind the ""don't take it out"" advice. I had mine pierced for a couple of years when I removed it 12 years ago and it is still open. If t is infected, it will still be able to drain. If you start to run a fever or have any swollen lymph nodes the see a doctor.  Also, do what is comfortable to you. Being pregnant seems to have odd effects on piercings for some people. Good luck getting it better and CONGRATULATIONS on the pregnancy!!!"

Even when Shannon was writing again for the blog, it wasn't nearly as active as his Facebook page for the same thing was. Pretty much anyone can write for modblog if they want to, and at this point there's just not a lot of people offering to blog about it (because it takes a lot of work to actively come up with and find new relevant content that doesn't get stale quickly).

My childhood foolishness led to a lot of body mods that turned out to be okay in the long run, but I ultimately regret being a stubborn kid who thought I was a cool cat for being so modded at that age. If I could go back in time and talk myself out of it, I definitely would."

A little different, I regret letting my stretched ears shrink. I had to take out my plugs for work and it was ""too much of a hassle"" to put them back in after my shift. Now they're a third of the size, I can't put anything bigger than like a 08 or a 10 in them, and stretching feels more painful than it did when I was doing it originally.

bodymods,2buueh,Never_Washes_Denim,2,Sun Jul 27 13:30:54 2014 UTC,"Scarification is literally cutting away the layer of skin that the tattoo would be in, so you would end up with white scar tissue there (assuming it heals cleanly, which it sometimes doesn't).  Scar tissue, especially intentional/very thick scar tissue like what occurs after scarification, is very hard to tattoo over.  The ink doesn't stick and you wind up with a blotchy, faded looking tattoo.    My advice would be for you to contact a really excellent tattoo artist in your area and see what they can do for you via coverup.  You can also look into laser removal or other methods of tattoo fading/removal if you want to just try to start over, but please be aware that they often do not work, especially with very dark tattoos on very pale skin.    It might be easier to give ya advice if you had a photo of your tattoo and details on what you don't like about it up here. :)"

bodymods,2buueh,beeasaurusrex,5,Sun Jul 27 14:11:00 2014 UTC,"This absolutely isn't too dark to be covered up by a skillful artist.    Check out /r/tattoos/ and search for your state or a city near you for good examples, and make sure you 'vet' shops and artists (IE: go see them, watch them work if they'll let you, check out their porfolio(s), and talk to people who've had work done by them) before committing to it, but pretty much anything I could see you being unhappy with about that tattoo is fixable.  :)"

I'm getting a new tattoo next week and I'm going to ask the people at the shop their opinions on it.  And how raised is your scarification? Are there different things you can do during the healing process to change the effects of it?"
bodymods,2buueh,kjwx,2,Tue Jul 29 15:35:48 2014 UTC,"Mine's barely raised. I can feel it when I touch it, but otherwise not noticeable. I just did basic aftercare to promote healing because the black work around it already made it very visible. A lot of it just depends on how your body heals, but I know some people that don't do the scars over black will do various things to interrupt the healing, cause further trauma and more pronounced scars."

After cutting, my piercer LIBERALLY rubbed coarse salt in my wound. When I thought I couldn't endure that much more, he drowned it in lemon juice. For two weeks after, my boyfriend had to scrub my back daily with a toothbrush to promote keloids. Still better than the sharp stick and ash used by some tribes."

bodymods,2buueh,bella26piano,1 point,Thu Jul 31 17:55:59 2014 UTC,"Pain schmain ... Nah, it wasn't too bad. The salt was BAD but the lemon juice quenched that agony quick smart.  Took 2.5 hours each side and about halfway through the piercer and I were so busy talking that we kind of 'forgot' what was going on. Except for up around my shoulders, it was a breeze. He later said it was like slicing a hot knife through butter.  Worse part was immediately after getting the first side done: Started craving spinach (which I hate) and bawling in the supermarket while trying to buy said vegetable that I'd just ruined my life. Oh and waking up the next day to find myself stuck to the bedsheet. Time-wise: It's lasted really well. This was back before skin removal so it's not as impressive as the designs being done today but if I wear low-backed shirt I'm always amazed at how people will spot it across a large room.  I don't keloid well so it's faded to a gorgeous silvery pink, slightly bumpy, slightly sunken scar. Experience-wise: It's more like getting a tattoo than a piercing. The initial outline's a bitch but the shading tickles.  TLDR: Piece of cake."

bodymods,2bht9w,VeryDangerousPerson,3,Wed Jul 23 14:08:24 2014 UTC,I don't think this will matter much but I am a woman and I have had mine pierced since I was 18. I will be 26 soon.   I started with horizontal piercings then upped it to both horizontal and vertical. I had problems with the vertical ones.   I too had my nipple swollen and trying to eat the ball on the bar bell. I would suggest NOT taking it out but going back to your shop or one that is endorsed by the APA in your area and getting a longer bar. what's happened is for some reason either it being infected or the swelling from getting it pierced or both are causing this. I would also get some sea salt from the store and mix up some sea salt and water and fill a shot glass and flip it over your nipple and let it chill. Then I'd take some sea salt on a q-tip and kinda clean the crusties off if it. Then I'd let them air dry and move along with my day. I'd suggest doing this several times a day.  Personally I would mix the sea salt solution a little more stout at first. Use the warmest water you can comfortably tolerate.   But you need a longer bar also. Once they are healed up you can put the short bar back in. I've also found that being a girl sucks because of bras in the summer time. You'll see a lot more of the crusties. Drink lots of water.

I can't imagine how a person would be able to comfortable open and close their hand with raised scars on it."
bodymods,2az29w,ambermonkey,2,Thu Jul 17 22:15:38 2014 UTC,"You can't really control the level of scarring anyway; you can try to compensate for differences by keeping the parts that are less affected by movement open until the more affected parts can ""catch up"", but no one has this down to a perfect science because there are too many variables to account for in every case.  I think as long as a person was sure to not let the cuts heal their hand 'closed'/they ensured they still had full extension, you wouldn't really feel it after it healed..."
bodymods,2az29w,BinarySo10,2,Thu Jul 17 22:51:39 2014 UTC,"The issue is it wouldn't scar evenly. Parts of it will move more and it will look uneven most likely. Also, they'll be much more likely to infected since they'd be harder to protect. Even if you exercise and stretch it it could scar sufficiently enough to reduce hand mobility depending on placement. Scarring is hard to predict, and I'd consider carefully before a placement like the palm."

bodymods,2az29w,mcstanky,4,Thu Jul 17 19:34:02 2014 UTC,"I think the same thing goes for scarification as it does for tattoos; anywhere the skin regenerates or sloughs off at a higher rate than the rest of your body is going to have your design become fuzzy/unrecognizable a lot faster.  You may have better luck keeping a brand clear than scars, but I'm not a mod artist so I'm not the last word on this either.   Of your two designs, the one on top would be way too detailed to have done anywhere near palm sized. The second one may work, but scars and brands won't usually give you a line that's less than 2mm wide and even then, that's pushing it. Just something to keep in mind when looking at designs; the skill of the artist will determine how finely they're able to detail too."
bodymods,2az29w,BinarySo10,3,Thu Jul 17 22:07:06 2014 UTC,You would probably have much better luck with electrocautery branding. It would give you the definition you want with probably a more even scar. There's a couple pictures on BME you can google palm electrocautery.

bodymods,2arnhv,kink1134,-1,Tue Jul 15 21:14:49 2014 UTC,8 years on one bar holy shit thats dedication! but srsly try a shorter one with a high grade material should clear it right up. or go acrylic balls. im assuming its 14g so internal thread is not nessecary and will be very uncommon in tounge jewlery. the reason that is recommended by so many is shoving threads through a fresh or tight peircing is bad juju. but if you are changing out tight or fresh jewlry you are no taking proper care of your piercings in the first place.
bodymods,2arnhv,kink1134,2,Thu Jul 17 20:12:16 2014 UTC,Thank you for the reply. I popped into my piercers yesterday and they said the bar was too big and changed it to a smaller one for me and things have been better since so I think all is well now!

bodymods,2arnhv,throwaway9415,1 point,Mon Jul 21 08:12:48 2014 UTC,Fuck are you talking about? Internal threading is ALWAYS necessary and very common.   External threads = bad. always. Even in healed piercings.
bodymods,2arnhv,kink1134,0,Wed Jul 23 11:49:51 2014 UTC,"ummm no external threads are just fine they have absolutly no effect n the actual peircing once they are in, infact if most peircers ""load"" the needle so the thread actually has no part in the process at all untill you change it after it is healed. and once it is healed the threads shouldent matter as long as you are not changing it every three min, the only reason internal threads are reccomended over external is the irritation factor of changing jewlry too soon or in an inflamed piercing/new tight piercing where dragging the threads through can irritate the skin. just an fyi."
bodymods,2arnhv,throwaway9415,3,Wed Jul 23 18:46:42 2014 UTC,"No, that's not true. - Piercer.   External threads are sharp enough to scrape even a well healed piercing open very, very easily. Piercing with oversized needles is unnecessary and creates unnecessary bleeding and trauma and there is absolutely no reason to do it. Further, no company makes externally threaded jewelry in quality materials or styles. It's all garbage. Don't let hack piercers brainwash you into thinking it's unnecessary. External threads cause damage every time wether you notice it or not."
bodymods,2arnhv,kink1134,-1,Wed Jul 23 19:02:42 2014 UTC,"ummm seriously? im pretty sure ive orderd barbells in 14k gold, surgical steel and titanium, and guess what all came externally threaded, thats why they have been used for 40 years now, yes it is case by case some peoples skin (mywifes) is very sensitive and some of thier peircings require internal. as for loading, that is a widly practiced method and has been used for most of modern piercings history, piercing with a 12 vs a 14 is such a nominal diffrence it makes no diffrence. infact the trauma of trying to run a = or possibly+ sized peice of jewlry behind a needle or even after you pull it out is very traumatizing and runs a high risk of tearing and ripping and causing scarring and other unnessecary complications. you might want to be careful who you call a hack, is internal better depends on which aspect, putting on the ends its a pain in the ass, constantly canging jewlery yes it is its all situation and location but it is not a catch all cure all unless you are just trying to upsell your clients."

A ring that is too small at the outset could cause you problems if you swell up a lot, so yeah, it might be best to avoid them at the very beginning. A larger diameter seamless ring could definitely be a possible option if you're open to the idea of it not sitting snug?"

I'm transgender and will probably not be able to afford surgery for quite some time, so I often feel like I don't have control over my body, my appearance, or how I'm perceived. Body modification is one very concrete way to deal with that. It also helps me claim ownership-- this isn't a ""female"" body or one that I'm trapped with, it's mine.

bodymods,2acc4z,malprintemps,3,Thu Jul 10 19:37:09 2014 UTC,"So implants and not a tattoo, as in the title? I was wondering how you could make a relief tattoo. Dissaopinted."
bodymods,2acc4z,J0HNN0,2,Thu Jul 10 18:57:32 2014 UTC,"This looks very photoshopped. The bumps are way more pixelated than her skin, and they all look exact the same."
bodymods,2acc4z,Driftmaster,2,Fri Jul 11 00:22:30 2014 UTC,It is. It's concept art.
bodymods,2acc4z,woofiegrrl,2,Fri Jul 11 01:52:58 2014 UTC,Instead of using implants why not just laser brand the dots?  Should still raise a little and maintain position.
bodymods,2acc4z,inopportuneflirt,1 point,Fri Jul 11 04:30:59 2014 UTC,"Klara Jirkova's braille tattoo, a two-row pattern of tactile sentences across the upper back of a woman's body. Klara Jirkova, a student at the University of Arts in Berlin, came up with the innovation to modify the body to allow the blind to feel those artistic statements through their sense of touch.The raised bumps that make up these braille tattoos consist of implants under the skin, and could include individual beads or a small tablet of embossed text. The beads can be relatively small, but not as small as standard braille text as the body’s muscles would absorb them too deep to touch  www.klaara.net"
bodymods,2acc4z,throwaway9415,9,Thu Jul 10 16:13:26 2014 UTC,"Bullshit, website claims ""in research"" and offers an extremely bland and basically flawed idea of how subdermal implants idea. The 'artist' here didn't create anything."
bodymods,2acc4z,woofiegrrl,3,Thu Jul 10 19:32:44 2014 UTC,"It's concept art at this time. She's never promoted it as real. But a lot of people, including OP, mistake it as such."
bodymods,2ae5jt,thefirstcarter,4,Fri Jul 11 02:54:21 2014 UTC,The needle makes a really neat crunch sound when it gets through the cartilage. That was honestly the worst part of the piercing process for me. After that you basically just need to learn how to sleep on it without some pretty intense discomfort/pain.
bodymods,2ae5jt,manofdamoon,1 point,Mon Jul 14 08:26:01 2014 UTC,"yeah, i didn't hear a crunch cause i was a bit too focused on the pain i was feeling lol. i've had it for two days now and there's surprisingly less pain than i've expected. hardly even any bleeding. i've found that it helps to lay on my side and cuddle a pillow or something similar, it helps me not want to roll over in the middle of the night."
bodymods,2ae5jt,CheezyMcWang,3,Mon Jul 14 15:33:18 2014 UTC,"From my experience, more pain during the piercing, and more discomfort when trying to sleep on it.  Totally worth it though."
bodymods,2ae5jt,maxhax,1 point,Fri Jul 11 12:35:40 2014 UTC,"thanks, i'm going to get it tomorrow and i'm so stoked :)"
bodymods,2ae5jt,tackie,2,Sat Jul 12 05:13:46 2014 UTC,"You probably know this already, but you're gonna have to really baby it for a while. Mine took over 9 months to heal fully. That said, I was skiing all winter, and putting it under layers of hats and helmet and not being too nice to it, so your experience could might not be mine. Also, the second piercing hurts worse than the first. Good luck! Its completely worth all the trouble."
