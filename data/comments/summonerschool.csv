summonerschool,3e20uh,TangerineX,6,Tue Jul 21 10:12:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much sir, i will discuss this with my support. But i have a question: What duos are more opened to Aggresive Zoning just from the comp? I mean with no exp, items or kill advantage."
summonerschool,3e20uh,TheBubblePopper2000,4,Tue Jul 21 14:31:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say the best 3 ADC for this is Caitlyn, Draven, and MF. Caitlyn can zone very aggressively with traps, Draven has a zone of control with damage very early, and it's very hard to trade with a MF, pair with her strut and her early damage. Ranged supports with a lot of poke will often do this position if ahead, such as Zyra, Lulu, Sona. However, pretty much every single bot lane comp should be capable of doing this.  What matters in this composition way more than team composition is positioning and power. The goal of this position is to zone and and apply pressure when you can. Sometimes (as mentioned in the comments) if a blitz misses a hook, you can be hyper aggressive for a few seconds, and back up in to your formation.   For example, you see the enemy jungler show top and your level 1/2/3 is stronger than the enemy 1/2/3. You can now take advantage of this and move a little closer to the minion wave as a more aggressive stance. Typically when the jungler is top, you have about 45 seconds of freedom to do whatever you want."
summonerschool,3e20uh,FiveDollarSketch,3,Tue Jul 21 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"I've had lots of luck being hyper aggressive as Sona early. Her burst hurts. She pairs very well with Cait, but cait's not often played from what I've seen. Do NOT go hyper aggressive as sona against thresh / blitz without minions to block hooks. That being said, if a hook has been thrown and missed pre-4, that's when you and your ADC should go super aggressive for 5-6 seconds."
summonerschool,3e20uh,yace987,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:40 2015 UTC,I'm sure Sona pairs very well too.
summonerschool,3e20uh,abigwiener,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"My brother and I duo Q bot lane with Kalista+Sona and we have a 70% winrate at gold/plat. Sona's poke with kalista's passive is very surprising burst for most laners. 90% of the time we have a kill or have forced someone to back before level 4. If Sona lands her poke, Kalista can trigger the passive with a well placed long range Q allowing her to safely poke. After that we play hyper aggressive and zone them from farm while we freeze close to our turret.   Sona is still pretty squishy early so try not to take too much poke until you hit level 2 so she can heal. Level 3 Kalista gets a big power spike and can start to look for an all in. Voice communication makes this extremely easy."
summonerschool,3e20uh,niler1994,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:54 2015 UTC,"most lanebullys, i8 like Janna + Draven because if the enemy comes close he just gets to eat an axe and draven is still safe because of janna.  mostly is somth like Draven/Graves/Cait(early)/Corki+All in or heavy poke support BLitz/Naut/Zyra/Sona etc   i prob forgot a few/a ton but you can do it with any lnae if you egt ahead, the ones i mentioned are when it's rater evn (and are matchup dependent aswell)"
summonerschool,3e20uh,Gn732,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:17 2015 UTC,Bully or kill lanes can play aggressive form lvl 1. Any caitlyn lane or a lane containing champs like Draven or Graves who have strong all ins especially if you have an all in support like Annie or Leona
summonerschool,3e20uh,burgermeizter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:19 2015 UTC,Karma + Cait is a great aggressive combo too. Karma has great early game aggression when you build Spellthiefs Edge

summonerschool,3e20uh,10sion,2,Tue Jul 21 12:42:41 2015 UTC,"Great post, thank you. I've been watching streams trying to analyze this exact thing, now I'll have some idea of what to look for.  I'm not sure you described the actual formation in the 'zoning' position. Is it just being near enough to the enemy to 'threaten hooks or pokes?' Could you clarify that one for me?"
summonerschool,3e20uh,abigwiener,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"For example, you and your support are at 100% health while the enemy adc+support are at ~50%. Obviously, if they tried to fight you  2v2 they would lose. So, you freeze the minion wave in front of your turret and stand in between the minion wave and the enemy laners. You can still get cs and exp from that position but the enemy adc+support are zoned from getting near the minions otherwise you and your support would kill them when they go into cs.  You zone the enemy players from getting CS and exp. You can zone when you have a big advantage in a 2v2 and the minion wave is on your side or in the middle."

summonerschool,3e3stq,treehau5_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"Great guide! Soraka is in a really strong place right now. Especially since the two ADCs with grievous wounds are not meta. I have been spamming Raka in ranked and I agree that she needs to be built AP. She has a 0.6 ratio on her W heal and a 0.55 - 0.825 ratio on her R!!!   I do her rune page differently and if you can afford to have a Raka specific rune page I would highly recommend it:   Armor Reds Scaling heath regen/lvl yellows AP Blues Flat Health Regen Quints   Running these runes really makes up for her nerfed health regen and lets you spam those heals.   About the item build:  I usually go Banner of Command rather than Locket. Soraka can use the AP, and the banner active lets you do fun things.   Also, I am sometimes finding room in my build for a Ardent Censer. With devourer junglers now popular it isn't unusual to have 2-3 autoattackers in your team, and it gives 1k gold worth of stats per person. With your ulti, this is a 5k gold advantage for 5 seconds. It is still situational, but can be extrememly strong with some team comps."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Zestus,23,Tue Jul 21 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"If you just care about stomping lane? Quinn. Ranged harass, blind,  and a gtfo me scrub move that resets you to max auto range"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,ownagemobile,4,Tue Jul 21 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"As a Quinn main, I think it falls to a skill match up. If Riven stuns you mid vault, you're done"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,zoopy909,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's actually why I save vault for third riven Q. Blind her on the first and kite back as you can, and if she tries to get the knock up you vault it. There's not a good option for them to ki strike mid Q, and at that point they've used most of their movement spells and lost some cc to it.  Plausibly it doesn't work against better riven players. I'm at high gold/low plat, so while animation canceled rivens exist here, they all lack the split second decision making you see with higher ranked rivens and just try to brute force things."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,ManetherenRises,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:46 2015 UTC,That sounds like it requires crazy reaction or prediction. Probably not possible without really low ping

summonerschool,3e2lx4,facedesker,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:12 2015 UTC,Low ping helps but it's not that hard. Its similar to hitting LeBlanc mid dash. And you really expect riven mains to have difficty pressing 1 button at the right time?
summonerschool,3e2lx4,JDandthepickodestiny,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I played quinn against a lot of rivens, I only ever lost to one.   as long as youre in a good position to vault you'll win everytime. She will be forced to build a little armor too."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,dremic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:36 2015 UTC,IMO Quinn gets outscaled by virtually any top laner. I don't recommend her.

To combat this, I often go for Bork / Lucidity boots / Cleaver / Last Whisper / IE / PD with upgraded stealth ward trinket. Just go full split push mode or dive into their backline to maybe kill their two carries."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,Syd1804,13,Tue Jul 21 15:41:51 2015 UTC,Why isn't nobody here mentioning Maokai? Your passive helps a lot with outsustaining and outrading her in lane.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,DreyX,6,Tue Jul 21 14:44:51 2015 UTC,The korean pros use riven as a maokai counter.  Riven can chunk maokai out too hard and then zone him from using passive
summonerschool,3e2lx4,meman666,5,Tue Jul 21 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm getting the feeling that the people commenting have never really played the matchup.  They just read champion abilities and decide X counters Y.    Mao is my second most played champion this season (67% win rate), and he is not a fun matchup into Riven."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,ocdscale,0,Tue Jul 21 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"Then again, this is the question OP is asking. Is there any champ it's fun to pick into Riven?"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Omnilatent,4,Tue Jul 21 19:48:17 2015 UTC,And his Q blocks her combo
summonerschool,3e2lx4,curlbrah69,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"Does his passive scale with her Q, so he gets three stacks, one per Q?"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,robocop12,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:21 2015 UTC,"A full Riven combo, 3x Q, W and E will give Maokai 5 stacks, a couple stacks from your own abilities and you're guaranteed your passive will heal you one or even two times during a trade. As long as you don't go into a full blown fight until someone dies Maokai will simply out sustain Riven since Riven doesn't have any built in sustain and terrible health regen. Eventually you become too tanky as well. During a team fight you just need to peel her off with W & Q and she's useless."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,xVino,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:24 2015 UTC,Yes
summonerschool,3e2lx4,JackThePeacey,3,Tue Jul 21 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"Because while your sustain is nice, you can't actually win a trade, you just don't lose them by very much. And after level 6 and when Riven has 1-2 items, her all-in is generally a kill. The worst thing about the Riven vs Maokai match-up is that since Maokai is so slow and lacks escapes, that if Riven starts snowballing she can just kill him over and over again. Maokai can't even farm in lane if Riven starts to get ahead."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,akillerfrog,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:31 2015 UTC,Mao was always my favorite. You can avoid her knockup/stun with W. You can stop her 3rd Q with your Q. You can chase her dash with your W. She loves spamming which gives you heals. Your ult reduces the damage of hers (obviously it works to reduce damage in general but her ult is AoE so it's especially helpful). Maokai is pretty much the strongest Riven counter I've ever played.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,axxl75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:04 2015 UTC,Lol I lost my lane so hard during my diamond promos as maokai sustain my ass I couldn't go near a minions to hit that passive

summonerschool,3e2lx4,akillerfrog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"Sunfire isn't all that great on Renekton right now. You're better off building Randuin's early instead. The stats are better, the slow active is really important on someone like Renekton who gets beaten by being kited, and you're getting enough damage from Hydra/BC, that the Sunfire damage isn't particularly relevant. The only champs that have Sunfire as a core item are champs that split push without waveclear like Shen. Renekton has shit tons of waveclear after Hydra with his AoE from his kit. Just a thought."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,IreliAmTrying,5,Tue Jul 21 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"Irelia is a decent counter to riven if played well , however its worth noting (even though you dont want to hear it) the riven is probably better than you in laning, and dont expect to win - a riven player with a load of games and same rank as you will probably have mastered the matchups to a higher degree and you can't really expect to straight up smash them on a counter champion."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,robocop12,2,Tue Jul 21 14:09:51 2015 UTC,That's one matchup I just don't know how to play as an irelia main.

summonerschool,3e2lx4,2bloom,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"Avoid early trading. Do not feed a kill, max e, get sheen and u can all in on 6 when she blows cds. If u manage to kill her once it only gets easier. Your damage becomes more consistent through w max 2nd and u get tanky because of frozen heart. It is important to get the stun though.

summonerschool,3e2lx4,2bloom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:08 2015 UTC,The 20% CDR and the big amount of armor makes you both tanky (remember that you heal from w and ult) and stronger as your stuff is up a lot more.

Irelia carries u has a guide and a video matchup  Tl;dw is in the video description, pretty much: put  2/3 points in w then max e, trade after 7-9 preferably with sheen, let her engage so she wastes skills damage. Also, remember her ulti cooldown is longer than yours and I find a lot of rivens will take a bad trade there.   Build trinity -> frozen heart and you're stronger for a few items but she will eventually outscale you if you build tanky, havent really played AD/damage irelia"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,pagandreamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"I usually start cloth armor, do a camp, get flask, tele to lane, rush tabi, then farm and play safe until sheen/tf. Usually the way I play Irelia against any lane bully. The trick is to turn agression around. Wait for them to miss something and over commit, then trade. Irelia is awesome to punish over agression."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,odd_1nt3g3r5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"Irelia is a counteragressing champion. To beat riven, wait until she aggresses on you and then turn it on her with an all in. In lane you should have almost perfect CS as irelia, something that riven can't match. If she doesn't aggress you win by pushing in and passive farming +harass under turret. If she does go aggressive stun her ass under minion aggro and go to town. If riven kills you once or twice your counter is gone, but with experience you can learn to never give that to her.   Unfortunately riven is just a dangerous champion. Even when you play the counter champions, losing a little usually ends in you losing a lot. Nobody likes to hear it but the way to beat riven starts with a champion counter and ends with you getting good."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,vaporeon122,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:44 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider is that if she shields right as you E, and you're not too far ahead in terms of items, you should back out as you are likely to lose the trade. Early on you can try to get some harass off with E+AA if she wastes her Q trying to farm. I've played the matchup as both champions quite a few times and even if Riven is ahead a kill or two, once Irelia gets triforce and maybe a Ninja Tabi or other armor item, Riven shouldn't be able to outtrade her."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,-pkpkay-,6,Tue Jul 21 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"If you can survive.  Don't get greedy for CS and for the love of god don't give her a kill.  Once Nasus builds momentum, Riven can't do much to stop him but that's if he's able to build momentum.  A good riven will zone out the Nasus for most of the laning phase so you'll have 100 stacks at like 20 mins."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Valientt,0,Tue Jul 21 15:58:31 2015 UTC,How do you get zoned for 20 mins if you just farm under tower? It only takes some basic wave management to get things into a spot where you can farm safe as Riven pushes the wave every time she tries to trade with you.  I've seen quite a few of these threads before and every high elo Riven has stated that a well played Nasus is near impossible to beat without heavy jungle help.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,-pkpkay-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"Basic wave management?   The same idea can goes towards Riven favor.    A good riven won't push the wave every time she trades.  In fact, they won't push the wave towards Nasus's favor at all.  The worst thing she could do is trade with him and Q the minion wave.   Most like they will do a jungle camp and then teleport to lane.  The wave will already be pushing in their favor.  Then it's simply a matter of zoning and harassing.  The worst thing a Riven can do is let Nasus farm under turret as that's exactly what he wants."

Pretty much any lane can be won by and against riven if you know the matchup well enough. The issue you're having is that riven players are usually one trick ponies that know all matchups fairly well, whereas other top laners might not know the matchup too well."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,JDandthepickodestiny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"I would strongly recommend not picking darius. I fucking love that matchup. Its very possible that simply all of them at my elo suck, but unless they rush an armor item you outscale them extremely quickly. And even if they do you just farm up and become much more useful."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,rmonik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"Mhm, i don't really like the darius matchup personally. Maybe i don't play it well but i can't figure out a set way to trade in this lane because of how heavily it relies on him missing his Q or you shielding it. That said i rarely see dariuses so maybe i just don't have enough experience on it. That said i rarely lose the lane simply because how hard he pushes lane and gets camped for it lol."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,JDandthepickodestiny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:12 2015 UTC,"The trick is you simply do not trade early. Bait a trade at level one when he goes for a last hit near your creeps. If he started with his aoe thingy as most do even if you don't shield it you take a little damage but now the wave is pushing to you. You're now free to farm just outside your tower or under it. Just be careful of getting hooked because it has a range way longer than its animation. This is one of the few times as riven where it may actually pay to take scaling runes. Assuming he didn't start ignite and you teleport (In which case go in anyway if you hit 6 first.) You should be able to duel him if he hasn't bought any armor at 6. Its okay to be zoned off a few CS early. Just don't push the wave or give up a kill and you win the matchup. You don't even need to kill him, just don't fall absurdly behind in CS."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,captain_dux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"Rengar gets dumpstered by riven 10/10 times if the Riven knows what she is doing.

I find nasus and heimerdinger to be the two must infuriating opponents. If they're good, kennen and vladimir are also terrifying. This might suprise some people because vladimir and nasus are typically seen as countered by Riven.  Not going to go into huge detail, but my reasons for each one:  Nasus- outscales and stacks armor. Donger-  very hard to kill if he takes exhaust. And he will. Get pushed on all day. Kennen- kiting for days, insane harass. He can actually 1v1 you if you Q max and don't hit all 3. It's pretty ridiculous if the kennen is good. Vladimir- If you don't kill him in an all in, he'll heal back to full before you can all in him again while poking you down.  Darius is a hard matchup if he doesn't mess up (I usually find an opportunity) or jungler ignores top (if they're good, they shouldn't ignore this matchup. It's practically free kills on darius)."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,SkrybeLOL,5,Tue Jul 21 19:23:29 2015 UTC,"Riven is a burst AD champion. So, what counters this stuff? HP and armor. And there's one guy who has a particularly good synergy with these stats -- Malphite. Oh, and he just got buffed. Give it a try. I personally haven't encountered any master of Riven, but I've fought against several Riven mains, and Malph is one of the champs I've had the best success against her. You probably won't kill her 1v1, unless you get an early lead (kills, that is) in lane, but you're so tanky and annoying that she can't kill you -- you basically win through mind games. Annoy her till she tilts!"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,J_the_Man,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:33 2015 UTC,Yup and just make sure to ward because she will roam looking for blood like a hungry vampire. Call MIAs ASAP.

summonerschool,3e2lx4,Shana_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:57 2015 UTC,Good riven players will go for early lifesteal and a LW or BC if you pick malphite and then just kill you because she has so much damage in her kit.  He can't escape her unless he has his ult up and she can ignore his harass with E.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Nickdooo,8,Tue Jul 21 15:43:42 2015 UTC,Alistar lol. Just Headbutt her away or in your own tower. After lvl 6 she can't do anything.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,LittlePyro1377,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:58 2015 UTC,Alistar ಠ_ಠ?
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Nickdooo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:25 2015 UTC,"Its surprising what an off-meta pick (actually in this case more of an off-role pick) can do to screw with the momentum of others. In this case, Alistar has 2 skills that are hard CC, a heal, is fairly tanky, and his ulti gives him a lot of tank power since its a % damage reduction. Give him a bit of farm so he can get true tank items, and he's next to unkillable.  The only reason, as far as I can tell, that people stopped playing Alistar top (you may recall him being a pick or ban champion in S4 for toplane) was because of the change where you can't get off a free auto from headbutting someone and maybe a mana cost adjustment (I'm not too sure about this). That's 50~70 damage per trade you just lost there - free damage at that because they can't trade back since they're knocked away from you. Doesn't mean he can't work though."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,LittlePyro1377,0,Tue Jul 21 17:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I'm not quiet sure, what to build on him. Maybe something like Trinity, blade/hydra or even AP Bruiser, his heal works pretty well with Rylais. :D"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,daswef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:37 2015 UTC,"The build that most people built (because I don't play Alistar, I'm going with the pack opinion) is RoA/Righteous Glory into full tank, maybe even both RoA and Righteous Glory. The thing is because of the 70% damage reduction, you might as well build health early on so you could take advantage of the fact that you can block every kind of damage except true damage effectively, compared to say a Frozen Heart where, sure its great at blocking physical damage but it does nothing for magic damage, so its built later for CDR and more mana. RoA gives good tank stats in health and mana for him to spam, and Righteous Glory is... well, Righteous Glory. Would you say no to even stronger initiation?  If anything, I'd say he's analogous to Makai. Extremely strong CC, ridiculous initiation, very tanky with ulti. The difference is Alistar's tankiness is selfish (Maokai gives lesser damage reduction but to everyone in the radius), but Alistar offers a heal for everyone in his E, making him decent in siege situations or when you're being sieged."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Treemo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:12 2015 UTC,The build from last worlds is not bad.  Triforce rush is good.  Righteous Glory being added is a good item for him in any role.  Tanky items and Shiv can round things out.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,daswef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"Triforce rush is not that great anymore, the reason why they built it in LCS was because he could auto after W while the enemy was in the air, and there was nothing the enemy could do to retaliate."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Lokemix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"You can still trade with E+auto+W, and you still get the same damage from your W+Q+AA combo.    He was straight up broken in lane before, and even though he can't do the free trades the build isn't bad."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,GD_Insomniac,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"Lissandra shits on her too. Get too close? w and freeze her. She goes all in on you? Ult her or ult yourself and leg it. You have an escape/engage and lots of disgusting poke with Q.  Granted you are squishy compared to some of the other suggestions here, but Riven isn't a hard matchup for Liss."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Partisan189,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:30 2015 UTC,"Swain will kick her teeth in. Her shield is mostly useless against his DoT effects, and if you try to close with a Swain you get to learn about Q's .9 AP ratio combined with 8-20% bonus from E. Once all the dashes get put on CD he drops W and just autoattacks. With R its even harder.  Basically, getting to Swain as Riven is HARD. She gets brutally punished for every creep, and since Swain's R is basically always up she can't capitalize on her short R CD like she can against Kennen.  Not to mention he can straight rush Zhonya's and be 100% happy with the item.  EDIT: this is also a pretty easy lane mechanically. I've read all the other responses and people are recommending champs and saying ""this only works if you are good and don't fuck up."" Swain has only 1 spell that he needs to aim, and its pretty easy to land while Q is active, even against Riven. There is no way to fuck it up except to make stupid decisions like putting your spells on CD for farm when she is in a position to start a trade. Swain has HP/MP sustain, brutal targeted mixed damage (E amps your AA damage, so you actually get some pretty hard-hitting autos between 6 and 9 while E is really getting powered up), anti-melee CC and the potential to force flash with a normal spell in standoffs.  Also, a problem that lots of mages have against Riven is that if she can block a decent chunk of your burst with her shield, you probably don't have enough damage left to actually kill her, so she dives with impunity. Swain deals damage till he runs out of mana, so you can worry less about her shield and just roll her over in trades post-6."

Then, when Riven hits 6, she can flash on you with the knockup stun 2nd R and kill you before you're out of the CC as a squishy.

If Riven can W Garen's Q every time, it's hard for him to win the matchup.  Same thing with Quinn's E.  As Quinn, I will try not to be near Riven after her 2nd Q.

summonerschool,3e2lx4,Emeraldaes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I have it all wrong, but Riven is a strange champion. She has a monstrous game when 1v1 in a lane, but in team fights many other champions are just better.  To that end, perhaps it's better not to try and beat her in lane, but beat her in the context of the game?  For example, Maokai. You probably won't kill a good Riven. But in team fights you're about a million times more useful.  My current thinking is, if you don't feed her, you can win game and lose lane happily.  I was inspired to think like this after several matches VS her as Singed. Sure, early game she gave me a headache and i did give away 1 or 2 kills.  But late game? It was like Riven didn't exist. I just pressured the map and ignored her. She was dancing about spamming her stupid shield and I'm like, ""OK, love, I'm gonna take your tower and get all lanes pushing then."" She couldn't do shit to me.  Eh, that's my current understanding. It's probably wrong and you all hate me. ;_;"
summonerschool,3e2lx4,Karmoon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"I like maokai vs riven, mostly because, even if she is a little fed, the point and click snare is long enough for your team to blow her up."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,yace987,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Ex one trick poney Riven main here, I stopped blind picking her due to how weak the champion actually became.  I started spamming Hecarim with a lot of success. Here's my OP.GG, make sure to select ranked only. I think it's a relevant counterpick as it does quite well from lvl1 and it keeps doing better as the game goes by. It has also a way better roaming potential and has stronger impact in teamfights.  Hecarim is the main reason why I will never blind pick Riven.  Other counter picks include    Quinn, self explanatory, the true definition of nightmare lane. The champion is not even that bad afterwards in teamfights. She has to play very agressive in order to make the pick work and it's on your jungler to gank Gnar & Lissandra, if you perfectly play the kite game there's not much she can do. NB for Lissandra, she can still rush Mercs + Hexdrinker and deal with your CC but she won't have enough damage to kill you if you rush zhonya and play 21/9/0. If you play 21/0/9 and rush morello then the setup I mentionned for Riven may allow her to kill you. Teemo & Kennen, the level of annoyance is between Quinn and Gnar Fiora, she outsustains you, outduels you, outbursts you. Skill matchup that should be played with a swordmaster mind (play mind games / wait for her to engage and then use a cooldown window to retaliate. You fight both her mana and health bar). Other annoying picks (but much easier than people think) include Darius, Renekton, Garen and whatever champion that can rush armor and rely on base damage to hurt you more than you hurt them."

Survive lane till you get 1500 gold, buy chain vest + tear[or boots cloth if you can manage your mana really well] and the lane becomes a joke, even if you were going even until that point. Riven can't burst you down, and if she can't burst you she isn't going to kill you anytime soon due to E slowing Attack Speed.  If for some reason you can't survive that long even with flask pots(or cloth 5) just B at 1020 gold and buy vest+ cloth armor and you will still be a bitch do deal with.  You still deal respectable damage due to malphite's ridiculous base damages + W and E scaling with armor. Not to mention that as long as riven doesn't get fed early game, it's really hard for her to outscale a malphite.  It's really important that you force her shield into CD before using Q early to avoid wasting mana(easily done by activating W, using E and slapping her a bit whenever she forces trades) and that you make use of your passive, try not to give her an opportunity to trade when you have your shield down."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,KeonkwaiJinkwai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"I realize you mention Renekton as a standard counter. It's true but if you play Riven against a Renekton who has perfected the matchup, you will not want to lane against him after level 3 or 6.  Renekton is one of Riven's hardest melee matchups in my opinion. He has a long stun to interrupt her combo, he has heavy sustain, hie wave clear and roam potential is as strong as Riven's, and his early burst is among the highest in top lane. Starting W-->E-->Q on Renekton will absolutely ruin most aggressive melees and unwary ranged champions, and Riven is no different. Renekton can stun Riven level 1 if she advances with Q, and then at level 2, Renekton can stun and also disengage with E to take low damage if needed. With Q at level 3, Renekton can use either empowered Q or W (I prefer W unless I am lower HP than Riven and need a big sustain chunk) in his E auto W auto Q combo and just use E to back out again. It is important to note that starting W-->Q is sometimes stronger against melees who are naturally aggressive such as Riven. They'll come to you a lot of the time. But a good Riven will try to abuse the fact that you have no escape if she sees Q before level 3.   This matchup is really hard to play in as Riven simply because his stun breaks you and he has a gap closer on top of that. His sustain means he can still be competitive at level 3 even if he lost trades level 1 and 2. His ultimate means you have to do even more work for your execute to be effective. His ability to roam after hard clearing makes him a snowbally threat like Riven.  If he gets a kill in lane then he owns midgame and Riven will have to just rely on scaling. If Renekton goes offensive like a Yolo Queue master then he can still be competitive lategame."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,SkrillHDx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"Personally I like Nautilius against riven and find it to be a pretty good match up especially one you get armor items and she can't kill you but otherwise when she jumps on you, you can shield trade with autos and e and once she q's onto you all she has to try to get away is e since she will be slowed by your e and if she dashes you can hook. You probably won't kill the riven 1v1 in lane unless she messes up but she shouldn't really kill you."

Go into custom game and try to kill wolfs or raptors with just a Dorans Blade and Undertow. This is going to be your standard start. Teleport top with the Dorans Blade and 5 HP pots.  Once you are level 3 you should have 1 point in Q and 2 points in E. You are now ready to pop ghost, Q Riven and constantly E and auto attack her. You should be able to kill her even if she uses ignite. Just make sure you auto attack her all the time it's possible, because it deals tons of damage and shortens the CDR on your E. Olaf's E ( true damage ) out-ranges any of Riven's Abilities at 325. It's madness.  Standard build for me is double dorans into Ninja Tabi. I build The Black Clever because the MS synergizes with Olaf's Q. Throw your Q and the enemy and you'll run faster. Standard Randuins, Spirit Visage, Righteous Glory are all good items. I usually don't build more dmg, but Bork or Hydra can work in conjunction with TBC.  In team fights you go on a kamikazi move on their ADC."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,NOFREENAME,0,Tue Jul 21 15:10:54 2015 UTC,This is why he is the dunk master.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,2marston,3,Tue Jul 21 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"A sufficiently good Riven will basically never lose to Darius, and she becomes a lot more dangerous later on too.  Darius is great against Riven if he can force an extended trade or if he gets off free damage (eg. hitting her with his Q every time she gets close enough to farm), but Riven wins short trades, and her kit lets her handle pretty much anything Darius can do.  For example, Qing Riven works great for Darius if she isn't on the ball because it chunks her and she has no sustain. However, a really good Riven will see him coming, will shield the Q, will stun, will put down a bit of damage, and then will jump out of hook range. You can possibly catch her with E if she screwed up and didn't get out of range after using her stun, but that won't happen if she's very good. Also, she'll tend to keep her stun available for the hook, which means she'll beat you if you all-in, too.   So at that point, Darius can't poke because Riven will outtrade, can't initiate because Riven can, depending on the situation, either escape with ease or use it as a free opportunity to blow Darius up, and can't just play cautiously and outscale because a Riven with no kills at least has mobility and a stun whereas a Darius with no kills is a subpar bruiser with a somewhat useful hook.  Mind, Darius is probably the easiest counter in the world to Riven if she isn't so good, but at higher elo its likely that if you see a Riven, she knows exactly what to do when she sees a Darius (or a Garen, though Garen actually has the scaling and skills to not be totally outplayed by a Riven)."

summonerschool,3e2lx4,2marston,6,Tue Jul 21 14:12:30 2015 UTC,Not if she gets the slightest edge. Shen is only strong when he's ahead. Once you are behind you are fucked royally.
summonerschool,3e2lx4,NOFREENAME,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"And this is different from any other champion how? I've found Shen does just fine against Riven while being even. Outsustains early, gets too tanky for her to kill later and his taunt shuts her ass down in teamfights."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,2marston,4,Tue Jul 21 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"Shen doesn't have an ulti in lane. He also has fairly low mobility (E has a long cooldown). You will be zoned off your farm and murdered on the regular if she is even slightly ahead.   To be fair this is consistent with any immobile laners vs Riven, but Shen doesn't even have an ult to try fight her back when she dives him."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,NOFREENAME,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"This is true. If you get behind, you are screwed.  I have two problems with your argument tho:   To get behind, you have to get chunked by the enemy jungler. If 1. happened, there is not a single champion which can do fine vs Riven in this situation. If you are melee, you get zoned. If you are ranged, Riven can flash-engage and kill you."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,VassiliMikailovich,0,Tue Jul 21 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"Like I said in my other post, Shen doesn't have an ult in lane. This means at lvl 6 Riven gains a ton of power and Shen gains nothing tangible. She can and will dive and kill you pretty easily."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,hunkerd0wn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"This is simply not true.  You start the lane with cloth+5, 9-21-0 and armor yellows. You have 60 armor from the start, plus you will stay full health because of the pots.  There is no scenario in which Riven can kill you solo at level 6 with these stats, unless she has ignite plus you take more then a full rotation during her ult plus her ult and you already wasted e and flash so you can not escape this. She has no time to do this under your turret tho as it will kill her during this time. You can also buy a little time using w."
summonerschool,3e2lx4,2bloom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"Seems a bit dangerous to dive Shen, though.   Anyhow, while I haven't played the matchup, it seems like a sufficiently good Shen would benefit simply from his natural tankiness combined with that taunt. Riven does get a huge spike at 6 compared to Shen, but as I understand it, that spike is reliant on her basically landing either a full combo or most of it. Yet Shen can seriously cut down Riven's damage by landing a good taunt when she ults, ideally while running towards his turret."

Imo it's a losing matchup, somehow people have started maxing shield  against teemo but it's such a stupid thing to do since you want the Q burst for when you're blinded.

summonerschool,3e2lx4,anthropophage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:23 2015 UTC,Have you played him since his changes to W? His passive means after his first back he shows up to lane with over 130 armor.

summonerschool,3e2lx4,Goorag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"Glacial shroud is only 20 armor and passive is 10% at level 1. How exactly are you getting 130 armor on first back?

Riven will, however, outscale you, so theres not much you can do in that respect. The same goes with Irelia, you beat her until level 7-9, where she will be stronger and outscale you from that point on, unless you've gained a lead.

Use red trinket to scan the bush and remove wards, then place the pink ward out of the bush, so it looks like you accidentally misswarded.  People see red when they spot a pink, not even faker can resist killing one, just wait for someone to show up and get a free kill!"

Now if I were to try that I'd probably get heavily out traded to where it's not worth at all.   Any type of weird roaming can work in any elo. Soloq players are not on comms generally so there is poor communication. Same with just waiting in a pinked bush and getting a pick. The adc isn't going to blue trinket to help a support ward. The support is not going to go ward with the jungler so getting picks on a warding support is really easy no matter what elo you're in. Cheesy play in general can often work to your advantage. Invading with almost any comp, having your top lane sit in bot bush with your adc and support to get a pick on the adc.

Even if the team is behind, they will somehow make the decision to contest 2nd Drag and walk straight into your trap. It works better with Baron in my opinion, because teams (and junglers) generally will be extremely reluctant to give it up to the ennemy team without a fight or steal attempt, with good reason since it sometimes means the end of the game. You will usually see players either directly go to ward the pit, or timidly walk around anticipating skillshots until they feel the right time to drop a ward and gain vision of Baron's health.

People are more predictable in their actions (i.e. I see our bot is out of position, so I can predict a roam out of the enemy mid and catch him in deathbrush if I'm fast and sneaky) because they will usually make the right macro call. The can see the minimap and move accordingly, so if you take that into consideration based on what your enemy can see, you can get in their way and pick em off.  People also fall for DC bait initiation. Alistar is probably the biggest offender of this crap, but you can just go stand in a spot where you are a free kill while your team hides behind you out of vision, and just stand there. Give up like half your HP bar before ulting and wombo initiating with your team."

You see the enemy jungler top, so you (and your support) kill bot tier 1 tower, then you kill both the enemy bot laners with you living with plenty of health. You have Infinity Edge, Tier 1 boots, Zeal, 1 Health pot, and a pink ward in a random bush. With 1550 gold. What do you do?  *Edit - My Answer - Push Tier 2. Who cares about the gold you have when you killed bot and jungler was top side. Your completely safe to push. Dragon fine but it could possibly down and if the enemy jungler was top and you killed bot, I wouldn't be surprised if my jungler is being dumb and trying to roam all the way top to help.

summonerschool,3dz3o7,RCM94,14,Mon Jul 20 20:06:33 2015 UTC,Idk. If it's still early on their top might tp behind you while their mid and jungle roam when their bot respawns. The safest thing to do is clear gromp and blue if up and take drag.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Mrka12,3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:19 2015 UTC,I'm surprised I had to go this far down to see drag mentioned.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Elyou243,4,Tue Jul 21 04:47:15 2015 UTC,Yah lower elos tend to ignore them... 1 3 and 5 are really important.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Kwantuum,4,Tue Jul 21 04:53:15 2015 UTC,I'd also say 4 is really important just because it puts a clock on the game as 5 dragons is pretty much game over barring some insane misplays/outplays.  If you see them having drake number 3 you're really going to want to at least get the timer on 4th.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,KnowBrainer,9,Tue Jul 21 13:13:16 2015 UTC,Take tier 2 tower. You'll either get it for free or force mid to rotate and get his own turret damaged and you may even force a TP from the toplaner. You're in a 2v0 that at worst can turn into a 2v2 since 2 of them are dead and the jungler doesn't run TP and was just seen top.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,ButtnakedSoviet,14,Mon Jul 20 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to take a tier 2 tower in the span of a death timer as a 1-item ADC/Sup 2-man siege. There's not enough minions to support my DPS? I'd check dragon, take it if possible (drop aggro on dragon and kill their mid if they rotate through river) and then fall back, collecting krugs, red, and raptors then posting up mid to see how the battlefield settles. If enemy ADC shows in bot, I B and go back bot to catch the wave. If they show anywhere else, I'm already in the center of the map, easy travel times."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,kanashika,3,Tue Jul 21 03:10:11 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it has to do with your champs.  Playing a corki/janna lane? Probably won't get that turret.  Jinx/thresh? Might as well try especially with all the protection included in the jinx/thresh kit.

summonerschool,3dz3o7,CommunistElk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:08 2015 UTC,I would roam mid if the enemy mid has backed/is dead/has little wave clear and their tier 1 turret is up. Otherwise I would probably just back and then go mid/bot.

You can continue pushing bot and get damage on a second tier tower, ward up their jungle and take buffs, take dragon, or try and rotate to take mid tower depending on how the map is looking.  With 1550 gold... you'd probably end up just upgrading boots and buying a crit cloak or something, so it's not a massive powerspike like backing for a PD would be.

The dead bot laners might have re-sprawn by the time you pushed to tower. enemy mid might roam bot to help. enemy top might tele behind you on a ward. If drake is up, take drake with my jungler. If not, deep ward their bot jungle and take their jungle camps. Go mid and help push tower."

summonerschool,3dz3o7,REkTeR,14,Mon Jul 20 19:45:59 2015 UTC,I probably dont do this but buy mobi boots and 2 wards then ward enenmy jgler deep ^
summonerschool,3dz3o7,1thenumber,9,Mon Jul 20 19:52:06 2015 UTC,This is partially correct. Since you have technically 'won' your lane you have created the opportunity to roam. Your ADC has a couple kills and the enemy botlane is behind. The wards are needed for your adc to have vision when you roam to mid. You buy the mobis to apply pressure in midlane. When you have enough pressure in mid and bot you can secure dragon and then bot and mid turret.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,TheShadowKick,4,Mon Jul 20 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"Question: is this still your move when you expect your adc to be playing at a ""low"" level? So for example you expect that your adc will not roam or is likely to die in a 2v1 lane while you roam mid."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,MissPetrova,11,Mon Jul 20 21:56:02 2015 UTC,"Not a high elo player here, but if you watch an LCS support streamer, like aphromoo,  you'll notice that the worse his ADC is, the more he roams.  Basically, if your ADC can't even figure out how to play a 2v1 or even 1v1, then why stick around bot lane when you can help get mid or top or jungle fed.  If he doesn't know how to position, what makes you think he is going to win you the game?   I'm mid gold elo and a support main, and I cannot believe how many games I have won after me and the ADC got dumpstered, followed by me just roaming the rest of the game."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,TheShadowKick,6,Tue Jul 21 04:23:09 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't know how to position, what makes you think he is going to win you the game?    It's not about him winning you the game, it's about the enemy ADC winning his team the game.  I've played with many, many teams that can't handle a fed ADC on the other team. If my ADC is going to end up feeding while I roam that can cost us the game."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,sureyouken,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:56 2015 UTC,If that's the case it's better for the ADC to feed than to have to deal with repeated double kills because the ADC keeps doing stupid shit and getting both of you killed.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Tostiraptor,2,Tue Jul 21 07:54:35 2015 UTC,"In many cases it's not the ADC being a feeder, it's the ADC not knowing how to survive 2v1 in lane while the support is off roaming."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,CommunistElk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:02:49 2015 UTC,Where do we place the two wards? Any optimal places or is it just wherever we guess traffic to happen?
summonerschool,3dz3o7,BoatWizard,2,Tue Jul 21 04:01:40 2015 UTC,"Low ELO support main here - everything below is probably effective, but not necessarily optimal.  I would actually get two stealth wards and a vision ward here. Place a stealth ward on the enemy jungler's exit near bot (the ramp opposite dragon on blue side, tribush on red side), pink ward his exit near mid (behind enemy blue buff on red side, the bush behind dragon pit on blue side). For the last stealth ward, either try to put it onto the enemy botside buff, or try to get it into the jungle behind enemy tower (enemy tribush on blue side, the corridor near krugs on red side) so you're safer when you inevitably try to take enemy turret."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,kanashika,13,Tue Jul 21 11:36:16 2015 UTC,I guess I would buy sightstone and boots since I am an engage support and top myself off with potions??  EDIT: Gave my answer before checking other people's... I guess I was off :< Mobis would be a better buy to push our lead further even more. This is an awesome thread!
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Huu7,4,Mon Jul 20 20:46:05 2015 UTC,"Neither answer is technically right or wrong, it depends on the situation.  If you didn't take dragon yet because your jungler was top and theirs was still up, that means a dragon fight is probably coming soon.  Having the extra combat stats is nice if the fight is coming soon, and you don't really have to worry about sunk money on wards.    If you were to buy mobis and the ruby crystal for combat stats, you don't get the wards/can't switch to red trinket.  If you go mobis + wards, you don't have the combat stat advantage.  It really depends on what you expect to happen in the next minute or two of the game."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Drasern,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"first back, purchase sightstone, swap warding trinket thing for lens sweeper make sure river is warded. Check blue and red timer and see if enemy jungler has recently shown himself. If so then put in deep ward in opposite side of jungle. If deep ward no, then check mid to see if they are in position for a friendly gank."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,DrakeXIV,5,Mon Jul 20 19:58:48 2015 UTC,"Buying sightstone is a good and safe alternative, but if you really want to have some saying in a solo queue game you should buy mobis. It's a bit risky, but if you know what you're doing its worth every penny."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Angormus,8,Mon Jul 20 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"but if you know what you're doing its worth every penny.   Ok, but clearly i don't know what I'm doing, because I'm in bronze. So if you do go for mobi's in this situation, what should you be trying to do? I assume you're picking up wards as well, which means chucking some wards in river/enemy jungle. But when you walk back to lane you have exactly 0 combat stats."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,JustCallMeFrij,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"The idea is that with the enemy bot lane gone, you can their lack of presence to influence other lanes. You can afford to do this since you don't need to be in lane if the enemy laner is not there.  By getting Mobis, it allows you to roam to other lanes and support them, be it by ganking them or just warding for them (just river wards for solo laners or deep wards for the jungle).  This works because you now have the speed to travel between lanes much more efficiently and can turn 1v1 situations into your favor by turning them into 2v1 (e.g. Blitz running into lane and hooking enemy midlaner)."

Running up and back with mobis while not doing or taking minion damage/harass can safely zone both players by yourself so long as you stay in your adc's zone of influence.  Mind you, this is after you've utilised your speed to deep ward their jungle and gank mid."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Failbomber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:54 2015 UTC,Thanks! I will consider that next time :).
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Kwantuum,4,Mon Jul 20 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are: Mobility boots and ruby crystal, then attempt a gank on either mid or top.  Logic:   We're quite a few seconds (15ish including base regen time) ahead of our ADC in terms of if we were to go back to the lane, so there's no point in doing this. Also the lane is fully shoved, so no need to soak up XP/gold. We don't know anything about the enemy jungler's position, so we could be setting ourselves up for a dangerous spot if we go into their jungle to ward, especially because for deep wards, we could be surrounded by the enemy bot lane (since they're only dead for 10 more seconds) and the mid lane if we are spotted. Also this is inefficient gold use for stealth wards when we are going to have sightstone before too long."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,klody25,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:54:46 2015 UTC,You put yourself out of vision if you go mobi and crystal. In high elos jungler tend to swap trinket with red. trinket wards dont provide enough vision. You open yourself to ganks. If you try to roam you risk your adc getting dived and killed by 3. If you want to go mobi just get 2 wards and some potions. Ward river before going roam.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Huu7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:45:15 2015 UTC,"bad at support, but I'd probably get sightstone, swap trinket, upgrade gold income item and go put a few deep wards in bot side jungle since I'll be there before their botlane, and just head back to lane and arrive bot a few seconds after my adc and around the time that their botlane shows up."

summonerschool,3dz3o7,wabal,8,Tue Jul 21 09:44:09 2015 UTC,"You are playing Jarvan jungle and you're ganking an even toplane at level 4 through river; your top is a rumble and their top is a  maokai, both have everything up and are full HP. Maokai  (red side) is pushed up pretty far. How do you execute the gank?"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,MacGyver_15,5,Mon Jul 20 21:06:44 2015 UTC,"Run up to Mao from river bush, wait for him to use his Q and/or flash before Flagging and Dragging to knock him up and stay on him. Rumble follows him with flamespitter on and uses harpoon between flags to continually slow him once we're past his minion wave.  Since we're staying behind Maokai as he runs back to his turret, he essentially has only 2 abilities because he can't use twisted advance as that would only bring him further from safety.  How'd I do?"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,wabal,10,Mon Jul 20 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"I would try to stay closer in front of him, so the knock back is not as strong. Also don't group close for knockup. I would use the shield slow first when walking up to make harpoon easier to hit."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,MacGyver_15,4,Mon Jul 20 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"I think you did well though you're not trusting rumble enough. I'd wait in the river brush, ping rumble. If he understands you he'll walk up past the minion wave and pretend to trade. At this point maokai either uses abilities on him or he realises he's getting ganked and backs off. We assume he's good and knows he's getting ganked. At this point you start walking up to him but you stay to the side of him and not in front of him. Because rumble is pretty close and there are no minions he can easily land 2 danger zone harpoons and a full q, especially because you shield for the slow and start autoing. You stand slightly in front of maokai (move between auto's) and have EQ up. Maokai will be getting low but he can't escape because you can still EQ when you're snared. His best bet is to Q flash away to create more distance. It depends if rumble is in range or not but maybe he can flash after him for overheat auto's and a danger zone Q to kill him. If maokai doesn't q flash in time j4 can throw EQ in a line where he thinks Mao might flash to(predict where his mouse is by his movements). If the knockup hits, rumble can q+overheat auto him to death maybe using flash. You might need to flash in order to hit EQ, but consider if this is worth. Else the only way out is for Mao to follow your EQ with W which is hard to pull off.   If at the very start of the gank maokai does fall for the bait and uses either q or w you can easily chase him down the lane to kill him. By waiting a split second you're giving rumble a chance to get close to maokai which really helps you."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,wabal,2,Tue Jul 21 05:24:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explaination!   I hadn't ever thought to predict the flash by watching his movements. It's obviously not a perfect way to predict it, but it's better than nothing. I'll have to try that."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,ScoopJr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:49 2015 UTC,It's more of a safety net in this case So that if he flashes you still knock him up. This is also another reason to DI; it makes your movements and skillshots less predictable.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,2marston,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:31 2015 UTC,DI?
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Failbomber,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:35 2015 UTC,DI'ing is clicking close to yourself at a high rate. This explains it pretty well.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,kingjoedirt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:15 2015 UTC,I'd wait for Maokai to use his W then as i walk up for the gank i ping Rumble to know that i am going in.  I walk up to auto as Maokai walks back and hopefully Q's me and then as he gets a little farther away after he Q's me i E->Q and he should either be trapped and left with low health if not dead or used his flash to get away.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,JuventusX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"If he didn't use his W, come in from the side angle behind him and don't give him vision until you have to (he can W to you as an escape if you come from directly behind). Stay between him and his tower as much as possible, using redbuff if you have it for the slow, as well as your W.  You could hopefully be able to save E-Q until after he flashes. If he manages to get away from you, use E-Q anyway to force the flash. If you made him use flash without using your E-Q, it's a kill if you land it."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,DoucheBagMcSwagPants,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:09:20 2015 UTC,That wont work since the lane heavily pushed mao will try to poke with only Q the W will be up till the lane is in balance. If he can react to EQ of you he will run away. Since his Q is on lower cd. He can get rid of you. You need to say rum le to commit. Either mao runs or commits. He can't tun away from W slow and harpoon slows no matter which spell he uses. You need add rumble to equation for gank to be successful.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,bballspike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:59:35 2015 UTC,"Walk up for shield slow. Rumble should be able to get a harpoon or two before or after that slow. If he flashes, follow with flag and drag. Tricky part is do I kite in front of him and let him advance to me, or do I follow behind him and let him knock me back out of aa range. I most likely don't pay any attention to that and just mindlessly auto attack him."

EDIT: You are playing a losing matchup, someone like Vayne or Twitch. Your support is thresh, but you can't rely on him to do anything useful. Draven's support is someone passive, like Janna."

summonerschool,3dz3o7,bballspike,9,Mon Jul 20 19:53:04 2015 UTC,Use his axes to land skill shots. He either eats the skill shots or drops his axes. Once he has no axes you can trade with him. Rinse and repeat until he is OOM.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,xsavarax,9,Mon Jul 20 19:47:12 2015 UTC,"Any decent draven can catch using the very edge. Honestly this method is pretty overrated. The best answer is to try to farm under turret because a draven will either have to push to keep axes up or lose them every once in a while. Wait for jungle ganks, never dive a big minion wave. Never try to force, if you miss your engage even 3 v 2 do not continue."

summonerschool,3dz3o7,JuventusX,5,Mon Jul 20 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"that would highly depend on what I'm playing, what adc / support I'm playing with, and what support Draven has. Better edit with more info."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,DoucheBagMcSwagPants,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"Support is my go to after top and jungle so I'm not too knowledgeable about the situation. But uh I'd hope my ADC has long range like Caitlyn or Tristana. Then my supports are usually protectors/cc meat shields (Braum, Nautilus, Alistar) so in a lane like that I'd really need a perfect opportunity to engage on Draven (dependent on his support I suppose though). I can eat his ult with Braum I believe so I'd keep an eye open for that. Try to disengage as much as possible. If Draven goes BT first then don't look for short trades, its pointless. He doesn't have much disengage other then that displacement and speed boost so winning the vision control of the river could help end up in an easy kill. This is very broad cause there's not a lot of information to go on here. If Draven has an engage support like Leona I'd try to counter pick it with Alistar. When he is going to catch an axe sometimes you can force him to miss with some poke he can't respond to like if you use Braums Q where the axe is gonna land while backing off. He's scary in lane but in teamfights he has to get fairly close to attack anyone but the tanks so I can easily use my CC on him or literally just stand in his way with my shield up as Braum. Which is pretty hilarious. Right ideas here?"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,ClutchPedal,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a newer ADC so I'll give it a shot.   Try to focus on farm, outscale, and not give him a kill Avoid early trading Trade with him when his axes are down Try to get him to drop his axes by aiming skillshots (I guess this is easier if you're playing support - I'm a support main and I might pick Nami into Draven) Call for ganks before he can get a kill   Please make corrections and add on if I'm missing anything :)"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,d1ngd0ngkid,5,Mon Jul 20 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, Draven level 1 isn't that good, you can trade that early as almost any ADC. ESPECIALLY if you can make him drop his axe with a CC at level 1.  DO NOT. I repeat DO NOT fight him once he gets a BF. You will lose, even if up 2/0 or 3/0."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,ClutchPedal,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"You should also try to counter push when he pushes, but that's pretty much it, besides the part where you out scale Draven."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,cibohphobic,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"From my experience playing draven: Particularly as vayne and twitch, you have opportunities to mess with his axes if he tries to go in. As vayne, q into range if need be, aa, e him away from an axe in the air, bonus points for into a wall. As twitch, the area on your w is large enough so that draven can't catch his axe on the edge of it.   But as a generic weak-early adc, let him push because he really has to with his axes, and farm under tower, and hopefully your jungler realizes the great possible gank. Essentially, don't fall too far behind in farm or get killed, and you're fine, because draven needs to get ahead in lane, and you'll do well going even.  Feel sorry for the poor soul that got a janna when they're playing draven"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,JuventusX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, I like getting Janna as Draven. The shield helps with getting favourable trades in lane, especially with your axe scaling. I know she's not normally an aggressive support, but the peeling potential means you can stay in lane safe and it stops the opponent going aggressive on you. That's kind of important with Draven's lack of mobility. And Janna is great at saving you when you're going too ham."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,cibohphobic,2,Tue Jul 21 08:34:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense. Yeah, I can see that it would let you play more aggressively at the same danger level... I'll have to try it out!"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,2marston,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:08 2015 UTC,I would avoid trading as Vayne until BOTRK and then look to 1v1 him and take advantage of his mid game trough.
summonerschool,3dz3o7,ADrunkPanda60,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"I would not. Even after you complete botrk, if he can manage to not get stunned you WILL lose a 1v1. His mid game is actually very good, even more so if ahead.  If you can stun him while 1 or both of his axes are in the air, then you might be able to kill him./"

summonerschool,3dz3o7,ButtnakedSoviet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:14 2015 UTC,Draven doesn't have a power trough. He is a beast from lvl 2 onwards. His Achilles heal is his lack of mobility/escapes and extreme weakness to hard cc.   He is also a little bit reliant on snowballing due to not having a passive until he gets kills.

If I'm vayne and can get a wallbang at level 6, go all in and win the lane.  edit: also, try to push against him as hard as I can, draven players usually spam auto attacks because muh stacks, and if I let him push the lane to tower I will take too much harass under tower."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Nutzutin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:44:06 2015 UTC,Yes. Getting pushed into tower against draven is one of the worst thing you can do. It gives him free farm and passive ramp and he can easily harass user tower.

summonerschool,3dz3o7,Nutzutin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:32 2015 UTC,Unless you're Renekton/Aatrox/Maokai just farming your lane would mean a free tower for opposing team.

Drop a ward definitely in the jungle bush by my outer tower. Possibly another one in a jungle entrance, maybe by blue buff or by the bush next to mid tower so I can see if Shaco comes to dive me. If my jungler and I can kill Singed and I can find out where Shaco is, possibly just try and freeze the lane until jungle can come up. If we can't kill Singed, go try and gank mid, tele bot, or get a dragon, win objectives elsewhere on the map so that Singed farming is irrelevant."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,buckwheat1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"All towers are still up, but since Singed is proxying, your tower is hurt. (let's say 2/5ths health left). Freezing lane isn't an option since the minions are walking straight to tower. Don't forget that Singed would probably also have tp up to contest objectives.  EDIT: Freezing is an option if you have very good sustain and clear (someone like renekton), mb."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,DreyX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, freezing would only work if you are someone tanky who can soak up the damage.  I'd probably just abandon my tower and force objectives elsewhere, if possible. If that wasn't possible I have no idea."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,buckwheat1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"What I would do is hold on to my tower until buffs have been cleared (since they're respawning), ask the jungler to ward dragon when clearing bottom side buff and come gank Singed. If you abandon your tower, you have to be sure that you can get something back, that being another tower or dragon."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,MadEorlanas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"Farm near your tower and ask your jungler to help provide some relief either with a ward or being near topside so he can turn anything that's about to happen. If singed is at the 13 minute mark he probably isn't terribly strong, but then again neither are you, depending on if he took ghost, which he probably did, he most likely will get away, they have a shaco so chasing becomes very dangerous. Shaco needs to appear somewhere or some sort of help will have to come to releave the pressure top.  If I have teleport I will try to hold my lane near tower and get as much farm as possible, maybe using teleport to get back to lane if I'm low. I also don't want to get dove by a ignite shaco, so I'll probably back before I get too low. when I back Ill get item's and a pink ward, probably not level 9 yet, so no sweepers just yet, but it's on the radar."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,salocin097,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:59 2015 UTC,Diamond IV here.  You are absolutely correct about warding. Shaco can outplay himself if you ward properly in your jungle/river. Singed will farm between your T1 and T2 turrets. Try to spot the Shaco when he comes to dive and tell what will happen to your midlaner/jungler so you can make  2v1 dive into 2v3 dive into your favor.

summonerschool,3dz3o7,ardeaf,10,Mon Jul 20 19:48:04 2015 UTC,"Well caitlyn Needs to win lane because she's normally outshined by other ADC's in 5v5 (vayne, jinx, draven). If you are playing against cait dont be too aggresive. Farm up and dont push the lane so she can't zone you. Try to freeze the lane so you don't get ganked and set your jungler up for easy ganks."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,smartwon,7,Mon Jul 20 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"This is the most effective route to beating Caitlyn -- by going even in CS and not dying.  Setting up jungle ganks works wonders as well.  Even though she has disengage it isn't the most reliable and if she's harassing you as she should, inevitably the minions will pushed to your turret and you will be 100% safe and she will be 100% screwed."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Flippy_Tippy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:29 2015 UTC,"Ya pretty much if you're even on items against cait when coming out of laning phase, you've basically won lane."

summonerschool,3dz3o7,Sertii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:07:44 2015 UTC,"If the minions are pushed to your turret you can fairly easily get a pretty solid freeze right in front, especially if she's trying to poke again"

The buffs to her passive and ult sure did help but still by comparison to vayne, jinx, sivir, trist....she is pretty underwhelming after laning phase which is why she needs to get ahead early to remain effective."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,kanashika,2,Tue Jul 21 03:55:41 2015 UTC,Caitlyn has a very strong 3/4 item spike depending on the game. Don't underestimate the power of a well positioned Caitlyn in late game. You're right when it comes to mid game though since she can solely rely on her autos.

summonerschool,3dz3o7,MadEorlanas,3,Mon Jul 20 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Might work but if you attack her that means you'll have to get close she might just E you in the middle of her creep wave.  Suddenly you're slowed  in the middle of a creep wave while the ranged creep wail on you and she's even farther away and probably coming right back to shoot your ass  But if you can make it work (lessening the amount of creep you're getting into, or getting behind the creep wave so they don't aggro onto you) then yes harass might work if you and your support can reliably punish her with too much retaliation.  I'm thinking if you're playing jinx/naut and they are playing cait/janna. Hook in, chompers, nautilus burst or whatever, naut shield + walk away, you fire a few rockets and walk away when she E's out.  If she doesn't E out because it's on CD then you could probably outright kill her if you play it right, especially if you just spotted the enemy jungler top side."

Shove the wave to Caitlyn's tower, where she's forced to spend mana to CS, and then fall back. Caitlyn's under tower farming is abysmal due to no AS steroid and low base AS, and she can't fight you when she has no minions. Bonus points if you're blue side. If you're Sivir, you will always win the war of attrition because playing against Caitlyn means you basically get infinite mana"

The other answers worked more for me, and that is just don't let her completely shut you down in lane and you've pretty much ""won"" vs. Cait.  If she doesn't shut you down then you will do much more than she will mid game and can snowball that into a monster late game.  You might do well to just let your jungler help the other lanes and let him know that you're giving up laning phase playing safe.  (Unless you know her flash/heal is down and your jungler can get onto her reliably either because river isn't warded or you have great engage a la Sivir, Rengar, Nautilus)"

Realize that you have the luxury of playing a computer game while many other people in the world struggle to have a decent quality of life. If you are playing games it's because you have free time which is the best thing we can have as people. LOL is just a game. Sometimes it's hard to see that, but in reality there are things much more important and meaningful. You getting mad about a video is not worth it. Just have a laugh, dont argue with the troll.

summonerschool,3dz3o7,chu12ch,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:04 2015 UTC,"Wards wards wards. Try and get your team to buy wards, you should be any chance you get, and pop them down in the enemy jungle/river and then PRESSURE. Push lanes, look for picks. Keep moving forward s best you can.  Obviously this is dependent on team comps as some will want to fight or make picks or whatever, but ultimately you want to be pressuring objectives and vision is KEY to doing that."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,ardeaf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:06:08 2015 UTC,"Shove mid with your team as 5, because if you have 3 towers and dragon at 20 minutes, you're quite ahead and should have hit your 1st item powerspike. In this scenario, you force enemy champions mid to defend, and if they ever send someone to split push, you can trade T2 tower mid for T1 tower bot or top. Your primary job is to clear waves mana efficiently and provide poke on the tower, and DPS anyone who tries to engage or gets caught. You pray that the support/jungler has down enough wards to protect you. You continue this until dragon spawns, and then take it or force a team fight there since you're so far ahead. Once mid T2 is down, you can rinse wash repeat and collect more objectives and snowball, or deviate into split pushing once objectives are gone."

summonerschool,3dz3o7,nuketesuji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:11 2015 UTC,Either A) Rotate with anywhere from 3-4 members of your team top and take care of them and then use the advantage to push or take an objective  or B) Try to force a teamfight and win a 4v5 then outpush them
summonerschool,3dz3o7,henrebotha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:42:52 2015 UTC,"Option A is only good if there's no objectives on the opposite side of the map, otherwise at worst you lose map control and objectives while letting tryndamere get away."

Do you take inhib + its turret or baron?  Assumes both teams have equal scaling and you can get out safely.  Personally I would take the inhib, cause I can then use the pressure for baron.  Modifiyable Factors: Which Inhibitor, # of team mates up"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Kalysus,2,Tue Jul 21 08:00:13 2015 UTC,"i'd take baron because that way you completely shut'em down.  If you take inhib then get aced in the next fight, they take baron so they can get YOUR inhib with the baron buff.  If you take baron then get aced, they can only push lanes and since you used your baron to hard push they can't really take any objectives.  Plus taking inhib turret is easy with the baron buff."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Omnilatent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:52:13 2015 UTC,If you don't got siege potential and enemy has waveclear baron buff wont be enough to take the tower. This question is vague it is mid game/mid-late/late game. You have enough minion or hp to take tower etc. But taking tower and inhib means you have always a pushing lane for 3 min. You need to work on that more than a baron buff. One person should always go to clear those minions  you can use that thing to advantage to push and get another tower and inhib and it crumbles like that.

Both your team and the enemy team are about to head into a teamfight. The enemy team includes a Xin Zhao, Fiora, and Leona. The three are looking to all-in your carry. CDR is already maxed and your skills are up. However, your friendly Yasuo is close behind but you have a bad feeling that your carry will get jumped on as soon as the fight starts. You know that you have ONE shot at this because if your team doesn't follow up (especially Yasuo), then you could be in big trouble. Let us also assume that your teammates aren't that good.  What do you do? Do you pull the trigger and proc Yasuo's ult and hope that all goes well or protect your carry and have him/her deal free hits on the enemy while you protect him/her?"

You plan to take the top tower as it has ~50% hp. The enemy laner has respawned and you have enough time to take the tower. your tower is sill standing. how do you effectively take the tower without giving the enemy laner a slight ""comeback""?"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,captain_dux,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:11 2015 UTC,"I will not take the tower down myself, proxy farm and let as many minions die to it as possible before taking it down.  I think not letting the tower die is also a valid option when you can beat your enemy over and over again without having the danger of having to go deeper into enemy territory"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,KilluaShi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  I'd guess that I'd smack the tower a few times and let as much of my wave die to it and the next enemy wave as possible, putting more damage on the tower myself if the enemy top has good wave clear and less if their waveclear sucks. If I'm low, then I'll probably back immediately after that, but if I have a good amount of HP I'll look to pressure the map elsewhere with TP (assuming I don't have ignite/some other summoner).   Edit: If I can't make a good play with TP, I'll back, buy and regen, and then depending on the matchup, tp to lane or to to the minion that's tanking the enemy tower. For instance, if I'm playing Renekton vs. Dr. Mundo, then I'll teleport onto my minion, chunk him for a good portion of his health and probably eat 1-2 tower shots, and then back off to safety. If I'm playing Riven vs. Maokai, then I'll probably just tp onto my tower and hope my luck continues."
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Omnilatent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:46 2015 UTC,"i wouldnt back in that situation even with ~400 hp because i have vision on the river and the tribush. If i did back tho, i wouldnt tp on a minion (assuming i cant make a good tp play) as it is often a waste. for example the tp could be used for splitpushing and joining your team on drake. By tping on a minion, you lose a lot of map presence. Only tp to your own lane tower if the enemy is pushing in to not lose too much xp. i hope my advice helped you. I apologize for my english, its not my main language"
summonerschool,3dz3o7,Hau-degen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"So basically what you're saying is that I should just try and force a play somewhere on the map with teleport? It just feels really risky, especially since I don't know how good vision control is near dragon and if we have tabs on where the enemy jungler is. You're totally right, though - wasting tp to get to lane faster is probably not worth it when planning ahead for the next few fights around the map."

summonerschool,3e1xdn,Xinotine,3,Tue Jul 21 10:19:13 2015 UTC,You should try playing mostly ADC. You do great as ADC. Although you haven't got into ranked yet so you still want to keep trying different positions and champions. Try buying a pink ward every now and then. They can help so much. Even playing as ADC having a pink ward in tri or dragon put can give so much information and even save you a couple times.
summonerschool,3e1xdn,Cranzia,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:06 2015 UTC,"Make sure that you use your advantages once your in ranked. When you have an advantage in bot lane, try and use it to your advantage to take drag or their turret. After you take their turret, you can continue pushing their lane up to their tower and attempt to put some pressure there. Make sure to ask your support or upgrade your own trinket to ward up their jungle so you can continue to push. This pressure allows for other lanes to free up. You can also use your advantage to come help mid to take their tower, however you should only do this if their botlane is pressured and pushed up to their tower. Don't just group up mid randomly contesting cs with your midlaner for no reason unless it means you can take their mid tower. Um also make sure to cs. Lastly, even games when you're ahead of your lane mate by quite a bit try and continue to cs. Also the best advice I learned to get out of bronze was that League of legends isnt Call of duty. Its not team deathmatch and kills are not a big deal as you think. Use kills to pressure lanes and take objectives instead of a time to back. See u in challenjour m8"

That is also partly why I am now picking jungle over mid, even though I feel I do fairly well with Ahri.   By going jungle I kinda eliminate last hitting, and can better play to my strength."
summonerschool,3e1xdn,clykke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't even look at estimated MMR.   Looking back at your games the ones you've lost in the past have been at the TOP or slightly higher than the other average MMR in your games.  You've got to figure out why you're losing those games and fix that problem.   I actually had the same thing happen to me and only started climbing when I figured out how to win games that were at the high end of my MMR.  Mainly, this was through using champions that could control objectives and take towers early (part of the reason I main Diana).  As a jungler this might mean making sure that anytime you successful convert a gank you think about objectives you can take.  Push lane, take a tower.  Take a dragon, take a tower, the enemy blue, then dragon.  Being able to link objectives to kills is one of the things Silver players don't do compared to high Gold / Plat players."
summonerschool,3e1xdn,Jekarti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's one of the things I actually feel I am doing better than the average silver player. Taking objectives after kills, but am I also well aware that I can improve alot on all fronts. I guess I am not focusing enough on dagon/enemy buffs when jungling. I'll keep that in mind from now on.   Also, I really like Diana as a champion, but have come to the conclusion that strong pre level 6 ganks are key at my level. I can't trust my lanes to play safe until I get my ultimate, and often it is too late by then. Hence why I play Xin in the jungle now. His level 3 ganks are pretty strong imo.   Besides my CS'ing I kinda think another problem is the lack of a reliable tank jungler/top that I can play well. I just can't seem to find one that suits me. Any suggestions? I've tried Volibear, but often end up being kited.   Thank you for your input, it is appreciated."
summonerschool,3e1xdn,clykke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're right on point about Diana jungle.  I dont' think she's great in solo q because teammates can't wait around until you're six.  They will die twice, tilt, and make your life hell.  Xin is a much better choice.  As for tanks top I'd check out Sion if you want to be a bully and WuKong if you want more damage and high team fight influence.  Malphite is also solid along with Nasus but they are a bit less influential early game which is again a problem with solo q."
summonerschool,3e1xdn,Jekarti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:32 2015 UTC,"I like wukong, and actually looked into maining him, because he is quite flexible (top/jungle/mid). He is my go top laner, and backup jungler. The only problem I have with wukong is his lack of CC pre lvl 6. I think that hurts his jungling (ganks).   Malphite is a good suggestion for a tanky toplaner. I've had some succes the few times I've played him. I just don't think he is a very good jungler, and would prefer a champion that can go both top and jungle to reduce my pool. I am thinking maokai or maybe jarvan. Both seem to be relevant even as tanks. Not sure how they are right now though.   I've considered nasus. I've learned the hard way that he is able to carry hard in low elo."
summonerschool,3e1xdn,clykke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:09 2015 UTC,"I think Maokai is a bit weaker out of the jungle than Wu or Jarven.  Then again he's a super tank top.  Jarven can be very flexible in that he does well as a damage ""assassin,"" but can also build tank.  He's also a lane bully.  I'd say he has a bit less team fight influence that Wu but stronger skirmish potential with his flag and drag / ultimate.  Malphite I wouldn't mess with in the jungle.  Jarven sounds like a solid pick and I would experiment with Mao in some normals.  I think Mao is awesome he just doesn't bully enough for my tastes so I would stay away from him for a solo q environment."

Played a few bot games recently as I bought new champs, theres also a few aram games there. The Vayne, lb and Cait games were all first time games, i got the bundle the other day.  I main top lane playing Gnar/Irelia/Maokai. Gnar is probably my favorite champion at the moment. Recently channged how i build him from BC>Mercs>Randuins  vs AD to BC>Mercs>Mallet. Which i feel gives me more of an impact in tf's early on. Vs ap I would build hex first and then follow the same path.  I used to play support a lot and at the moment prefer to play Morg/Braum. When playing morg i try and focus a lot on getting deep vision on bot side jungle, getting a pink to protect mid and ganking mid with a Q-ult if i can.

Ideally you 100-0 one of their squishier champions with one spell rotation, so you don't really need that extra CDR. Then hopefully your team cleans up.

Other suggestions are eve cheese start red then gank mid, or run a devourer jungle like shyvana and just win with damage.   I think seju has fallen off, if you like supportive junglers there's nunu.

summonerschool,3e1xdn,shadowsoze,2,Tue Jul 21 13:14:14 2015 UTC,"Not sure how to help carry games besides keep everyone alive   That's already not a bad start. You might want to consider getting a Mikael's Crucible before Aegis though, because its active acts as an extra Heal + Cleanse on your designated target (I usually use it if my adc or mid-laner get caught and still have a chance of being saved), and the Crucible gives you much-needed cooldown reduction, especially since you scarcely ever get Ionian boots.  I find Crucible has more utility than Aegis/Locket early on, because of the Cleanse mainly, and coupled with the Talisman active and your E, it can facilitate escapes pretty easily. In some games you've gotten Ninja Tabis or Mercury treads as Soraka; I would advise you stick with boots of Mobility or Ionian boots - if you need armor, get a Frozen Heart (saved me from a bunch of Caitlyn ults and Vayne AAs). I usually don't build much AP (trying to keep team alive sometimes doesn't allow you the luxury of getting any), but smart move getting Rylai's on Soraka; all your offensive spells slow enemies. That, and Censer's are my go-to AP items on banana-chan. I used to get deathcap back in Bronze but the team's mistakes are deadlier in Silver and so gold is better spent in utility IMO.  Just my 2 cents. :)"

I have a tendency to just call fill in champ select the moment there is conflict and don't really feel like I ""main"" anything now.  Champs I feel I'm good with by role (ADC > Jungle/Support > Top > Mid preference):  -Top: Cho, Wu  -Jungle: Any of the recent cinderhulk junglers (and any other S tier) - Gragas, Sej, Naut. Been trying out Nocturne and REALLY like him.  -Mid: ... no one. Cho if available, otherwise I always tell myself to just pick Orianna... but mentally forget and lock in some random mid laner or Morgana.  -ADC: Cait, Trist, Jinx. Caitlyn by far is my best adc. I like Trist but haven't played her much. Jinx... I get why she's really good, but I just never put good games together on her. (I struggle a lot on champs without mobility it seems)  -Support:  Morg, Thresh, Janna. I'm comfortable on many more, but almost always default to those 3 unless someone requests someone specific. I feel I play a really solid Janna, but I'm something like 2-5 and no matter how many plays I [feel that I] make for my team I feel like I'm at the mercy of my ADC and team. She's the kind of champ I feel I could play in a 5 man premade and be fantastic, but in solo queue it just doesn't matter how I play.  I'm stuck in the mentality that you can't carry from support (I know you can, but I'll be damned if it isn't a lot easier to do from any other role).  I feel I need to continue improving CS (especially outside of ADC), narrow down my champion pool and actually main something."

Can buy more vision wards as a support. They're super important for denying vision when contesting objectives and setting up ganks. Should also ward more when you stick with the yellow trinket. (IMO you should change to scrying orb as ADC once laning phase is over) CS on your ADC can be better Aegis is a strong item for team fights, either you or your jungler should consider picking it up."

I can't seem to stick with something for longer than a couple of weeks, although I'd really like to main 1 champ...   This seems to be your problem here. You don't need to learn all lanes and roles. You need to find a role or lane that you can stick with and master three champs. Riven is a good champion to start with. She has high snowball and can turn the tides of a game around, but you really need to train and watch videos about her animation cancel. Her damage output increases significantly and will allow you to deal tons of damage. Riven is a carry toplane like Wukong. Ever thought about picking up Irelia?"

I've read quite some guides and watched videos on Riven, so I should be OK there, just have to practice her some more, same goes for Wukong.  Why do you suggest Irelia? I've played some games with her in normals, but not enough to really decide if I like her or not."
summonerschool,3e2byk,Clever_Online_Name,7,Tue Jul 21 12:28:39 2015 UTC,"You obviously got a good understanding of both Top lane and Support, but keep in mind these numbers does not necessarily mean you are a weak jungler or ADC.   If you truely believe you have found the role you want to play as a jungler, you should do whatever you can to improve at the role and figure out what you are doing wrong in order to achieve a win rate lower than for example your top lane win rate.  I recommend getting a mentor to look through some replays and give you a few tips, or asking questions in the weekly Q&A thread."

Make sure you can do the bola jump which is the mid air E to snare them. Bot should be free kills once you hit 6, or mid if they're an immobile mage. You should never really be counter ganked when ulting a lane since you get the predator vision. Also don't build phage before lw, hydra,  gb"

But I'd advise you to try and find out why your winrate is so high with specific champions - nasus, trynd, shyvanna, fiora, udyr.   I'm kinda certain those champions fit your playstyle very well and that you try to change it up too much for the new junglers you wanna play.   Or identify what makes you so successful with those champions that you don't do with others"

Now I am going to swap some more runes (when I find time to grind for IP), but for now I also run flat armor yellows and flat mr blues.    Now NB3 says don't upgrade you jungle item as it is a waste of time and gold, but in our silver elo, it is very efficient.  I like clearing the whole starting side (eg. krug, buff, skuttle, raptors) then going back for upgraded jungle item.  Rush to other buff, other skuttle (if there), then clear out your jungle.    Keep an eye out for gank opportunities, especially immobile mid laners.  If they do not walk near the bushes, don't be afraid to walk behind the lane and toss out the bolas.     You really want that CDR to get rolling quickly (lucidity, brut, and your masteries should get you to 30% and blue will cap you.)

summonerschool,3e2byk,Flaming0Joe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"Its good to have two roles you're very comfortable on for ranked so I would probably stick to jungle as well as top.  Ultimately skills can be improved but enjoying the role is something that's harder to teach and very important when you're going to be playing it a lot.  For improving your jungling I first of all think you look alright, in your top champs your Junglers are all even or positive winrates and you don't even have that many games on them yet.  When jungling the most key skills are keeping track of the opposing jungler and making good map movements to maximize your time.  I found Crumbzz series of youtube videos to be quite helpful with this for me and it improved my jungling a lot to have his perspective on routes, which camps to clear, which to smite, when to gank, when to farm, when to counterjungle, ect."

The only real problem though is I don't know enough about the game to understand everything you're talking about (I'm almost level 15 on my first account).  The concept of counter-item building makes sense, but it doesn't help if I don't know what the enemy champ can do and what their items do.  :x"
summonerschool,3e22xz,Tsukasasoul,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:51 2015 UTC,"Comes with experience. Don't beat yourself up about it. First you should get a general grasp of the game and champions, then you can start thinking about tactic, itemization etc. otherwise the game gets really overwhelming.  Things like last hitting and standard item builds, picking against enemies etc. come with experience and after a while you won't have to think about these things actively anymore, then you should start to think about new things.  My best tip to learn items is:  Play a certain champ, find guides for the champ and follow them. After a while you""ll know the build and the items and can start thinking which items might also work on said champ in special situations. After a ton of games you'll know all items, what they do, who they counter, who they synergize with etc."
summonerschool,3e22xz,Willwas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"I've been getting better with last hitting, and I know a few champs pretty well (Annie, Pantheon, Mundo).  But since there are a lot of champs I don't know I go into say, playing Ashe and I don't know any items that would be good for that type of champ.  Since there are over 100 champs, trying to find builds for each one seems more overwhelming than learning a base for items and tailoring them to different champs as I learn what they do.  Maybe I'm wrong with that mindset, but that's kind of how it feels with the item system in this game.  It would be easier to see 1-2 items on an enemy champ and have a basic idea of what they are scaling/powering up so I can fight against it rather than know all the champs."
summonerschool,3e22xz,Tsukasasoul,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:58 2015 UTC,"You'll have to learn all the champs over time anyways, but there's no need to be intimidated by the high number of champs.  All ADCs build pretty much exactly the same (with some exceptions, but the basic build is pretty much the same)  APCs build pretty much the same (some minor variations, but Zhonyas, Rabadon, Voidstaff, Sorcerer boots works on 95% of the Midlaners)  Bruisers build similiar, same goes for Tanks and Supports.  As you see you'll just have to know 5 classes of champs, rather than >100 champs. If you understand the basic builds and learn more about the game you'll also play more champs and play against more different champs and get to know everything, no need to rush yourself.  A nice tip is to play every champ in the free champ rotation for ~3 games. That way you'll get to know >50% of champs in 3 Months, without buying any."

summonerschool,3e22xz,PM_ME_YOUR_STERNUM,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"Don't stop building items with actives. Treat them as additional spells you unlock with gold. I learned to use actives by keeping them in same item slots game after game, depending on their function (offensive/aggressive on 1, ""oh shit"" item on 2, ally target/buff/utility on 3) and just mashing those keys whenever required. Most items have short cooldown - even shorter with support masteries - and misuse probably won't cost you a game; spam actives whenever it makes slight sense. When you get used to actives at all, start working on their usage timing."

Even when in lane, trying to farm in human form, if you need to cs a creep but the enemy laner is too close for comfort, you can auto -->  switch to cougar --> pounce, and have the R+pounce combo go off before the auto hits a creep. Pounce will be on cooldown, but the auto that kills the minion you attacked resets pounce, giving you another pounce.

summonerschool,3e0ikn,Mofl,4,Tue Jul 21 00:55:23 2015 UTC,"Zyra is great in any elo I think, maybe especially in low elo. Most people underestimate her damage and if you can hit your skillshots, you can carry really well from the support role."

summonerschool,3e0ikn,mightBhigh,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:36 2015 UTC,She takes a high amount of time to learn. You have to be able to place your plants whereever you want while still hitting all your skillshots at the same time.   Not the easiest support to learn.  If you try to really learn her you should spend atleast 30-50 games straight playing her.   Her playstyle is close to Azir and Janna in my opinion.
summonerschool,3e0ikn,Harvery,3,Tue Jul 21 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"Really does take a long time to learn. I have about 1k games on her, let me tell you..it takes a long time to land E very consistently. If you can, you pretty much 1v2 bot lane"

summonerschool,3e0ikn,DJ_Keesee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"I like picking Zyra support when our team consists of almost only AD damage. At the end of the game she often has the most damage of the team (her full burst in team fights is insane).  Being squishy and immobile is a huge problem though. I tried to even it out with defensive runes, but it did not change much. Lyandri's is pretty much core (and Rylai's was a nice to have too), so I think I'll try her again with the newly buffed items. I'll try your offensive runes then. She seems like a high risk high reward support. If she doesn't fall behind she can outperform some mid laners. Offensive runes might give me the boost to get there.  Have you tried the new Rylai's on her? Since the slow from the E plants is only 30 % it's probably better to use Q plants for the slows (40 % > 30 %). I haven't tried it yet."

summonerschool,3e0ikn,Radinax,2,Tue Jul 21 10:37:40 2015 UTC,"Farm lanes are the worst. The best thing to do in this situation is to communicate with your AD in chat. Ask them to play up. If they say explicitly that they don't want to do that, don't argue, just try to harass (don't all in 1v2!) and be safe. It will drive you crazy, but you will live.

summonerschool,3e0ikn,DrMildChili,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:28 2015 UTC,Hi! I'm a Zyra player also (mid and support).   Normally I start E first in both lanes over Q. Is there anything wrong about this and is Q significantly better to start over the E?
summonerschool,3e0ikn,Dr_Irrelephant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:17 2015 UTC,You can start E as a support if you want. The reason why I take Q first is that at lvl 2 I get ranged plants rather than melee range plants and I find landing Qs are a lot easier than do more damage. Though I guess against melee supports E works just as well though your poke pressure is lower but the root is a definite plus.
summonerschool,3e0ikn,Knocko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:37 2015 UTC,"i posted this elsewhere but here's my thoughts on which spell to start:  Q: Don't take Q until you get to lane and see that your opponent is there pushing normally. Use your first Q to try and hit creeps without killing them to push for lvl 2. If you can, hit both creeps and the enemy ADC.  E: If you are invading or the enemy is invading you, you want to take E. CC is the most important thing in lvl 1 fights. This is why you don't take your Q on the platform, you want to be able to skill your E if you get invaded.   W: I don't usually do this, but you can start W and use seeds as mini-wards at lvl 1. This isn't optimal now that you can use trinkets at 30s, but it was a nice alternate strategy when they were on CD until 1:30. You can still do this if you really want the vision but you're giving up your lvl 2 push.  Basically, in normal situations I think Q is the best first spell because it does more damage and is easier to harass with, and the plant has a longer range."

summonerschool,3e3igf,SadlLife,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"Most tanks have pretty mediocre waveclear, so you should be able to shove the lane in quickly with tiamat and roam mid with ult or pressure the enemy topside jungle."
summonerschool,3e3igf,Pieson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"This is good advice for anyone against a champ with bad waveclear. Buy a couple of wards and ward your river/tri. Spend 3 minutes pushing waves into the tower so that malphite or shen have to use abilities to try and clear the waves under tower or risk losing CS.   Malphite will use all of his mana clearing, shen won't be able to use his vorpal blade to harass you.   Even if you're 0/0/0 by 20 minutes, you'll be up 50cs and have the gold advantage, although you should be roaming with your ult to try and pick up leads elsewhere."

summonerschool,3e1mkn,WiCKEDZ0MBiE,6,Tue Jul 21 06:58:14 2015 UTC,"This video does quite a good job of explaining it.   Quick and dirty method : if enemy wave is much bigger than yours, wait until all your minions are dead, leave at least three enemy ranged minions alive. From now on, only last hit and repeat each wave."
summonerschool,3e1mkn,reizuki,3,Tue Jul 21 07:07:25 2015 UTC,In this video Sickmotion teaches you how to freeze toplane from level1.  Be careful though because your lane opponent will hit level two before you. You will however hit level 3 first if you maintain the freeze.
summonerschool,3e1mkn,LeGreatToucan,2,Tue Jul 21 07:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give an explanation:   If a minion wave is pushing towards your tower you can try to freeze the wave in front of your tower to expose the enemy to ganks. To do so you clear all but the magic number of 3 caster minions at full HP and hold them just outside tower range. Once left behind these extra minions actually hold your wave long enough for the two waves to meet in this nice position in front of your tower. To keep the wave here, you need to control the wave by either pushing if the enemy pushes (which they probably will to get the minions under tower to reset back to middle) or just last hitting if that's what the enemy is doing. Point is you want to just hold it right in front and control the wave to keep that magic number of three minions in tact so you can open up the enemys to ganks.   In high elo this strategy is godly because junglers are actually really good and will support their laner's freeze. This means they will gank the moment the laner tries to break the freeze. Really scary. The only way to amend the situation is if they call for a jungler to help them break or to just roam."
summonerschool,3e1mkn,Strider08000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:48 2015 UTC,"However you must know that if the minions are damaged, or there are less than three, it start to push heavily away from you, if your wave kills the remaining minions before the next wave comes in. This is because your minions will group up and kill the damaged minions, then as they are grouped together, they will focus on the one melee minion coming in, and it will be 6v5. This will build up over time, and it is how to set up a slow push, which is also an essential technique in how to pressure mid-late game with just a minion wave."
summonerschool,3e1mkn,PM_ME_UR_RABBITS,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"by making sure the enemy wave is always larger than yours by a small margin usually by 3 ranged creeps, you do thi s by ONLY lasthitting at the last possible second when the wave is pushing towards you unitl you only have 3 ranged creeps left and you wave got wiped out, after that you tanks the enemy wave until your reinforcements meet up(enemy wave arrives atthesame time) . Now the enemy minios are slighty stronger making up for your last hitting and keeping the wave in place, as long as you always keep the same diffierence the wave will sit there(rinse and repeat as needed)  the way to counter a freeze is either shvoe the wave all the way to tower(this is counteracted by pushing by the same amount the enemy does)  so it resets or all inning the enemy laner when they are trying ot tank the wave."
summonerschool,3e1mkn,A_Garbage_Truck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:57:47 2015 UTC,"It's very easy really, all you need to do is make sure your minions take more damage than theirs so the lane pushes back to you. You can do this when the lane is reset (no minions in lane) by walking up to the enemy turret, tanking the creeps for a while and then running into a bush. This means that:   the enemy minions will be bunched up so deal damage faster and (mostly) all focus your first melee which is perfect since it'll die very fast the next wave of enemy minions will hit sooner than your minions since it's closer towards their turret, making them deal more damage.   This is commonly known as a soft freeze. At this point, all you want to do is last hit at the last possible second and NEVER DRAW AGGRO. If you draw minion aggro, the freeze is broken. After the second wave it gets significantly easier."
summonerschool,3e1mkn,rmonik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:35 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember about freezing a lane is you need to stick to mostly just auto attacking for last hits. If your champ uses mana, this will help you save it for trading in lane rather than getting creeps with it. Besides leaving a few extra cater minions on the enemy's side, try to keep the types of minions roughly the same like if the enemy casters gain one or two beyond what you want them to have you can try to kill them before they start doing too much damage and either start chunking you or push to tower and reset entirely. If your lane is the one pushing and they try to freeze, you need to break it asap by using whatever wave clear your kit includes and get their tower to reset the lane. Do that and let them harass you maybe once afterwards so your minions are attacking them and not the other minions, and you now have the beginnings of another lane freeze."

Once you master your W and E the rest of the game runs smoothly and can go from bursting down whole enemy team, to counter an initiation, to stoping an assassin from killing you, to even initiate a teamfight. Viktor is excellent at killing your enemies while running away from them. The potential you have to burst an enemy down or damaging them heavily while escaping is inmense and encourages the auto attack playstyle that most of us players should learn, except you alternate your abilities between movements.   If you lost lane or fell behind for some reason, remember that the utility you have at your disposal should not be understimated. A slow/stun that repositions your enemies in a vulnerable state and susceptible to your entire AoE and follow up from your teammates is nothing to laugh at. Viktor stays relevant throught the game because of the tools he possesses and how it can help you feel for the ADC that is doing the job you can't currently perform due to you falling behind.   The build: The reason why people differ from my opinion on Viktor's gameplay. You see, most players rush the first upgrade of the Hex Core for the waveclear, then they either go for Morellonomicon to evade mana problems or Luden's Echo to maximize wave clear, poke and AoE damage. I, however, rush The Perfect Hexcore all the time except for the ocassional Zhonya's Hourglass rush apgainst AD assassins or heavy dive comps. I prefer this build path because it gives you access to all the utility of your abilities early on and it also solves any mana problems you may encounter. I used to build Morellonomicon, but since I learned to manage my mana I slowly stopped building it. Additionally, I used to think CDR was a the most valuable stat for Viktor, but after trying different builds I realized it is better to hit harder in a single combo than hitting your combo more often. This is just my humble opinion and I encourage you to play more of Viktor.  Keep having fun!"
summonerschool,3e403v,Irving00d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"Luden's is not a great late-game item, and doesn't help Viktor enough to justify rushing, so you should probably replace it with a more synergistic item. Zhonya's is probably your best bet, especially in a game like that one where your enemy only has one real AP damage threat and his AoE is shit so unless you mis-position you will never take magic damage. Against dual AP threat comps Abyssal works, and against heavy surefire nukers (Diana, LB) who can probably 1-shot you all game, GA can work wonders.  For damage, Viktor needs 3 items: Hex3, Deathcap, Void Staff. Then you get Sorcs and 2 luxury items. One should have CDR on it (Morellonomicon/Athene's) and the other one is your flex item. Zhonya's is never a bad choice, Abyssal is functional and sometimes your best bet, Lich Bane is strong against some teams and AWFUL against others, GA is the ""I am the ONLY carry my team has and I cannot die"" item, BV is better against Vi and Hecarim and JAYCE/VARUS/EZREAL."

summonerschool,3e3ys1,Grappler82511,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"It's a little harder to help when your playing vs bots as they lack the natural responses of actual players(looking at your match history).  Here are some things I've discovered as a platinum ranked adc, however small, it shouldhelp you win laning:   You have more minions than the enemy, don't be afraid to trade, at early levels, minions do a surprising amount of damage which will help you win trades.   make sure your support doesn't take damage for free, if they engage on your support, take advantage although stay safe and trade as much as you can back. try to back around 50+ cs, generally you will have enough for a bf sword. If you can widdle your opponent down before hand, make them back for a vamp scepter or dorans and you can get bf, you will win your lane 99% of the time.(Lane bulls are notorious for this). last but certainly not least, build accordingly. Do they have tanks? Build a blade of the ruined king. When I was in silver, I was told not to aim the tanks, however if given the chance, you should be taking care of their damage, tanks are often in your face. You need to be able to get passed the first. Not only relatively close situations such as skirmish in the jg or picking someone out. This also includes building last whisper to get pass the annoying armor.     Fights often are dictated buy who can kill the front line first this is why winning landing phase is important. No front line, no back line right?  Edit1: sourcing myself Edit2: some grammar spelling"
summonerschool,3e3ys1,Aystogon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:51 2015 UTC,"In general, getting better comes with just playing the game more.  Firstly understand which ADC's you're good with and why. Technically all ADC's are similar enough mechanically but I'd suggest choosing 2 that have different strengths such as a Utility based ADC and a hypercarry ADC.  For CS practice, open up a custom game on Murder Bridge with no enemies, don't buy any items (Runes and masteries are ok but some people suggest not using them) and practice CSing for 10 mins. Practice using your main ADCs. With no enemies you should eventually be able to get to 80+ cs in 10 mins minutes eventually. Now add a bot enemy and try to do the same thing. Now add 2 bot enemies. Now add 3 bot enemies. By the time you add 3 bot enemies you're starting to work on something new, positioning. The bots are programmed to harass you when they outnumber you. They will make csing difficult but that's the point. Do this as needed but don't expect to get perfect CS with 3 bots. It's more like trying to improve your high score each time you attempt it.  As for trading, play normal games and just try to be super aggressive to the enemy adc. Like stupidly aggressive. This will help you learn what your limits are. If you die while being stupidly aggressive, try to recognize when you should've restrained yourself. Aggression is useless if you don't know how/when to pull back at the right time and you'll start to recognize your ADC's strengths/weaknesses when aggressive.  Look up info on powerspikes specific to your main ADCs. This will also help you trade and all-in. Powerspikes come in the form of maxing certain abilities, having access to your ultimate, getting a good item, etc. When you have a powerspike is ideally when you want to be pushing your aggression (assuming the enemy doesn't have a powerspike that's stronger than yours or happened before you.)  Lastly, main another role. You should be good enough to play all roles and do okay but excel at 2 roles. This helps so much if someone picks your first role. I practice support because it helps me learn bot lane matchups even more.  Despite everything I said, all of this can be learned by simply playing the game more and just actively focusing on the one area you want to improve. For one game, just focus on getting perfect CS. For another game, just focus on being aggressive and trading. For a different game, focus on getting 0 deaths and minimizing getting caught. By focusing on one area of improvement it helps that skill stick and you'll also be able to see where you're doing poorly in other areas. If you focus on getting 0 deaths but you have to give-up a lot of CS to do so, then next time you're probably gonna want to focus on getting more CS while still not trying to die."
summonerschool,3e3vr2,AManWithNoHart,3,Tue Jul 21 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"Ward anywhere you need vision of.   Once you get a sightstone you should try to get a ward in tribrush, river, and one of the side brushes (depending on where the lane is favoring. Their side if you are pushing them, and your side if they are pushing you)  If they are constantly pushing the wave, don't worry about the river ward, but instead ward tribrush and your closest side brush.   After laning phase, use wards as needed. Try to get wards in their side of the jungle so you can see them rotating, or use your wards to protect dragon/baron."

I only saw one game with 30 wards with you usually placing in the 20-25 range for a good game and a measly ~10 for a bad game.  I know it cat feel like that is enough, but it isn't.   A good target number is ~1 per minute but I find that a bit idealized.  Realistically in a 40 minute game I always hit 30 and usually hit 35 and once in a great while, nearly 50 wards.    So start with just WARDING MORE.  Worry about locations after you get into the habit of warding lots, because anywhere is better the nowhere.

I've been getting it as a 3rd or 4th item recently and it kinda helps with kiting around gap closing bruisers and it makes you a bit more tanky.

summonerschool,3e3rfj,DrixGod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:53 2015 UTC,"Focus on farming instead of trying to get kills can help with consistency. Basically, if you can help it, be more passive."
summonerschool,3e3rfj,tbnboy815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"Might need you to give some more info here but here are my thoughts:  If you play the lane enough and have one or two adcs that you play in +80% of your matches you are naturally going to increase consistency. Consistency comes from knowing your champion and lane matchups. If you know the lane well you will never get stomped in lane (except the occasion where you get 4 manned all lane phase, in which case pray your team is doing something elswhere). Not to say you won't lose lane, but a lost lane will be a cs deficit rather than an 0/3/x start. I tend to play hypercarries (e.g. jinx, vayne) so I know I'm going to give up cs early, I know I have to choose trades carefully. Granted I still make plenty of mistakes, but simple lane knowledge helps me minimize deficits.  Stopping the bleeding is huge as well. If you come out of lane with a CS deficit and down a kill or a few you are going to want to farm as much as possible. That being said, you can't safely do so if the enemy has MIAs and the lane is pushed up. A lot of games in lower elos spin out of control mid game simply because one team does a much better job of catching the other out. As an ADC, you are the number one priority for them so be very cautious about the waves you farm and what bushes you face check in the jungle.  TL;DR choose a couple of champs and learn the lane and its matchups well and you will minimize deficits in lost lanes."
summonerschool,3e3rfj,IFingered,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:38 2015 UTC,Maybe focusing on champions with less kill potential in lane like Kogmaw would help?
summonerschool,3e3rfj,IFingered,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:36 2015 UTC,"what do you mean by kill potential? As in kog has less kill potential against the lane opponent? Or kog has less potential to be killed in lane?  In general, kog is one of the least safe adcs in lane. I'd say kog actually has the worst mobility of anyone in the role--Jinx has hard cc with chompers, varus with ult, MF passive move speed, twitch with stealth, etc. Sure he can farm safely with w up, but a jungler or support with hard cc can VERY easily lock him down with flash+engage. Not sure if that's what you meant, so please clarify and I'd be happy to give a more accurate response."

summonerschool,3e2sn1,Karmoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"As long as you are CSing well and not dying, you will climb, however thats what you should do at mid/high/highhigh elo. In low elo (gold and lower) you need to carry games, and while CSing perfectly will put you 5 kills worth of gold ahead of your lane opponent/s, it doesn't help your team who will be inevitably suffering from the same lack of CS, and even be feeding.   To remedy this, you have to pressure everything you can, crush your enemy laner, get global gold for your team, teleport or roam to other lanes to get them ahead. When playing the game at low (or most) elos, you have to be that guy who hard carries his team."

Carrying isn't just about getting kills, as you know, and even getting kills requires good vision and experience of champion matchups/power spikes.  I dragged myself out of bronze purely by CSing well and not dying. With the superior levels and gold, the kills seem to come naturally (for an ADC at least).  The whole 'you have to carry your team' is a big misnomer in my opinion, and the obsession with it leads to yolo chases through unwarded enemy jungles and people frustrated because they believe they carried (they have 20 kills!), but actually they fed (they have 15 deaths).

Sure, KDAs improve a tiny bit for each rank (that's why they are different ranks), and ward purchases rise pretty dramatically per rank.  On the other hand, take a look at CS.  I think that is a pretty solid indicator of pure mechanical expertise that isn't really affected by particular matchups or teammates.  It plateaus around Gold rank.  In terms of actual gold/game, it starts to go down after gold - indicating that people are just getting better at avoiding deaths and closing out games sooner, rather than making the kinds of core mechanical adjustments that silver/bronze players tend to need. (yes, it does not include average game length, which might mean my interpretation is flat out wrong, I admit).  However, my point is that it seems like you're implying ""low elo"" players lack the mechanical skills, but based on the actual data, I'm not convinced that is true - especially since your advice is very specifically related to CS, which doesn't change much after gold."

Unless you are sitting on 3000g you should probably be rotating to another objective to put pressure and/or siege. I watch sooo many of my replays where the enemy that is ahead wins lane loses game because they do nothing with their advantage constantly backing to get stronger but watching their team die in a skirmish while he's walking back. Congrats no matter how fed you are you can't 1v4.

summonerschool,3e2sn1,Strider08000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"If you are in S4:  Farm through the late game. Aim to get 70cs/10min, all game long. That basically means that you farm a camp while rotating (if you aren't running to a teamfight or to contest something) and you catch waves when they start to pass your dead outer turrets. Push them up to the river, make sure they continue pushing (read these two things to learn how to tell when it will).   The fact that you started a push gives you map pressure, possibly denies cs, and probably takes a turret. Think of all the times that turrets die to minions in your games, and then imagine that only enemy turrets die that way."

summonerschool,3e0mya,KeonkwaiJinkwai,2,Tue Jul 21 08:55:17 2015 UTC,"If you were to group junglers (champions) into different categories, which categories would you use and what traits (strengths, weaknesses, priorities) would those categories hold?"
summonerschool,3e0mya,lemon07r,2,Tue Jul 21 07:53:08 2015 UTC,"So, there are obviously some champions that overlap between categories, but loosely I think we have 3 main types of champions in the jungle.   Those are pure tank, fighter/bruiser, and assassin, all of which could be either ap or ad.   Then I think you have a few picks that are either exceptions or off-meta like fiddle, kayle, karthus, or twitch.  Of the 3 main categories, tanks typically have large amounts of sustain, damage reduction, or cc in their kits and look to impact the game by farming the gold to build tanky items asap and ganking with their cc heavy kits (usually after 6 when they get their ults).    They are often weaker pre-6 before they have levels or items and do poorly when they cannot get these because either their team/themselves have fallen too far behind.  Fighters tend to have a faster clear and mobility which they use to apply earlier pressure to both the lanes and the opposing jungler.   They typically build one or two damage items before building tankier stuff depending on how well they are doing.   Their weakness lies in the fact that eventually they lack the tankiness to survive long in teamfight while also lacking the damage to do much unless they are directly on top of a squishy, so they often look to impact the early and mid game before they fall off.  The third category, assassins, typically have large amounts of damage and mobility in exchange for being relatively squishy and having minimal cc.   The interesting thing about this group is that there are both early game assassins like shaco and mid/late game assassins like kha/rengo.  However, the goal for each of these subsegments is to have enough of a damage threat to kill an out of position squishy.   Assassins have the ability to snowball a game out of control, but can also become a liability to their team if they fall too far behind and don't have enough damage to perform their job."
summonerschool,3e0mya,Irrational_San,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:13 2015 UTC,"In terms of personal objectives/goals I think junglers can be divided into 3 main types.    Farming junglers- those that scale well with gold and levels and whose main objective is to soak up farm and exp (master yi,karthus, etc).     Ganking/skirmishing jungler- junglers that have high early game damage and whose main objectives are to snowball lanes/ shut down enemy jungler (lee sin, nidalee, etc).    Utility/tank junglers- juglers that bring cc/utility/tankiness to team comps (sejuani,gragas,etc)"
summonerschool,3e0mya,1everdude,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic post. There are tons of posts about when to gank vs farm, counter jungling, and all the other details in jungling, but very few about the mindset you should have while jungling. While it doesn't give a lot of specific how to's, it gives the proper mindset to make the right decisions in each situation, which is (in my opinion) even more important than mechanics."
summonerschool,3e0mya,Thonked,2,Tue Jul 21 09:43:56 2015 UTC,"Excellent writeup! Congrats on Gold, I just reached it myself as a jungle main. http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Thonked I'd have to agree that, while I don't have the best mechanics I have succeeded through an understanding of the game and my role in it. Do you have any areas of focus to bring your game to the Plat level?"
summonerschool,3e0mya,Thonked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:02 2015 UTC,"One thing I want to do is just play more games.   I work and go to school, so I often only play 3 ranked games or so a week.   However, this coming semester my workload will be lighter and I'll hopefully be able to get a few more games in.    As for the actual games, I'll likely put a larger focus on gaining and especially denying vision.   People in bronze and silver simply don't know how to ward, so I could get away with just upgrading my warding trinket as a psuedo-sightstone.  Now, however, some people other than the support know how to place proper wards, so I'll likely transition to the sweeper and buy more sight wards.   In conjunction with that I want to start being more aware of the enemy jungler and spend more resources to harrass him or actively interfere with his ganks rather than just pinging his position or warning my lanes.  Lastly, I'd like to introduce some more damage oriented champs into my midlane.  I prefer jungle > mid > supp in that order and avoid adc and top if at all possible, but my midlane pool largely consists of utility champs with which I aid my team and basically transition into a second jungler (morgana, lulu, orianna).  So I'll probably be adding ahri and swain into my ranked pool for when I want put out more damage."
summonerschool,3e0mya,AJRollon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"I feel ya on more games. I work 9-5 and when I get home I don't have a ton of time to play.   When it comes to warding, I may just keep upgrading my yellow if I feel like my team is lacking in vision, not sure how well Gold handles the vision game."
