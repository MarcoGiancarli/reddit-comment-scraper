Seeing how much love we feel from Jesus is what should drive people to Him."
TrueChristian,3dzb20,redvette77,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:19 2015 UTC,"Well put. I don't want to undermine the tragedy of hell, but I wonder how a relationship can flourish when it starts under the pretense of, ""if I don't love you, I'll be damned, so I'm going to try really hard to love you because I'm scared of the consequences"". It sounds like be prodded to love something by a hot poker. Can real love start that way? It sounds like the start of a dysfunctional relationship."
TrueChristian,3dzb20,addtothebeauty,0,Tue Jul 21 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"Isn't that pretense exactly what the basis of christianity is? It's a free gift for you to accept, but if you don't accept it than you burn for eternity. It's compulsory love, which is no love at all."
TrueChristian,3dzb20,Fckbama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"I have often felt the same way myself.  That said, I've recently started questioning my base principles in believing this.  I was raised to believe that God's glory is his highest aim and thus our purpose - in salvation and otherwise - is to bring God glory above all else, and that this is best done through a relationship with him.  But the church didn't always hold to this.  The puritans, early catholicism, lutheran history, etc. all had different emphases on man's ultimate function and the purpose of salvation and how it works.  So, how do we know that we have it right now and this, ""Love Jesus, glorify God"" stuff isn't just a product of the fact that we now live in a culture that emphasizes relationships and love over obedience?"

Personally, I have seen a whole lot more people respond to the claims of Christ based on His love for them than some ""turn don't burn"" message.

But rather ""why do we do what we do?"".  Faith will lead to works naturally, which the half brother of Christ is clearly stating in his epistle.

It's a long passage, but the overall context is useful.  Here you go.  James 2:14-24   14 What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? 17 Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.  18 But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.” 19 You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. 20 But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 22 You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; 23 and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. 24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone."

TrueChristian,3dzb20,VanTil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:33 2015 UTC,"Is repentance a work?   It might be, but even if it is, it doesn't cause us to earn ourselves anything. However, there does seem to be a salvative aspect to some works (like baptism) done in accordance with faith and repentance. But since we're saved by grace, and we know that we don't earn anything through works, it would seem that God grants us grace through good works.   Does repentance precede or follow salvation?   Based on what was recorded in Scripture, it seems to precede salvation.  Here are all the references to repentance in the NT.

TrueChristian,3dzb20,wowsuchdrum,4,Mon Jul 20 22:20:19 2015 UTC,"Copied this from another place in this thread I posted:  Faith without works is dead, but works are a result of our faith.   There is nothing that I can do to earn my salvation, which is what I believe the author is saying.   Eph. 2:8-9 Rom. 10:9 Titus 3:5"
TrueChristian,3dzb20,VanTil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:36 2015 UTC,"And yet it was Abraham's faith that was accounted to him as righteousness, not his works, right (Rom 4:3,9)?  I believe that scrpiture is clear that in the order of salvation, true saving faith will produce works.  I mean heck, it's right there in the sermon on the mount.  Fig trees will not produce thistles nor will thistles produce figs.  You will know them by their fruit.  Yet not everyone who comes to Him calling ""Lord, Lord"" will be saved but only those who do the will of His father.  Indeed, many will come to Him on that day and claim righteousness on the basis of their works having cast out demons, prophesied and done many miracles in His name.  And Christ's response?  ""Depart from me, I never knew you, you workers of iniquity"".  Our works are not necessary for salvation, they are a natural outflowing of saving faith.  If we claim to have faith without works, then our faith is probably a false one.  Likewise if we have works without faith, those works are dead and are works of iniquity.  The Ordo Salutis is incredibly important."
TrueChristian,3e0lec,Quravin,7,Tue Jul 21 01:06:59 2015 UTC,"This is the danger that C. S. Lewis warns against in his preface to Mere Christianity - that by using the same word to mean different things people would ultimately get confused over doctrinal issues or what it means to be a Christian.  In this case, that word is ""believe.""  Saying you ""believe"" in the modern understanding of the word doesn't do anything.  I believe that 4 x 2 = 12.  I believe that Obama is the current president of the USA.  My belief in these things doesn't mean anything to me at all until I start to do something differently because of my belief.  This is what it means to have faith.  I'll paste what I wrote to someone else who was struggling through a very similar issue.    Faith in the biblical sense requires two components: (1) a modern day belief - intellectual acknowledgment of the truth of a matter, and (2) an entrusting.  If we live our lives in a way that demonstrates a trust in a particular belief system, but don't intellectually acknowledge the truth behind it, we do not believe. Such people are self-deceived hypocrites, pursuing religious practices because they think it will save them, all the while denying the power and person behind those practices. Likewise, James 2 references those who have an intellectual acknowledgment of who Christ is and what he did, but refuse to entrust their lives to him. Such people are dead in in their ""faith"" because their faith is not complete.  That is not to say that works do any form of saving or are even a prerequisite to salvation. Rather, it is the entrusting part. Entrusting itself also has two components: (1) an ownership, and (2) a transfer of power or possession. In the context of salvation, all we have is our lives - and even these we received from God. But he saw it fit to give transfer power and possession of our lives to us (not ownership - they were never ours and never will be). In essence, God entrusted our lives to us. But let's be clear - that's not to say God had faith in humanity, for he has no intellectual acknowledgment that we will accomplish his purposes without him. Because of this, we cannot say God ""trusted"" us with our lives, rather he ""entrusted"" to us our lives.  What was the point of this entrusting? That we would glorify Him by reciprocating the gesture. We were created in His image to model His character and actions. God's character and action was to entrust us with our lives. Modeling Him would be to entrust our lives back to Him, just as He did. Since all we have is power and possession of our lives, and we are incapable of giving possession back, our best is to transfer power over our lives to God. This means that God gets to make the decisions over what we do and not us.  Note that this ""entrusting"" of power over our lives does not necessarily mean we have done anything. It is, rather, us saying that God will choose what we do and when we do it. Our imperfect ability to transfer power of our lives fully to God (resulting in the absence of ""works"") does not affect the willing desire in our hearts. Rather, it is our job to create that willingness and it is God's job to generate the actions/works. Even as a Christian, because I am in sinful flesh, I cannot do anything but sin apart from God's power enabling me to do otherwise. Accordingly, no man can take credit for his own works, and because of this, the only thing we are capable of doing for God is giving him the power to do good in and through us.  Good works are a necessary byproduct of faith. After all, if we give power over our lives to God, do you think he will decline to use it? Will he tell us, ""Sorry, I didn't actually have a plan for you - I didn't really set apart good works in advance for you""? No, he'll make use of the power that we give Him.  To clarify one point, I should probably be referencing ""God-pleasing works"" instead of ""good works."" The word ""good"" is too muddled with human understanding and culture. Anything that is not God-pleasing is sin. There are things that seem ""good"" to us, but which are not God pleasing (Proverbs 14:12). Verses like Isaiah 64:6 and Hebrews 11:6 clarify that ""God-pleasing"" works cannot occur without faith. This is how we know that faith and God-pleasing works are distinct and not one and the same. In light of all of this, God-pleasing works can't save us because they can't be performed until after we have already entrusted power over our lives to God.  Because I like illustrations (although this one may be a bit over-simplified): I can't draw a beautiful picture with my friend's pencil until he actually gives me the pencil. Despite my telling him what I want the picture to look like, my friend would be incapable of drawing the picture himself if the pencil were in his own hand. So, he cannot draw the picture that pleases me without first transferring power and possession over that thing which I must have in order to do it myself. At the same time, although I might be able to get another pencil and still draw the picture, it would not have been my friend's pencil that was part of my pleasure - if anything, I would be annoyed and displeased as his refusing me such a simple request: to use his pencil. [We may not view entrusting our lives to God as something so simple as giving a pencil, but to an infinite and all-powerful God who knows what he's going to do with our lives, he might think differently.] Alternatively, if the person holds out his hand with his pencil toward me, but communicates that he doesn't really want me to have it or to draw anything with it that pleases Him, and that he really likes his pencil and wants to keep it for himself, he's just doing it because he thinks that is his obligation, I'm probably going to say, ""Sorry to be a bother ... I'll just go get another pencil instead."""
TrueChristian,3e0lec,ruizbujc,4,Tue Jul 21 02:50:45 2015 UTC,"Faith isn't a acknowledgement of a historical event. Like what's been said, demons know Christ rose from the grave. Faith is what receives the forgiveness that Christ won for us on the cross. Faith is trusting in the hope of the resurrection. Faith is accepting the nourishment given to us poor, famished, miserable sinners.  A Christian will necessarily produce good fruit. Much like an apple tree produces apples or a sheep produces wool. Christians do good works because it flows from the change the Holy Spirit does within us. If an apple tree doesn't produce apples, it's chopped down and burned."

TrueChristian,3e0lec,wowsuchdrum,3,Tue Jul 21 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"This could be rather lengthy, but I'll do my very best to be very thorough.     The Short Versions:   What does it really mean to be saved?   To have your sins forgiven, be restored to a correct relationship with God - our creator - and be granted eternal life with God in Heaven. Being saved refers to both being saved ""from sin"" and ""from hell"". Hell is the punishment God prescribes for sinners that are not saved.    Does God need me to say the words   Yes, if you are able to, and even more so you should do it publicly. Obviously if you cannot speak (say you had your tongue cut out), that is not a barrier to salvation. But if you can say the words aloud, you should.    [Does God need me] to live the words meaning?    Yes (sort of). God needs you to try and live the words' meaning. It is understood that you will not be able to succeed totally in this life; but a sincere effort must be made at all times.    If I say I “believe in God” and think that gives salvation, does that mean the words themselves are important or the meaning of them?   Both. A public declaration of faith is one of the signs that you have that faith. The meaning of those words should reflect what you actually believe in your heart, otherwise you would be a liar. God hates liars.    What if I say I believe, but my lack of faith reveals that I don’t believe God is good/strong enough to save me?    Then you are likely lying to yourself. It is understood that God knows your true thoughts, your innermost secrets.   God knows whether you are just saying 'I believe in God' to ... fit in with friends/family, or whether you really believe in him.   If you truly don't believe, then you are not saved. If you truly do believe, but have some doubts, then you are truly saved.     Lengthy version.    What does it really mean to be saved?    Being saved means 4 things, from 2 important steps.    Step 1: Having Faith in Jesus Christ, his atoning death, and resurrection.    Having faith that Jesus Christ, who lived a perfect sinless life - that we could not - paid the penalty for our sins by his willing death on the cross. That he resurrected himself as a promise of every believers future resurrection and eternal life.   Faith = Trust; so having faith in Christ means having faith that A) He lived/died/and rose again exactly as the scriptures say he did & B) that his life/death/and resurrection was sufficient to pay the penalty for our sins in the eyes of God. Trusting that there is nothing else we need to do to be saved, other than trusting Christ.   *Step 2: Repentance   This means 'to turn from' something - in this case our past sinful lives. Understanding that we humans are sinful, and that because of our sins we needed to be saved from God's punishment; and understanding Step 1, we should no longer sin, be sinful, or do sinful things.   Repentance has two parts: A) acknowledging that we sin, and B) not sinning anymore. When you first come to faith in Christ, you should say something like ""I am a sinner, God, and I am sorry for all my sins. Please forgive me."" And then live the rest of your life without sinning.   Step 2.5: Constant Repentance   It is not possible in this life to fully stop sinning. Read Romans chapters 6, 7 & 8 for further details. When we do sin it should be a mistake, and we should immediately pray and apologize for sinning to God. This is called 'confession'. In 1st John, chapter 8, John tells us that God promises to continually forgive us when we sin, if we confess it.    Part 1: Justification   Being saved means being saved from the penalty of sin. The penalty of sin is death. The death of our soul & body. Our body dies and rots in the earth, while our soul 'lives on', but the death of a soul is separation from God. Separation from God (who is all that is good) is Hell - eternal suffering.   That is the penalty of our sin, and it is what we are saved from.    Part 2: Sanctification   This is being saved from the power of sin in our lives. Sin is seductive, and makes people want to do it. Sin constantly tempts us to do sinful things. Part of being saved is being saved from the power of sin to tempt us.   A truly saved person experiences a hatred of sinful things; a disgust at sinful things, and a longing to be without sin in their lives. For the saved person, sin no longer has power over them, and its seductive powers are eliminated.    Part 3: Glorification    This is being saved from the presence of sin. It is Christ's promise to resurrect each of us, where we will have new bodies that are without sin in them; in heaven where there is no sin at all. At that future time, there will be no sin in or around us, and so we will not be in sin's presence. Glorification is the promise of future sinlessness.    Does God need me to say the words, or live their meaning?   God does not 'need' you to do anything.   Faith & Repentance in Christ is set up as a doorway. You have to walk through that specific door to be saved.   The bible teaches that we cannot even see that door without God's direct intervention. So it is by no action or deed of your own that you come to have faith in Christ, or repent of your sins; but those things are a gift of God.   All you can do to 'get yourself saved' is pray to God that he will give you those things (Faith & repentance).   The words you say are not magic, and do not impress God or convince him to save you. That you truly believe these words: ""I am a sinner, deserving of death & hell. But God is good and just and faithful, who came to die instead of me as Jesus the Christ. Because of God's own death, I can be forgiven. Forgive me please, Jesus Christ, I am a sinner and need to be forgiven! I believe that you died for my sins, was buried for 3 days, and resurrected, as I will one day be resurrected.""   That you truly believe those words is more important that whether you 'say them'. Though as a sign that you believe them, you should say them aloud; and in public.    If I say I “believe in God” and think that gives salvation, does that mean the words themselves are important or the meaning of them?   Saying them is a sign that you believe them. Faith & Repentance in Christ's death on the Cross is what is important.    What if I say I believe, but my lack of faith reveals that I don’t believe God is good/strong enough to save me?    If you say you believe, but have no faith, then you are not saved; and are a liar.   If you say you believe, and have some faith and some doubts, then you are saved; and should pray to God for stronger faith.   If you say you believe, and have full faith, then you are saved and should pray to God to give you opportunities to share your faith with others.     TL;DR Being saved means believing that Jesus died for your sins, instead of you dying. Believing that is more important that saying that. Saying that is a sign you believe that."
TrueChristian,3e0lec,jmj1970,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that. I'm a lengthy kind of person, so I appreciated your detail.   I'm afraid that there's too much in my life to ever articulate in a Reddit comment, but I'm still lost.   As I said in another comment, what if it's not ""working""? I feel dead and dark and empty inside. If this is how other Christians feel all the time yet they still force themselves to do/say the right thing, then I'm truly at a loss.  I have spent the past two and a half years in the darkest, lowest place of my life. Through it all - no matter how much I plead (in word or in action), repent (in word or in action) - I have felt a distinct lack of Christ. People are quick to say that God is not an emotion, but come on, if that's the case then why do I feel so black?   I have stopped smoking (for brief times), attended Bible study, done two dosages each of three antidepressants, been on mission trips, gone to churches with foreign communities, seen and continue to see a Christian therapist, met with and continue to meet with nearly a dozen men and elders from my church, opened up to my parents, been to youth revival weekends, looked up Bible verses for dark struggles, left my Bible open on the table so I read it first thing in the morning, taped Bible verses to my wall, prayed and pleaded and begged with God, put time blockers on the computer, stopped putting my faith in my efforts and verbally/mentally trusted God instead...and still, all I feel is life in sin and death in Christ.   Sorry to unload all this on you, but I am done caring and really need answers wherever possible."
TrueChristian,3e0lec,JIVEprinting,2,Tue Jul 21 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, Bro&/orSis (gonna go with Bro), I get you completely.   I see several things at play in your heartfelt post. I'd like to talk about each of them briefly.    Thing-at-play #1: You are trying to hard.    I wish I had a good analogy for this, but basically you are worrying yourself into a position where God won't work in your life.   I've done this, I have friends that have done this / are doing this right now. You are too 'clenched' and too concerned with having control over your own life, sin, feelings; and because you are so clenched you are trying to do so many different things to try and make-things-right with God. I'm going to repost your list for you.    I have stopped smoking (for brief times), [I] attended Bible study, [I have] done two dosages each of three antidepressants, [I have] been on mission trips, [I have] gone to churches with foreign communities, [I've] seen and continue to see a Christian therapist, [I've] met with and continue to meet with nearly a dozen men and elders from my church, [I've] opened up to my parents, [I've] been to youth revival weekends, [I've] looked up Bible verses for dark struggles, [I've] left my Bible open on the table so I read it first thing in the morning, [I've] taped Bible verses to my wall, [I've] prayed and pleaded and begged with God, [I've] put time blockers on the computer, [I've] stopped putting my faith in my efforts and verbally/mentally trusted God instead...and still, all I feel is life in sin and death in Christ.    Look at all the work you are doing to try and cover up your sins. Are you sure you are at rest in God's saving-grace?   You should watch this video Bro, it's only like 10 minutes long but it is a really good explanation of the christian struggle. Also, these videos are each like 1 min long; but they are also good. Vid 1 Vid 2  My advice to you brother is 'let go' of trying to save yourself, and trust that God has saved you. Ever done a 'trust fall' exercise? Like that, but with God instead of some kid @ summer camp.    Thing-at-play #2: Sinful life style   You said if one of your other comments in this thread that you've been into some pretty sinful stuff the past few years. Nothing is going to cause more stress & anxiety than a lifestyle of constant sinning. It's not wondering you are working so hard (see point #1) if your life has recently been extra-sinful.   Best advice would be to make some hard-life choices and cut out the sinful people/places/things that are leading you astray. It might be really hard, it might be really not-so-fun, but long term anxiety/depression relief will be had!   I used to be into sex/drinking, occasional drug use and lived a life pretty nasty. (Not like... super nasty, but nasty enough) I'm so much happier, and I feel was less guilty now that I've cut that crap out.   The hard part, at the time, was that I didn't want to stop all that stuff. I liked those things, and more relevantly, I liked the people I was doing them with. They were my friends, and I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. So ditching a whole social circle was really hard for me.   But man was it worth it. I don't know what kind of stuff you are / were into, but if you are/were a smoker I can make a few guesses.    Thing-at-play #3: Your expectations   You said:   what if it's not ""working""?   Check your expectations, brother in christ. Are you expecting what the bible tells you to expect? Or are you expecting something different?   The bible tells us, in several places (Romans 7 is just one example), that a christian life is a life of spiritual conflict. War with the flesh, powers and principalities of this world. War.   Not 'happy-rainbow-unicorn-friendliness: the experience'. John 16:33 ""33 I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”   The most sure fire way to make yourself crazy anxious and depressed is to be expecting an instantaneous transformation from sinner-to-saint the second you pray a salvation prayer.   The bible teaches us that sin comes from 3 sources, The World / The Flesh & the Devil.   Salvation has 3 parts: Sanctification/ Glorification / Justification (not in that order).   Sanctification cleans ""the world"" off of us. That takes time. Justification saves us from the Devil. Glorification saves us from the Flesh - in the future. We still have to deal with our own fleshiness from now until the afterlife / 2nd coming.   That battle between our spirit & flesh is a war. War is not fun or pretty.   Expecting to be instantly triumphant and immediately saintly is going to cause you to feel exactly the way you are describing yourself. Anxious and depressed and feeling abandoned by God.   Take several deep breaths, do a mental ""trust fall with God"", and realize that God saved you before you were even born; before you ever took your first breath or sinned your first sin. God saved you.   You cannot out-sin his forgiveness. You cannot out-sin your salvation. Stop focusing so much on your own sinfulness, and instead appreciate Christ for who he is, what he did, and what he is like.   Realize that you are secure in your salvation; and take a rest from your own works. End any / as much sinfulness in your lifestyle as possible; and pray that the rest be taken care of by God.   Stop getting drunk, smoking, drugs, sex-out-of-marriage, lying, porn, and anything else that Jesus-would-not-do.   Consult your 'christian-therapist' and ask him/her whether he/she can counsel you on learning to trust God, rather than trying to impress him / make him fit your expectations.   Learn to adjust your expectations to what the bible tells you to expect. Don't be upset that what you imagined isn't actually the case.   And above all pray - not for anything - but just to talk to God.   Do you know how to talk to a girlfriend (or boyfriend if you are a girl)? Do you know how to talk to a loved one? Pray to God as a loved one; tell him your secrets, your worries, your fears. Don't put expectations on God to fix them - he's not your janitor - but talk to him as a loved one.   Learn the fruits of the spirit Galatians 5:22-23. Seek God 1st; everything else second. Remember this isn't about you, it's about him. Rejoice in suffering  Someday you might be called to share your eventual triumph over this stuff with someone else in need.     Does any of that make sense? Have you heard all of that stuff before?   The secret to getting out of the dark-place you are in, is to realize that you aren't in a dark place; at all - but that you have your eyes closed and God is telling you to open them."

So many things of the same things have been said to me by trusted friends, so that makes it a bit more meaningful to me.   The issue with the use of I've is that, yes, it shows how much ""effort"" I try to make instead of trusting Christ...but in that list I described how much of my effort also was put into seeking out redemption in Christ. I even stopped ""trying"" at certain points, and still remained the same. That is the only real roadblock I face.   I do not know where God's plan for my life ends and my sin keeping me away from His light begins. I basically treated every attempt to break free as my last, putting all of my energy into that one effort. This is why I am so weak to resisting sin, I just simply cannot exert myself to that level anymore."

I believe that we as Christians are free to attend the services of other religious groups, but Jewish services can be especially enriching since our faiths are rooted in the same tradition.    However, 'involved in Jewish activities"" is something you'd have to analyze on a case-by-case basis.  Like, it's all fine and good to go to synagouge, but some prayers and rituals will involve explicitly or implicitly rejecting important Christian doctrine.    For example, I know some Jewish prayers ask God to send the Messiah.  This is a problem for Christians, who believe that God has already come to us as the Messiah.  Sure, you can mentally append a little note to it that you're talking about the Second Coming of the Lord, but that's not really an honest way to pray the prayer.    Additionally, I would try to do research on who is allowed to participate in what in Jewish law.

TrueChristian,3dwhz6,wowsuchdrum,7,Mon Jul 20 03:26:42 2015 UTC,"I think ""backsliders"" are those who never had a true conversion.   A believer always falls into sin, it is never planned, and they always bounce back. If a ""christian"" is experiencing long periods of sin, it is cause for concern imo. They should work out their salvation with ""fear and trembling.""  It is important to keep in mind that faith without works is dead, and God gives every true believer a new heart with new desires, and their actions should follow as such. So I think anyone who says they came to God as a child, fell away, and then came back, probably wasnt saved in the first place.   I say probably because I can't be certain, as I'm sure there are cases where it is true. But God is looking for ""a few good men"" If you will, and, frankly, isn't interested in people who are in and out and in at their own leisure.

Once you are born again, of the spirit you have that security.  I honestly feel that the tale of the lamp stands is one of the Wheat and the Chaff, half the church is wheat and has eternal security, the other half is chaff.   Paul speaking on a back slidinging believer in sin,   1 corinthians 5:5 ""hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.""  Philippians 1:6 ""being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.""  John 10:28 29"" I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.""  Not believing on eternal security is much the same as believing in a works based faith, that you can do something about your salvation either for or against in the flesh and by your works. Making the complete atoning work of Christ worthless, its either saved or not, not saved than lost."
TrueChristian,3dwhz6,UnworthySeraph,4,Mon Jul 20 03:36:48 2015 UTC,"Can anything separate the elect from God's love and Christ's intercessory work? (Romans 8:31-39)  Jesus gives unto His sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of His hand. (John 10:27-29)  All that the Father gives to Jesus WILL come to Him, and those that come WILL IN NO WISE be cast out. (John 6:37)  If I have eternal life today (John 6:47), and I lose it tomorrow, how did I ever have eternal life?  In that passage, Jesus did not say ""He that believes has the promise of eternal life."" Jesus said, ""He who believes HAS eternal life.""      Jesus saved His people from their sins. (Matt 1:21; Rom 5:9, 19; Heb 1:3, 9:12, 10:10-14)  There is no possible way that one of His sheep could end up in hell.     Arminians teach that Christ died for both the sheep and the goats. Furthermore, the sheep can become goats and the goats can become sheep at any time irrespective of God's will. This takes away the saving and loving initiative of God and gives it to whomsoever can make up his mind to follow Christ for today but not necessarily tomorrow. This doctrine is certainly 'another gospel' as it insults God's love, Christ's work and the decrees of the Divine Council.    -George M Ella  Christians can backslide, but those who fall away permanently were never saved to begin with.

TrueChristian,3dwhz6,Sizzlecheeks,2,Tue Jul 21 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"This is something I've thought about a lot, and honestly I'm not sure where I stand. I too was raised with the belief in eternal security, and to this day I remember the phrase in which it was taught to me. It was something along the lines of ""Once you are a child of God, He will never let you go.""  I've always seen people that turn away from God as never being truly saved in the first place, mostly because of what I hear that convinced them. Generally, they seem to turn on lack of faith: they don't see any physical evidence, they are going through a rough patch and don't believe God is with them, or something along those lines. However, I can't be certain as I am not those people who have turned away, and I cannot judge their faith in Christ. If it is what it seems, and they did indeed have a lack of faith, than I would say they were never really saved in the first place, but I can't be sure.   James 2:1 seems to describe those with a lack of faith. ""My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality.""   Also James 1:6-8. ""But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.""  These verses are very similar to plenty of other verses that describe those  believing with partiality, but are those simply Luke Warm Christians that were never saved in the first place? Personally, I think faith is the deciding factor. You can believe in God all you want, but if you don't have the unshakable faith to back it up then it isn't worth much.  EDIT: Elaboration on some parts"
TrueChristian,3dwhz6,Sizzlecheeks,6,Mon Jul 20 03:58:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think James 2:1 is talking about people who are partial believers. In reading the rest of the chapter, he is talking about not treating people with partiality, or preference. As in, treating the rich man better than the poor beggar.   I'd also say doubting is different than not having real faith. I think every believer doubts at some point or another, and when a believer continues to trust God despite the doubts, thats when our faith grows.   God loves us to throw our doubts at Him and exercise faith in Him regardless.   In turn, and therefore, I think it's good to doubt at times, so that our faith can be increased. James is talking about people who have faith with ongoing doubts, they aren't really sure of what they are putting faith in. This is unstable and ""double-minded"" as the verse says.   Just my 2¢!"
TrueChristian,3dwhz6,jmj1970,3,Mon Jul 20 04:06:39 2015 UTC,"Genuine faith is supernatural in origin, i.e., from God.  ""No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day."" - John 6:44  If faith originated from me, I could be in danger of losing it.  But since it doesn't, I can't.  Jesus is called ""the author and finisher of our faith"" (Heb. 12:2).  In fact, God wrote a whole book about this, the book of Job.  The whole point of the book of Job is that God takes everything Job has except for 1 thing - his life.  What does Job say?  ""Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him."" (Job 13:5)  Because Job's faith transcends Job's intellect or personal stamina.  The NT tells us that the Holy Spirit creates life, transforms life, purifies, comforts and conforms sinners to Christ, equips, empowers, seals, secures and illuminates.  Frankly, not believing in eternal security is a slander against the very Breath of God, the Holy Spirit."

""They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."" - 1John 2:19  Or look at John 6 -- Christ performs miracles and people ""believe"" on Him.  But then the Lord tells people what is really involved in being His disciple and they utterly reject Him (John 6:66).  As to being permanently lost?  I don't think so, he's just another of the vast majority of lost humanity.  God is constantly giving 2nd, 10th and 1000th chances.  But be warned --  God says in Gen 6:3 ""My spirit shall not always strive with man"".  There does come a time when God says ""that's enough."""

However, in your Theses on Justification (1983) on this website it says plainly that believers have eternal assurance (paragraph 58). Which is it?  A:  Lutherans believe both are true and Scriptural: It is possible for a believer to fall from faith and lose salvation, and it is possible for a believer to have complete assurance of eternal salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. If this seems paradoxical to human reason, then (Lutherans say) this is only because the teaching of Scripture itself on this issue (as on many other issues) appears paradoxical to human reason.  For Lutherans, this is essentially a matter of properly distinguishing between Law and Gospel: Warnings against falling from faith are the strongest form of God's Law, intended to warn against ""carnal security"" based on ""good works"" or against the attitude that ""since I'm saved, I can do anything I want to do."" Assurances of God's constant and eternal love in Christ are the sweetest and purest form of Gospel, intended to comfort those who are plagued by their sins and by their failures to keep God's Law perfectly."

However  at the same time once we have experinced god in a real way and come to a certain point in our journy then we can't ""lose"" our salvation.

I praise God everyday that He saved me when I hated Him.  Please don't call that rape.   Matthew 24:13   God's elect persevere!

TrueChristian,3dyeei,sparticus299,9,Mon Jul 20 21:49:55 2015 UTC,"When did Christ institute praying to the dead/prayers for the dead,   Nobody ever said that was of His direct institution.  In any case, praying for the dead can be found in Maccabees.  2 Timothy 4:18 also provides support for the practice.     praying to the dead   Only if you mean the old sense of ""pray.""  We ask the Saints to pray for us.  The book of Revelation as well as immemorial Christian practice dating back to the Early Church.  It also seems quite unreasonable to reject it, as Jerome notes:   If the Apostles and Martyrs, while still in the body, can pray for others, at a time when they must still be anxious for themselves, how much more after their crowns, victories, and triumphs are won! One man, Moses, obtains from God pardon for six hundred thousand men in arms; and Stephen, the imitator of the Lord, and the first martyr in Christ, begs forgiveness for his persecutors; and shall their power be less after having begun to be with Christ? The Apostle Paul declares that two hundred three score and sixteen souls, sailing with him, were freely given him; and, after he is dissolved and has begun to be with Christ, shall he close his lips, and not be able to utter a word in behalf of those who throughout the whole world believed at his preaching of the Gospel? And shall the living dog Vigilantius be better than that dead lion?   placing statues and idols in the churches   Again, immemorial Christian practice is on our side.  We have consistent records (and indeed physical evidence) of icons in the earliest Christian churches.  Note that they have no power in themselves, but we merely apply the same principle applied in, say, the Pledge of Allegiance.  We give honor to an image (flag or icon) because we honor what it represents (nation or Christ), not because we think that the cloth or wood or paint is worth anything by itself.   purgatory   I cite Matthew 12:32   And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come   That implies that some sins can be forgiven and purged away in the world to come.   infant baptism   Again, immemorial Christian practice.  No sect that could be characterized as something even you would consider Christianity opposed it until the Reformation.   the rosary   A means of keeping track of prayer is bad?   papal infallibility   This turns on an argument I'll advance in a moment, but for a moment I'll simply advance the infallibility of the Church  Paul says in 1 Timothy 3:15   ""the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth""   This could not be correct if the Church were fallible.   Canon law   What is wrong with a system of law?   indulgences   I suspect you have no idea how these are supposed to work.  Moving on to what I spoke about earlier, your argument rests on an assumption of sola scriptura which is unwarranted.  The doctrine of ""Bible alone"" is self-defeating, as the doctrine is taught nowhere in the Bible.  Further, even conceding that it is taught in a purportedly canonical text, there is no way to determine that it is canonical, third, even conceding that a text can be found to support sola scriptura and it can be proven canonical by the Bible alone, then there is no guidance in the Bible on how to interpret said text."

Nothing, if it doesn't change or add to Gods Word (Roman Catholic canon law)    Indulgences: I suspect you have no idea how these are supposed to work.   Actually I have some idea about what they are, am I close? Indulgences (plenary to remove all of the sin, partial to remove part of it) are additional acts/works/penances used to bring about the remission and expiation of a temporal sin, discharging ""sin debt"" while on Earth. In other words Christ's perfect sacrifice, His propitiation wasn't sufficient to remove the punishment of sin for the Roman Catholic so you need indulgences and to go to purgatory to be ""refined"" through temporary punishment even though the doctrine of indulgences states that the sins have already been forgiven. Alongside the ""Treasury of Merit"" none of these ideas are Biblical and come from later man-made teachings and the papacy.  When it comes to sola scriptura, Scripture is God Breathed, while Roman Catholicism (and others who founded its teachings throughout the centuries) has added on to this with oral tradition and canonical law. When it comes to defining what is canonical and what isn't, both Roman Catholics and Protestants have left this up to councils and groups of theologians over the years and at the end of the day the 66 books are more than sufficient, Roman Catholicism sees the apocrypha as inspired, we don't. There were plenty of immemorial extra-biblical practices in the early church, just because they were historical or traditional it doesn't mean they were right. While the Bible alone is sufficient for all my doctrine, most other religions which see themselves as vaguely Christian add on to it, either with tradition, extra-Biblical writings or practices and it is simply man's attempt to improve upon or deviate from His Word, unnecessary at best, heretical at worst.   All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. ~ 2 Timothy 3:16-17"

Alongside the ""Treasury of Merit"" none of these ideas are Biblical and come from later man-made teachings and the papacy.   Purgatory is a whole different thing. We believe that we are sinners, and that we constantly live in a state of sin. Thus if we are sinners up until the moment we die, there by definition within our theology has to be some form of purification between death and entering heaven: this is where purgatory gets defined. Indulgences come from the the principle of vicarious satisfaction and the idea that works have some value in our own lives for such purpose.   and at the end of the day the 66 books are more than sufficient   There's certainly many things in the Apocrypha that even if you don't consider it inspired provided a lot of context to the greater biblical picture   There were plenty of immemorial extra-biblical practices in the early church, just because they were historical or traditional it doesn't mean they were right   Right, and early church councils condemned a ton of stuff.  Also, the Bible didn't exist when Paul/whoever wrote 2 Timothy was writing; it's debatable if any of the Gospels were even written. So what scripture could it be referring to? I agree with what that verse says, but it gets extrapolated way way way too much.  I'm not saying you have to agree with Catholicism. A lot of people don't. But Catholicism is 100% focused on Christ and salvation through him, and all of what we believe directly point back to this, and that's what makes us Christians."

As you said, that's what your theology teaches. To say that you need to be purified after death to atone for ""venial sins"" denies that Christ's suffering, death and atonement were insufficient.    it's debatable if any of the Gospels were even written   Actually it's very unlikely they were written and of course the complete Bible didn't exist but if you believe that God's Word is fully inspired by Him as the Apostles and disciples did and that Paul was commissioned by the will of God as a messenger of Jesus Christ alongside the other New Testament authors then whatever they wrote would be Scripture and inspired by God."

We're not being purified to atone, Christ's sacrifice was that. We're forgiven for the milk that we spilled on the floor, but there's still the spilled milk. Sin leaves an indelible mark on our souls, and Christ's sacrifice is the agent in which it is removed.  I agree with you on the scripture. It's more to the point that scripture can't just be scripture because it says its scripture. To a Catholic, the scripture is the product of the holy tradition that recognized it as such.

As to indulgences, do you understand the distinction between temporal and eternal punishment.   Scripture is God Breathed   Correct.   and at the end of the day the 66 books are more than sufficient   That doesn't prove that they are canonical under sola scriptura.  If you hold that no doctrine can come from outside the Bible, then what are you doing taking the canon from the same theologians and councils you reject as heretical elsewhere?  Besides, your argument amounts to begging the question.  You assume that the deuterocanon are not canonical and use that assumption to prove that the deuterocanon are not canonical.  No real point was made there.

TrueChristian,3dyeei,funny-original-name,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"Roman Catholicism is another gospel that is no gospel. (Gal 1:6-7). A true and consistent Roman Catholic believes that he is saved by his own willing and running, contrary to Rom 9:16, putting him outside of Christ (Gal. 5:4).  Nevertheless, many people inconsistently confess both grace and works.  Many Roman Catholics will ascribe their salvation wholly to God's grace, and yet they speak as though their salvation is conditioned on THEIR perseverance (not perishing in a state of mortal sin), THEIR staying on the sacramental treadmill, THEIR decision making abilities.  Those who think along these lines, though they may be saved, also need to realize that what they believe is not the truth, and need to repent of it.  If they repent upon being shown their error, we should treat them as brothers.  If they reject the gospel, we should treat them as we treat all false religionists."

Because the sufferings of the martyrs for the faith and for God’s law were thought to be very valuable, penitents used to turn to the martyrs to be helped by their merits to obtain a more speedy reconciliation from the bishops. Indeed, the prayers and good works of holy people were regarded as of such great value that it could be asserted that the penitent was washed, cleansed and redeemed with the help of the entire Christian people” (Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Apostolic Constitution on the Revision of Indulgences, chap. 3, 6, pp. 78,79)."

If they fail to respond in thought, word and deed to that grace, not only shall they not be saved, but they shall be the more severely judged” (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, chap. 2, 14, p. 337).  “By means of indulgences those members of the Church who are enduring their purification are united more speedily to the members who are in heaven ... holy Mother Church again recommends the practice of indulgences to the faithful. ... The remission of punishment by distribution from the Church’s treasury is incorporated into it. The Church recommends its faithful not to abandon or neglect the holy traditions of those who have gone before. They should be welcomed in a religious spirit as a precious treasure of the Catholic family and esteemed as such. ... The Church reminds them constantly of the things which should be given preference because they are necessary or at least better and more efficacious helps in the task of winning salvation” (Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Apostolic Constitution on the Revision of Indulgences, chap. 4, 10,11, p. 82).  “Just as Christ was sent by the Father so also he sent the apostles ... that they might preach the gospel to every creature and proclaim that the Son of God by his death and resurrection had freed us from the power of Satan and from death, and brought us into the Kingdom of his Father. But he also willed that the work of salvation which they preached should be set in train through the sacrifice and sacraments, around which the entire liturgical [ritualistic] life revolves. Thus by Baptism men are grafted into the paschal mystery of Christ. ... They receive the spirit of adoption as sons” (Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Chap. 1, I, 5,6, pp. 23-24).  “In that body the life of Christ is communicated to those who believe and who, through the sacraments, are united in a hidden and real way to Christ in his passion and glorification. Through baptism we are formed in the likeness of Christ: ‘For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body’ (1 Cor. 12:13). In this sacred rite fellowship in Christ’s death and resurrection is symbolized and is brought about” (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Chap. 1, 7, p. 327).  “For it is the liturgy through which, especially in the divine sacrifice of the Eucharist, ‘the work of our redemption is accomplished,’ and it is through the liturgy, especially, that the faithful are enabled to express in their lives and manifest to others the mystery of Christ and the real nature of the true Church” (Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Introduction, para. 2)."

For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures ~ 1 Corinthians 15:1-4  Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God. ~ Romans 5:1-2  For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. ~ Ephesians 2:8-9  (Edit for any non-Christians who might be reading this: In short the Gospel is simply the good news that Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose again on the third day, that now through His death and resurrection man has been reconciled to God and we can be saved from the wages of our sin/eternal hell by believing that Jesus Christ is Lord, knowing that no works will ever save us but faith in Christ alone will save us.)"

""If anyone says that the sinner is justified by faith alone, meaning that nothing else is required to cooperate in order to obtain the grace of justification and that it is not in any way necessary that he be prepared and disposed by the action of his own will, let him be anathema"" (Session 6: can. 9).

TrueChristian,3dyeei,stripes361,0,Mon Jul 20 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"Lutherans aren't far removed from Roman Catholics when it comes to sacraments, there are some differences when it comes to transubstantiation/consubstantiation but there's no conflict there because they're both wrong.  Teaching that one can lose their salvation is counter to the Gospel because it teaches that although God can save someone He cannot subsequently keep them (John 10:29, Romans 8:38-39). If you never had assurance of your salvation and had to continually seek penance by confessing to a priest to absolve sins then it would make Christ's promise of being the propitiation for our sins worthless (Hebrews 7:26-27).  Anathema: a thing devoted to God without hope of being redeemed, cursed, accursed.  But you would still consider someone who is anathema to your church to be saved??"

TrueChristian,3dwhbo,JIVEprinting,2,Wed Jul 22 01:30:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your situation.  I was certainly the first person to say ""I love you"" to my wife when we were dating and it took her much longer.  I understand that you don't believe you're using the word flippantly - and you may well be right - but I always counsel younger men not to use the L-word until two things are true: (1) you and the other person have a very clearly defined and mutual definition of love so that there is no confusion as to what you mean when you say it, and (2) you are ready to propose and commit your life to this person.  ONE  As to the first part, my personal definition of love incorporates the 3 uses of the word from Song of Songs - Raya, Ahava, and Dod.  Raya - This is the friendship aspect.  It says that you love doing things together and being around the other person no matter how exciting or mundane the day is.  Ahava - This is the commitment aspect.  It says that no matter how good or bad things get, and no matter how the other person treats you, you will always want to be with that person even to your own detriment, unconditionally.  Dod - This is the physical aspect.  It says that you are passionate about being with the other person intimately and long to have that close relationship in becoming one flesh.  Implications   If you have Raya and Ahava, but not Dod (as most marriages develop into about a year in), you'll end up feeling like life-long roommates and nothing more.  This can be very stressful and kill marriages. If you have Raya and Dod, but no Ahava, you will probably cheat on each other often.  You appreciate your time with her and will want to stay with her and you love the physical passion, but without the commitment, you'll look elsewhere for those things too. If you have Ahava and Dod, but no Raya, you'll feel like you're constantly antagonizing each other and have a broken household.   I know couples in all three of these circumstances and it's not pretty.  My wife and I lean toward the first situation through most of our lives (particularly after having our second kid ... and we now have 3).  It's good to be able to acknowledge where you're at in these phases before using the L-Word to make sure you know what you're saying and why.  TWO  In my view, saying the L-Word is tantamount to proposing.  It incorporates the Ahava, which is a life-long commitment.  1 Cor. 13 also says, ""Love never fails.""  It doesn't say, ""Love never fails, unless the other person is mean to you all the time, in which case you can fall out of love.""  1 John says that God is love.  If you share God in an intimate, uniting way with a person, to say that the relationship can break is to say that God can't hold you together any longer.  In all of this, never use this word until you are ready to propose.  That said, you don't have to wait until your proposal to say it.  Just because you determine (whether mistakenly or truthfully) that you love someone doesn't mean that person will love you back ... and a proposal should come when you understand that both of you are mutually on the same page as to the timing of marriage and its place in your relationship.  So, feel free to use the L-Word before you propose, but if you're not ready to buy a ring, don't say it.  If she returns the word to you with full knowledge of what you both mean when you say it, you should be ready to buy a ring that same day.  If you're not ready to ring shop on the spur of the moment if she happens to say it back, then you're not ready to say it.  (To be clear, that doesn't mean you have to ring shop that day - you could still wait months if you want; I'm just saying that you have to be committed enough to be willing to)."

Your other option is to move out of your parents's house and no longer be subject to their authority.  It will be tough having to pay your own way, but it is possible.  However, regardless of your decision, continue to pray for your family.  Ask your local prayer group to pray for you as well.

TrueChristian,3dudhf,JIVEprinting,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:58:03 2015 UTC,"Can you talk to one of your family's pastors about this? They know your family better than anyone here does. Besides, if possible, I think a mediating party is definitely the best way to tackle this. Plus, the ""sound, biblical advice"" you're looking is probably more like to come from someone who has real experience in Christian counseling, and not from strangers over the Internet!  As for my opinion: I have a missionary friend who went through a similar trial and, iirc, prayerfully decided to call off an engagement because of the other person's non-believing parents. That couple's rationale hinged on two things: One, the family is every Christian's most important ministry field. Two, we need to be willing to deny ourselves for ministry.  I'm seeing posts here saying things like, ""They can't control you,"" or ""You can't let them treat you like this."" That sounds like a mindset concerned with rights and pride. Christians should be ready to give up those things the sake of ministry... money, comfort, popularity, or, yes - even romantic options.  Your parents need you, so, so much more than your girlfriend of strong faith does, because your parents are trapped in sin. They're in such an ugly place right now, and God has placed you, a solid Christian, among them. You have special access to them that I doubt anyone else has, and breaking from them will cut that special access, and might very well leave them alone in their sin.  Obviously a lot of people will disagree with my missionary friend's decision and my advice - I don't blame them, nor would I honestly put it past you to still make a break with your parents! But those are my two cents. The best way to honor your parents is to minister to their spiritual needs, not blindly (or reluctantly) following their instructions.  (I certainly agree with others that you could be more self-supporting. You should submit to bad parents, but you shouldn't have to rely on them. Those are completely different things.)"

One thing I just have to say out of experience is don't let their threat of not paying for your college be the nail in the coffin. If anything, this threat is indicative of their true feelings, which are more likely than not, not aligned with God's. I would maybe consider bringing your girlfriend to have a serious talk with them, only because she seems to be the heart of the problem. Let them ask her questions and let her make a case for herself, because it doesn't sound like they have much to go by on their opinion of her.  If you have to give up their financial support to do what God wants you to do, then do not hesitate. Of course you should pray about it a good deal and seek council (as you have done by coming here) but ultimately if you have to make that choice do not be afraid to do so.  This is one of my all time favorite verses, as it is applicable in many cases. I think it is appropriate here.  John 15:18-19 ""If you find the godless world is hating you, remember, it got its start hating me. If you lived on the world's terms, the world would love you as its own. But since I picked you to live on God's terms and no longer on the world's terms, the world is going to hate you.  EDIT: I'm praying for you of course.

I have a son (15 months) and I know now how a true relationship between parents and children should be...just like God loves me I am to show and teach my son that I love him. But here is something that goes for anything. If God calls you, no one should stay in our way. Not even your parents. If you keep searching for God's will and to glorify Him with your life, you can trust Him to take care of your finances, not your parents.

TrueChristian,3dtqxo,redpandapaul,2,Sun Jul 19 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"One of the interesting things that sort of drives this point home happens in Revelation 21:9 during which towards the end of John's revelation, an angel comes to him saying ""hey come here and I will show you the bride of Christ""   Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.”     Well we know from the rest of the new testament, that whenever the bride of Christ is referred to, it's talking about the church.  So armed with that knowledge one might be expecting the angel to show John in his revelation a group of people... but he doesn't, he shows him a magnificent wonderful city.  And in reading it we often get lost on the wonder of the city and forget that he just called that city, the ""Bride, the wife of the Lamb"".  But if you think about it, when you want to show what it's like to be a group of people in the future, showing a portrait might not give as good of a grasp of what it's like to be that people than showing the home where that person will live.  Take modern day celebrities, when you see a photo of a celebrity you see their clothes and appearance, but if you watch one of those shows where they show you around one of the celebrities homes, you get a much fuller picture of what life is like for that person.  So too, in the bible, the description of our future home gives us a much better picture into our future life than a description of the people itself, for people come in a kaleidoscope of God's varied designed, but a glimpse of the city gives us a glimpse of what it might be like to be a member of that people living life in their final home.  So it's very true, ""what is a city without its inhabitants"", it is devoid of life, a ghost town.  And what is a people, the church of God without a final home, the city of God?  We are a people passing through, sojourners in a foreign land."

Also there was no more sea.   Christ’s Millennial Kingdom is over and eternity begins. Man, earth and the universe are back where they started, in the  additional dimension of the Kingdom of God. The sea is the first of seven evils that John said would not exist in the new  creation, the others being death, sorrow, crying, pain, night, and the curse.   2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.   This is what we think of as heaven; in the holy New Jerusalem we have something totally unique, a sinless pure community  of righteousness.   3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.   This is after Christ’s thousand year reign, all sin being removed, God the Father will dwell among His people, and they will  experience intimate fellowship with Him. This is the supreme blessing of New Jerusalem.    4 “And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”   This is the final reversal of the curse; all of those former experiences that came with the curse will be gone forever.   5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”   God completes His work of making all things new and they will stay new; nothing will wear out, no one will age or atrophy.   6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts.   Ephesians 1:10:   that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth—in Him.   And the Lord says: “It is done!”   7 “He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.

TrueChristian,3dsewf,SovereignPaladin,12,Sun Jul 19 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"We have a vast amount of manuscripts and manuscript fragments of the text. Some are full books of the Bible or even larger. Some are small as a few words / verses. These manuscripts and fragments are all copies (or more accurately copies of copies of ...) of the original autographs (these are in Hebrew and Greek). We don't have the original autographs. Over the centuries scribes painstakenly copied the text. Other scribes translated the texts into other languages.  The process of determining (to the best of our ability) the original text with all of these manuscripts (which are in HUGE agreement) is the process of textual criticism. We have so many more manuscripts today than the translators of KJV had (which is not the oldest translation into English by the way), but as you can tell our modern translations largely agree in meaning with the KJV. The ending of Mark and part of John 8 are two notable exceptions (most modern translations bracket / omit those, because the evidence is so huge that they were not in the original). This is a huge field in itself. From this process we come up with critical editions of the original text (see the UBS Greek New Testament for example).  This gets us to the point of translation. Most modern translations prefer to translate directly from the Greek and Hebrew (of course!) and depending on the translation commitee may do their own textual critisicism through the translation process (not just accepting UBS's decisions for example). NIV, NASB, and HSCB and most other modern translations translate directly from the original languages. Others are merely upates of previous work. I believe the ASV depended on the KJV quite a lot. ESV is a revision of the RSV.  The translation process of any kind of document is difficult, since languages are different and we do want to be understand what is written (I don't speak Chinese, so even if a Chinese translation is ""perfect"" its useless to me. I also don't speak 14th century English, so that is not as helpful, even though it is more helpful than the Chinese one). This is why we have so many modern translations - each has its own philosphy about how to maintain the meaning of the text but also not make it nonsensical in the target language. But, even though no translation is perfect, most are adequate."

TrueChristian,3dsewf,tchillarke,3,Sun Jul 19 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"This is actually one of my favorite subjects, how we got our English bibles.   Wikipedia is a great resource for learning about how we got the Bible translations we have today.   There are two main manuscript types used in our modern translations. The Alexandrian text type, and the Byzantine text type.   The Alexandrian texts are texts that have the same style of writing due to them originating from a particular geographical area.   Alexandrian texts come out of Alexandria, Egypt. Byzantines come out of the city of Antioch (read about Antioch in Acts!)   Your dad is actually wrong about the KJV being the oldest. The oldest manuscripts we have are those of Alexandrian type. However, we have more byzantine manuscripts in our possession.   The NIV, NASB, NLT, ESV, and pretty much every modern translation we have is based off of the Alexandrian texts for the sole reason that they are the oldest, and hence regarded as the purest.   The KJV was translated and compiled  from a group manuscripts of Byzantine type by a guy named Erasmus around 1500 AD.   Erasmus wanted to harmonize all the manuscripts and put then all into Greek to prove that the Latin Vulgate (put out by the Catholic Church) wasn't the only reputable translation (the Catholic Church was beginning to be looked down upon because of its corruption, and Erasmus wanted to provide a translation that, essentially, people could trust). Although he ended up having to backtranslate some passages from the Vulgate into Greek to complete his text, but that's another story.   The KJV was translated using the English bible translated by William Tyndale from the textus receptus, the Latin Vulgate, the textus receptus, and other byzantine manuscripts.   If I remember right, I could count on two hands the number of modern English bibles translated from the Byzantine texts or textus receptus, while there are numerous, probably in the hundreds, translations based off the Alexandrian types.   I can go into more depth if you like, but this should give you a basic understanding!   Edit: yes, the translations you listed were translated from the originals directly (gathering from several manuscripts to create a critical) but it's important to keep in mind why, say, the NIV says different things than the ESV.   It really depends on who is doing the translating and why they want to do it. As another redditor pointed out, Greek words can be ambiguous, so they are often translated into different English words. (cool note: English is the most specific language, which creates a problem when translating from a language like Greek or Latin into English. Where Latin might have only one word word for ""run,"" English has words like ""jog,"" ""run,"" and ""sprint."") this is why they say different things even though they are translate from manuscripts of the same text type."

TrueChristian,3dsewf,eddrix,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"I would argue that older translations are less likely to be accurate because modern scholarship have many more of the ""originals"" (or as close to original texts of the Bible that we can get) and a better understanding of ancient languages.

TrueChristian,3dsewf,Airglow26,3,Sun Jul 19 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"Here's info on Modern English translations or Middle English and Old English if you consider them English enough. Frankly I find the KJV english so foreign to what I speak today that it wouldn't be much worse to go further back.  The Tyndale Bible is the first translated from original languages directly.  Older when it comes to translation almost certainly means less acutate because the continued discoveries of ancient texts and their variations allows newer translations to incorporate greater numbers of manuscripts. I don't have specific numbers offhand but modern translations use far more. Add to that the evolution of our language, words change so what may be clear to someone in 1611, not so much to someone in 2015.  Keep in mind too that the KJV was printed with the Deuterocanon so for those who argue it is a perfect translation that cannot be corrupted, they must make sure to include those books that many protestants do not.  Also worth noting is that there have been revisions to the KJV.  You can check out many versions free online, or buy hardcopies, if you are so inclined though I wouldn't recommend them for daily use for the same reason I wouldn't recommend the KJV, namely that I speak modern English.  Lastly, if adherence to the ancient sources is your goal (and it is a great one), you can't do better than studying the Greek and Hebrew yourself. Short of that I like the Amplified Bible for a vaguely similar experience of the messiness of translation."
TrueChristian,3dsewf,eddrix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've been told:  There are some words and phrases that can't be directly translated so it's down to the translator to put it as close to the original text as possible. People do this in different ways leading to some differences in translation.   I'm on mobile at the moment but somewhere online there is a diagram of how the translations relate to each other.   One thing to bear in mind is that the Catholic Church had a much larger bible than we do today. Priests and the like decided that some of the books were not divinely inspired (from God) and therefore shouldn't be included. Leading to a number of different versions as well.  As God reminds us in Revelation we are not to change, add to or take away from the word. In my opinion this extends to translations like the message because it strays much too far from the original text. Now I'm not saying that if you read The Message that your a sinner but more that it's something to consider.   This information is just out of my head and I haven't done much reading on the subject although it is one of interest to me, don't take what I've said as the truth I may be wrong as as always test it against the bible.

TrueChristian,3dsewf,VirgilDurden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:42:53 2015 UTC,"Every language has its own idioms and parlance that A. can change over time and B. does not necessarily translate well.    For an example, what does the expression ""Blood is thicker than water"" mean?  To many nowadays, it means that familial (blood) ties are stronger than other relationships with non-family people.  Originally, though, it was paraphrasing ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"", meaning that bonds with people we choose (and make covenants with) supersede family ties.  And as I mentioned above, every dialect has idioms that just don't translate well into other languages.  It is my belief (and experience) that each successive translation tries to account for these two facts and present the most accurate translation in the modern language that can be provided.  Is it 100% perfect?  No, but if you get 2-3 different translations (especially those with good footnotes), you can generally get a good picture of what was trying to be conveyed.  The only other option would be to learn Koine Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic and translate yourself!  No disrespect to your father, or any KJV-only people, but limiting oneself to one translation gives an inaccurate and incomplete picture of what God was trying to convey; and if we have to pick just one translation, why pick the one that was written when Shakespeare was around?  We don't talk like that anymore!

It's been reviewed by Tex Mars and other KJVonly folks and they are utterly decimated by it.   But no, he's been misinformed. The first good translation was done by Jerome around 400AD--it was in Latin, called the Vulgate. The first balanced English translation wasn't the KJV it was the Geneva Bible, preceding the KJV by 50 years. The KJV totally built on that pioneering work.   What's important?

If you're married, you are supposed to have sex regularly. If you can't afford to have a kid, or another one, it would be sinful to do so fully knowing that you wouldn't be able to provide for them.

TrueChristian,3dq6ev,CowboyBigBoss,4,Sat Jul 18 19:18:41 2015 UTC,"I think I can provide some perspective on the Catholic view.   The main passages used by the Roman Catholic Church (which I'm not affiliated with) condemning birth control are Genesis 38:8-10[1] (the story of Onan ‘spilling his seed’) and multiple verses that talk about children being a gift from God, including Genesis 1:28 which says ""Be fruitful and multiply"".   The Catholic Church generally does not reference the verses you included for the same reason you mentioned: they don't provide enough to establish the immorality of contraception.  Rather, the teaching is understood through natural law.  We take what we know about marriage and sex and draw conclusions.  For example, we understand that there are two purposes of sex: the so called ""babies and bonding"".  Bonding is made up of pleasure, emotional connection, intimacy, consent, etc.  Babies is exactly that, procreation.    We run into problems when we intentionally take away one of those aspects.  For example, can you imagine if a couple intentionally took steps to remove one of the bonding aspects? Surely, intentional removal of pleasure, consent, emotional connection, or intimacy would be gravely immoral.  The same, the Church teaches, is true for procreation.  Intentional removal of the procreation aspect would also be immoral.    Many will say ‘just use Natural Family Planning’ (again, I'm not Catholic)… but in my opinion there is no moral difference between it and 'coutis interuptus'/‘pulling out’. The motive behind both is to avoid pregnancy… it’s just a different means to the same end.    But surely the means of an act impacts its morality? If I work 40hrs a week to provide for my family, that is a morally good means to the end of providing for my family.  If I steal food from a grocery store, that is a morally evil way to provide for my family.  Christians generally would not say that these are both simply ""a different means to the same end."" So, therefore, the means are very important in moral acts.    For another perspective on the NFP question: Link  It's pretty difficult to understand this issue so I'll try to answer any questions."

So, therefore, the means are very important in moral acts.   I agree that the means of an act can impact its morality in different circumstances. In your example it certainly does, and in the example of euthenesia vs natural death in the link you gave it also definitely does. However I do not see the difference between the intent shown when using either of the two methods of contraception I listed, intent being the operative word.  The link you gave has this in bold in the first paragraph: ""... another human being may never be used as a mere “means;” people are meant to be loved, never merely used."" If coutis interruptus is an example of using someone rather than loving them, how is NFP any different? The intent of both acts is exactly the same... that is to avoid pregnancy.  Also, just wondering as a Catholic how you reconcile what Paul said about sex?  Again thanks for the response, appreciate the input."

However I do not see the difference between the intent shown when using either of the two methods of contraception I listed, intent being the operative word.   Now you're really hitting the nail on the head.  Intent is absolutely  a vital ways to understand this issue. But first, some background:  The Catholic moral tradition (claiming its roots in Scripture and being developed by theological greats such as Thomas Aquinas) identifies 3 sources of morality: the act itself, the end goal, and the circumstances.  Intent falls into the second source.  However, all these sources must be good for a moral act to be good.    In this case, the intent is the same, yes.  But we have to consider the whole of morality, which leads us to realize that the act itself is different.  NFP has a different moral value than ""pulling out"" because the act is different although the intent is the same.     If coutis interruptus is an example of using someone rather than loving them, how is NFP any different?   NFP is different because it actually seeks to understand the woman's body and work with it rather than against it.  It brings the couple closer in intimacy rather than simply interrupting the process.   I don't think I have much to say about Paul here.  He tells us to abstain ""except for a time...for prayer"" I don't see why that couldn't account for NFP.  EDIT: Forgot to include this link: http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a4.htm"
TrueChristian,3dq6ev,coolwhhip_,2,Sat Jul 18 13:53:30 2015 UTC,"Very interesting perspective, not sure I agree with the basis for some of it but can see where you're coming from. Two more things:   I don't think I have much to say about Paul here. He tells us to abstain ""except for a time...for prayer"" I don't see why that couldn't account for NFP.   He says the reason for abstaining should be for prayer... not to avoid pregnancy (which if I were to guess I'd say is the actual reason most use NFP).  Which I think relates to my next question. The following is a quote from the first link you gave:   Could a couple engage in natural family planning with a “contraceptive mentality”? They could. And they, too, are called to resist the temptation to do this. All of us are called to embrace the cross of Jesus, no matter our vocation.   Is this saying that NFP shouldn't be used with intention to avoid avoiding pregnancy? If so then why is it promoted, let alone mentioned by the RCC? If it is wrong to use NFP in such a way, then the whole concept of NFP is once again flawed. Of course I may have completely misunderstood the quote."

There are good reasons to avoid pregnancy, at least in the short term.  Spacing out births for health reasons, grave financial situation, etc.  The quote that /u/dyskutant provided makes this point as to why NFP has the same intent as contraception: ""It cannot be denied that in each case the married couple, for acceptable reasons, are both perfectly clear in their intention to avoid children and wish to make sure that none will result.""

TrueChristian,3dq6ev,dyskutant,4,Sat Jul 18 13:16:15 2015 UTC,Ok. I will give you longer answer. It seems I was downvoted for a reason.
TrueChristian,3dq6ev,dyskutant,2,Sat Jul 18 13:43:39 2015 UTC,"The motive behind both is to avoid pregnancy… it’s just a different means to the same end.   That is the point!  It's not the end, avoiding a pregnancy, that is immoral.  It is the means, artificial contraception, sodomy, pulling out etc. that are immoral.  The simple desire not to have kids with a particular sex act is not immoral.  As Humanae Vitae notes:   Neither the Church nor her doctrine is inconsistent when she considers it lawful for married people to take advantage of the infertile period but condemns as always unlawful the use of means which directly prevent conception, even when the reasons given for the later practice may appear to be upright and serious. In reality, these two cases are completely different. In the former the married couple rightly use a faculty provided them by nature. In the later they obstruct the natural development of the generative process. It cannot be denied that in each case the married couple, for acceptable reasons, are both perfectly clear in their intention to avoid children and wish to make sure that none will result.   As such, the mere fact that two actions have the same result does not make them morally equivalent.  Notably, NFP is abstaining for periods of time by mutual consent.  That's the idea."
TrueChristian,3dq6ev,dyskutant,4,Sat Jul 18 13:49:15 2015 UTC,"Good quote. That's the kind of angle I've been looking for. Not saying I agree with it... but it sure makes a lot more sense to me.  I'll ask you as well, how do you combine the concept of abstaining within NFP and what Paul had to say about sex? He said we shouldn't abstain, only ""perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer"". He doesn't say the main reason to abstain is so that you can avoid pregnancy, which NFP infers, but rather to pray. I doubt the main reason most Catholics abstain from sex while following NFP is for prayer. If I were a betting man I'd say most abstain to avoid pregnancy. That or it's suspiciously coincidental haha."
TrueChristian,3dq6ev,dyskutant,2,Sat Jul 18 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"Christians have long regarded it as licit to abstain totally.  Notably, you're using a looser translation.   Young's Literal puts it:   Defraud not one another, except by consent for a time, that ye may be free for fasting and prayer, and again may come together, that the Adversary may not tempt you because of your incontinence;   The KJV:   Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.   The Douay-Rheims:   Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer; and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.   The NRSV:   Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.   All of them rely on this idea of ""defrauding"" or ""depriving,"" implying some breach of the marital debt.  Further, I think that reading that as prohibiting all abstention except for prayer is too restrictive a reading of what was intended.  For example, would Paul have held it as licit to abstain because of an injury making having sex dangerous?  I think so."

TrueChristian,3dq6ev,_Lucky_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:30 2015 UTC,"Just read that link. Good read.  Some thoughts: I agree it's inherently 'good' for sex to result in procreation and provide bonding, however it's not necessarily immoral to have sex knowing procreation were not to happen (if it were, then using NFP or having sex with a sterile wife would also be immoral).  Edit: I know this point has already been made before, just clarifying. (:  Therefore it comes down to the morality of the act itself.  The RCC simply says that using 'a faculty provided them by nature' is moral, whereas any alternative is not. However, just because something is not 'a faculty provided ... by nature' does not make it inherently immoral. Just because x = y doesn't mean x ≠ z.  In reference to contraceptives, the RCC says 'they obstruct the natural development of the generative process' (which has nothing to do with natural law). This reason isn't good enough, as many other practices condoned by the Church also obstruct different forms of natural development. Again, natural development is different to natural law. E.g. performing a heart transplant obstructs the natural development of the cardiovascular process.  I'm not saying all this means contraceptives are moral... far from it. My point is that there needs to be a better reason for objecting to them.  ...  I'd think a good example to use is abortion vs miscarriage. They both result in the same thing (death of child), but are caused by different means. There is generally nothing immoral about a natural miscarriage, whereas an abortion is wrong as it is murder.  In regards to sex, there is also generally nothing wrong with sex during natural periods of infertility, but is there any reason for using contraceptives to be immoral?"

Therefore, if you actually nurse your children for a couple years each (which has a lot of health benefits) it is unlikely that you will end up with more than five or six children even if you marry extremely young.

In 1968 Pope Paul VI rejected the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control established by his predecessor, Pope John XXIII and condemned birth control as a sin.   The problem arises because Pope Paul VI was speaking ex cathedra - which means that he was speaking the infallible words of God.  This means that no subsequent pope can change them otherwise the whole concept that a pope can be infallible gets destroyed. No one wants to go that far, so they are really stuck.  Allow birth control and a major Roman Catholic doctrine is destroyed with many rammifications. Oppose birth control and you're destroying the world.

A lot of non-barrier methods have this as a secondary effect after the primary means of preventing conception. Some groups consider this abortifacient and I'm inclined to agree.

And yes, your founder was explicitly against contraception.   this is a most disgraceful sin. It is far more atrocious than incest and adultery. We call it unchastity, yes, a Sodomitic sin. For Onan goes in to her; that is, he lies with her and copulates, and when it comes to the point of insemination, spills the semen, lest the woman conceive. Surely at such a time the order of nature established by God in procreation should be followed. Accordingly, it was a most disgraceful crime to produce semen and excite the woman, and to frustrate her at that very moment. (LW 7.20-21)."

TrueChristian,3dq6ev,dyskutant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Because they use a bad hermeneutic. Basically, Presbyterians use the hermeneutic of assuming or extrapolating Scripture a little beyond what it actually says, while Baptists believe in only taking Scripture for what it actually says, and holding extrapolations as tentative.  For example, Presbyterians believe in Covenant Theology, which is nowhere actually confirmed in Scripture, but they take some verses and stretch them a little and apply them to a framework to come up with that view. Baptists are credobaptist, because the Bible only ever explicitly talks about baptism after repentance.  So you see the same thing in Calvin's statement, where the verses he references don't ever say it's a sin to pull out (Onan's sin was deliberate failure to give his deceased brother's wife children, per Levitical law), and it is also an extrapolation to say that having sex for recreational purposes only within marriage is sin (for example, the Bible gives a blessing saying ""May your wife's breasts always please you"".

In my current game (where my dynasty holds Ireland, Wales, and parts of France and Spain), France won the original First Crusade for Jerusalem, always getting whupped in a jihad a few years later. Crusades for Jerusalem II - V were all about restoring the Kingdom to its French titleholders. My kings helped them do it each time, for the sweet +30 opinion bonus from the Crusader trait the glory of God.  So the 1280s roll around, the Holy Land had been back under the Fatimid Sultanate for ~40 years, and the pope calls a Sixth Crusade for Jerusalem. Being the good Christian king I am who totally didn't assassinate his stupid brother that one time, I joined, called up my fleets, assembled my retinue and personal levies, hired some mercenaries, and sailed for the Holy Land.  I noted that there weren't any of the usual French and Holy Roman Empire armies that always arrived before me, but I figured they were probably preoccupied with their respective revolts back home.  So, I spent the next few years whacking Arab armies and besieging holdings. Unlike the previous crusades, there weren't any 20,000+ strong Arab doomstacks, and the only other Christian army that joined me was a Papal one of around 7,000. I basically had the war all to myself after a while. Again, weird.

A common theory that I've heard was that Joseph was a widower with other children.   There are also things like the fact that Jesus entrusted Mary to John, rather than one of his siblings (also lending credence to the idea that Joseph was older, had already been married, and had passed away by this point). If Mary WAS the mother of these ""brothers"", it wouldn't make sense for her to be taken care of by someone not related to her by blood.   Hope that helps.

When Jesus went missing when he was 12 Mary and Joseph went looking for him. Where were the other children? Furthermore, Aramaic has no separate word for brother as it could also mean cousin. Abraham is called Lot's brother even though he isn't.  Furthermore, the ""brothers"" are never called children of Mary and are more logically children of another Mary. Also, 1 Corinthians 15:6 states that he had more than 500 brothers and sisters. How does that work?  Finally, Ezekiel 44:2 states that ""no man shall pass through the gate by which the Lord enters the world"". Given that Jesus is God, no other people entered the world the way he did.  Lastly, there is an ancient consensus that Mary remained a virgin forever. This would be strange if there were early christian accounts of brothers and sisters of blood related to Jesus. It is therefore safe to say that Jesus had no siblings."

St. Basil the Great once said ""lovers of Christ do not tolerate hearing that the Mother of God ever ceased to be a virgin"".  St. Thomas Aquinas defended the perpetual virginity in his Summa Theologica. Mary is often compared to the Ark of the Covenant, holding the staff(Jesus as High Priest), the Ten Commandments(Jesus as the New Convenant) and the manna(Jesus as the Bread of Life). As the Ark of the Convenant was not used for anything other than its intended purpose, Mary's intended purpose was to give birth to our Savior. Having other children detracts from the fullness of that purpose. That's why people get upset when people dismiss her perpetual virginity."

TrueChristian,3dmw86,eddrix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:24:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it was not only to give birth but also to raise Him and have Him at the center of her life. She did die after the crucifixion but it is not know how much after that it happened."

TrueChristian,3dmw86,zip99,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:42:39 2015 UTC,If the Ark of the Covenant also carried your lamb meat it would detract from it's holy purpose. Similar idea.
TrueChristian,3dmw86,zimm3r16,4,Sat Jul 18 04:12:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing the analogy. The Ark of the Covenant represented to the Hebrews the presence of God. While Mary was chosen for an incredible purpose she most certainly did NOT (!!!!) represent God's presence.   But let's put that aside for a moment.   Suppose for example that after Jesus Christ was born, Mary became a victim of a horrible rape and murder crime.   How in any way, shape or form would or could that change what Jesus Christ accomplished? The answer is it wouldn't.  And what value is there in the Christian faith outside of what Jesus Christ accomplished? Again, the answer is none.   Mary may or may not have been a virgin at the time of her death. My concern is that by focusing on this point, and making much of it, we risk losing site of the only thing that really matters."
TrueChristian,3dmw86,zip99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:42:33 2015 UTC,This does matter. Also rape isn't an issue because a it didn't happen and that's a huge difference then consensual sex. Also Mary did represent God's presence. God was in her. It's very clear when she visited Elizabeth she represented God's presence. She was the spouse of the holt spirit.

""Homosexuality is wrong, so we're going to try and keep you from being able to engage in it."" or ""This is a Christian nation, and so it's going to uphold Christian principles.""  The reason that's taken as judgmental is because it's the exact opposite of Christ's approach.  Live a life of service. Especially serving those you disagree with.

For example you can believe that a fork is a spoon. It does not make the fork a spoon and some people will not believe you.  Those who hear the truth and do not believe do so by choice. Its casting your pearls before swine trying to explain to them the truth.  However in another verse we are told to be a gentle as doves and wise as serpents.  So you should approach the situation with the attitude that what you have to say may not be received by the audience. Knowing this you will be able to explain the truth and let them decide if they believe.  Some good advice is to find out what they believe/think of the subject and go from there.

A sneak peek at Revelation 16:   15 ""Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.""   This isn’t talking about clothes, but about receiving glorified bodies; a quick look at 2Cor.5:1-4 tells us this.   For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven, if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life.    A closer look at this passage makes it abundantly clear:   For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed,   This is our earthly body of flesh, the one our spirit was born into.   we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.   This is our immortal body, the one those in the Body of Christ will receive at the resurrection.    For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven,   Our spirit groans in our body of flesh wanting to be in its glorified immortal body.   if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked.   Our spirit does not need a body, but it will be ""naked"" if it does not receive its glorified body.   For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed,   Our spirit is burdened and groans because it wants out of our fleshly body not to be without a body (naked) but to be in its glorified body.   that mortality may be swallowed up by life.   Our spirit wants out of our dying bodies of flesh and in our immortal body.  So when our Lord says: “lest he walk naked” Jesus means without a glorified body. Our Lord urges His faithful believers to  be watchful and remain in the righteousness of Christ, you will either be clothed with the righteousness of Christ (glorified  body) or you will be naked."
TrueChristian,3dk429,stripes361,3,Thu Jul 16 23:53:52 2015 UTC,"Instead of arguing about him not researching, can you cite your claims on how easy genetic modification is?"
TrueChristian,3dk429,stripes361,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:08:26 2015 UTC,"I think there are some important questions to ask when interpreting Scripture   Who was the author's original audience? What did the author intend to convey? What would the original audience understood this passage(s) to have meant? What was going on during that time?   Obviously we don't get the whole picture of the historical context, but in many cases we do. In this case we should remember that John was writing to some churches in the Roman province of Asia amidst persecution. The beast is often interpreted as the Roman government, specifically Nero.  In fact the number 666 is a gematria, which was an ancient practice. The Hebrew name for Nero Ceasar (NRWN QSR) adds up to six hundred and sixty-six. Remember, John states that ""it is the number of a man."" NRW QSR, an alternative spelling adds up to 616, which is a textual variant in this verse.  Now some scholars may disagree with the above assesment, that the original audience would not have understood that. But, even so, whatever meaning we get from the text, if it didn't mean it to the original audience, it can't mean it to us. That doesn't mean we can't apply it to our specific situation, but if we get some general principle that would not apply in the original situation it's probably incorrect. This is the process of hermeneutics."

An interesting read is the book of Enoch (there are arguments for and against its inspiration) it goes into great detail on the preflood world and the demons that fell.

I think there may be elements of goodness within Greek polytheism, as there are in all religions, put there by God as seeds of His truth, waypoints to the only truly complete religion, Christianity.

There is no evidence to suggest the Greek gods are or ever were at work in the world.  Since you're here, I'll compare your source material to ours: the Bible. It makes falsifiable claims / descriptions that have been proved by any reasonable standard, such as Luke's descriptions of the ancient world as he traveled around and the ministry and crucifixion of Jesus. This indicates the authors were actually in the places they described, saw the things they report, and lends them credibility. I have walked in the places described in Acts and seen where Paul debated the Stoics, where he was shouted down by silversmiths whose livelihood depended on Artemis worship. There is also a host of prophecy that has been fulfilled, and a startling level of consistency for a series of books and letters written by so many different authors over so many thousands of years.  My honest opinion, since you asked for it, is that you are deceived and enslaved to a false view of the world, of history, of yourself, and of your Creator. I would entreat you to seek the truth about ""the unknown god"" (who is known quite well here, as he was by Paul) and find freedom."

TrueChristian,3dgvow,VerseBot,5,Sat Jul 18 07:40:38 2015 UTC,"As a senior male in college, I'd like to share a few things I've learned in the past few years.    1) Often at college, it is easy to sympathize with Daniel in Babylon.  Daniel was thrust into a society in which his values stood in contrast to his environment.  College can feel like this, for it often times seems like, especially at a public university, that others with similar values don't exist.  They do, but one must look for them.  Therefore, when looking for a potential spouse, I think it's wise to start thinking about where you might meet women with the values you desire.  I made the mistake of looking in the wrong places in my earlier years of university, and at times I felt lost.  I'd encourage you to get involved with Christian Organizations on campus.  2) The most effective way to fight temptation is spiritual passion.  Boundaries without purpose are ineffective, and will exhaust you.  Now, boundaries are a good thing, but spiritual passion will be your ticket to not only sexual purity but discipleship.  For a more articulate (and more interesting!) perspective on this, I highly recommend this sermon by Tim Keller.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07RF_DI6t0c"

TrueChristian,3dgvow,mefeman,3,Sun Jul 19 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"Another common way to lose faith is when you are faced with a lot of questions about life and good and evil and ... and you're not equipped to answer them from a Christian perspective if you grew up really sheltered. e.g. morality is a personal decision, all religions lead to God.  Also people will try and convince you that science is in opposition to religion [Christianity] and that it has proven that the Bible is wrong and Christianity false or irrelevant. IF evolution is true then you don't need God because there is nothing spiritual anywhere."
TrueChristian,3dgvow,MRH2,5,Thu Jul 16 11:15:29 2015 UTC,"The Bible encourages us to resist, fight against, or otherwise man up against temptation. Except when it comes to sex. It is the only temptation we are told to flee from. The safest course is no dating. The next safest is never to be alone together. Spend time with a group of friends and you can all keep eachother accountable. Decide now what those boundaries are. It will be a lot easier to tell yourself no when you're tempted to go to dinner just the 2 of you than to tell yourself to stop when you've been making out for an hour. Good luck.

TrueChristian,3dgvow,rivkachava,3,Thu Jul 16 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"From a Christian perspective, the only reason to date someone is for getting married eventually. It seems logical to me that this means it is only right to date someone who is also a Christian, since we are supposed to be equally yoked in marriage.   As for what boundaries you would set - that isn't as clear in the Bible. My opinion is that it isn't good to test your limits. While attraction is always going to happen, intentionally causing yourselves to lust while not yet married doesn't seem like a good idea. It isn't supposed to be ""how far can we go without breaking the rules,"" it should be ""how can we help each other as Christians to not sin?""   The most important thing in college is to join and regularly attend a local church. Get to know the pastor and make some friends, at least a few that aren't other college students. It really helps to keep a healthy perspective on life, that college is really just a small segment of society and a few short years of life. Sometimes it's very easy for the social scene of campus to start feeling like the whole world. At least for me."
TrueChristian,3dgvow,of_skies_and_seas,2,Thu Jul 16 06:56:46 2015 UTC,"The way to go, number one, is to get into a strong Christian community and get involved. There are many, many Christian groups at most universities. Join one (or more!) and get involved. Go to Bible studies.  Keep reading the word of God every day (are you not yet? Start!). Show your love for God by honoring him throughout your life.  You can casually date girls of all sorts, but make very sure you know what your physical, emotional and relational boundaries are. For instance:   don't kiss a girl until you're exclusive with her never go on a second date with someone who doesn't go to church (or won't join you) never commit yourself to someone who's not committed to Christ communicate clearly your boundaries with a girl once you two become an exclusive item (share yours and have her share hers, then respect hers and insist that she respect yours) maintain purity outside of your relationship, too (lots of men and women struggle with lusting after other people, not just their SO's, and pornography is unfortunately very common--if it's an issue for you, get yourself over to /r/nofapchristians and start dealing with that issue, because no Christian girl of any caliber wants to date a guy who's into porn)   With that done, you just need to decide what your personal conscience tells you is wrong, and then communicate that to her. I found my conscience violated when I would kiss my girlfriend sitting down (on the couch, etc.) - that's perhaps not where you'd set your boundaries, but that's fine, you set your own. Do not under any circumstances assume that you as a man will have stricter or looser standards for physical boundaries than your girlfriend; some girls are comfortable to take things farther than you are, and some aren't comfortable to even kiss.  One last thing. Keep in mind that your kisses mean something. When you kiss a girl (I'm using this as an example, but it applies to hand-holding, intercourse, anything) you are communicating something. Be careful--don't lie to a girl or to yourself by how your body and hers interact.  I hope this helps. Keep your head up--you're probably going to do great!!"
TrueChristian,3dgvow,I_am_very_attractive,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"/u/thewarehouse mentioned ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"", below and I agree with the recommendation, but I thought I'd expound upon it a little to explain why I recommend the book.  The title of the book is a little misleading.  Its premise is not that you should give up all dating, but that the modern way of dating is counter-productive to the search for a husband or wife (which is - or should be - the ultimate goal of dating in the first place.  Otherwise, why do it?)  The book's author, Joshua Harris, proposes ""courting,"" which more closely resembles the dating your parents or grandparents did when they were growing up, as opposed to the ""marriage-lite"" type relationships your peers are having.  Harris' suggestions go beyond the obvious ""no sexual contact"" advice to things a little less obvious like, ""don't drive each other's cars,"" ""avoid being alone together,"" ""keep even the non-sexual physical contact to a bare minimum - i.e. side hugs only.  He's not super focused on giving an exact blueprint for what sort touching is fine and which is verboten, or exactly which activities should be prohibited; rather he provides a few examples to help illustrate an overall premise and reveal the true pitfall most folks stumble into, which is that they take ""intimacy shortcuts"" (my phrase, not his) in their relationship.  For instance, driving each others car's is an example of mingling two people's lives together in a way that should be reserved for marriage.  It's been a number of years since I read the book, so I don't remember all the specifics, but after reflecting on what he wrote, I agreed with his premise.  Humans have a strong desire for a close, intimate connection with a mate.  Sexual intercourse seems to be the shortest way to satisfy that need, but without first building a strong foundation of trust and a deep understanding of who you both truly are, the intimacy created by sex is just an illusion, and like a mirage in the desert, evaporates upon closer inspection.  You can add cohabitation, and other dating practices that apply the trappings of marriage to an unwed couple's relationship to the list of things that generate a false sense of intimacy.  If a couple instead fulfills their desire for intimacy with communication then they can know that they are making the right choices, whether they end up married or break off the relationship to pursue better options.  Any relationship built upon a deep understanding of the other person, and the rock-solid foundation of trust that comes with it, is most likely to make it ""until death do you part."""
TrueChristian,3dgvow,robotoverlordz,2,Fri Jul 17 21:25:57 2015 UTC,"Should I date only Christian girls?    Yes.  A thousand times yes.  And please note that ""saying"" is not the same as ""being"" a Christian.  Make sure she actually has the same views as you on sexuality, etc.  IF ANYTHING AT ALL in terms of views on sexuality, etc., is not compatible with your own view, DO NOT DATE HER.  As the great patriarch of our faith, Admiral Akbar, once said, ""IT'S A TRAP!"".    Trust me on this - I've seen enough Christians fall away because they didn't have accountability with their partner to stay pure, and decided that ""because it feels right"" is the same as ""okay with God"".  If your partner is not someone who will grow your faith, she will pull you from it - it really is that simple.  And always be ascertaining of what her true views are on God, life, etc. - having ""chemistry"" only gets you so far, and can be a weapon of the enemy, used to serve his purpose.  The ""yolking together"" is a great metaphor.  Think about it - you're not just being connected to someone.  You're being connected to serve a purpose (God's, that is)... you're sharing the load, you're pulling the same weight together.  You're not just connected by a carved log and expected to sit there - you have got to keep moving FORWARD!  This one hits close to home with me, as one of my good friends right now has basically allowed his faith to become lukewarm over a girl, who claimed she was a ""Christian"", but who is basically a liberal feminist first, and a Christian second.  Those sexuality morals?  Not important, and based on an outmoded woman-hating culture.  God's commands throughout both Testaments, and the ""raising of the bar"", so to speak (with Christ's teaching, LUST is now equivalent with adultery), that's all just oppression.   Long story short... ""TRUE CHRISTIAN"" is necessary, not just ""I prayed the prayer ten years ago, and I like to think God behaves the way I and society think he should""... or ""love is all you need"" or something.  Best places to start: Church, Campus Groups (Campus Crusade, Navigators, etc.) - ideally, any setting that allows for you to casually understand others' faith is a good place to start."
TrueChristian,3dgvow,TheFakeTomTelesco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:05:55 2015 UTC,"I'm the same age as you. Hope I can help.   At the end of last semester, my normal bible study switched to basically a course on keeping your faith in college. There was a ton of material we covered, but the main thing was having a good church community that you can become involved in, and a solid group of friends that encourage your faith.   For me, I'm not terribly worried. I have a girlfriend I could never imagine cheating on, so I'm in a different place than you.     In the Catholic Church, we have these things called spiritual directors. They're usually priests or deacons, but I've also heard of nuns and laypeople filling this role. Essentially, they meet with you often to discuss your prayer life or other things you're struggling with. You may consider asking someone in campus ministry at your school or a church nearby to fill this role for you. Someone you trust implicitly. Heck, I bet if you asked at a Catholic Church there'd be someone who would at least be willing to talk to you.

TrueChristian,3dgvow,316trees,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"Hey buddy. I'm in my later half of university and I also am waiting till marriage. Let me start by saying it is not easy being surrounded by temptation and not being able to partake. I will also say that when you find the girl of your dreams you will be so happy that you didn't give into that temptation!     Should you only date Christian girls? I want to say no but at the same time why would you date someone without the possibility of marriage and would you be able to marry a non-christian? Really think about where you want your relationship to go in the future.     When talking or dating a girl make sure she knows off the bat what your stance on sexual purity is. It will be awkward to bring up but it will make it so much easier in the future if all the cards are on the table, I speak from experience xD     So in conclusion I'd say; try to find a Christian girl if faith is a major part of your life. You have remained pure this long so don't lose that over the heat of the moment. If you feel to tempted in a situation don't feel bad about gettign up and leaving. You have control over your actions, don't give in. One day you'll meet the girl of your dreams and it will all be worth it (again I speak from experience! xD)    Cheers!"

TrueChristian,3dgvow,moby__dick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:00:54 2015 UTC,Looks like you have all the advice you need here. Just wanted to let you know I'll add you to my prayers
TrueChristian,3dgvow,wowsuchdrum,0,Fri Jul 17 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"First off - don't use a throwaway.  Your friends need to know this is a struggle you're about to endure so they can help to hold you accountable.  The accountability of an online community is thin and veiled.  If you're not willing to bring your real-life friends into your sin/temptation, it's usually because some part of you wants the freedom to sin without repercussion.  Don't let that part of you win - tell them.  Will they judge you?  It's their job to (1 Cor. 5)!  They are to do it lovingly.  But big problems will occur if you try to avoid judgment that God condones from fellow believers simply because of your own shame.  Don't let shame dominate your life.    That aside, I avoided dating during all of high school on the grounds that I wanted to focus on growing in Christ and not be distracted by temptation.  What was the result?  As soon as I went to college I started a relationship with the first pretty girl I met and the relationship wasn't a disaster.  She constantly cheated on me because I wouldn't sleep with her.  She saw me as the one she wanted to marry, but she wanted to have some fun before getting married (I know, weird).  So, I'm not confident the ""wait it out"" idea is the best.  I also suggested this to my mom once while I was in high school: ""I'll just hold off until I'm older and hormones aren't raging.""  She aptly noted: ""Unless you're willing to wait until your sixties or seventies, I wouldn't bank on that.""   Should I date only Christian girls?  Can I date non Christians?   Absolutely no dating non-Christians.  2 Cor. 6:14-7:1 is directly on point.  It does not say, ""It's a good idea not to be yoked together, but go ahead if you feel like it.""  ""Do not.""  That said, not to create a law for you, but as reliable advice - only date a girl who you already respect.  There are many ""Christian"" girls who are not necessarily respect-worthy.  If you don't respect the girl, you won't respect her chastity or boundaries ... and quite often, the non-respectable ones don't even set boundaries.  If you do find a respectable one that you can also respect, your ability to maintain those boundaries because of your care for her will heighten greatly.     I see a good way for this would be setting strict boundaries ... how do I make sure I don't break those boundaries in the heat of the moment?   Yes, but don't rely on boundaries alone.  Boundaries are a fabrication of humans that are driven by will-power.  They are only as powerful as the will-power of the people who create them.  As you become impassioned, your presently strong will-power will begin to crumble, as will the wall/boundary you set up.  The Gospel is the only answer.  Jesus didn't only save us from sin.  He enabled us to be given a new heart and a new spirit that conforms our flesh to His likeness.  Although rules taught by men will crumble, the Spirit that is in us is eternal and unbreakable.  If you invite the Spirit into your relationship and strive toward Christ-likeness, you won't even need to set boundaries because the desires of the flesh will pale in comparison to the what you are becoming.  Does that mean you won't be tempted?  Of course you'll be tempted!  Even Jesus was tempted.  But you will be able to see the clear delineation between the thing to which you are tempted and the thing you are becoming.   what should they be? How should we decide on them? No cuddling? No kissing? No being with each other alone after a certain time at night?   Ordinarily, I would say not to be physical at all.  That said, realistically, I wasn't able to maintain that boundary with my wife when we were dating, nor do I expect most men/women are able to maintain that boundary in today's culture.  So, here's a thought...   If you are going to be physical at all together, verbalize it first.  Don't just do it - say out loud what you're about to do.  Just doing things puts you in a position where you are led by wonder as to what's about to happen.  Verbalizing things somehow puts your mind in a different different state.  Instead of the passion behind the mystery, there is clear expectation and understanding, as well as a re-confirmation of boundaries.   To be clear, by ""verbalize things"" I don't mean hours ahead of time.  That would convert practical discussion into theory/hypotheticals.  If it's done in advance, you're essentially saying, ""If at some point down the line we end up in this situation, this is how we would handle it.""  If you do it on the spot immediately before you start kissing, you're saying, ""This is where we are right now, in reality, and this is what we're going to do.""  Set increasing boundaries with specific and clear time/marker tables.  By this I mean that your boundaries at first should be no physical contact at all, except maybe holding hands, side-hugs, and arm-around-her-shoulder.  Maybe after a month you decide it's okay to start doing a full-hug/embracing.  Maybe after a few more months, up-right cuddling is okay.  Maybe even longer kissing can come into the picture.   When I was dating my wife, we waited 2 years before our first kiss (I was the first person she had ever kissed), and one of our mile-markers was that we both had to be able to use the L-word before we kissed.  We also had a pre-mile-marker that we wouldn't use the L-word until we had both studied the concept biblically and had come up with a definition that we both agreed on and that our spiritual leaders approved of (for us, that was our mentors/disciplers and not necessarily a pastor).  After clarifying the road-map of when certain boundaries are allowed to be crossed, and after verbalizing that you are about to get physical in that moment, I would also stop to pray beforehand.  Pray that this time would be something that God would bless and allow the two of you to enjoy together - and ask that God would convict one or both of you if you feel the line is being pushed back in any way.  Ask that if only one of you is feeling convicted, that God empower him/her to speak up - and that if the other is not feeling so convicted, that he/she will at least respect the other's feelings and respects God enough to honor what the Holy Spirit is telling him/her.   Although this can seem ritualistic, the constant reminder - even the burden of the ritualism in it - is an aid toward purity.    But remember in the midst of all of this, you're not avoiding sin simply because sin is bad and you shouldn't do it.  You avoid sin because you love God and will do anything in your power to show that love for Him.  This has to be lived out in all areas of your life and not just this one.  What good is it if you stay pure with your girlfriend, but fail to share the Gospel?  Or what good is it if you never lust, but fail to make disciples?  If you are faithful with little, God will give you much more to be faithful with ... but if you squander what you have been given, even what you do have will be taken away from you.  In essence, if you're not pursuing God and advancement of His Kingdom outside of your relationship, then you are squandering the Gospel within you and God will allow you to fall into squandering your relationship as well."
TrueChristian,3dgvow,ruizbujc,0,Thu Jul 16 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"Should I date only Christian girls?   Why would you date anyone else? As a Christian, you shouldn't be dating to ""have a good time"" without marriage as the end goal.  Dating in college isn't bad, but if I could go back and do it differently, I personally wouldn't date until I was ready for marriage anyways (have an income and able to support a family, whether you're still in college or not).  If you already have a girlfriend, make sure that she could be a potential future wife, or there's no reason why you should still be with her. Sorry, I know that's shocking and possibly depressing, but really understand why you're dating her. If it's not for marriage, it's almost certainly for something selfish.  If you are dating someone and have the future prospect of marriage, you're going to have likely a long time before you get there so you NEED an accountability partner that is older than you at your church and your same sex! (She should get one too). You need someone that you can go to regularly and tell how well you're doing regarding staying pure with your girlfriend.  And here are the rules that I follow that keep me well away from the ""cliff"" of sexual sin:  -No lying down with each other  -No kissing/holding each other/talking about certain subjects/ANYTHING that causes sexual stimulation. You're a guy, you know exactly what this means--if you feel like what you're doing makes you want to go further, stop now. You don't know if you're meant for each other, and so you shouldn't do things as if you were. You don't share intimacy with anyone but your wife.  -Set a time where you both go home--I use 10pm as a cutoff. You both have other things you need to do anyways, especially since you're still in college.  -Again, do NOT date someone who will pressure you into sexual sin! If you are dating a Christian who does not feel remorse over pressuring you or asking you for sexual things, they are not someone you should be dating as they are not bringing you closer to God, and are thus not ready to contemplate marriage.  Good luck! I'll be praying for you."

TrueChristian,3dk9t3,drac07,2,Sun Jul 19 00:48:27 2015 UTC,"If it's against the rules then it shouldn't be downvoted, it should be reported and removed by mods (downvoted only as a temporary means to decrease visibility).  But the problem is voting is anonymous and ambiguous, anyone can declare themselves a part of the community and anyone can downvote for any reason.  Also, keep this in mind, people will downvote the way you say things, not just what you say, but you may feel like it is a backlash against your  idea or position, when in reality it's a backlash against the manner in which you stated that idea or position."

I don't down vote much of anything but if I did, that'd be why. Also, while ""not a disagree"" button is important, it's also important to understand that a huge part of the reddit population is made of lurkers who contribute only with up votes and down votes. They are sort of the silent majority that really drives the direction of this site in a lot of ways. I doubt it's hugely different in this sub vs others. There may just be a larger contingent of folks who don't comment than the average sub  (I've notice there are thousands of subscribers, yet a very regular set of posters but that's just my experience here so far)."

If that Holds only partially a tiny grain of truth...then I have a far far less radical solution for you :)  Take all your porn out to the yard, the incinerator, a fireplace, a bonfire, set a match to it. Watch it burn with a hose handy I don't want you to cause destruction of anything other than what is keeping you from loving God.  The electronic stuff you are going to have to switch off access to. No internet, no TV channels, all the other points of access porn creeps into. Still easier than actually chopping of an arm I would still wager...?  I really do not think this will work...I know how strong a grip sexual addiction holds, just as I know the nature of addiction. My real solution for you is far more permanent, far more effective. It is so elegantly and beautifully simple that you may be inclined to disbelieve me entirely...yet it is truth.  You cannot do anything to save yourself. You cannot win over your own nature even if you managed to self deny through an absolute iron will there would be a further repercussion far more sinister than the sin you managed to deny.  There is only one way out of sin and that is by coming to knowledge of and loving God. Too simple? It is but it's also a battle to be able to commit. Forget about giving up your addiction. The fact that you want to is enough. But I have to ask you. Are you ready to give up your entire self? Your life?.  Are you ready to commit to seeking God? To being his obedient child for the rest of your life no matter how long or hard or difficult the path may be? If you are feeling you can commit that much to God then commit. Like a marriage. For life. Commit yourself to seeking God in truth. Don't fret the sin, like I said we cannot change ourselves, just be willing to.   If you can make that leap of faith then all you have to do is seek him in his word. Seek truth. Ask him to guide you every shaky, faltering step. Please do not focus on your shortcomings, focus on his word, on the life giving truths, instructions and lessons that will appear clearer and clearer as you get to know him.  He is just waiting for you to commit to him, to be perfectly willing to be his so he can give you his spirit to guide you, to give you a clean heart so you can see the ugliness of sin and turn from it. It is only when we see the true nature of sin that the pleasure is entirely lost.  It is a day to day progress. Rome was not built in a day and addictions do not always disappear overnight, although, for some people they do. It all depends on how willing you are, how obedient to his law you are prepared to become. Some of us are stubborn and we throw up our own stumbling blocks that prevent our progress to perfection. Some of us only give a little and expect the world.  God does want us to become perfect. We are just not meant to become perfect by our own effort without him as our captain. It's a daily walk, open his word the moment you wake up and begin to seek him. Ask him to show you the way, ask for truth, for light. Trust him.  So. This is the commitment he wants. For life. That's what he wants. You to commit to him for life. To spend time everyday talking to him, reading his word to get to know him. Trust..even if you do not see progress at first. He will be the one who changes your heart, just be willing to go where he is leading you, impressing on your heart as you learn of his will. If you do..a miraculous thing starts to take place. Your attitude alters as your heart is being cleansed. These are his promises to us.  He will free you. We are eventually set free from sin. Satan has no hold over a willing heart earnestly given to continually seeking God. You will not be tempted more than you can endure to overcome...just expect that things take time. He will only move you when you are willing to move, only take you where you are willing to walk. It's a joint effort, so expect you have further battles to fight, but when you wear the armour of God, there is no fight you cannot win. Peace."

Last year I came back to god after trying to run away. I Litterally got on my knees and told him to do whatever he wanted with me, honestly half expected him to kill me on the spot. It sounds over dramatic but far as I'm concerned, I died that day. I don't care what happens to me. But I care when stuff is in my life that puts a wedge between me and god, such as this sin.   As far as the internet. Well, long story short, cutting out the internet isn't an option, but blocking large swaths of websites is (I do schooling online, its also what is responsible for a lot of my spiritual growth since I can research things )   My problem is I'm so tired/frustrated/in pain that in that moment all I can think about is anything to distract me. As messed up as it is, porn dulls my emotions when I bindge watch it. That apathy is some days what I crave more than anything, just so I don't have my problems bombarding me.

When I say this, my sons generally drop the subject and no longer worry about it: Dad will take care of it.  Be still and know that I am Dad!  Giving it up to God is somewhere along those lines.  OK, this is something where I can longer control the outcome.  It is in your hands, O Lord, and I am trusting you to control it in a matter that expresses His love for me.

TrueChristian,3dgaht,VerseBot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"I apologize in advance, because I'm going to make some catch-all statements about peace and worry and all that because I don't know your real life situation. I'd like to address your porn addiction, but I'll focus more on your lack of peace/joy, which I actually think is the bigger issue.  Studying Ps66:17, the Lord's prayer, and Phil4:4-7, you'll see that they all hold praise in prayer in really high regard. Right now, the dirt and mire of life is probably all you can see. But if you pray without praising, your prayers become more and more self-centered. You said it, your prayers have devolved. (Perhaps drowning Peter and blind Bartimaeus only cried ""Help!"" too, but you understand that it's unhealthier in your situation.) Cultivate thankfulness!  Obviously I'm not saying you should ignore your problems and addictions, but it's not all you can look at. Try looking past it for a while. You'll see sins you've completely forgotten about, because battling just lust has distracted you. You'll see other people, who have lives just as hard as yours and need as much prayer and loving as you do, but your difficult life has distracted you. And! You'll rediscover the gospel, the only reason why we can praise in our lowest moments. (Consider the glory of Rom8:1. You can suffer porn addiction for the rest of your life, and not even that will condemn you! Praise God!)  And according to Phil4:4-7, what happens as a result of prayer with thanksgiving? It's not that God insta-solves your problem - it's that He gives you peace. He reassures you that as bad as it gets, He still loves you and cares about you. The gospel doesn't just give us joy when we get results. It also gives us joy while we're neck-deep in sin, and I think this can be something worth reflecting on for you.  Your life is hard. But if you lose your job, your spouse cheats on you, your friends betray you, all in the same week - if God loves you, then... who cares? It's just like Rom8:35-36. What was the victory cry of the persecuted church? Was it ""God won't let you kill me!"" as they were ironically slaughtered like sheep? No, but rather ""You can't separate me from God's love!!"" That's the mindset we need!! God loves you!! That alone's enough to ease any worry, pain, or guilt. I hope you'll realize that.  ""Do not be anxious about anything."" (Yes, anything includes worrying about your lust problem. Might want to work on that!) We don't have peace because we worry. And when you worry, you want power. You want to have God's seat, because boy you'd sure do things differently right now if you were God! I've thought on more than one occassion, ""God, why did you give me these hormones?!"" As if I knew better than Him! How funny, that in my very hatred of sin, I mock God's sovereignty and wisdom!  So giving up your burden to God is the opposite. Instead of trying to bear burdens and despairing that we aren't strong enough, we accept our powerlessness and we submit ourselves to His will. ""God, I'm utterly powerless. But you are completely powerful - and completely good. So whether things go the way I want or not, I know Your decision is always the best one, and I praise You for whatever happens next."" So there's peace! It's like Rom8:28 or something (which is the same chapter as the sheep getting slaughtered, if that puts things in perspective!).  God doesn't nervously bite nails as He watches you struggle. He has a plan for your suffering, pitfalls, and failures. His sovereignty ordained these things for His kingdom and glory. And that means we can find peace and joy in Him, not just in spite of problems, but through them. Check out Ps66:8-12, 2Cor1:8-9, 2Cor12:7-10 for examples. I'd talk more but man this is a long and convoluted post. I hope at least something here was useful for you."
TrueChristian,3df3ln,jakek13,8,Wed Jul 15 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"This is a horrible article. It has a few decent point but the overal message doesn't portay the jesus of the bible. Jesus didn't just go to parties to talk to people, mostly they came to him, and he was accosted by people because he didn't shoe them away. Jesus most certainly would speak to many of the issues. The entire bible is Gods word, he isn't going to contradict it. He would tell people ""I love you, but sin no more"". He would tell them about this place with weaping and gnashing of teeth, and he would tell them about how a man who went their begged for even a drop of water.   This article paints jesus to be someone who is cool with everyone and how dare we stand up for whats right. Jesus did stand up for whats right, he trashed the temple when it was defiled, he called out the relgious leaders when they were full of themselves. but when he healed 10 lepers, and when only one came back to him what did he say? (luke 17)   17 Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? 18 Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?”   He calls them out that they didn't come back, and then he shames them. I'm not saying we need to do that all the time but we don't need to pretend its not in Gods playbook.  The truth is this article paints jesus as a a wimp, while it has some solid points individually, and I agree jesus probably WOULDN'T be welcome in most of our pulpits, I doubt its for the reasons listed here.   Jesus is not just a soft hearted man who balances children on his lap and is gentle with everyone, he is also not just the bringer of ultimate judgment and death and punishment to those who forsake him.  He is both. We don't need to forget that, he is both."

TrueChristian,3damxh,spartygw,2,Wed Jul 15 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"Good point. Thanks for the advice.   You might not even be interested, but here's where I see my blog fitting in:  I think there are two main theories of apologetics represented by the top websites. Bear with me.   Answers in Genesis seeks to defend the Christian faith through science and presuppositional apologetics. Gotquestions.org is purely a question and answer forum, if you will, using evidential apologetics and straight up explaining what the Bible says.   I see carm as a great blend of the two schools of thought. It smashes together explanations and backs it up with scripture, while providing evidential explanations. Though I'm jot sure how much the site as a whole relies on the presuppositional approach.   These sites pretty much have it covered. So I can't do much like them. I could, but they already have traffic.   I see my site as a place to help other Christians become apologists to help aid their evangelism. AIG can do this, but you have to pay for their materials.   My blog would serve to equip Christians who want to be able to defend the Faith and help them be able to do so more effectively. Like my featured blog entry states, I want to spread my wisdom to others.   Hopefully that makes sense, and I'm not sure if you were even interested in reading that, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out to someone I guess lol.   Thanks again!"

I recommend you read the commentaries on this one and encourage you to examine it in its proper context. Here is a link:  http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-6.htm  The point I am trying to make is that ignorance will be of no excuse to the condemned. God most assuredly will bring His elect to saving knowledge of the truth in His time. If that newborn is elect, God would assure salvation in His sovereignty.   If the newborn was not elect, God has every right to revoke their life whenever He should wish for the reprobate will always remain the reprobate and curse God until they are annihilated at the final judgment.  It is worthy of note that we as Christians (be it in profession or actually) do not know whom the elect or reprobate are (Only God knows) but still it is our duty through His command that we proclaim the Gospel which we do out of obedience and not expected results."

Furthermore, women who would not want to discuss their abortions/take surveys on them are the ones likely to have regrets about it.  TL;DR: Invalid sample"
TrueChristian,3d9bjf,Liquid_Boss,17,Tue Jul 14 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"No, 25%.  37.5% responded initially, but 69% of those did not continue the study.  So only 25% of the patient pool was actually used in the study.  Clear selection bias.  Not that it's the researchers' fault, it's just bad sampling."
TrueChristian,3d9bjf,cciv,15,Tue Jul 14 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"So, the full sample size is 100%.  62.5 chose not to participate.  37.5% chose to participate.  Of these...   69% backed out, which is 25.875% of the whole 31% remained, which is 11.625% of the whole   So, at the very least, we can say that 95% of 11.625% had no problems.  This means that the bare minimum of people who feel no regret is 11.04% of the sample size.  It also means that at a bare minimum, .58% do have active regrets.  Then we have to wonder how many of the remaining 88.375 would also feel no regret.  It's impossible to discern between those who chose not to participate or backed out because it was too difficult and they did experience regrets or because of scheduling or other personal issues.  So, the study has conclusively determined that if the sample size is an accurate reflection of the general population, the people who experience no regret for abortion account for anywhere from 11.04% to 99.42% of the population.  I'll tag /u/UnimatrixZeroOne in case he finds the math on this interesting, as I don't see it posted elsewhere."

Even if you take them at their word, what they're saying is like 140ish million women are ok with abortion. Nothing more than propaganda. 3) Survey's can be, and commonly are, twisted to serve an agenda. I can make any survey return the exact results I want and then also display those results in a way that furthers my agenda.  It's nothing more than lies and propaganda. Plus it also heavily depends on where you ask the questions. New york city would probably be 95ish percent. The rest of the country would drop of substantially from there, in my opinion."
TrueChristian,3d9bjf,cciv,6,Tue Jul 14 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, I don't disagree with your conclusion, but as someone working in social science research myself, let me respond to your specific points.   1) The survey was not conducted by Time; it was merely reported by Time. It was an academic study published in PLoS. The article itself can be found here: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128832#sec013 You can then evaluate the paper as it actually is rather than, as Time reports it (and I recommend that, as I agree with you that science reporting is generally quite poor)  2) First, they're not saying 140ish million are ok with abortion. They're saying 95% of those women who have had abortions do not regret their decision. That's a very different claim. Furthermore, I disagree that 670 is too small a sample. 670 with as strong of an effect as 95% agreeing would be more than sufficient to draw conclusions about the larger population if the sample was a random sample of that population. Problem is it's not (which is why I'm ultimately agreeing with your conclusion). As /u/Liquid_Boss's linked comment suggests, there was a small participation rate, and likely a response bias. We therefore cannot conclude this sample is representative of the population of all women who have had abortions.   3) I pretty much agree with you here. People can read the article and decide for themselves whether they think the questions asked were biased. I certainly think this research did indeed have an agenda.   Ultimately though, I agree with that the study is flawed. I'll need to read it more thoroughly later, but color me unconvinced for now. And finally, I don't think the study, even if accurate, are much relevant to my personal beliefs. Public opinion has little bearing on my sense of ethics."

I've been providing peer support for post abortive women since 2007, and that's just not what I've witnessed (keep in mind that I realize this is all anecdotal, and that I'm aware that I'm just sharing my personal feeling on the matter). I've just seen so many women experiencing grief and regret at first, only to be told they were ""feeling wrong"" and eventually reject/deny these feelings because they just don't want to deal with the idea that they might have made a wrong turn in life. They just dismiss their grief as post-pregnancy hormones, initial cold-feet... Especially when so many post-abortion resources have a pro-abort bend, it's hard to admit to yourself that you might be actually grieving when you're being told there can't be anything in your womb worth missing. I've seen a lot of long-term denial, and very few of these women actually get the help they need.   I'm a bit nervous about posting this, because I realize my views are controversial.

It continues to normalize the abortion process and provides a false hope of ""no regrets""… but it doesn't stop there! If you get an abortion and feel bad a about it, you are the small minority so the problem is with you. This seems really damaging to me and counter-productive to the reported agenda for the pro-choice crowd that they care about these women.

Where genuine health of the mother is concerned I think abortion should be available. Thus I have already placed the fetus in a category that is different from that of a born human, because I certainly don't think that it is OK to kill a born baby for someone's health. So I don't equate abortion to murder.  I still think abortion is wrong, and a sin, but I believe it's a Christian (and generally most other religions) wrong. I don't expect atheists and others to think it's wrong, just like I don't expect them to understand or agree with opposition to other things like gay marriage.  I have no idea whether the figure of 95% is right or wrong. I'm also not sure what bearing the figure would/should/could have on the debate either if it's correct or if it's totally incorrect and the opposite is in fact true.   Anecdotally, of the women I know that have had one, none of them regret it.

Technically all of that is a red herring. The fact is that most abortions happen around 9-10 weeks, long after there's any confusion about asking whether single cells count.   http://www.utilitarian.net/hare/by/1975----.pdf  However, if you want a note here's a paper by one of the top names in utilitarianism explaining what reasons there are to think its wrong even after conception even if you don't ascribe personhood that early.   http://faculty.polytechnic.org/gfeldmeth/45.marquis.pdf  And here's another paper that says the same thing better."
TrueChristian,3d9bjf,Celarcade,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:25:29 2015 UTC,"The morning after pill isn't an abortion pill. It prevents conception, not implantation.   Not entirely true.  While it prevents ovulation, if the ovulation has taken place, it also prevents implantation.  The pill is designed to catch eventualities.  So in certain circumstances it is preventing implantation, which causes issues depending on where you stand on the issue.    I don't think anyone gets confused about abortion and how it related to say, zygotes.  It's not a practical matter in normal reproduction.  Where it DOES become an issue is in in-vitro or non-reproductive uses.  Let's say that using these post-fertilization, pre-fetus cells is effective for stem cell farming...  That gets into the actual issues related to whether you consider it human life or not."
TrueChristian,3d9bjf,PaedragGaidin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:40:28 2015 UTC,"All of these stages are contenders, and any of them could be the ""right"" answer. The truth is, there's no way to know for sure where ""life"" begins, so there's no way to know for sure how far you can go before you're talking about a newly created person. Where there is reasonable doubt as to whether a person could be killed by your actions the most moral position is the most conservative: don't kill something you're not 100% positive isn't a human. Thus, while there's plenty of good scientific and philosophical discussion to be had about precisely where in the process a human is formed, the safest route is to avoid actively, intentionally killing the cell at any point after the sperm contacts the egg."

I personally am very disappointed that an organization that claims to be working for Christian causes would use such deceptive tactics to advance their goals.   Here's the snopes link (mobile): http://m.snopes.com/pp-baby-parts-sale/  One issue that the video brings to light that hasn't been discussed by any of these articles is the fact that Planned Parenthood seems to be deliberately converting healthy presentations of fetuses into the ""breach"" presentation, making the abortion potentially more dangerous for the woman. They do this to make it easier to access the body parts of the fetus. Does anyone know if this really does make the procedure more dangerous for the woman?"

I believed them and I thought abortion was just like contraception until I learned how development worked.   I remember being in high school and looking at pictures of developing embryos in my textbook with tears in my eyes because I realize who I had supported killing. Human lives, not potential ones.

TrueChristian,3dae7w,CantHugEveryCat,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be angry. Wrath is a mortal sin.  I don't think abortion is good, but it is sometimes the lesser of two evils. Who is going to care for and guide all the unwanted children? Will you do it? If born, these children are likely to suffer and stray away from God or never even know God. When they grow up they will probably get unwanted children of their own, and the process keeps repeating. What good will that do for anyone?  I don't know if you believe aborted fetuses go to heaven, but if you do, don't you think it would be better for everyone if they went straight to heaven without being subject to a life of suffering and risking not going to heaven?  Then, of course, there are sometimes medical reasons for abortion. To endanger a woman's life by forcing them to go through a life threatening pregnancy - especially if the fetus isn't even viable - can't be moral."
TrueChristian,3dae7w,Falsedisillusion,3,Fri Jul 17 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"Wrath =/= Righteous Anger, what breaks God's heart is what breaks mine, what makes God angry is what makes me angry.   I hardly think murder is the ""lesser of two evils"" and there is absolutely nothing you will say that will convince me otherwise. I have done the research and only a mad man would conclude it is not otherwise. The only thing I would concede is the case of the mother's life being in danger, but never viewed as a good thing, it is a termination of life granted by God.  As for the answer to your question, yes, I would care/ I do care for those children, in fact my organization does a great job at caring for those ""unwanted"" children we are expanding our services often to combat such a thing. It is the commanded duty of every Christian to take care of the poor, oppressed and unwanted, scripturally we are without excuse. The good thing is that we are expected to be stewards of life and we have been granted all the tools to do so, the precedence was set by God at creation.   The reward of heaven is no excuse for murder. This is not even worth addressing.  Your flair says Christian, but your view is not biblical and skewed towards the negative. I shouldn't ever have to argue with a Christian the merits of preserving/honoring life not with such thorough groundwork set in scripture.   I hope that you can give me some grace on my tone, my intention is to address your comment with what I believe not to hurt you in anyway, but I don't know how to not come across as angry in this, because of my job and how I interact with people who go through this process,  I am too connected to this and have seen too much destruction of innocent lives and in the lives of people that go through with abortion.   I cannot understand the reasoning behind murdering anything let alone a child, and even if it was done in ignorance, I cannot understand why someone wouldn't do research first to alternatives.

It is truly horrifying how abortion is justified by people today as if the unborn were no more than pieces of meat. Haven't we already learned what happens when certain groups of people are treated as subhuman?   Abortion is the biggest reason I can't identify as a feminist. While I'm very thankful to feminism for allowing me to have an education, a vote, and a society where I am safer walking on the street - I can't support an agenda that unwaveringly supports abortion.

TrueChristian,3d8nes,Hallopainyo,6,Tue Jul 14 11:38:55 2015 UTC,"There are 2 parts to your story, the first is whether he was lying and the second was how he handled correction.   As far as withholding the truth, study [1 Samuel 16:1-6]. There are times when people in the bible take it upon themselves to do evil and God is not involved, but in this case God tells Samuel to go anoint a new King. If anyone asks, he is to say he is providing an offering to God. He would be withholding information in this case, which God specifically commanded,which shows that withholding info is not the same as lying.   That doesn't mean we should withhold things, such as confessing your faith in God, but there is a time and place for such things. Is it appropriate for your youth leader to deceive you in this case? Was there a reason he thought people wouldn't show up? I think with a teen group he might have shown more trust, but I leave that up to you to decide.   However, I do have issue with how he reacted to correction. Proverbs says a fool scoffs but a wise man listens. Even if he disagreed with you, it sounds like his pride was hurt and he reacted wrongly by saying you offended him. From your account, you were sincere in your question.   According to the verse you cited, the next step is to bring a fellow believer in if he doesn't listen to you. But, if your view point changed and you feel comfortable talking alone with him again, consider what I've said and have a discussion with him about trusting the youth group. People may not come if he doesn't, but sometimes you need to uproot weeds in your church.   Finally, seek reconciliation and be at peace with all man as far as you're concerned. Stay strong in what is true and do not move from that. Build your house on rock in the truth, not on sand on the truth. Seek wisdom from your pastor also."

We get on really well which is the sad thing, that he'd then just think I'm attacking him. Because he's very well liked in and around the church no one ever questions him ( the youth love him!) And so whenever my parents have had major issues with some of his actions, bringing this to our pastor never made a difference because he always sided with the youth leader... Church politics"

When attempting to confront a fellow believer, be gentle.   In this case you may just have to forgive him and let it go if it doesn't seem to be a roadblock to the rest of the group right now.

TrueChristian,3d5ce4,robert9712000,2,Mon Jul 13 23:06:43 2015 UTC,Why refrain from sin? Why not just focus on Christ?
TrueChristian,3d5ce4,robert9712000,2,Mon Jul 13 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"From my experience, I see 2 types of Sin. Both are Sin, but have different roots and are looked at different by God.  The first type of Sin is one, of which was first practiced in ignorance and once you were saved and came to the understanding that it is Sin, you are aware that you are a slave too it and have no other hope but in Christ.  Romans 7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.  7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.  9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.  11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.  17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.  This is the type of Sin that you can only overcome by Christ.  The other type of Sin, is something not to take lightly. That type is when you know what the word of God says and understand that it is Sin, yet do it anyways without a care for what Gods word says about it.  It has no power over you at present, but in your own foolishness and pride you decide you want to play around with the Sin. This is not a holy attitude of humbleness, seeking for the righteousness of God, but a act of pride, desiring to do whatever you want to do.  Hebrews 10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.  28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:  29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?  30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.  31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  33 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.  35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."

I am struggling with it as well. But the bible also says that we are supposed to repent of our sins. Maybe it's just me, but I don't see how you can not worry about ""what I am doing or will do"" and still be repentant."

Revelation 3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent."
TrueChristian,3d5ce4,Zoku1,3,Mon Jul 13 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"Okay I did a lot of legwork for this but I'm only doing this to benefit the Kingdom and I pray it leads you to look for yourself further too.   2 Chronicles 7:14, Proverbs 28:13, Jonah 3:10   They are called to repentance according to the old covenant. The Lord is speaking to the Jewish people whose repentance looks very different to those under the new covenant, including but not limited to: sacrifice, fasting, covering with animal skin etc. we do not repent in these ways because the old law was fulfilled in Christ.   Matthew 5:18 “I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God’s law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.”  As we know Christ fulfilled this on the cross ""it is finished"". ‭‭  Not to say the law doesn't exist. But it only exists through the Holy Spirit who writes them on our heart BUT Hebrews 10:16-18  “This is the new covenant I will make with my people on that day, says the LORD: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.” Then he says, “I will never again remember their sins and lawless deeds.” And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices.” ‭‭   Matthew 3:2, Matthew 4:17, Mark 1:15, Luke 13:3, Acts 2:38   These are all calls to Repent and be baptized and is always followed by turn to God. Which leads us to believe he was talking to the people that were not converted yet. With the exception of Acts these were all before Christ died on the cross. So the stipulation of the old covenant was not fulfilled, but Jesus (being God) in turn told everyone to literally follow Him.    Acts 3:9, Acts 17:30   Peter is talking to people who denied Christ when he walked the Earth (Acts 3:14) therefore are unbelievers. This is also the case in Acts 17:30 when the people in Athens are making altars to the ""unknown God"" (Acts 17:23). Which would mean they did not believe in the appointed one (Acts17:31). Wherein they finally repented, became believers in Christ, and achieved salvation through Him.    Romans 6:23   The wages of sin is death. What are wages? Something you work for-like the people who work to uphold the law. But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ.   2 Peter 3:9   2 Peter 3:15 explains that he is talking about the people who have yet to achieve Salvation. Or people who have yet to repent, turn to Jesus and be baptized.    1 John 1:9   1 John1:6-7 explains that these people are guilty of lying about following God. They are still living in darkness. But ""...if we are living in the light...then we have fellowship with each other and the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses us from all sin   Revelation 2:5   Revelation 2:4 Jesus says ""You don't love me"" to the church of Ephesus. Meaning they are not believers or followers of Jesus, otherwise, they would love Him knowing what he did for them on the cross. They need to repent and turn back to Jesus.    Revelation 3:3   States that they do not believe in Christ-they are dead.    Revelation 3:19   3:20- ""I stand at the door and knock"" if Jesus and the Spirit live inside us, why is he outside of the church and knocking? -because these people are not believers either.   Please please please don't just take my word for it. Look at the context of these things. Christ only calls for unbelievers to repent, be baptized, and follow Him. No where does it call for those who believe in Christ in their heart to repent for their daily sins. If you can prove me wrong please do! I'm just learning this too but so far the test against scripture has remained successful. Let me know what you think!"

If, during a struggle, you've made your choice about a temptation or something else, and yet your mind is still in a battle over it, surrender the battle to God and stop fighting. I usually pray:  ""If it is up to me at all, I choose this. Lord, please end this battle for me. I give up.""  The Lord says we will not be tempted beyond what we can bear, right? And in the temptation there is always a way out.  And when it comes to refighting past battles, it's under the blood. If not, repent now and it is. Forgiven for all time. Once you know right from wrong and have agreed with God that what you did was wrong and you were guilty, it's over. He even said it. It Is Finished.  You may have peace now. The devil will flee from Christ's name.   Edit: thank you for writing what you did, OP."

I am deeply offended by the gay movement. They want respect yet they dare call their union ""marriage"" and they dare use the rainbow as the symbol of their perversion. They could not be any more offensive. Why should we be passive when they are actively hostile towards us? THEY are the ones going to christian bakeries, christian wedding chapels, and getting people arrested.   Changing their way of thinking is not going to be possible and we Christians are to blame for it. It all began with widespread abortion, divorces and corrupt preachers beginning in the 60s. The church lost respect, people stopped attending less and less, and now look at where we are. They are working on legalizing gay adption, polygamy, and incest. They want to add weed and other drugs instead of looking for a way to eliminate tobacco and to reduce alcohol consumption.   I think that christians got too comfortable and passive. This new struggle will weed out weak christians and strengthen the faith of thers. Unfortunately there is no turning back now. Being hostile will only make things worse. I hate it, but there is not much we can do. We could start by giving legitimacy to the church again.

TrueChristian,3d5xel,drac07,3,Tue Jul 14 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"For the first article... I mean, it shouldn't come as a surprise to a pastor that the world doesn't want to glorify God. Paul tells us not to judge those outside the church anyway. How can you hold an atheist to a standard s/he doesn't believe exists? And I'm not sure why he's only targeting NBC. He must have seen something his kids were watching? But the fact is that almost every channel on television is going to have shows that mock Christ and glorify sin. Welcome to the world, pastor.  For the second article, I don't think Christians should be deliberately antagonizing people. There's really no reason to go to an openly-gay-supporting bakery and order an anti-gay cake except to antagonize. Yeah, they do it Christian bakeries. Luckily we have that other cheek Christ told us to offer them. People in support of ""Christian values"" are calling this bakery with death threats and deliberately tanking their reviews to drive away business. Yeah, gay supporters do it to Christian bakeries. Luckily our security is in Christ and we know God will care for us, even more than he does the lilies and the sparrows. Responsibility for the the latter issues doesn't necessarily fall on the maker of the video, but the question must be asked - why did he make the video in the first place? He may not have intended the specific actions taken by others against the bakery, but he certainly wanted some kind of reaction from his viewers. I think this is a perfect demonstration of why we should avoid this sort of... initiating of hostilities. It's one thing for the world to attack the word of God and for us to respond with reason for the hope we have. It's another thing entirely to go to a place that we know hates the word of God and demand that they live according to it. Of course they won't. It only incites further hatred and is contradictory to scripture, anyway.  These are not cases of Christians ""standing up against attacks."" These are cases of Christians instigating conflict in an unloving way that is inconsistent with the Bible."

So many people already have this idea that as Christians we hate them and want to make their life miserable - referring to them as perverts, while knowing the connotations modern usage of the word createst even if we just mean the 'dictionary definition' of the word is extremely unhelpful.

[40] Then under the tunic of each one of the dead they found sacred tokens of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. And it became clear to all that this was the reason these men had fallen.  [41] So they all blessed the ways of the Lord, the righteous judge, who reveals the things that are hidden;  [42] and they turned to supplication, praying that the sin that had been committed might be wholly blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened as the result of the sin of those who had fallen.  [43] He also took up a collection, man by man, to the amount of two thousand drachmas of silver, and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a sin offering. In doing this he acted very well and honorably, taking account of the resurrection.  [44] For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.  [45] But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought.

TrueChristian,3d37j2,JustACasualUser,2,Mon Jul 13 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"Here are a few things to keep in mind:   Do not confuse emotion for the Spirit's guidance.  There are a million reasons why you might emotionally be drawn to a particular decision (i.e. to leave), but the scriptures are clear that our flesh is constantly at odds with the Spirit.  Unless you have the spiritual gift of discerning of spirits, I wouldn't make a decision based on feeling alone without more to back it up. HERE is an illustration that can help you discern God's will for your life and learn to trust in his sovereignty even when you don't have clear answers. In my experience (and I say this as a general rule and not an absolute one), God calls people to things and not away from things (except sin).  God won't call you out without giving you somewhere else to go.  So, if you have nowhere else to go, I would seek God's guidance on the next phase.  That said, if you are affirmed with great clarity that God is calling you out, then be obedient and do not delay simply because you don't know where to go."

TrueChristian,3d3ahn,ruizbujc,5,Mon Jul 13 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"One of the words the bible uses when describing homosexuality is the word we translate as ""abomination"".  That can sound like a really charged word, but what I remember from doing a study on the word it basically means ""something detestable, repulsive"".    I've had a job where I was a maintenance person in a large church, but one of the things I could never stomach doing was cleaning up vomit it would make me gag and I would ask someone who could stand it better if they could help me.  In this case it was physically/emotionally repulsive to me, but in the case of homosexuality, I believe it's spiritually repulsive to God.  He doesn't view it as simply an alternative lifestyle, it's offensive for him to think about.  I don't know that this gives you a concrete answer, but perhaps we have become spiritually numb to the revulsion of homosexuality.  If it is an abomination, revulsive to God, should it not be also to us who seek to do what pleases God?    If it were me I would have to beg off doing this kind of work for that reason.  If it cost me my job then I would take it as a sign that God has other plans for me."
TrueChristian,3d3ahn,redpandapaul,2,Mon Jul 13 10:44:33 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but the implication you take might be too bold.  For example, the Bible also calls ""haughty eyes"" (or ""arrogant eyes"") and ""a false witness who utters lies"" as an abomination.  Should a grocery clerk refuse to sell food to someone who is arrogant?  Should a contractor refuse to repair the house of an atheist because the atheist spreads lies about God?  I don't think God is saying we should stay away from abominations or refuse to love and serve them - unless that's in the scriptures somewhere and I'm just not seeing it :/ (which is why I started this post).  Separately, do the scriptures condemn a homosexual lifestyle any more than they condemn a non-Christian lifestyle - even a highly moral non-Christian lifestyle?  Clearly the act of committing homosexual fornication is a sin and an abomination, but does that extend to when a homosexual watches TV on his couch or cooks dinner?  Are these things abominations too?  If those things are not also abominations, then where do we draw the line?  How do we know what part of the line it would fall on to enable them to co-parent a child in the law's eyes when they are already doing this in their own eyes anyway?  This is where I don't have answers.  You and I are in total agreement as to the nature of their actual physical act of fornication - but I'm asking questions about what happens outside the bedroom.  Even heterosexual Christian married couples can have a sinful sex life when you mix in things like guilt, shame, anger, rage, depression, bitterness, etc.  Are we to say that this aspect of their sinfulness automatically taints every aspect of their lives such that other believers should not participate in their lives?  If they have a new child, should we not cook them meals to help?  Or mow their yard?  Etc.  To be clear, much of this is musing out loud and not intended to be rhetorical."

Should a contractor refuse to repair the house of an atheist because the atheist spreads lies about God?     This is not a good correlation because in providing legal services for adoption you are assisting them with a service that basically turns God's idea of a family on it's head.  Would you help a false witness in something that relates to them being a false witness?  Would you help someone who is arrogant in something that relates to their arrogance?  I think it's a dangerous line to engage in these things, such as in the case of when Paul talks about eating at the table of idols arousing the jealousy of God.  It is not about refusing to love and serve people, it's about refusing to support what is an abomination.  There are plenty of ways I would love and support a gay person, but being directly involved in family affairs, be it marriage or adoption I would feel is too much a statement of affirmation and approval.  I know this disproportionately affects people in professions like yours so I have compassion and think the church should provide extra support for those who might have to start making tough calls impacting their livelihood (or put them into public spotlight by their refusal).    When it comes down to it, we will all answer before God, so you need to do what you are confident in according to how you believe the Lord will receive your work on the day he returns.  If you are convinced of one thing even though I or others disagree, follow your conscience."

Would you help a false witness in something that relates to them being a false witness? Would you help someone who is arrogant in something that relates to their arrogance?   That's the question.  Where is the line?  Should a grocery clerk sell a megaphone to someone who will use it to shout blasphemies in the interests of free speech?  Or should a waiter refuse to serve food to someone who is an obvious glutton?  Most Christians would say these things are okay, but cannot distinguish why things related to gay marriage are not - they can't define that line in scriptures.  Even if the line is unclear, I haven't even seen someone propose: ""the line is at least in this region, and I know this act is on one side of that whole region, and that act is on the other side of that whole region - so regardless of where the line is, at least we know those two things for certain.""  I'm not seeing that yet.   There are plenty of ways I would love and support a gay person, but being directly involved in family affairs, be it marriage or adoption I would feel is too much a statement of affirmation and approval.   To be clear, my position with regard to affirmation/approval is not in question.  If I understand your statement correctly, though, you're saying that I can be in sin because of what someone else perceives as to my actions and intentions?  Is that correct?  I know this can be true in some contexts, specifically when this misperception causes someone else to commit an active sin (such as 1 Cor. 8), whereas it's not sinful in other contexts (such as prophets who were falsely labeled as evildoers and put into exile).

Is that correct?   While this would be a valid argument, it's not the case I was making.  When Paul is making his case to the Corinthians why they were not to eat food sacrificed to idols his main point is what you are saying, that they should not use their freedom to cause those people to stumble, but towards the end of making that point, when he gets to chapter 10 vs 14-22, he makes another point about not arousing the Lord to jealousy.  This is where my thoughts were going with that.  That by becoming servants in matters relating to what is abominable we are in some way partaking in the table of abominations and arouse the Lord's jealousy.    Notice that he starts off that section saying ""I'm am speaking to a sensible people, judge for yourself what I say"".  I'm trying to convey the same sentiment here as well.  I believe you're a sensible person.    In regard to the rest of what you said, I don't believe God gives us a tightrope we have to walk with regards to a line.  The Jews were experts at this and God called it in Isaiah ""For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little.”  but God says.

I feel like every person here (except StevenDavisPhoto, who hasn't addressed the ""already adopted by one of them"" scenario) is saying that I shouldn't do it and that it's sinful to help them do the adoption.  However, not a single person has provided scriptural backing for that claim.  Your reference to 1 Cor. 10:14-22 is the closest I have seen apart from my own internal view, which I hadn't expressed on this thread until just now (over here).  I had hoped to get other people's views first, before sharing the direction I believed God was already leading me - mainly because I didn't want affirmation or rejection of this view; rather, I wanted truth, and that's best created without any presuppositions going in.  Thanks for that last part too.  In essence, I'm getting that you're saying I shouldn't worry about drawing lines that aren't clearly drawn in scriptures, and I should instead do my best to follow God and trust that sovereignty and grace will work together for both God's good and mine regardless of whichever direction I take.

In addition to this I was getting at the idea that God's given us enormous leeway and ""wide open pastures"".  We have true freedom and we don't need to push the boundaries because we are restricted in some way.... it would almost be like sheep who have a 500 acre fenced in area, yet they are constantly asking each other ""Are we allowed to go over there"" (whether or not ""there"" is inside the fence or not is almost immaterial, they have such a huge freedom to go nearly everywhere else)."

The Muslim couple can repent and eventually make their marriage/relationship pleasing to God, but a homosexual couple are always sin, there is no way they can please the Lord unless they cease being a homosexual couple.   In this way, a child will grow up with an adverse perception of sin and repentance.   Does that make sense? Just like parents who are divorced, or liars, or theives or abusers, etc. They can always cease that activity and repent.

They can't please the Lord until they cease being a Muslim couple.   I think the difference is that homosexuality will always be wrong, and living a lifestyle as such is always going to be sin.   /u/docb30tn keeps making this same leap with no scriptural support.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how you can go from ""homosexual fornication is sinful"" to ""everything gay people do must always be viewed through the lens of the fact that they're committing gay sex.""  I agree that all non-Christians are constantly in sin all the time.  Period.  There is nothing good or God-pleasing that a non-Christian can do.  So, if a heterosexual non-Christian's lifestyle is enveloped in sin all the same, why do people single-out the lifestyle of homosexuals as being uniquely sinful because of specific acts of sinfulness that they commit in private?  Some people argue, ""Because their sin of homosexuality has an ongoing effect.  They're living together and being sinful by cooking each other meals and watching TV together and going shopping together.  It's disgusting.""  But I did all of these things with my college roommates.  It would be disgusting if I had sex with them too - but why does that sex all of a sudden change the character of the rest of their life more than any other non-Christian?  To be clear, I'm not saying it doesn't.  I'm simply saying that if you're going to make that leap, you're going to have to back it up with scripture - and nobody here has even attempted to do that yet :(   In this way, a child will grow up with an adverse perception of sin and repentance.   This is going to be true of any non-Christian couple, including heterosexual ones.   Just like parents who are divorced, or liars, or theives or abusers, etc. They can always cease that activity and repent. A homosexual ""marriage"" will always be sin unless they stop that activity.   That's why I asked the second question in my original post about whether or not a ""gay marriage"" that did not involve sex was sinful.  What if two gay dudes get married, become Christian, and then stop having sex for the rest of their lives, but remain ""married"" (in a civil union sense) because they're still close friends and are better able to parent their kids in the same household than separately.  How would this be any different from roommates receiving government benefits?  /u/AClegg1 (tagging you to get your input :) pointed out that this would be deceiving the government - and I agree with respect to those who get married never intending to have homosexual sex, and there are already statutes against fraudulent heterosexual marriage to address this specifically as an unlawful form of deceit.  But what if the initial marriage was legitimate in the eyes of the state, but they became Christians after-the-fact and wanted to keep receiving government benefits.  As far as I'm aware, there is no law saying that people who stop having sex must get divorced.  Quite the opposite, it happens quite frequently that couples (heterosexual ones especially) stop having sex for years upon years, particularly later on in life, and yet the state still views their marriage as legitimate and offers them benefits all the same - so the deceit component would be gone.  So many possibilities, so few answers!"

To be clear in the similarity you're proposing, you're comparing the occult books to their marriage certificate (in its representative capacity) - that they should do away with anything that could only exclusively be used for sinful purposes.  For property division purposes, for example (since that will come up in the divorce), you wouldn't necessarily say they need to burn their clothes and couches and bed, etc., correct?"
TrueChristian,3d3ahn,_Lucky_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:37:02 2015 UTC,Correct.
TrueChristian,3d3ahn,SnakeAColdCruiser,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:43:11 2015 UTC,"They can't please the Lord until they cease being a homosexual couple.    That's false. They can still be a couple, but not Muslim. They can convert of course, but their relationship will go from displeasing to pleasing (if you will) in God's eyes. If a homosexual couple realizes that they are in sin, they have to cease being a couple. They can't just convert and go on their merry way. So in that way, it will never be pleasing to God. I dint need scripture for that, it's reason. Romans 1, 1 Corinth 6:9 both talk about homosexuality.   There is nothing in the Bible that says two people wanting to get married have to be Christians. 1 Corinth 6:14 says not to be ""unequally yoked together with an unbeliever."" But I can't say that means marriage. I believe personally that it does, but I can't say with certainty. Thus, I can't actually biblically point to a Muslim relationship as being a sin. God never says the two parties have to be Christian.   However, God does say that the two parties have to be of opposite sex. Surely I don't need to provide biblical support for you to prove that, it is very clear app throughout scripture.   Thus, a homosexual relationship is always sin. A Muslim relationship isn't necessarily or biblically sin. Being Muslim is, just like being a thief is. But two Muslims can eventually make their marriage/relationship right, whereas a homosexual relationships can never be right. They can never be a couple and be right.   Does that make sense? Thanks for conversing respectfully with me. I'm here to learn just like you are."

But I'm asking about how to bridge the gap between ""fornication is sin"" to ""the rest of their lives together are sin also""?   Ok I can see your issue now. But lying with a man as with a woman (as Leviticus says) is not the end of it. We have to consider verses like Romans 1-- Homosexuality as a whole and not just a physical act. Lets think of homosexuality in terms of heterosexuality when when dealing with Jesus' words in Matthew 5:  ""But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.""   So the actual sin lies in the lust, no? I am heterosexual. If I so much as look at a woman with lust it becomes sin. By Jesus' own reasoning, being inherently heterosexual isn't sin at all, but using my mind and body to act on it is.   So comparing this to homosexuality, it's the same. The disposition of preferring men to women isn't the issue. It's the actions and thoughts that are the problem. So, if a homosexual lusts for their partner, it's sin.   This begs the question then, why are they in a relationship? What business does someone who struggles with homosexual thoughts (one who recognizes that homosexuality is a sin) have in starting a relationship with the same sex?   Hopefully you can see my point. It's not just sex that makes it wrong. It's the thoughts too. Homosexuality is wrong for the same reason heterosexuality can be wrong--when the thoughts and intentions are acted out (whether in the mind or in physicality).  So don't heterosexual people lust for the other? Yep. And it's wrong, as Jesus outlined for us.   Homosexuality as a mindset is wrong just as much as homosexuality as an act is wrong. I think Romans 1 explains this perfectly. Homosexuality is the result of ""suppressing the truth in unrighteousness"" and following their own lusts. Therefore, homosexuality is a sin any way you slice it. It's merely the result of suppressing the truth and not thinking the way God intended for us to think. They don't regard God as God, hence He gave them over to a ""debased"" mind.   I think, and I would go so far as to say that I know, there are no homosexual couples where their relationship does not involve some sort of sexual intention. Whereas a heterosexual couple should be looking toward the end goal of marriage, if you will. A relationship shouldn't be about lust or sex. It's preparation for marriage.   I hope that makes sense!"
TrueChristian,3d3ahn,Quellz,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"That makes perfect sense.  Thanks for clarifying and I agree with most everything you said.  The only things I would quabble with are technicalities (i.e. the ""debased mind"" is technically a step or two after God giving them over to shameful lusts, so one could argue that you can be homosexual without having yet reached the ""debased mind"" state), so props there :)  Even so, you've connected the fornication with the lust - and I completely agree with you as to that connection - but how do these connect to adoption, which is the greater purpose of my post?    Although no one has suggested this idea yet, the closest I have been able to reason in answering my own question is that God intended the family unit to be a reflection of his character - that the family unit is also made in God's image.  This would mean that there is a Father, Son, and Mother-figure (Holy Spirit) and that any incarnation of a family that violates this destroys God's image as it was intended to be displayed on the earth.  Accordingly, it would be sinful to create an additional bond that introduces a child into that broken image, thereby forcing them to take part in inaccurately reflecting the image of God, which is sin.  Of course, as noted in another thread from last Wondering Wednesday, I get the sense that most people do not agree with me that the family is meant to bear God's image and that only individual people are created to do that - and such a view is valid, so I won't stop them from holding it :)"
TrueChristian,3d3ahn,StevenDavisPhoto,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:19:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Ask a gay 'married couple' to refer themselves as 'Civil Union' now, and see thier reaction. I've had a few get quite pissed at those words. I will bet MONEY, that two married people, regardless now of preference will not have sex. Very few, will resist the urge, it's just part of who we are. If they don't stick it in each other they will find someone else or some 'thing' else to.  I got married with NO intention of ever getting divorced, however it did happen. Short story, the wife decided she no longer wanted to stay married, cheated while I was deployed on my 2nd deployment, admitted it, and I found proof. My divorce was/is legally and SPIRITUALLY legit. My man's law and God's law I am allowed to divorce her and to remarry. SHE was the one who fu**ed up, not me.  EVERYONE, screws up. No one goes about their life without doing something wrong. Some people are REALLY good at doing things well and vica versa. The 'ongoing effect' is being attracted to the same-sex. That's what people fail to see. They take the verse of 'lying with another man' as the act of sex with another man as that being the 'only wrong part' of being homosexual that is being flung around. No. God made man and woman; intended them to marry, have children, and then for the male child to leave and TAKE a WIFE.  Now, people copy/paste verses all the time and that's now how I work. ANYONE can do that. We all have free will. You can choose to believe it or not. Agree or not. Downvote, upvote, or do nothing. My life and yours will not change because of Reddit. God is much bigger than the internet. As for those intending fraudulent marriages? People do. That only devalues marriage because people LET IT. A marriage is what the two people involved make it. Say I and my future Mrs. get married. If I let the opinion of others negatively affect us OVER what what what positive people tell us/advise us than our marriage will likely suffer.  Why do you think that people who commit crimes must go to court? They don't all get the same punishment? Same goes for divorces? Even if the couple do not have children, the judge has to decide how the divorce is granted. We didn't have children (military and was gone a lot). I got my car (of course) she got hers, she got her stuff, I got mine, I got to keep all the furniture, dishes, and house stuff b/c.......she was the one who cheated. She only got to keep her car, clothes, and personal things. Had there been kids and other circumstances the divorce decree had gone differently.  When people get married and have kids the Laws give them things as well. SO many unknown variables.  Biologically, a woman can breastfeed; her breast milk (I know, TMI) has antibodies the infant gets after birth. It also gets different antibodies going through the birth canal and vagina. When a child is missing this link to the female biology/hertiage this can hamper development. I think I will leave this discussion at that. I have my views and beliefs and you have yours."

My man's law and God's law I am allowed to divorce her and to remarry. SHE was the one who fu**ed up, not me.   Although I hold that your view is one possible legitimate reading of the scriptures, I believe John Piper presents a much stronger case that remarriage after divorce (including adultery) is still illegitimate: article here.  I would also be careful of assuming any dispute is entirely the fault of one person and there there is zero mutuality in it - especially when it comes to the reaction to the sin.  Of course, this coincides with your saying that everyone screws up.   The 'ongoing effect' is being attracted to the same-sex. That's what people fail to see.   So are you saying the attraction - even in the absence of actual sex or lust - is also sinful?  How would you draw the line between when a heterosexual is attracted to a woman versus when he lusts after her?  Why is attraction okay for a heterosexual and not for a homosexual?  Where does the Bible reference attraction as sinful for homosexuals?  I'm not trying to say your views are wrong - I'm just saying you're not backing them up, so I can't trust it :/   I got to keep all the furniture, dishes, and house stuff b/c.......she was the one who cheated.

I'm not sure which states still permit ""at-fault divorce"" to affect property division.   The entire last half of your post   I have no idea what you're trying to communicate by all of this.  Like the breast milk part for example.  I'm so confused about where that came from and how it connects to this thread.  I get that homosexual men cannot breastfeed a child.  That said, they're adopting kids whose mothers aren't in the picture - otherwise the adoption couldn't happen.  So, the kid isn't going to get breast-fed anyway, so that doesn't really change anything.   I have my views and beliefs and you have yours   I'm trying to figure out what mine are on this issue.  I was hoping people like yourself would be able to share with me legitimate, scripturally-grounded reasons for their views to help me develop my own view.  Instead, I get the impression that you're more interested in ranting with emotion in an attempt to mask the fact that you don't have scriptural support - rather you believe these things on philosophical grounds and you believe that the scriptures do not contradict your view.  I can develop my own philosophies all I want.  I want to know what the scriptures say and if there is a theological basis (as opposed to a philosophical one) for believing one way or another on these issues."
TrueChristian,3d3ahn,selorn,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. :P As funny as it would be calling them ""Butt Buddies""; have a sense of humor guys. Well, then Paul and I would have a good, LONG debate with God after I die then because I have read scripture, spoke with my lawyer, and my Pastor at length.  Everyone Sins. Says so in the Bible for God says so. Who am I to say that God lies? Attraction is different between lust, unless you see no difference. Lust as being turned on, horny, wanna bang, have sex with, etc. Attraction - admire, find pretty, beautiful, desire, not in lust etc.  Divorce laws differ from state to state. I filed in my home state where we got married; she lived in her home state at the time and never showed up at court.  The last part of my post: children bond with their mothers (shown in studies and proven over hundreds of years; don't have all that data to throw at you I'm not someone to be all Steven Hawking to prove I'm a know it all) during the early years, for the most part. The antibodies help give the child a biological link to the parents that can trace possible future health concerns. SHOULD a parent, mother or father come down with something terminal or serious that the child could inherit, the parent and child can be tested, possibly saving his/her life. Since with same-sex couples this greatly reduces and even eliminates this, than medical history of one parent is all erased. One biological parent only. Like I said on an earlier post, a same-sex couple cannot give the emotional support a male/female couple can. There are many articles of where the child has expressed a life-longing desire for that missing parent: mother or father.  NEVER having a Father, NEVER having a MOTHER. Can't call a 2nd father a mother. It doesn't work; he can't explain the experience of female puberty, of female sex, of having a child, of their first female exam, etc. Same goes for two female parents: can't explain male puberty, the standards of growing up as a male teen, pressures of males in the workforce, etc. Each of the two sexes have their OWN unique experiences that one cannot experience even though writing it down or videotaping.  My best friend is gay. It's a conflict. He knows I don't support it. I don't go to clubs and stuff with him, but I don't want him to be miserable either. Not so easy, huh?"

You're presupposing that the birth parents can and will stay in the picture.  If that's the case, keep them in the picture!  Don't let the gay couple adopt against the parents' wishes.  No court in the country would force a kid to be adopted by a gay couple against the parents' wishes just because they're gay.  I don't even know why this is coming up.   Like I said on an earlier post, a same-sex couple cannot give the emotional support a male/female couple can.   Again, in the context I'm talking, there is no possibility of a male/female couple parenting this child.  The child has already been adopted by one of them.  The gay dude isn't going to go straight and marry a woman to help him parent (can he?  yes.  will he?  realistically, no).  So, any discussion on what's best for the kid is void.  I agree that a male/female co-parenting arrangement is best and ideal - no one is questioning that here.  But if option A isn't possible, what's best between options B, C, and D?

It will take me a minute to find it as its been awhile since I've researched this subject.  As far as your question about Muslim children, I don't have a good answer for you and would have to search the scriptures.  Give me a minute to find some data on the Sodomites.  Edit For Data:  [1]. According to the CDC (Center for Disease Control), the A.I.D.S. rate is 50-times higher for homosexuals..  [2] According to Bell and Weinberg study, 28% of Sodomites had 1,000 or more partners and 43% had more than 500 partners.  I did not make a typo, the numbers of 1000 and 500 are correct.  Even if you reject the Bell study (because it was a survey), you can't reject the information by the CDC which confirm the Bell study.  They are 50 times more likely to get AIDS because they can't stop fornicating.  Simply put, the Sodomites are filled with disease and all this confirms Romans 1 on how they got that way.  Edit 2:  Just as an anecdote.  There was a popular Sodomite redditor (/user/CarlH) who ran a programming subreddit (/r/carlhprogramming) who was arrested for sodomizing his adopted son.

But that isn't necessarily imputed on the kids.  The only thing that I've seen with respect to the impact on the kids is a NY Times article that promoted it and said the kids loved having two same-gendered parents and then this responsive article saying that the NY Times intentionally skewed their data and which kids they were reporting on to falsify people's perception of how kids take it.  That said, there's a difference between a kid not liking their parental arrangement and the arrangement actually being detrimental to the children.  In my job, I see innumerable situations where there are heterosexual couples where one or both parents are very detrimental to their children.  I also see countless scenarios where the kids hate one parent, even though that person is a good parent (I'm a guardian ad litem in one of those cases right now)."

TrueChristian,3d3ahn,CleatusFTW,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:01:58 2015 UTC,"unloving, abusive    You realize this is totally arbitrary right? Without a source or some sort of proof? I could just as easily apply that terminology to a homosexual couple if we're going to be arbitrary. What if a homosexual couple are foster parents?   In the end, it doesn't matter what you and I think should happen. I would much rather a child go with a loving homosexual couple over an ""unloving, abusive"" foster system any day, who wouldn't? But it doesn't matter what I think. It's irrelevant, because as Christians we must stand on God's word as the ultimate authority. God's word does not condone homosexuality in any way.   So what about parents who are liars? Or thieves? Or sinners? Or the divorced? Homosexuality is a sin just like those others right?   No. The difference is that homosexuality will always be wrong, and living a lifestyle as such is always going to be sin. Divorce is a one time thing, just like lying or stealing. A thief can repent of that sin, but a homosexual couple are always sin, there is no way they can please the Lord unless they cease being a homosexual couple.   In this way, a child will grow up with an adverse perception of sin and repentance."

If you base your moral beliefs on the bible there is no way that you would ever come to the conclusion that it is ok for a child to be raised by two gay men or two lesbian women. Show me one single verse, just one, where it says that this is good. Every where in the bible in the bible that it talks about raising children it says that you are to teach them to live under god's word, respect god, etc. It talks about children being raised by a mother and father.   If the bible specifically states that homosexuality is sinful and abhorrent to God, how can you possibly come to the conclusion that it makes god happy to have kids raised by homosexuals ? How can they possibly teach their kids to respect God, when they are living a lifestyle that is abhorrent to God, without being hypocrites ?"

I also asked God repeatedly to take me away from that life but in an instant, I fall right into it again.  Then my mother found out (with a bit of help from the Holy Spirit) and she confronted me. That was terrifying for me because the deep, dark secret I hid from everyone was brought into the light and I saw how despicable, broken, and helpless I was.  At that moment, I had resolved within myself to stop looking at pornographic materials because my addiction became stumbling block not only for me but for the people around me. It was slowly destroying my relationship with others.  Fighting off the urge to look at those images is difficult and it is a daily struggle until now. But you have to ask help from God first and foremost and dig deep within yourself to persevere to resist sin.   You have to know that you're not the only one with this struggle. You have to know that as long as we're still in this body, we will have to continue fighting sin. You may fall occasionally but don't give up. Ask God to strengthen your heart and mind. Study His word and immerse yourself in the work of God.  Will pray for you bro!"

I'm so sick of praying to God telling him it's the last time, I've gotten to the point where I feel like what's the point might as well live the rest of my life a sinner.     This is why I asked the first question. It seems that you are trying to do this on your own, for your own sake. YOU are sick of it. YOU are telling God this is the last time.    Romans 8:5: 5 Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 6 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 7 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. 8 Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God. Though verse 5 is one that would stand out here the key is verse 8. And it brings up another question for you: Do you live to please God or yourself ?     I need prayer, I need help, I'm tired of this life   I lived almost my entire life hating myself and wishing i would die, but God had other plans. God. Not me. For the past six years I tried this on my own and failed. I gave it all to Him and I know now I am free from sin and it has no place here anymore.

TrueChristian,3czq8w,insekticide,3,Tue Jul 14 08:28:20 2015 UTC,"I don't really have experience with this specific problem, but if I can tell you one thing:    I'm so sick of praying to God telling him it's the last time, I've gotten to the point where I feel like what's the point might as well live the rest of my life a sinner   You have lived and will live the rest of your life a sinner. So will I and everyone else. Even if we try our hardest to life a pious life, we are still sinners. So that is one thing you don't have to stress about, because God loves you despite the sin. It is not dependent on your actions.     An important thing you have to understand about pornography is that it works in a way like addiction. It messes with your brain in a way kind of like refined sugar. Both cola and porn give a reward on demand that is unlike it's natural form that the brain was made to deal with.   In the natural world, large amounts of sugar are rare and surrounded with fiber and vitamins, so the brain gets very happy when it receives some. Similarly in the real world, sex involves relationships, waiting for both people to want it, and the whole baby thing.   So the modern world has given us these things that produce a huge reward in the brain whenever we want it. The brain can become altered at a chemical level to where it requires this reward to function normally, and that is basically what addiction is. It can be food, porn, or opiates.   Of course, your problem is probably not as a bad as someone with meth mouth, but it is still affecting your life negatively. You need to understand that it is not just a moral flaw (which lust is, certainly) but also a physical problem. It can help you quit if you identify as someone who suffers from an addiction, if you understand the mechanism by which porn (or any other substance) alters your brain.     I think something that can also help is to find an accountability partner. You might try /r/NoFapChristians."
TrueChristian,3czq8w,of_skies_and_seas,2,Sun Jul 12 07:38:07 2015 UTC,There is some real damaging advice here. Get an accountability partner and tell your girlfriend the truth about it. You can't fight this battle alone. You need to bring in other people. Tell your pastor and ask for advice. I almost guarantee you he is equipped to handle it. He probably deals with that issue allot. Masturbation is sin according to Matthew 5:28. Take it seriously. We are to be holy just as He who called us is holy. Imagine how many blessings you are missing out on because you are not repentant in this area. I got through this and you can too. If you need an accountability partner I am available.

In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

It is done and done only by seeing the beauty of Christ. The more you pour all of your strength into fighting pornography, the more it defines you, the more it owns you, Satan has its bit in your mouth and you make yourself its slave- whether you view it, or you don't.

You can only do something else instead. Fill the time where you're bored with something productive or fun and occupy your mind. The enemy loves and empty head.   Now for the spiritual advice. Ask God to deliver you from temptation. Verbatim. this might lead to some serious inconveniences in seemingly unrelated parts of your life. But of course it will all be worth it. God doesn't want you to sin, so make sure you ask him for help. Especially when the urge starts to arise. For example, if you're sitting alone at home with your laptop near, bored with nothing else to do, say a quick prayer to God.   And finally, don't beat yourself up. Of course we should all feel shame when we sin against God, but beating yourself up just leads to self-loathing and decreased faith.

You're not one of those Christians who aren't allowed anything carnal, including food, drink, sex, sleep or even pooping, are you? So you commit the thought-crime of lust. So what? It's a victimless crime, unless you think Jesus is disgusted by your wanking and has to watch.  That being said, masturbation isn't a hobby. Perhaps you should look for a better habit to turn to when you are bored.   Pornography can be detrimental to your sexual health, and is ofttimes produced under immoral conditions. You could end up with a twisted view of sexuality. The bodily norms promoted by pornography, with exaggerated sexual attributes, aren't representative for the population in general.  If you feel you have an addiction to either pornography or masturbation, you should talk to a specialist. Start with your doctor.  All talk about ""defiling your body"", to me is just nonsense.

I believe, when Jesus said, ""But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart,"" He was referring to married women, as woman can be translated ""wife"" (it's the same word in Greek) and it's pretty impossible to commit adultery with an unmarried person, when you yourself are not married. Otherwise, if it did just refer to women in general, that would mean you shouldn't look at your own wife sexually. In addition to this, lust is not equivalent to attraction. You can lust for money, power, or women (that doesn't mean that you want to have sex with money). It's more akin to a strong and intentional desire, such as to covet.  TL;DR: Attraction is not a sin.  Furthermore, I don't recall masturbation ever being said to be a sin.  We need to keep in mind that while the Spirit guides us and convicts us of sin (which is good of Him to do), Satan tries to fill our hearts and minds with feelings of guilt, whether over current sins or past ones, to make us stray from God.

They somehow have figured out what this verse means the same way we have historically throughout the entire history of Christianity--I have no idea where you came up with that interpretation, but it's dead wrong.  Now, what you said about lust is accurate--ten points to you. But homeboy, that's exactly why you can't ""lust"" after your own wife. Your desire towards her is appropriate; that same desire towards literally any woman (or man) that you're not married to is inappropriate and sinful. Lust is feeding or indulging that desire for something that is not yours to have.  But of course, in 1 Cor 7 we see that your body belongs to your wife, and her body belongs to you--thereby making it impossible to lust after her.  Sexual attraction--thinking some girl is cute--that's not a sin.  Lust--the strong desire for what is not yours to have--is sin.

Flee from sexual immorality--do you think that refers to literally sticking your penis in a woman's vagina when one of you is married to a different person?  Is that really it? Or is Jesus trying to show us that in order to be pure sexually, we must not even have a hint of sexual immorality. Ephesians 5:3, 1 Corinthians 6:16-18, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5... in 1 Corinthians 6, Paul asks,  ""Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.  16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.  17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.  18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.  19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."" (you can use any translation you like)  ... but the best is a little later in Corinthians.  In fact, it's impossible to have a logical reading of 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 without realizing that sex must be reserved for marriage. Otherwise, how could it be a bad thing to burn with lust? You could just fulfill that lust having sex with whomever you wanted!"

I see you brought up that verse.   Flee fornication   That's an inaccurate translation. The root word is pornea, which actually is a broad term for sexual immorality, not premarital sex. check NIV, or basically anything other than King James.   burn with lust   Once again, lust is not a purely sexual term. I believe the Biblical concept of lust is akin to desire with intent, as opposed to modern translations.   You seem to be imposing current and culturally-specific definitions on non-English roots. Here is an analysis of the translation from Greek and its biblical meaning and contexts- referring to primarily sexual immorality and idolatry. It's not simply referring to sexual desire as a whole.

TrueChristian,3czkbu,tynukem7,7,Sun Jul 12 05:20:51 2015 UTC,"The best thing I can recommend after having a similar addiction is accountability. It sounds like you're going at this alone and trying to do this yourself, but this is where accountability with other believers is so important. Having someone or a group of people that you meet with on a regular basis is great, because they provide prayer, encouragement, and they can challenge you to do better. It can be really awkward at the beginning, especially if you've never done any accountability stuff, but it is really helpful. The best way to find a good accountability partner or group, I think, is to get involved in some sort of small group and look for people in there. The guys I've done accountability with have always been guys I met through my bible studies. I know how you're feeling and its incredibly tough battling tough addictions, good on you for looking for help. Also know that you're definitely not alone in this struggle. That's what kept me from seeking help for as long as I did, I felt like no one would understand and I'd be judged. But if you have solid accountability partners, judgement isn't an issue.

TrueChristian,3cxe8y,UnworthySeraph,15,Sat Jul 11 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"I spend a fair amount of time in r/DebateReligion and I think the toughest question to answer is ""if God is both good all powerful, why does evil exist?""  Most Christians will answer with something like ""evil is necessary for true free will to exist"".  I find that answer lacking for a lot of reasons.  First, evil has been around since before humanity.  Secondly, evil will not be around after Satan is cast into the lake of fire.   The best answer, I believe, is that God uses evil to bring about good.  He doesn't have to allow it at all but he chooses to for now, as he will choose not to allow it in the future.   The other thing that those who pose this question fail to consider is what happens after they die.  If all that exists is what we experience when we are alive, it would certainly be difficult to justify that it is ok some innocent child experiences great evil against them.  However, when one can admit that God is certainly capable of making up for that evil act against them somehow after this life, then the problem of evil is not really a problem anymore.  God is a just God.  Edit:  As a bonus I'll give you the #2 most common I see.  It's usually phrased something like ""how is it fair that someone who never heard of Jesus goes to hell?"", ""how is it fair that God would punish someone when he hasn't provided solid evidence?"", or ""what kind of God sends a murderer or rapist to heaven if they believe in Jesus but an atheist that dedicated their life to good to hell?""  My answer to those is similar.  The first thing is that the Bible says that God is a just and a fair God.  Those questions make the assumption that the questioner's opinion on what is fair is correct.  They won't likely accept that answer but in reality that's what it comes down to.  The creator of any software gets to set the rules, regardless of opinions of others.  Beyond that, there are ancillary arguments such as we don't really know exactly what will happen in those situations.   It seems evident that God will judge us not only on our deeds but on our hearts and how we would have reacted in other situations.  There are several passages that suggest this, but my favorite is when Jesus says it will be better for Sodom and Gomorrah on judgment day than the pharisees and says they would have repented if they saw the same miracles.  Sodom and Gomorrah did despicable acts in the sight of God and did not repent though.  That leads us to say, once again, that God is just and fair, and no Christian can definitively say what will or won't happen on judgment day beyond saying if someone is a true believer in Christ (believer in their heart, evidenced by their deeds), they will be saved.  Beyond that,  we don't know exactly."

TrueChristian,3cxe8y,ruizbujc,2,Sun Jul 12 00:28:28 2015 UTC,That makes two of us. :)
TrueChristian,3cxe8y,ruizbujc,2,Sun Jul 12 02:22:23 2015 UTC,"Just to provide an alternative take on these two ...   Q1   I usually hear this in the context of the impossible trifecta - ""good/omnipotent/all-knowing.""  The argument is that with evil, God can be two, but not all three.  (a) If he is good and omnipotent, then he must not know how to create a universe without evil; (b) if he is good and all-knowing, then he must not be powerful enough to create a world without evil; (c) if he is omnipotent and all-knowing, he must not be good enough to create a world without evil.   A1   Your answer is technically correct, but misses the reason why it's correct.  Yes, ""God uses evil to bring about good,"" but what is ""good""?  By definition, God is good, so anything he does is good, even if we, as humans, perceive it as evil.  How can this be?  Because the whole purpose of this world is to glorify God.  Anything that accomplishes this purpose is good, and anything that detracts from this purpose (if such a thing is even possible) is evil.  By using these definitions of good and evil (i.e. definitions dependent on God and not on some arbitrary standard that humanity comes up with), it becomes possible that the same actions can be either good or evil, depending on the context of God's glory.  For example, if you help an old lady across the street, is that good or evil?  Most people would say that's a good thing to do.  But what if God's grand-master plan required that old lady getting hit by a car so that her granddaughter would come to terms with the meaning of death, become saved, and then spread the Gospel to her neighbors?  Now, by doing something that frustrates God's plan, even though it good to mortal minds, we have actually done evil.  As Proverbs 14:12 says - ""There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.""   Q2.a   Let's start with: ""How is it fair that someone who never heard of Jesus goes to hell?""   A2.a   I'm not really sure how your statement is a direct answer, but I'll assume /u/UnworthySeraph comprehends what you're getting at better than I do :)  In any case, here's how I would respond.  Abraham, Moses, Elijah, Daniel, Rahab, Joshua, etc. are all people who had never heard of Jesus.  Instead, they acknowledged God and were faithful to His calling.  They also trusted that God would provide a way for their salvation, although they didn't know what it was.  In this way, their faith was credited to them as righteousness.  Those who haven't heard the name of Jesus today are still under the same rule, as Romans 4:23-24 says: ""The words 'it was credited to him' were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness - for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.""  In this way, one who is without knowledge of Christ only needs to acknowledge their sinfulness (1 John 1:8), and that their sin warrants death/spiritual punishment (Romans 6:23), that God exists and rewards those who earnestly seek him (Hebrews 11:6), and that this reward is a reconciled relationship with God (Romans 5:10).  They probably don't even need that last part.  To address two frequent objections:   But how are they to know about God to begin with if no one tells them?   The simplest answer is the fact that virtually every single tribe believes in some form of a deity.  It would be much more difficult for an atheist to answer the question in reverse: how could you get them to believe there is no god if no one tells them?  It's inherently written on their hearts by nature (Ecclesiastes 3:11).  That's not to say there are no atheist tribes, but they're greatly in the minority.  So, if we're to understand that most of them inherently believe in a deity, and we know that God has also written the requirements of the law on people's hearts (Romans 2:15), it's not hard to surmise that they will be able to know they've done something wrong in their life and how to pursue God in trust for his salvation.   Even if they do believe in God, how can they know how to follow Him without the Bible?   I already hit on this: Romans 2:15 says that the righteous requirements of the law are written on our hearts, specifically addressing ""Gentilese who do not have the Law ... are a law to themselves,"" and that ""their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.""  In essence, everyone inherently knows right from wrong.  This is built into our spirits since the time Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  That knowledge is passed down to us, including those who have never heard.  So, we don't need the scriptures to tell us we're imperfect.  Even atheists who reject the scriptures will acknowledge their own imperfection.   Q2.b   To restate the question you posed: how is it fair that God would punish someone when he hasn't provided solid evidence?""   A2.b   You hit the nail on the head: they're missing the point of ""fair.""  Ultimate fairness (as opposed to mortal fairness) is that God created us for a purpose and that he should expect us to live out that purpose.  If God doesn't get out of us what he created us for, that's unfair to Him.  The term ""fair"" implies that the person desiring ""fair treatment"" deserves such treatment.  As humans, we deserve nothing but death.  God deserves glory, honor and praise.  It is unfair that God does not get what he deserves.  It is, however, fair that we get what we deserve.  But how is it 'just' that God would condemn us to hell just to make himself feel good?  That seems pretty evil to me.  Atheists will say this, as if they are the authority on good and evil.  Was Shakespeare evil for writing Titus Andronicus - a story in which a national hero has his sons die at war, his daughter raped and made into quadriplegics with her tongue cut out, and then he ultimately is also killed?  Shakespeare created a story - a universe of his own design - in which all kinds of tragedy happens.  And Shakespeare was glorified for it, among many other tragedies he wrote, which added to his glory as a writer.  But his characters are just stories - they're not real.  They're not sentient.  We are, and there are eternal consequences.  This presupposes that God is on the same level as we are.  God's concept of sentience and thought process are so much greater than ours that what we value as sentience, he sees as infinitesimally insignificant.  The real obscurity isn't the ""injustice"" or ""unfairness"" in his actions, but in the fact that he should have any value for our existence at all.  It would be truly bizarre if Shakespeare were to fall in love with one of his characters and write himself into the story just so that he could be with her.  He's an author.  He's above that.  But God chose not to be.  Again, you had some great thoughts, but this is just some more food for thought to process, as most atheists I've spoken with (if given a few hours of conversation) ultimately have trouble responding to these thoughts.    On a separate note, for /u/UnworthySeraph, I'll comment that the hardest question I have ever dealt with from atheists is: How can you expect me to believe something on faith that cannot be proven - especially your God over someone else's, even if I were to believe in a god.  The problem here is that they're right - God cannot be proven.  We can prove countless parts of the Bible as true, but we can never prove that Jesus is God.  At best, we can rely (on faith) that because many parts are true, there's an inherent reliability in the rest as well - but that ""rest"" is not provable.  I can also demonstrate the inherent reliability of Christianity as compared to other religions, but there's still no evidence that they are willing to accept that I'm right.  Even so, many judges look at the same case, same evidence, and yet come to two different conclusions.  Ultimately, this question is one that only the Holy Spirit can answer for them.  So, don't get bogged down with questions that are impossible to answer, trying to explain something that can't be explained.  Acknowledge where the Spirit must do his job and let Him do it - don't think the burden is entirely on you - if at all :)"

TrueChristian,3cxe8y,EaglesFanInPhx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""judges"" example is based on personal experience.  I'm attorney and it's super frustrating that I can win some cases with one judge, but with another I would lose, despite the exact same facts and evidence being presented.  The lack of any real standard and the arbitrary nature of the judicial system has always been of great interest to me when I see atheists who support the judicial system as a champion of justice in our world, and yet fail to recognize the absolute lack of any real authoritative value in it.  Instead, they harp on Christians for their failure to look at the evidence, when we do see that same evidence - and more - and yet come to a different conclusion.  To throw it one step further, there are many judges who will allow character witnesses and eye witnesses drone on for days at trial because the more people who share a common understanding of a circumstance adds to the reliability, and therefore is admissible.  Other judges would throw it out and say, ""I only trust documents and recordings and tangible evidence, etc."" on the basis that human testimony is unreliable because our memories are quickly faded, our perceptions are easily clouded, and our character for truthfulness is often called into question.  Christians have no problem with trusting people - and most every judge permits this kind of testimony, even if they don't like it, because personal experiences are evidence.  Atheists reject personal testimony as evidence because there is too much potential for conflict (he said/she said scenarios), and thus they're very limited in what they're looking at with which to make a decision.  It's no wonder they say there's not enough evidence for God when they're missing the evidentiary testimony of those who are willing to share their testimony."

TrueChristian,3cxe8y,ruizbujc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by your last paragraph.  While there are ambiguous cases, the doctrine of Christianity is clear on what happens to non-believers.  Yes, we can't know for sure about the fate of an individual soul because only God can see the heart, it is clear what the Bible says about the fate of those who reject God.  This is why the problem of evil in a tough one.  Given ambiguous cases, our heart burns at the fate of those who seem good on the outside and we cannot understand why they should be punished forever in hell... yet the Bible is clear.  The cut off is faith in Jesus - and no matter how ""Mr Rodgers-like"" a person may be, if they don't believe in Jesus, they die.  I think this is what upsets most Christians, they feel it's unfair and try to rationalize how it can be good.  So, like you, they say things such as 'heaven will be so good that it will make up for all the pain and evil suffered in this life.'  And, perhaps, like the pain of childbirth being made up by the euphoria of holding your baby.  But, this is only the case for those who are saved.  What of the idol worshipper in Africa who dies from a bot-fly infection at the age of 19, who only knew poverty and strife only to go to hell because he did not meet God's standard in the Final Judgment?  This is where the problem of evil has no answer.  While pain and suffering can be made up to those who live in paradise, it cannot be rationalized in the life of this poor hell-bound soul and thus, some think God inflicts pain and suffering simply because he can.  Perhaps just so that he can show his goodness to a small subset of humans who pass the test.  Despite all this, Christians are encouraged to read those passages which state God as being a fair and just God, putting your faith in his goodness... and try to ignore these tough moral questions."

I agree with this statement.  I was saying for those that may have a case for ignorance.  Jesus talks about the blind not being responsible for sin.  One that rejects God has made their choice.    yet the Bible is clear. The cut off is faith in Jesus - and no matter how ""Mr Rodgers-like"" a person may be, if they don't believe in Jesus, they die.   I disagree here.  This is what I have been taught growing up but there are so many passages that allow for other possibilities.

So, like you, they say things such as 'heaven will be so good that it will make up for all the pain and evil suffered in this life.'   My point was not just about heaven and hell.  It was about judgment.  It is quite clear from the Bible there will be those with better and worse (or no) rewards and differing degrees of punishment.  My point is simply that without understanding the exact mechanism that God judges, I can fully believe that an atheist that dedicates his life to good works will be judged fairly.  That may mean no heaven but little to no punishment or it may mean something else.  My point was just that - we don't know!  The antagonist position says that a ""good"" atheist enduring eternal suffering isn't fair.  The argument against it is either their definition of fair is wrong or the certainty and quantity of their punishment is less certain.   What of the idol worshipper in Africa who dies from a bot-fly infection at the age of 19, who only knew poverty and strife only to go to hell because he did not meet God's standard in the Final Judgment?    Once again, the Bible says in many cases we are responsible for what we are aware of.  It also seems to indicate we are judged on our hearts and how we may have reacted in a situation we didn't encounter in this life.  We don't know exactly how he would be judged so for any Christian or atheist to make a definitive statement about evil or fairness is rather assumptive.   Despite all this, Christians are encouraged to read those passages which state God as being a fair and just God, putting your faith in his goodness... and try to ignore these tough moral questions.   I frequent r/debateReligion so I make sure not to just ignore the tough moral questions.  Maybe some people don't care, but for me those questions need to be reconcilable with my faith."

In fact, Paul reaffirms this in the following passages:   Romans 2:12 - ""All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.""  Here, Paul is essentially saying that we will all be judged by the standard we have available.  Even those who have not been given the law will still be judged and perish without Christ. Romans 2:15 - ""They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.""  This demonstrates that we will all be judged by our conscience. Genesis 3:6-7 - ""When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.  She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.  Then the eyes of both of them were opened.""  They were blind to right and wrong before, and thus death and judgment did not reign in them at that time.  After this sin, they gained sight, which is passed down to all  of us. Romans 5:12 - ""Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.""  This affirms that Adam's knowledge of good and evil was spread to everyone, and thus no one is blind as to good and evil anymore. Romans 1:20 - ""For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.""  This seals the answer.  God's character and expectations are ""clearly seen,"" meaning that no one is blind any more, and thus we are all subject to judgment by the terms of the revelation God has given us - and this revelation is always sufficient to understand enough to warrant condemnation and even salvation (see Romans 2:15 again).    It's much less clear on the rest.   Per the above, I don't see where there is still a lack of clarity.  The only one that seems up for grabs is intellectual infants (i.e. babies or mentally handicapped adults).  Even then, I believe there are answers in scriptures.   It is quite clear from the Bible there will be those with better and worse (or no) rewards and differing degrees of punishment ... That may mean no heaven but little to no punishment or it may mean something else.   Although I greatly disagree with this view, I acknowledge that the scriptures can be read consistently with this view by forcing it on the text.   The argument against it is either their definition of fair is wrong or the certainty and quantity of their punishment is less certain.   This is correct - and the first part is the proper answer.   It also seems to indicate we are judged on our hearts and how we may have reacted in a situation we didn't encounter in this life.   Curiosity has the better of me ... where are you getting this from?  I'm not denying it's there, I just don't recall any passages like this off the top of my head.   for me those questions need to be reconcilable with my faith   This is true only because God has stated that he does not change and will note lie (Numbers 23:19).  Assuming he is telling the truth in this statement (which requires faith), we must be able to reconcile everything to God's definitions and standards, but we should never expect to reconcile them to our own.  I cannot create my own version/understanding of morality and say, ""God, if I can't reconcile your actions to this standard, then I'm not going to believe in you or follow you.""  God hasn't promised to meet our standards - he only promises to meet his own.  Back to the first sentence here, if God (still having undeniable authority and power over us) decided that he was allowed to change his view of morality at a whim, then there would be no sense in reconciling morality to God at all, for it might change again before we're able to figure out the first one - and thank goodness this isn't the case!"
TrueChristian,3cxe8y,apophis-pegasus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.   I really enjoy reading through and learning.  For the first point about blindness, I agree completely with what you say.  The judgment will be based on whatever God made available to them.     Per the above, I don't see where there is still a lack of clarity. The only one that seems up for grabs is intellectual infants (i.e. babies or mentally handicapped adults).

Although I greatly disagree with this view, I acknowledge that the scriptures can be read consistently with this view by forcing it on the text.   I really appreciate your insight.  What view do you hold, and why?  I'm familiar with the verse that we lay our crowns at his feet, but not sure of anything beyond that that suggests equal rewards or punishments.     Curiosity has the better of me ... where are you getting this from? I'm not denying it's there, I just don't recall any passages like this off the top of my head.   A couple passages lead me to think this is a possibility (but it's not a strongly held belief by me).  Matthew 11:23-24 is one.  http://bible.com/111/mat.11.23-24.niv And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.  For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.  But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”   This is true only because God has stated that he does not change and will note lie (Numbers 23:19).

TrueChristian,3cxe8y,OffWhiteDonkus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"Differing rewards in heaven  The concept of rewards or greater punishment presupposes we can earn something by being really good or really bad.  But the Bible is clear that we are sinful by nature and that in the absence of God's intervention in our lives, everything we do is sinful.  So, every good thing we do is something God has done through us and not necessarily something we have done.  Accordingly, God is the one who receives the glory and rewards for our good works, not us.  This is why, as you reference, the elders set the example of laying the crowns of glory (representative of those things that we have done in life that are good and glorious) at Jesus feet - because they were really his all along.  Ephesians 2:8-9 is also indirectly on point.  Although Paul is talking about salvation, he demonstrates that a presupposition that we can earn anything by our works leads to boasting, which is not godly (unless we boast in that we understand and know God, per Jeremiah 9:23-24).  So, a presupposition that we can earn different rewards in heaven and thereby have a higher status than someone else would be us trying to take credit for something that God did and would almost assuredly lead to arrogance and boasting.  Some will point to the parable of the minas (Luke 19:11-27) as evidence against this.  I'll refer you to this post, where I go into greater detail about this issue and also the context of the parable of the minas.  Romans 2:7 also says, ""To those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.""  There is one gift for all.  Some will also reference 1 Corinthians 3:14 as evidence of rewards in heaven.  That said, this doesn't imply different rewards - it just says rewards.  Also, if you look at the greater context (v. 5-15), you'll see Paul is really talking about identity and just how much of you will make it into heaven (see my short summary here).  Differing punishments in hell  My conviction here isn't anywhere near as strong, and I'm even close to shifting my view.  That said, I am inherently skeptical of any doctrine that is only rooted in one passage (see below).  The first thing that needs to be addressed is: what is hell?   Some people believe it doesn't exist - God just wipes them from existence (i.e. annihilationism). Others believe hell is a physical place of flames where people will be in constant turmoil and never die.  This is certainly a strong possibility.  However, Jesus is known for using parables with physical imagery to communicate a spiritual truth.  So, it's possible he meant something else (I'm not saying for sure). Another category believes that hell is a physical place (some even would say it is this earth) where people will be able to live out their lives in the complete absence of God's manifest presence, grace, and mercy.  In essence, they believe God says that the just thing to do would be to give them exactly what they want - they rejected Him in this world, so they will get a world and eternal life without Him.  Those who believe it is this earth where they will remain would argue that it's fairly reasonable to assume that a world without grace and mercy would end up with ruined cities, forests, etc. that are set on fire, thus giving credence to some degree of literalism in what they would otherwise say is predominantly imagery.  (See also Matthew 7:23 for an ""out of God's presence"" passage)   Between the second and the third, I am uncertain, as I see validity in both.  That said, it seems more consistent with God's character to understand heaven and hell as being distinguished by the absence or presence of God's manifest presence, grace, and mercy.  Specifically, although I do believe heaven will be immensely blissful, I don't think it is defined by some constant spiritual orgasmic feeling from some sort of pollen in the air or something (i.e. opposite of flames?) - rather, the bliss is because we are in a right relationship with God in the manner He always intended.  It would then follow that the torment experienced by those in hell would be because of the absence of any relationship with God in the manner they always intended, rather than fire being the source of the torment, which is just imagery for what the feeling will be like.  This is the way I lean - but just because I lean on one leg doesn't mean I've lopped off the other.  Passages I reject as evidence  Although I reject these passages as clear evidence, if the theory of ""levels of hell"" is theologically correct, I do acknowledge that these passages would almost certainly fall in with such a theology.  I just don't see that they have to.   ""Judged according to what they have done"" passages could easily reference a general allocation between the gift or the penalty.  Romans 2:6-11 uses this terminology and yet seems to say simply that they will all get ""wrath and fury.""  There's no reason to believe that they will all receive different ""wrath and fury"" from different degrees of works in any such passages.  So, this is a strained implication. I also don't accept the implication of Matthew 10:15 and 11:24.  I can easily see this as being a culture-shock issue.  S&G were already prone to rape, murder, etc.  If hell is what I suspect, it will simply be a more extreme version of what they were already living like, only worse and for eternity.  The cultures Jesus is talking about are ones who had a much clearer revelation from God (i.e. because of Jesus' presence on the earth).  Because they lived generally moral lives, they thought they didn't need God - but they didn't understand the full implications of a life of Godlessness.  They're not used to rape and murder as a fundamental part of their society.  So, they will have a greater shock when introduced to the environment of hell.   Possible evidence  The one passage that is much clearer on this point is Luke 12:35-48.  The context is difficult to ascertain.  The passages before it address both earthly needs/expectations and heavenly rewards.  So, it's hard to tell if the ""treasures in heaven"" part is an aside and then Jesus returns to talking about how we should live our lives on earth or if it is a transition.  The passage after seems to imply he's talking about earthly punishment.  Specifically, he tells this parable about a servant getting beaten and then immediately after says, ""Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth?  No, I tell you, but rather division.""  So, I get the impression that he's talking about earth.  That leads to a few possible interpretations:   It could be ""levels of hell,"" as many believe. It could be that he is referencing the differing life situations of those who are alive during the tribulation, when God takes over and shifts gears again - on this earth. It could be that, as with the parable of the minas, he is referencing the church as ""his household"" that the servant is protecting and keeping.   (a) Major evidence for this thought process is that it says the unfaithful servant will be put with the unfaithful.  If he is already unfaithful, why does he need to be put somewhere else?  It seems that Jesus is talking about someone who was in a position of the faithful, but it is later revealed that he is not true to that position.  (b) It is also striking that only one of the four servants is killed, which would imply ""hell"" more directly to me.  If a ""beating"" is hell, then what is ""cut into pieces"" (i.e. death)?  How can you die in hell?  It's just an odd concept.  (c) The master's going and returning would be much like the parable of the minas, where the master tests you with a little and for a while to see if you can be faithful with much, and thus God will set the servant ""over all his possessions"" (the church).  (d) But when the servant becomes faithless because he doesn't experience God's presence and starts to doubt and carry on by his own methods and ways what he had once begun in the Spirit (Galatians 3:3), then when God's presence returns to him, he will be convicted by the Spirit.   For some, this will mean a crumbling of their faith and they will abandon the church and all godliness (i.e. ""cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful"").  These are the false prophets described in Matthew 7:22-23, who will ultimately be deemed unfaithful and be cast out of Jesus' presence (i.e. hell, per 7:23). For others, they will experience severe grief and self-loathing over their time of rejection for God, but they will remain faithful in their duty afterward because of the corrective punishment For those who lacked knowledge of how God wanted them to care for his people, the conviction of the Spirit will not be as devastating; rather, they will see their fault, acknowledge their sin, and then move on.   (e) Remember that the purpose of a master's beating is corrective action and is not synonymous with the first person who is literally killed, which has no corrective intentions.  (f)  All of this is affirmed once more by the same phrasing being used here as in the parable of the minas: ""Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.""  As with the minas, this doesn't seem to be about the punishment, but the ongoing expectations of those who have been faithless for a time.  I can't reconcile this last sentence with a view that this passage is about levels of hell.  In any case, I'm torn between all of these options, but for the reasons above, I'm inclined toward the third view - that this is about our obligations in this world and not about what will happen afterward.  Of course, I openly admit that I could be wrong and misguided."
TrueChristian,3cxe8y,apophis-pegasus,2,Tue Jul 14 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"Per OP's (/u/UnworthySeraph) request, I'm responding to this post.  I will reply to /u/EaglesFanInPhx's reply to this as well, as it's hard to separate your post and his.    The big thing I see that you're missing here is exactly what /u/EaglesFanInPhx tried to point out - you're confusing man-made standards with God-made standards and assuming that the man-made standard is absolute.  Specifically, morality is a fabrication of conscious beings.  There is no ""absolute law of morality.""  Many Christians are flat wrong when they say there is such a thing as ""absolute morals.""  Somehow atheists will get this concept, but then be double-minded by trying to judge God by their own moral standard, as if it would apply to Him.  To be clear, judgment works from the top down.  Kings judge peasants.  Judges judge alleged criminals.  Parents judge children.  There is no higher standard than God to judge him by.  It's not like there is some absolute standard that predates or supersedes God.  God created morality.  He imparted that in us when He made us in His image.  In eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, Adam and Eve began to understand that Satan had a different, lesser morality and that he had duped them into violating God's morality, and thus they lost their ability to discern what was from God versus from themselves - and we are now all cursed with the same confusion.  If there is a higher standard than God, how would we know it?  There is no super-divine revelation from this higher standard.  You could argue that it's inherently understood by our own conscience, but God is the one who created us and gave us his conscience, so we can never argue that any moral standard we use is higher than God's.  So, without any form of revelation as to this higher standard, we have no option but to accept the fact that either our morality is limited by human thinking capacity or it is a shadow of something ideal that God imparted to us.  So, Christians don't ignore these ""tough moral questions.""  Rather, we simply understand morality to be what God decides it is.  His purposes are often beyond our initial ability to comprehend a situation because we don't have infinite knowledge.  I once heard someone comment, ""God's will is what we would do if we knew everything he knew, and loved the way he loves.""  I reference examples of this in A.1 of my post here (specifically, the ""help an old lady across the street"" example).  To be fair, I can create my own moral standard, and that standard is legitimate as to my own authority and power.  For example, I can impose my standard on my children - and if they violate my moral standard, I have the ability to punish them as my moral standard sees fit.  However, if my moral standard includes killing my children for telling a lie, and I am on trial for following through with this, I cannot argue before the judge, ""Your honor, I was acting in a completely moral and appropriate manner.""  The judge would say, ""By your standard, that may be, but I'm the one with the ability to enforce my standard over yours, so you're going to jail.""  My moral standard is inferior to the judge's (or, rather, the legislature's) because I have less ability to enforce my standard and carry out the consequences for violating it.  I would say it's not fair.  I was only doing what was right.  I was purging evil from my home and demonstrating to my other children that they should not commit evil either.  That doesn't matter - I'm wrong in the eyes of the law.  Now, God is the most powerful being in all of existence.  His authority is higher than any human authority.  So, whether or not he agrees with your moral standard doesn't affect how he will judge you or me.  He will always judge by his own standard.  Fortunately for us, his morality includes telling us what his standard is, as well as an affirmation that we can never live up to it, and that he has another plan for us to be deemed to have met that standard, even though we fail.  This is the core of grace because God did not have to tell us what his standard is.  Even in the midst of Jesus' death and resurrection, he could have prevented the scriptures from being written, or simply not inspired people to write them at all - and then we would all be doomed.  Even so, if God says, ""By my moral standard, that's fair,"" we have no room to object, because he has power to enforce his standard and those of us who claim it is unfair have no authority to enforce our view of fairness.  Indeed, which definition do you think God will use to judge us - his or ours?  Accordingly, any attempt to judge God's moral character must first meet the daunting task of proving that their version of morality is higher and superior to God.  I have yet to meet someone who has been able to do this, let alone in the context of a presupposition that the God of the Bible is real and everything in the Bible is also true.  To be clear what I mean by that, in order to judge the God of the Bible by a moral standard, you have to presuppose that the entire Bible is true.  If you pick apart individual sections and say, ""See, God is immoral because he ordered women and children to be killed,"" and yet leave out any other scriptural basis for understanding God and His motives, then you aren't condemning the God of the Bible - you are condemning the actions of an incompletely defined god who may or may not be consistent with the God of the Bible.  Someone (not necessarily you, but I'm nipping a common response in the bud) will say, ""That's all well and good, but I'm not going to believe in a God who kills babies.""  To such people I affirm that they don't have to.  However, I will also affirm two things: (1) believing and following are two different things; if you choose not to follow him because you think your moral standard is better for your life and belief system, that's your own business; but you still need to come up with a separate basis for choosing not to believe, as most atheists do; and (2) asserting this statement is akin to an acceptance that you would rather spend an eternity in hell than admit that you might not be right about what you think about good and evil.  This is the height of pride.    Sorry, I meant to address a lot more in your post, but I ran out of room/time and thought all of that was more important, as it gets to the heart of what you're talking about rather than addressing specific phrases."

That's a very good way to see that there really is something bigger going on. No mere man can make those predictions as accurately as the Bible did.

The probability is 1 out of 256, which is really low.  But. How many other octopi or dogs or whatever were also out there making incorrect predictions?

Yet still people turned away again and again, and continue to in the present day... That fact that we are so flawed and selfish is why people turn away.   We (atheists) genuinely don't believe that G-d exists. It's not like when another person talks to you and you willfully ignore them. It's more like how you're all not members of the Church of Scientology because you think that Scientology was made up by people. Likewise, I think that the idea of G-d was made up by people. I don't ignore the Christian Bible because I'm selfish or flawed - I ignore it because I don't think there's a supernatural being behind it at all."

B) If I or anyone else experienced G-d directly (by seeing, hearing, etc) in a way that was distinguishable from psychosis.

B) I believe that God has stopped speaking to people in this special way. No more prophets (Luke 16:16). On another note, there is reason to believe that the Bible was not written by a bunch of people suffering psychosis because of its internal consistency and fulfillment of prophecy.

Another point: as human beings we are incredibly good at deceiving ourselves, rationalizing things that would be wrong for other people when it's in our best interest. So be careful with your reliance on your mind and your conclusions. Always take them with a grain of salt if possible.  If you don't mind, I have a couple of questions. What do you think of Jesus? Who is he? Have you read the gospels? Did he get crucified and get ressurrected?  How much do you know about DNA and the process of replication, transcription and translation into amino acids?

I've read parts of the gospels (working on the rest - someone very important to me is a Christian, and I wanna understand her beliefs), and to me it sounds like a part-true story that was embellished through many tellings and retellings, translations, and intentional distortions. There are lots of fantastical stories out there - why believe this one? For something as extraordinary and unique as resurrection, I'd need more evidence than a long game of telephone that's been going on for two-thousand years through multiple languages.   proof that life (and probably the cell) was designed by an intelligent being   The universe is amazing and beautiful and complex, but that's not proof of a watchmaker. Amazing and complex things happen when you have lots of interacting parts and enough time to let things unfold. Are you familiar with the Mandelbrot Set?

For instance, if an employee tells his boss that he'll miss work due to a death in the family, the boss may not believe the excuse if he's has had disciplinary issues with this employee in the past (or for whatever reason). He may want to believe it is true and may even act upon an assumption that the employee is telling the truth. That want and action, however, doesn't change his belief that the employee has lied.    In a similar way, I wonder if, for some, the amount of evidence that has been placed upon ""a knife's edge"" isn't enough to convince them of God's existence. I wonder if they have a choice in believing it or not. One may believe it's true but choose to not act upon that belief and ignore God.

(Footnote: I know that different strokes are for different folks and all that, but I absolutely love Hebrews and it was the most influential book in the Bible for turning me toward my faith as a teenager. I use this book as an example whenever I can, especially in conversation with nonbelievers, because it helped me when I was a nonbeliever.)  In summary, Hebrews 11 lists a number of people who were saved and blessed by GOD before Jesus came to Earth. Like you said, even in the beginning, even for people who have never heard of Jesus, they have the opportunity for salvation. For these people, their salvation came through faith in The LORD and the only knowledge that they had of GOD before. Then He graciously gave us more reasons to believe when we met Jesus in the flesh.  P.S. I think it's fantastic what you're wanting to do.

You have a very interesting perspective.    Correct me if I'm wrong but what I am understanding from you is that:     A ""false choice"" means that because you have a limited number of choices to choose from, and you choose one of those choices, then you are not actually choosing.        If that definition is correct then I just don't see how that can logically work out. If you can help me to see how a ""false choice"" is logically sound that would be great.     To answer your murderers question:     I do not believe that making a free choice and picking from imposed choices, are mutually exclusive. You can still choose any of those two choices freely even though they are imposed. Yet, because of the way that God has made this world, you could choose to fight, run, or to stay still. Regardless of the number of choice that exist, you still have the free will to choose.     If I have a child and I give him 3 different object to choose from, he is free to choose any of the object, and even free to choose no object. Even if I forced him to choose an object he could still decline. He would still have free will to choose regardless of the consequences.   That's the way I see it. By the way, are you Christian?"

All the stories in the bible (and the Quran and Torah for that matter) happen in a very small geographic area. Why did God never speak to the Native Americans or the Aboriginees or the Ancient Chinese or anybody not in the Mediterrean/Middle East?   And also the crucifixation/resurrection of Jesus was no doubt a very important event in terms of God's plan for us (obviously). There can be denying that news of this act travelled very slowly. During the European's Age of Exploration they were still spreading this news/story, and that's over 1500 years later.   Those are the types of questions I get a lot, and tbh they are the ones I have the hardest time answering - (I haven't figured out answers to the two examples I gave yet tbh).

People have a stereotype in mind where all Christians are judgmental, hypocritical blowhards.  The easiest way to change this perception, I believe, is to not be like that.  If we actually love Jesus, we'll love other people too, and it only takes a little bit of self-awareness to notice if we're being awful or un-christlike."
TrueChristian,3cxe8y,segfault0x001,5,Sat Jul 11 22:02:24 2015 UTC,"I'm an atheist; my principal objections to belief are as follows:  1.) Where's the evidence?  Sure, Jesus likely existed, that's not the issue.  The issue is the evidence for the supernatural claims of Jesus as opposed to all the other supernatural claims from all the other religions which both of us know are nonsense.  Did you know that Mohammed supposedly split the moon into pieces in front of a group of witnesses in order to demonstrate the power of Allah?  He didn't, of course, it's make-believe.  But Muslims believe it every bit as fervently as you believe that Jesus walked on water using the power of God.  So why would I believe that Christian miracles true and genuine while Hindu / Muslim / Pagan miracles are human-created fakes?  Why do Muslims believe their prayers are answered the same way Christians do?  Does praying to Allah work?  If so, why?  If not, from whence comes this widespread belief?  If it's possible for hundreds of millions of people to be mistaken about the fact that their prayers are answered, is it possible that you're just as mistaken as they are?  This isn't just an issue for Christianity - all religions have the same lack of evidence for their supernatural claims.  You reject all of those claims, except for the claims of this one particular religion...why?  2.) Why believe the underlying claims in the first place?  I don't mean about Jesus etc, there's a ton to believe in before you can even approach the idea that Jesus was God.  First off, you have to be convinced that any gods exist at all.  I'm not convinced of this, so before you can meaningfully tell me word one about Jesus, you'll need to find convincing evidence that any gods exist at all.  Then, you need to be convinced that god or gods interact with humanity on an immanent basis as opposed to Deism.  Then you need to establish that there's one god, rather than many.  Then, you need to establish that the one god is the specific god described by the Bible and not any of the other possibilities.  Following this, you need to establish that the One God of the Abrahamic Covenant really did incarnate himself as Jesus and do all the things described by the New Testament.  At that point, you can finally start looking at which of the thousands of denominations of Christianity to accept, many of which are mutually exclusive despite being derived from the same scriptures.  If any of the links in that chain can't be conclusively demonstrated, the whole thing falls apart.  3.) Why does religion seem to be so closely tied with culture and geography?  As an example of what I mean, look at South America.  South America is overwhelmingly Catholic.  Why?  Is it because a long time ago, the smartest and most respected South Americans all got together and sat down and thought out the theology of Christianity and decided it was the most likely to be true?  No, they were conquered by Christians.  Full stop.  Read the chronicles - it's direct and explicit.  Prior to the Spanish, South and Central Americans had no concept of Christianity.  Then, a group of extremely motivated, technologically superior outsiders arrived and conquered the greatest civilizations on the continent, in the process destroying their temples and idols and replacing them with Christian iconography.  They enslaved the vast majority of the population and turned the rest into vassals, even as a smallpox epidemic ravaged what had been enormously powerful societies - the shattered remains adopted Christianity en masse and now, the odds that any given South American you meet will be at least nominally Catholic are very high indeed.  If we look at another example like North Africa, we see similar things happening with Islam.  So my question from this is ""are you really Christian because Christianity makes more sense than the alternatives, or are you Christian because you were born into an overwhelmingly Christian culture with Christian family members and authority figures?""  If you'd been born in Riyadh, do you think you'd be just as eager to defend Islam?  I do, because the people from Riyadh I've talked religion with have made the same arguments as the Christians...in favor of a false, man-made faith.  If the religion you believe in has so much more to do with who taught it to you than what it says, are religions really a good way of finding out what's true?  4.) Is faith really a good system for making decisions, especially decisions of enormous, literally eternal import?  Why is religion the one thing we take on faith, if faith is a virtue?  No one who decides the amount he's paying on his taxes on faith is virtuous.  No one who says ""I have faith this food won't hurt anyone despite the raw chicken"" is virtuous.  Only in religion is faith a virtue...religion, which we're currently debating as to whether it contains any truth at all.  What exactly is faith good for?  Why is it good to have faith, if so many people have completely misplaced faith in completely false religions that will send them to eternal torment?  No other decision you make has the potential to send you to a negative eternal outcome...except the one which you decide to take entirely on faith, a system you wouldn't use for an infinite number of far less important decisions?  I could go on at pretty extensive length, but these are a simplistic explanation of a few of the main objections to belief in general that I have.  The basic, underlying precepts of Christianity make no sense to me.  I don't see any reason to believe in the existence of sin, for example - what the Bible says about death not existing before ""sin"" (which originated with humanity,) is demonstrably inaccurate.  God's plan to redeem humanity makes no sense to me, nor do his requirements regarding our follow-up behaviors.  It all seems enormously man-made, exactly the type of things you'd expect primitive people to invent to explain the world around them.  I hope this helps!  Good luck with the stream.

Let's list off a few things here:  -Pretty much every other religion requires you to participate in some sort of religious ceremonies regularly. All Christianity asks is that you repent for your sins and accept Jesus as your savior, something that anyone anywhere can do without ever having to lift a physical finger. -The God in the Bible is drastically different from other gods in other religions. Just look at the Koran. Their Allah is the closest thing other religions have to the God in the Bible, yet he is still vastly different. -If your not looking at the Bible as a whole you aren't really looking at it at all. The amount of symbolism, foreshadowing, and overall depth crammed into it is astounding. When you consider it was written by dozens of authors, the connections drawn are all the more real. That's what makes it different from other holy books.  As far as the first part of your (1), honestly, I couldn't care less about whether or not Jesus really walked on water, or whether or not Moses really parted the Red Sea, or even whether or not the earth is 6000 or billions of years old. Those aren't even important in understanding the religion. It is what those stories and miracles mean is what's important. We could go on for days talking about that.  (3) I was born into a Christian home, I was raised Christian for as long as I can remember. I went to a Christian school up until the eighth grade. But it wasn't until my senior year in public high school where I sat down and really looked at my religion. Why did I believe? What was so special about it? Was it even worth my time? It was never real to me until I asked myself those questions and sought the answers. So no, I don't think I would have trusted Islam or something else if I had been born into it.  (4) First of all, God doesn't expect you to file your taxes on pure faith, or eat raw chicken and believe He will save you from it. He wants you to use your common sense and reasoning just as much as any atheist would ask of you. Without faith you haven't accepted Christ. It is as simple as that. Faith is literally the first step one takes on the path to acceptance of Jesus Christ. Does it look silly from an atheist's perspective? Of course, but it's something you have to experience and ""take a leap of faith"" to fully comprehend.  Thanks for wishing me good luck for my stream, and for taking the time to voice your opinions.

You see what I'm saying though, right?  You know how many Muslim kids don't really take it seriously until they sit down and think it through and realize Islam is the only possible one true religion?  If you go on /r/Islam you'll find people saying that exact thing on the regular.   So no, I don't think I would have trusted Islam or something else if I had been born into it.   You would have been different than the 1.6 billion or so people that it worked on, huh?  If you say so, although I don't believe that's true.   He wants you to use your common sense and reasoning just as much as any atheist would ask of you.    Except for as to whether believing in Him makes any sense at all.  Catholics are supposed to use common sense and reason except when they believe that a cracker and wine literally transform into human/divine flesh and blood.  That's what I'm talking about - food poisoning is important.  Taxes are important.  We don't take that stuff on faith because if we did, we'd hurt ourselves.  The only parts we take on faith are the parts that are completely made up.   Of course, but it's something you have to experience and ""take a leap of faith"" to fully comprehend.   I was a heavily committed Christian for two decades.  I mean, multiple worship services a week, Bible study, leader in church, prayed constantly, etc.  It's just not true, man, I'm sorry.  Look at the best responses you could muster up there - do you think you'd have such a struggle explaining literally anything else that you believe in this firmly?  The reason you're struggling is because the answer you're hoping is true doesn't really make much sense when you look carefully at it.  Again, good luck with the stream, but I wouldn't hope for much, conversion wise...the information age is not friendly to religious claims."

Well you are probably right, and the likely reason for that is I'm only 18. I'm struggling to back up my beliefs because I just don't know enough yet, about Christianity or about anything. However, I know enough to know that it's real through what I've experienced thus far.   You'll probably reply saying that eventually I'll learn the truth and turn away from God, and I won't deny that possibility. But I'll close with this. I honestly don't care if I have to fill in the holes with faith, because I've found that faith is everything, and so long as my experiences continue to support that, nothing will ever change.

Personally, I couldn't care less what you believe, as long as those beliefs make you act like a good person.  I'm not a fan of Christianity, which I think is not only false but profoundly anti-human, but I'd have to be crazy to say that it's bad for everyone all of the time.  For some people, it's a good thing.  As long as you're living your life fully and trying to help other people, you're a good person in my book.  Not that it matters, heh.

TrueChristian,3cxe8y,HideousAndSeek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:42:13 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Some of the basic, core teachings of Christianity are what I would describe as virulently anti-human.   Christianity teaches that all humans deserve damnation due to original sin, and that the only way we can avoid this is by accepting Jesus.  Personally, I think any belief system that says ""every human being, no matter how they live, is inherently evil and worthy of hell"" is anti-human. The Bible specifically says that our best works are ""as filthy rags"" in the sight of God.  That is not a pro-human belief system, it's exactly the opposite. God in the Bible kills off the entire population of the Earth at least once, despite the fact that he created us and knew exactly how we'd act.  If I adopted a dozen kittens and a few pooped on my rug, would the right thing to do be to kill them all and go get new kittens?  Can you imagine how many babies God drowned in the flood, if that was a real story (like people in the Bible believed?) Despite supposedly being the author of absolute morality, God is generally silent on rape and actively encourages chattel slavery. One of the key lessons of the Genesis narrative is that humans were wrong for seeking information on their own terms and should instead have mindlessly obeyed God, even before they were able to understand the concept of good and evil, right and wrong. Christianity teaches that humans were so bad, so irredeemably lost, that God had to incarnate himself and be sacrificed so that some of us would have a chance to not go to hell, which we all richly deserve because of our sin. It teaches that our good works are due to God's grace and our evil is the fault of our innately sinful nature.  The absolutely basic principle of Christianity is that works aren't enough to save you from hell, only belief through grace can grant salvation.  In other words, God doesn't care whether or not you're a good person; if you don't believe what you're supposed to believe and behave the right way, it's damnation for you.  ""No one comes to the Father except through Me.""   These are just the absolute basics.  Some denominations believe even more awful things, like the idea that some (or even most) people are essentially predestined for hell; i.e. they believe God makes people, they live on Earth for a few decades, then it's off to eternal torment for the rest of time.  Some denominations teach that belonging to another denomination is enough to get you sent to hell, no matter how sincere your belief.  I could go on, but those are a few of the reasons I think that."

But it's true. Let me give you an example. Do you have to teach little kids how to be selfish, lie, cheat, or steal? No, but you sure have to teach them how to be kind and gentle to others. Good attributes are learned, bad attributes are inherent.    Despite supposedly being the author of absolute morality, God is generally silent on rape and actively encourages chattel slavery.   God wasn't silent on rape. I don't know what Bible you read.  Genesis 34 tells the story of how Shechem rapes Dinah, the daughter of Jacob.   Verse 7 says ""The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing must not be done."" There's also Deuteronomy 22:25-27, “But if in the open country a man meets a young woman who is betrothed, and the man seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die. But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no offense punishable by death."" The slavery line is a common ""gotcha!"" tactic used by people to discredit Christians when debating sensitive topics such as homosexuality. However, you must understand that slavery in Biblical times was more similar to indentured servitude than it was to the African-American slave trade. People sold themselves as slaves to pay off debts, or to make sure that they had a house over their head and a place to sleep at night. The Bible acknowledges this and even calls for the masters to treat their slaves as kindly as possible. God even set a time limit on the slavery, similar to indentured servitude:“If your brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, he shall serve you six years, and in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. And when you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed. You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress. As the Lord your God has blessed you, you shall give to him. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this today."""

Long story short, what you're saying isn't true at all.  Humans have some predisposition towards selfishness (like all other animals) and also some towards societal cooperation.  It's the product of our evolution as social creatures.  Besides, think about what you're claiming.  Only a small percentage of the world follows Christianity, and only an absolutely tiny percentage of the world followed its predecessor religion - countless billions of people lived and died without ever hearing word one about Jesus or Yahweh, but somehow they all learned the same basics of morality that you know.  Morality is a human creation that we use to make our societies work better.  It's a social tool.   Deuteronomy 22   Uhh...perhaps you should read a few verses earlier in Deuteronomy, where God explicitly condones war rape.  That's the issue with your idea that God is the arbiter of objective morality - if he's OK with rape of captives (which he is, you have to shave their heads first though,) then your entire point about God's morality being unchanging and perfect collapses.  Also...you might want to investigate why the folks in Genesis 34 are so upset.  Hint: if the man in question had had a particular cosmetic procedure applied to his penis first, her father would have simply sold her to him instead of his sons seeking revenge.  Hmmmmm.   However, you must understand that slavery in Biblical times was more similar to indentured servitude than it was to the African-American slave trade.   Pardon my absolute disgust, but this idea is a modern lie.  It is absolutely untrue.  Chattel slavery, the exact form of slavery practiced on African-Americans, was present and commanded by God in the Bible.  What you are saying is something apologists have been trying to lie about since the conclusion of the American civil war.  Leviticus 25:44-46 is directly explicit that you may own foreigners for life and that your children can inherit them.  Your stuff about the Hebrews only applies to the Hebrews.  The form of slavery practiced by the hebrews on non-hebrews was essentially identical to modern slavery as we know it.  If you take nothing else from this, stop repeating this pernicious lie, you're dishonoring the memory of countless thousands of victims by doing so.  These people were slaves exactly in the way you and I understand the term, Hebrew indentured servitude was in addition to chattel slavery of foreigners, which God explicitly commanded.  There's a reason it's a common tactic used to discredit Christianity - it discredits Christianity.  God, the arbiter of perfect, objective morality, literally commands people to take slaves for life.  Is it objectively moral to do so or not?  Here's God on slavery-  look it up in your Bible if you don't believe me:  ""You may purchase male of female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel must never be treated this way.""  Again - all I have to show is that God was pro-slavery in some circumstances, and your whole idea of God's morality as perfect and unchanging collapses (unless you'd like to argue that what God is describing there is actually moral.)  When apologists tell you crap like that, go read the actual passages in the Bible, don't take them at their word.  Were you not aware that passage was in the Bible?"

I'm sorry, but you took that verse way out of context. I can prove that the Lord does in fact condemn slavery, with 1 Timothy 1:10. It says, "" We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me."" In this verse, slave traders are listed with murderers and thieves. I don't know about you, but that really doesn't look like God giving the thumbs up to slavery.  The Bible recognizes the existence of slavery and acknowledges it, but does not condone it. Exodus 21:16 explicitly says that anyone who kidnaps a man or woman to sell or keep as a slave should be put to death. Slave trading  is not condoned in the Bible. Neither is forced slavery. The only slaves that the Israelites were allowed to have were slaves that sold themselves willingly. Wouldn't it be kind of hypocritical for the Jews to come out of slavery in Egypt and then forcibly enslave foreigners themselves? God saying ""Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves"" is not a command at all. I was very aware of this ""gotcha"" passage.   You atheists need to stop taking verses out of context and parading them around like the proverbial skeleton's in the Bible's closet."
TrueChristian,3cxe8y,FaZe_Clon,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"As an atheist, I've always wanted to ask what makes the Christian God more valid or real than the thousands of gods that came before Him and still exist? I've seen Christians go so far as to mock other people's gods."
TrueChristian,3cxe8y,FaZe_Clon,4,Sat Jul 11 20:16:15 2015 UTC,"My answer would be because there is (at least I heard from somewhere) historical evidence for Jesus' existence.   My opinion is that the Bible explicitly mentions numerous times that Christians will be persecuted for their beliefs and we see that all the time today. Christians get beheaded in the Middle East. They also always have been and still are today imprisoned for their beliefs (in the Middle East). They suffer humiliation in developed countries.   Also the Bible states that there will be scoffers walking after their own lusts, and we see that today as well. Numerous Bible prophecies have been fulfilled and there are many yet to be fulfilled as well.   So to sum it all up, I usually look at what the Bible says and compare it to the world today and most (I'd personally say all) are relevant to what's going on around us. That's my reason why I find that Christianity is the only true belief out there."
TrueChristian,3cxe8y,metalmariox,3,Sat Jul 11 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but all of the prophecies that you just mentioned were either so vague or so likely to happen that just because the bible says them, it doesn't make it more valid. The fact that it says Christians will be prosecuted is obvious, considering that every single religious faith has been prosecuted at one point or another. The second one is just human nature. People always will, and always have done immoral things for their own wants and desires, saying that proves God is the one true saviour is like saying since the bible predicted that humans exist, then God must be the one true light."

TrueChristian,3cxe8y,wowsuchdrum,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"Correct, but there are specific events mentioned that has happened. Like the prophecy that Israel will become a nation once again, which has happened. And the numerous prophecies (like 300 or so?) in the Old Testament predicting a messiah and described Jesus so perfectly, and obviously that one has come true as well.   There's more to what I mentioned. I barely scratched the surface of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled and ones being fulfilled at the moment. I can't really name all of them because I'm at work and I'm on my phone.   But that's just my take on why Christianity is the correct religion. It also has the most fulfilled prophecies than any other religion. Plus it's a unique religion. All other religions teach that you basically have to dedicate your life to religious ceremonies to get to heaven, while Christianity presents a savior for all your sins and requires nothing to maintain your salvation. The only thing Jesus asks is that you dedicate your life to Him and not religious ceremonies, and even when you slip up and fail, He's still there for you and you won't go to Hell for failing.   However, regardless of what I say, I'll never convince you otherwise. Jesus says it takes faith in Him to know God, not evidence. So no matter what I say, it won't change your mind any. You have to do that on your own with help of the Holy Spirit, I can't produce ""evidence"" that'll make you all of a sudden turn to Christ."
TrueChristian,3cy25z,App1eEater,7,Sat Jul 11 20:30:04 2015 UTC,"I've worked on benevolence teams in the past. I've also been the recipient of charity and benevolence. So I've seen both sides on this.  First of all, if the resources aren't there, then they aren't there. You can't magic up money that doesn't exist. If God had plans for you to help this family again, the resources would be there.  Second of all, I do feel like there is a time when you have to say ""no"" to certain requests. It's not about refusing to help people, but when your resources are limited you need to carefully evaluate what the best use of that money is. I believe that the Bible commands us to take care of widows and orphans within our congregation,  so that is a high priority.  I also believe that immediate needs (like food and a place to sleep/clothes on your back) qualify as something we need to address for people immediately no matter their association with us or their faith. If somebody is hungry, I am gonna feed them. If somebody is cold, I am gonna try and give them a coat. Even as low income as I am, that's something I can do for just about anybody and I think the Bible tells us we should do those things. No stipulations are given regarding how many times,  so I'll help as much as I can.  Special projects like the one you described are something else entirely.  I've become a little cynical after working in benevolence, and have begun gravitating towards giving a leg up rather than a hand out for people who constantly seek help for special projects. Just because I feel like that is truly more helpful in the longrun.   The fact that they are calling you tells me they expect you to help them. I would move on, but maybe I'm just cynical."

What will be your answer when you can't provide that SAME service again to someone else? They will ask you, ""WHY can't you do that for me?"" and yes you will get insulted for it. There is a difference between helping people and doing a paid job.  My church has a weekly Food Ministry, where we give away food, sometimes drinks (not alcohol). What we get and how much of it we get is a suprise every week. I'm in charge of a portion of it and I play not favorites; people show up the entire hour and even after Wed. service starts. I have to help allocate all the food so that everyone that shows up, has an opportunity to get everything that is available.  I advise NOT to go to the congregation for donations. This SCREAMS of being overused. If there are members who are plumbers or work for a company then maybe they can get the company to help, NOT the church.

Do you have other projects in mind for this year that are a more pressing need? If you guys are only able to handle one project, then it is what it is. If that's the case, is it possible to refer them to a sister church in the area with a similar youth service camp that might have the expertise and funds for such a project? Is Habitat for Humanity or similar organisations a consideration?   Does someone in the congregation have contacts with a charity minded plumber or a relative with skills that might patch things up as a favor? Have you asked around? Have you tried asking your congregation for donations yet, or do you cringe at asking for that kind of help and just assume you won't get enough?   I get the feeling you've decided that they are really pushing it and you've already given all the help that they deserve. Maybe you're miffed that they didn't thank your team properly, or they sat around while you guys did all the work, or you think them asking for more help is impolite and demanding, or you think the effort should go toward one of the less fortunate families in your own congregation.   But if they really are struggling, especially if they have kids or elderly in the household, and all the money coming in is going toward food and rent and medicine rather than drugs and flashy cars, I'm of the opinion that you should at least try to somehow help if you have any ability to help. It doesn't have to be money, it can be arrangements or referrals.  And it definitely positively shouldn't be based on how much or where they attend church services.   If they truly have a need (not a want), you can't fault them for asking. I'm sorry, I have a soft heart because I grew up poor.

One thing to note is that all those authors do sometimes differ on what most consider to be secondary aspects of Christianity (the stuff where there is some wiggle room without affecting salvation). For example, RC Spoul says infant baptism is fine, while John MacArthur says adults only (and they openly admit to disagreeing with each other on this). But both agree on the essential doctrines.

Let love move you.  Don't grieve the Spirit. If the Spirit moves you, surrender and go with Him in power and strength.  God's rules are all for the good of all. Even Pork and shellfish were forbidden for good reason. Both at that time and even now we're harmful. Hookworm and high cholesterol in Pork. And living near pigs makes one vulnerable to swine flu. Influenza comes through pigs from birds, and mutates to become more able to infect humans because of pigs.  One of the greatest losses of life from a plague was the Spanish Flu. Arguably if we never cultivated pigs for meat, all those people wouldn't have died.  Shellfish and fish without scales or find are bottom feeders, full of toxins. Not healthy to eat. Not to mention allergies to shellfish can kill.  God has good trustworthy reasons for the things He asks of us.   We are free in Christ. Satan has been deceiving you."

TrueChristian,3cvr3v,Emperor_of_lce_Cream,2,Sat Jul 11 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. I was meaning to comment on your thread but then couldn't find it. (It has slipped back to the second page).  I can relate to you when you say, ""I've always had the desire to command my own universe.""  When I was on the very cusp of making a complete commitment to God, I felt this initial emotional resistance. I emphasise emotional because intellectually, I accepted Christian theism. God exists, is all loving and all good, and it would be amazingly irrational to know this an not devote myself to him. So what was holding me back?  And I realised that it was a desire to be my own separate entity. I felt like God was the sun and I was being asked to throw myself into the sun. The sun was the source of all goodness but it was so powerful that I thought my personality would be incinerated in the process and so I just stood on the edge of the world for a while looking down and hesitating.  However, couple of realisations and some C. S. Lewis quotes helped me to understand this hesitation better and overcome it.  1. God is the good  God does not possess some finite set of good things. God is the good itself. And this means that if I have some quality p which is truly good (intellectual autonomy, for example, was one I felt I would be losing) it has no possible existence outside of God such that, by giving myself to God, I must leave it behind. If p is objectively good and worth preserving, it can only be preserved by God and so I must devote myself to God to save myself.   2. We become more ""personal"" in God, not less C. S. Lewis wrote something which was incredibly helpful for me when I faced this fear of ""giving myself up"" to God:   It is no good trying to ""be myself"" without Him. The more I resist Him and try to live on my own, the more I become dominated by my own heredity and upbringing and surroundings and natural desires. In fact what I so proudly call ""Myself"" becomes merely the meeting place for trains of events which I never started and which I cannot stop. What I call ""fly wishes"" become merely the desires thrown up by my physical organism or pumped into me by other men’s thoughts or even suggested to me by devils. Eggs and alcohol and a good night’s sleep will be the real origins of what I flatter myself by regarding as my own highly personal and discriminating decision to make love to the girl opposite to me in the railway carriage. Propaganda will be the real origin of what I regard as my own personal political ideas. I am not, in my natural state, nearly so much of a person as I like to believe: most of what I call `me’ can be very easily explained. It is when I turn to Christ, when I give myself up to His Personality, that I first begin to have a real personality of my own.    3. Denying God requires one to renounce rationality itself The idea with quarrelling or opposing God on some rational precept is necessarily irrational when one remembers that rationality itself is contingent on and has its origin in God Himself. For example, your basic objection could be formulated into a reasoned proposition like, ""As a free agent, it would be better/preferable/more enjoyable/more conducive to individual happiness for me to be unbounded by any rule and to be able to build my own universe."" But, as C. S. Lewis writes,   There is a difficulty about disagreeing with God. He is the source from which all your reasoning power comes: you could not be right and He wrong any more than a stream can rise higher than its own source. When you are arguing against the very power that makes you able to argue at all: It is like cutting off the branch you are sitting on.   One more Lewis quote.  4. Evil is parasitical because it is contingent on the Good   To be bad, he [an evil man] must exist and have intelligence and will. But existence, intelligence and will are in themselves good. Therefore he must be getting them from the Good Power: even to be bad he must borrow or steal from his opponent. And do you now beg to see why Christianity has always said that the devil is a fallen angel? That is not a mere story for the children. It is a real recognition of the fact that evil is a parasite, not an original thing. The powers which enable evil to carry on are powers given it by goodness. All the things which enable a bad man to be effectively bad are in themselves good things—resolution, cleverness, good looks, existence itself.    This means that the thing I wanted to do, ""preserve my sense of selfhood,"" or ""remain the centre of my own intellectual life,""—in other words, exit as a being in some way—could not possibility be done more completely than through giving myself to the ultimate non-contingent source of all existence. Whatever is lost by doing so could not possibly have existed of itself anyway. Only the good in me can saved; only the good in me can endure. So I either give up whatever in me is not good (such as pride, a wish to build up a private inner world, maintain separate selfhood, etc.) or risk losing everything—which was the very fear that motivated my hesitation!  It all comes down to this: All goals seek some apparent good. But since God is the good, there can be no good without God. Therefore all goals that seek some apparent ""good"" that involves rejecting God are misconstrued and will fail by logical necessity. They cannot possible arrive at whatever ""good"" they seek; the ""good"" they seek outside God cannot, by definition, be good.  In the end, I saw that my hesitation was utterly irrational and unfounded: The thing I feared doing was being ""annihilated"" by God's love. But God does not wish to annihilate us. He wishes to save us. And the thing that ""annihilates us"" is Sin which God saves us from!  Hope this helped."

The best part of Christianity is the fact that you're never alone when you're concerned or feel lost, and there are many, many people out there rooting you on, wanting to help you out.  Maybe I'm not understanding you fully, but if I understand what you're saying - Everyone has flesh, desires, and things that may hold us back from going deeper with God. Part of maturing in Christ is to understand what weighs us down and to give ourselves more fully to God and to listen to what he wants us to do. I know that as I do more of His will (And bearing fruits in life), somehow all my questions get answered and I find myself way more at peace than I was before."

What I mean by that is: I can't find self-verifying principles in the bible, and this is fundamental to me. I don't feel my subjective experience is enough to hold my faith, as time drifts me away from that, and no more of such experiences occur, I'll start to forget why they were meaningful in the first place.

It's from Mark 9.  And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?” And someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.” And he answered them, “O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.” And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood. And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” And Jesus said to him, “‘If you can’! All things are possible for one who believes.” Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!” And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.” And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, “He is dead.” But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.”  You know what the power of God is through Scripture, so pray the prayer of the father in Mark: ""I believe; help my unbelief!""

It just carries too many implications of me being the one who has to convert someone, or me badgering them over and over about Jesus until they push me out of their lives because they're sick of it.   I try to do what Jesus did with people like Zacchaeus and His other followers. I try to live for God, and let that be an example of how living in God completely changes your life. When people around me notice the way I live and ask me about it, then I share the Gospel with them. I tell them about my beliefs, I invite them to come to church with me to see a whole community of believers whose lives have been changed by the Gospel.   If they start coming to my church and seeing real Christian faith in action, I tell them that I'll always be there to help them with questions if they want. And then, I just sort of wait. I know God will be moving in their hearts, and He's ultimately the one all of this rests on.   Remember, it's our job to make disciples, not to make converts.

Preaching the Gospel is the beginning of this process.  Discipleship is the entire spectrum of leading anyone closer to Christ, which begins with non-Christians and ends with workers and laborers living and discipling among the lost.  Here is an illustration I made, based off of LeRoy Eims' Lost Art of Discipleship (the structure is his), which should help clarify this.  The goal is never to ""make converts,"" for that's not within our ability or authority to do - only the Holy Spirit's.

No proponent of discipleship would deny that conversion is a significant milestone along the path of following Jesus.  It may be the part that some people are strongly gifted at, but it doesn't mean you can lop someone on the side of the road after they've said a prayer - or even if they refuse to say a prayer.  Conversion is a cause for rejoicing, but is not the end-game, and thus can only be viewed as a short-term goal (i.e. a way-point toward a greater destination), at best.  If your sole focus is making converts and not leading people toward Christ, you might be at risk of being one Paul describes in Philippians 1 - ""It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry ... out of selfish ambition, not sincerely.""  In my experience (and I am aware this does not apply to everyone), those who are interested in making converts without actually guiding or leading people closer to Christ or concern for their maturity after accepting Christ tend to do so blindly in extreme legalism or arrogance, trying to prove that they're better than another, or that they're worthy of God's calling, or that they can somehow make God happy with their works, or even just trying to prove something to themselves, as if their efforts can make them feel more validated in the genuineness of their faith.  All of these motives are wrong.  That said, even in the midst of those wrong motives, Paul concludes that section: ""But what does it matter?

If I speak ill of my boss to a friend, I do not necessarily need to go to my boss and confess, although I may have a need to go back to my friend and confess. If I secretly took a picture of someone while they were naked, the best thing to do may be to burn the picture. It would not be appropriate in many situations to go confess to that person. There is no sense in 1 Corinthians that the believers there were required to go back through their terrible lives and confess to others all of their sins, and they had many (see 1 Corinthians 6:9-11). There are a thousand situations where confession of sins known to you against another who is ignorant of the sin is not wise or appropriate. I often wonder where those who believe confession is appropriate in these situations go to find any Biblical support. Not even the Gadarene demoniac was called to go back and confess his sins. Rather, he was simply told to go tell the great things that Christ had done for him (Mark 5:1-19). This is what we should be telling people, that God has forgiven us and given us life."""
TrueChristian,3crsk2,ruizbujc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:28:28 2015 UTC,"I get where the article is coming from, but there are other factor's it's not addressing.  Do you have an ongoing relationship with the person?  Does that relationship involve trust?  Was there a previous commitment or expectation of trust with the person that was violated?  Has the person expressed that he/she would want to know about these types of things?  Is the Holy Spirit convicting you to tell the person?  Does your sin have an ongoing impact on the person's life?  For example, in the case of the girl on the street I lust after, I don't have a relational context with her, my sin doesn't have an ongoing impact in her life, there is no expectation of trust or communication, etc.  So, no ... there is no need for me to confess to her unless that context arises (for example, I later meet her at a coffee shop by accident and we become friends).  With my brother, there is an expectation of honesty and communication about things that affect his life.  We have a close relationship.  We communicate regularly.  I used to sin against my younger brother quite often, and I had to confess this to him, which wasn't fun, but served to build a respect in him for me, breaking the barrier of happy faces that we would otherwise have put on.  The boss situation is a little more difficult.  Does he like staying at arms-length, or is he more personal?  Is there a specific rule against gossip in the workplace, or do they just care about whether you get the work done?  Did your comment just elicit a chuckle or does it have an ongoing impact on how your co-workers view your boss?  Each of these scenarios is different and requires a different analysis.  That said, I also acknowledge that this is a general principle of love, respect, and honoring those you care about and is not a scriptural command of which I am aware.  Specifically, Matthew 5 presupposes there is existing enmity and Matthew 18 addresses when your brother sins against you and not when you do the sinning."

It is also something that could lead to conversations that many won't have time to type out.  So I will try to make it brief.  Jesus is GOD.  Son of God was to demonstrate His deity.  To explain to the Jews, who the message He brought was originally for, that He was God in the flesh, but still God.    Son of Man is to signify that He was fully human.  He didn't just appear like a man, He was flesh and blood human like every last one of us.  He was still deity but He put away the use of most of His deity to live as one of us to experience being one of us so that He could truthfully sympathize with us, and tell us, comfort us, etc., during times of tribulation and temptation.  The same goes for God calling Him His son.    Was He God's literal child?  No, since He was God, just in the flesh.  We have to keep in mind that the New Testament, same as the Old Testament, was a book written by devout Jews with that frame of reference.  A lot of it was even written to Jews, not Gentiles."

TrueChristian,3cnu06,instance_create,3,Thu Jul 9 11:39:22 2015 UTC,Agreed. Buying the software is the just thing to do.  Christians should not be engaged in IP theft. Took me too long to realize that.
TrueChristian,3cnu06,testingapril,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:07:17 2015 UTC,Why? What does the Bible say about intellectual property?
TrueChristian,3cnu06,CantHugEveryCat,2,Fri Jul 10 13:40:07 2015 UTC,"Exodus 20:15 - ""You shall not steal"". Therefore you should not steal intellectual property.  I think the common objection is that intellectual property is some sort of cultural invention, and therefore isn't actual property, therefore it cannot actually be stolen.  Theft is taking something of value away from it's owner without permission. IP, regardless of whether someone feels it should have value, does have actual value, therefore, taking it without permission is theft.  One might argue that the only reason IP has value is due to the law. Philosophically speaking, I would disagree with this, but I'll leave that alone since you asked about the Bible. In that respect, Romans 13:1-6 applies, saying ""Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established...Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience."""
TrueChristian,3cnu06,testingapril,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"Copying isn't stealing. No matter how you twist it, you can't equate the two. Intellectual property isn't property, much the same way that alternative medicine isn't medicine. If they were the same, the intellectual/alternative part could be stricken.  Does submitting to the authorities also apply to gay marriage?"
TrueChristian,3cnu06,CantHugEveryCat,2,Fri Jul 10 14:54:31 2015 UTC,"Copying isn't stealing.   You're right. Neither is buying. Neither is accepting a gift. Neither is taking discarded items (trash by the road for example). Neither is borrowing. But the key differentiator between all of those things and stealing is permission of the owner.  Now that I think about it. This actually strengthens my position. Every copyrighted piece of software comes with a EULA, which wikipedia describes as ""In proprietary software, an end-user license agreement (EULA) or software license agreement is the contract between the licensor and purchaser, establishing the purchaser's right to use the software. The license may define ways under which the copy can be used""  As a user of that software, one is bound by the contract that is encompassed by the EULA, and any Christian who enters a contract has a moral duty to uphold that contract according to scripture Including Matthew 5:33-37,  Exodus 20:16, and Leviticus 19:11. So, as long as the EULA prohibits copying the software, on grounds of honesty and duty to uphold contracts alone, software piracy is a sin. I may change to this as my primary argument for Christians to not engage in IP theft, but I will need to give it more thought.  I will continue below with a defense of my original argument because I believe it is valid and adds to the points I made above.   If they were the same, the intellectual/alternative part could be stricken.   My argument allows for it to be stricken. I made a case for why IP is property. What is your case for it not being property?   Intellectual property isn't property, much the same way that alternative medicine isn't medicine   This does not follow. Alternative medicine is not medicine, because it does not fit the definition of medicine. Medicine is ""the science or practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease."" Alternative medicine does not diagnose, treat, or prevent disease, and this is demonstrable. Intellectual Property on the other hand does meet the definition of property: ""something that is owned by a person, business, etc."" Therefore all IP is property, but not all property is IP. Alternative medicine is not medicine, so the same subset definition cannot be used, therefore this comparison does not follow.   Does submitting to the authorities also apply to gay marriage?   To answer your question, yes, in some ways. It means that as Christians we are probably going to take exception to our taxes going for purposes such as same-sex parental adoption, tax breaks for same-sex couples, and more. While we are free to peacefully protest these things, and voice our dissent of them. However we are not free to stop paying our taxes because of them. Similarly, we are not free to stop paying our taxes due to taxpayer funded abortion, although I've certainly thought about it.  Hopefully we can avoid getting side tracked on this tangential question."

I'll try to work in chronological order.  First, you are begging the question, also known as circular reasoning.   If intellectual property were property, there would be no need to distinguish it separately…since regular property laws would suffice.""   And how do you know that ""regular property laws would suffice?""  Because...   if intellectual property were a property, there would be no need to distinguish it separately.   So, in order to reach the conclusion, you have to presuppose the conclusion in the first premiss.  Second, you are making a false equivalency between intellectual property equals property and what the very definition of intellectual property which is a subset of property. Again, all IP is property, but not all property is IP. They are not equivalent, nor am I making a case that they are equivalent.  Third you may be making some sort of division fallacy. This is related to the false equivalency I outlined above. Possibly you think that parts of a whole have to have all the qualities of the whole. If this is the case, you are also assuming that ""property"" (the whole) has to have all the qualities of physical property (a part) and therefore intellectual property (also a part) cannot be part of the whole because it doesn't have the same attributes as the other part. Property can mean physical or intellectual or possibly some other state of things. Remember, I already defined property as ""a thing belonging to someone"" Thoughts and ideas are things, but they are not physical things, so it is not required to be a physical thing to fall under the definition of property.  How do you answer my argument about contracts and Christian's moral duty to uphold them?  Here's your last comment rephrased to be logical and fit with my actual argument. Read it in light of the things above.  Intellectual property is property, physical property laws apply on physical property, and intellectual property laws apply on intellectual property."

I'm using a copy of their program that I wasn't going to buy otherwise.  Drawing a direct parallel to theft is flawed, and I don't consider it stealing.  Mildly dishonest and unethical?  Yes.  Generally, I compensate for this by testing the program and buying an authentic copy if it's worth my time and money.  I want to support the developers, after all, so they will continue to make worthwhile products.  Think of it as taking a car for a test drive.  If it's good, I'll make a down payment on it.  Otherwise it's going back to the shop.  I do have a question for you, a hypothetic to turn the tables a bit:  Sometimes, customers will order food at restaurants, eat some of it, and then complain about the quality.

I guess the biggest issue I have is with people telling OP it isn't criminal therefore it isn't sinful.  It has at least dubious morality, which Paul and the other Apostles consistently exhorted the early church to avoid.    I suppose if you have found justification for your viewpoint, then praise God.

Printing houses had built their business model around government censorship, and needed a replacement after people got fed up with censorship and the censorship law was repealed.

You ask this as if it's somehow provocative or that it tarnishes God's morality (maybe this isn't your intent, but assuming that it is...). If I'm not mistaken, all of the Israeli governmental authorities of the Old Testament we're instated by God, none of whom were any more evil than Hitler. Sure, Hitler's actions were almost definitely more detrimental in a consequential sense, but one person is not more or less sinful than another. Unless we're talking about sheer 'number' of sins, which would be impossible to judge from our standpoint. So yes, God instated Obama and Hitler in the same sense that he instated Solomon, one of the judges, etc.: by allowing it.    Does that mean God approves of gay marriage?   Of course God doesn't approve of gay marriage, but that's irrelevant. You're equivocating the morality of gay marriage with the legality of gay marriage, which are two separate battles. Does God support the legality of gay marriage? No. Does God support our Government's right to choose to legalize it? Absolutely. The same is true for myriad other things. Cigarettes, for example, are almost unilaterally harmful to your body and others. Does God support smoking? Nope. Does God support allowing man the choice to smoke or not to? Absolutely.   Does that mean you cannot criticize your government?   This seems to be an ad absurdum based on your second points non-sequitor. God endows government with the authority to make certain decisions much like God endowed Adam and Eve.

TrueChristian,3cmq0f,NightwingASMR,8,Thu Jul 9 02:45:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, apparently automoderator doesn't approve of profanity, so I've removed it:  I don't interpret that verse (Ephesians 4:29) as necessarily being about profanity but about the meaning of what one says. After all, you can say good things and build up others while using profanity or hurt others with only ordinary words.   Some profanity is more benign than others, and it doesn't really depend on our societal taboo for it. For example, using the word ""[word that starts with dam and ends in n]"" especially against someone, is barely seen as profanity - you can say that on daytime television. But as Christians, it takes a very serious meaning and I think it's very wrong to say.  Similarly, throwing around ""oh my God"" when you don't mean to call out to God is not even cussing, but it's not honoring God's holiness. In my opinion at least.   On the other hand, something like ""[word that starts with sh and ends in it"" is obviously a swear word and will get censored but it's just a slang term for feces. There is no reason why it should be more offensive than ""poo poo."" Something like ""[word that starts with b and ends in itch]"" is where I think these two intersect. It is  tabooed to use, has a benign meaning describing a female dog, is a derogatory term against women, and sometimes just means complaining. But even when it's used in the sense of complaining, it's alluding to a derogatory, sexist stereotype of women. So that is one of the swear words that I believe is always wrong to use.   Then there's the fact that the definition of profanity is always changing. Describing someone as ""retarded"" is medically accurate, but has turned into an insult for the mentally disabled. ""Idiot"" and ""moron"" were once similar medical terms that have now become mild insults with much less taboo.   As for 1 Thessalonians 5:22, most translations interpret it as types/kinds of evil. Appearance (as in the KJV) is most likely the meaning that is synonymous with ""manifestation."" So, ""abstain from all manifestation of evil.""   So to sum up this WAY too long response:   The amount of taboo that society gives a particular word doesn't determine how wrong it is to say it. The meaning, the connotations and the purpose of its use are what determine if it's good to say."
TrueChristian,3cmq0f,of_skies_and_seas,3,Thu Jul 9 05:32:42 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the heart of what you're saying, but you're missing the bigger picture.   it doesn't really depend on our societal taboo for it   This is where you lost me.  Paul is very clear that we are to make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy (Hebrews 12:14).  If we go around violating cultural taboos, not only do we risk breaking a peace, but we cease to hold that which sets us apart (i.e. the meaning of the word holy).  As OP says, we must avoid even the appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22 - see the young's literal).  If culture views things as evil, even though the culture accepts it because the culture does not reject evil, do we want to associate something commonly viewed as evil and derogatory with the name of Christ?   is barely seen as profanity - you can say that on daytime television   Barely is not the same as ""is not.""  I could say, ""It's barely a sin to tell a small lie that doesn't hurt or affect anyone.""  It's still a sin.  Now, if you're in a culture that explicitly acknowledges that the d-word is not taboo or inappropriate or offensive in any way, we've got a different story.  That said, America isn't there yet.  And in either case, that goes back to the point that cultural taboo-ness does have a direct impact on the viability of the word.  In short, I agree with the concept that certain letters put together aren't sin; rather, it's what you communicate and how it is perceived that is sinful.  But if you know that some people are offended by the use of the word, even if they're the minority, it's wrong to use it around them.  If people believe the word is a ""bad word"" but aren't offended, it's still wrong to use it around them because you are connecting their understanding of ""bad"" or ""evil"" with Christ.  For this reason, although drinking alcohol is not sinful, I won't drink it in front of someone who does - even non-Christians who have a mistaken view about the Bible on this.   The amount of taboo that society gives a particular word doesn't determine how wrong it is to say it. The meaning, the connotations and the purpose of its use are what determine if it's good to say.   And to summarize my point of view, you're completely leaving out the connection people see between the word and the danger of their making that connection with us, as the image of Christ.  You're also missing out on 1 Corinthians 8 (v. 13 specifically)."
TrueChristian,3cmq0f,ruizbujc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"If you know you're going to insult or hurt someone by swearing, obviously don't do it. What I meant is that we shouldn't use societal taboo as a measure of what is right or wrong to say - hence the examples of sh*t being a far more tabooed word than casual throwing around ""oh my God"", even though its meaning is completely innocuous. Of course, we have to consider the person's feelings toward whatever we say to them - but that goes for everything, including but not limited to profanity.   I disagree with your interpretation of the Thessalonians passage. As I said in my first post, it is generally taken to mean any type/kind of evil. The more archaic ""appearance"" is taken to mean ""manifestation."" Here's an example of that common interpretation."
TrueChristian,3cmq0f,of_skies_and_seas,2,Fri Jul 10 02:16:19 2015 UTC,"I suppose in a private setting that might make sense.  But how do you know there isn't some ultraconservative in the restaurant table behind you that is going to be offended?  Or who over hears you at the mall?  Although the context is slightly different, I would say the description in Proverbs 26:18 fits this situation: ""Like a madman throwing firebrands and flaming arrows.""  You have no idea who's going to get hurt and how much and why.  As for 1 Thess. 5:22, my understanding is that the word could legitimately mean either way and that the context of the passage is insufficient to demand a specific interpretation.  That said, I may be persuaded as to this, though I can't say until I've done the research for myself :p"

But I can promise you once the spirit of God is on board and acting as a compass you will turn from ugliness. Ask God for his Holy Spirit to guide and give you wisdom. As you walk to wards God and away from this world the language is one of the first things that start to disappear. We should be different from the world, apart. Not because we think we are holier than thou but because the spirit is cleaning up our heart. What we used to love we begin to hate, what we once hated we now come to love.   I had a foul mouth before I became born again - reborn with a new heart - which I believe must be an on going process as he leads me into alignment with God. Swearing was so heavily ingrained in me and I thought nothing of it. In fact I enjoyed using it as a weapon. So much so my non believing partner would beg me to stop.   Although I did not flout it too much in public or around sweet little old ladies it was a habit that for the most part I viewed with little regard. How things have changed...  Language was one of the first markers I can remember leaving my life. I went from foul mouthed to not swearing. Now words I used with jolly abandon now seem ugly. I believe it is the spirit of God who takes out the ugly and replaces it with good.  It's not only happened to my language but he has cleaned up my heart, my soul, my life. He makes us anew when we are willing give ourselves up to him and determine to follow in Christ's perfect example. We have every bit of help spiritually, wisdom and discernment are two gifts we can freely ask for and receive when we become Gods loving obedient children.  You will know the spirit is directing you when your very internal workings start to undergo a spiritual overhaul. Just trust in God, seek him in truth and read his map. You won't worry about lines in the sand because your spiritual compass soon lets you know right from wrong. Take the journey getting to know God, seek all his promises to you, trust he will give you everything you will ever need to find the narrow path and stay on it unerringly. Peace."

It has to be a sincere repentance and turn towards Jesus.   Pray to God for the strength to overcome sins. Some sins go away instantly, some linger but you need to stop living in sin and doing the same sin over and over because that is not why Jesus died on the cross for. He came to give you liberty from the bondage of sin. No one is sinless and never sins but Jesus but there should be a difference in your life. Your life should be completely different than your life before Jesus because God lives in the believer and our desires change.  People are getting ideas from books and outside influences and I don't think it is helping people. Get back to basics and study your bible without commentary from man and let God teach you and guide you."
TrueChristian,3cki08,kjfriend,4,Wed Jul 8 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"But...repentance means what exactly? The popular explanation seems to be to stop sinning and follow Jesus. The literal definition seems to be just a change of mind. To say you have to stop sinning to be saved would be adding works to grace to earn salvation right? Or am I missing something?  My life is so much different than it was a few years ago, but it seems I've stagnated here and I want to keep moving forward to become as Christ-like as I can in this life. I used to be a horrible, not just athiest but laughed at people even my own family for believing in God or going to church. I was a thief, fornicator, drunkard, evil person with no remorse. I am no longer like that at all, so I know something is happening and I do believe I'm saved because Jesus and what he did for us is so real to me. I believe it wholeheartedly.

TrueChristian,3cki08,McVegetable,3,Wed Jul 8 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"You are on the right track for sure. Stopping sinning is impossible for us to do. The remorse and the desire to not do it again is the repentence part. Accepting Jesus is one part, repentence involves a desire to be with Jesus and like Jesus. It is a change of mind, and actions back it up. It's when you continue to live in sin and tell Jesus that you don't want to be forgiven of a sin that you should question your salvation."
TrueChristian,3cki08,allboolshite,3,Wed Jul 8 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"Yes I believe in grace through faith not of works as the bible says. Repentance means, ""to turn from"". Yes it can be a change of mind. The bible says to repent. We repent of our old life to turn to a new life. That doesn't mean we are sinless. It means we want a change from following our old ways of thinking and living as an unbeliever to humble ourselves before the Lord and give our life to God to lead and we follow Him. We no longer want to live as a fornicator, a thief  or a liar or a drunk or whatever but we put that title away and we no longer want to live like that. There are people who actually make up a God or go to a church that suits their life so they don't have to change and say God loves me and they accept sin. They say it is OK to live in sin and they say nothing negative about sin so people can feel good about being sinners.        Some sins will take some time with the help of Jesus but we don't desire to stay in sin and continue to label ourselves proudly in that sin. We don't say we are Christian drunks or Christian thieves or Christian adulterers. We leave that lifestyle to follow Jesus. First, salvation is by faith and secondly, obedience is by works. Jesus says, If you love Me, obey My commandments. How can we say we love Jesus but continue to live in sin or have pride in it? How can we be holy and follow Jesus if we live to sin and make it our life? You say you are saved and I believe you. You are in a better place than you think you are. Continue to read His word, pray, fellowship, give the gospel and do what God gave you talent for to edify His church. You have made changes in your life....I don't think you need to worry about salvation.

TrueChristian,3cki08,jmj1970,2,Wed Jul 8 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"This is what we Lutherans teach about repentance: (from Augsburg Confession)   Of Repentance they [we] teach that for those who have fallen after Baptism there is remission of sins whenever they are converted and that the Church ought to impart absolution to those thus returning to repentance. Now, repentance consists properly of these two parts: One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors. Then good works are bound to follow, which are the fruits of repentance.  They [we] condemn the Anabaptists, who deny that those once justified can lose the Holy Ghost. Also those who contend that some may attain to such perfection in this life that they cannot sin.  The Novatians also are condemned, who would not absolve such as had fallen after Baptism, though they returned to repentance.  They also are rejected who do not teach that remission of sins comes through faith but command us to merit grace through satisfactions of our own."
TrueChristian,3cki08,voicesinmyhand,4,Thu Jul 9 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"What you are asking about is sanctification. It starts when you accept Christ as your savior. That's called justification. As your faith grows and matures you get more sanctified, or Christ-like. You sin less and are tempted less. It's part of the ""fruits"" of your faith. Sanctification ends with perfection which is called glorification. With glorification you'll sin no more and you can be in the presence of the Father. That's the actual end-goal for Christians, especially when we refer to ""eternal life"".   Glorification isn't something that'll happen in this life (probably… how you interpret Rev may alter that…) and no matter how sanctified you get, you will still fail and sin."

I go through this too, even though I am 100% convicted that fixing myself faster than God is doing it is the wrong course of action.  It is true that sanctification by the Holy Spirit is way too slow to satisfy a human's desire to avoid guilt and shame.  Here's a short story that might help you... it helped me:  A silversmith purchased raw silver ore and began refining it so he could make it into something nice.  He had to heat the fire up quite a bit, making the whole shop very uncomfortable.  Worse, his crucible can only hold so much ore, so he has to repeat the process of purifying the ore over and over again.  Each cupful took days to purify, and oftentimes the silversmith would find that some gunk managed to remain in the silver after a few days of cooking it.  He had to stir the silver often in order to keep the garbage stuff burning off.  This process took weeks.  It made his house stink like burned garbage, made the silversmith tired, burned his hands a gazillion times too.  In the end, though, every time he looked into the crucible of silver, he saw himself... perfectly.  Even if he stirred the silver up a bit, he always saw himself.  In doing this, he knew that he had finished purifying the silver.  Your life is the same way.  You don't have bad crap just on the outside of you - the evil runs through and through every fiber of who you are.  If God just cleaned you up on the outside, you wouldn't be like Him, you would just look like Him.  He very much wants you to be like Him.  If you are a Christian (I am sure you are), then you probably want to be like Him too, and not just look like Him.  The process of sanctification was never intended to be pleasant, just like the refiner's work is unenviable.  It is filled with shame, regret, embarrassment, and failure.  A lot of people do a ""quick switch"" salvation, which doesn't really fix any of the sin in their lives, but sure makes them look nice.  EDIT:  Forgot to add the relevant verse:  Proverbs 17:3  The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the Lord trieth the hearts."

Thanks for taking the time to comment, it really did help me.   Not a lot is said, especially in church, about the issues that come up after you're saved. I guess the fact that I care about offending God and wanting forgiveness and salvation means I'm okay. What a relief."
TrueChristian,3cki08,GaslightProphet,6,Wed Jul 8 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"Not a lot is said, especially in church, about the issues that come up after you're saved.   What an understatement.

TrueChristian,3cki08,mlokm,3,Wed Jul 8 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I don't think /u/voicesinmyhand is trying to say that you should keep on sinning until you feel called out of it or to be patient with your sin.  Rather, you take all reasonable measures not to sin, but don't let it bother you when you fail, as this (like the smoke and nasty fumes) is an inevitable part of the process.  The patience should be with your ability to conquer the sin - not with the sin itself.  As Brother Lawrence said in Practice of the Presence of God, ""When I fail in my duty, I readily acknowledge it, saying, I am used to do so: I shall never do otherwise, if I am left to myself.  If I fail not, then I give God thanks, acknowledging that it comes from Him."""

I personally like being to be at a church where this isn't such a divisive issue."
TrueChristian,3clofm,GoodGuyTaylor,6,Thu Jul 9 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"Although the answers aren't concrete in scripture, I find no conflict between TULIP (as I understand each part in scripture, not necessarily as everyone else means it) and a doctrine of free-will (including as to salvation).  That said, here are my thoughts ...  Total Depravity - I believe it is undeniable in scripture that the inherent state of all of mankind is totally enveloped in sin and can do absolutely nothing to please God without first being regenerated by faith (Hebrews 11:6).  I believe that all salvation must be initiated by God and cannot exist without God enabling someone toward salvation.  Unconditional Election - I believe that there are those who are elected by God for a particular purpose and that such people did not do anything to deserve this election and that no amount of good works or merit can ever earn a place as one of the elect (or salvation for that matter).  I also believe that there are those who come to faith who are not specifically elected, but who have responded to God's divine initiation, and that such people also are not enabled to do so by their works, rather everyone is enabled, but the elect are specifically chosen.  Or, to word it another way, everyone is given the opportunity for heaven, but some people are denied the option of hell.  Limited Atonement - I believe that Jesus only bore the sins of those who through faith cast their sins on him, allowing him to bear their burden.  If all sins of all people had died and been buried with Christ, then all would be saved, and this is clearly not scriptural.  Irresistible Grace - I believe that if God wills something to be, no person can resist it.  Accordingly, although we may have a modicum of free-will, our will is always subservient to God's will when he so chooses to act.  In this way, if God chooses someone to be saved who would otherwise reject him, their will is conformed by God in an irresistible way toward acceptance.  Perseverance of the Saints - I believe that salvation is best understood as the ultimate and eternal fate of a person's soul.  If someone will eventually spend eternity in heaven, he is saved; if not, he is not saved.  In this sense, because God is outside of time, I believe that all who are saved are saved before they are born - even before the creation of the world, but that this status does not nullify the choices (both God's and ours) that led to its inception."
TrueChristian,3clofm,ruizbujc,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:31:08 2015 UTC,"I believe it is undeniable in scripture that the inherent state of all of mankind is totally enveloped in sin and can do absolutely nothing to please God without first being regenerated by faith   That's pretty bizarre, considering that those ideas didn't exist until later. The only way you can spin this as scriptural is by taking a few hyperbolic lines aimed at specific people out of context as neutral everyday absolute descriptions of reality."
TrueChristian,3clofm,bunker_man,2,Thu Jul 9 22:00:36 2015 UTC,"I don't see where you can take that view, and the scriptures are broadly applicable.  Romans 3:10-12 - As it is written: ""No one is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God.  All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.""  Hebrews 11:6 - And without faith it is impossible to please God  Romans 14:23 - Everything that does not come from faith is sin  These seem pretty clear to me, and I don't know any Christian who has ever held a view that without God (i.e. our inherent state) people are anything other than sinful all of the time."
TrueChristian,3clofm,ruizbujc,-1,Thu Jul 9 22:17:59 2015 UTC,"That was my point about hyperbole. You're reading single sentences written to specific people to emphasize humility as if they were broad sweeping statements that were meant to be literal and absolute rather than something you should read in conjunction with other seemingly contrary messages. Which would be bizarre to do seeing as how its not why they were written. But the new testament is pretty clear that Jesus is establishing a moral framework and that general goodness or being a ""sheep"" as opposed to ""goat"" is acting in it. Something that they established is done even by some non christians. When Jesus criticized people for calling him good, it was meant to be in the same way stoics say that everyone but a sage is ""insane."" Its not a literal denial that there's good and bad actions; which would be an absurd view, but pointing out that even ""good"" people are imperfect and should be humble, not think that infinite goodness literally emanates from them.   These seem pretty clear to me, and I don't know any Christian who has ever held a view that without God (i.e. our inherent state) people are anything other than sinful all of the time.   ? Tons of Christians hold that view, including educated ones. But you're making the mistake of conflating contemporary christianity with Jesus. What it culturally resulted as over time, starting even very early. Keep in mind that ideas like original sin which seem so central are just philosophies made centuries after christ. You need to keep in mind that while later philosophy is useful, that you can't conflate it with and project it back as if it was definitely a proper reading of the original texts. Its bizarre that people try to do this anyways even though protestantism exists as a deliberate pointing out that just because catholic culture was contemporary, and old didn't make it an accurate reading. So people who try to read their later developments into the texts are simply becoming the people they criticized."
TrueChristian,3clofm,bunker_man,2,Thu Jul 9 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"I have no idea where you're coming from on this.  It sounds like you're getting very defensive because I tread on the toes of some ancient viewpoint that you've held - and then you set up a straw-man by referencing a verse that I didn't even use and then explain how that verse doesn't break your view (possibly because that's the one you actually have a pre-set answer for?).  I'm not reading anything into the texts, I'm looking at them in their proper context.  Humility doesn't appear to be the message of any of those passages.  I have studied and meditated on each of these passages inductively with other godly men and accounted for a variety of presuppositions as well as no presuppositions.  Romans 3:10-12 is in the context of Paul saying that without Christ Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.  The passage before he talks about our unrighteousness as compared to God's.  Afterward he once again affirms that he's not talking about a particular people - he keeps using phrases like ""no one"" and ""not one"" and ""all"" and ""the whole world"" and ""Jews and Gentiles alike.""  This isn't a specific people group he's talking about - it's everyone.  The context is plain and undeniable.  Hebrews 11:6 uses the word ""whoever"" and the context is about people throughout time and referencing Jews and Gentiles alike.  Are you going to say that only some people can't please God without faith but others can?  Romans 14:23 once again uses the word ""whoever.""  It doesn't say ""whoever of you.""  The actual part I quoted uses ""whatever"" meaning that it is broadly applicable.  Are you going to argue that Paul only meant some things?  Can you give me an example of something that is not sinful even though it is done without faith?  Isaiah 64:6 says that there is no such thing, for even the things that are not only good, but righteous, are viewed as filthy rags to God, if not done in faith.  These are verses whose meaning (even in the Greek) is plain and obvious.  This isn't a modern view - it's the view of the apostle Paul and many people who have held to his teachings since then.  Did the early church stray away from such views at some point in its history thus necessitating someone else to resurrect it?  I'm sure it's possible.  But don't confuse sound theology with philosophy.  Philosophy seeks to reconcile conflicts between truths or to discover unknown truths through human logic.  Theology seeks to reconcile scriptural facts and explore the implications of those facts through scriptural exegesis and the guidance of the Spirit.  I don't mean to sound harsh, but this confusion is one of the most frustrating things I encounter with people who think they know more than they do - not to say that you are in this crowd.  Put another way, there are a million philosophies that can be believed without contradicting scriptures.  The view you hold could possibly, under some contortion of the scriptures, be held to be consistent with the scriptures.  But there is nothing in the scriptures that compels anything you have suggested - nothing that implies that we are inherently sinless or born good.  You seem to rely on beliefs held by the early established church while rejecting the views of the original church as stated clearly in scriptures.  Be cautious in treading that path.  There is an appropriate context for its use, but it is dangerous to give great weight to tradition as on par with scripture directly."
TrueChristian,3clofm,ruizbujc,-2,Thu Jul 9 23:31:50 2015 UTC,"Calm down. What you are saying I said isn't even what I said. I don't know whether you care, but paul is not Jesus. He's another early christian, who your only argument for deciding his opinions are core to christinity is defining christianity as including paul in the core, even if he contradicts Jesus.  Yous post is more or less rambling though. You don't need to write eight paragraphs about the tone a single out of context line was said in. Imagine outside of religion right now you were talking to someone who thought they were near perfect and so no moral issue applied to them. Naturally your response is hyperbolic language explaining that their approach is wrong. It would be absurd to take that and assume that somehow it makes nihilism true."
TrueChristian,3clofm,bunker_man,3,Thu Jul 9 23:45:34 2015 UTC,"Not heated, so nothing to calm down from :D  Sorry for the long post, as I tend to be wordy quite naturally (I'm an attorney, so I've been trained to be that way).  I'll try to keep this much shorter.  You're right that Paul is not Jesus, but his writings are Spirit-inspired, and thus hold the same weight, for the Spirit speaks with just as much authority as the Son or the Father.  Nothing Paul has written contradicts Jesus.   Imagine outside of religion right now you were talking to someone who thought they were near perfect and so no moral issue applied to them. Naturally your response is hyperbolic language explaining that their approach is wrong.   If I understand you correctly, you're saying that Paul is speaking to people who thought they were near perfect, so they would have interpreted Paul's speech as hyperbole, thus that must be the correct interpretation.  I'm guessing this isn't what you mean, as that's clearly flawed thinking and that interpretation comes from the viewpoint of the author and not the audience (although the understanding capacity of the audience can be a factor in helping to ascertain the intent of the author).  In any case, I see no contextual cues in the English or the Greek that even hint that Paul is speaking in hyperbole.  To be fair, I haven't studied the Hebrew with regard to Paul's quoting the old testament, but I imagine the prophet isn't speaking in hyperbole either."

TrueChristian,3clofm,bastianbb,3,Mon Jul 13 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"TULIP is an attempt to explain the logic underneath many of the statements in the bible.  While I am partial to TULIP, I find it hard to make it the forefront of any argument because scripture does not make it the forefront of any argument, instead scripture deals with things like faith in Jesus Christ, love, bearing burdens and being willing to put up with the weak.  I think if you take a hardline stance against people who are on the other side of the isle than you on topics the scripture does not emphasize, then you're really ""straining the gnat, but missing the camel"".  I think any wise Christian will be able to take a confident stance in their logic while being humble and gracious towards those who disagree.    Edit: typo"
TrueChristian,3clofm,redpandapaul,3,Wed Jul 8 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"TheLutheranSatire wrote recently    Calvinist God: ""You have to love and forgive everyone who sins against you. I don't, but you have to.""    Moving past that insight into Calvinist theology, the idea of Limited Atonement is, perhaps, the worst of the false doctrines put forth by the Calvinists. How horrible it must be for someone moments away from death to simply know they may be on their way to hell because part of that doctrine says that they even though they thought their faith was real, even knew it was real, had every inward and outward appearance of their faith being real, and that they would be saved, but were members of the group simply deluding themselves. The false doctrine of Limited Atonement robs people of the assurance of their salvation. For as Mark 16:16 says, if you have faith and are baptized, you will be saved. It does not say you might be saved, it says you will be saved. It does not say, nor does anywhere else in scripture say, that one need be uncertain of their faith. If someone is asked if they have faith in God, and they honestly answer “Yes,"" they will be saved. Only if they answer “no,"" might they end up in hell.   Where does this faith come from? It is a free gift from God which He has promised to create and strengthen through His word and His sacraments, properly preached an administered.

TrueChristian,3clofm,jmj1970,2,Thu Jul 9 11:43:47 2015 UTC,"TULIP is  IMO, a two-dimensional answer to a three-dimensional reality. It's an attempt to define God, and put Him into a set of rules that He must abide by. All the while arguing against free will by arguing that He is 'sovereign' and controls everything. Which in of itself begs the question that, if God is truly sovereign as they say, then why must He abide by Calvin's Cleland Boyd McAfee's rules? God has a tendency to break His own ""rules"". He tolerated polygamy, divorce, the sin of David, and the very sin of man to hang on a cross, just to name a few.   God has no time, therefore, he can see what we will do, not just before we do it, not just in the beginning of time, but always knew what we were going to do at this very moment and each moment after. Thus, he has adjusted accordingly, since the beginning. I look at it this way: if a parent puts two bowls in front of a child, one of a healthy vegetable, say broccoli, beets, or canned spinach (I hate canned spinach...and canned beets), and a bowl of ice cream, knowing the child will always choose the ice cream, does that in anyway remove the free will of the child to make the choice, or his responsibility after making it? No. The child has always had the choice to choose the opposite. Admittedly, in God's case, it isn't just an educated guess, but a direct knowledge of events throughout material time - the exercise of free will isn't dependent on the knowledge of actions by other parties, it's dependent on the ability to choose between two or more options. Adam & Eve had the ability to choose to listen to God; they didn't. Same goes for everyone else.  Free will does not compromise God's sovereignty if God chooses to allow it. Yes He can control us if He chooses, and it is His right to do so; but He does not because it is His will not to. While God can be extremely persuasive, He chooses not to force someone to follow Him. Note Christ's three attempts to get Peter to follow Him in the Gospels, eventually He the miracle that Peter needed to see in order to believe. He persuaded Peter; not hitting Him with a coercive method like ""irresistible grace"".  He did the same to Paul, and I bet, the same to you and I. Note the order laid out in [Ephesians 1:13] : Listening -> belief -> sealing. If Irresistible Grace was the law by which God operates, sealing would be first, and listening would barely enter the equation.   Many of the scriptures used to support these believes are taken out of context and co-text. The ""elect"" is from the Greek, ""eklektos"", which is always plural, it means the church! How would you reconcile the ""elect"" from the Calvinist view with a verse such as [John 3:16] or [1 Timothy 2:3-6]? They add meaning to the term that, if it was indeed there, would mean the bible contradicts itself, and is therefore uninspired. A rational reader would take another look at the text, context and co-text of those verse and come to the conclusion that it doesn't mean what they say it does.    /u/versebot"

I'm sure I missed a lot on my first time through but it still helped me to understand where a lot of Christian principles have their roots.  It also brought me face to face with tough chapters and verses in the bible and made me question them, roll them over in my mind and ultimately research and understand them, giving me the ability to see and drop certain assumptions that I was unconsciously holding that go against the bible (incorrect things like ""no one has the right to kill anyone, not even God"" or ""one's happiness is the most important thing in their life"").  Therefore I'd suggest not worrying about ""doing it perfect the first time"" (also since there's always your next read-through), and just making sure you do it, because it really helps make Christianity something you believe in rather than something you believe in because others you love/respect are believing in it.

It's different than what I posted, it's a little less metaphorical, a little less ""ethereal"", and a little more ""80's soft rock"".  I like songs that put Jesus's name unambiguously because I think some don't do it because they are ashamed of him to some degree.

The genders can't be the factor, unless you're insisting that either men or women are being denied their services.  Look, I appreciate that the modern game of the person who hates Christian teaching is 'Find any way, no matter how much of a legal stretch, to force people to do as you say'. But let's get right to the point: the Christian thing for same-sex couples to do when faced with someone who will provide them service, yet don't want to participate in their mock-wedding, is 'leave them be'.

I think the issue is that Christians view gay marriage more like the first case and their opponents view it more like the second. A birthday party, by itself, is innocuous, a skinhead rally isn't. The issue is that opponents view gay marriage as innocuous and Christians simply do not, as they deny it's even a valid thing (and recognizing it is akin to denying the passages that touch on this matter).   So, question: do Christians have the right to not view gay marriage as legitimate? Do they have the right to say ""I personally don't want to have anything to with it, although you can still yourselves do it out of sight and mind?"""

If one will ultimately spend eternity in heaven, that person is saved, otherwise they are not saved.  In order to be saved, one must admit he is a sinner, that his sin separates him from God, and that he cannot overcome his sin by himself; believe that Jesus died and rose from the dead as the only possible way of conquering sin to reconcile us to God; and love God/Jesus/Holy Spirit by committing one's life to modeling the image of Christ.  Following the teachings of Jesus and living by his example are insufficient.  As /u/jonathaniam pointed out, you must also love Jesus.

Jesus's death on the cross provided a payment for the debt we owe and for the unrighteousness we will be judged for.  He received the penalty of death as a substitutionary sacrifice, placating the wrath of God that is being stored up for judgement... thus anyone who believes in him, receives the salvation of their souls, but that's not all, in his love God also gave us the seal of the holy spirit and adoption as children of God through Jesus.    If you recognize your need for a savior and accept Jesus's death on the cross as the source of your salvation, you will be ""born again"", your name being written in the book of life, allowing you to pass safely through judgement.    Revelation 20:11-15     Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.

I never felt like it was meant to represent a contract of if you do this for me I do this for you. In the Old Testament, God said that sacrifice must be made to be pure and to be with God, a relationship with Him.

TrueChristian,3cil34,jonathaniam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:07:17 2015 UTC,"To answer just the question 'what is salvation?'  What we need saving from is sin.  This simplest way to understand this is that because of our personal sin, at the day of judgment God's wrath will be rightfully upon us. We will be guilty before Him of violating His perfect standard of right and wrong, and we will be punished accordingly. We need to be saved from this fate.   But being saved from sin means so much more than that. Because of Adam's sin we are under a curse of death. Both ourselves and everything and everybody in the world is under the curse. We were made to passionately enjoy God forever but because of sin we are alienated from Him instead.  We were made to live but because of sin we die. We were made to be happy but because of sin we toil in pain and have heartache and sickness and injury and anger and hatred and every other bad thing we can imagine in this world. Because of sin we are enslaved to behaviors that are harmful to ourselves and others. And we have to suffer the consequences of other people's sinful behaviors. The very nature of our being was made to be joined with God but we are separated from Him and thus dead inside compared to the life we were meant to live. And being saved from sin ultimately saves us from all these things and much more. And it all comes through what Jesus has done for us, but that is in the 'how,' not the 'what.' I will say there is no such thing as being saved in the 'loosest of terms.' It's either all or nothing! God bless!"

Their arguments against God are refutable.   His primary problem is his training is in science rather than philosophy. The supporters who I talk with tend to make philosophical arguments using scientific reasoning instead of philosophical reasoning. Steven Hawking, who I have read, makes the same mistake in his book The Grand Design where he attempted to use logic to argue against using logic to draw conclusions.   Now to your question, Dawkins argues that the odds of a designer are smaller than the odds of, what? The odds of spontaneous creation of matter and energy out of nothing? The odds of an eternal universe? Both of these options have been disproven with such a high degree of certainty that there would have to be some evidence against the possibility of the existence of God for the statement that he is less likely to exist to be justified."

At least he's honest.  But then, Dawkins is, too. He stands with Lewontin when he says:   ...we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.   Doesn't get more honest than that. ""I know it looks intelligently designed - but I don't care!""

TrueChristian,3cfviq,ChristianDefence88,7,Tue Jul 7 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"I've read it and it almost seems as though I can respect Dawkins for his contributions to evolutionary science, it almost seems as though he has no clue what Christianity is about, or even what faith is.  Perhaps his target audience is those who consider themselves Christian without thinking about what/why Christians believe. Seriously some sections he bangs on about faith, of the supposed blindness sort, which is totally alien to me. Faith is like trust in a friend who has helped you in the past, and when you need help will come to help you again based on the information you know about him.  Also, quoting Martin Luther on Reason without immediate literary context, the immediate social context, and without the broader historical context is meaningless.   Luther takes a very dim view of human reason. In the temporal affairs of human beings in the kingdom of earth, “the rational man is self-sufficient.” But in the eternal issues of life in the kingdom of heaven, “nature is absolutely stone-blind” and human reason is completely incompetent. Worse, reason is an enemy of God, “the devil’s whore,” whom Luther nicknames “Frau Hulda.” Reason was responsible for the distortion of the gospel by the Scholastics, who had tried to reconcile the gospel with Aristotle. For Luther, Aristotle was “the stinking philosopher” (rancidi philosophi, one of Luther’s more polite descriptions of Aristotle), “that noble light of nature, that heathen master, that archmaster of all masters of nature, who rules in all of our universities and teaches in the place of Christ.”   -https://bible.org/seriespage/17-fideist-apologetics-faith-alone#P38_14543"

TrueChristian,3cfviq,JoeCoder,2,Tue Jul 7 17:34:49 2015 UTC,"I own the book but never read it after finding out it was more about theism than it was about evolutionary biology.  I should've got the greatest show on earth instead.  I also reject the idea that "" Christianity was meant to be irrational"".  Proverbs 14:15 tells us ""The simple believe anything, but the prudent give thought to their steps"", and Jesus himself dealt in the currency of evidence.  John 14:11, ""believe on the evidence of the works themselves.""  Theism claims God is the first cause of the universe.  Normally we calculate the probability of things through the probability of the events leading up to them.  But by definition a first cause has no such events.  However, even if you were to ignore that and try to caluclate probability anyway, I still think God is a better explanation.  Atheist physicist Roger Penrose calculates the odds of a random universe having entropy as low as our own to be one in 1010123 (note the double exponent).  This comes from all 1080 particles in our universe each having its initial properties fine-tuned to a high degree.  For comparison, Earth has about 1050 atoms, so I would think even having a brain the size of an entire planet would be more probable than that.  Not that I think Brain and Mind are the same thing or that mind even has to be complex.  Mind could be a fundamental property of the universe itself, something like an intelligent philote in the Ender's Game universe.  Dawkins has also said that even if he saw the second coming of Christ, he would sooner believe it was caused by aliens than by God.  In that I see not rationality, but a strong desire to believe in anything but God.  Not that fine tuning of physics is the only argument for God.  I would love to discuss Dawkins' thoughts on intelligent design in biology if you want to share them here."

The answer to every problem anyone could ever have with the Bible seems like blissful ignorance at its finest at first glance. However, it is important to note that there is a reason we as dedicated Christians hold faith to such a high standard. Through our faith we have witnessed miracles first hand, God doing the impossible for us whenever it mattered, and any doubt we held shattered again and again by  God's constant reminder that He is with us and is looking out for our needs. We have very good reasons for our steadfast faith, and there isn't much science can do about that."

For example, I can say that the odds of picking a Jack of Spades from a full deck of cards is 1:52 (value).  But that doesn't tell me what the next card will be (prediction).

TrueChristian,3cfviq,rethcir_,3,Tue Jul 7 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"I think that there is a false disconnect here between reason and faith. No one, Biblically, ever said faith was separate or unreasonable. Quite frankly, faith doesn't refer to blind belief, but rather trust- one that is based on knowing the Lord. That doesn't mean that you can't contemplate the Scriptures with new discoveries and theories. There is a reason God gave us prophecy, so we would believe when events happen. He did miracles, not just to make us feel good, but to display His authority.  We were given brains and rational thought for a reason, and denying that rationality has anything to do with God is a false division. I don't doubt that that Martin Luther quote was taken out of context.   Reason is a whore. It can be used to justify whatever one wants and to serve the person making the argument. Reasonably speaking, we should kill anyone who is sick to prevent the spread of disease. Though, also, reasonably, we should care for these people and bear the burden. Reasoning largely depends on worldview and conclusions to which ha person is willing to jump. The existence of God is unreasonable for an unbeliever, because it does not fit their bias and worldview.   Now, I am not here to argue or outright accuse, but your statements seem to indicate that you intend to incite doubt and argument. It is perfectly reasonable to think Jesus would die for our sins, that the Lord is our Father, and that He is the Way and the Light."

I definitely disagree with what you said here though:    Perhaps it Christianity was meant to be irrational, just as God sending his only son to die for the sins of humanity is not something that we can justify with reason.

Have you ever read that thesis on the probability that we are living in a computer simulation? Essentially it argues that if you accept that computing will eventually get to the point where we have the power to intelligently simulate a universe (this seems like an outcome a reasonable person must accept is possible at some point in the future to me), then you must also accept that it's a possibility we are currently in one? Now,  If you accept this, you must also accept there is some possibility there is an intelligent designer (or designers) no? I have this conversation with multiple Dawkins Devotees and I find it interesting that most of Dawkins followers (in my experience)  agree with the possibility of living in a simulation but can't make the logical jump to accept that someone or something must be running it (this is the closest to a 'God' you could get most to accept but they've all just put up a wall to me at this point, despite being friends who can normally discuss matters we disagree on quite well) . I guess it's because their level of rationality has risen to a point where it is a religion in and of itself. (disclaimer I don't think it's a simulation but the argument is interesting and one that goes well with the way in which these individuals usually want to discuss things)   Also there have been a few posts with great resources about the eventuality of the current universe coming from an intelligent designer,  to be far more likely than the current evolutionary theories.

An excerpt that is relevant:   The only way to doubt Christianity rightly and fairly is to discern the alternate belief under each of your doubts and then ask yourself what reasons you have for believing it. How do you know your belief is true? It would be inconsistent to require more justification for Christian belief than you do for your own, but that is frequently what happens. In fairness, you must doubt your doubts. My thesis is that if you come to recognize the beliefs on which your doubts about Christianity are based, and if you seek as much proof for those beliefs as you seek from Christians for theirs — you will discover that your doubts are not as solid as they first appeared.    Keller spends a chunk of the book reframing some of the discussions surrounding belief and origins of truth. It was very helpful for me to use those as thought exercises.

Dawkins' argument is that the odds there existing a Creator that could create all that we see and are, is even smaller than the probability that the big bang resulted in the earth's origins.   Which only makes sense if someone considers God to be 'A being whose origin is that of a random event in the universe'. It's an utter non-sequitur, and there's a reason the Ultimate Boeing 747 argument doesn't get used much even by atheists at this point - it's embarrassing.  And it gets worse than that. Dawkins wrote that way before the multiverse mania kicked in. Now, you have people postulating that an infinite number of universes may exist, with randomly shuffling starting points/laws/etc to go with them. (Note: No, not every multiverse theory does this, but it's floated as a live possibility.) If one takes God as 'a being which can come to exist by chance but, darnit, the odds are just so remote', the multiverse makes God's existence literally guaranteed. Multiple times. Polytheism, by that view, is scientific truth.  That's just to begin with. But no, the biggest horror I had when reading this book was the realization that 'Some people think these are deep arguments.

TrueChristian,3cdts6,voicesinmyhand,3,Tue Jul 7 03:24:05 2015 UTC,"Hello! While I am by no means an expert, I am currently counselling a friend & sister in Christ through some OCD centered on exactly the anxiety that she has / may have committed the 'unpardonable sin'.   Before I start, I also hope /u/stevyjohny (who posted elsewhere in this thread) will read this post, as I will be trying to address his question as well.     First, let's look at the specific example & context where Jesus brings up the 'unpardonable sin'; Matthew 12:32. A few verses (v. 22) prior we see that Jesus had just driven out a demon in a blind & mute man, and the (onlooking) people were astonished. They said that Jesus may be the messiah. The Pharisees then, overhearing & perhaps also watching this situation, tell the people - in Jesus's own presence - that it is not by God's power he casts out demons, but by the devil's (v. 24)   Then the next verse is very important to our understanding, (v.25) the bible reads; ""... knowing their thoughts , [Jesus] ..."". This verse is important for understanding the unpardonable sin correctly, as it demonstrates that with the unpardonable sin (as with all sin) there is a thought component.   The Pharisee's had a vested interest in denying their messiah, and getting the populace to deny Christ too. Their denouncing Christ's power as devilish was a tactic to deceive the people and get them to reject the messiah. We know from other passages that part of the pharisee's reasons for denying Christ's advent was that he was not 'behaving' as they thought the messiah should behave. They wanted the conquering king, not the suffering servant, and they wanted to be glorified themselves for keeping the laws, in that first coming, for all their work.   After their denunciation of Christ's power as the power of Beelzebub, Christ goes on a spiel about a house divided (v.25-30), and then gets to the unpardonable sin (v.31-32).   From the context in Matthew 12, X things are reasonably clear:   1) Being confronted with a miracle done by the messiah, and denying its power, is blasphemy of that power (i.e. the Holy Spirit)  2) Blasphemy against the Son & Father, and all other manner of sins can be forgiven, but not blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.  3) These pharisees blasphemed the holy spirit.    As /u/stevyjohny asks: ""Can a person commit this sin, while still living, and have no possibility of forgiveness?"" Which is a very relevant question.   The answer, I believe, is that ""yes, they can; but it is fairly difficult to just accidentally do."" Why do I think this?   If the pharisees had not had a vested interest in denying the advent of Christ, and were simply skeptical of Jesus's miracle-working-powers, they likely would not have said that 'he does his works by Beelzebub'. Their internally preconceived (relative to that moment) rejection of the messiah lead them say that he did his miracle by the devil, to deceive the people that were onlooking.   If I today, were a skeptic, and saw a christian perform a miracle in Christ's name (hypothetically), I could have one of three reactions: 1) That was a miracle, by God! Amazing!; 2) How did that christian do that? Such things are impossible!; 3) That was no miracle by God, but by magic or Satan/Zeus/Thor/Vishnu!.   In cases 1 & 2, I have not blasphemed the holy spirit; in 1 I acknowledge the truth of the situation and in 2 I am skeptical but could still be reproved. But in 3 I am pre-disposed to reject the idea of God in favor of an idol. So in case 3, I may have committed the unpardonable sin, but it is still unclear.   If in case 3 I then go onto say: ""This christian works miracles not by his God, but by Zeus! All you people hear me and understand that I am just saying this aloud to deceive you and hinder you from listening to this christian!""   Then I am certainly ""speaking against the Holy Spirit"" (Matthew 12:32). And am therefore certainly committing the unpardonable sin.   However, in case 3; whether I spoke aloud or stayed quiet while rejecting the miracle, it is important to note that my heart was already hardened to the things of God. I had, like the pharisees in Matthew 12, a vested interest in the miracle not being done by God.   Jesus throughout the Gospel accounts calls the Pharisees 'vipers' (Matthew 12 & 23); and in the parable of the prodigal son Jesus reveals the pharisee's inner thoughts. The 'good son' who stays at home but is jealous of the prodigal son's return is a type of (or a model of) the pharisee's attitude towards the unrighteous receiving salvation. In Mark 2:17 & Luke 5:32, Christ says he has not come to call the righteous but the sinners. In Luke 18:19 & Mark 10:18, we see that there is actually no one who is righteous. The pharisee's, in their pride, believed themselves righteous; but it was a false righteousness. The parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:28-29) we see that the 'older son' refuses to go into the house with the Father and the prodigal son, as his jealousy demands that he be rewarded for his many years of faithfulness to the father. The pharisees are similar in their attitude in that they believed themselves righteous and demanded (in their hearts) to be rewarded for this.   /u/voicesinmyhand Says:    Blaspheming the Holy Spirit [is ...] weird, but Christians do it all the time. Any case where we try to fix ourselves instead of relying on the slow work of the Holy Spirit, we are taking the job of the Holy Spirit as our own. In such a case, it's not so much that the Christian can't be forgiven, but rather that the Christian has abandoned God's forgiveness and instead clamped down hard on his own version of forgiveness.   This, I think, is correct in spirit, but really really scary wrong in its wording. I totally agree with /u/voicesinmyhand , in that blasphemy of the Holy Spirit happens ""all the time"", but not by those who are truly Christian. It simply cannot. Why? Because Jesus tells you why in the same verses of Matthew 12.   Matthew 12:25-28:    25 [...] “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. 26 And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.    If the Holy Spirit indwells us (1 Corinthians 3:16), as it is written, as Jesus's words in Matthew 25 are also true, then a true Christian CANNOT commit the unpardonable sin. How would or could the Holy Spirit dwell in a person that blasphemes himself?   However, I do agree that many non-believers, commit the unpardonable sin ""all the time"" (as /u/voicesinmyhand says Christians do). It is written in Romans 1:18 that unbelievers ""suppress the truth by their unrighteousness"". They supress it, as the rest of Romans 1 explains, everyone knows God and the truth, but many who do not repent and believe supress the truth of his existence.   Many unbelievers have a vested interest in God not existing. And so they deny his power (like in case 3, above); and sometimes speak their falsehoods aloud (also, like in case 3 & the pharisees in Matthew 12).   God knows their hearts, and can tell if they are committing the unpardonable sin; but it is important to remember that the unpardonable sin cannot be committed without first already being in a state of rejection. A mindset that what God says/does cannot be, because it would mean they (the unbeliever) are in the wrong.   Without that mindset, which is the mindset of the Pharisees that Jesus references in Matthew 12:25, that truly makes the unpardonable sin, unpardonable; as opposed to genuine skepticism.   So, yes /u/stevyjohny , I believe the unpardonable sin can be committed, while still living in this day & age. No, /u/voicesinmyhand , I think you are scary-scary wrong to believe that a true Christian can commit the unpardonable sin; but I think that you have the flavor of what the unpardonable sin is - wanting to be saved 'our own way' - exactly right.     TL;DR Those who are truly Christian cannot commit the unpardonable sin. The unpardonable sin is committed every day, by many people; you don't need to die in defiance to do it. To commit the unpardonable sin you must have already made it impossible in-your-own-heart for God to be right about the requirements for salvation; i.e. you must be wholly unwilling to receive salvation through Christ first, before the unpardonable sin can be committed. Since that mental component is required, and it is technically a state you are in prior-to speaking any blasphemies, then it is also technically true that only those who are unsaved-already can/could commit the unpardonable sin.  EDIT: But those who commit it, obviously, will die in defiance since they are by definition unforgivable, and will therefore never repent. Thus making it a bit of a circle in that only those who would-not-let-themselves-be-saved blaspheme the Holy Spirit, thus making them unable to be saved. Further, obviously not every unbeliever is unwilling to repent and be saved, as all of us were unbelievers at some point in our lives before becoming Christian. But these unbelievers who are not unwilling to be saved, do not have the requisite mental attitude that would cause them to blaspheme the Holy Spirit anyway; thereby never preventing them from theoretically attaining salvation.   TL;DR only those who God will save, will be saved, so everyone should quit worrying about the unpardonable sin."

TrueChristian,3cdts6,borza45,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:33:02 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a discussion on the unpardonable sin that addresses one simple issue. It is this.  Can a person commit this sin, while still living, and have no possibility of forgiveness?   This is the real issue to me. A lot of the time when this issue gets brought up, people make comments like ""it's an unpardonable state"" or ""you have to die in that state."" I feel like these kind of responses don't really get to the heart of the matter. Of course, these answers could be the correct interpretation. But I would like to see the former issue addressed as I feel like it gets glanced over the most.   From my own study, there seems to be more than a few interpretations of this teaching.   The unpardonable sin cannot be committed today.    I think this is the rarest position that I have found. I discovered it because it's a position by Dr. Charles Stanley, a prominent Baptist preacher.   The unpardonable sin is a continual act [state]. Not a one time act or slip of the tongue. One commits this while dying in this state.   Variations of this stance seem to be the most popular explanation. Mark Driscoll explained it in a similar way. Many Christians seem to think it's not a one time sin, at the very least. Even some think that this unpardonable state is changeable if one seeks after God.   The unpardonable sin can be committed in this lifetime, but no one really knows when one has crossed the threshold.   This view rejects the 'unpardonable state' idea, while also accepting it's still not a one time sin. This group would agree with the second group in that regard. However, this position holds that it is possible for people to slip into unpardonable territory. It's still not a one time act. But it can happen from continual rejection of 'light'. An individual could reach a point where they have fallen into a real unpardonable state whereby they have zero chance of forgiveness. This is basically John Piper's view.  I think there are some problems with all of the views.   View 1 sounds the best. But it seems to go against the view that the Bible is written for all time. According to view 1, it was a special circumstance because Jesus was actually there. This was basically Stanley's argument. It was a unique situation because they had witnessed miracles firsthand. But does that mean that the actual text themselves are somewhat less authoritative because Jesus isn't present on earth? The gospels are supposed to be the accounts of Jesus and obviously scripture as well. So it seems like this position could be saying that the gospel accounts aren't as good as having Jesus actually here with us. But if they are true, then that shouldn't matter at all.   View 2 and 3 are basically similar except that view 3 suggests that some people actually reach a point of no return. According to view 2, the unpardonable sin [state] seems to be changeable. Both would agree that the unpardonable sin is not a one time act, at least I think so. I haven't found any Christian commentary that held to such a rigid view."
TrueChristian,3cdts6,stevyjohny,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:52:12 2015 UTC,"I answered your question, in my other post in this thread. Just fyi :)"
TrueChristian,3cdts6,rethcir_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. I read it and i liked it. I appreciated the response directly addressing my question. I still have some concerns. They're not your fault. It's just the nature of the issue I guess.   The analysis was good using the skeptic example of questioning miracles and showing that step 3 would constitute the unpardonable sin. However, I'm not sure that is the best real world application. How many people witness miracles on a daily basis?   I grant that you also mentioned that non believers commit the unpardonable sin because of a hard heart. And that they have to be in a state of rejection first. I think anyone would agree with that. But there are no clear examples of what this looks like. Is it just someone who lives a stubborn life in rebellion of the gospel?  The skeptic analogy was good at pin pointing what the unpardonable sin would look like. But I don't think that actually ever happens. How many skeptics witness a miracle performed by a Christian?  What about televangelists? Peter Popoff was definitely not performing any miracles. He only knew members of the audience because someone was feeding him information through an earpiece."
TrueChristian,3cdts6,stevyjohny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I really tried to get the point across with maximum clarity, which is why I chose the 'clearer' examples that I did.   I totally understand your concerns about this, so I'll try and come up with a more 'real world' example for you.    How many people witness miracles on a daily basis?   First, it could be argued that since salvation is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, each saved person is a miracle; and anyone who witnesses the moment would be therefore witnessing a miracle.   However, that is also thin & unhelpful so I'll go to a more perceptible, and realistic example.     So lets talk about the unpardonable sin in a way that doesn't involve actual miracles.   Mark 3 (the other unpardonable sin chapter) & Matthew 12, obviously both concern the pharisees' reaction toward Jesus when he was casting out demons & healing the sick. So contextually, as we talked about at length in my other post, miracles are a definite sensitive zone to have the opportunity to commit the unpardonable sin.   Yet, it is reasonably fair, from the language Jesus uses regarding ""satan casting out satan"" (Mark 3:23), it is super simple to extrapolate that it is by the ""power of the Holy Spirit"" that Jesus cast out demons.   Which gives us a slightly fuzzier, but still pretty understandable, new category of potential case-scenarios.   So - theoretically - any time the Holy Spirit does something (directly) or indirectly, calling that power something else would be proportionally equivalent to what the pharisees did when faced with direct miracles.   So to craft an example; I just want to stipulate something that is clearly ""the work of the Holy Spirit"". Let's stipulate that Sam Childers went to Africa and saved hundreds of children by the ""will of"" the Holy Spirit. It may not be the case - I think it really is though - but for this example lets just assume that what Childers did was a direct work of the Holy Spirit in his life.   Certainly nothing Childers did in a 'practical' sense was miraculous. Yet, his very presence in Africa, saving children, is a direct work of the Holy Spirit.   So then lets run through the 3 cases we discussed previously with Mr. Childers in mind.    1) A Christian learns of Mr. Childers life, and acknowledges that he 'was lead' by the Holy Spirit to do such things.  2) A Skeptic learns of Mr. Childers life, and is unsure what precisely to say was the cause of Childers radical life transformation. He is unsure, and so doesn't say one way or the other. No blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.  3) A person-in-rejection learns of Mr. Childers life, and thinks that Mr. Childers has only made the changes in his life because A) he felt guilty over his past, or ; B) he just made those life changes for selfish reasons, or ; C) his life changes were the result of Satan/Zeus/Thor/Vishnu and certainly not Jesus!    In case 3, the person-in-rejection, (remember this person has a vested interest in denying even the possibility of the Holy Spirit) could be so moved by their hardened heart to speak out and say aloud ""Childers is only doing what he's doing for reason X which is certainly not the Holy Spirit!""   This would be ... very very close to blaspheming the Holy Spirit ... if not actually fully committing it. I'd personally be prepared to say that they've blasphemed the Holy Spirit in case 3 if they said something like that aloud.   I think this is a much more modern example of what blasphemy of the Holy Spirit looks like.   Again, as I've said in the previous post, it is clear from the context in Matthew 12 & Mark 3, that a rejection-state-of-mind is a prerequisite to being able to commit the unpardonable sin at all.   Obviously, even if someone were to completely fulfill a case-3 type of scenario, I would still be uncomfortable declaring them as having committed the U-Sin; even if I might think that they have done it. As it would be a very very serious thing to try and say for certain that someone is now beyond all redemption.   Still I do certainly think that many many case-3 type scenarios happen in this day & age, and therefore many many people have placed themselves beyond redemption by their hardened hearts.   Just like Romans 1 talks about.     Is this a more realistic / modern example for you?"
TrueChristian,3cdts6,rethcir_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:31:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think so.   But it still seems like a very specific example. If that is what the unpardonable sin really is, then I don't think anyone has anything to worry about. Because that is still such a very limited, specific situation that just won't happen that often.   Usually, my understanding of the unpardonable sin is a lot more broad. Yours seems to narrow it down to this specific modern day equivalent of the events that happened in the new testament, whereby someone is denying some specific work of the Holy Spirit.   My understanding has always been that the unpardonable sin is just kind of a hardness of heart that eventually results in final rejection of Christ. So it's a lot more ambiguous. Maybe you would also agree with that? If I understand you correctly, you were just using those examples to show an actual situation whereby the unpardonable sin could be committed. Maybe it was my fault for focusing too much on that.  For the sake of argument, I would also add that I'm not sure if I'm 100% behind your Childers example.   Certainly, anyone could claim that they are doing something good for divine reasons. However, it still seems possible to me that someone could also be doing it for their own purposes.   I was considering doing a mission trip last year. A lot of people encouraged me to do it. Part of me wanted to do something for God in a sense. But I would admit that there was some part of me that also just wanted the adventure of going to another country. I'm not sure that I could say my ambitions were 100% pure. I thought it would be more interesting to travel than work a regular job for 6 months. I didn't go on the trip, but that's beside the point."
TrueChristian,3cdts6,stevyjohny,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:15:49 2015 UTC,"For the sake of argument, I would also add that I'm not sure if I'm 100% behind your Childers example.    Sure, that's fine you don't have to be 100% sure - but notice how you aren't saying ""oh but it definitely wasn't the Holy Spirit"". Ergo, you can presumably envision a situation where someone does say that it wasn't 100% the holy spirit, and thereby commits the unpardonable sin - in the strictest sense (i.e. case 3)    My understanding has always been that the unpardonable sin is just kind of a hardness of heart that eventually results in final rejection of Christ.   Yes that has always been my understanding of it as well; until like I mentioned in my first post I've been counseling a sister-in-Christ about the issue; so I've had to really really look into it.   Also, ultimately, the U-sin is a hard heart issue, since as Jesus notes in Matt 12 / Mark 3 that the pharisees had to have a certain kind of thought-process prior to their speaking any blasphemies.    [I] don't think anyone has anything to worry about.   Well... I agree that true-christians don't have anything to worry about re: the U-sin. Since we can safely extrapolate from Jesus words that a ""house divided against itself cannot stand"" & therefore that the Holy Spirit cannot/would-not blaspheme himself. Since the Holy Spirit indwells each Christian, it stands to Jesus's reasoning that Christians cannot commit the U-sin.   Which theologically just makes sense ... I mean why else would God elect people who are just going to render themselves unforgivable? It wouldn't make any sense for Christians to be able to commit the U-sin.    Because that is still such a very limited, specific situation that just won't happen that often.    Unless each instance of salvation counts as a work of the Holy Spirit & therefore is a miracle & therefore anyone who says/thinks that ""so & so isn't really saved... cuz God doesn't exist"" is committing the unpardonable sin.   Which I totally subscribe to.   But that's just a theory - a theology theory; thanks for reading."
TrueChristian,3cdts6,rethcir_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:37:45 2015 UTC,"Many christians teach that the unforgivable sin is when you sin willfully after having received knowledge of the truth (remember Peter?). So what happens if you are like most christians: Forgiven, but still with an inclination to evil? Answer: Said person will feel pretty heavy guilt for willful sin, and purpose in his heart to never do it again. For example, a person who believes that he must overcome lust NOW might do so by castration. A person who believes that he must overcome rudeness NOW might relocate to a deserted island and burn whatever vehicle got him there.   I wonder though, whether this conflicts with Mark 9:43 and Matthew 5:29-30. They're the verses about ""cutting your arm off if it causes you to sin"". Now, I understand it's not usually interpreted literally; but even if not, it's about sacrifice and taking strong/harsh measures in order to avoid sinning. If I'm interpreting this wrong, do correct me please."
TrueChristian,3cdts6,LjudLjus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:48:45 2015 UTC,I have long wondered that too. But like you I believe that it is not meant to be taken literally. I think that verse has more to do with getting rid of bad acquaintances and situations that would cause you to stumble.
TrueChristian,3cdts6,johansense1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"I am strongly of the mind that intentionally speaking against the Holy Spirit is blasphemy, as the example suggests with the religious rulers and Jesus  I do not believe that false prophecy is blasphemy, if the person is deceived. it must be intentional.   I also believe this is true ""who is man to know who is speaking to him?"" so i'm really not offended if someone is wrong, and its very interesting when later they correct themselves.  As many seem to testify, what happened after i ""got saved"" -the devil started shouting blasphemies against the Holy Spirit in my ear. it took some time to get rid of all those voices, and it didn't seem like sin was overcome, but rather i became stronger internally. i may have had a thorn in the flesh, a messanger from satan for 6 months too.. i'd rather not have one of them again, and yes they spend most of their time telling you to blaspheme God and kill yourself..   I have two friends of mine who confessed to blaspheming the Holy Spirit and I think one of them is deceived. but I still took it as a pretty serious warning at the time because sometimes I wonder just how close I am myself.  anyhow one of those guys is deceived, i am certain of it, because it is pretty obvious to me that i've asked him prophetic questions and seen the conviction produced in him. but there could be other reasons why God has allowed those things to happen.  As for the other, its like there's this firewall between me and him, and I haven't sensed any opportunity since then to discuss spiritual matters with him on a personal level. honestly I wonder if he will be a threat to me after times get tough.. you know when the dollar hyperinflates itself soon.  so i've also come to a temporary conclusion that 1 John 5:16 should say ""i do not ask that you pray for them"" referring to them that have committed unforgivable sins."

TrueChristian,3c9lgk,db_pen,5,Mon Jul 6 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"There is a lack of the ""goo goo ga ga"" passion that is found in an outside-of-Christ relationship. Fulfillment isn't found in a relationship like it was when I wasn't a Christian, wild, uncontrollable lust. The relationship seems much more grounded with purpose, self-control, honor, and they are much more like a ""co-servant"" for Christ, and a best friend, than... you know, what you see in the movies.   For my wife and I, it was a mix of this. There was a lot of that new-love feeling while we were dating, probably too much of it, but at the same time we knew the relationship wasn't just about us.   I am drawn to be closer to God because of reason 1. Because I realize only God can really fulfill me, as it cannot be found in things that I used to find fulfillment in prior to knowing Christ (girlfriends being one of them for me). I am also drawn to be in prayer about the relationship so that it is made clear if we are to end up in marriage.   I spent years idolizing relationships and thinking that getting a girlfriend would solve all of my problems. Then I got into a short, bad relationship. God finally gave me what I'd wanted for so long, and it wasn't at all what I thought it'd be. Then I started dating my now-wife, and God started to show me that no, this relationship wasn't going to solve all of my problems, but it was unquestionably still a good thing when focused on Him.   Since becoming a Christian, it's been like an ""off switch"" when it comes to sexual desires. You just turn it off--at least I did to honor my sisters and please the Lord.    I'm glad you have that ""off switch."" My wife and I certainly didn't! Maintaining our physical boundaries was a struggle for us until the day we got married.    So what happens IF things pan out and you get married? Do you just like, flick on the switch when it is okay to enter sexual relations with your wife? I am so used to just keeping it ""off"" and focusing on God, it's such a strange thought to finally be okay to have sex in marriage.   Don't worry, you'll be fine. In all honesty, it took us a while to work through the change when we were first married. I'm glad that, even though we pushed the kissing a bit too far, we didn't end up having sex before we were married. That would have made the adjustment period after marriage quite a bit longer for us. (Not because premarital sex is an insurmountable obstacle, but because we were both believers and knew what we were doing was wrong. That would have been far hard to work through if we'd gone farther down that road of sin.) Keep honoring this woman as a sister in Christ and the rest will follow.   I haven't jumped ""all in"" with her. My goal is to honor her above all else while in courtship/dating (whatever you want to label it, I am not a labeling type myself), and growing closer together to God and figuring out if it is God's will, that I feel like I have built up ""walls"". Because I believe a lot of what you share emotionally with a woman, is specifically designed for your wife, and it is NOT okay to cross these barriers while outside of marriage.   You're right here. There is a certain intimacy that belongs only in marriage, and you're doing well to keep that in mind. Just be careful that those walls start to truly come down if you marry this woman. We're called to love our wives as Christ loved the church. So by all means, don't go ""all in"" yet, but be prepared to do so the minute you get married.   I also come to realization, that as Paul wrote, it really is easier to please God while ""single"", than in marriage. I'm not married, but as things move in that direction, it is made very clear to me that it is so much easier to run around on missions, and focusing on His Kingdom while single. Because of this, while I am in the ""courting"" process, I am more urgent on doing missions and dedicating my time to God (sharing the Gospel). There is A LOT of sacrifices to be made in marriage, and it is not the soaring, mythical feeling that is displayed all over our culture/media. It really is a commitment, a decision, to stick around through thick and thin and glorify God, and pleasing God will be much more difficult as men, when we now have additional responsibilities   Paul definitely had a point. Yes, marriage is a sacrifice of time and priorities, don't get me wrong on that. It will absolutely reduce your ability to just pick up and change situations, like Paul is talking about. But at the same time, don't fall into the world's view of marriage somehow being a trap you'll never escape from. With all of that additional responsibility you mentioned comes great joy, and the support of another Christ-follower for your every endeavor."
TrueChristian,3c9lgk,archonaran,3,Mon Jul 6 13:30:48 2015 UTC,"i highly recommend a book i am reading right now by matt chandler called ""the mingling of souls"". it addresses ALL this. its biblical and atypical. i like it a lot."
TrueChristian,3c9lgk,StevenDavisPhoto,3,Mon Jul 6 07:24:36 2015 UTC,"One   My wife and I experienced that ""goo goo ga ga"" passion during our dating life and it lasted until about our second year of marriage, when we really started to get grounded in reality.  As a divorce attorney, I can say that this usually ends for people sometime between 6 months and 3 years after marriage.  If you aren't experiencing this with a person at all to begin with, I would be slightly concerned about why you're with the person.   Two   I have shared this exact experience.   Three   I know exactly what you're talking about.  The answer (at least for me) is a resounding: NO!  The switch does not automatically come back on for either of you.  Before we were married, we had many moments where we were very passionate, almost pushing lines, and eventually set up firmer boundaries, just to be safe.  That meant turning off my sex drive for a while, just like you described.  My wife did the same.  Now, neither of us can seem to get it back on.  Instead, I had times early in our marriage where I still fell into pornogaraphy - not because I was disappointed at her sex drive and felt I needed more; rather, it was out of habit.  So, be careful there.   Four   I agree that there are some things that are not okay to share outside of marriage, such as lust, sex, etc.  That said, I would be very open and honest about your entire life and not hide anything at all.  My wife did this to me and it really ruined us for a long time and we're still recovering.  Specifically, she did like you said and put up a ""wall,"" saying that it was to seek God and not just me - and that God was always her highest priority, and she genuinely believed this.  Then, after we were married, she confessed that she didn't really seek God during that time, she only intended to ... any seeking was minimal and only in the form of short quiet times or journaling here and there.  Instead, after we were married she revealed that she was not passionate about missions and had never had a ""God-experience"" and that she really despised the part about me that loves to study the Bible and teach and make disciples - all things which she said she loved about me while we were dating.  I felt very duped, as this is something that could have been avoided if she had been very honest with me.  That said, she confused the idea of putting up a wall (""guard your heart"" and ""do not arouse love before it so desires"") as something good and godly with her actual use of the wall - to hide behind it so that the relationship wouldn't crumble if I knew the truth.  In year 5 of our marriage she finally verbalized this and admitted that she had lied to me about who she was during our relationship because she ""knew you were the kind of person a good Christian girl should want to marry, and I thought it would be sinful for me to pass that up.""  To her credit, if I knew the truth about her views on God and ministry and her lack of interest in missions, I would not have married her.  All I ever received during the pre-marriage relationship was affirmation that she wanted to have an open home to house small groups and people in need.  Now, 7 years into marriage, she's still touting threats against me about what she'll do if I offer to host our church small group at our house (which was a problem this morning).  The only times she's happy with me are when I'm making money for her to spend or fixing things around the house :/  In short, DO NOT PUT UP INFORMATIONAL WALLS.  This is a terrible idea.  Not just from my own story, but from countless others who I have mentored over the years, I can affirm definitively that it is always best to make sure your spouse knows everything about you before you get married.  Can you put up an emotional wall so that you don't become too attached to the point that a break-up would devastate you?  Sure, I suppose you can.  But I don't think you need to.  I think a proper dependence on God and reliance on the Gospel for your ultimate source of satisfaction in life should be more than adequate to give the same effect without creating a wall.  Like with the physical issue, creating an emotional wall can run the risk that you won't be able to tear it down in the marriage, unless your dating life is incredibly short.  We dated for 3 years before marriage and that was a long time to develop habits and relational patterns that were incredibly difficult to break after marriage.   Five   Although I didn't address the issue directly, I'm sure you can imagine, based on my story, that missions all but crumbled for me after I married my wife.  It took me about 4 years to develop my wife's perseverance and tolerance in my drive and calling for missions before I could actively start living out my calling to some degree.  Even still, there are extreme limiters in place.  For example, I'm not allowed to meet any of the men I disciple until after the kids go to bed (at 8:30).  This means I end up having to take time off work mid-day each week to meet guys, since most guys aren't willing to meet up after 9 when they have jobs of their own.  There are lots of other bars and hindrances.  Accordingly, I always counsel younger men: If you are not passionate about someone to the point of risking sexual immorality, remain single.  I have found great wisdom not only in Paul's words in 1 Cor. 7, but also in Jesus words after the disciples exclaim that it's better not to marry: ""Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given ... The one who can accept this should accept it"" (Matthew 19:10-12).  In light of these two passages, I do not believe that a general struggle with lust is sufficient to demand that a single person get married.  Instead, I see that Paul only references two people together who are burning with passion.  So, someone who is addicted to pornography or pre-marital sex should not be thinking, ""That must mean God wants me to get married - to have an outlet for my lust.""  This is very dangerous thinking.  Specifically, from my experience, as well as that of virtually every other guy I have ever known, marriage did not solve the pornography addiction.  If anything, it made it worse because they now no longer have the hope of sex within marriage as something to look forward to, which would help them hold back while still single.  They see that sex within marriage has been tainted by the fall, just like everything else, and thus expectations (even those who think they already lowered their expectations) are disappointed, and this leads back to the addiction.  Instead, the real issue is self-control.  Saying wedding vows doesn't magically bestow you with an extra dose of self-control.  So, I wouldn't ever recommend a guy get married until after he has completely solved his lust problem (not to impute this on you, as I don't know whether or not you struggle with it - I only know that it is common enough that it is worth mentioning in the context of your fifth point here).  If you have not solved your lust problem and you're burning with passion for someone you're dating, you should break up and not date anyone else until the lust issue is conquered (and yes, it can be conquered!)  If you have already conquered individual lust and have then started dating someone and find lust re-awoken in you, that's when you need to get married.  Too many Christian men end up in ruined marriages because they thought their struggle with pornography meant God wanted them to get married."

TrueChristian,3c9lgk,drac07,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the wisdom and insight. Well, I guess I should clarify.  There are definitely moments where I am absolutely infatuated with getting to know her and love spending time with her as a sister and potential wife. There is also something I've never experienced before, peace. Peace knowing we both share the same love for the same God, and the obedience to God that follows. It isn't ""wreckless"" as our culture/Hollywood has defined things.  But I would not classify that as ""goo goo ga ga"". I remember as a teenager or young 20's and not following Christ, it didn't matter who they were, I could day-dream and fantasize about girls all day long. They were short bursts of passion coming from my own selfish desires.  Now do I find this woman beautiful? You bet! Am I terrified? You bet again! Haha. With no idea if we are compatible physically (we don't even kiss), I am very scared of the unknown! I am also very scared if I will ever be the man God has planned for me, as she is about 5 years older than me. There is also a much faster ""pace"" that comes with that age difference, and where we both are in life (older and more settled). But without giving into these ""selfish desires"" that we men have, or exploring it, it's hard to say ""the passionate floodgates have opened"" for me.

TrueChristian,3c91is,onemanandhishat,4,Mon Jul 6 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"My church has a pastor who does this actually. He works full time as a pharmacist but preaches a smaller Sunday evening service most weeks as a volunteer (with his pastors license). In some ways, it's really not so different from people who volunteer every week to help with sound, greeting, ushers, and whatever else churches need weekly volunteers for.  However, Idk if you'd see as many full time pastors without pay as a full time pastor requires much more than just Sunday morning services and wouldn't leave much time for another job. Of course, this does vary from church to church and by size."

TrueChristian,3c91is,jsh1138,3,Mon Jul 6 05:24:49 2015 UTC,"you would have to work and earn a living   I don't think you understand how much work pastors do. Most of the advice given to people looking to go into ministry is ""if you can do anything else at all, do that instead, only go into ministry if you can't be content doing anything else"". The reason is its hard, your are effectivly writting a new thesis paper every week (sometimes 2-3 depending on how often they preach). Then they have to deal with people, and people arn't exactly easy to deal with. Plus they have to manage the building, pay the bills, and all the accounting stuff as well. Or if the church is bigger manage the people who do it. Its not an easy job, and Ive heard many preachers express that if it wasn't for gods calling they would be out of there FAST because ultimately preaching and leading a church tends to be a whole lot of work for very little pay."
TrueChristian,3c91is,jsh1138,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:58:10 2015 UTC,"yes I know they do a lot of work, I have a pastor myself.

Most of the people I know who are in that line of work do it because they feel called to it, and the pay often isn't very good. Would they do it for no pay? Yes - they'd do what many people who aren't the full-time pastor of churches do, and commit their spare time.  However, I don't think we should expect them to. It is work, and should be paid for. Given how important it is, it should have appropriate remuneration. I don't believe there is something inherently holy about living in poverty - it invites its own sins (See Proverbs 30:7-9). In rural England there are plenty of very small churches which provide inadequate financial support (my old pastor's wife worked which helped support them), and small congregations. There's often little glory and they serve faithfully because it is what they believe they should do."

TrueChristian,3c91is,gage_deity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:02:00 2015 UTC,"To reply specifically to this question: yes it happens. Going with no support is not necessarily wise. Even if your church cannot financially support you, you need support in prayer, it is a difficult task that should not be done alone.  These countries are what mission organisations call 'creative access' nations - countries where preaching is not a legitimate occupation, so you must have legitimate work that allows you to stay in the country. You then go about making disciples through the people you meet. It is difficult work, but there are plenty who do it. Many churches have no church building to meet in, for example the house churches in China, which have to meet on the quiet. Even in open western countries, a lot of churches have no premises.  I'd even suggest that the experience of the majority of pastors is not to be wealthy or have much glory. There are some who gain fame, and megachurches who pay handsomely, but I don't think this is the case in the majority of churches around the world, as many congregations can't afford to pay their pastor that well."
TrueChristian,3c91is,lju1977,3,Mon Jul 6 05:37:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. Why? me.  I'm 22, I suffer with a lot of health problems,and though I have struggled with god a lot I've been saved since I was a kid (though I almost walked away at one point, it was bad).  Now God has turned my life around and called me into the ministry. Before he ever called me into the ministry I got on my knees one day (literally) and completly and wholy gave myself to him, no strings. I said whatever he wanted with me, he can have, I'm his. Honestly, I half  expected him to kill me on the spot for some things Ive done, but he didn't. When he called me to ministry, it was the LAST THING I WANTED, in fact I kinda have always kinda judged people in ministry who were my age and headed that way. Like ""get a job, figure out what the real world is like, you probably just think ministry is easy"", I thought they were naive and sheltered. Now some of them were don't get me wrong, but not all of them.   When I gave myself to god, that meant in everything, so if he called me to ministry, no matter how much I don't want to go into it, I will. Now he changed my heart over time , so I DO want to go to ministry, but it was never my base desire and part of me still wants to cut and run, but I wont. In fact most of the ministeres Ive talked to that are solid and I respect flat out have told me the last thing they ever wanted was to be a minister. Its not an easy job, and its not a career, but their entire life.   I'll follow god even if he never heals me of my health problems, I'll follow him if I starve (and I have starved), I'll follow him if I'm beaten or thrown in jail or killed. Because I'm nothing without him. Nothing at all, there is no purpose to my life outside of him, I was made to follow him. I would be lying if I said I didn't hope that in the end up with a decent income from it, but thats not the motivating factor. If I go into this thing and don't make a DIME I'm ok. My understanding is most small churches start with the minister paying a lot out of pocket because the congregation is small. Someone has to pay the light and utilities.   Because of my limitations, most of the interaction I have with people is online, I get no recognition or meaningful praise from people because none of them know me. But I get it from God, and thats all th recognition I need.  Would some pastors stop without that stuff? Of course, half the people that call themselves pastors now in days arn't even christian by biblical standards. They would dart fast when they was no profit in it, but that doesn't mean all are."

TrueChristian,3c8pix,rettgoat,7,Sun Jul 5 23:11:57 2015 UTC,"One of the most important things is soundness of teaching according to scripture (and that scripture is being taught and explained)... but you also need a church that is encouraging you, not discouraging you: Hebrews 10:24-25     And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.       From a protestant/evangelical/non-denominational background I can tell you that many churches that do well to stick to scripture can also be legalistic about it and cause it to be a burden which it should not be.  That said I totally recommend protestant/evangelical churches, just find one that is not harsh, burdensome, and discouraging in their teachings (keeping also in mind that some things in scripture may, without proper understanding, appear burdensome or discouraging, even harsh)  To clarify for some of my brothers and sisters who may question my viewpoint, I'm not suggesting to appeal to your sinful nature.  Those who love the things of this world may be discouraged and think it's burdensome or harsh to let go of those things (such as wild parties or sexual immorality or harsh language, even pride and other sins of the heart).  I'm NOT talking about that kind of discouragement.  For with God letting go of all those things are ultimately not a loss, and with proper understanding of the cross, Jesus provides a way for letting go of those things to be freeing and for us to do good works which have eternal rewards waiting for us--leading us by a law of grace that brings freedom (therefore encouraging us): James 1:25     But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.

I don't really know enough about anything to have an opinion on it so please don't take that as judgement from me personally.    It makes me wary though.

We all start off as babes in Christ, how do we know if someone is pulling wool over our eyes, or more likely, how do we know the pastor is not going down the wrong path and deceiving himself too, or just plain mistaken in his teachings.    Well Jesus addresses this by talking about the fruit of a person's life. Matthew 7:15-20 shows that when someone gets scripture wrong, it manifest in their actions.  In other words, if you're hearing sermons or homilies that sound great, but the teacher himself shows in his life that he is a violent tempered man, or is known for being hard on his wife and kids, or is known for being two-faced or dishonest, or any other like-mannered problem, it should raise major red flags about the sermons your hearing.  That's because the teaching in scripture is not just nice words to please our ears... it's life changing stuff!    Hebrews 4:12     For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart."

It isn't possible to believe/practice it in the light of the truth of Catholicism.   A religion's adherent stating the teaching of the religion, that it's the true religion, cannot honestly be considered disrespectful. This is a core belief of many religions. It could only be claimed disrespectful if someone were looking for an excuse to be offended. But they would likely be offended by many claims Christianity makes. They would likely also be offended by secular facts like crime statistics. Whatever the implications of factual statements are, the statements themselves are not disrespectful.  What is disrespectful is the ban. It disrespects the commenter and mocks logic. This action is telling followers of Christianity not to explain a religious doctrine that's existed since the beginning of their religion. How is that logical in a Christian forum?

Matthew 5:17 Christ says ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.""  It means we were never able to keep the law, or Mosaic covenant, which is what the Jews went by. We are broken and sinful. That is why God created a new covenant with us, Christ as our intercessor, and high priests (book of Hebrews). Jesus fulfilled the law.   This is the bigger picture, and why Christ is our savior."

Do you know what the definition of sin is? It is not ""bad"". It is an transgression against the Lord.  It is HIS definition of what is considered a transgression - an act of unholiness.  Homosexuality and incest is just a small picture of what sin really is - which is going against God. People can sin against God by choosing something else over God or thinking they don't need him. IMHO that is the scariest sin."

That's about as obvious as it gets, and coming straight from Jesus as interpreted by Mark/Peter in its appropriate context of food and not some other metaphoric way.

TrueChristian,3c6kjo,ruizbujc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Ugh, but that's the NIV translation. A modern translation. No translation after 1950 or so is good, because they put that line in there. Jesus never ""declared all foods clean"". I prefer my Bibles to be as literal as possible. Like I said, in Mark 7 and Matthew 15, the Pharisees are trying to get Jesus in trouble for breaking the law. He can't break the law right in front of them! So obviously this translation does not work, especially considering he criticizes the Pharisees that their tradition interferes with the commandments of God.  tl;dr Please refer to the KJV, the Latin Vulgate, the original Greek, or pretty much any translation that isn't ""modern""."
TrueChristian,3c6kjo,Studieren123,3,Mon Jul 6 23:44:05 2015 UTC,"This seems to be a very disrespectful view to the many godly people far more wise and intelligent than we are who have held this view and have been responsible for translating the scriptures - particularly when Paul specifically says in Romans 14 that those who hold such a view are immature.  I've been to a service before where the pastor asked for a volunteer to bring an NIV Bible to the podium.  Without warning, the pastor shouted that ""this Bible is from the devil!"" and proceeded to rip it apart and throw it down the aisle.  I'm not trying to say you're like him, but that type of behavior is disgusting and abhorrent to the Lord - so be cautious not to go down that path with false feelings of superiority."
TrueChristian,3c6kjo,ruizbujc,0,Tue Jul 7 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not a KJV-onlyist. I simply detest incorrect verses like the NIV has for Mark 7:19. The ESV and NASB also are all incorrect. All modern versions are incorrect, because of this verse alone. Why is it that a modern version somehow necessitates this verse to be incorrect? Now, they might be good in the other verses, but this single verse is worth a lot of weight to me. People shouldn't add their theology into the translation, but should translate it as it is."
TrueChristian,3c6kjo,Studieren123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:37:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention.  On researching it further, I'm seeing the consistency in what you're saying as to this particular verse.  That said, I am not yet persuaded that the ""modern"" constructions of this passage are an incorrect interpretation of the meaning of these words.  In doing a lot of research on this over the past couple days, this guy seems to have summarized the conflict the most succinctly (just using him for summary purposes, not to say that he is an authority; rather, the authoritative sources are accurately reflected in his post).  To be clear, I now understand that your interpretation of Mark 7:19 is a perfectly legitimate and valid one and that the NIV and other modern translations are adding words that aren't there - a practice which every English translation does, including the KJV.  Even if I were to be fully persuaded as to your understanding of the proper translation of Mark 7:19 (and I actually am now inclined to agree with you), I am still not persuaded yet that the rules about clean and unclean foods were meant for non-Jews (I'm not aware of any Jewish blood in me), or that the greater context of the Mark 7 passage (and others) still demands a prohibition of certain foods (or otherwise deems their consumption sinful).  Specifically, I see time and again that Jesus and the apostles reference the workings of heart/mind/spirit as the ultimate source of sin and that tangible/worldly things are merely representative of what's occurring on a spiritual level.  A good example of this is Romans 9, essentially saying, ""God's people aren't about a bloodline, but about a promise/covenant.""  Jesus also delves into this a lot in Matthew 5.  Accordingly, the new testament describes the ""new covenant"" as being the same as the ""old covenant,"" except applying as to the spirit and not the world.  If this understanding is true, then under the new covenant we are no longer bound by physical circumstances, as we have the more stringent requirements of our heart.  This is why we are no longer under the law, but under grace.  Per Matthew 5, the real problem in murder is the hatred in one's heart, or the real problem in adultery is the lust in one's heart, etc.  But, as Jesus says in Mark 7, food is just food - it comes in and goes out.  I get that the subject matter is the washing of hands, but you can't ignore Jesus dicta and say he was right as to the content, but wrong as to the implications.  When verse 18 says ""nothing,"" he doesn't follow that with ""except unclean foods.""  I appreciate your helping me to understand this concept better.  I'm going to continue researching it.  If you have any more insights to help guide me, I'd be very appreciative :)  Also, because I don't see eye-to-eye with many of the resources that support your conclusion, if you do provide anything, do I have the freedom to ask how you would respond to specific critiques?"
TrueChristian,3c6kjo,ruizbujc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:34:35 2015 UTC,"I don't speak Greek, but if you look at the dictionaries, καθαριζων can mean purging or cleaning or purifying. To me, it makes infinitely more sense that Jesus is saying that a dirty food gets cleaned from your body, or purged from your body. It seems far less likely that the author was saying Jesus himself cleaned all the foods. It's contradictory to the rest of the chapter in which Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for breaking the law of Moses due to their traditions.  That being said, yes, I agree 100% that Jesus is saying the real problem is of the heart, not the food."

Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”  But Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.” And he said, “Are you also still without understanding?  Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled?

The law that applied only to the Nation of Israel. The Nation of Israel ceased a long time ago. The moral law. This covers things like the 10 Commandments. This law still applies.

I do however think it is a guideline given to us on how to eat and live healthy. Just as we would tell children, don't eat cookies and ice cream all day, not because we want them to get in trouble but because it would make them feel bad. It is not good for the body to consume those things. I believe there are laws in the Bible and there are guidelines.

There is no prayer that will bring you to the promise land, I'm not saying you think this way..but there are people that are currently living on this planet that believe they will get saved because of a salvation prayer they did a couple of years ago...and continue to live life on their own terms. It's people like those that Jesus Christ will say to ""depart from me i never knew you"". If you're ever worried that what you're doing isn't enough i want you to do this for me. I want you to wait for a day in which you are completely alone and take your bible out. I want you to repent of all of your sins and confess any deeps sins with your tongue that you have a troubled time talking about, then i want you to ask the Lord to come spend some 1 on 1 time with you. Ask him to speak to you through his word, and spend some time voicing your concerns to him. I guarantee you that this will do more for you than anything else you could ever do, he wants us to build a strong relationship with him, trust me when i say that he will answer all of your requests. Remember at the end of the day it's not our works that save us, it's not the fact that we went to church, it's not even that we read the bible...it's that we have an actual intimate relationship with Jesus Christ. From what you've said it's very clear that you seek to please him, he cherises what is in the depths of our hearts. From the looks of things it seems like you're on the right path. There is one thing I'd like to share with you, make sure you always ask to be cleansed in his blood and repent. There are many barriers that keep our prayers from reaching heaven at times. By cleansing ourselves before the father, we can be assured that he will hear them out. But yes, trusting in what he did will not only get you saved, but it will ensure you have every single victory here on planet earth!"

It means believing that God is your loving heavenly Father and that Christ is your Savior, that you have forgiveness of sins in Him, even now before you have satisfied yourself that you have everything figured out."
TrueChristian,3c4lhc,CSTDude777,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"Of course that's correct! Jesus states that those that believe in Him has eternal life. Ephesians 2:8-9 state that salvation is by faith alone, not of works, so no man should boast. That ONE verse alone should refute lordship salvation, but there are numerous other verses stating that salvation is simply by faith alone. The entire book of John is about salvation alone. Does it one time mention that you have to give up your sins to be saved? Nope. Other verses from other books may use the word ""repent"" and people will be like, ""See? See!?!? You have to give up your sins!!!"" Actually, no. When talking in light of salvation, repent of your sins is never mentioned. Just the word repent alone. And repent simply means a change of mind. The book of Acts says ""repent, and believe in the gospel and you should be saved"" (paraphrased) So that means change your mind, and believe in the gospel. Not quit drinking, quit smoking, stop cussing, stop having bad thoughts, stop lusting, be a slave to the law, and you will be saved. The Galatians fell from grace for this exact reason. They mixed the law in with the grace from God believing that'll get them saved. So yes, trusting in Jesus alone is what gets you saved, period. No ""and's, if's, or but's""  TL;DR: Yes"
TrueChristian,3c4lhc,deadby100cuts,2,Sat Jul 4 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"salvation is by faith alone, not of works, so no man should boast.    Faith save us, but faith without works is dead.  Works do not save us, but those who are saved will have some works, as they are an outflowing of that faith. Faith causes us to change our lives, to live difrently, to seek god. Faith saves us, and works are the fruit of that faith.  Ive heard it taught so many ways wrong. Faith+works= salvation, works=salvatoin, faith=salvation without works, ect. These are wrong. Rather its faith leads to salvation which causes works. Faith without works is dead, and dead faith doesn't save. Works are a side effect of faith."
TrueChristian,3c4lhc,JesusLovesMeForReals,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"But when you put it like this, faith is reliant on works. Without works, faith doesn't save.... so faith + works save.  But James examples of works are not works of the law, nor are they abstaining from sin (which we should do), nor are they particularly good works. They are ""works"" done which demonstrate faith in God. How many works of Rahab does James give as examples.. one! And the only work given was sedition, in which Rahab saved herself and her family and left the rest of the city to die without warning. Hardly a ""good"" work. But she trusted God would save her. That is the ""work"" there.   What about Abraham? His work was to kill his son. He had faith that God would provide the sacrifice (he says it before he went up - God will provide himself a sacrifice - prophetic probably), or at least raise Isaac from the dead. Either way, he trusted God because God had promised him a great nation through Isaac.   Neither of those are what we would consider ""works"" today.   And what is the final example James gives? A man comes into the assembly hungry. How will faith save him (the poor man). No, he needs food - give him food, and demonstrate your faith by your works. This is consistent with James heart for the poor (which he speaks of several times, and Paul mentions it as well)."

You said it is. You said faith without works is not faith. So the works prove the faith. So in order to have faith, you have to have works. So faith + works save. If you are going to use James 2 the way you are using it, it is the only logical conclusion. Ask any Roman Catholic.  Now, before you get me wrong and think I am saying ""sin all you want"" or ""works are not to be desired"". I'm not. I'm just stating that salvation is by faith alone. Works will inevitably follow. And if they don't, the solution is not to threaten people by saying ""your faith isn't real because you have no works"", but to point them to the one work that matters - the work of Christ, and let that work change them (and us).   Also, it isn't up to us to judge others works, because they probably don't look anything like we are expecting to see (ie, take Rahab and Abraham as examples)."

TrueChristian,3c4lhc,CSTDude777,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"That's the most common thing I hear from lordship salvationists (not calling you one or anything). They always tell me that salvation by faith alone is a ""license to sin."" However, numerous scriptures, including the one in the book of James saying faith without works is dead, state that true saving faith will ALWAYS produce good works, because the Holy Spirit is in you producing good fruit. Anyone who claims to be a Christian and yet still lives a life dominated by sin, I always question if they're really saved. But of course, it's not my job to figure out if they're saved or not, that's completely up to God. My job is to spread the gospel and try to convert people, not to dictate whether they're saved or not."
TrueChristian,3c4lhc,CowboyBigBoss,3,Sun Jul 5 07:07:25 2015 UTC,"That ONE verse alone should refute lordship salvation   http://www.gotquestions.org/lordship-salvation.html  Also, what of those to whom Jesus said ""Depart from Me; I never knew you""? They certainly had faith."
TrueChristian,3c4lhc,1000104859094,2,Sat Jul 4 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"Those people certainly had many wonderful works along with what you say is faith, so it's clearly not a case of people relying on their faith only. To me, it was an obvious warning against trusting in one's own righteousness rather than fully relying on Christ."
TrueChristian,3c4lhc,ruizbujc,2,Sat Jul 4 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"I think you too quickly dismiss the greater concept that I believe /u/CowboyBigBoss is trying to make.  It all comes down to a definition of ""faith.""  I don't see any argument other than that a scriptural view of faith incorporates at least two different components: (1) an intellectual acknowledgment, and (2) an entrusting.  If we live our lives in a way that demonstrates a trust in a particular belief system, but don't intellectually acknowledge the truth behind it, we do not believe.  Such people are self-deceived hypocrites, pursuing religious practices because they think it will save them, all the while denying the power and person behind those practices.  Likewise, James 2 references those who have an intellectual acknowledgment of who Christ is and what he did, but refuse to entrust their lives to him.  Such people are dead in in their ""faith"" because their faith is not complete.  That is not to say that works do any form of saving or are even a prerequisite to salvation.  Rather, it is the entrusting part.  Entrusting itself also has two components: (1) an ownership, and (2) a transfer of power or possession.  In the context of salvation, all we have is our lives - and even these we received from God.  But he saw it fit to give transfer power and possession of our lives to us (not ownership - they were never ours and never will be).  In essence, God entrusted our lives to us.  But let's be clear - that's not to say God had faith in humanity, for he has no intellectual acknowledgment that we will accomplish his purposes without him.  Because of this, we cannot say God ""trusted"" us with our lives, rather he ""entrusted"" to us our lives.  What was the point of this entrusting?  That we would glorify Him by reciprocating the gesture.  We were created in His image to model His character and actions.  God's character and action was to entrust us with our lives.  Modeling Him would be to entrust our lives back to Him, just as He did.  Since all we have is power and possession of our lives, and we are incapable of giving possession back, our best is to transfer power over our lives to God.  This means that God gets to make the decisions over what we do and not us.  Note that this ""entrusting"" of power over our lives does not necessarily mean we have done anything.  It is, rather, us saying that God will choose what we do and when we do it.  Our imperfect ability to transfer power of our lives fully to God (resulting in the absence of ""works"") does not affect the willing desire in our hearts.  Rather, it is our job to create that willingness and it is God's job to generate the actions/works.  Even as a Christian, because I am in sinful flesh, I cannot do anything but sin apart from God's power enabling me to do otherwise.  Accordingly, no man can take credit for his own works, and because of this, the only thing we are capable of doing for God is giving him the power to do good in and through us.  As /u/deadby100cuts points out in his comment below, good works are a necessary byproduct of faith.  After all, if we give power over our lives to God, do you think he will decline to use it?  Will he tell us, ""Sorry, I didn't actually have a plan for you - I didn't really set apart good works in advance for you""?  No, he'll make use of the power that we give Him.  To clarify one point, I should probably be referencing ""God-pleasing works"" instead of ""good works.""  The word ""good"" is too muddled with human understanding and culture.  Anything that is not God-pleasing is sin.  There are things that seem ""good"" to us, but which are not God pleasing (Proverbs 14:12).  Verses like Isaiah 64:6 and Hebrews 11:6 clarify that ""God-pleasing"" works cannot occur without faith.  This is how we know that faith and God-pleasing works are distinct and not one and the same.  In light of all of this, God-pleasing works can't save us because they can't be performed until after we have already entrusted power over our lives to God.  Because I like illustrations (although this one may be a bit over-simplified): I can't draw a beautiful picture with my friend's pencil until he actually gives me the pencil.  Despite my telling him what I want the picture to look like, my friend would be incapable of drawing the picture himself if the pencil were in his own hand.  So, he cannot draw the picture that pleases me without first transferring power and possession over that thing which I must have in order to do it myself.  At the same time, although I might be able to get another pencil and still draw the picture, it would not have been my friend's pencil that was part of my pleasure - if anything, I would be annoyed and displeased as his refusing me such a simple request: to use his pencil.  [We may not view entrusting our lives to God as something so simple as giving a pencil, but to an infinite and all-powerful God who knows what he's going to do with our lives, he might think differently.]  Alternatively, if the person holds out his hand with his pencil toward me, but communicates that he doesn't really want me to have it or to draw anything with it that pleases Him, and that he really likes his pencil and wants to keep it for himself, he's just doing it because he thinks that is his obligation, I'm probably going to say, ""Sorry to be a bother ... I'll just go get another pencil instead.""  I'll tag /u/ColtonT66 here as well, since this would be most of my response to his general post."

TrueChristian,3c4lhc,ruizbujc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:24:00 2015 UTC,"I just base too much on feeling. It fianlly clicked with me; what is meant to be saved. But then my anxiety and self doubt came in, ""Am I really trusting in His works? Do I know what that means? Which metaphor about it makes most sense and feels correct? Is me saying, 'I trust in God to save me' the same as I trust in what Christ has done? What feels right? Do I have it right?"" Etc etc.   I believe that it like this; Jesus says, ""I have made it possible to save you eternally through my works. Do you trust what I have done to get you to heaven?"" Me: ""Yes, I trust what you have done."" Jesus: ""Then I will save you."" Is that correct??"
TrueChristian,3c4lhc,ruizbujc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:13:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's correct.  What you're saying sounds good at a surface level, but it could be misconstrued in a wrong context.  For example, per James 2, a demon could say, ""Yes, I trust that you have done all of this and believe it occurred.""  That's why I say, it's less about ""trusting"" and more about ""entrusting.""  When you have Jesus asking: ""Do you trust what I have done to get you to heaven?"" what is the ""trust"" all about?  It's something over which there is no direct connection to us other than an intellectual acknowledgment of the facts.  And we know with great certainty that intellectual acknowledgment alone is insufficient for salvation.  So, that's where I think your phrasing breaks down.  Instead, you have to incorporate some for of entrusting of yourself back to God.  You must acknowledge that your life is no longer your own to do with as you please.  When you entrust power over your life and decisions to God, even if he hasn't actually used that power to do any God-pleasing works yet, that's when you're saved.  Telling Jesus, ""Yes, I acknowledge that what you have done actually happened and that you did it for the reasons you stated and that yes, it can actually get me into heaven"" is not enough for salvation.  A person can intellectually acknowledge all of this and still choose to give Jesus the finger and walk away - and it happens all the time.    Let me give an example.  I like to reference doomsday preppers.  These people actually believe the world is going to end by some cataclysmic event, so they're gearing up for it.  Suppose one of them has the only possible way to guarantee your survival after nuclear fallout.  Now, suppose that person managed to convince you that this nuclear fallout was going to happen one year from today - and you genuinely believed them on an intellectual level - what are your possible responses?  (1) ""That's cool and all, but preparing for such an event is too hard, so oh well.""  (2) ""That's cool and all, but I'm okay with dying - I just can't stand you psycho people, so I'd rather burn with the nukes than have to join you.""  (3) ""That's terrible!  But screw your expertise - I'll come up with my own way to prepare; or maybe I'll follow my friend's way of preparing.""  (4) ""That's terrible!  What do I have to do to prepare?""  I'm sure there are other possibilities.  That said, all 4 of these scenarios are ones where someone ""trusts"" that what someone else is saying is true.  But only the last one might actually result in the person being saved.  In the context of Christianity, this heart-position occurs prior to any God-pleasing works actually being carried out, and thus the works aren't a factor.  Instead, they are a necessary product of the belief and entrustment.  That person is saying, ""I believe intellectually that what you are saying is true; and I also will give power over my preparation strategy to you and no one else."""

All I have to do is ""accept"" the gift: which is trusting His death was sufficient payment for my sins.   As previously noted, the sufficiency of this statement depends entirely on what you mean by ""trust.""

Every one of your theological beliefs is absolutely correct in every way?  That verse you posted doesn't mean that if you abide in Christ, you'll have everything figured out. It just doesn't. If you think you do, you're delusional.   Many, many Christians sincerely seek after God with their whole heart, and yet come to different conclusions about major aspects of theology. Because God isn't as knowable as all that. You cannot have God figured out. You can do your best, but if you're not even open to the possibility that you might not know everything, you're in trouble.   Recall God's statements to Job. You are not God.

I don't believe one can know the truth ""about"" God. The truth is God. We are told to seek first God and to align our hearts to His will.  ""A verse"" doesn't tell us this; the entirety of the Word tells us this.  At this point, because it's late and I'm on my phone (which I'm terrible typing with), I'll rehash what I said in another thread:  When we accept that God is truth, we actually have to accept what he says and not try to rationalize our way around it.  God tells us very clearly that there is such a thing as truth, it can absolutely be known, and that it is, in fact, God himself. To know God is to know truth.  With all due respect, the biggest risk Christians face is to deny that God has given us the truth - to believe that He has withheld something.  Remember Satan's first ever trick: ""Did God really say...?"" He convinced Adam and Eve (and all humanity) that there was more to truth than God and the Word.   Recall God's statements to Job. You are not God. You can never understand God's ways.   I am well aware of this. I never claimed to be equal to God in understanding or in knowing His perfect plan.  But God has spoken. The Word itself was made flesh. Everything we are meant to understand, God has given us. And everything God has given us is the truth. Each word has a divinely ordered reason for being where it is.  You know what I've found when I had trouble seeking truth? I wasn't perfectly seeking God first. I wasn't listening for an answer to my questions.  If you humbly seek God, He promises to lead you to truth. Regarding our salvation, He has provided all we will ever need.  So, again I ask you (and the OP): what is it that you think God has not provided? And are you prepared for His answer?"

TrueChristian,3c4deu,KarateCowboy,0,Sun Jul 5 05:47:27 2015 UTC,"There are two potential problems in this: (1) you aren't giving credence to those who have studied specific issues in-depth and have come to the pinacle of human's ability to comprehend an issue; or (2) you presuppose that because we are fallible humans, our understanding of the scriptures is inherently flawed, and thus we should always be open to other people's views of scriptures as possibly being higher than our own, even if one is the foremost authority on the subject.  Under the first issue, I can say nothing but to respect and honor those who are mature in the Lord, walking by His Spirit, and preach theologies that are the product of their relationship with Christ.  Do not spurn their confidence in their research and understanding purely on a technicality, and in doing so lose the wealth of wisdom they have to offer.  Their confidence is often rightly placed.  As to the second issue, if this is what you mean (as /u/tylerjarvis suggests elsewhere), then you have devalued the scripture of any meaning, because we could never ascertain its true meaning and our entire lives are not guided by God's Spirit, but by guess-work.  Separately, you would also run into the trouble that if my view has the potential to be flawed, and thus I can't trust my own views, why should I trust someone else's view any more?  Wouldn't their view have equal capacity to be flawed?  Suppose I believe the Holy Spirit has communicated something to me when I am reading the scriptures - and someone else also says the Holy Spirit told them something and that their conclusion is different and incompatible with mine.  It is possible that I have misperceived the Holy Spirit's work in me.  But isn't it equally possible (if not moreso) that the other person has a misperception of the Holy Spirit's work in him as well?  So, if there are at best equal possibilities of misperception, isn't it inherent to understanding and conclusions that I would trust my perception over someone else's?  To be clear, I'm not talking about a situation where I'm making a purely intellectual interpretation, in which case I would agree that we should always be open to new intellectual ideas that affect how we intellectually understand the scriptures.  But thank God we don't have to rely on intellect alone to ascertain the true meaning of scriptures, for we would be lost without the Spirit!  We would probably come to the wrong conclusions every time because human logic is defied by God's thoughts and intentions."
TrueChristian,3c4deu,KarateCowboy,2,Sun Jul 5 06:06:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful response.   Those who have studied specific issues in-depth and have come to the pinnacle of human's ability to comprehend an issue.   For many doctrines, this doesn't exist. Among scholars who have spent their lives studying the Bible with an honest, pure heart, there is a wide range of interpretations on some of the most central issues like predestination, atonement, and prevenient grace. This disparity of scholarly opinion demonstrates that there is no single pinnacle of human ability by which to comprehend much of Christian doctrine.   Because we are fallible humans, our understanding of the scriptures is inherently flawed.   I suppose, between your two categories, this is the one in which I should be categorized, although I would certainly not de-value the truth contained in Scripture and I would describe my position quite differently than you do.  John Wesley held four sources as key components to the understanding of our Christian faith. The foundation is Scripture - all other understanding must be affirmed by Scripture. The other three are reason (God-given intelligence), tradition (the understanding passed down from the generations of Christians before us), and experience (the working of the Holy Spirit in our lives).  I think the Bible contains a lot of passages that must be taken in context in order to truly understand their meanings. For example, for many pre-Civil War sincerely-Christian plantation owners, the Bible very clearly endorsed slavery as an institution. As we read Scripture today, though, we understand it much differently - this is because we have examined the greater context, the complete narrative of Scripture, and found that it compels us to treat all men as equals since all are created in the image of God.  So my point is this: We should not rely on a simple, face-value reading of Scripture alone to guide our understanding of God, because that leaves us wide-open to misinterpretation based on our own predisposed worldviews. We should read Scripture within a community with a variety of different perspectives and ideas so we may better understand the way the words speak to other people. Hearing the stories and interpretations of others - the ways that God is speaking to them through his word - can only help to clarify for us the breadth and depth of the Holy Scriptures.

TrueChristian,3c4deu,KarateCowboy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:29:56 2015 UTC,"For many doctrines, this doesn't exist.   It exists for every doctrine.  The ""pinnacle of human understanding"" doesn't mean ""the correct answer.""  It means the most information that any human being alive at that time is capable of comprehending with regard to a particular issue.  I would wager there are numerous scholars at any given time who have reached this point on most issues.  Those who differ don't do so because one person has more information than another that the first scholar didn't consider - they both see all of the same information and yet come to different conclusions.  This is normal and expected.   I think the Bible contains a lot of passages that must be taken in context in order to truly understand their meanings.    But you're also saying we can never be certain of the true meaning.  So, how do you know it's not ""flawed"" human understanding that believes historical context is the best way to understand the passage?   We should not rely on a simple, face-value reading of Scripture alone to guide our understanding of God, because that leaves us wide-open to misinterpretation based on our own predisposed worldviews.   I agree with this statement in its entirety.  And I agree that we should all edify one another through fellowship in Bible study and scriptural teaching.  This is essential toward growth.  But if someone has studied the scriptures on a particular issue and is rock-solid in their research on the culture, language, etc. - should such a person listen to the babblings of someone who hasn't studied the topic at all, simply on the grounds that they hold a unique view on it?  What if the person who studied already researched the other person's view?  Should he give it some unique credibility because of the number of other people who believe it?"

Also, I can't remember where in this chain of posts it was, but you make the comment about a business-owner holding his business out to the public means everyone.  But what if a business owner states in his articles of incorporation that because of religious reasons he only serves X, Y, and Z people and specifically excludes homosexuals or nudists in their element from that list?  Just because you conduct business on Main Street doesn't mean you're a place of public accommodation.  Night clubs are a great example, even having bouncers at the door to make sure the wrong kind of people don't get in.  They discriminate based on looks - pretty girls are cool, but not ugly ones.  How is the way a person looks not fundamentally ""who they are"" or otherwise ""arbitrary,"" given the ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" concept.  And yet we don't see an ""ugly people coalltion"" suing for equal treatment.  It's private property owned not by the state, but by private individuals for private business purposes.  Let's go to a more extreme example: the president.  The president is a public officer working in a place of public accommodation serving the needs and interests of the public.  What happens if a general member of the public wants to set up a meeting with him?  Probably going to get rejected.  What happens if a major celebrity wants to set up a meeting with the President?  Much greater chance of acceptance.  There is clear discrimination over who should be able to express their views to the president, which is decided upon by the president's discretion over who he wants to hear - the most arbitrary standard of all.  In short, discrimination for any number of reasons is blatantly permitted and legal in our country unless you fall within a protected class, over which discrimination on the basis of that protected class is prohibited.  ""Ugly people"" are not a protected class.  ""Poor people"" are not a protected class.  Race is a protected class in all states.  Sexual orientation is a protected class in some states and is not a protected class in others.  Even over all of this, I agree with /u/CowboyBigBoss in his ultimate conclusion that no class of persons should be protected to such a degree that a person should be forced to perform an action in violation of their religious beliefs.  One of the major principles of contracts law goes back to the idea that specific performance is always subordinate to monetary damages and only implemented when there is no reasonable alternative.  What was the Supreme Court's rationale on that issue?  Forcing someone to do something they don't want to do is akin to slavery.  Although I don't remember the case names, they referenced an actor/singer who refused to perform; the court said that even though the contract was valid, monetary damages were appropriate and they would not order someone to perform a service against their will.  In the present instance, the LGBT community does not have monetary damages because they can easily obtain the same result elsewhere.  Even setting that aside, damages could be calculated as the amount that another baker (or even the same one) would ordinarily charge for the service denied.  Instead, our government has (in some states) put on laws that don't allocate damages for discrimination of protected classes; rather, they actively punish it (ergo the term ""punitive damages"").  This is a clear violation of the constitution, as the government cannot punish someone for living out their faith - unless they can prove that they have a compelling interest and there is no lesser restrictive means of accomplishing that interest.  No state law punishing religious persons for denying services that would force them to violate their faith has yet been validated by the US Supreme Court as being pursuant to a compelling interest.  Will the US Supreme Court one day say that it has a compelling interest to ensure that homosexuals can force religious people to violate their faith in the interests of letting them shop wherever they want to shop?  Probably.  Will the Supreme Court determine that there is no less restrictive way to solve this problem than forced servitude?  Probably.  But it hasn't happened yet."

If your job violates your religious convictions, you can either go against your convictions or get another job.  If a Muslim grocery store clerk refuses to ring up anyone buying pork or alcohol, he loses his job regardless of whether or not other lanes will allow the transaction.  It's up to you to get a job that complies with the tenets of your religion.  If your job responsibilities change (like with the recent SCOTUS decision) then it's once again up to you to evaluate whether you want to continue working at that job.  It's not for everyone else to have to work around your religious beliefs, it's up to you to find a job which will allow you to comply with the demands of your conscience.  Should a Christian be able to get a job at an adult bookstore and refuse to ring up any transactions because that'd be supporting sin?  No.  Should a Satanist be able to get a job at a Christian bookstore and not ring up any transactions because that'd be supporting Christianity?  No.  It's up to the employee to find a job that allows them to work within the confines of their chosen moral code.  That's really all there is to it."

Here's the arugment Dr. Anderson presents on ""Marriage Equality "".  On top of that, you have to understand 85% of people have a faith of some sort, and many, if not, all, recognize marriage is between man and woman. Christianity just happens to be the largest, therefore, the most targeted in this situation.   If you have 85% of people with a traditional definition of marriage, you have ~15% of people who have no faith, therefore, have the revisionists view of marriage, assuming based on the roots of marriage in religion.  Out of those numbers, somewhere, is the gay population at 3.8%. So that means people are trying to redefine 85% of peoples definition of marriage for theirs, to include their adult relationship of preference, and that's not how it should work.

I say this only partially as a lament. It was very frustrating to see the traditional marriage movement represented publicly solely by people who just said ""God wants it this way,"" which was always a brain-dead argument to use in the public sphere.  We should use these lessons to do better in the future.

To use the ""God wants it this way"" argument was enough in an explicitly and majority Christian society. But in our post-modern society that is backed by relativism, it wasn't persuasive. They won't accept God's will if they reject the very idea of God.  The battle between the destructive nature of sin and the will of God must be fought, as always, in our own hearts first and in our own churches and communities.   Even within our own churches, that post-modern relativism has crept in. We stopped protecting the sanctity of marriage - as an institution divinely ordered for the stability of God's creation and the promotion of God's will - in our own lives.  For instance, how many people sit in pews across the country with their second or third or fourth wives with no spiritual correction from their brothers and sisters in Christ or their ministers? Some of us came to embrace ""no fault divorce"" as heartily as society at large.  We have to learn to share our faith with an increasingly faithless society. But every heart does truly yearn to know God. The best start would be to show them what Christ's love and God's perfect order has done for us.  We show them not just that ""God wants it this way"", but why He wants it this way. And I think the why arguments are those that can be tailored for a secular society."

However, same-sex marriage is a behavior and an action that someone is performing (whether you believe homosexuality is genetic or not is irrelevant, this is discussing the behavior of same sex marriage). Not endorsing a particular behavior, the marriage between two homosexuals, is qualitatively very different than discriminating between a particular and unchangable quality of being. It's not that the baker is refusing service of all types based on the fact that ""we don't serve gays here"", but rather the celebration in particular. Hence, the baker, in this case, would gladly bake a birthday cake for a gay customer, or a retirement cake, or any other type of cake celebrating any other type of occasion - however, this particular cake and celebration is something that the baker has a religious freedom to not endorse the celebration of."

It's no different than doing a loan for an adulterer or doing a loan for a fornicator or doing a loan for a liar.  Homosexuals pretending to marry and the law that has made it legal for homosexuals to do this equates the sin of homosexuality to the sanctioned and blessed relationship of a man and a woman in a marriage. It's horrible.  This is another case where people just do not see how terrible this sin really is or any other sin for that matter.  The sexual relationship between a man and his wife is not only ordered by God but it is blessed by God.   Sex between two men or two women is called an abomination by God. According to Romans chapter 1 verse 18 to 32, homosexuality is a judgement.

The light has come into the world and they preferred darkness because their deeds are dark. It's natural for people who don't know God and doesn't have a relationship with him to sin, because it's their nature. Godless straight and gays people are in the same boat.  It's our job as Christians to display the best of Christ and to show an alternate way of life, a better and holier way that broke the trap of sin, and I don't think stating that straight people can turn to God and not gay people, or that the same sin is different and should be considered different because of the people targeted is really beneficing our and Christ's cause."

Your trying to deflect the attention from the truth of what the Bible says about homosexuality by bringing up other sins isn't going to work with me or at the judgment seat of Christ  I do not know about your wedding, but I spent a lot of time with the florist and the photographer and the person who do the food and cakes. We met more than once. They did come to the wedding and set things up. They were involved.

TrueChristian,3bxyp8,foxconnect,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:45:22 2015 UTC,"I remember you now, and that you are an exceptionally friendly person to debate :)  As a libertarian I agree that business owners should be able to discriminate on any grounds they want, including race, religion, etc., even though I think discriminating based on race is immoral.  But that's the cost of true freedom and liberty.  That's where I stand legally.  Beyond the legal system:  I think there are only two internally consistent views of morality.  Moral nihilism where there is no such thing as morality beyond personal preference, and divine command where morality is God's intent for how we should live.  In regard to this, a common parable I share is my friend Hypothetical Harry.  Harry believes murder and rape are moral actions since they help him spread his seed and eliminate competition in the game of natural selection.  ""It's just the programming that evolution gave me"", he says.  ""Just as your genetic programming tells you differently.""  He even cited this study that shows a correlation between missing DNA repeats in androgen receptors and violent criminal behavior.  Under atheism I can't even prove him wrong--since evolution has no concept of right or wrong, only reproductive fitness.  However, if God exists and humans were created with specific purposes in mind, then God himself can clarify which programming is the intent vs what's an aberration caused by mutation.  ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" would be a good place to start.  So whether objective morality exists all hangs on that, and if Harry understands intent vs nature then he can work to overcome that nature.  As a consequence of this, I don't recognize any claim that ""X is morally good"" or ""Y is morally bad"" outside the context of theism."

For example, if you had a small rural area with just one or two families with same-sex parents and the business owners of the area refused service, that action would force those families to relocate or travel longer distances to get necessary services. This is the key reason why there are laws against class discrimination when it comes to commerce. You can refuse service to individual people for various reasons (being rude, not dressing appropriately, etc), but once you start refusing based on class (no women, no blacks, no gays, etc) you're affecting the mobility of classes."

Operating a business and entering contracts is heavily regulated and often restricted (with each restriction justified).  Religious freedom has complex interactions with the rest of our laws, and neither adrent secularists nor religious folk are super happy with all the details. Legally, ""religious freedom"" means the government can't restrict your right to practice your religion, or no religion at all. Sometimes that means you get exceptions to drug laws, but if want to stone adulterers, that's going to get restricted.  Discriminating based on sexual orientation falls somewhere in between right now. For places of ""public accommodation"" (e.g. stores, hotels, restaurants), federal law prohibits from discriminating based on race, religion, and some other factors.

Maybe Christian-owned companies should take a stand against remarriage, or maybe providing a service in a business setting is not the same as ""giving approval"" and we are getting swept away in the political and social energy of the culture war surrounding homosexuality.

The bible is a start, but then there are encyclicals, council documents, other official documents, sermons, and books.  Faith formation is a lifelong activity.     Fellowship     This will vary from community to community.  I think most fellowship comes at committees/ministry and special functions.     Breaking of Bread     Mass is held most days in most parishes.     Prayer     Pray before meals, pray a daily rosary, go through a list of intercessions, meditate: one's prayer life is a consideration to itself.  Activities like fasting should also come in this pillar.     Somehow, over the last 2000 years, church went from ""continually"" to ""about 1 to 3 hours a week"". What gives?     People have gotten lazy and distracted.  It's kind of easy to let Christ to slip from #1 to #3 in our life.  We might not notice.  All of the pillars hold Christ at #1, but we don't pay attention on Sunday, we stop praying, we take things on ""faith""(credulity), and we gossip/fight.

TrueChristian,3bznff,WiseChoices,-1,Fri Jul 3 21:59:15 2015 UTC,"I am so sick to death of people going on and on about tongues and trying to make them out to be something they are not.  His entire argument falls apart with one scripture verse.   1 Corinthians 14:2   For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit.   This means that tongues are not the ability to purely speak new languages to communicate with other, because if your talking to someone else other than god ITS NOT SPEAKING IN TONGUES.  This means at Pentecost, they wern't running around speaking and preaching when they spoke in tongues, but praying to god. This also explains why peter needed to stand up and preach. They wern't hearing people preach to them, they were hearing people praise god in their own language. That meant peter still had to share the gospel so they could know whats going on and have the option to join in on salvation.   When someone speaks in tongues, they are not speaking gibberish (assuming its real and they arn't faking it, because lets be real, its easy to fake but that doesn't mean its ALL fake). They are speaking an actual language, however its a language they don't know, which means to THEM it sounds like gibberish. I only speak english, if someone walked in my room and started speaking spanish to me, it would sound like gibberish, because I don't know it. Also its pretty clear that the person speaking much of the time doesn't know what they are saying, otherwise this scripture wouldn't be needed.  1 corinthians 14 (broken up with comments by me)   13 For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.   OK so paul is straight up saying, that when he speaks in tongues, HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE IS SAYING. In fact he goes as far to say his mind is unfruitful. He also shows that praying in a tongue is a thing. If it was only to speak to others it would be pointless to pray in a tongue.    15 So what shall I do?  I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.    His response isn't that he will stop praying in tongues, but that he will pray with his mind at the same time. For the purposes of THIS passage, when paul talks of praying in the spirit he is speaking of praying with tongues because above he says "" For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays"" so its clear in this passage the concept of praying in the spirit = tongues (Though I would personally argue that praying in tongues is a type of praying in the spirit, but not the only manifestation of praying in the spirit)    16 Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? 17 You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.   18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.   Lets be clear here, given the context of everything else in this letter and others that paul has wrote he is not condemning speaking in tongues AT ALL. In other places he has said that speaking in tongues should not be forbidden (1 Corinthians 14:39) and he says the he speaks in tongues more than everyone else (1 Corinthians 14:18) and he is also wanting everyone else to speak tongues as well in this same chapter.  also pay attention here. Pauls says ""but in the church I would rather"".  This seems to indicate that he is speaking in tongues OUTSIDE the church service, and since he talks about praying in tongues  and speaks them more than anyone, that he is probably praying in them alone at times.   5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy   He isn't putting down tongues, but rather raising prophesy.  Paul thought very highly of speaking in  tongues, otherwise he would not wish them to do it, or speak in such positive terms about it or tell them not to forbid it.  One last thing on tongues.   1 Corinthians 14:4   Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church   This gets used for a reason not to speak in tongues, people say its selfish, it doesn't edify the church, ect. Thats garbage, its a gift from god to be used (if you receive that gift, many don't). Its A GOOD THING to edify yourself, we NEED personal edification as well as church wide edification.  Further more the gifts have not ceased. Thats some twisted scripture. Here is the full passage.  1 Corinthians 13   8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.   Last time I checked, we were not speaking to god face to face, we do not fully know god as he knows us. This is speaking of when christ comes back, until he comes back we live in ""part"", when he comes back and recreates the earth then we will be in perfection. This is not talking about scripture being completed, there is NOTHING in this passage to show that they are talking about scripture. These letters arn't parables, they were written to be read in front of the church at the time. They are straight forward and not full of riddles."
TrueChristian,3bznff,starchaser57,3,Fri Jul 3 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"A hilariously incoherent post but I'll give this a shot.   This means at Pentecost, they wern't running around speaking and preaching when they spoke in tongues, but praying to god.   What an absurd torturing of the text of Scripture to prop up one's false theology. Try reading Acts 2 sometime, buddy.  Acts 2   5 Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. 6 And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own [g]language. 7 They were amazed and astonished, saying, “[h]Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 8 And how is it that we each hear them in our own [i]language [j]to which we were born? 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and [k]Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and [l]visitors from Rome, both Jews and [m]proselytes, 11 Cretans and Arabs—we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.” 12 And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” 13 But others were mocking and saying, “They are full of [n]sweet wine.”   They are clearly, no debating, speaking ""of the mighty deeds of God"" (preaching) loudly in other languages and not simply praying to themselves in some sort of prayer language. The miraculous tongues was a sign to the unbelieving Jews that God was speaking to all nations of men and calling them into one new spiritual body composed of both Jews and Gentiles. “This people” refers to the Jewish nation to whom the prophet Isaiah was speaking. You even admit this later in your post yourself,   When someone speaks in tongues, they are not speaking gibberish (assuming its real and they arn't faking it, because lets be real, its easy to fake but that doesn't mean its ALL fake). They are speaking an actual language, however its a language they don't know, which means to THEM it sounds like gibberish.   A real head scratcher. Though you're right, it wouldn't make sense for them to be praying in Arabic. They're not praying in Arabic to God. They're speaking in Arabic by the Holy Spirit so that the Arab brother in proximity will hear what was being proclaimed. A foundational fact about biblical tongues is that they were real languages, not some sort of unintelligible mutterings.   OK so paul is straight up saying, that when he speaks in tongues, HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE IS SAYING. In fact he goes as far to say his mind is unfruitful. He also shows that praying in a tongue is a thing. If it was only to speak to others it would be pointless to pray in a tongue.   Read 1 Corinthians 14:13-14 carefully. Paul is not saying that he never understands what he is praying in tongues. Paul is saying that one must pray for interpretation of tongues because otherwise they can never be edified by their own words. Paul is speaking in a proverbial sense and is not describing his prayer life. I'll give you the better translation.  1 Corinthians 14:13-14   13 Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.   Alright now verse 15 simply follows the train of thought.  1 Corinthians 14:13-15   13 Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 15 What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.   It appears that the speaker with Tongues in some instances could recall, on recovery, what he had uttered in his trance-ecstasy, so as to render it into rational speech. Paul prays to interpret what is being said in the trance of tongues so that he can relay it to the people of the churches intelligibly.  From Matthew Henry's Commentary   14:6-14 Even an apostle could not edify, unless he spoke so as to be understood by his hearers. To speak words that have no meaning to those who hear them, is but speaking into the air. That cannot answer the end of speaking, which has no meaning; in this case, speaker and hearers are barbarians to each other. All religious services should be so performed in Christian assemblies, that all may join in, and profit by them. Language plain and easy to be understood, is the most proper for public worship, and other religious exercises. Every true follower of Christ will rather desire to do good to others, than to get a name for learning or fine speaking.   The final time that we see tongues speaking is in Acts 19. By that point in church history there was no question that God was calling the Gentiles by the gospel.  Once a sign has been fulfilled, it doesn't get recycled for repetitive use all through the Church Age.   Thus the gift of tongues ceased even before the events recorded in the book of Acts concluded, but the gifts of prophecy and knowledge continued to operate until “that which is perfect is come,” which was the completed canon of Scripture."

TrueChristian,3bznff,WiseChoices,-2,Fri Jul 3 21:30:06 2015 UTC,"What an absurd torturing of the text of Scripture to prop up one's false theology. Try reading Acts 2 sometime, buddy.   I have read acts 2,many times in fact. Last time I checked, speaking the amazing things god has done back to him was a form of praise. They wern't speaking to the people but god (unless 1 Corinthians 14:2 is a lie). They people overheard and were confused (thus the whole ""are they drunk"" attitude by some). Then peter got up and preached. If they were already preaching why did peter need to preach? Because they wern't, they were praising god and yes it WAS also validating and acting as a sign, but they were praying.   (1 Corinthians 14:2)   For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God.  God was speaking to all nations of men and calling them into one new spiritual body composed of both Jews and Gentiles   Side note, but this wasn't about the gentiles yet. Gentiles didn't get brought into the picture until later in Acts. The people who heard this would have been jews (unless there was a random gentile who happened to walk by). The jews had come from all over the known world for Pentecostal, not what we think of as Pentecostal but the jewish celebration of Pentecostal. Thats why jews from all over were in the city.    A foundational fact about biblical tongues is that they were real languages, not some sort of unintelligible mutterings.   I'm not arguing against that, however its important to remember that last time I checked, neither of us knows every single language spoken on the earth, in every dialect, past, present, and future. So we cannot be quick to judge something as gibberish simply because we do not understand it.   Read 1 Corinthians 14:13-14 carefully. Paul is not saying that he never understands what he is praying in tongues. Paul is saying that one must pray for interpretation of tongues because otherwise they can never be edified by their own words. Paul is speaking in a proverbial sense and is not describing his prayer life. I'll give you the better translation.   If he always understood what he was praying, then that verse wouldn't be needed.   what he had uttered in his trance-ecstasy,   What makes  you think they went into a trance? There is no biblical support for that, in fact, generally in scripture the spiritual gifts were mostly under the control of the human who had them to a degree. They could choose not to do them at the time, god didn't just stick them in some trance.  There is NO biblical evidence that they went into some sort of trance.    Matthew Henry's   Why would I care what he has to say when its clearly against scripture?   Once a sign has been fulfilled, it doesn't get recycled for repetitive use all through the Church Age.    Well, I hate to break this to you but god has done some signs more than once, I mean, in the bible a LOT of difrent people got healed. So apparently God is ok with ""recycling"" a sign. Furthermore there is no evidence to support the fact that the sign was ""fulfilled"". It wasn't a sign, it was spoken of as a spiritual gifts, which in 1 Corinthians 12  the bible refers to as manifestations. Which means they arn't just gifts handed out but the active result of the holy spirit showing up and working. It doesn't mean he is absent if they arn't active and flowing, but if they are its his will, and if god wills something my advice is you don't get in his way.   Thus the gift of tongues ceased even before the events recorded in the book of Acts concluded, but the gifts of prophecy and knowledge continued to operate until “that which is perfect is come,” which was the completed canon of Scripture.   Firstly. There is no evidence they ceased before the book of acts concluded, by that logic we can say they stopped eating because it wasn't recorded. Secondly, I adressed that passage. If you have even a SHRED of intelectual honesty you can't say that passage is talking about scripture, because it clearly states perfection comes when we are face to face with god. Last time I checked, we wern't."

Atheist means you're satisfied there's sufficient proof of no deity; considering the top minds of this generation are heavily agnostic (and have no satisfying explanation for paraphenomena), and those of past generations (even post-Darwin) were theists, I'm wondering what possible ""proof"" that could be, considering all the actual proof to the contrary. Darwin died a Christian. Newton was in direct contact. Einstein had this to say:   “As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene. Jesus is too colossal for the pen of phrasemongers, however artful. No man can dispose of Christianity with a bon mot. I unquestionably support the historical existence of Jesus. No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life. No man can deny the fact that Jesus existed. nor that his sayings are beautiful. Even if some of them have been said before, no one has expressed them so divinely as He.”   So please, enlighten us all; how have you succeeded where Einstein failed?"
TrueChristian,3by01w,redpandapaul,2,Fri Jul 3 23:49:38 2015 UTC,"I never down voted you, I just commented. I know I can't show you proof that I didn't, but please take it from me, I did not downvote you and I'm offended that you would just assume that.  Atheism is not an assertion of knowledge, it is simply the lack of belief in a deity. Also, agnosticism is not mutually exclusive with atheism. Whenever someone tells me they are agnostic, I ask them ""agnostic what? Theist or atheist?"" Because those words are answers to two different questions. The chart on this page describes this accurately.  Also the Einstein argument is an argument from authority, and just because Einstein says something doesn't mean it's true. I'm not claiming I'm better or smarter than Einstein, and I don't think I succeeded when he failed, I just think that I wasn't convinced and he was. Note: I checked the Wikipedia page for his religious views and it said he was pantheistic and sometimes identified as agnostic without ""dissassociating"" with the atheist label. That page may not be 100% true, but I don't think that anyone other than that person can argue using and understand that person's beliefs."

I'm sorry that scientific consensus on agnosticism seems like appeal to authority; is that how you feel about all scientific consensus, useless for consideration? If I went around calling myself a gnostic anti-string theorist, wouldn't you think that was a pointless thing to go around claiming I have knowledge of when I don't? I certainly wouldn't expect a warm reception from people when the first thing I shove in their face is how I ""know"" everything they have proof of is false, yet hide for shelter whenever confronted for that knowledge."

I believe this phrase is something that Satan has twisted today to deceive the world.  Absolutely, the Bible does indeed say that God is love [1 John 4:8].  However, that is only part of who God is.  He is also Holy [1 Peter 1:16] ,Good [Matthew 19:16-17], Righteous and Just [Deuteronomy 32:4].     In fact, the entire thing we are being saved from is God's Holy, Good, Righteous, Just Judgement on the wicked of this world.   God so loved the world that he sent Jesus to take our place for the judgement we each deserved.   The first half of Romans is entirely about God's impartial judgement on the wicked,  our inherent wickedness, our need for forgiveness,  and justification by the work of Jesus.  Simplifying that message to ""God is Love"" is a horrible perversion as man always wants to bring God down to man's level.  The Love that Jesus showed on the cross was to save man from the consequence of sin, not to accept man's sin."

""You shall not hate your fellow countryman in your heart; you may surely reprove your neighbor, but shall not incur sin because of him.

TrueChristian,3bvk56,drewtam,2,Fri Jul 3 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"I think Jesus confronting the adulterous woman at the well in John 4 is a better example.    Jesus intrigues her with an offer of the water of eternal life. When she asks for this water, Jesus confronts her about her adultery & divorces. He was not mistaken when He asked her about getting her husband, it was not a tangential topic. He knew ahead of time (power) all about her family status and choices. He is calling this adulterous woman to confess and to repentance. In this context... His confrontation of her sin is the water of eternal life. He gives her exactly what she asks for. She detracts by talking about going to proper place to pray/worship about it. Again, Jesus redirects from worship location back to worshiping in Spirit and truth; worship that comes from people who have humbled themselves to repentance and have changed their lives.     For this is what love for God is: to keep His commands."

Love is seeing a person as more than their sexual orientation, or skin color, or past deeds.  Love is an act of sacrifice - sacrificing yourself for another person, whether you're sacrificing time, money, or your life.  Christianity is a religion of love. Love is the two greatest commandments. All the law is fulfilled in one word: Love. You can give your body to be burned, you can prophesy and have amazing knowledge, but without love you're like an instrument making sound, but not music. Without love, what you have is nothing.  Christians should be the most loving people on the face of the Earth. I heard a preacher put up a sign on his business saying ""No Gays Allowed."" That's despicable, that's not Christlike, for at this time in American history, Christian businesses should be putting signs in reaction to that one as ""All Gays Allowed.""

There will be bright spots even in Western countries and rest of the world. When Jesus says that last days are like day of Noah, it is really applied to whole world (lawlessness, continually sinning, and so on which is described in Genesis 9)"
TrueChristian,3bvps3,crono15,8,Thu Jul 2 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"What other prophecies do you believe have been fulfilled, other than Israel becoming a nation again?  For what it's worth, I think it's pretty demonstrable that there are fewer armed conflicts going on right now than at any time in the past 200 years, and that modern medicine has blunted the mortality rates of just about every disease in the world. It is easy to become depressed when reading the news about Ukraine or Ebola, but keep in mind they make the news because they are the exceptions (tragic as those situations are), not the rule.   Personally, I find it so hard to take talk of the End Times seriously. Ever since Jesus ascended there have been people convinced that He was returning in their lifetimes, including Paul himself. Every. Single. One of them has been wrong. I know we are exhorted to be like the wise virgins, and not the foolish ones (Matthew 25), but I am also reminded that in 1 Thessalonians Paul says that Jesus will return like a thief in the night. As a result, I generally ignore such talk. Just my personal viewpoint."

TrueChristian,3bvps3,akubhai,3,Thu Jul 2 18:14:04 2015 UTC,There are fewer wars as Yoojine said.   Fewer diseases.   What prophecies are there about technology?  Moral decline? How's that? Some stuff may be worse but other is better. Slavery is pretty much seen as a wrong in most of the world. People are upset about gay marriage but for a lot of history pederasty was accepted and not it is not. Wild fires have always happened. Is there an increase?  The star of bethlehem?

TrueChristian,3bvps3,darthjoey91,3,Fri Jul 3 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"With so many opinions and interpretations of scripture, and especially the Revelation, I think folks tend to look past the important message and distract themselves with irrelevant details. The important part is that there is AN END. Yours may be today! Or next week… or 50 years from now. And humanity's end is the same. It doesn't matter. It's completely out of our hands. What's important is ensuring we're right with God now so that we're not taken by surprise with disastrous results later!"
TrueChristian,3bvps3,SpiffyToes,3,Thu Jul 2 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Everything that modern people say to point to now being the cusp of the end times hinges on the nation of Israel. It seems pretty clear from prophecy that Israel needs to be around in the end times, but I'm not sure if the modern state of Israel is actually the dry bones forming flesh prophesied in Ezekiel. It could be, but I believe there would need to be a great religious revival in that land for that to happen.  Pretty much, there's a lot that still needs to happen before Jesus can come back."
TrueChristian,3bvps3,PaedragGaidin,4,Fri Jul 3 01:45:54 2015 UTC,I believe that most everything prophesied was accomplished within the first 30 years of the existence of the church and what we await is the triumphal return of Christ and the renewal of the earth.   But I'm Presbyterian and eschatology is a loaded question for me.
TrueChristian,3bvps3,balbach57,3,Thu Jul 2 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe. There's no way to know. Christ might return today, or a million years from now.   I would be very wary of taking current events and trying to apply them to current world events. Even if bad things are happening today, the Church has been through far worse wars, famines, plagues, political and social upheavals, and moral dilemmas. The world of 2015 is in many ways way better than the world of 1915, or 1815. Compared to, say, 1350, we're in such better shape that comparison becomes almost silly."
TrueChristian,3bvps3,Zzyyzxx,2,Thu Jul 2 17:44:57 2015 UTC,"I believe we could be approaching the end times. However, I'd be cautious, throughout history there have been many people citing current events of the day. Claiming the end was near.   Jesus even said that only the Father knows the exact time (Matthew 24:36). With that said, in that same chapter, Jesus tells us to always live with the anticipation that any moment could be that time (Matthew 24:42-51)."
TrueChristian,3bvps3,App1eEater,3,Thu Jul 2 15:27:56 2015 UTC,For whatever reason there's a rising number of Christians who refuse to accept the reality of the end times. All it takes is a little study of scripture and observation of the world today to see that we are clearly living in the end times. As for those who will say 'Jesus doesn't even know'; the bible says you will know the season.
TrueChristian,3bvps3,App1eEater,4,Thu Jul 2 23:28:52 2015 UTC,Didn't Jesus say that even he didn't know when he would be coming back? That would make it pretty clear to me that we don't have any idea if we're living in the end times.

For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. For when they say, ""Peace and safety!"" then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as others [do], but let us watch and be sober.   Jesus said:   day and hour no one knows   Paul said:   But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.   Paul did not say we should know the day or hour, but we should know when it is near and watch.  And in Hebrews 10:24-25:   And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.

Why would Revelations tell us of these signs if not for us to be aware or take heed of them?

If spoken against almost anyone is condemned or mocked, especially if based on religious grounds. Not only that but war, advancing technology, disobedience in the newer generations, disease, etc."

TrueChristian,3bw0gg,crono15,3,Thu Jul 2 17:09:26 2015 UTC,"I'm an amil partial preterist, and I believe that a lot of the apocalyptic prophecy in Scripture was fulfilled in late antiquity, by the pagan Roman Emperors and their persecutions of the Church and destruction of the Jewish Temple (and with it the destruction of Judaism as it was in Christ's day). Personally, I think Nero fits the bill the best, but it could be others, or perhaps symbolic of the corrupt and heathen Roman state as a whole.  Thus, I don't think there's going to be some future singular Antichrist or False Prophet figures, or a massive Tribulation. I don't believe in the ""Rapture"" as commonly portrayed by Left Behind, etc.   Christ will come again to judge the living and the dead, and His Kingdom will have no end. That's enough for me. I don't think speculating on the particulars (or worse, trying to shoehorn current events into Biblical prophecy, as some Christians are wont to do) is worth the time and effort."

TrueChristian,3bw0gg,SoCalExile,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"The problem with amillennialism  is that it throws out much of what is said in Revelation, calling it all symbolic, even to the point of claiming that references to Israel and Jews really mean the church, despite the greater context of scripture, where Jews mean Jews, Israel means Israel, and the church is called the church, the saints, or the Gentiles.   Then there's the idea that we are in a metaphorical millennium where, instead of being ruled by Christ, we are actually ruled by the church, even though when the Bible says Christ, it means Christ. Also note that the earth has never had 1000 years of peace, much less 100.   The amill view has some appeal, but doesn't line-up with Scripture without throwing out or ignoring a lot of it."
TrueChristian,3bw0gg,PaedragGaidin,2,Thu Jul 2 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"I could easily say the same about pretrib and dispensationalism, which rely on interpretations of Scriptural passages that are tenuous at best, and not in keeping with what the Apostles and the early Church Fathers taught.  It's like atonement theories: none gives a complete picture of the Atonement, and using one to the exclusion of all others (or specifically excluding one for whatever reason) leads to a broken and dangerous theology."
TrueChristian,3bw0gg,SoCalExile,2,Thu Jul 2 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that when it comes to end-time prophecy, the early church would have no idea about some of the things we take for granted today. Where it states about the whole earth celebrating the supposed death of the two witnesses (Rev 11:10), or the three messengers in Rev. 14,  it's something that we can appreciate with the advent of mass media and instant communications, but not prior to the 20th century.   Dispensationalism is nothing more than saying that, in military terms, God has different phases to His operational and strategic plans for the redemption of humankind; something easily realized in scripture, once you see how long the church age is, and the resurgence of the state of Israel. BTW. Christ's coming is abrupt, not very soon (Rev. 1:1).    Pretrib is a realization that the the coming of Christ is described in two different ways: in the clouds, with the church rising to meet Him, and descending from the heavens, with great thunder and triumphant glory. And a appreciation of the wedding analogies that Christ and the prophets used. BTW, have you noticed the church is not mentioned after Revelation 3, until the Bride of Christ is mentioned in Rev. 19?"

It's a way of categorizing and organizing the Catholic Church's teachings (and in fact, it does so with extensive citations to both Scripture and the Church Fathers). The Catechism itself is neither doctrine nor dogma, but it serves as a primary tool through which to teach them."
TrueChristian,3bw0gg,SoCalExile,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:05:24 2015 UTC,Then why cite it in place of scripture?
TrueChristian,3bw0gg,PaedragGaidin,3,Thu Jul 2 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"Two reasons.   Catholics do not regard the Scriptures as the sole source of Christian doctrine and practice, they are complemented by Sacred Tradition, the oral teachings of Christ to the Apostles, which the Apostles passed down to their successors, and onward until today. Note that probably 90% of Catholic teachings are explicitly or implicitly taught in Scripture.  Explaining what we believe and why is often more complicated than simply citing some Bible verses. What is the Trinity? Was Jesus divine, and if so, what about His human nature? How should we interpret the Book of Revelation mean? Why do Catholics oppose fetal stem cell research? All of these require Scripture, but also an expanded explanation. And sure, you can answer these questions with detailed citations from Scripture, the Church Fathers, the Church Councils, and the writings of our saints, martyrs, and leaders, but that won't be anywhere near concise enough for either serious but casual discussions or basic Christian education. That's where the Catechism comes in. Think of it as a very detailed statement of faith."
TrueChristian,3bw0gg,SoCalExile,0,Thu Jul 2 22:35:09 2015 UTC,"90%? That's it? Of course if you stick to Scripture alone it'd be 100%.  It's the 10% that gets ya.   And the claims of apostolic succession are moot to say the least.   The Bible teaches us to follow Christ, not a church."

Cathecism is written by men who studied this issue their whole life. Men who are familiar with Greek and Latin, theology and philosophy. It is also written and supported by Magisterium which lays down our teachings.   So...the Bible isn't inerrant?   Inerrancy is protestant conception not ours, we have different conception of inerrancy.

Interesting you brought up Vatican II because it implies that what was taught before wasn't correct; so it seems RCC teaching wasn't right after all!    BTW, the Bible is reliable or it isn't. It's inerrant or it isn't. You can't place faith in other books, traditions, etc. without logically implying that the Bible is incomplete.

TrueChristian,3bw0gg,rethcir_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"I've always heard the term ""antichrist"" broken down into three or four components.    ""that's anti-christ"" = something or anything (usually an opinion) that is hostile to Christianity's beliefs. the spirit of Antichrist = any person, institution or thing that denies that Christ is the Son of God. The liar referred to in 1 John 2:22.  The kingdom / people of the Antichrist = Some nation or ethnic group that believes the lie (see above), and initially hosts the person-of-the-antichrist and is the nation/ethnic group that the person-of-the-antichrist comes out of.  The person-of-the-Antichrist = The ""Beast out of the sea"", (Rev 13). A.k.a, the 'first horseman' (Rev 6), the person who deceives the whole world with a false peace and sets up the abomination of desolation (Matt 24:15).      That's usually how I hear it all broken down."
TrueChristian,3bw0gg,Pistis-,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"Revelation 13:   1: Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name.   The sea signifies “the sea of Gentile peoples” this beast is the Antichrist and he is a Gentile. The dragon (Satan) also had  seven heads and ten horns.   This is Satan’s son a Nephilim (Daniel 2:43). He is called the beast that ascends out of the  bottomless pit in Revelation 11:7; that Satan has a son should not surprise us. Satan is a great imitator and his success in  deceiving man is due to his skill in counterfeiting the things of God.   The ten horns are the ten kings of the One World  Government (Daniel 2:42); the earth at this time will be divided into ten unions or kingdoms which will be the One World  Government. We are seeing the beginning of this; European Union, African Union, North American Union. The seven heads are Satan’s seven super kingdoms (Daniel 2:38-42), Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, and the One World Government.  The dragon’s seven crowns are on his seven heads signifying his rule over his seven super kingdoms; the  Antichrist’s ten crowns are on his ten horns signifying his rule over the ten kings of the One World Government of Satan’s seventh and last kingdom.   2: Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.   Daniel uses four animals to describe the course of Satan’s kingdoms (Daniel 7:3-8) from Daniel’s time to the reign of Christ  on earth. The first three animals are a lion (Babylonian), a bear (Medo-Persian), and a leopard (Greek).  The fourth animal  was a dreadful, indescribable beast (Roman); John presents this beast as the extension of the fourth beast of Daniel 7,  connecting Antichrist’s empire with the characteristics of the great empires of the past.   The beast is a modern, world totalitarian government; whose leader is the Antichrist (little horn in Daniel 7:8). With any brief empire that has but one ruler, the government is totally identified with the ruler; like Hitler and Nazi Germany.   3: And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast.   The Antichrist gets a fatal head wound that is healed; Zech 11:17. This is truly an Antichrist; he even imitates Jesus in His death and Resurrection. The world will believe this, and it will cause them to marvel and worship the beast.  Since the beast's heads represent Satan's super kingdoms, one of the kingdoms under Satan's authority perished (Assyrian), but the  Antichrist will revive it to the amazement of the world.   4: So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, ""Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?""   The world clearly worships both the Antichrist and Satan, this is because the people believe the lie and think that the  Satan is God. In 2 Cor.11:14-15 Paul states “for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.   Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to  their works.”   11: Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.   The ‘sea’ is the gentile peoples (Isaiah 60:1-5) and the ‘earth’ is the Jewish people. This beast is the false prophet and he is a Jew. Israel will accept him as their messiah (John 5:43). Satan gives his external power to the first beast, his spirit to the second, so that he speaks as a dragon.    12: And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.   Satan the great imitator of God sets up his unholy trinity. Satan is the anti-father; Antichrist is the anti-son, and the false prophet is the anti-holy spirit. It would seem that the false prophet only has power when in the sight of the Antichrist.  The false prophet leads the world in a new religion that worships the image of the beast which is really Satan.   13: He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.   In Deuteronomy 13:1-5, God warns His people to judge a worker of miracles by their message, not only by their works. The great imitator copies the miracle of the two witnesses who are ministering during this period.   14: And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived.   This idolatrous image is what Jesus, Daniel, and Paul spoke of as the abomination of desolation. It is an idolatrous image set up in the holy of holies in God’s temple.   15: He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.   The world must worship not the Antichrist but this “image,” Satan may indwell this “image” because we know that due to his great pride he desires much worship."

TrueChristian,3bw0gg,SoCalExile,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced the rider of the white horse in Revelation 6 is a person, while the other three are not, when the description, ""I saw a xxx horse, and the one who rode it...."" is the same for all. So in Rev 6, they are either all persons or all allegories. I believe the latter.   The White horse seems redundant with the red horse considering the popular view that his bow means he will conquer with war. Although, in the apostolic age, the church used the Greek Old Testament, the Septuagint. If you look up the word for ""bow"" here (toxon) in the Septuagint, the first time it is used is Genesis 9, where it used to describe a bow of many colors that appears after a rain, as a sign of the Lord's covenant with the earth. So, it is very possible that the white horse is representative of a covenant, or peace treaty, that will be signed, effectively conquering nations.   Regarding the red horse; the word for ""great"" (megas) in describing his weapon can, and is, also translated as ""loud"". The word translated as ""sword"" (machaira) can metaphorically mean ""a weapon of war, is used for war, or for quarrels and dissensions that destroy peace"". So what if it really meant, ""...and there was given unto him a [loud/great] weapon""? Seems it would apply to the modern world of firearms and nukes; although would have made no sense to translators centuries ago.   The black horse may represent famine induced by a economic collapse; hence the scales. However, the word translated as scales here, zugos is only translated in the NT as ""a pair of scales"" here; every other place it's translated as yoke or a heavy burden as of bondage or servitude. So, to speculate,  what if it's not famine, but a system or law that causes the economy to collapse, or simply the price of food to rise? The most recent system that accomplished this on a regular basis is communism/socialism; although, a more significant recent action was the advent of fiat currency, which is subject to inflation, and the confidence of it's users. Where up until the late 20th century, money was pegged to gold, if not gold itself. So if the red horse has it's way, it's very feasible that war can cause economic troubles that lead to monetary collapse; causing famine.      In Rev. 13, it mentions two ""beasts"". Judging from the Book of Daniel, beasts are always representative of nations or powers, not people. The same goes for the prostitute. While these powers have leaders, and one will commit the 'Abomination of Desolation', i.e. desecration of the Jewish temple, I think we get wrapped around the identity of the anti-christ (even though we won't know who it is until the abomination of desolation), and we lose sight of the overall big picture, which Revelation is conveying to us."

Gay people don't think Christians hate them because they misunderstand the Christian position, they think that position is in and of itself hateful.  The belief that gay relationships are inherently sinful is the part that gay people consider hateful.  They know Christians believe God wants you to believe that, but they don't believe the same things about God - to them, what you believe is full of hate.  These opinion pieces and comics and things on this topic never seem to understand that gay people DO understand what you're saying about sexual sin and all the rest.  It's not really all that complicated, truth be told.  They just a.) disagree and b.) think that your beliefs represent a form of hatred of who they are.

They see the beliefs themselves rooted in hatred of the ""other,"" in this case gay people.  I guess it's just anecdotal.  I've gotta say, I really don't think most gay people have a problem with Christianity, they just don't care about it unless it's directly opposing something that matters to them.  All this stuff about how the ""homosexual agenda"" is going to find new ways to go after Christians is just fearmongering.

Litigation of a small business owner because they said they wouldn't bake for your wedding isn't loving, and some might identify it as malicious.   I am Christian, I believe the Bible is true and inspired by God. I also feel like a government can have a moral standard, even a moral standard based on religion.

Litigation of a small business owner because they said they wouldn't bake for your wedding isn't loving, and some might identify it as malicious.   The entire point of that litigation is that they're a business owner.  Public businesses have to comply with the same set of rules, regardless of the religion of the person who owns them.  This is why people aren't, and won't be, suing churches to force them to be gay wedding venues.  Churches and businesses are different.  There are different rules for them.  If business owners violate the rules of operating a business, it's not a religious issue regardless of their reasons for violating the rules.   From my perspective, there is no difference between a man and a woman who do not believe in the God of the bible getting married or a same sex couple.    Right!  Exactly!  If that's what Christianity's message on the topic had been for the past decade, it would likely be significantly less unpopular right now.  Gay people don't oppose Christianity for the heck of it, they oppose it because it's specifically trying to reduce their agency in their own lives.  Once it isn't doing that (legally speaking, not in terms of belief,) they will go back to not caring about it.  Christianity is not that important to people who aren't Christians unless it's being used against them in the secular world.

Anti-miscegenation churches may be loathsome and bigoted, but they're constitutionally protected.  Anti-SSM churches are in exactly the same boat.   Second, we might see 'hate speech' labels given to biblical references and ultimately, fines or even jail time.   Do you have some specific reason to think that's true, or is it just fearmongering?  The friggin' Klan doesn't face ""fines or even jail time"" for their idiocy, and they're far more hateful and regressive than any SSM opponents ever were.

Tell me, if your son or brother or friend did something that you thought was morally wrong, and you addressed them on it, does that mean you hate them?  To answer your question:   where do you think the perception that Christians are hateful on this issue comes from   I would say two things. First, I'm sure there certainly are Christians  (or at least people who call themselves Christians) out there who are hateful to homosexuals, which is entirely wrong and we as a Church do not condone. People (especially the media) tend to focus on the hateful, vocal minority rather than the peaceful majority. So, if one church in a million takes the stance ""no homosexuals allowed,"" that's what you'll hear about, despite the 999,999 other churches saying ""all are welcome.""   Secondly, if someone is telling us it's wrong to do something we want to do, we might react angrily or interpret it as hate. Much as a child throws a tantrum because his parent won't buy him what he wants, we might do the same to God for not wanting us to sin. However, we need to trust that God knows what's best, and that abstaining from sin will be what is best for us."

Simply put, at the fundamental level, some of the beliefs of Christianity appear hateful to non-Christians.  By fundamental level I mean the words of the Bible itself in this case.  It makes absolutely no difference to them whether Christians believe those ideas are meant lovingly or not; the beliefs in and of themselves represent the position that same-sex relationships are inherently inferior to opposite-sex.  That position is what is hateful - it doesn't matter whether you think it's a matter of morality, or of love, or of justice, or anything else.  It doesn't matter whether you think you're helping someone by telling them those things, no matter how sincere you are.  Much like if the Bible contained an overtly racist passage, the overtly homophobic passages are hatred expressed in the text and taught from the pulpit.  Non-Christians do not believe you that those words come from God, they believe they were made up by ancient people and repeated by modern people to excuse their own prejudices.   I would say two things. First   I agree with your first point almost entirely, in that I think you're right that only a vocal minority of Christians actively hates gay people and that the media is fixated on them.   Secondly, if someone is telling us it's wrong to do something we want to do,   Here's the thing.  It's not that you think it's wrong, it's why you think it's wrong.  Remember - these people are not Christian.  They do not think the Bible is any more special than any other ancient holy book.  They do not care what Christians think God wants.  When Christians form the overwhelming bulk of the opposition to SSM based on the Bible, it is very frustrating for LGBT people who don't follow Christianity and have no reason whatsoever to consider its rules as true or valid.  If the Christian message had been ""we aren't going to participate but we won't try to stop you,"" we wouldn't be having this conversation.  The hateful perception might still be there since the underlying message would still exist, but it would be a shadow of what it is right now."

That position is what is hateful    Again, it seems to me that you define ""hateful"" differently than I do. To me, you must have hate for a person to be hateful. Believing something is wrong that someone else does not believe is wrong is not hate, by any stretch of the definition in my mind.  Another example, Christians believe that viewing pornography is sinful. Does that mean that Christians hate the 90+% of the population that views pornography? Is it that it's impossible to believe that a certain action is wrong without hating the people that perform it, or that are tempted by it?   Non-Christians do not believe you that those words come from God, they believe they were made up by ancient people and repeated by modern people to excuse their own prejudices.   Quite frankly, it is of no concern to Christians whether or not non-Christians believe that Christians' beliefs come from God. We are called to follow scripture, against our biases. You make it sound as though we simply use scripture to back up what we want to believe; I posit that the opposite is true - scripture often tells us things that we do not want to hear, but we are obligated to follow its teaching and ""lean not on our own understanding."""

TrueChristian,3bs990,stillbatting1000,6,Thu Jul 2 05:04:28 2015 UTC,"Such an amazing series. The only thing I don't necessarily agree with Adam on is that he believes Christians shouldn't save money, especially not for retirement.  I agree, a Christian should not stop working in one way or another, but certainly a retirement plan can not only stabilize your life to do more retirement work in a  serving capacity, but it allows you to generate and give more money overall.  I mean, ""do not store up treasures on Earth"" means not to put Earthly things above those things that God has for you... Not to literally not save anything. Although I guess if you're not planning on supporting a family, that can work.  Anyways, sorry to go on a rant. For the grand majority of the time, Adam is spot on theologically, and he's a blessing to the internet--and I mean that completely seriously."
TrueChristian,3bs990,PMMeYourPokemonTeam,5,Wed Jul 1 23:01:15 2015 UTC,"Doesn't he have a point, though? Why save for retirement when we know Jesus is looking out for us:    Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today. (Matthew 6:31-34)   I mean, preparing for retirement seems to be doing all of these things:   Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will wear. (Matthew 6:25)   Isn't establishing a retirement fund precisely because people are worried about their future life and material comfort? Plan now, to have security that we can still eat, drink and keep ourselves clothed and in good health once we are no longer working tomorrow?"
TrueChristian,3bs990,drunkwithblood,13,Thu Jul 2 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the verses you provided, but it's not saying we shouldn't plan for tomorrow. It's saying that we should not worry, and especially not worry about our own selves, what we will drink, eat, wear, etc. To do that is wrong for two reasons, first that it is selfish-thinking, and second, that it inherently involves worrying--another word for lacking trust in God, who has sovereignty in our lives. Planning for retirement should not be about ourselves, our pleasures or our comfort, but about being ready and willing for what God has called us to do--as a Christian should not stop working for and giving their time to God simply because they are ""retired"".  There's a big difference between selfishly worrying about the future (or worrying about anything) and utilizing the power and resources that God has provided us with to further His Kingdom, to spread the Gospel and Good News that He has intrusted us with, as well as (secondarily) to care for those in need.  A great example of how God expects us to invest the things He has given us is found in Matthew 25:14-30, which is the Parable of the Talents (a talent being an ancient unit of money).   For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away.  He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.  Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’  His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’   And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’   His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’   He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’  But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.   As this is a parable, we must draw the conclusion that God is not simply talking about money here, but all the abilities and gifts that He has bestowed on each of us. Those of us who have access to, and the ability to use computers like us likely have been given quite a lot, in both safety, money, and ability/access to schooling, and we are thus expected to use the things God has given us to further His Kingdom and spread the Good News, as well as to care for those who are in need (widows, the poor, etc):   Luke 12:48b - ""Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.""   And besides all of the above, if we are given the gift of monetary finances to take care of ourselves by God, then not doing so with what we are given would be like being bit by a snake, or having a broken bone, but refusing the care of a doctor because ""God will save me"". Yes, He will save us--by using the things He has given us to do so with!  I don't see any difference between not fixing a broken arm by going to the hospital that is readily available to us, and not preparing for the future by using the monetary gifts that God has given to us. Especially knowing how fixing that arm, or preparing for our retirements will allow us to follow God and spread his Good News even further. Of course, as we prepare for retirement, we do not want to say ""Ahh, I can relax now, because the future is set and I am safe in my ways."" As the bible says, we should not boast by claiming we are setting ourselves up for safety in the future:   James 4:13-16 - Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit' yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.' As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.   tl;dr:  -You're right, we should not worry about the future or make our retirements about our own comfort or pleasure  -We should also not retire from giving our time to the Lord. Christians do not stop their God-centered work until the Lord calls us home.  -We should also not begin to trust in our retirement money over God. We should instead remember to say that each new day is the Lord's gift to us, that tomorrow is never certain, no matter how many digits are found in our bank accounts.  -However, Jesus tells us that we should take what we have been given and invest it, money or otherwise, for the purpose of furthering His Kingdom and saving souls. Thus it is my belief that it is not wrong to invest money into retirement, as long as it is done with the correct mindset and it is used correctly when the time comes."

I feel so incredibly dense after reading the Bible and coming online and seeing someone mention something I've read and explain it so simply that I really can't believe it totally went over my head.  I remember reading that parable with the talents and the master and not really understanding it, but it seems so simple a lesson.  And it made me think of a stark point for myself.

TrueChristian,3bs990,PMMeYourPokemonTeam,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:18:25 2015 UTC,"Being worried is not the same as preparing.  The point of these passages is obviously that we should worry more about the kingdom of God than our own personal wealth.   Just read the text and look for the meaning.  I think it is pretty plain.  Buy a book on hermeneutics if you're having trouble figuring out the meaning of passages like this.   A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous. (Proverbs 13:22)   Matthew 25, the parable of the talents makes a positive analogy about investing for future monetary gain.  And in 1 Corinthians Paul writes    ""On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come.""   The Lord is fine with saving and planning finances.  The text seems pretty plain to me.  The love of money and over-concern about money are the evils here, along with lack of trust in God to provide.  Not saving.  I think when you take the Bible as a whole it is hard to make the argument that the Lord doesn't want us to be financially astute and prepared.    Taking three or four verses out of a passage usually does not provide much useful information."
TrueChristian,3bs990,downloadacar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:41:23 2015 UTC,"Taking three or four verses out of a passage usually does not provide much useful information.   Yeah, I definitely agree with you there.  I guess I just find it interesting that some like Adam can read the same verses as you (or anyone else), and come away thinking very differently as to what the ""point"" is. To me, when I read his comic about not saving money, and then the part of the sermon of the mount that I quoted I think: ""Yeah! People should be living radical, Spirit-led lives, freely sharing whatever bounty they have in the present with the poor and less fortunate, secure in the knowledge that God will always provide for them in the future""; but then I read something like what you or the PokemonTeam guy quotes, and I think: ""Yeah, God provides more than enough now, so we can save for when he provides less later"".   Being worried is not the same as preparing.   Yeah, definitely not the same thing. Only one of them is an action. But it seems to me like any preparatory action can only be done in response to a worry about the future? It needn't be a state of anxiety or irrational stress about the future, it could be completely prudent and indeed a legitimate worry; but it must be a sense that if you did not take action now (by preparing), you will be worse later.   Like, I am worried that the sun might burn me, so I apply sunscreen. I am worried that someone might crash into me, so I prepare by wearing my seatbelt. I'm worried about my children getting deadly or debilitating illnesses, so I get them vaccinated. If I never had any worry at all about the potential future consequences why would I ever take preventive measures, and prepare? Saving for retirement does still seem to be similar to me: a prudent action, in response to a legitimate worry (""Who will provide for me, once I am no longer able?""). So I can totally get the alternative Christian perspective when someone like Adam answers that question with: ""God, of course!"" and so gives away any excess he finds himself with to the needy in the present, rather than store it up for the lean times.  It's interesting."

Or by ""supposed to be collected for"" do you mean being spent on things that you believe are outside the domain of the state? Like welfare, if you disagree with socialised welfare.  Either way, I don't see how it matters? Romans was written to the church in Rome, during the time of Nero. Not only was tax money being spent on things the Christians would never benefit from (lavish games, decadent orgies, construction of pagan public buildings), but taxes will have been spent on things that actively harmed them: the cruel and violent persecution of the early church and Christians (Nero burned many), and paying for the upkeep of the Roman occupation of Israel.   Yet even still Paul doesn't call it theft, instead he says these people (including the ruling authorities earlier in Romans 13) have been established by God, and are God's servants...?"

Additionally in the sermon in the amount Jesus reminds his audience not to worry, because God takes care of the birds and the flowers.   Basically, it just seems to me like the whole idea of saving for retirement is to trust in our own ability to take care of ourselves.

Clearly, I think most people would agree (whether they be Christian or not) that there are potential moral or ethical implications to hoarding wealth.

The early church had no personal monies.  ALL goods were sold and the funds donated to the church.  Every member shared everything.  Noone had their own funds.    Jesus' message to followers, over and over, was to not worry at all about what to eat or drink or what to wear.  Jesus' message to us was not to worry at all about our daily requirements.  Jesus' message states that our own diligence (working and serving) and God's grace will provide for our every need.  This is known as faith.

As I said previously, I don't want to necessarily ""trash talk"" the intent of the sentiment. I just think it's one of those things that is less applicable in modern-day society.

Ever since I was a kid I've been painfully shy and growing up I often felt excluded, invisible, and faulty compared to everyone else.  I became very bitter about this over the years and turned to different things to try to help me fit in with others.  It started with clothes and music styles but as I got older became a pursuit of relationships, pornography, and sex.  I took rejection worse than a death in the family and had completely convinced myself that nobody could love or accept me for who I was.  After graduating college I pursued a career in the military, and despite it naturally not being for me I felt I had to succeed.  I had to be more excellent than everyone else or I'd never be noticed.    I have never truly been happy following this path even though I have some great accomplishments under my belt.  What I believe about Christ has been warring against my idolatrous pursuits this whole time, and it's just come to the point where I want to reverse course.  I don't want to worship myself anymore because I make a lousy God and succeed in only making myself miserable and depraved. I want to find a new career where I have followed God's calling and not my selfish ambition.  I want to leave my broken secularist worldview and make loving God and others my worldview.

TrueChristian,3bsgsn,zeta416,7,Wed Jul 1 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"I would like to believe that gay marriage should have already existed. I don't think churches should be obligated to perform gay weddings though.   I do believe that there is a separation of church and state because it seems obvious in the constitution. Some Christians have not really accepted this though. Their only argument seems to be that there is no explicit phrase 'Separation of church and state' which there isn't. But there doesn't need to be one since the idea is evident.   With that foundation, it seems like there shouldn't be a problem when it comes to issues like gay marriage. Not everyone is a Christian. Non Christian homosexual couples were already living together. It's not like if gay marriage was banned forever that the homosexual community would just disappear. They are a part of the country too.   I also take issue with the claims of ""support."" What does that really mean? I don't think I support gay marriage. I don't think a church is obligated to marry homosexuals. This law doesn't mandate that anyway. I just don't think the old situation was feasible or realistic. It was Christians vs homosexuals. How many more decades do you really want to live like that?"

TrueChristian,3bsgsn,underrealized,4,Thu Jul 2 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"A few points that should clear up this issue:   Liberal Christians reject the notion that homosexuality is against the Bible.  They claim they have a better and more godly interpretation of all of those verses than you do.  So, it is in no way contradictory to their faith to support gay marriage. There are some who call themselves conservative and yet still believe homosexuality is not sinful under the scriptures.  So, the same concept still applies. I have never met a person who claims homosexuality is a sin and supports gay marriage in the sense that they are happy and desirous that gays should be able to marry one another.  Rather, their position is generally consistent with the varying passages that it's not our place to judge the world - only those in the church.  So, they get frustrated with judgmental Christians who want to spread hate and condemnation and tell them to back off and let the homosexual community do what they want to do, since it's not for us to judge.  Then they get labeled as homosexual supporters by these overly-judgmental haters purely because they don't take a harsher/more extreme stance. Then there are those who believe it's sinful and believe they have a social obligation to promote godly rules, even over non-believers.  Although they don't realistically expect to win most of they time, they believe that the ""fight"" itself is a means of spreading God's love and redeeming God's creation to him - not just people, but law, politics, morality, etc.  So, they fight a losing battle, but still emphasize their love for those who are on the other end.  This emphasis of love causes those same radical haters to label them ""gay supporters."" Then there's those radical haters.   I'm probably somewhere between 3 and 4, hopping between the two of them at different phases, never quite able to make up my mind as to whether we really have a social obligation to redeem society, versus letting society run its course and focusing on individual people.  My tendency in life is to focus on individual people, but my theological understanding tells me that redeeming more than just people is valuable and desired by God as well."
TrueChristian,3bsgsn,ruizbujc,11,Fri Jul 3 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"In short, yes. The situation we are faced with is tricky because, as Christians, we cannot support gay marriage or the lifestyle that comes along with it. But, we also cannot expect people who are not Christians to make and follow laws that are designed around our beliefs. Many ""Christians"" are fighting for gay marriage because they say it is our ""right"" or something along those lines. But the truth is that it isn't; nothing is our right because we have no rights. We are sinners in a broken world. And that realization is the only way others are going to see what the Bible says about homosexuality as truth."

TrueChristian,3bsgsn,PMMeYourPokemonTeam,3,Wed Jul 1 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"Divorce was allowed by God in Israel because of their ""stubborn hearts"", and it is also allowed in the New Testament if there is unfaithfulness in the marriage. So no, at the very least, I don't think it should be outlawed entirely.  However, assuming no-fault or reasonless divorce was something that from the get-go of the nation was ""outlawed"" (read: not recognized by the government; we're not talking about tracking people down and throwing people in jail here), and people were fighting for it to be recognized, then I probably would not stop them. I would surely not vote for it to be recognized by the government, but I probably wouldn't vote against it, because if there is enough people to vote it in, then it's already a lost cause.  Same thing with the other religions thing. If the country I was living in started out small and grew until people were coming in and being born that wanted to have the government recognize other churches, etc., I wouldn't vote for the government to recognize it, but I wouldn't vote against it either.  Note: There's a huge difference between ""outlawing"" something (track people down and punish them) and having the government ""not recognize"" something. Same-sex couples were not kept from having personal ceremonies in their churches that support same-sex relationships. It's not as if they ""weren't allowed to get married"" in that sense. They wanted government recognition and the equal rights along with it. It wasn't as if they were going to be arrested if they tried to marry in their private church before this past month."

TrueChristian,3bsgsn,g_baptist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"To understand many of our indignation you must look at the history (I think). It is my understanding that marriage licenses became required around the mid 1600s. At that time, marriage was the marriage sacrament being performed in a church. The government was asking for a legally binding contract to show the marriage occurred. So the piece of paper then was a way of showing, yes, we got married and in all cases up until then it was only in the church (again, I'm no expert here but this is what I've read). So you see, the government wanted to start documenting the occurances of our sacrament before God which we call marriage,  and in doing so coopted it to become a legal matter despite it being a church matter and a matter between a man, woman and our God originally (one case where separation of church and state didn't matter I guess... Because taxes). That was the first strike. Over time, they have further deluded our marriage, our sacrament, to a point where now it can be used in such a way as to completely forsake very specific teachings of our scripture. I've long argued that the government taking over our sacrament in the first place is the far greater sin because that is what has allowed all of this, and the coming issues such as polygamy. Civil unions... I could care less if two roommates who commit to living with each other for long periods of time get tax benefits really, as long as it's only one person at a time.  but marriage should never have been a legal matter to begin with, and it wasn't originally."
TrueChristian,3bsgsn,chimneytop,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:17:56 2015 UTC,"Just woke up and sm on my phone  I think your history is missing one major point: legal marriage is and was about property. At first women were property and the gov needed a way to make sure a) familial mergers were formal b) to distinguish fornication from married sex. Today legal marriage is still about property. Marrying comingles assets. Some states view the marriage as a partnership where both spouses are responsible for any income earned and the others think that the less secure spouse becomes entitled to support. So I say again, allowing gay people to commingle assets does not encourage gay sex."
TrueChristian,3bsgsn,g_baptist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was entirely about property given the context in which it first occurred (in Massachusetts I believe) but it's definitely a factor I don't disagree at all. Either way,  that doesn't really have any bearing on my point. It was still government intrusion upon a religious matter (sacrament)  at that time. Unless there was a large occurrence of non-religious marital ceremonies occurring that I'm not aware of, but I find that extremely unlikely."

By the way, in this case, the SCOTUS is not, by any stretch ""making it easier"" to be gay. They have determined that it is unconstitutional to ban two consenting adults from joining in civil contract because their anatomy matches. To rule that something is unconstitutional does not mean that the contrary is morally right, just that the thing that is unconstitutional fundamentally violates the law of the land, which is necessarily inferior to God's law.

TrueChristian,3bsgsn,CantHugEveryCat,3,Wed Jul 1 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"""Legal marriage"" (as such) is a legal framework that alters what life is like for anyone in a committed, monogamous relationship. It allows people in this situation to say, ""I hereby declare this other person is close family, to me, and should be addressed as such from a legal standpoint.""  There are many other forms of this: people can adopt, disown, be emancipated, marry, and divorce. This is legally a ""status change"" and affects a whole host of financial, contractual, and other legal factors.    Even if it weren't being called ""marriage,"" the question is basically, ""Is it right to allow, or right to prevent, adults from mutually declaring familyhood?""    Allowing people to declare this doesn't mean we approve of their relationship or what they're doing in their relationship. For example, I myself probably wouldn't approve of a marriage in which a 20- and 60-year-old got married. But that doesn't mean I'm going to bar them from doing legally declaring/establishing this relationship. Same thing if the couple has bizarre religious beliefs about marriage (such as the wife being spiritually the husband's property or something), this again doesn't mean I'm going to bar them from legal recognition.    In the end, what's really happening is that governmental law is often seen as approval and affirmation when it allows or recognizes something. But really, government action is just about the use of force and the support of contractual agreements. That's what economic law, taxation, public safety, etc. are all about: force/safety and contract/fraud.  We could just as easily say that removing the death penalty from ""acts of sodomy"" is ""approving"" of homosexuality. Isn't that horrific? Saying that something should be kept on the death penalty list because taking it off means you're approving of it?  In the same way, we have legal structures that make life harder for monogamous/committed homosexuals in ways that are induced by those structures. They're not ""intrinsic"" to homosexuality; they aren't ""God's punishment""; they're only present because of how we set up the laws concerning it.  There are many sins that should be illegal, and many that should not. Does this mean they aren't sins? No, but it means persuasion, rather than the force of law, should be the mechanism by which we draw people toward Christ.  That's not approval of sin; it's loving our neighbor as ourselves. I wouldn't want someone else trying to get me to stop, for example, lusting by making it illegal to feel lust. Instead, I'd want them to legally allow me to feel whatever I feel, but gently talk me out of it however they have opportunity to do."

I might be wrong about what I may now type.   Intersex people would only refer to the genitalia of the person. The problem with this is that it would only refer to that specific physical aspect of the person, not the gender or the sexual orientation of themselves. Children who are intersex can have complication with the identity of gender (whether boy or girl). Though practices by psychiatrists can demonstrate by early behaviour (even around 6 months) whether or not the child is a boy or a girl, it usually leads to the removal of the redundant genital. Usually people who are intersex can get married cause there's not sexual orientation or a gender dysphoria condition that is often present within the intersex person."

In addition, scripture doesn't define it's own boundaries, so if one adheres to Sola Scriptura (one of the 5 points of protestantism), each person is free to hold their own, personal canon, since the canon isn't attested to in Scripture. Revelation is a weird book, why not throw it out? Or why not do what Martin Luther wanted to do and throw out Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation?

TrueChristian,3btx63,iwishiwaswise,2,Thu Jul 2 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"Well, the Jewish canon was still open at the time of Christ. Different groups of Jews accepted different sets of books. Greek speaking Jews outside Isreal, which was the majority, used the Septuagint. The Septuagint has the deuterocanonical books. Jesus and His Apostles quoted from the Septuagint. So, the Church used the Septuagint. The Church simply continued to use the Septuagint after the Jews closed their canon.  I wanted to double check my facts on this and came across a really good quote:  ""But remember that by the time the Jewish council of Javneh rolled around, the Catholic Church had been in existence and using the Septuagint Scriptures in its teaching, preaching, and worship for nearly 60 years, just as the Apostles themselves had done. So the Church hardly felt the obligation to conform to the wishes of the rabbis in excluding the deuterocanonical books any more than they felt obliged to follow the rabbis in rejecting the New Testament writings. The fact is that after the birth of the Church on the day of Pentecost, the rabbis no longer had authority from God to settle such issues. That authority, including the authority to define the canon of Scripture, had been given to Christ's Church.""  Note: I am not Catholic, but the Catholics make sense here.

In some cases, this oral history and theology wasn't formally written down for some time. I don't believe this affects the Bible's status as the infallible repository of God's Word.  Also, being forced underground for the first couple hundred years didn't help.  Ultimately, accepting the canon is an act of faith like any other, but we can believe firmly that Christ has built his church upon a rock.  There is only one power in this world that can perfectly protect the purity and inerrancy and truth of scripture, and that is God himself.  Remember that the Word was with God and the Word was God.

Several wildly different sects of Christians developed.  ""His church""? What exactly is ""his church""? How do you define this?  When you look at all these different early Christian groups, how can you tell who was part of ""his church""?   There is only one power in this world that can perfectly protect the purity and inerrancy and truth of scripture, and that is God himself.

The authentic scriptures were passed from the hands of disciples to the early church members as letters and gospels. People would have been saying, with very widespread agreement, things like ""yes, I was there when Paul's servant delivered the letter, and I shook hands with him when he visited,"" or, ""my father was one of the 500 brothers that Jesus visited.""  Also, the early churches were headed up by the Apostles and would have been taught about the scriptures by those who had walked with Jesus.   When the counsels convened to meet and affirm the canon, it was more like just sealing what they already precisely knew. They didn't sit there and say which ones they liked and didn't like, they affirmed what they had been taught and what was true by the stories that confirmed authenticity, handed down by their own lineages, collectively and individually.   When you consider how short of a time it was and how fresh  the writings were, and how many Christians would have seen the authentic ones, it seems hard to doubt the canon."

The people who wrote the Bible as we have come to know it, did so as a reaction to an unauthorized compilation being written at that time. They gathered to decide which scriptures should be in the Bible, and deemed the rest as heresy. Many of these heretic scriptures were destroyed, but some survived, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls.  We should ask ourselves, who were these men who claimed to know the mind of God so intimately that they got to decide what was to be included in the Bible, and what had to burn?"

However (there's always a however, isn't there?), it really should be one of the first things that you get to know about the other person. I've taught young adults for almost 10 years now. One of my favorite ideas is that you should be able to know whether a person is marriage material within 2-3 months. That means you are asking the important questions right up front. Don't wait until you've been dating for 6 months to find out if he goes to church regularly, what he wants to do with his life, what his walk with Jesus (if any) looks like. Wait until you've been dating for about 6 days, or 6 hours.  Of course, you don't have to know everything about a person to know if they are marriable. But there are a few non-negotiables for believers that need to be tackled quickly so that no one is wasting time. Plus, it prevents everyone from letting emotions get too intense, making breakups harder later.  Edit: And just for clarity, I'm certainly not saying that you ought to be ready to get married within a few months. Just that the non-negotiables should be all cleared out of the way within a few months."

My main point here is that how I feel about this topic is that it is very, very wise to be friends with somebody before dating them. Your judgment on a person's true character is extremely biased if you start out dating them (at least that's how I am). You tend to see them with rose-colored glasses on, and miss red flags due to being ran by emotions. I used to say yes to anyone who asked me out on a date! I used to have the mindset that ""well, how else will I get to know them and maybe this will be a learning experience, even if things go haywire"". It surely was a learning experience as I went down some very miserable roads, unequally yoking myself. So I've learned my lesson and I no longer desire a relationship unless I know the man very well, as friends, first. After creating strong bonds with guys who were NOT a right match for me, I am currently extremely burnt out on the ""dating"" scene... and I'm only 22.   Now this is ME. I used to be super emotional and get way to attached way too soon. Others may be able to go on a date with somebody and see the red flags right off rip and decline future advances with no problem.

However, I  think its important to remember. We view it as ""well its a slippery slope, if we allow this"", but biblically, the fact that we are even TALKING about this, shows we are already REALLY far down that ""slope"".   In the bible, widespread sexual sins and idolatry was generally the point where god would just nuke the city (metaphorically, I don't know the exact method used to destroy the cities and/or nation, except in some cases it involved fire). Well, as a nations we already have widespread sexual sin and idolatry. We  may not be bowing down to idols but we are bowing our lves to things other than god. Entertainment, comfort, and greed come to mind.  The truth is, the very fact that we have to talk about homosexual marriage is a sign that we have been sliding down this slope for a long time, and the longer you slide, the faster and harder to stop it gets.

I'm not trying to upset anyone but these topics can be very uncomfortable for some.  With regards to ""the child or brother and sister, but not the beast"" consenting, I will go so far as to say that even with the beast one can make an argument that the animal ""enjoyed"" it or at least ""wasn't harmed by it"". There are cases where animals that have been ""handled"" by humans try to get the event to reoccur.  Back to children. Our society recognizes that in the process of human development, physical, social, mental, etc., there are stages involved.  Normally 18 was considered to be a good average. For certain activities, especially drinking (which can impede the whole rational thought/inhibition/frontal lobe thing) and smoking (a peer pressure motivated activity), the age was raised.  There is however a basic agreement amongst humans that humans mature (at different but comparable rates) and that their decision making abilities are expected to improve with that maturity.  So, what I'm trying to say is that just because a child or children say ""yes"" to something, doesn't mean that they are actually consenting. Adults can be coerced as well, though we expect healthy, well adjusted adults to be able to, at some point, overcome that coercion."

TrueChristian,3bsw87,KarateCowboy,0,Fri Jul 3 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"This is sophistic reasoning. You are pointing out the arbitrary rules we have made with regards to animals. We used to do the same with humans not so long ago.  I've never been to a modern slaughterhouse but I have seen videos and read about them (Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" is a century old example). The animals know something is not right on the line to the abattoir.  Breeding them without consent is an interesting distinction in that in the wild, many times mating and copulation occurs by force or is associated with some violence.  Breeding them on a farm or in a lab, however, is nonconsensual. So is experimenting on them. We accept this nonconsensual intrusion because the work being performed is being done for the greater good of humanity (possibly most life).  This is why there are ethics committees at research facilities and there is a process for approval for research studies.  Interestingly, our directed and artificial breeding of this planet's flora and fauna is evidence that genetics (and possibly natural selection) were discovered by farmers before people of science.  So I do not think that consent is irrelevant. I think it is an essential concept and should be at least one of the factors to consider when discussing these difficult issues."

TrueChristian,3bsw87,KarateCowboy,0,Sat Jul 4 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"Please clarify. How does consent apply ""to this one thing and not the others""? I was trying to point out that consent is an issue with minors (definition of which is somewhat gray but we try to get close to a general age) and animals. (We didn't include mentally or psychologically compromised individuals and others.)   Consent does apply to adult activities, medical procedures, pursuits of danger, etc. Consent cannot apply when the persons involved cannot give said consent.  In the end, it is humans that decide what is moral and immoral. It is the society one lives in that comes to this conclusion (assuming we don't live in a theocracy, dictatorship, or other ""top down"" government).  There were many examples of this varying morality prior to religion destroying the moralities humans had evolved, trying to impose a single morality, a singular world view. Another ""feather in the cap"" of religions.  Hedonism may be simplistic morally, but it is not the end result of a society that is agnostic or atheistic, or even one that staunchly believes in separating religion and state. The fact that religion still claims that morality is one of its great contributions to society gives a telling example of religion's arrogance when its (divine) authority is challenged."

TrueChristian,3br7nt,deadby100cuts,3,Wed Jul 1 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"Occasional Great Works teacher here. Let's look at the classics first.   The Divine Comedy The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer The Pilgrim's Progress The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser (taught for weeks on this monumental work) Paradise Lost by John Milton The Way of a Pilgrim (bonus for being Russian) The Brothers Karamazov Almost anything by George MacDonald (especially Phantastes and Lilith), Flannery O Conner, and Madeleine L’Engle. C.S. Lewis' Till we All Have Faces is very strong and relatively unknown, and Tolkien of course.   A little research to jog my memory produced this:  Chesterton, G.K.  Father Brown Mysteries; The Man Who Was Thursday Dillard, Annie.  Holy the Firm; Pilgrim at Tinker Creek Defoe, Daniel. Robinson Crusoe Calvin Miller, The Singer Trilogy (poetry) Dorothy Sayers (remarkable mysteries) Wangerin, Walter.  The Orphean Passages; Ragman and Other Cries of Faith; The Book of the Dun Cow Charles Williams' has some remarkable prose worth your time Solzhenitsyn of course.  The Shack is post-Christian and not badly written. Not sound in the worldview that's presented and it's intended to give a worldview that is the opinion of the author. But as engaging and emotive as it is dangerous."

TrueChristian,3br7nt,JeremiahKassin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:41:15 2015 UTC,I'd be happy to read it :)
TrueChristian,3br7nt,jakeowens,2,Wed Jul 1 14:44:28 2015 UTC,I'm writing some at the moment.  : )  PM me and I'll send you a proof.  1st draft is complete.
TrueChristian,3br7nt,fairly_forgetful,2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Good Christian fiction is hard to come by. I should know. I'm trying to become a writer. The problem is that Christians, in general, tend toward the concrete rather than the abstract. So, Christian fiction, as a rule, tends not to sell as well. With women, that tendency is slightly diminished, ergo more romance novels. That being said, there are a few thriller writers that aren't bad. Ted Dekker is one. Frank Peretti. And, if you don't mind a Catholic writer, I've really grown to love Dean Koontz. He sells as a mainstream author, but is really good at working Christian themes into his work, and makes clear the hand of God operating in his worlds."
TrueChristian,3br7nt,onemananswerfactory,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"I'm also an aspiring writer, which is part of the reason I posted this thread. I want to see what others have done in the Christian Fiction space.  I know Dekker and Peretti are both fairly popular, but I don't personally enjoy that thriller theme they both write. So I suspect I won't like Koontz's work for the same reason, but I'll give his writing a shot as well.  Thanks for the suggestions."
TrueChristian,3br7nt,onemanandhishat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"I'm frankly bored with Dekker, and could never get into Peretti, but I know a lot of people enjoy them. Koontz is good, though. His work has this theme of unrelenting optimism that makes it hard not to enjoy his books, and he's brilliant at characterization.  Ooh! I thought of another one. Randy Alcorn. Safely Home is great fiction!"
TrueChristian,3br7nt,ruizbujc,2,Wed Jul 1 18:38:19 2015 UTC,"Silence by Shusaku Endo is personally one of my favorites. It is about a Jesuit missionary in Feudal Japan wrestling with the silence of God in the face of persecution. (There's also a movie in the works directed by Martin Scorsese, but there's still time to read it before it comes out!)  The writings of Fyodor Dostoyevsky are extremely reflective of his Christianity. His faith was inseparable from his art. The Brothers Karamazov is often cited as one of the best works of Christian literature.   Francine Rivers wrote a series called Mark of the Lion which are about the early church. I've never read them. My mother loves them. I don't imagine they're free of a romance element, though. (But that's true for much of literature, I suppose.)  East of Eden by John Steinbeck very heavily uses the themes and story structure of Genesis. It's a fantastic book.   The Lord of the Rings trilogy has a lot of Christian themes and allegory reflective of Tolkien's faith.   The movie Ben-Hur is based on a novel of the same name by Lew Wallace. I've never read the novel, but I know the movie is a fantastic story."
TrueChristian,3br7nt,thatrightwinger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look up ""Silence.""  As for Francine Rivers, my wife loves her work. She has the Mark of the Lion series, which I haven't read. I've only read one of her books, ""Redeeming Love,"" and even though it's a romance, it's extremely good."
TrueChristian,3br7nt,JeremiahKassin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"I second all of the Lewis and MacDonald recommendations. A series that comes to mind is the Mark of the Lion trilogy- A Voice in the Wind, An Echo in the Darkness, and As Sure as the Dawn. I really enjoyed those."
TrueChristian,3br7nt,thatrightwinger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:53:23 2015 UTC,"Working on it. Give me about a month, then my book will be on Amazon. Hoping to make it a 3-part series, but Reddit is so distracting I can't finish the first part. But I will."
TrueChristian,3br7nt,mutesa1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:30:53 2015 UTC,"I think someone mentioned it already, but I heartily recommend Pilgrim's Progress. You can read the archaic language of the original, or find a perfectly good modernized version. Makes good use of allegory to portray very honest experiences of faith."
TrueChristian,3br7nt,WiseChoices,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:06:20 2015 UTC,"I write Christian fiction.  I'm not published (yet!), but I'd be happy to share if you're willing to give me some feedback in exchange :)  I believe my Reverie series encompasses exactly what you're looking for.  Here's the blurb I use when querying literary agents, to help you weed it out if it's not something you're interested in:   A devastating plague ravages a far-away planet.  But what does Joel Blue care?  He’s got more important things to think about – like going off to college and creating a new image for himself.  This former dough-boy nerd is on a mission to become the charming, athletic “new Joel.”  But a third, truer identity is thrust upon him when a once deceased priest blesses Joel with the curse of waking up wherever he needs to be, which is rarely where he once was.  Figuring out, where am I? soon becomes as difficult and critical for Joel to answer as: who am I?  Lucia’s Window is a relic enabling one to see through the vastness of space and into the depth of souls; and it seems to be Joel’s best hope for answering these questions and finding his way home.  Faced with the paradox of discerning how a future choice can shape his past, Joel finds that the outcome of his identity crisis may be his only hope of combating a literal evil plague, enabling him to win the heart of a clairvoyant beauty and save a people whose planet’s fate may impact the well-being of Earth.   To be clear, there are 2 books presently written in an anticipated 7-8.  The third is in the outlining phases."
