asmr,3e372j,Griffonry,8,Tue Jul 21 16:40:00 2015 UTC,I remember laughing really hard when the original video came out. Glad to see that they made an Animated Adventure of it lol
asmr,3e372j,Kitten_Esque,7,Tue Jul 21 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"yeah that's totally not disturbing, goddamn ryan and gavin"
asmr,3e372j,Antarioo,6,Tue Jul 21 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"I think Gavin was quite aware if what asmr really is, but the was just playing along :P"
asmr,3e372j,testicle_botfly,3,Tue Jul 21 18:55:54 2015 UTC,"Geoff's family listen to it, and I think Michael knows well about it too."
asmr,3e372j,GilledGiraffe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:19 2015 UTC,Aye he said on a podcast he and Burnie both listen to ar videos.
asmr,3e372j,le-imp,0,Tue Jul 21 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"they know what it is alright, they just had to ridicule it."
asmr,3e372j,Antarioo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:20 2015 UTC,They weren't ridiculing it. They were having a bit of fun

asmr,3e3uaj,bokan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:35 2015 UTC,Love her singing in a bunch of awesome D'n'B songs :)
asmr,3e3uaj,doepi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:46 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what accent this is?  The cadence is really soothing!
asmr,3e0nvl,were_only_human,20,Tue Jul 21 01:27:30 2015 UTC,Oh I didn't know grand illusions was accepted here! I've shared many of the longer grand illusion links that got negative points.   I'm so psyched to see him here upvoted! Good call OP
asmr,3e0nvl,IAmBecomeGay,4,Tue Jul 21 06:15:07 2015 UTC,"Really? there is usually one on the front page of this sub a couple times a week lol. You might just be sharing one that was posted recently. Im pretty upset with his channel's new intro to every video, its so loud that it ruins any relaxation ive reached :("
asmr,3e0nvl,thechet,2,Tue Jul 21 13:26:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah the intro kinda sucks, but oh well"
asmr,3e0nvl,IAmBecomeGay,4,Tue Jul 21 13:28:41 2015 UTC,You could always submit the Youtube time link so that people clicking on your links start the video after the intro.
asmr,3e0nvl,JedNascar,8,Tue Jul 21 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect to, but I watched the whole thing. He has such a nice speaking voice."
asmr,3e0nvl,starlight_chaser,6,Tue Jul 21 05:09:40 2015 UTC,Ditto. He didn't trigger me but he was very calming to listen to.
asmr,3e0nvl,DrZeroH,5,Tue Jul 21 05:21:13 2015 UTC,His entire channel is great. Triggered the hell out of me.
asmr,3e0nvl,Devanismyname,5,Tue Jul 21 07:51:53 2015 UTC,"Older british man... Everyone knows Tim, come on."
asmr,3e0nvl,tiimebomb,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:34 2015 UTC,"I kept feeling like I was listening to John Hammond talk about his flea circus.  ""I got this toy back in 1979, spared no expense"""
asmr,3e0jad,Sweet_irish_whispers,3,Tue Jul 21 00:50:15 2015 UTC,Great video. I really liked it
asmr,3e0jad,Colossus__,3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:40 2015 UTC,Thank you so much
asmr,3e0jad,roflbbq,2,Tue Jul 21 02:41:33 2015 UTC,I finally fixed my audio :D
asmr,3e0jad,septicsmile,2,Tue Jul 21 01:00:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Now I'm reading about etymology, and listening to your whispered short stories in Gaelic"
asmr,3e0jad,CuSetanta,2,Tue Jul 21 03:30:57 2015 UTC,Too cool :D
asmr,3e0jad,dashdanw,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:29 2015 UTC,Very lovely and relaxing. Thanks for posting.

asmr,3e0cor,DaLateDentArthurDent,6,Mon Jul 20 23:56:02 2015 UTC,"Get well soon Heather! Thank you so much for prerecording so many videos, you always take care of your viewers :)  It's weird seeing these in a non-tankobon format. I'm so used to reading manga backwards now. The only japanese comics I have in this format are Dragonball Movie comics...  I fondly remember coming home from school to watch Sailor Moon and Dragonball. Let's see if I can remember what else was on... Conan, Cat's Eye, Digimon, Pokemon, Flint Hammerhead, Nadia secret of Blue Water... Late at night Lupin, Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop...   Good times, good times."
asmr,3e0cor,Droggelbecher,7,Tue Jul 21 08:05:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, when i saw the title I was all and then  the first five minutes had me like, so ill see you guys later  Great stuff heather, I knew she loves sailor moon but I didn't know how much. I hope her recovery is  coming along nice and smooth and thanks for posting OP."
asmr,3e0cor,RandomSnoozyPerson,3,Tue Jul 21 03:50:58 2015 UTC,Welcome back Heather!
asmr,3e0cor,Minifig81,4,Tue Jul 21 05:41:54 2015 UTC,"Sailor.  Fucking.  Moon. Growing up we all used to watch Bleach, One Piece, Dragonball, whatever, and we all used watched Sailor Moon too and no one wanted to admit that but we all did it."
asmr,3dzhsw,thewhispercorner,5,Mon Jul 20 20:07:14 2015 UTC,Just realised I haven't seen much of Hailey on my subscriptions list lately. Stuck between this and Heather Feather to listen to tonight
asmr,3dzhsw,DaLateDentArthurDent,4,Mon Jul 20 23:52:34 2015 UTC,She has a Pusheen plushie.  That is amazing.
asmr,3dzhsw,Skywise87,4,Tue Jul 21 01:04:04 2015 UTC,The audio is fantastic. I wish more people would do post production with their recordings.
asmr,3dzhsw,JazerMedia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:04:06 2015 UTC,This is a good one.
asmr,3dzhsw,lecherous_hump,2,Tue Jul 21 02:05:37 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, around 2:54 there is what sounds like a door being slammed faintly in the background. If you are laying in bed listening to this with headphones, it sort of sounds like someone banged on your front door. Don't get freaked out like I did, it's just the video."
asmr,3dzhsw,wtferret,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:47:40 2015 UTC,Loved the note :-)
asmr,3e3smy,StoneWhisperer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"My third video in my week long special to celebrate the channels 1st birthday. (I forgot to post the 2nd video yesterday and don't want to post more than one per day, so go find it on /r/gamingASMR :) )  Ever wondered if you could get ASMR from the Predator? Only one way to find out...  There's no relaxing what can't be relaxed, no chilling what can't be chilled...."

asmr,3dzupe,TommyTingle,2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"Well, that was different."
asmr,3dzupe,teuast,2,Tue Jul 21 09:30:08 2015 UTC,That was very good.
asmr,3dybfh,aleatoric,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"I love it! The only thing I would change is how loud the wrapper sound are. Other than that, it's perfect."
