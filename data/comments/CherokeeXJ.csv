CherokeeXJ,3e3r4m,ydnolb4,7,Tue Jul 21 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"You it all with the block in the car?   Did you check bottom end gap while you were in there? When I pulled my motor because of piston slap at 201K, the rods were 0.002 over max and mains were right at max. Turned them 10/10.   Did you leave the old cam bearings in as well?"
CherokeeXJ,3e3r4m,Dr201,5,Tue Jul 21 21:16:43 2015 UTC,I have no idea what you just asked Haha
CherokeeXJ,3e3r4m,XFiveOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"To create an oil wedge between the bearings (rods and mains) you have a very small amount of clearance between the inside diameter of the bearing and the outside diameter of the journal. The oil runs inside this area. As the engine wears, clearance increases (mostly from start-up).   For example, the measured allowable clearance (difference in diameter) for the rod bearings to the rod journals is 0.001 to 0.003 inches and for the main bearings to crankshaft is 0.001 to 0.0025 inches with the FSM listing ideal clearance at .002 for both.   When I put a micrometer on my engine, the rods were at 0.005 almost throughout and crankshaft was 0.0025 at bearing 4 out to about 0.004 at bearings 1 and 7 (the front and back of the motor) which is a common pattern for an I6. Since this is out of spec, the crankshaft was turned .010/.010 or the mains and rods were machined down until the journals were exactly .010 in smaller than OEM in diameter and then bearings with a .010 smaller inner diameter are used. This brings the engine back into specs for clearance.  Why does this matter? That clearance is there, and designed to be there, for a specific viscosity and flow rate of oil to maintain that oil wedge as designed. Additionally a lot of engines rely on this clearance being within a known range as it provides support for oil pressure regulation within the motor. As this clearance opens up, it becomes more difficult for the engine to support the oil wedge and more difficult for the engine to support oil pressure. At this point wear accelerates and if the clearance opens up too much you can actually see a failure of the oil film, which is bad.   Now, most jeep motors are never in their lives going to be stressed enough for this to be an issue, but if you're ragging on it the engine that will fail is the one that has a nice top end (with great leak down and compression) and a sloppy bottom end vs an old worn out motor where everything is ... 'well worn'."

CherokeeXJ,3e3r4m,Fallingdamage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"the rod bearings were .002 over max allowable clearance.  Though if you were running a bore that was cut at .002 over maximum you will probably notice some piston slap in a good few engines at startup at least.   The thing didn't actually have piston slap until one day it had it really bad, tore it down, and the skirt came out separate on #1, or at least part of it. Scuffed it a little so I bored it .060 and she's off to the races."

I have held off on posting anything about my new-to-me XJ for a while because I wanted to have some actual substance to add. I bought this 97 Cherokee Sport up in Glendale, AZ back in July 2014, so I've had her for a year now and I made a little album to show what I've done to her so far and what I am working on right now! I hope you enjoy it!   Some info about the little heep, I bought her for 4 grand, she's absolutely rust free with just a tiny little rear main leak that I will fix eventually. The paint on her was trashed from the beginning but everything checked out mechanically and electrically (minus the passenger side door lock) so I was pretty happy with the price. Recently I've started making a few more bucks than I used to, so of course instead of being responsible and investing or whatever I decided to build my jeep the way I've wanted to for a while now!  I just bought my lift kit from Jason at JeepinOutfitters, I went with a RE 3.5"" super-flex and OME nitrocharger sport shocks, I can't wait to install everything. I also sprung for a new tie rod from rough country, a new track bar, front brake lines, and upper control arms all from JeepinOutfitters. Any advice on the install would be greatly appreciated, I've armed myself with knowledge from youtube but you can never get enough pointers.   I still have tires and bumpers and some other stuff on the list but for now I think I have enough on my plate. Thanks for reading my essay, I hope to get some real jeepin done soon!"

CherokeeXJ,3e29y3,spareminuteforworms,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:27 2015 UTC,"I just did the spings on my 01 and it was quite the task getting those bolts out. I am also in Minnesota and they were pretty rusty. I used a breaker bar with about a 2ft extension pole on the end of that to break them free after pb blasting for weeks. I didnt snap either of the nuts free in doing so. The worst part of it all was that after i got the threading out they seized inside the bushings. Took about an hour per bolt to get them out with a lot of prying and hammering. From what ive heard if you have access to a torch that gets hot enough, heat the bolts red hot before wrenching on them and it should make your life easier. As far as if you do break a nut off the only fix i heard of was cutting into the frame and rewelding it from inside"
CherokeeXJ,3e29y3,wbcenturion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:33 2015 UTC,Thanks!  So you could tell the bolt loosed from the nut but the rustyness in the sleeve prevented it from turning? What do you think about what /u/pmurph131 said about cutting the leaf and sleeve off?  Would that seemingly have helped?
CherokeeXJ,3e29y3,wbcenturion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:12 2015 UTC,Once i broke the nut free you could unscrew the bolt pretty easy until the threads got to the inside of the bushing. I considered doind the cutting method mentioned at that point but didnt have a grinder with me at the time. Also i would recommend stopping by fastenal and getting new replacement bolts and nuts if you haven't already and putting some anti sieze on them before you reinstall the new ones in case they have to come out later.
CherokeeXJ,3e29y3,pmurph131,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:27 2015 UTC,Cut the leaf and outer metal bushing sleeve off with a grinder. Use a blade to cut off the rubber part of the bushing. Then find the seam on the inner metal sleeve of the bushing and use an air hammer (or hammer and chisel i guess) to widen the sleeve around the bolt so it can break free. This is the part that's going to freeze around your bolt. A little PB on the inner nut and it won't break.
CherokeeXJ,3e29y3,pmurph131,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice that is a great idea.  Could I use the grinder on the inner sleeve to cut it off, or is there something I'm missing about that part?  I suppose the bolt head would get hit by the grinder?  Otherwise, I've got some already mangled wood chisels I can put to work on it.  Is my thinking correct that this is the hardest bolt to remove during the leaf swap?"
CherokeeXJ,3e29y3,pmurph131,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"I was trying to save and reuse the bolts because they were $7 each or something ridiculous. You also might have trouble getting the grinder onto the inner sleeve without cutting anything else.  And yes, it's the hardest bolt. Although I did break the bolts for the sway bar end links. Oh well, don't need it anyway.    Btw, if you're pressing bushings into the new leaf spring yourself, you can use a 1/2"" threaded rod and 1/2"" floor flanges on either side. Use grade 8 washers and grease the outside of the bushing. It's a real pain in the ass, but it works. Don't forget a BFH for the last couple of mm's."

CherokeeXJ,3dyhoe,xc0z,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"Not always true. This notion has pervaded the community because in the vast majority of AAL usage, it's someone doing an inexpensive lift and they figure they'll slap one into their current pack to get a few inches and call the rear lift done. When it (invariably) rides like shit they then report back on the message boards that AAL's suck. Changing a single aspect of suspension without considering its effect on how the system works as a whole is almost always going to end badly. If you're starting with a leaf pack that's still in good shape, and you manage your shackle angle to account for the fact that you're pulling the leaf eyes closer together by introducing more pack arch with an AAL, there's absolutely no reason for an AAL-based rear lift to ride any worse than a full pack (within reason, there are lifted full leaf packs that are just better engineered and constructed than others, but if you've got a full lift pack then you're not looking at AAL's anyway)"
CherokeeXJ,3dyhoe,ShitOnRickard5,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"If you're starting with a leaf pack that's still in good shape   The majority start with a leaf pack that isn't in good shape. Keep in mind that stock Cherokee springs have very little arch, even new ones: http://www.amazon.com/Dorman-929-301-Leaf-Spring-Cherokee/dp/B005VPS358    Do yourself a favor... Do a experiment and Learn a little. Go dismantle a rear leaf. When you take them apart, they'll all spring apart like they're fighting eachother. They straighten out since none of them have the same arch. your going to put in a AAL with a higher rate that stock. they will fight and press against eachother and ultimately, the AAL will lose.    Adding a leaf that has a higher spring rate/load new/old pack is going to result in a stiffer ride, and faster fatigue on the AAL. Money well wasted since you lose the lift your going for in the long run, and you don't get the spring rate for that nice ride, or the load for carrying all your shit.    But... it comes down to your budget, and how much of a fuck you really give about wasting money - pervasive opinion or not...

Since the unibody framerail is fully boxed, you can't exactly put a wrench on it to keep it from just spinning.   The fix usually involves cutting a part of the unibody framerail. This is not a picture of my vehicle, but I had to do the exact same kind of cut on both sides. http://www.cherokeeforum.com/attachments/f2/3994d1245990528t-snapped-leaf-spring-bolt-pics-how-would-you-remove-imgp4911.jpg Once a window is cut, you can stick an open end wrench up in there and hold the nut to keep it from just spinning forever.   On mine I couldn't get the bolt loose, even with the window cut and a wrench holding the welded nut. I wound up putting a sawzall  between the leaf spring and the unibody framerail so I could cut the bolt. That left me with something like this: http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s265/havensov/My%20Jeep%20XJ/GEDC0259.jpg I then used an air hammer to push the tip of the bolt and the welded nut further inside the unibody framerail just to get it out of the way and make room for a new nut.

CherokeeXJ,3dtxj6,Flowmaster44,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:58:50 2015 UTC,Thanks!
CherokeeXJ,3dtxj6,itravelandwheel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:02:40 2015 UTC,/u/Flowmaster44 is correct. I didn't like having to keep my kick panels off so I used some Molex connectors to have a quick disconnect in the door jamb.   Molex connectors are NOT waterproof so it's not the best for the job. I will upgrade them eventually. They also do not have soldered connections so if they aren't crimped properly they can pull out of the pin crimp.    With some homemade hinges it takes me only a minute to take a door off or put it back on which I frequently do. If the weather is nice I pop off the driver door and put it in the back.

CherokeeXJ,3dueu5,motleyjeep,3,Mon Jul 20 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"It could be an issue of bigtime rust in your cooling system. I had plenty of muddy looking coolant and deposits in my original radiator when I replaced it. I can only assume that junk from the block got into the radiator and dispersed itself throughout the cooling system, coating all of the interior surfaces of the radiator.   I know what you're talking about with the condition of your coolant, its almost oily. Check on your coolant overflow tank to be sure the engine is not consuming coolant. If you have to keep topping off that tank or the interior of the tank looks like its got oil in the bottom of it, you may have a larger issue like a cracked head.   What's making me think it may be a cylinder head is your stating that the vehicle is overheating even after new cooling system parts have been installed. I doubt you're wrecking multiple thermostats, you're probably dealing with a bad head. Remove the cap from the valve cover and use a small flashlight to look around at the head inside the valve cover. You may be able to see a crack. Some people can see the crack that way without actually removing the whole valve cover.   I did a higher capacity radiator in my XJ, new water pump, and new thermostat. The vehicle still overheated and the coolant looked like what you're talking about, brown and almost oily. The oil was in the coolant overflow as well. I've looked no further, but I'm pretty sure mine needs a head. I haven't driven it in months because of the chronic running hot and overheating.   A compression test or even just looking at the spark plugs may be a way to identify an issue with the head or head gasket. The usual place for the 0331 cylinder head to fail is between cylinders 3 and 4."

That sucks man. Some people like to put in radiator flush stuff but I usually just do the whole garden hose trick. Do you think there might still be some residual bad stuff from when your head went bad?   Restoration shops can boil radiators to get all the bad stuff out of them. i don't know if that'd be cost-effective or worth the effort/labor of pulling it out.
CherokeeXJ,3dueu5,Apotropaic_Sphinx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:04 2015 UTC,It's a new radiator. I put it in with the new head. I don't kniw. It probably is just old gunk still in there. I've done like 5 or 6 flushes in the past year though. Figured it'd all be out by now.
CherokeeXJ,3dueu5,Apotropaic_Sphinx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:24:58 2015 UTC,That is so weird. the only other thing i can think of would be a defective hose or just an old hose that's going bad. maybe the hose is depositing junk? some radiator hoses have a coil spring inside of them to keep the curvature of the hose. if that spring has started rusting it may be depositing rust throughout the cooling system. did you flush the heater core when you did the radiator and head? there might be some leftover crap in there. i always flush the heater core with water in both directions to try and loosen up any crap that may be inside.
CherokeeXJ,3dueu5,wbcenturion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"I replaced every hose when I did the head and other cooling parts. I flushed that core back and forth for like an hour.
