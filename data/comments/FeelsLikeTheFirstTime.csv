FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dy0h6,asilly,10,Mon Jul 20 18:05:54 2015 UTC,Why do they jerk their heads around like that?
FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dy0h6,toreachtheapex,14,Mon Jul 20 16:20:35 2015 UTC,They don't have depth perception because the field of vision from each eye barely overlaps. They jerk their head forward and back to simulate having 2 eyes.  Fun fact: the further apart an animal's eyes are the more likely it's a prey animal as opposed to a predator. They've evolved to prioritize seeing threats coming instead of being able to focus on what's in front of them (think of eagles).
FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dy0h6,DrDerpberg,6,Mon Jul 20 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"Also, as I understand it, because they lack the vestibulo-ocular reflex, chickens' eyes don't track objects when their heads move. That's why they keep their heads stationary as much as possible. The jerking motion minimizes the time their head is in motion, during which time they can't keep track of objects they're looking at."

FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dlad3,c010rb1indusa,9,Fri Jul 17 11:05:27 2015 UTC,"Colorblind person here. Colorblindness is more than just confusing colors. Without getting into details or types of colorblindness, we see colors but we have a 'dull' or 'muted' color spectrum. Meaning the transitions from one color to another are difficult to distinguish and bright colors are muted. For me, I see fire-engine/ferrari red as red I don't confuse it with green like I can with burgundy, but it doesn't appear that bright to me, royal blue is just as bright from my POV as fire-engine red.  What these glasses basically do is filter out the wavelengths that colorblind people have trouble with, and as long as your not really really colorblind (there are different types and intensities) these glasses help you distinguish between colors you couldn't before, not necessarily 'see' the colors."

A trained and certified animal behaviorist told me that. Also, when a dog wags its tail hoisted up, but with an irratic sway, or with a stiff tail, it usually means that the dog is irritated or angry. Tail wagging doesn't always mean a happy dog, it just means that the dog is experiencing heightened emotions.  Edit: typo"

The glasses are basically notch filters that block the two areas of the spectrum where the sensitivities of our three cone cell types overlap most strongly. For certain types of color deficiency (there are many different types), this leads to an increased signal separation between the cone cell types and therefore makes some color differences ""pop"". For people with normal vision, it will also inevitably dull some colors, probably mostly yellows and cyans."

FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dg4ow,Bowila,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:47 2015 UTC,A turbo charger increases speed? Horsepower?
FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dg4ow,Peter_Mansbrick,12,Thu Jul 16 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"When you have a turbo, you're shoving a bunch more air into a cylinder than what normally happens. Normally, the cylinder sucks in air, but a turbo FUCKING SHOVES THAT SHIT IN.  Now you have a MAMMOTH AMOUNT OF AIR that demands a MAMMOTH AMOUNT OF FUEL.  WHEN YOU HAVE MAMMOTH AMOUNTS OF FUEL AND AIR you have MAMMOTH AMOUNTS OF   BOOM.  This is where your more power comes from. Shit gets that fucking car going.  This apparatus that MAMMOTH AMOUNTS OF AIR is a turbine, powered by ...another turbine, from the exhaust gases leaving the engine. Think about it, the exhaust is rushing out of the exhaust with some oomph like a MILLION HAIRDRYERS. So, you use some of that energy that would otherwise go into, well, sending gas out the back to power the turbo..which generates more exhaust and it's a vicious cycle."
FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dg4ow,Derkek,3,Thu Jul 16 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"It directly increases airflow into the engine, by adding a turbine or something alike, which in turn will increase the perfomance of the engine. Since it can now cycle quicker as getting air into the cylinder, where it mixes it with gas, is easier. Making this process quicker would in turn make perfomance better, that's at least the logic from what I've figured."
FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dg4ow,Bowila,2,Thu Jul 16 00:46:54 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thanks for the info!
FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,3dg4ow,Peter_Mansbrick,2,Thu Jul 16 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"It uses recycled exhaust gases to power a turbine and force air into the engine, the engine is tuned to run more rich on gas so that the more gas combined with the higher psi of induction (measured by their little light up blue gauge they show at around 16:10ish when the blow off valve first whipples) makes more power.  Gas and air runs a combustion engine.   So simply put, a lot more gas and a lot more fuel equal a lot more power.  The whipple or ""pshewew"" is the blow off valve, a valve in the pipe set to release at a certain amount of pressure because a buildup of pressure is caused by letting off the gas and the throttle body closing, which is no Bueno. Some modern cars have this blow off valve set to redirect air back into the intake.  Also in their video they ""tune"" the engine to run more rich by only plugging one of 2 oxygen sensors in.   Edit: bowila was correct, he just gave it in a simple non car guy version"

If so that's supposed to happen, it's from a blow off valve, when you let off the gas and the turbo is spooling presses builds up between it and the now-closed throttle body, so the blow off valve is a valve between those set to release at a certain amount of pressure.  You usually don't hear this on stock cars because they typically redirect this blow off into the intake or just have a really small turbo"
