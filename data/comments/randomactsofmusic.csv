randomactsofmusic,38qcw5,crashkg,0,Thu Jun 11 14:19:33 2015 UTC,Probably one of the few individuals who picks up a guitar and ear tunes it to get it right instead of to look good.  I can't imagine that thing was in tune before he touched it.
randomactsofmusic,38qcw5,Xeroshifter,5,Sat Jun 6 21:44:46 2015 UTC,You know that when you tune a guitar without a tuner you can just tune it to the previous strings right? Anyone who's played guitar for more than a few weeks can get it right. It won't necessarily be EADGBE but it'll be tuned relative to the first string.
randomactsofmusic,38qcw5,flucksy,2,Tue Jun 9 14:09:14 2015 UTC,"Hell, anyone who's been practicing music can. The first time I picked up guitar I could tune it to the top string by ear because I played sax for 2 years. I'd need a tuner for that one, but I always found out easier."

Its still quite impressive pulling that out impromptu though! :)"
randomactsofmusic,2vmqta,shadow31310,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:55:39 2015 UTC,Pentatonic scale:       A pentatonic scale is a musical scale or mode with five notes per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale and minor scale. Pentatonic scales are very common and are found all over the world. They are divided into those with semitones (hemitonic) and those without (anhemitonic).

It sounded great to me but I thought I heard a few flubs, not being  familiar with the piece or even classical music at all its hard for me to to judge.  And what about her piece, why did the band not come in and follow along, was the tempo off?"
randomactsofmusic,2q9swo,h34th3n,5,Wed Dec 24 17:57:11 2014 UTC,"He's definitely not bad. The song was called Memory from the musical ""Cats."" I've never listened to it before but he has probably been playing around four or five years. Maybe a little less our more. Maybe a little more, enough to be able to joke around and play at the same time while being pretty comfortable. It seemed like he was playing some arpeggios in there to spice it up. Which makes it sounds more complicated. The lady though, ya she definitely hasn't played in a while."
randomactsofmusic,2q9swo,Crookmeister,8,Wed Dec 24 21:07:47 2014 UTC,No way you can play that well after only five years

I'm also a fan of  These United States  Cold War Kids actually have two  I like both of the Zeus performances, which aren't on YouTube I don't think, and it's worth noting anyway that the articles written with the videos are fun, too.  edit: Sophie Hunger is a nice RAOM ... edit: a little more structure"

We liked the massage of what we were doing so we decided to turn it into a video in order to encourage others to possibly do the same.  Before filming we asked ourselves the following question: Can we simply film a person in distress and put it up on the internet, without asking them or knowing their history? Our answer is quite clearly no, which is why we have hired an actor to take on this role.  Please look at our video statement, where we explain our rationale in more detail. If we have hurt or disappointed anyone, we are very sorry. Of course that was not our intention.  We are very serious about our non profit organisation and we have been collecting for some weeks now.

randomactsofmusic,25xnuk,CasaElDiablo,3,Mon May 19 17:17:36 2014 UTC,Why does that make it bad?
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,LazerToothpaste,8,Mon May 19 10:59:11 2014 UTC,"I think you are absolutely right in what you say. I am to blame for the mustard video and I must admit that it was very borderline. The goal of this sub is really for spontaneity. I think that is the word that should be focused on. Unplanned or unforseen is what will make this sub the best it can be. It may not have nearly as much content with those guidelines but the quality will be very high. I will speak with the other mod about this. Maybe in the meantime we should brainstorm tags and macros that will help show what is happening in a particular video so if something like mustard is posted then people will know it's not 100% spontaneous. I think when a person gives an unexpected performance, it could have a place here but I don't think I'd call it random. However, those unexpected videos that bring joy or happy tears are certainly in the realm of the emotions we are trying to elicit in this sub and I would hate to completely discourage that kind of stuff."
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,weighthewedge,3,Mon May 19 11:48:14 2014 UTC,"That would be great.  I'm personally not a big fan of the tagging system, because I feel like it doesn't really decrease the inflow of content that is for example studio recorded. If those attract karma they will still swarm the first page, and could out compete some of the content that is truly spontaneous. I've seen plenty of subs sway away from their core because people upvote things that sound good even if they don't necessarily fit the subreddit. I think I prefer a slightly lower amount of posts with A grade content over a more mixed music scene, because I have /r/Listentothis for ""normal"" music.  With that said, it's up to you mods to decide, I'm just giving you my view of it all."
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,RussianRaccoon,5,Mon May 19 12:45:15 2014 UTC,"I agree completely, after subway sax battle I've been looking for a thread where I could find those instances of completely random human interaction on a wonderful, harmonious level through music.  Its awesome seeing how no matter where we come from, what our beliefs are and where we are going in life, a simple thing like music can bring you together if even for a brief moment.   Moments that are completely unexpected,  Complete strangers being able to pick up on eachother,  A spontaneous display of talent and human connection,  Thats what I want to see in this sub."
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,Evsie,3,Mon May 19 11:22:05 2014 UTC,"And the great thing is that I think there is tons and tons of that type of content out there ready to be posted, since the first reaction of everyone who see something like that is to start filming it."
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,GoiterFlop,3,Mon May 19 11:32:20 2014 UTC,"And the great thing is that I think there is tons and tons of that type of content out there ready to be posted   Is there though? I don't think it happens enough to keep up a constant stream of new content, which is a worry as I like the potential of this sub."
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,Kruzifuxen,2,Mon May 19 16:34:02 2014 UTC,"I think so, I mean I've seen jam sessions pop up quite a few times, so if it happens as often for you guys as for me then I don't think this will be a problem.   I think it's more a question about where to find them, because even if people upload their videos they probably don't expect them attract much attention for the most part. So I'm thinking most of the videos would be on Facebook or maybe as a Youtube video with just a few view, because they aren't properly advertised for lack of a better word.  But I've seen loads of the subway singing type of videos from before, that have gained traction, and anything involving famous people would be easy to find. That just leaves the regular jam where the crowd would be smaller, but I feel like that would sort itself out. Especially if there are a lot of subscribers and contributors because of the amount of internet that the collective we roam through each day."
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,nouwsh,6,Mon May 19 16:51:17 2014 UTC,"I love the idea of this sub and came here for videos like three random guys jamming out of no where   I 100% agree with the direction you are going with this. I feel as though the Music showcased here should show the collaboration and social glue that random off the cuff jams can create... thats what really gives me the goosebumps out of most of the videos. I feel as though Random Acts of Music is a great name for the sub but if we had more room we should really call it  something along the lines of ""People coming together over spontaneous music""  The only guidelines I would really like to see is to make a rule where the music has to be generally spotanteous and less produced but I am open to others opinions"
randomactsofmusic,25xkxo,Nun_Cankle,3,Mon May 19 13:23:44 2014 UTC,"Exactly as you say i think there has already been too many videos not being spontaneus nor ""random"" people have started posting studio records which sid a shame.

For the Aquarium and Zombie games that I wrote for, I thought about the tropes/cliches you normally hear in something like that. I approached the aquarium tune with latin rhythms and and mallet percussion, and just kind of ran from there. In the case of the documentary music, the filmmaker actually sent me an example of what he wanted to hear, so I just tried to emulate that. For the art pieces like Kickball or Heatdeath/Entropy, I'm usually just playing around with different techniques/styles to get a feel for how they work."

randomactsofmusic,25tfnq,weighthewedge,4,Sat May 17 21:12:31 2014 UTC,Probably my favorite musical video out there. Everybody's so happy!
randomactsofmusic,25tfnq,MrDrumline,1 point,Sat May 17 21:23:57 2014 UTC,This is absolutely amazing. To see the unadulterated joy and emotion of the face of every single person there.  There are probably four generations of people there - every single one just frozen in a moment of sheer awe and amazement.   First class.
