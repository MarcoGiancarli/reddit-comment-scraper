Considered a problem related to delinquency in youth, it is a form of sexual aggression that ranges in severity from sexually suggestive remarks, brushing in public places and catcalls to groping. Some non-governmental organisations have suggested that the expression be replaced by a more appropriate term. According to them, considering the semantic roots of the term in Indian English, Eve teasing refers to the temptress nature of Eve, placing responsibility on the woman as a tease."

whiteknighting,3brc1x,P4WZ,29,Wed Jul 1 15:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, I couldn't help but post on this guys comment.  Don't get me wrong, I don't feel the need to say ""omg i would fapfapfap to this"" when I see a cosplay of an attractive woman.  That being said, I also am an adult who understands the concept that a pretty woman who repeatedly has herself photographed wearing revealing/form fitting/sexy outfits of video game characters probably WANTS TO BE LOOKED AT.  Point being, if she had no desire to be sexualized then I think she'd either not be having tons of pictures of herself in sexualized poses and clothing on the internet or she'd post these pictures wearing very tame/conservative garb that didn't hug every curve of her body...."
whiteknighting,3brc1x,jaheiner,18,Wed Jul 1 16:33:04 2015 UTC,"they would say that you are victim blaming, and your patriarchy is the reason you think her choice of clothing is responsible for your thoughts. thoughts that they don't want you to have  of course this is what the fat unattractive girls and white knights will say, the girl taking the picture knows and wants you to look obviously"
whiteknighting,3brc1x,68461674897051454980,16,Wed Jul 1 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"Thats the shit that drives me nuts though.  By calling someone a victim you are basically telling them they are too weak to make a choice for themselves.  If I was in the shoes of a female who they said that to it'd be fucking insulting.  It just blows me away that ""feminists"" think the best way to empower women is by making them victims all the fucking time.  How about you consider the posibility that strong independent women (which you try to claim you are) are capable of making adult fucking decisions for themselves and don't need you to tell them they are a victim.  Victims are people forced into a situation by the actions of others or in some cases by simple bad freaking luck.    She'd be a victim if she took the photos to share with a partner or some friends and they betrayed that trust by sharing it with the world.  She's not a victim when she's a well known cos player who puts on sexy clothing to show off her physique on a forum filled with men she knows are going to find her attractive.  Good god these people baffle my mind with how incapable they are of seeing their own fucking hypocrisy that it drives me crazy."
whiteknighting,3brc1x,jaheiner,8,Wed Jul 1 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"It just blows me away that ""feminists""    its not even feminists anymore. its any minority group. i was talking with some minorities, and being one myself and living in the exact same area as them, i would have thought 'racism' wouldnt even be an issues because i have never had any problem with it and i've gone to literally the same schools and other places as these people. yet they all complained about constant racism, i was like 'wtf?'  or blacks, or gays, etc. it seems in western culture the cool thing is to find what crybaby group you fit in to, and blame anything that happens in your life or any shortcomings 100% on ______ (whatever your crybaby thing is)"
whiteknighting,3brc1x,68461674897051454980,3,Thu Jul 2 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the difference. She is clearly showing off what she's got and I don't blame her. If I looked like her I would be showing off too. The problem is that wanting to be sexy is now a ""crime"" In the eyes of feminism now. Oh you can't be for equality of you actually want to be looked at like you're sexy! How dare you objectify yourself?! I mean yeah the ""I'm gonna fap to you"" comments are pretty repulsive in my opinion (if you're gonna masturbate to me go for it, but I'd rather not know unless we're sexually involved) but hey!

whiteknighting,3brc1x,Radical_sabbatical,7,Wed Jul 1 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly part of me that laughs at white knighting stuff comes from some personal experience on the matter.  Not to the level of tipping fedoras but still pretty bad.  I had a habit in my early 20's of going after women that were pretty emotionally busted.  I ended up being the ""best friend"" that was just hoping they'd look past me being overweight and see what a wonder guy i was!  They were nice girls but I was broken as fuck inside too.  I hid from that brokenness by trying to fix other peoples.  This shit goes beyond just being sad from an irrational standpoint.  In some/many cases I'm willing to bet it's much like I was.  You are fucked up but if you're saving someone else then you must not be that bad!  I got my shit together, got some self respect and dropped the excess weight.  Got a career, got in shape and ended up married to a beautiful woman that truthfully would have probably never given me a second look as I was before lol..."

You've locked on to this idea that you must save her life when that is not at all what is happening in reality.  It makes me sick to see you suffering so much for what you perceive to be a noble goal. Your good nature is being perverted.  I really think that you should get into therapy yourself, so that you can hear sensible advice from someone you can respect, not just faceless people online. I think a professional could guide you into the areas that ave been blacked out.  Someone IRL needs to pat you on the back and let you forgive yourself and live again.   At the very least a therapist will tell you coping strategies for stress, so that two corpses aren't created from this mess.  Finally, I recommend to you the writings of Mother Theresa, famous for taking care of the sick. Even she understood the need for self care. She and her orderlies would drop what they were doing completely when the bell rang, reminding them to self care.  Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm."

Do yourself a favor: Read up a lot on men and women who have escaped abusive relationships and their experiences. This is how almost all of them begin: ""But he was so nice at first! I don't know what happened, but it's obviously me fault somehow, etce, etc""  It was all a lie. All of it. Every single moment was a fucking falsehood. No one who is actually sweet and kind will deliberately torture their spouse by taunting them with ""I could kill myself at any time, could be when you get home from work tomorrow."" You've said yourself that she's highly intelligent and has vast knowledge of psychology. This means that she knows exactly how horribly cruel saying something like that is, and that she could lie much, much more effectively than most people. It also means that she knows full well that her behavior is not acceptable and continues anyway. She's manipulating you and you refuse to see it. She will destroy your life for her own gain with no more regret than she has already shown for any of her previous actions.  Get help, get out."

Social messiah complex? Broken childhood? I want to know, because your whole post was about her, nothing about you.  The problem lies with you, man. You've become a victim of a predator because YOU made YOURSELF into prey.  Dump her fat ass, go see a therapist, and make yourself mentally strong.

whiteknighting,3bbaj2,Cycloheptadienyl,-15,Sat Jun 27 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"That's a surprisingly tricky question. I guess a lot of things fall under ""being a dick"", to me - in this case, I think saying things to people that you KNOW are just going to make people mad. You could make the case that they aren't trying to be dicks here, that they think everyone will appreciate the satire - but you can see that they know some people don't recognise the satire, and they're still saying stuff for the sake of angering them. (It would be a bit weird to come out in the middle of the act and remind people it's satire, though.)  I guess shouting at people in a megaphone that I want equality, but that all women should die, is sort of a dick thing to do? Not so much a dick thing if it's with an audience that will recognise it as satire."
whiteknighting,3bbaj2,wasniahC,13,Sat Jun 27 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"So blatantly, painfully obvious satire that only true idiots would take seriously is dickish to you.

But I think it's pretty naive to assume that things like the fedora-wearing-niceguy stereotype, or the hateful things radfems say on twitter/tumblr, are common knowledge. Believe it or not, there's quite a lot of people who don't spend a lot of time online, and a lot who do that only really go on facebook or look at youtube videos.  But I guess anyone who just doesn't know the context for the satire is just a person who isn't mentally well-adjusted and can't take jokes, and therefore whether or not they get it or not doesn't matter? Ok."
whiteknighting,3bbaj2,wasniahC,9,Sat Jun 27 19:43:32 2015 UTC,So your point is because of the possibility that someone out there won't understand the joke the dude's doing the joke are dicks?

Or is that sort of thing seriously a common thing that the average person walking out and about has knowledge on, and I'm just underestimating that? I'd guess at least that less than half of average people would get the context, and there's certainly people there who aren't getting it.  Making this sort of joke and and this sort of satire isn't a dickish thing at all, but shouting it on a loudspeaker to the general public when it could be understood to be really hateful and offensive to people who don't get the fairly specific context? I'm pretty surprised that nobody else sees anything even slightly dickish about this."

This happens often, it's done by muggers so they can take your wallet and phone and whatever when you're passed out.  This is also why the hysteria over Rohypnol is so stupid. It's just a benzo. You can spike a drink with any benzo and it has the same effect. Valium, Xanax, Kpins, whatever. All very easy to obtain.  There's reason for everyone to watch their drinks."
whiteknighting,3bbd35,gatorhound,2,Sat Jun 27 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"It's true that it is a benzodiazepine.  However, it is unique. So unique its illegal in US.  It is very rapidly acting but has a very long half-life (around 24 hrs).  It's also an extremely powerful amnesiac.  Producing retrograde and anterograde amnesia.  Means you don't remember shit before taking it or after. No other benzo has this combination.  It is the perfect (bad word to use) date rape drug.  FDA said no medical value - ""banned"" in Reddit speak."
whiteknighting,3bbd35,dispensation,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"It's a very strong benzo but it's not the only one with the qualities you've listed. Midazolam is a very strong sedative and amnesiac and nitrazepam is another just as strong sedative. The latter has the same type of half-life even. And any benzo will wipe your memory if taken in a high enough dose, especially when mixed with alcohol.  The ones that are often used for those type of crimes around here the RC ones like etizolam because they're legal so easy and cheap to obtain. You can literally just order them online.  For example look up flubromazolam. That shit will knock you out even without alcohol in doses of only 0.25mg. It lasts about 24 hours and it will fuck your memory up. You can just order it on a regular website, get it sent you to tomorrow.  As far as rape in particular goes though, benzos in general (Rohypnol or otherwise) were never widely used in the first place. There were a few isolated cases involving Rohypnol that the media blew out of proportion. The most common date rape drug is just more alcohol. It's much easier and subtler to spike someone's drink with a vodka shot than it is to dissolve a pill in it.  Of course now that hysteria is out there, the wrong people who are now more aware of the effectiveness of benzos for this type of use.  Very low barrier to entry for this kind of crap. Just be watching your drink."
whiteknighting,3bbd35,gatorhound,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up. Fortunately I drink at home.  If someone drugs me, I know its.my gf.   I heard you could buy Roofies in Mexico and Nitrazepam is C1 here and Canada. Clonazepam is related to them.  And yeah midazolam is our amnesiac.  I got that and fentanyl before my upper GI.  I didn't remember a damn thing. The thing with it is it doesn't last long.  I've never heard of of flubromazapam.  I'll check that out.  I was always unsure of legit that online stuff.  And definitely not legal (on our side of border anyway).  I just picture a warehouse full of Mexicans cranking that shit out. Doubt there is much QC.    You're right about the percentage of roofie related drugging.  In school, I remember they said like 1%.  Alcohol is probably 98% the cause of most date rapes.  Thanks for the info."
whiteknighting,3bbd35,dispensation,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:05:24 2015 UTC,"No problem.  Flubromazepam and flubromazolam are two different things, easy to get that confused. But the pam version has a ridiculous half-life, like 300 hours or something. Not as strong (still potent, just not as potent) but it's a lot more practical. It's similar to diazepam in a way.  It's all legit, it comes from factories in China mostly. If you're in the US these RC benzos are all legal. Etizolam is the most popular because it's similar to Xanax. Although etizolam is also a prescription drug in India so a lot of it comes from there too.   You're right about the percentage of roofie related drugging. In school, I remember they said like 1%. Alcohol is probably 98% the cause of most date rapes.   Glad they're telling you this, it's important to know. Roofie hysteria has people on the lookout for the wrong thing. Alcohol is already a pretty reliable date rape drug."
whiteknighting,3bbd35,gatorhound,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:56:40 2015 UTC,"I just read where the -olam is structurally similar to triazolam (Halcyion).  Nobody uses that anymore.  The media went nuts with that in the 90s.  Talk about hysteria. It is a hypnotic. People getting into wrecks the next morning, doing dumb shit, had a massive ""hangover"" effect.  Basically, same deal Ambien has been getting. Halcyion is a great name for a benzo though  I hope people know what they're doing with this stuff. Drinking with these drugs wouldn't be a good idea.  It's hard enough keeping up with the legit stuff.  No way with all this designer and research chemicals."
whiteknighting,3bbd35,dispensation,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:13:17 2015 UTC,"Any benzo ending in -olam has a triazolo ring. Alprazolam, midazolam, etizolam, etc.  The current trend for designer benzos is putting a triazolo ring on everything. They already have clonazolam which, as the name suggests, is triazolo clonazepam and it's basically pure blackout pills. 0.5mg is enough to fuck you up. You won't sleep, you just walk around like a zombie with no recollection of what happened the next day, same stuff clonazepam is famous for, it just does it at way lower doses.  Flubromazolam in particular is a pretty scary one considering what a strong sedative it is but it's nothing compared to what the labs are pumping out next. They are soon selling nitrazolam and, you guessed it, flunitrazolam. Triazolo Rohypnol. I am completely against this kind of thing to be honest but it's supply and demand. Apparently Rohypnol is meant to be very recreational so I might give it a go assuming my name won't end up on some list."

Either you think everyone should be taught not to rape others, or no one should, but what you say means teaching men not to rape (which is nearly universally forbidden) )is a bad thing. Unless you have any constructive addition, what you're saying is that teaching men not to respect laws regarding consent is bad.

It would be different if she was screaming in agony, despair, or out of madness but no, she just sounds like a mentally challenged person.   That is what boggles me. If it was a piece where she defined the depravity or despair of the human mind and the deafening waves of thoughts of madness; then I would think it was an amazing thoughtful analysis. But no, its this adult toddler who thinks that every noise they make is some masterpiece into the human mind without even explaining it. At least, wade into a concept with your audience and let them swim and digest your piece. You don't throw shit on the wall and expect the infinite concepts people think of it to invigorate it, that would be too generic (even if this is how many avant-garde pieces got away with it).  The problem is that Lennon gave her a legacy to stand on. I've seen some awful artists get awy with almost anything because their name has strength or because they are/were affiliated with something. If this was some start-up artist from Ocean Beach you would think, 'who invited this psycho in from their street corner gig?' But since its Yoko Ono, people either give a pass to this or think that it is a breakthrough that their tiny minds cannot handle."
whiteknighting,3b00dt,theaviationhistorian,2,Thu Jun 25 19:43:15 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's only because it's Yoko that people will defend such an embarrassingly awful performance such as that.

And you could say fuck it, assimilation of all, but she squirrels out through various parts of her howls to think this is some sort of melody.   At best, you could argue that the art piece is one dedicated to navigating wading through the mind of someone suffering from a severe psychosis, but I know Yoko wouldn't like that."

whiteknighting,3arbwd,duffmanhb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"Testosterone can. But that's just WHILE you're on it. That's because there is no need to naturally produce it when you have 5x the normal level in your body anyways. Once you get off, you're fine. And there are very rare cases where it's permanent. But that just requires a 15 dollar shot of something else, and the hormone system that's been effected, essentially hits the restart switch, and you're back to normal."

whiteknighting,3arbwd,duffmanhb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:45:19 2015 UTC,"It is pretty harmless, especially testosterone. However, just like you, there is a TON of misconceptions about it, so people are afraid of it. And people find it especially scary, because it reminds them of hard drugs like heroine, which involves a needle. But realistically, the side effects are, if you are prone to balding, you'll bald a bit while using it, same with acne, and temporary small balls. It also does some work on red blood cells, and blood in general after long uses, but that's easily mitigated.   And you'd be surprised how many people DO use it. Just about ALL professional athletes are on full blown cocktails, some of which are legitimately scary. And many of the people at your gym are using it as well, but you just don't realize it, because not everyone is using it to look like the hulk. Many use it for athletic reasons, while others for speeding up gains, and holding muscle mass while they cut. Many of the people that go to the gym, who you think are just natural and work out a lot, with great genetics, are actually using. It's far more common than most realize. Go to a darknetmarket if you want firsthand proof. Steroids are the second most sold thing, right underneath weed.

A lot happens out there or has happened that doesn't make the media. Honestly me and my friends often say the quote of woman of in the military is ""hey we want to be treated as equals... Except for the following instances"""
whiteknighting,3am056,McWeaksauce91,10,Mon Jun 22 08:08:30 2015 UTC,"Having women on the frontlines (unless they're in all female squads, maybe) is a fucking bad idea. What happens if you get shot in the open but your female squad mate can't drag you behind cover because she's a woman? Or what if she gets injured in a firefight and your particularly white-knighty squad members decide she needs help immediately and jeopardize the entire squad?  Edit: also, could a woman carry as much gear as her male counterparts?"
whiteknighting,3am056,Tom_The_Human,5,Mon Jun 22 10:51:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah man,  you'll get a lot of flak for this but I agree with you.   Sure some women will be the Brienne of Tarth type and I'm sure would be an asset,  but as a whole they're probably a detriment on the Frontline.   I do wonder how many white knights there are in the military?  Is it a lot?  I bet it's a lot."

whiteknighting,3am056,Reddit_is_my_Home,-4,Tue Jun 30 09:04:16 2015 UTC,"My mother is military. Most women can meet the requirements to match a man, most just aren't willing to put the work in. It's cultural, you wouldn't believe all the misconceptions spread about women's fitness."
whiteknighting,3am056,Apocalypticoreo,6,Mon Jun 22 15:14:08 2015 UTC,I can and do. I am not belittling your mom or any woman who have been in the military. What im saying is there's a lot of women who demand to be in the actual shit but can't do the shit required to be there. Also there a ton of physical limitations for women. I'm 185 pounds. With full gear on I could weigh up to 220 pound. Do you expect your mother or any female whose 140 pounds at MAX(possibly 160 remember the military has weight and body fat and physical standards) to lift 220 pounds of dead weight if someone goes down? Have you ever lifted dead human weight? It's nothing like weight lifting.   Again im not battling that there aren't some mentally and physically tough women out there. What im talking about is my own personal experience
whiteknighting,3am056,McWeaksauce91,-2,Mon Jun 22 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt she could in her prime, she spend her last few years as a cosy officer before retiring.   As for dead human weight, that's fair, I know 220 not too hard to squat but a barbell is not a body. Still, woman at my gym can lift far about even that. So it annoys me saying that woman shouldn't be allowed on the frontline. If they can meet the requirement in training, they should get in.   No changing the requirements though, as you could make yourself a liability to your brothers and sisters in arms. I recall of a story of an overweight man complaining he couldn't get in because of his weight. It's the same thing in reverse, no soldier could lift him if he got shot, so he would be a liability, same if you're too weak."
whiteknighting,3am056,Apocalypticoreo,5,Mon Jun 22 15:51:47 2015 UTC,"agreed. From personal experience if your fat/out of shape you wont hack it and they'll put you somewhere you wont hurt anyone. Listen if you can cut it and you can meet the standards I completelyyyyy agree with you. The problem is,in my experience,  is that its very rare and usually the mass of women don't or want things altercated. My original point is if you want to talk shit like a man to a man maybe... you shouldn't be surprised when you get hit like a man.   I would like to say again that I do not wish to belittle your mother or any women in the service who actually do the right thing. Its just usually not the case"

whiteknighting,3am056,Apocalypticoreo,3,Mon Jun 22 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"We got you.  My mother was in the military too. She wasn't on the Frontlines like my dad,  but she could run the Shit outta a med station.  She knew her place wasn't fighting in the Shit.  And that's ok.  The problem comes with women who want to be there because of equality,  but can't actually hack it.   That is what it boils down to.  And it goes the same for men.   And dead lifting 220lbs in the gym is hard enough I couldn't imagine that being a limp body."

She told me growing up straight out that if you don't hit a ANYONE, but if a woman hit's you she's given up her right to not be hit and I'm 100% allowed to defend myself.  Giving someone a pass to be an obnoxious asshole because of the type of reproductive organs they happened to be born with is fucking stupid.    If you're excuse is that men shouldn't hit because they are stronger, here's a crazy fucking idea...DON'T FUCKING HIT SOMEONE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HIT BACK BY.    If I hit someone, as far as I'm concerned I've accepted the possibility that there will be repercussions for that.  Being held accountable for your fucking actions as an adult shouldn't be something that only happens if you have a penis.

So if I understand correctly, if a girl agrees to have sex while drunk, that doesn't count? If one were to kill someone driving or gamble away all their money while drunk, then they are still responsible for their actions. Alcohol is not an alibi.  If feminism is searching for gender equality, then it should advocate that women be held responsible for their consent while drunk just as abusive husbands and fathers are not forgiven for household violence due to bring drunk.  These feminists should be adult enough to recognise that drinking to the point that your decision making is impaired is not a good idea, and to accept the consequences of getting that intoxicated.  Alcohol is not a get out of trouble free card. It never has been, and it never should be."

You overestimate how likely it is that someone wants to go to the police after a rape. Especially when they lack solid evidence of the crime.   i.e., not the entire male population.   I heard no one in this video saying ""the entire male population"" are rapists.

That there is some media being beamed into men's heads telling them to rape and with frequency. No. No. There are rapists, just as there are murderers, forgerers, extortionists, maniacs, ne'er-do-wells, etc. Is there a culture that fortifies them? Or is it instead that being bad and being good is part of the human condition?"

The term ""rape culture"" refers to that part of the culture that reinforces an inclination to rape specifically. There may be corresponding ""cultures"" for other immoral acts, but fortunately or unfortunately they haven't yet been labeled as such.  As for rape culture, Revenge of the Nerds has a scene where one of the characters puts on the Darth Vader mask that a lady's boyfriend was wearing previously in order to trick her into having sex. He's such a good lay that she falls in love with him and dumps her boyfriend. Most people today would consider that rape, but the film glorifies it. Just one example, but it's not like there's zero evidence that rape has been enabled or encouraged in the West."
whiteknighting,39pzpa,nate263,7,Sun Jun 14 05:59:38 2015 UTC,"I would argue that society more than culture itself plays a greater part in influencing behaviour. Going back to my original comment, civilised society abhors a rapist. Rapists cannot flourish in this kind of society. Therefore, there cannot be a culture of rape when the majority sets laws to deny that behaviour.  If we're going to talk film, do gore films celebrate violence, molding us into serial killers? Do crime flicks hold the gangster in high regard and with every release driving higher crime rates? Or are they instead just a medium for creative expression? Can't a thing just be a thing without needing to attach some imagined subtext?"
whiteknighting,39pzpa,lockeybc,-5,Sun Jun 14 06:10:12 2015 UTC,"Rapists cannot flourish in this kind of society.   Yeah, like that rapist Bill Cosby who's rotting in prison. Oh wait.   Dude got the benefit of the doubt for a decade in the media after the first allegations (which came out in 2005 and didn't seem to be an issue till last year).   Cosby is still rich and comfortable, and more importantly still has his defenders, including a guy I know personally. Even if you don't buy that prominent films have suggested rape is acceptable, Cosby's lengthy career wouldn't have been possible without an enabling culture that victims were afraid to confront. Hell, Cosby was able to joke about it with Larry King."

Is this proof enough to you that there is a culture of rape? Does it take so little to make a point?  For whatever reason (self-preservation, money, anonymity, banished to Mars), Cosby's accusers sat on their accusations, letting time heal ""wounds"" rather than a judge. We weren't in the bedrooms or casting couches with Cosby and his women, and yet, the public have already formed their opinions of him and labeled Cosby a rapist. He's been shamed and condemned already and may soon be off to prison. If he were cleared tomorrow of all charges, his professional and personal life is in ruins. Even in your own example, you fail to present evidence of a culture of rape.  There is a culture of celebrity, to be sure. That's why you have people like that guy you personally know dote on an accused rapist.  There is a culture of status, secret hush-hush Hollywood culture that we normal people will never quite understand...but a culture of rape? Do you honestly think this?"

The point is he literally got away with it for decades, not that he committed the acts in the first place. If he'd gone straight to prison after the first incident, I'd agree with you.   We weren't in the bedrooms or casting couches with Cosby and his women, and yet, the public have already formed their opinions of him and labeled Cosby a rapist.   Already formed? Come on. ~40 different victims have come forward and you think this is a rush to judgment?  And the public hasn't personally witnessed almost any crime not committed on camera. If that's your standard, there's a ton of serial killers and crooks who should be given the benefit of the doubt by the public.   He's been shamed and condemned already and may soon be off to prison. If he were cleared tomorrow of all charges, his professional and personal life is in ruins.   Yes, but the allegations in 2005, by 5 separate victims, were public for a decade and he got deals for new stand up specials and sell-out crowds during that time. The media didn't acknowledge it really until Hannibal Burress brought it up, and again it took a decade for us to get there. Without Burress, Cosby probably would have been dead before we talked about it, if ever. And the chances are bad even still that he'll spend a day in prison.   a culture of rape? Do you honestly think this?   Raping your spouse wasn't illegal in all 50 states until 1993. So yes - shockingly - I believe we have a culture that is overly permissive toward rape."

He literally got away with it, whatever it is, because his accusers did not go to police. In the face of an absence of concrete proof, what do you want the authorities to do? Invent witnesses? Manufacture evidence?  Yes, I say already formed. Has Cosby been formally charged with anything? Yet, in the court of public opinion, he is as good as guilty and based on what? Reports from the media? Does it not take a little more than that to convict a man in this day and age?  The public doesn't ultimately decide who's guilty and who's not. That's for the courts (juries) and judges to decide. I'm not so quick to sharpen my pitchfork over hearsay like you may be.  Yes, and interracial marriage, sodomy and imbibing alcohol was, too, criminal at one point. Times change. Progress, however slowly, happens. You're grasping here and your biases won't permit you to see that if you were to blindly select a period in history you would find rape to be looked upon as a barbaric and hateful thing. To say in Western society we coddle rapists is extraordinarily mind-boggling."

whiteknighting,39pzpa,The-Broseph,-7,Sun Jun 14 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"It seems like a small percentage of rapists know they are rapists. There are plenty of people who think it's cool to liquor a woman up till she goes to bed with them, even though legally that would constitute rape. Or boyfriends who think their GF is stingy with sex and maybe they have a right to go through with it when she's reluctant and resisting but not saying ""no"" out loud. There are all kinds of cases that aren't a masked guy in a hood holding a knife to someone's throat where I could see someone believing they were justified in forcing someone to have sex.  EDIT: Just found a statistic to back this up. ""According to the survey, which analyzed responses from 73 men in college, 31.7 percent of participants said they would act on 'intentions to force a woman to sexual intercourse' if they were confident they could get away with it. When asked whether they would act on 'intentions to rape a woman' with the same assurances they wouldn’t face consequences, just 13.6 percent of participants agreed."""

But the biggest crime is that this little temper tantrum basically says ""If some -ism causes even one ounce of good in the world, it is never ever okay to criticise it ever again. It is also never acceptable to stop believing in that -ism, even if our world no longer needs it, keep forcing the issue. To do otherwise is sacrilege and heresy and punishable by (social) execution.""  In other words, Feminism isn't an ideology anymore, it's a religion.

White people stopped being treated like their lives have no value by their rulers about 100 years earlier than everyone else, and then worked pretty hard to extend that benefit to the world. White bashing is so popular these days that people forget that slavery is not something white people came up with, it's the standard of all human history, and western culture is what changed that."
whiteknighting,38nq3m,UrbanZenMonk,6,Fri Jun 5 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Slavery was very common in the middle east before Islam abolished it.   I use this as an example because I'm a muslim. and a lot of Muslims bash white people for their history while our history isn't exactly spotless. Islam improved the middle east greatly, but it also created an opportunity for terrorists to rally misguided armies behind them."
whiteknighting,38nq3m,bbpgrs,2,Fri Jun 5 19:05:17 2015 UTC,It's still very common in the middle east.
whiteknighting,38nq3m,kimchifart,-6,Fri Jun 5 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"I lived in Dubai, UAE for 13 years before moving to canada. It is non-existent. I have friends and relatives living in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iran, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. None of them have ever witnessed slavery.  There are areas where laborers are treated poorly but not outright enslaved. This happens everywhere though. Oh and most big companies are actually Australian/British owned in the gulf area so It's strange that they don't have better regulations like they do in Australia/UK.   As I said, the area's history is not great. But it's improved tremendously and people like to overlook that just to confirm their prejudices."
whiteknighting,38nq3m,bbpgrs,5,Fri Jun 5 20:16:39 2015 UTC,Indentured servitude is virtually the same thing. Cmon man you know how they treat the Pakistani workers there.
whiteknighting,38nq3m,kimchifart,-3,Fri Jun 5 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"As I said, many workers and labourers are treated badly. But they are not enslaved, slavery implies they are owned by someone and have no choice of leaving.  The workers are treated poorly but they are also paid and can quit if they choose to do so.  Im not saying it's okay, it's a terrible thing that still needs to be fixed in that country. But calling it slavery is disrespectful to people who were or are truly enslaved.  On a similar note, some Pakistanis are actually very successful and wealthy business men there. If Pakistanis were enslaved they wouldn't be allowed to run and profit from a business.   Servitude is something I do not believe is right, I believe if someone needs servants they should be hired (like maids or cooks) and not just kept around the house. It is not however slavery since again they have the option to leave (legally), it is illegal for someone to servant working for them forcefully.  Again, servitude is not something I agree with, my family has never had a servant, but I know they exist in dubai since multiple acquaintances I had there had a family servant.  The country made a lot of progress over time, but many of its citizens are simply ignorant to even their own beliefs. The way they treat servants and workers is prohibited by Islam and yet they call themselves muslims and preach how they're better than everyone.  A true Muslim knows we are not better than anyone.  TL;DR: Servitude is not something I agree with, I think it is wrong. But it is not outright slavery which is much worse. And overall, while true slavery was abolished, lots of improvement is still needed."

whiteknighting,38hznj,MercMoose,10,Thu Jun 4 22:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah you did. I copied this from the article:  When the VIDA counts come out and multiple publications are shown to publish far more men than women (with the numbers for POC writers looking even worse), editors make excuses about their submission pools – they get far more submissions and pitches from men than women. Then people inevitably respond by telling women to write more, submit more, and pitch more. I think this is exactly the wrong response: Instead we should tell men to submit less. Pitch less. Especially white men. You are already over-represented. Most literary magazines are drowning in submissions. Instead of making things even harder for overworked, underpaid editors, let’s improve the ratios in the submission pool by reducing the number of inappropriate, firebombed submissions from men. You – white men – have all the advantages here, so you should work to solve the problem of imbalance, instead of putting all the burden on women, POC, and LGBTQ to fix it themselves."

Sociologists Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook define cisgender as a label for ""individuals who have a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity"".  Cisgender may be seen as a complement to transgender.  There are a number of derivatives of the terms in use, including cis male for ""male assigned male at birth"", cis female for ""female assigned female at birth"", analogically cis man and cis woman, as well as cissexism and cissexual assumption. In addition, one study published in the Journal of the International AIDS Society used the term cisnormativity, akin to sexual diversity studies' heteronormativity.   A related adjective is gender-normative; Eli R. Green has written that ""'cisgendered' is used [instead of the more popular 'gender normative'] to refer to people who do not identify with a gender diverse experience, without enforcing existence of a normative gender expression"".

Ok she took it up the ass but only as a joke, you know? Bareback, obv. because the guy was allergic to latex and she just didn't want to be a bitch.

Whether they are getting deployed or transferred in the military, going away to college, moving for a job, etc. Young people do what young people do.  Act all dramatic at first(I love you, wait for me, getting married at 21, etc.) and then get over it quickly and move on.  The problem with the military is it is full of younger people, it's full of men, and they end up being deployed to where they can’t/won’t interact with locals, so they just think about their girlfriend back home.  If they were getting deployed to a base in Brazil, where you safely go off base and drink, do drugs, go to beaches, party, and meet all kinds of hot women, you can bet the girlfriends back home would be getting dumped fast."

And he invents all of these new characters who aren't in the show and even leaves out some important ones. Hell, he even changes who Robb Stark's wife is. What the fuck is up with that?"

whiteknighting,37q43a,leonhardt,2,Fri May 29 22:31:28 2015 UTC,"The streamlining aspect is good in theory for sure because AFFC & ADWD can drag at times especially the Dany in Meereen stuff, but they've definitely butchered some of the plotlines in the show, for example the Sand Snakes/Jaime & Bronn go to Dorne plot  They've made other big mistakes as well imo, like downplaying Dany & Jon's flaws to the point where they're basically perfect mary sues at this point, also making Brienne into a superwoman, ignoring Euron/Victarion, turning the Sparrows into ISIS...etc etc"
whiteknighting,37q43a,TomtheWonderDog,0,Fri May 29 22:47:57 2015 UTC,what? Being sold to a man and forced to marry him when you're 14 definitely qualifies as rape still...

No.    He told her she didn't have to marry him if she didn't want when they arrived near Winterfell (granted, if he really would have allowed her to say no, I'm not sure.  I think he knew she would go along with it though).  By agreeing to marry him, she knew she would have to have sex with him.  That is the way things work in their society.  So by marrying him, she consented.    That doesn't mean what happened to her was right, and it definitely doesn't mean Ramsay isn't one of the biggest pieces of shit in the show.  But it doesn't make it rape."

Yep, that thread is filled with white knights defending women's football. It has really come a long way, but even without the physical aspect, men's football, like any sport, is still very far away. That's how it is.  This is one of these things where it's better to just sit down, accept that women's sports are at a different level than men's sports and try to see it from a different point of view, and instead of compete directly and claim that the skill level is not so big, try to see the positive aspects. In example, female tennis can be fun to watch because it's a lot more unstable due to the serve not being as important as in men's tennis and that carries over in all surfaces. Upsets are therefore more common."

There is a very real issue with the portrayal of women in comics (I think), but this one isn't all that bad. Having a sexy cover can be fine, when every time a guy draws a female character on the cover she's shoving out her breasts and not actually doing anything, I begin to suspect that perhaps the interest of the artist is less in the actually character and more in her tits.

whiteknighting,36j5ad,ducatimechanic,12,Wed May 20 09:07:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's because people don't understand the dynamics of relationships. Someone looking at an ongoing healthy relationship is probably going to misjudge what's actually going on.  For example: I would be very kind and gentle with someone I've known for a long time, and them being vulnerable or displaying low self-worth after we've already established the relationship would be seen as strength, not weakness.  Someone who doesn't understand relationships thinks they can just skip to the ""I'm worthless, please love me"" part, and then gets upset when they don't get unconditional love like their Mom gave them."

Plenty of people in this post have seen the same thing I have, so it makes me wonder how much of an effort you even made.  I'm not going through and posting every white knight comment, but here are five I found that were posted within the past 2 hours.  OP got a hotel room, so that automatically means he treated her like a prostitute.  It's OP's fault because he pressured her into going.  Asking her in public is practically rape.  On a side note, I guess that means that everytime a guy asks a woman to marry him in public, he is raping her as well.  Because OP paid for everything, that makes her an object.  OP is a bad person for making the request publically.  Fuck it, here's another five because why not.  Another ""OP forced her"" accusation.  OP had the crazy idea that if you ask someone out, they don't blow you off.  OP's intention was rape and murder.  OP's cologne smelled bad.  OP is a narcisssist and the prom isn't a date."

whiteknighting,36flsc,PootisHoovykins,11,Tue May 19 01:14:10 2015 UTC,"First one was creepy, but also, it's Japan. There's a reason the other people on the train aren't taking his side and that's because it's not a big deal to them. Sure, it's not GOOD that the guy is doing that, but being sneakily perverted isn't as bad as being publicly abusive. It's way more rude to publicly confront and insult people, ESPECIALLY STRANGERS, than to be a sneaky pervert in Japanese culture. That guy is actually reinforcing negative stereotypes of foreigners in Japan of being quick to make threats of violence. Guys like that are the reason many foreigners find there's an empty seat next to them on an otherwise full train during their daily commutes. People don't want the white foreigner to suddenly start a fight with them.  Point is, morality isn't universal, at least not when it comes to being a pervert in Japan. When in Rome and doing as the Romans do might seem objectionable to a foreign person, but that's because you're foreign and bringing your own cultural values there. I'm sure a visitor from Somalia would think a woman wearing a tank top on a hot day in America is disgusting behavior, doesn't mean they're justified in telling that person off in public because of it."

This guy was being publicly abusive for sure. Does he really think women don't do the same thing?...  It's really no big deal. Maybe if they were like 14 I would take his side, but even in DC area shut the fuck up on the metro and don't cause a riff raff."
whiteknighting,36flsc,Duke_LFG,1 point,Tue May 19 13:51:28 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Japan, and I completely agree. Situations like that are a tricky one since the most you would have to gain would a little bit of self-satisfaction, all while looking like a grand-standing goober creating an incredibly uncomfortable situation for everyone nearby.  My friend witnessed something similar to the video happen and just moved in between the guy and the girl on the train, blocking him from touching or creeping on her."

whiteknighting,369xys,Red_Pilled_Redditor,43,Sun May 17 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"The interesting part is if you look into his writing - and similar idiots - they define ""white"" as some sort of cultural attitude separate from Caucasian, which is why he and others like him don't kill themselves (he ran a magazine called Race Traitor, if that gives you a better idea of his angle.)  They define ""whiteness"" as all the bad things white people have done, and say whiteness is a system.   They try to backpedal when people point out it's racist by saying it's some abstract cultural phenomenon, but then they specifically use words like genocide and say ""white men are useless"" and that white people should kill themselves. ""I'm not against black people, I am against blackness and all black men are violent and should kill themselves."""
