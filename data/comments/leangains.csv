leangains,3e4qmc,iCalorieIQ,2,Tue Jul 21 23:06:55 2015 UTC,So you've basically made a website based on /u/2_Suns tracker. So much for credits.
leangains,3e4qmc,nixx1338,2,Wed Jul 22 05:30:15 2015 UTC,"He definitely deserves credit for creating a cool spreadsheet!  If I saw that, I probably never would have created this app.  I'm not sure when he created the spreadsheet; however, I first started working on this a month ago.  It'd be nice if I could have created this in a week. I'm an active member of leangains and check this reddit every day. The first I heard of his spreadsheet was about a week or so ago when I believe someone made a post asking for his spreadsheet.  There is no doubt they are similar.  However, this was well in the works and 90% done before I ever saw his spreadsheet.  I don't take any credit for coming up with the ""idea"" of how to figure out your TDEE.  I learned how to do so on this subreddit.  The genesis of this was I decided to finally get serious and figure out my TDEE.  If anything credit goes to I believe /u/tonytboy and the other uses who made the comments that you need to figure out your TDEE.  I downloaded the spreadsheet that I think tonytboy created from the sidebar about two months ago.  It was basic and was setup for only tracking two weeks so I created my own spreadsheet.  I saw results and saw other features I wanted to add to my own spreadsheet and decided to make an app instead of making the spreadsheet more advanced.  If I cared to prove it to you I could post screenshots showing the date I first started designing the database and writing the code.  I could post the Excel spreadsheet I created two months or so ago.  It doesn't matter though.  If you prefer to use a spreadsheet and the great spreadsheet he created use it.  I think we both love leangains and decided to get serious and figure out our TDEE and share it with and HELP others.  Don't be a hater bro!  Please don't accuse me of seeing his spreadsheet and creating an app.  That is nuts and laughable!  Of course they are going to be similar.  Your track your weight and calories daily and have an average.  Each week you gain or lose weight.  I'm not sure how else you would show the data besides a calendar view.  It's like e-mail.  Every e-mail program has folders, an inbox, etc."
leangains,3e4qmc,nixx1338,2,Wed Jul 22 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"In that case I apologize for wrongly accusing you. There's just too many douchebags out there who would simply ride the popularity train. And please don't misunderstand, I can most definitely see why anyone would use such an application and appreciate the effort you've put into it. As a fellow dev, take this opportunity to gather all the feedback you can, fine tune the app and consider setting up a donation option to cover the hosting costs in the future. Good luck."
leangains,3e4qmc,AngryJazz,0,Wed Jul 22 06:15:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks man!  As a fellow dev hopefully you can see this wasn't thrown together in 6 days.  I actually have a programmer on staff and he and I both created it.  Programmers are expensive, and I spent thousands of dollars on his salary having him work on this for the past month.  Not really worried about the hosting and more than happy to share it for free.  PS.  Interesting you use the word douche bag.  That is the first word that came to my mind and I was like I can't believe this guy thinks I'm a douche bag and would waste time and money copying someones spreadsheet!  I don't deserve any credit for the idea what so ever.  I took the input on this forum on how to figure out your TDEE and made it into an app."

leangains,3e4qmc,halffast,0,Wed Jul 22 00:18:50 2015 UTC,I will give this a try when it supports metric units! Very interesting project - looks very promising.  It is kinda the same setup as the TDEE spreadsheet by /u/2_Suns but a bit easier to log since i don't have to go through my google account (excel).
leangains,3e4qmc,Swan__Ronson,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:34:57 2015 UTC,What unit types do you need support for?
leangains,3e4qmc,datboyrobd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:06:14 2015 UTC,"Just created a account seems you added a lot of the metric units - thanks !   But during setup my height was in feet / inches.   On the main dashboard it also says X lbs lost instead of kg.  My weekly goal is also set in pound per week.  A minor thing is that i have to use . instead of , for my measurement log :)  Also on a side note - is it possible to just edit / add data by clicking on the date from main dashboard. It takes quite a few clicks to get through menues to first add weight then calories."
leangains,3e4qmc,jwpeddle,-2,Wed Jul 22 06:27:27 2015 UTC,Because converting is hard?
leangains,3e4qmc,jwpeddle,0,Wed Jul 22 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"Just need to program it out.  I want to get some real data in there before doing so.  Been working on this for several weeks and wanted to get it out there before programming the other unit types, which there are several of, and they are used in several different places.  If someone uses the app and uses the other unit types I'll program it out.  Seems easy but there is more to it.  If you register an account you'll see all the different unit types."

leangains,3e3o55,datboyrobd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:14:47 2015 UTC,Read what was written. I do dips and shrugs two days before I do deads and chins.  I disagree with the second part.

leangains,3e3o55,datboyrobd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:27:16 2015 UTC,"I wrote that I posted some of my thoughts lately, as in I addressed this in a previous thread. I lift on an A-off-B-off-C-off repeat schedule. A= squats, OHP, calves. B=dips and shrugs. C=deads and chins.   Regardless if you disagree or not it is true, I'm surprised that anyone with a basic knowledge of training would write that off. Especially considering your that you think your stalled.   When you walk into a gym, who has a basic knowledge of training? Because, after training for a number of years in various gyms and with elite DI collegiate and semi-pro athletes, I haven't met a single person that has a ""basic"" knowledge of training.  The only ""truth"" regarding weight training is that strength is the foundation for just about everything. Among a million variables, it is generally agreed upon that intensity contributes by far the largest to increases in strength. Apart from that, the ""truth"" in lifting weights is largely based on past observations and anecdotal evidence due to the nature of it not being held to the same scientific rigors as physics or chemistry, for example. Some of the strongest individuals in the world have never ""periodized"" their lifts ever. I said I ""stalled"", recognizing that it was a temporary event that I was solving."
leangains,3e3o55,tontyboy,-1,Wed Jul 22 02:56:25 2015 UTC,The basis of your argument is the genetically elite that could get train as haphazardly as possible and still break records as long as they busted their ass?
leangains,3e3o55,nixx1338,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"Whilst I would never argue with someone deciding for themselves, I once ""stalled"" on deads and broke it by swapping shrugs from deads day to chest day.  Shrugs definitely take it out of you.  I still only do them on chest day.  Another reason for stalling is most people have a completely skewed view of grandeur.  They want to look like an Adonis, that is completely achievable yeah?  Just keep counting macros and taking pictures of my food and i'll be there.  But deadlift more than 150 kilos?  Squat 400lbs? NO WAY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE MUST DELOAD!  Get some ambition guys, set your sights a little higher and just fucking try over and over again until you can."
leangains,3e3o55,tontyboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"Funny you should mention 150kg deadlift, since that's where I'm stuck at. I've only been lifting for some one year though, so there's my bitch excuse. The goal rep range was 3-5 but I just can't get the 4th rep off the floor. I've seen your logs and you've basically tapered down rep ranges in order to drive progress. Would you say that doing such a thing at my level would be beneficial, or should I just stick with it until I can actually do it? What I'm basically asking is whether you think there is a correlation between training experience and the way stalling should be handled, keeping the big picture in mind."

leangains,3e2e29,celmo,3,Tue Jul 21 12:50:17 2015 UTC,"I'm on a lean bulk right now doing a 6 day PPL split. Other than macro cycling I am following leangains/RPT to a T and getting great results. As /u/aesthetic-as-fuck said the body really adapts to using body fat as fuel.  I have no experience cutting with more than 3 workouts a week so I can't give an opinion on that. For myself, once I'm around 12% fatigue is high and recovery is slow even with 4 rest days a week."
leangains,3e2e29,8edroomEyes,0,Tue Jul 21 18:56:28 2015 UTC,If on a bulk I would try a high resistant starch diet. This makes you even worse at storing fat. Tons of research on that stuff.
leangains,3e2e29,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip. I'll look into it
leangains,3e2e29,8edroomEyes,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"Try it out and adjust your macros accordingly (e.g. smaller surplus on workout days). If you like being in the gym 5 days a week, you will find a way to make it work.   If you're trying to cut though, I wouldn't personally recommend being in the gym 5 days a week."
leangains,3e2e29,QShin,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:10 2015 UTC,5 days a week isn't doing the program as it has been revealed to us.  It would be like doing Starting Strength 5 days week; that's not the program.
leangains,3e2e29,Broxander,6,Tue Jul 21 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on how far you want to follow Leangains. Beyond the fasting aspect there is a RPT routine that functions optimally on a three day split because of how hard it taxes your CNS and recovery.   But a five day bodybuilding split is fine, it just isn't as efficient as  the RPT 3-day split because the arguement is that there are diminishing returns when you really only need three days.  Read the 31minutes AMA (not the PDF) in the sidebar and you'll gain a greater understanding  Edit: the three day split makes it easier to apply Leangains, mainly the cycling of macronutrients throughout the week in terms of muscle recovery and eating whatever you want to help diet adherence.  I assume you're cutting. The rest days are where you can cut calories freely to maintain your caloric deficit. The training days are where you eat at maintenance.   A five day split means it's more annoying to find where you want to cut calories yet maximize recovery. It can be done, you just have to plan it out"
leangains,3e2e29,Mr_Sasyn,2,Tue Jul 21 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"I recently switched from layne Norton's PHAT after 8 weeks to leangains RPT style program, dropping from 5 to 3 days. I honestly prefer it, the workouts are short and to the point and I can see this working for a long time. Would recommend it personally. More time to do other stuff is great."
leangains,3e2e29,MrMontage,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:12 2015 UTC,I've been doing 6 for 2 weeks and down 4 lbs and feel awesome. Muscles are constantly pumped. Leanest I've ever been. Strength and recovery are fine. You just have manage the volume; there's no reason you have o do 3 workouts. And personally I think there's more metabolic benefit to increase your TDEE every day and make your body adapt to using fat as fuel every day. I found the classic LG approach to be boring and too passive in nature.
leangains,3e2e29,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:50 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate a little more on the bit about increasing your TDEE and body adaptation?  Just curious.  I've been running standard LG for 3+ months (down 20 pounds so no complaints) and could use some tweaks as I finish up this cut.
leangains,3e2e29,LukeatanPeninsula,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"Look at the calculator on rest vs lift.  You will have to eat a little more, which is good, and get the same deficit.  However I think there's more because I mean the goal is to create a body that is really lean and inefficient at storing fat, so what's gonna do that more effectively than pounding that point home every day?  It just seems to be more effective than all that bullshit resting and eating like a waif."
leangains,3e2e29,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"Got it, I'll definitely incorporate this to change things up (and eat some more - thank fuck)."
leangains,3e2e29,LukeatanPeninsula,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"My workouts are like 40-45 minutes and it's kind of whole body every day and really time efficient.    I think it's pretty simple, you're trying to force adaptation and your body is saying hey, this dude is doing some intense shit every day and undereating slightly...I'm just gonna have to call on these thousands upon thousands of calories of stored fat to fuel my shit, and keep the lean tissue because it's clearly needed.  Then you base your diet composition and timing to further enable/enhance that."
leangains,3e2e29,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:47 2015 UTC,How long have you been lifting that you can actually pull off a whole body routine daily while making progress (I hope)? No recovery issues?
leangains,3e2e29,nixx1338,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"Eh, 10 years or so - 7 fuckarounditis, 3 serious.  The main goal is to lose fat.  Strength and muscle retention is goal 2, and strength gains are a bonus.  That said, I have added 10 lbs to sq/dl probably due to motor skill from the high frequency. Through 2 weeks, recovery is fine.  I mean 3x5 squat and 1 set of DL every 48 hours is not gonna kill you with intermediate weight."
leangains,3e2e29,aesthetic-as-fuck,3,Tue Jul 21 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"So when are you having your low cal days? Working out 3 days a week isn't because someone's lazy or because we don't have time, it's a system that works as a whole."

leangains,3e2e29,MrMadeInPortugal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"As long as you distribute your total calories properly you should be fine. It will work out to smaller surpluses on workout days and larger deficits on rest days for the same weight gain/loss but as long as you find it tolerable I don't see why not.  You might want to make extra sure you get your healthy fats though, 5 low-carb days might make it tough to squeeze them in."
leangains,3e2e29,DrDerpberg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:41 2015 UTC,Go to 3 days a week and spend the extra time giving yourself a graduate-level course in nutrition science and cooking. You'll be much better off in terms of both health and results.

Slightly OT, but Kabocha squash, for example, is usually listed as having the same nutritional profile as butternut squash (low cal and low sugar), btu it is SOOO sweet and most Japanese webistes (it's also called Japanese pumpkin) list it close to 3x the calories and sugar.  So, it is a big deal, if you are trying to lose weight.  Here are a few links to studies showing differences in sugar content between varieties:  Low maltose, high sucrose, and maltose increases substantially after baking -  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791245/  Here's the table: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791245/table/Tab2/"

I love to eat the sweeter variety of sweet potatoes, but all that sweetness HAS to come from somewhere! If it tastes like a birthday cake, the nutritional profile can't be too different. Then you have ones that taste like cardboard.  I understand that maltose is created after cooking, but maltose is purely glucose from a carb perspective. Which is a good thing. I'm going to look at your links after work"

The amount of fructose (bad sugar) is minimal, a 215g cooked sweet potato will have ~1g. Yams will have a fraction of that."
leangains,3dxq7i,musclehacking,4,Mon Jul 20 18:56:03 2015 UTC,"Fructose is not ""bad sugar"". I find it funny when people say this, because many years ago they would say the exact opposite (""oh don't worry about the sugar in apples because it's natural sugar"").  Fructose has received a lot of bad publicity since Dr. Robert Lustig's ""Sugar - The Bitter Truth"". If you're interested in the topic, I would highly recommend reading this article by nutritionist Alan Aragon. He breaks down the criticisms with fructose and all the supposed studies that show it to be so ""evil"".   As a TL;DR - Fructose in excess can have negative health implications (much like almost anything).  To quote Alan from the article:   ""Well, that’s just what we need in this day and age – obsessive alarmism over a single macronutrient subtype rather than an aerial view of the bigger picture."""
leangains,3dxq7i,hiroshi-ma2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:25 2015 UTC,"So, what’s the upper safe limit of fructose per day (all sources considered)? Again, this depends on a number of variables, not the least of which are an individual’s physical activity level and lean body mass. Currently in the literature is a liberal camp reporting that fructose intakes up to 90 grams per day have a beneficial effect on HbA(1c), and  no significant effects are seen for fasting triacylglycerol or body weight with intakes up to 100 grams per day in adults [15]. The conservative camp suggests that the safe range is much less than this; roughly 25-40 grams per day [19].  Figuring that both sides are biased, the middle figure between the two camps is roughly 50 grams for adults (I’m talking about the general population, athletes with high energy demands can safely consume more).   Seems like that last line suggests the standard 90-120g hepatic limit. It's very easy to overdo this with junk.  I wonder what effects on Testosterone fructose has in those limits..."
leangains,3dxq7i,musclehacking,3,Tue Jul 21 07:41:52 2015 UTC,"90-120g of pure fructose per day? I personally don't think that's an easy limit to overdo. That's >5 cans of non-diet soft drink per day, everyday. That's not a problem with fructose - that's a problem with the entire diet.   You can't eat a diet of complete crap which ends up being high in fructose, and then blame solely fructose for the negative health implications and label it as poison. Just because something might be bad in excess (>100g per day of pure fructose is excess) doesn't mean it is ""bad"" and should be avoided in moderation.   Unless you're doing some kind of retarded fruit-only diet, you should never have to worry about the fructose in your fruit and veggies."

Remember to only calculate the fructose, not just the high-fructose corn syrup (which can can be as low as 55% fructose). Since we're talking about a higher calorie limit we'd also be looking at the higher end of the 90-120g scale.   If you do this, I think you'll find that either:  a) The amount pure fructose isn't as high as you think.  or   b) The amount of calories to reach that level of fructose would be >50% of your daily calories.   I'm all for the occasional binge, but I don't think I need to argue that consuming >50% of your calories on a daily basis from kiddy cereal, chocolate bars, and ice cream isn't the best for your health."

Obviously strength improvement and increase of LBM is a big part of this.  Currently doing RPT training but I've been doing 3 or very rarely 4 sets, close together to keep heartrate (and thus calorie burn) higher during workouts - goal is always to raise the weight on the first set to keep progressing in strength.  I'm currently eating at or below maintenance on work out days, and -300ish maintenance on rest days.  Haven't stalled in my lifts (yet).  I just read the 31minutes AMA and it blew my mind regarding doing just two sets.  I understand and believe the value of doing just two sets for guys like Martin who are already really strong and lean and trying to cut.  But is this a good idea for a female who is still relatively weak (just got back into lifting, not squatting BW yet)?  Meaning, is this strategy going to be good for beginner strength improvement - or should i stick to my 3 sets, or 4?  It's really hard to get away from the mind set that more sets is better."
leangains,3dxq7i,der_brajmang,0,Mon Jul 20 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"2 sets are great for building with a caloric deficit. I was doing every other day to get more volume in but when I took the smarter folks cues of 3 days a week on a cut I feel better, and I am growing faster and loosing weight quicker due to the extra low cal rest day. My trick to keep beginner volume as high as possible is to stay at a heavy top set weight where you are still doing the high end of your rep intervals. Don't get so heavy that you can only do 3 reps. I move up weight after I crush 2-4 more reps than listed. So If I can get 12 reps on a top set bench I will move up. If I can barely hit 8 I stay because when I move up Maybe I only get 4-5. That's just me and it seems to be helping coax out the newb gains. I started with RPT because I wanted to get into a routine that I can use pretty much forever. As long as your form is good you will progress. Whether or not you progress as fast as a beginner program I do not know as I did not compare nor care. Something like 5x5 on a cut seems like you'd stall right quick."

The 2nd is a back off set that equals the first in relative difficulty after you tire from the top set. The extra rep is more a reminder to the muscle to grow bigger for next time. If you can do more great, but it wont help your goals to do more. And as I shed my newbie gains I plan on lowering the rep range to about 6-8 as specified in the pdf.

According to those very opinions, 31min RPT template is the holy grail of weight lifting. Test run it for a few weeks and see how it works for you. See which movements work for you and adjust if necessary. Track progress. Don't like your progress or the workouts? Trash it altogether and pick a routine you prefer and find sustainable. It really is that simple. The thing with RPT is that it may seem easy on the paper, but it really is as intense as you make it. Intense workouts are sustainable only for so much volume and in turn, you are only able to recover sufficiently from so much volume. When the intensity, volume and recovery are right, you will progress. Welcome to RPT - a training method where you find your own limits."

I'm thinking an even 2 pounds might be okay for the first few weeks at least, just to speed things up a bit.   However, with an estimated TDEE of 2100, trying to lose 2 or even 1.7 pounds per week means going a little low on calories (Training days: 1500 / Rest days: 1200, for the lower number) and with little room for errors, it seems like I'm running out of spaces to cut.

I essentially removed my training day 1,800kcal boost.   After 3 weeks: 1lb/week loss. No different from what I was getting with the boost, and a strength stall. Plus it was harder to maintain. Nuts to that. I'm now back on track with calorie cycling 1,400/1,800. Those extra 400kcal are an extra bowl of Special K and two pieces of fruit.   I've cut harder than that in the past (sub 1,200kcal) and encountered the metabolic adaptation thing that may or may not be real: if your body senses an energy crisis it works around it and you don't lose as much weight.

(5' 0.5"").  I had a couple of children and walked out of the hospital in a size 6 for both.  I would be back to pre pregnancy weight within a couple of months.  I wouldn't even try.  I still have really defined legs and my arms are bulky but not defined.  Once 30 hit my body changed.  Everything is different. I grew breasts,  I got endometriosis,  I gained fat.  I spent my whole life not worrying about it and then poof this happens.  I think my estrogen finally kicked in or something.  Endometriosis is linked to high estrogen. So I decided to go back to the gym.  Now for the questions...    The old saying that 1 lb muscle burns 2 lbs fat how many calories does it take to gain 1 lb of muscle? I know it takes 3500 calories for 1 lb of fat either loss or gain.  Should I be more delicate with lifting weights as my goal is not to look too masculine? I don't like cardio for many reasons but I will leave that alone.  On average how much water weight is there after sore muscles?    Thank you all..."

leangains,3dxq7i,mclassy3,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"I wish I still had pictures..  Lol.  I won state championship on curl ups in 8th grade and I barely worked out.  That was guys and gals included.  I could out pushup any guy,  even the ones who worked out.    I had a gym in one house that was complimentary and I went all the time. I was so big that I couldn't buy a dress to fit my arms. My back is still V shaped and it still has good tone. Thankfully,  with years of not doing too much it is more feminine. My 16 year old son is bulking up pretty fast too.  We both have the same distaste for meat and love carbs.  He recently started football and he is 5'8"" and 145. Probably only 5% or less body fat.    Protein we get from nuts,  cheeses,  eggs,  and beans.  Maybe once a week we have meat.    My daughter thankfully is female.  She is tiny at 13 at 4'7"" and 79 lbs.  Her waist is 21"".  She doesn't have the same affliction.  Though we all have no appetite for a few hours after waking.    Willing to trade easy bulking for almost anything else.  Trust me I would give it over."
leangains,3dxq7i,upham,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"Muscle doesn't have a strict 1:1 relationship with calories.  Your body will put on as much muscle as it is asked to do, up to the limit of what it can do, based on what you give it to work with.  The difficulty is that if you have enough of a calorie surplus to put on that muscle, you have enough of surplus to put on fat at the same time.  The Leangains approach attempts to stress the body in a way that makes it devote extra resources to muscle building rather than fat accumulation.  In practice, you will need to tweak your intake up and down to get the results you want.  Heavy weight lifting is an important part of stressing the body for Leangains.  If you are concerned about too much hypertrophy, then you should focus on more working sets per exercise, with a smaller number of repetitions per set."
leangains,3dxq7i,mclassy3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"This was my attempt when I went to the gym.  I picked up 5 lb weight and did leg workouts.  But then I found the ab machine.  Those didn't exist years ago and I enjoyed it immensely.  I put it on 35 lbs and easily did 50 reps.  Today I have very little stress in my abs.  I then went to the bench press and only benched the bar.  This seemed ridiculous and felt silly doing it.  My arms feel no stress at all.  I tried the treadmill and fast walked for 30 minutes with the automatic variable inclines and this was okay I guess.  I remember in middle school at 4'10"" and 105 lbs I used the leg press and could push around 400 lbs.  I know this sounds ridiculous but my legs are and have always been solid.  The only fat on them is the area on my upper inner thigh which is normal for women.  It is so slight that it is barely noticeable. I feel like with low weights and tons of reps that I  will spend hours in the gym to even feel the strain."
leangains,3dxq7i,yugotprblms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:30 2015 UTC,Then why not do higher weight and lower reps?
leangains,3dxq7i,mclassy3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"I could and I am thinking about that but I am terrified of bulking up.  I hear that as a woman it won't happen.  I understand,  but my hormones are off and I have more testosterone than most women.  Since testosterone is the main hormone for muscle building there is a higher chance of bulking up and I remember as a child (12 - 20) I had more of a male physique. I have always competed with men (push-ups,  basketball, football, paintball)  I have the same disadvantage as any short person but I can definitely hold my own.  Even though I am older I still look incredibly young (early 20s).  I still play with the kids and I was the one teaching my son ""dad""  roles.  I am enjoying getting looks like a female should and I enjoy looking more feminine.  However,  I am not enjoying this belly fat that has appeared. I want my washboard stomach again (not for health but to look good naked).  I just wonder if there is a fine line that I can balance to get the best of both worlds."
leangains,3dxq7i,upham,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"Based on your comments, you no longer have the hormonal profile you did when you were 20.  (My guess is that you had an overactive adrenal system, and your lack of appetite was due to an extremely large cortisol boost each morning.  Your adrenal system has slowed down, which means the testosterone isn't fighting your estrogen any more.)  Weight training falls into three categories:   Strength Hypertrophy (size) Endurance   For strength, you are training your nervous system to perform explosive movements.  You do this with high weights, but only a couple of repetitions at a time.  For hypertrophy, you are causing micro-level damage to your muscles, which prompts them to repair themselves and grow larger.  You do this with lower weights, and more reps at time.  For endurance, you are training your muscles to function continuously with lots of fatigue products.  You do this with even lower weights, and even more reps at a time.  For Leangains, you need either strength training or hypertrophy training, to force your body to keep its muscle around.  Hypertrophy is intended to increase your muscle size, so you should focus on strength training.  I would suggest a StrongLifts-style program of five repetitions per set, increasing or decreasing the number of sets based on how well you recover between workouts."
leangains,3dxq7i,mclassy3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thank you for this.  It is so hard to explain my messed up body to people.  Even the doctors seem to have a hard time keeping up.  I will look into strength training but I am going to go very slow.  I don't want to go back to burly muscular short woman again.  Sadly,  my stomach still doesn't ""wake up"" until around noon.  There is no exceptions.  Big meal the night before or 24 hours since last meal.  After I sleep it takes a few hours to not feel nausated.  Funny thing though,  I never had morning sickness while pregnant.  In fact the only time I was normal was while pregnant.  I only have an eating window from 4-8 and I only start getting really hungry from 2-4. I am losing about 1/2  a pound a week in fat.  I am at 134 right now and would like to lose 20 pounds of fat.  I could continue to lose fat but I would like to have a nice toned feminine physique for once in my life.  I am feminine now but a touch  too flabby for my preference.   Also,  birth control pills never were effective for me.  My doctor keeps putting me on different ones trying to prove me wrong. Thankfully,  I was sterilized in 2002 and so was my husband.   I also have trouble with ache now which was never an issue even throughout adolescence.   But i guess that is a small trade off for breasts.  I never had those until 30.  Thank you for your time!"

leangains,3dxq7i,mclassy3,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:27:18 2015 UTC,I hear this being said many times.  However as a 37 year old woman who hasn't stepped foot in the gym in 20 years I am questionable already masculine looking.  I have an athletic build and good muscles.  I always hear how strong I am when lifting items.  Most men ask me to help them move rather than my male counter parts.  When flexing I  have ample forearms and decent upper arms.  My arms almost look too big for my tiny frame.
leangains,3dxq7i,ehmbie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"If your main goal is lose fat, then you just need to eat less calories than your body is burning. The weight lifting will encourage your body to burn fat stores instead of muscle to make up the energy deficit, thus preserving the muscle you already have, so it's very highly recommended."
leangains,3dxq7i,Shaman6624,0,Mon Jul 20 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"I have a question for people who tried the leangains diet,: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7414437.stm  I read this once and considering I always tend to get to bed later and later and I often have to suddenly get up early for something I tried it out.  So I stopped eating at 4 pm and stood up at 8 a.m. and had breakfast immediatly. It worked great! my sleep/wake rythm was reset instantly. and I got tired in time the next day and woke up fresh and rested.   So. The thing is as you know Martin advises to skip breakfast. Isn't it troublesome for your sleepcycle to do that? I love breakfast, is it important to skip it?"
leangains,3dxq7i,upham,4,Mon Jul 20 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Martin advises people to skip breakfast for a couple of reasons:   People tend to sleep better with a full stomach. Social commitments tend to revolve around lunch and dinner, making it harder to skip those consistently. Your body produces a lot of cortisol in the morning, and by not eating, you're forcing your body to get its energy from liver and fat energy reserves.   Only the last one is relevant for everyone.  If you prefer to start your eating window in the morning, then you will lose the (small) benefits of the cortisol boost.  That's all."

You can get used to pretty much anything, but you have to try it first. Having said that, intermittent fasting is just a means to an end (which happens to come with a few health benefits and the simple fact that you don't have to waste time preparing and eating extra meals). Nutrient timing should be all the way down on the priority list, the main diet factors being calories > macros > misc."
leangains,3dxq7i,Shaman6624,0,Mon Jul 20 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"Ok none taken. to the people who may be biased I have this to say: The article doesn't contradict Martin's work.

leangains,3dxq7i,nixx1338,0,Mon Jul 20 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"You see, the thing is that you assume that LG includes skipping breakfast because Martin made it that way. In reality, we skip breakfast for many personal reasons, be it health benefits or convenience. Many people use the LG approach as a means to lose weight while maintaining/building muscle. Skipping breakfast gives you the option to use your day's calories differently, e.g. 2 proper-sized meals instead of 3 small ones make the cut period much more bearable."
leangains,3dxq7i,Shaman6624,0,Mon Jul 20 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"Well considering it's his diet, I don't assume anything he literally says he recommends skipping breakfast.   I was just asking around what people do around here with their breakfast and what their experience with skipping breakfast is.."
leangains,3dxq7i,slayer49,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:51 2015 UTC,I never skip breakfast.  No one does unless you never eat.  Breakfast literally means breaking your fast.  You can do that any time during the day with whatever timing you choose.  Doesn't have to be in the morning.

leangains,3dxhbm,slayer49,11,Mon Jul 20 13:26:45 2015 UTC,"Just gonna put it out there - use wraps.   Granted, at those weights you shouldn't be having grip problems, so keep working at it. That said, if your grip is holding you back then use wraps. No one wants a strong grip, they just want to be able to train with heavier weights.   Fuck this ""no assistance"" attitude. Do what you need to to progress."
leangains,3dxhbm,tontyboy,3,Mon Jul 20 11:56:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Why hold yourself back from advancing a core lift while a secondary muscle ""catches up""?  Do you first set (if RPT) with the wraps, and try to pull the second set with a standard grip. Get some minimalist wraps - like straight canvas, no padding - and feel them dig into your wrists to up your toughness mentality. Work on grip strength a couple times a week."
leangains,3dxhbm,ZeroTwentyThree,0,Mon Jul 20 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"Imo it is too early to start using wraps, and other things should be used first. Wraps will just hinder grip strength improvements, which is required for other lifts where you can't use wraps (bench, OHP, anything dumbbell).  I use wraps, but only when mixed grip and chalk won't get me through. I made liquid chalk using this guide. It's super simple and cheap."
leangains,3dxhbm,modernbenoni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:06:55 2015 UTC,"Grip for bench? Think gravity sorts that one out.   You're going full circle though, if lack of grip strength hinders a movement then why not use something that allows you to do the movement?   If you are capable of deadlifting 200kg but haven't got the grip strength, why deny yourself those benefits in strength training and progression for the sake of ego?   And again, no girls see boys on the beach and think, whoa - look at his grip."
leangains,3dxhbm,tontyboy,0,Tue Jul 21 10:27:14 2015 UTC,"Lol you definitely need grip for bench unless you want to wreck your wrists. You need to be able to lock out your wrist while holding much weight at a kind of unnatural angle. When I say ""grip strength"" I'm referring to forearm strength as a whole, not just crush strength.  Also I said myself that I use wrist wraps when I cannot get the same results with chalk or mixed grip. This is the exact opposite of what you seem to be suggesting that I said.  If you only lift weights to impress girls on the beach with your looks then why are you even deadlifting?"
leangains,3dxhbm,modernbenoni,3,Tue Jul 21 10:34:18 2015 UTC,"If you really think your grip strength is a problem, devote 2 minutes at the end of each workout to hangs. Find a pullup bar. Take as many breaks as you need to initially until you can consistently hang for 2 minutes. That's it.  If you're still having trouble, progress to 1 arm hangs."
leangains,3dxhbm,slibaz,9,Mon Jul 20 12:27:06 2015 UTC,"Firstly never admit you have used/own gloves never.  Grip strength is something that theoretically should increase proportionally with your other lifts as you use it for every pulling movement.  If you avoid straps you will be building grip strength.  Farmer's walks are often recommended for grip strength, but I have found that rack pulls greatly helped mine.  As far as what could help you immediately, use chalk and a mixed grip when you pull."

Grip strength is an issue whenever I go up in weight by more than 1 pound but usually normalizes with my back strength by the next week when I'm at +1 pound.  I've had grip strength problems ever since I hit ""intermediate"" in the fitness standards chart; I've done nothing to improve my grip but deadlift and now I'm close to achieving ""advanced"" for my weight class; so long as you don't take too big of a jump week to week, the issue will sort itself out."
leangains,3dxhbm,Broxander,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:30 2015 UTC,"The thickness of the bar might have something to do with it as well.  My gym has a bunch of different bars (yes, very stupid).

leangains,3dxhbm,Attainable,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:58 2015 UTC,I use hook on just about everything but the heavy deadlift.  When I use the mixed grip I try to alternate the grip between lifts.    Once you get into the really heavy DL that hook grip absolutely smashes your thumbs.

At first this only went a few sets, but after around 6-8 weeks of keeping this up, I now only use asymmetrical grip for my last and heaviest work set. Reverse curls - medium weight 8 sets @ 8 reps, 30 second rests.  Croc rows   I haven't had any more issues with grip since maintaining the above. Don't bother with gloves. Use wraps if you must, but I would suggest only when you are pushing new personal records or w/e when just pulling the weight matters."
leangains,3dxhbm,poundcake42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:20:13 2015 UTC,Chalk is magic. Also I would learn how to hook grip. Tuck your thumb underneath your index and middle finger while gripping the bar. Mixed grip just feels awkward to me now.

This is a very good article which should address all your questions: http://stronglifts.com/deadlift/grip/ .  For me the switch from gloves and wraps happened easily when I started using the right grip (low hand) and used liquid chalk (which should be acceptable in any gym, as it leaves minimum marks on bars). I only  feel the need for wraps when doing heavy shrugs, which are usually 40-50Kg above deadlift weights. Also, what I always do is I pinch carry my plates whenever I load / unload the bar ... in the long run it builds up grip strength."

The FMD consists of two different components designated as day 1 diet and day 2–4 diet that were fed in this respective order. The day 1 diet consists of a mix of various low-calorie broth powders, a vegetable medley powder, extra virgin olive oil, and essential fatty acids; day 2–4 diet consist of low-calorie broth powders and glycerol. Both formulations were then substituted with hydrogel (Clear H2O) to achieve binding and to allow the supply of the food in the cage feeders. Day 1 diet contains 7.67 kJ/g (provided at 50% of normal daily intake; 0.46 kJ/g protein, 2.2 kJ/g carbohydrate, 5.00 kJ/g fat); the day 2–4 diet is identical on all feeding days and contains 1.48 kJ/g (provided at 10% of normal daily intake; 0.01 kJ/g protein/fat, 1.47 kJ/g carbohydrates). An alternative FMD containing 0.26 kJ/g (0.01 kJ/g protein/fat, 0.25 kJ/g carbohydrates) was supplied for 3 days for the evaluation of adult neurogenesis. Mice consumed all the supplied food on each day of the FMD regimen and showed no signs of food aversion. At the end of either diet, we supplied TD.7912 chow ad libitum for 10 days before starting another FMD cycle. Prior to the FMD, animals were transferred into fresh cages to avoid feeding on residual chow and coprophagy."

I think part of the reason it receives so much good publicity is due to its ingredients being quite readily available (intially at least).

It might be in the short term, but in long term there is a better solution. That solution is hypertrophy. (And of course that hypertrophy must be of the myofibrillar variety needed by most athletes, not the sarcoplasmic hypertrophy preferred by the bodybuilder.)   so: the solution for upping my lifts is training?

leangains,3dphsa,eur0pa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:27:42 2015 UTC,"I got into a discussion with my buddy about why fat people seem to be able to lift more.  After searching the interwebs for an answer, the consensus is that on certain lifts (squat for one), having a belly changes the leverage angle and allows for bigger lifts.  This article seemed interesting, suggesting that instramuscular fat changes the angle of the muscle in relation to the bones they are connected to, which allows for greater leverage and results in bigger lifts.  I thought it was interesting when considered in the opposite case - an extreme weight cut.    Maybe removing the fat ""marbling"" in one's muscles changes the angle of force on the skeletal structure of the body and results in a loss of perceived strength? When you get lower in body fat %, maybe you are making a more acute angle of force, resulting in weaker leverage points on the bones themselves, resulting in poorer performance?  I would be interested to see actual studies about these effects. Overall, it is probably a minor contributing factor of strength loss compared to possible muscular atrophy from a calorie restricted diet. But I thought it was interesting food for thought."

It is sometimes hard to tell if you are experiencing a lack of motivation or if you are just over trained. So far I have had one day where I could not move the bar on a deadlift and I had no problems just walking away from the workout. I have also walked away from accessory lifts as well. That being said I have still been adding weight or reps to the big three with consistency, especially in the last 2 weeks.

After she was born, the sleep deprivation took hold. It was very difficult to get 5 hours of sleep by 6am. Waking up multiple times a night for feedings. It demolished any further progress at the gym.   If you can nap when she does, do so. Itll help with the sleep deprivation. Iy took a while for her to sleep the whole night, but after she did, it became a whole lot easier to hit the gym.  Take naps throughout the day,"

Don't beat yourself up over a few weeks or few months. Do the best you can. Honestly just shoot to maintain and stay sane.

I did that for the same reason you're commenting on, the lack of sleep. I was still able to progress on the big 3 like this, but much more slowly.  After 1 year when the night feedings stopped and my wife and I could sleep through the night, I went back to every other day like normal, but with our second child (now 2mo) I've gone back to 2 days a week until sleeping schedules get more normalized. My son (2mo) seems a bit more chill during the night than my daughter was at his age, so I'm hoping it doesn't take a year to get back to ""normal"".

Seriously tho: speaking from experience (my kids are 5 and 2; I'm just about getting back to ""normal"" sleep amounts now), the #1 thing you have to be careful about with so little sleep is injury risk. Because your recovery is so impaired now, ""good sore"" can turn to ""bad sore"" very quickly.

leangains,3dnhn3,FearTheEngineer,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"One hint which i've found has helped increadibly with my sleep but is a bit extreme is the following. Don't use any artificial lights! This takes a bit getting used too but artificial light will disrupt melatonin production.  This means never turning on lights and turning off all eletronics when it starts getting dark.  I was somone who was well known for permamently having bags under his eyes and feeling tired but i don't anymore.  The reason is the blue light which is produced by artificial light and the sun shuts down melatonin production. Which is the hormone which manages sleep, how tired you are and how deep and refreshing your sleep is. If you feel confident enough you can give it a thirty day test.  I would recommend picking up a torch which doesnt produce blue spectrum light for quickly getting to the babies room."

First night: let him/her cry it out for ten minutes, then go in, briefly comfort reassure, leave, and repeat until sleep. Next night: increase to fifteen minutes. Third night: increase to twenty. That's all it ever took for either of our kids. Hearing them cry can be really difficult, but you're teaching them a lifelong set of skills about getting to sleep, self comforting, and independence. For our first kid, the surprising thing for us was that sleep isn't linear, as in they learn to sleep through the night so you're done. We had to repeat sleep training every several months or so, also after some sort of transition, like a vacation. Hope that helps! And good luck."

leangains,3dm73o,simple_mech,3,Fri Jul 17 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Tom? Is that you?! haha jk   You can continue to cut but I'd recommend going on a lean bulk to build up some muscle. You'll probably look better at when you have more muscle after bulking than you would if you just got leaner. Slowly increase your calories until you reach maintenance and hold that for a week or two, still calorie/carb cycling, but make sure your end of week totals are at maintenance. Then about 300-400 calories to your workout days and ride that out until you can't increase your lifts anymore. This should take a long time. If you see you're gaining fat then cut back the calories a bit. Actual fat, not ""I feel fat"" haha good luck, update us soon."
leangains,3dm73o,AngryJazz,2,Fri Jul 17 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advise, i had the same gut feeling about it but its easy to question yourself sometimes. I will move on to a slow bulk - increasing my calories over the next few weeks."

My experience last time i tried to bulk was the same as you describe. The first few weeks my weight was very stable, but then i got sloppy with my diet and gained weight / fat very fast.

Also has lifts rotated every 8 days instead of 6).  However, I have a funny feeling that my body will adopt after a little rest and I'll continue on the same path. Rpt is such a mind fuck.

My lifting philosophy and experiences closely align with tontyboy and Martin. Extremely heavy, balls to the wall, little volume. This has brought me more success than any periodizing I've run in the past. My personal belief is that, if I wish to remain this lean and/or become leaner, my deads will simply need a bit more rest.   But all this is just speculation. My body tends to do this every few months. Perhaps next week I'll load it up and the weights will fly. We'll see."
leangains,3dm73o,joeeeeee_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"I'm 155    holy fuck man.  and you pull over 4 plates for reps?  thats pretty good shit right there.  i'm not surprised on a cut you are stalling, you're already over 2.5x body weight for reps.    if 420 wont even budge off the ground, and 415 can for reps, its mostly your brain in the way now.  How's your form at 415 out of curiosity?  my 5 rep max is much lower around 370 currently but my form is pretty lousy at the end of top set.  and don't even wanna start on squats.  thats down to parallel?  good god i couldn't even get 365 out of the hole last week trying for a 1rm and you are pushing 9 reps??  incredible stuff man"
leangains,3dm73o,chiralC,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a round back deadlifter (lower back stays neutral though). Focusing on form is useless. In fact, every time I used to try and deadlift with perfect form, I'd come close to hurting myself. One day I got psyched up like crazy and pulled weights at reps I had never pulled before.    People worry way too much about form. On my fifth rep with 415, I got stuck for a solid 5 seconds or so with the bar at my shins. My back didn't snap, my upper back was rounded, and I pulled that shit as hard as I could and almost passed out. Once you begin lifting really heavy relative to body weight, your form will become what it is based on your body structure and leverages.   Just to throw this out there, I deadlift belt-less and squat with a powerlifting belt (elite fts leather belt), nike romaleos (spelling?), and wrist wraps. Over time, you really learn how to engage your whole core with a belt."
leangains,3dm73o,joeeeeee_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah from everything I've seen and how it feels during the pull, my low back stays good its just my upper rounding bad.   I'm still beltless in both, but I may look into it now.  Thanks"
leangains,3dm73o,soci4ldrinkr,2,Sat Jul 18 03:56:19 2015 UTC,"I started using belts for both squat and DL two weeks ago, I can really feel the difference in core engaging."
leangains,3dm73o,chiralC,2,Sat Jul 18 10:57:20 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is that due to my leverages, I tried at one point using a one inch belt for deads (rippletoe has a really good article addressing how most people wear their belts wrong for deads). However, I've found I need to be in a relaxed and loose state upper body wise while still maintaining pressure in my abs. This is in contrast to squats where I brace my entire back and core before each lift with a massive breath and pulling the bar down into my back.  I eventually stopped using the belt for deads cause it wasn't allowing me to round my upper back and I couldn't lift anywhere near as much weight."
leangains,3dm73o,turbozed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:05:20 2015 UTC,"Nice. I'm 155 and last RPT session did 385x6 so pretty close on the DL. But my squat is waaaaaay behind yours. I'm probably at a 315 lbs 1rm on squat.   Do you have any form videos or tips that helped you break through a plateau? I feel like I've been stalled at squats for years now.   Also, what program are you running and how much progress have you seen with it? I just started RPT and leangains so looking for some guidance. Good job representin us smaller dudes bro."
leangains,3dm73o,chiralC,3,Fri Jul 17 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"Good questions. I'll try and answer them based on what I've come to believe over the years.  Stick with RPT. IMO, nothing comes remotely close to allowing you to reach your strength and muscle potential as RPT, and it is incredibly effective in terms of time. I'm 27 now and VERY VERY fortunate that I never fucked around training wise (in the beginning). I started lifting weights my senior year of high school after tearing my ACL. Due to my personality and influences, I lifted with extreme intensity and remember squatting 225 x 30 freshman year in college (I did 20 rep breathing squats once/week). Due to soccer, I only lifted in the off season and have basically adhered to this type of scheme the past few years. I luckily found RPT 1.5-2 years ago after screwing around with bodybuilding routines and wasting my time.  Lots of thoughts regarding my squatting. I played D1 and D2 soccer throughout college, played semi-pro for a season after. I was always very fast and could touch a basketball rim by my senior year in high school at 5 ft 6 (before tearing my ACL- lost a lot of explosiveness in my right leg after that). I'm just pointing this out to illustrate how much of a role genetics has in a persons strength/athletic ability (it must run in my family cause I had my younger cousin deadlifting 405 for 6 reps after 6 months of training).  In terms of form, I squat like Ben Rice. Low bar, thumbless grip, back is very horizontal in the parallel position. That's the key part, the lower you get in the hole, the more horizontal you have to become. My lower back is by far the strongest part of my body, and this is reflected in my squatting and deadlifting styles due to my leverages. Watch Ben Rice squat. It was awkward for me at first but became natural after a few weeks. Now, the bar even slightly rolls down my back probably an inch when I'm in the hole and is directly over my center of gravity. Difficult to explain but Ben Rice does this as well and Mark Rippletoe has some excellent articles regarding squat form.  So, in terms of programming, stick with RPT. It's for the long haul man. I don't believe in periodization and I think it's a waste of time. It doesn't make sense to me to have a preprogrammed periodized rep scheme when you have no idea what your motivation, fatigue, and life will be like tomorrow never mind weeks from today.   Observe my deadlifts, for example. I like to think of it as my body periodizing the lift itself. Doesn't make sense to have lower weight days with more reps when you could crush weights and get stronger. Intensity is infinitely more important than anything else."
leangains,3dm73o,tontyboy,3,Fri Jul 17 21:36:51 2015 UTC,Fucking. Word.
leangains,3dm73o,turbozed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for taking the time to write this all out.  I've been lifting for about 5 years now and it's been frustrating being plateaued for so long, especially since I've been putting a lot of effort in.  I don't believe I've reached my strength maximum just yet so I've been trying to tweak some things. For summer, I've just started RPT and leangains for the past month or so.     I totally hear you on the problems with periodization.  I recently ran a Candito 6 week periodized program and on the 1RM week ended up getting sick.  Was pretty disheartening to see no gains at all after running a full program.  Stick to the set volume outlined in the program was also probably causing me to overreach (there was a noticeable drop in my HRV prior to and during my illness).    I'm digging the RPT for now.  I'm using the 2 set RPT program that was suggested in the 31 minute leangains AMA (here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jlsfx/tldr_guide_of_31minutes_ama_pdf/).  Are you using a 3 set or 2 set program, and what are your specific accessory exercises?  I'll start watching the Ben Rice squats and try to emulate.  I've been trying to do more of a mid-bar olympic style squat just because I dig the explosiveness but maybe my leverages aren't that great for that style.    Thanks again for the help brotha."
leangains,3dm73o,chiralC,2,Fri Jul 17 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh another good point. So in my experience (and if I recall candito or Greg knuckols has a video on this) Olympic style squatting (I'm guessing you're referring to a bounce at the bottom as the explosiveness you were referring to?) can only take you so far strength wise.  I don't have my training logs in front of me but I'm pretty sure I switched to low bar around 350ish lbs the first time I ran rpt. Explosive lifters can't grind a weight out. Despite being a much ""slower"" squatter now, I get a better stretch reflex with a very slight dip into/below parallel and can utilize my back and ass much more in the lift.  Dude, you're nowhere near your potential. You're already limiting yourself with that kind of thinking. Lower the weight, switch to low bar and emulate Ben Rice. With the right intensity the weight will be flying up.  Stick to the 31 min ama exactly as it's written. I did that for around a year and a few weeks ago switched to tontyboy's every other day schedule. I love it. In and out of the gym in 45 min or less every time and I like knowing that my body can perform on any given day.  Feel free to pm me with questions man, I don't mind at all."
leangains,3dm73o,turbozed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:42:22 2015 UTC,Can you link me to the tontyboy routine? I spent a few minutes now looking at his profile to find it but couldn't find it.   Thank you again for all the advice and encouragement.

I have what has been referred to as an addictive/intense personality by friends and family. I love to develop mental toughness and constantly push my boundaries. If it hadn't been for soccer and lifting throughout college, I would have joined the seals.  Also, it helps to have some anger haha.

leangains,3dkxe0,Kitski,4,Fri Jul 17 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what the other guy said.  The fasting period isn't magic.  It does have benefits for sure, but the main one is eating fewer calories in a smaller window and feeling satiated.    As for the milk in your coffee, I wouldn't worry about it.  A splash shouldn't hurt, and the counts will be negligible.  Here's what the all knowing god of leangains said about it:   I often encounter questions that goes a little something like this  ""...can I use milk/cream in my coffee during the fast?""  ""...will I break the fat if I have a 1/2 cucumber during the fast?""  ""...I accidentally drank a mouthful of regular Pepsi during the fast, is this considered a fast breaker?""  A: The fasted state is not an on/off switch that immediately gets turned off once you have a tiny amount of calories, like a lot of people seem to believe. The research is not clear on exactly what it is with fasting that causes the positive effects seen in the clinical trials, but some of the hypotheses revolve around  a) letting insulin levels drop below a certain threshold, rather than a semi-elevated state (which would be the case with a higher meal frequency approach)  b) creating an acute energy deficit (which you enter during the fast)  Note that I'm really dumbing this down to get my point across.  So, it's a question of a dose-response effect. Can you have some milk in your coffee? Sure, I wouldn't worry about it and I have it myself. Life would just be too damn boring with only black coffee, especially if you're used to having some milk with it. How much milk/cream? I would put the limit at 50 kcal total used throughout the fast. That's about 1 deciliter or 1/2 cup 2% milk.  Can you eat half a cucumber during the fast? Sure, I wouldn't worry about it, though I don't see the reason as to why you would do so. A cucumber won't fill you up, and eating something, anything, may actually stimulate hunger during the fast in some people. Not to mention the fairly strong hunger suppressive effects of fasting, which makes the need for eating something quite pointless.  In conclusion, use common sense and understand that the fasted state and the positive effects that may result from it isn't an on/off switch, or an 'all-or-nothing' kind of deal."

leangains,3dkxe0,Broxander,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:17:13 2015 UTC,"I understand; my brother-in-law only gave it up after he injured himself doing crossfit—he still is trying to rehabilitate himself solely so that he can go back to it.   Regarding Leangains, if you want to do just intermittent fasting and caloric deficits by themselves, you'll do fine if losing weight is your goal. In the end, intermittent fasting is all about making weight loss easier. If you do nothing else but follow the meal-plan recommendations in the 31minutes AMA you will have an easy, easy time managing your weight.  To do the program we call Leangains, however, requires more than just diet. It's similar to how the lifting program ""Starting Strength"" requires you to eat around 7,000 calories a day; if you do not do the diet then you are not doing the lifting program."
leangains,3dkxe0,snake_case,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:46:33 2015 UTC,That makes sense- and a good explanation too!  Sounds like IF is the way to go at least for now. I'd def keep leangains in mind down the track if I change my training though away from crossfit.   Thanks for the advice!
leangains,3dkxe0,snake_case,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:50:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.   In the end, it's all about what you want:  If you want to start powerlifting while gaining absurd amounts of strength, you do Starting Strength. If you exhaust the newbie gains from Starting Strength and want to do serious powerlifting, there is stuff like 5/3/1. Similarly, if you want conditioning and community, you do something like Crossfit.   And, finally, if you want an effective way to cut for bodybuilding while maintaining/gaining strength, you do Leangains."

Nothing wrong with breaks here and there"
leangains,3di25o,gnuckols,4,Thu Jul 16 13:44:03 2015 UTC,Sometimes the way these studies are organized baffles me. 3 weeks on/off doesn't sound like ideal way to test this theory. 1 week off every 8-12 weeks sounds more reasonable.

Then Monday off the break I do 3x5 sets at the weight I plan on starting my 5x5 with today, and HO-LEE F**K. What a horror show and I'm still at maybe 80% today leg health wise.  That same 3x5 weight I had done 4x5 with near picture perfect form on all 20 reps 12 days ago or whatever it was. Very little next day soreness.    Absolutely crazy.

Honestly though, if you're getting sick because you're working out on an empty stomach, then don't do that any more. Consider adjusting your fast or workouts so that you can eat before lifting, or just break your fast and eat something on your workout days. It's better to have to break your fast early 3 days a week rather than have a shitty quality workout because you always feel sick."

This is completely possible even if you are eating healthier overall.  You need to first begin by calculating your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) which can be done using some links in the FAQ, and then you need to apply a proper 500 calorie deficit and being tracking your food intake.  For beginners, not tracking what you eat and expecting results in unreasonable."
leangains,3dihf6,Scabbies1,5,Thu Jul 16 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"IF is just a tool, but it won't magically help you lose weight. It still comes down to calories in vs calories out. Even if you fasted 23 hours a day, it's still possible to eat too many calories in that one hour, and you would still gain weight.  If you are serious about losing weight, you need to calculate your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and eat slightly less than that. You NEED to track your calories in order to do this accurately.  As you noted, IF is helpful for curbing cravings and makes it easier to eat less. But IF alone won't make you lose weight if you are still eating too much."
leangains,3dihf6,Peckerdick,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"On top of this, don't believe everything online TDEE calculators may tell you as a fact. When I first started out trying to lose weight a TDEE calculator told me my TDEE was 2700 calories and so I decided to eat 2200 calories a day in hopes of losing weight. I actually ended up still gaining weight despite tracking my macros and calories. I had to do some experimentation with how many calories I ate in a day to see results. So feel free to use a TDEE calculator as a baseline, but just know it may be different for you and you will likely have to find some things out for yourself."
leangains,3dihf6,SnackDrawer,3,Thu Jul 16 16:31:40 2015 UTC,"Very good point, thanks for bringing this up. TDEE calculators are a ballpark guess with a fairly wide margin of error. Finding your true TDEE is a trail-and-error process that can take months. Everybody is very different."

leangains,3dihf6,twomojitosplease,2,Thu Jul 16 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be mean, but I want to help you: your post displays some major ignorance about how weight loss and fitness works:  1.""I want to lose 10 pounds of belly fat""  You cannot choose where fat comes off.  You will lose fat from all over your body when you are at a calorie deficit. Your boobs (assuming you are a girl as you seem to be), butt, legs, arms, face, everything will shrink.  The only way to get a 6-pack is to strip enough fat off your entire body that your abs are revealed.  Doing crunches, etc., won't do anything except build muscles under the fat that you won't be able to see until the fat is gone.   ""I work out every day - either a pilates class, run, elliptical""   Cardio is all well and good, but the best way to get in shape is to lift weights.  Lifting weights will not make you bulky.  The muscle you build will burn fat while you're exercising and all day long.  Your posture will improve and you'll look much better all around.  You probably burn 200 calories doing Pilates - the equivalent of a banana and half a piece of bread.  It may tone you a little but it won't build major muscle.  Get a trainer and learn proper form to start lifting real, heavy weight.   ""The scale is not going down at all.  I work out every day for heaven's sake!""   Weight loss is math.  Anything you hear about slow metabolism, etc is crap.  If you eat less calories than you burn every day, you will lose fat.  There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat.  That means that when you have burned 3500 calories over what you have eaten, you will lose a pound of fat.    Most people strive to eat a 500 calorie deficit every day to lose 1 lb per week.  You need to track every single thing you put in your mouth, because your results have shown that you are grossly underestimating how many calories you are consuming.  Get a free app like My Fitness Pal or Fitocracy Macros and track everything you eat every day.  If you are an average girl, your TDEE may be something like 1800-2000 calories (including exercise), and thus you would need to eat 1300-1500 calories per day to lose 1 lb per week.  Those calories could be anything, you could lose weight eating 1200 calories of twinkies a day, but you will be much healthier, have more energy, build more muscle, and feel fuller if your calorie allotment is made up of a macros of, say, 40% protein, 30% carbs, and 30% fat.  Protein is your best friend.  Simple carbs like sugar will just exacerbate cravings.  If you use intermittent fasting, it will help you to hit that calorie goal without too many hunger pangs.  But there is nothing magic about the eating window - if you eat 3000 calories during your window, you'll just get fatter.  Finally:   ""I'll eat the whole bag if I know I haven't been letting myself eat any chips""   Binging will wipe out any progress you are making.  A bag of chips could have 2200 calories, or practically your entire deficit for the week.  One night of chips and ice cream will undo an entire week of diet and exercise, and you'll gain instead of losing.  No binging.  Take that attitude and flush it down the toilet - you're not rebelling against anyone except yourself and your own goals.  Track your food every day, and your weight, measurements, and body fat percentage every week at minimum.  If you are not monitoring your behavior and your progress, you'll never know what you should be changing.  Good luck!"

I recorded everything I ate for one day just to see what it was.  I went into it trying to prove that I do eat healthy and that there was no way I was eating too many calories each day. My lunch that I had been eating was a wrap made with: whole wheat wrap, 1.5 servings of lox, half an avacado, 2 tbs of home made hummus, 1 serving of feta and some sprouts.  Although this is all really healthy food, it's also food that's caloric.  The wrap was like 700 calories!! So I think my mindset on ""healthy"" was correct, but I still need to be careful and record everything I eat.    So step #1 is to record everything I eat in MFP.  It says for me to eat around 1600 calories a day to lose a lb a week.  That mixed with exercise should do it.  Now I just feel silly that I spent 2 months thinking I was going in the right direction by working out everyday, and have barely anything to show for it.  Hopefully the next month with tracking my food will show more progress.  Thanks for your advice."

You can't make necessary adjustments if you don't know what is going on.  Start off with something like 11 or 12 calories per pound of goal bodyweight. Eat enough protein (between .7 - 1.5g/lb of goal body weight). Track your weight using a 7 day average and reassess after a week or two.

leangains,3ddvao,2_Suns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:54:12 2015 UTC,Quick question. On the 'inputs' tab for 'current weight' is that your initial weight on day one of tracking?  I am trying to back log my data and not sure if I should use what I weighed today or if I should use my weight from my first recorded day. Thank you the sheet is awesome
leangains,3ddvao,BigWaveDave85,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:50 2015 UTC,It is the weight you logged when you first started tracking
leangains,3den85,deckish,2,Wed Jul 15 17:56:23 2015 UTC,Interesting results especially considering the 24 hour fast on rest days and no fast on training days if I am understanding correctly. Regardless your muscles did not fall off...lol. You are killing it though. Keep going. See what your max potential is!
leangains,3den85,NevrEndr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"Also interesting, if anybody noticed--I have a one-year comparison in there (April 2014 to April 2015). My weight is the same despite being 3% lower bodyfat. So that's pretty cool."
leangains,3den85,yugotprblms,2,Wed Jul 15 20:38:32 2015 UTC,"That certainly is interesting.  I think we can probably agree that the ~.2lbs of difference is not statistically significant.  Does make you wonder what it was though, whether muscle or something else.  Edit:  Also, good job.  I've fasted 2 days out of the week before, but 4 is pretty nuts."
leangains,3den85,yugotprblms,4,Wed Jul 15 18:49:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should try it! I find that fasting 3 days in a row is way easier than a 6 hour eating window with only 1200 calories on rest days. And then on work days you get to have basically anything you want and you'll still barely hit the cals you need that day. I cut on ice cream, double portions of coconut curry, and greasy diner omelettes."
leangains,3den85,ichebu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"A full 3 days in a row?  Shit.  I would fast Sunday, eat Monday, then fast Tuesday.    As it is now, my rest days are one large ""meal"" in a two hour window or so.   My training days are kind of like that already though, and I can certainly be dumb about it at times, but I tend to stick to my macros most of the time."
leangains,3den85,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"I can handle 1 full day (~36hrs), but I've tried 60hr+ fasts and it's too much for me. Good on you for being able to handle the mental stress of that."
leangains,3den85,yugotprblms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:37 2015 UTC,It's not significant or even conclusive that it's muscle fiber and not simply water.  There's no way to accurately measure < 1 lb changes in muscle.  But this does certainly indicate that you don't automatically lose muscle on a cut.  I've always thought that to be bullshit.

leangains,3den85,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"I'm saying statistically significant because .2 lbs of change is not necessarily muscle, and can be ascribed to other things.

To be honest, I took a single higher level stats course in college for my degree a few years ago, so I could totally be talking out of my ass here.  Correct me if I am wrong."

Your DL lift makes me really think I'm being a bit too relaxed with mine. I currently do all of the big 3 at 0.8 x 75kg as I'm very new and sorting out form, but while my BP is at the limit, my DL could probably go higher.   I'm also on a cut and building a tonne of new muscle. I really wish I'd had a scan done before I started; there's all these new lumps forming on my arms and chest. It's definitely possible."

leangains,3dehr8,simple_mech,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't think any information was really needed. I have my diet and workouts figured out (I've been doing research for a while), I just wanted to know which workout would be a better baseline to start at.  My main confusion comes from the AMA that Martin's ex-customer did, where he said he wouldn't recommend 5x5 to anyone and RPT was the way to go.  I guess what I'm asking is, regardless of my lift sizes, diet, etc, would there be a significant difference in strength on the lifts/physical appearance depending on whether I did RPT or 5x5?  My current lift sizes are: Squat: 210 Bench: 145 Row: 105 OHP: 100 Deadlift: 205  But I'm planning to deload at around 30-60 pounds depending on the lift (essentially I'm going to start over and work my way back up as if I never lifted before)."

Im 6ft 1 and 185 lbs, (pretty similar to you) and ive done SL 5x5 in the past. If you're only going to be eating 2500 cals on gym days and 1550 on rest days I'm willing to bet you'll start stalling very soon."
leangains,3dehr8,datboyrobd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I completely agree. I was following the macros for cutting under the AMA in the sidebar (with the multiple according to my weight, of course).  My main goal right now is to cut (I put on some weight during the time I wasn't working out) down until a good BF% (I'm in between a 2 and a 4 pac right now, aiming for the full 6), then to bulk. I was then going to aim for 2900 calories on workout days and 2500 on rest days.   EDIT: I attribute the stalling mainly towards me starting out on 5x5 too heavy (my ego played a huge role), because I was hitting around 20 lb more on lifts like the squat, bench, deadlift back when I only weighed 160/165 (around a year ago before my injury) and was a lot skinnier as well. I did a shitty bulk after I stopped StrongLifts and put on a substantial amount of muscle (I have retained maybe half of this since I didn't workout for so long. I also did not change my shitty bulk diet during that time so gained some weight)."
leangains,3dehr8,simple_mech,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:53:49 2015 UTC,2900/2500 is a lot better IMO. What you do for work also plays a large factor. Someone who sits behind a computer is gonna need a lot less calories than someone who does construction for a living.

leangains,3dehr8,datboyrobd,3,Thu Jul 16 19:00:18 2015 UTC,Give this a read - http://www.strengtheory.com/complete-strength-training-guide/#section1  I'd go with 5x5 if I was in your position. You can always move on to RPT later once you've gotten more experience under the bar and sorted out your form.
leangains,3dehr8,der_brajmang,2,Wed Jul 15 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link! I'm reading it right now, I love Greg Nuckols! Edit: Just realized I've actually read that article before, but thanks for linking! It's a really good read regardless).  My only issue is that I wouldn't consider myself a 'beginner' beginner lifter. However, I would by no means consider myself an intermediate lifter either since my lifts aren't high enough.  However, I have always had a large emphasis on knowledge (I would say that I have honestly exhausted most information on lifting online in terms of diet, form, etc over the span of 4 years). I am confident in my form (I videotape myself once every week/two weeks to ensure I have proper form) as well as my diet.  My problem is the consistency of the program that I choose (I had a tendency to switch programs a lot when I was younger). That being said, I am looking to either do RPT or 5x5 for an extended period of time (if I were to do 5x5 I would do the natural 5x5, deload, 3x5, Madcow, etc progression). I just have little experience with RPT and am looking for other opinions."
leangains,3dehr8,NevrEndr,3,Wed Jul 15 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"Your lifts are still weak enough that you would probably benefit from more volume than less at this point. I would start with 5x5 (or some other higher-volume strength routine) and push it as far as you can. Even on a cut, you should be able to get your strength to intermediate levels fairly quick."
leangains,3dehr8,NevrEndr,2,Wed Jul 15 18:46:29 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's what I was thinking as well. I noticed that everyone who has done RPT and reported amazing results has had around intermediate levels of lifts first. Going to go for a substantial deload and do 5x5 until an intermediate level.
leangains,3dehr8,Vhwin,2,Wed Jul 15 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"Your a novice, 5x5 is more appropriate."
leangains,3dehr8,nixx1338,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"I had your same question. I will be keeping with RPT and 2 sets even being new to lifting, late 30's, and skinny. I don't really have time or motivation for 5 sets if 2 can do the job with ample recovery. 6'1"". 174 lbs. As long as intensity is happening and weight is heavy, I should be fine. I'm growing and adding 10-20 lbs. per movement weekly."
leangains,3dehr8,Vhwin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:30 2015 UTC,from my understanding ( i have not done it) 5x5 will stall far sooner than RPT. 5x5 or Starting Strength is useful for people just getting into lifting and will be happy with their newb gains until the inevitable plateau. RPT has far more potential for lifting heavy weight and continuing to progress on a cut. I have nothing to back this up other than anecdotes from fitness professionals and known Youtubers like Alan Thrall.   I have used exclusively RPT since starting LG 2 years ago. I used to do 3x10 as that is what my Dad taught me when i was young. RPT has blown the ceiling off my lifting potential. I never dreamed I would be approaching a 500lb 1RM deadlift at 165lbs. Yet here I am.
leangains,3dehr8,gendarius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for!  On a curious note, what were your major lifts when you started LG 2 years ago? And how long had you've been lifting at that point in time?"

If you can being up your squat you'd be seriously competitive in powerlifting.  It's always surprising what those DEXA scan reveals. Honestly, to most people, you at ~11% bodyfat look much lower into the single digits.   I myself am guilty of overestimating and underestimating bodyfat percentages.  I haven't done a scan but i think I need to.  Considering my current condition, I was of the opinion that I was in the 11-12% range, but I'm considering myself to be around 2% higher now.  Of course, everyone is different, and maybe I hold fat differently, but I'm definitely not at your level of conditioning.  Anyway, thanks for the post!"

leangains,3dbjlx,emailrob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:48:26 2015 UTC,I've always had a work schedule that started around 7am so waking up early has come natural to me.  The first 2 weeks I remember being very tired during the initial waking up and driving to the gym / warming up but after a while I looked at it as getting my hardest part of the day over with before most people get out of bed.  It sets the tone for my productivity for the day.  If Im not lifting that day I will take a short walk to wake up and start the day.  I set my alarm for a time and when it goes off I just get up and start moving.  I will start a podcast and go.  Im a pretty self motivated person.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping up both, as long as you eat enough to recover in time. Half-assing one and focusing on the other will not yield the results you want, though. Priorities: his are cycling > lifting."
leangains,3dcccd,nixx1338,2,Wed Jul 15 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"Cardio isn't the same thing as endurance training.   Maybe it's possible to ride heavy and lift hard. To get ripped doing a ton of cardio. But there's a reason that Martin discouraged HIIT and heavy lifting. Sure, there's guys like Alex Viada who claim to deadlift obscene weight and run a sub five minute mile. But I had this very same question before I started training. Could I progress rapidly on the bike while continuing to lift with high intensity and get stronger? I couldn't. Could I maintain the same strict discipline over caloric intake while craving heavy refuels and going on rides that burned 4000+ calories? No, I couldn't.   That doesn't mean it's not possible. But I wasn't able to do it. And I've completed an Ironman -- I work really hard in this life of mine not to be a bitch...  This isn't a post about walking the dog and doing LG. Or about jogging with your girlfriend. Or playing hoops. It's about endurance training."

leangains,3dcccd,datboyrobd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"Appearance wasn't my priority the past three months. Getting faster on my bike -- and building out the endurance to crush a 200 mile ride was my priority.   But my experience gave credence to the minimalist doctrine: more training isn't necessarily better. That's not intuitive for folks who like to work out. I cut down a LOT on my training when I started on LG, and got much stronger -- looked a lot better naked. When I picked up my training, my aesthetics suffered. That's OK...My priority, again, wasn't aesthetics. It was endurance+speed."

Just drink BCAA's. The belief that you need to eat something (carbs / sugar) immediately before working out to 'fuel' yourself is complete bullshit.

leangains,3d949t,caryc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:31:21 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point where being able to see your abs is the result of consistent caloric deficit, such that your body is forced to pull lipids from storage(adipose) thus shrinking the size of the fat cells.  This, done over a period of time, reduces a body's overall total amount of fat.  Once a certain composition is reached (i.e. a lower body fat percentage) abdominal muscles will be revealed that were once covered in a layer of fat.  So, YES abs do experience hypertrophy just like any other muscle group (as you say ""build abs""). But if your diet did not meet the requirements for forcing your body to use stored energy to reduce your fat levels you would not ""see"" them.  The problem people are having, and why you are bring downvoted, is because you are perpetuating the myth that a person HAS to do abdominal exercises to have abs.  This is simply not true.   What is more likely is your circuit training contributed favorable to lipid oxidation which is exactly what you need in order to see abs.  However, as my previous point explained, without a calorie deficit YOU WILL NOT LOSE FAT regardless of how many circuits you do per week."

I cycle calories/carbs between gym/rest days at 2500/1500 respectively. I work out every other day. The below is what I recently readjusted the macros to, after not losing much of anything the last 3 weeks.  Gym Day Macros: 190g Protein, 45-60g Fat, remaining carbs  Rest Day Macros: 190g Protein, 60-80g (up to 120 on loose days) Fat, remaining carbs which is usually 45g or less  I keep my meals to mostly oven baked chicken with the occasional homemade burger patty or pulled pork. Carbs are mostly brown rice/whole wheat pasta or sweet potatoes with occasional bread for sandwiches/burgers. Other than that I supplement my diet with protein shakes, peanut butter (super chunky ftw), avocados and other fruit, oatmeal, greek yogurt and protein/clif bars. I'm lucky I can get a lot of the supplemental stuff for free at work.  Nothing is set in stone, but I don't get tired of the food so the above is usually what my day consists of. I still go out to eat occasionally and do my best to stay within the outline for that day, and I do still go out on weekends and drink with friends, although I try to keep beer to a minimum."

leangains,3d7qp9,AngryJazz,2,Tue Jul 14 06:19:12 2015 UTC,"It's a little more nuanced than that. In his article, further down under ""fine tuning the formula"", he writes that under ""normal circumstances"" (i.e. not water cutting):   (Height in cm) - 96-100 = kg body weight. Ripped and under normal circumstances.   So let's call it 98, we have for now:  (height in cm) - 98 = (weight in kg)  Lower in the article though, he writes:   The formula is not perfectly linear and is most accurate for men in the 170-190 cm height range. Very accurate for guys smack dab in the middle of that range (180 cm). Shorter guys (below 170 cm) seem to skew the formula towards being heavier. Vice versa for taller guys. In reality, the standard height - 100 formula might look a little something like this depending on height.  190 cm: height - 101  180 cm: height - 100  170 cm: height - 99  160 cm: height - 98   If we use his numbers from higher in the article for ""walking weight"" and not water-cutting weight, we have:   190 cm: height - 99  180 cm: height - 98  170 cm: height - 97  160 cm: height - 96   Let's call the number we are subtracting (99, 98, 97, etc) ""c"". Then we have:  c = 0.1 * (height in cm) + 80  and   (height in cm) - c = (weight in kg)  Combining them we get 0.9 * (height in cm) - 80 = (weight in kg)  That gets us the ""shredded"" (5-6% BF) weight, call it h. To get the lean mass we do m = h - h * 0.055 (for 5.5% BF). Then to get the weight at any bodyfat level b, we do (weight in kilos) = m / (1 - b). That's the formula I used, of course converting to/from Imperial if necessary."

The common advice to dieters of eating 3-5 smaller meals a day never worked for me, I just felt hungry all the time, eating little ~400 calorie meals that never satisfied. I would end up overeating and not make any progress.  With IF you condense those calories into 1 or 2 meals (I eat one on rest days, 2 on workout days.) I find that when I wake up and my body is in a fasted state, I don't find it hard to skip breakfast at all. I stay busy all day, food barely crosses my mind, then I lift and feast.

It was crazy how fast the weight fell off.  But I plateaued and was only able to lose another 15 pounds over the next 5 years or so.  Then I gained the 30 back and decided to try LG.   Been doing LG since February and have lost 20 pounds,  while making excellent progress on my lifts.   But the progress is slower than my previous diet efforts. If you are very fat,  I recommend the slow carb diet to take care of the first 80% of your body transformation quickly and easily. Once you stall on that,  I think LG is a great protocol for the final 20% of going from ""good""  to ""great."""

Before that i started my weight loss from 265 doing a high cardio low carb diet. It wasn't until about 230 when I started lifting weights intensely, not knowing wth I was doing. I was a previous experienced lifter however I was clueless about nutrition and body composition. I did tons and tons of reading on my own and figured out tdee. So when I started leangains I was so relieved to finally lift weights and sustain muscle and not depend on cardio for weight loss.  Right now I would say I am about 10% bf weighing 175. I decided to start my bulk since I have a little bit of abdominal loose skin Which I hope to feel in with increased muscle mass.   Anyways, honestly I think anyone can do leangains regardless of bf , it really does all come down to nutrition and dedication. If you're far away, a little cardio, lifting and eating right will work in the beginning but when you hit that plateau, go strictly leangains."

leangains,3d93kq,Bpnzk74,4,Tue Jul 14 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"How long have you been lifting? If you're already squatting near PR levels (no matter how heavy that is), you could probably get away with a split routine. Something along the lines of:  Wed: Pull (Deadlift)  Thu: Push (Bench)  Sat: Legs (Squat)  This doesn't necessarily have to be RPT. You can still stick to the progressive overload principles of SL5x5 while keeping the 5x5 setup. Alternatively, Madcow will let you use the SL5x5 template but alternates the squat intensity."

leangains,3dahwa,FidgetyWidget,3,Tue Jul 14 19:38:44 2015 UTC,Dumbbell rows give you a better range of movement imo. Kroc rows worked wonders for my back and shoulders
leangains,3dahwa,tontyboy,2,Tue Jul 14 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"Whichever you don't flat out hate and can perform with proper form. For most benefits probably Pendlay rows, regular barbell rows or t-bar rows."
leangains,3dahwa,nixx1338,2,Tue Jul 14 19:48:11 2015 UTC,bent over barbell rows are my preference - help to strengthen the upper back which translates well for deadlifting.

leangains,3d8boi,reacon84,5,Tue Jul 14 08:10:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the cut is starting to get to you.    Should I consider more volume?   The last thing you need when stalling on a cut is to add more volume.   Now assuming you have been stalling for at least a couple weeks, you could try either:  a) Consistently taking 2 days rest between gym sessions as opposed to 1  b) Eating at maintenance for a week    or  c) Microloading with smaller plates  Start with whichever you feel will be the least intrusive."
leangains,3d8boi,musclehacking,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:15:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I'm going to try eating at maintenance and see how I get on. Hopefully that will push through the plateau.
leangains,3d8boi,Ibakebread,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"I like option C.  Just keep going man! Get lean. Lift with intensity and micro load the bar. Once you are lean enough,  slow bulk and add weight to the bar. In my opinion that will present a more aesthetic body.   I think it is easy to judge progress by how much weight you are lifting week to week,  but on a cut you will experience diminishing returns. Instead,  measure progress on a cut according to intensity and effort in the gym. Less quantifiable, but we all know when we pussied out on the last rep.   3 weeks of stalled lifts on a cut with all the effort you have is more impressive than adding 5 pounds on a slow bulk imo."
leangains,3d8boi,T_muld,3,Tue Jul 14 19:11:37 2015 UTC,You  could always use a pl training program
leangains,3d8boi,T_muld,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:17:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the noob question, what is a PL training programme?"
leangains,3d8boi,NevrEndr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:45 2015 UTC,Powerlifting. It will be periodized as opposed to the RPT style where you just add weight when you can.
leangains,3d8boi,gendarius,2,Tue Jul 14 15:09:21 2015 UTC,Noob gains are over now the hard part starts!   This is difficult on a cut because there is a point where your body will stop progressing because it doesn't have the calories it needs to grow more muscle tissue.   How much do you sleep every night? Do you drink? Do you have stress outside of the gym such as demanding family life or work? All of these are factors that bleed through into the weight room. I know you said your goal was 65 kg and you are currently 73 and so you need to make a decision. You can have stalled lifts and finish your cut then bulk. Or you could start a slow bulk which works wonders coming off of a cut on a lean individual. I recommend the slow bulk - if you do it correctly you will remain lean and aesthetically pleasing AN you will start making progress again in your gains.   if you continue cutting do not increase volume. Do not deload. just keep going with your diet and routine because isn't the goal of cutting aesthetic instead of strength based? The goal of a bulk is to get bigger and stronger. The goal of a cut is to get shredded while maintaining strength. You can't shred fat and gain strength forever without anabolic steroids.   Hope this helped! Good luck!

leangains,3d8boi,mamoru,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"You need to eat more, and take walks on rest days.   Experiment by increasing calories until lifts start to move up, if they s again then increase calories, don't focus on being super lean until you're Bane in the gym, then you have my permission to cut."
leangains,3d8boi,Top5ive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:31:07 2015 UTC,"Your numbers are very novice. At your level a less drastic cut, but something like a recomp, combined with a higher volume routine (Starting Strength 3x5/Strong Lifts 5x5 [start light]), will garner better results than what you are currently doing.  Once you can squat ~110kg, switch to Texas Method/531/Candito etc. while still recomping (+20%/-20%). You will become much stronger and you will look and feel a lot better.  Research has shown that moderate cuts are much more muscle sparing than drastic ones (here and here). The psychological effect of being able to eat more food while still losing fat will have a greater effect on your training performance (more volume = higher TDEE). And above all, more frequency to practice lifts and more volume to drive strength and hypertrophy, you will break your plateaus within the first 3 weeks of training.  edit - here's a brilliant site that has a calculator for several of the most popular intermediate programs."
leangains,3d8boi,Mickyhcorbett75,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:15:52 2015 UTC,You can run a novice program and eat more.
leangains,3d5l86,mrvinceho,15,Mon Jul 13 18:27:31 2015 UTC,"1) Doesn't matter. You're overweight. Keep cutting, boy. You probably have some muscle under there somewhere. If I had to guess 25%+?  2) Calories are what is important. Macros second. Just make sure you get enough protein so you aren't wasting your muscle, and keep yourself on a steady deficit until you get down to ~10% BF.  3) Cardio isn't necessary, but it can accelerate the process. But it will counter act your gains in the gym without the proper nutrition so ultimately it's almost futile. Your best bet is to cut whilst trying to increase your lifts.  4) That's silly. Squats ought to be enough, but ab training can be done virtually every work out if you work out 3 days a week. I'd do them last of course because you need your abs for the squat/deadlift. The adage just means you'll never make abs in the gym--you just need to eat properly (not eating a surplus)."
leangains,3d5l86,yallrcunts,8,Mon Jul 13 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"To add, you should do brisk walks for as long as you can on workout and rest days. It'll help burn extra fat.   The saying should really be ""abs are made in the gym and revealed in the kitchen"". It just means no matter what you have, you're not going to be able to see them if you have fat on top."

Abs are built in the gym, revealed in the kitchen. No harm in doing ab-work, the quote is just to make people realize that no matter how ripped your abs are, you'll have to get down to a certain bodyfat% to see them. Do your ab work at the end of your workout and you'll be fine :)"

leangains,3d5l86,Typhoidnick,5,Mon Jul 13 21:48:45 2015 UTC,Thank you so much!! I definitely feel a lot better
leangains,3d5l86,caryc,3,Mon Jul 13 22:40:57 2015 UTC,"1) Actual percentage doesn't matter at where you are. You need to keep cutting, consistently and slowly, for a long time. You've made nice progress, but you're nowhere near where you'll want to be eventually. At a guess, 30% in the second picture.  2) Focus on eating a balanced diet. It actually won't make that much difference for your primary goal, but it will make you feel MUCH better, make you MUCH healthier, and the psychology of it is better, IMO.  3) I recommend that anyone do cardio, not because it helps lose weight (it doesn't, because it makes you hungrier), but because it's just a great thing to do for yourself, and it makes you FEEL great to have more cardio endurance. However, I would recommend against doing Insanity/P90X type, super-high-intensity workouts at this stage. You'll only hamper your recovery from lifting, which is the crucial thing now. I'd say just walk. Start with what you can easily handle, and work your way up to 3-4 miles a day. Don't add any calories for it, just get out and do it. Your body, your heart, your organs, and your waistline will all thank you. Once you get lean, if you want to do lots of HIIT, do it. I do, now. But while you're in a significant cut, which you will be for a while, you're not doing yourself any favors.  4) You don't need to do ANY ab-specific exercises. Get your deadlifts and squats up to a good weight, with good form, and you'll have all the abs you need for a six-pack. Focus your lifting time and energy on doing those Stronglifts workouts perfectly and consistently. If you're progressing those steadily, that's all you need. Anything else is a waste of energy.  ADDITIONALLY: Your protein intake actually seems a bit high, as a percentage of your diet and in absolute terms. 288 on workout days, 238 on rest days? What's your weight? You need AT MOST 1g/lb/day, and according to the studies I've read, really .75g/lb/day is plenty to retain muscle. If you can make your diet easier to adhere to by lowering protein intake, you should do it. This is about sustainability."
leangains,3d5l86,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the informative response! For my protein intake, I multiplied 31Minutes' macros by .92 since I weigh ~185, so that gave me those numbers.  From the PDF:  ""These are the ones I started with and essentially the same as what Martin recommends to his clients: Workout Day: 2756 Calories (Maintenance). 313g Protein. 274g Carb. 45g Fat. Rest Day: 1768 Calories. 259g Protein. 88g Carb. 74g Fat. That is for somebody at 200lbs. To figure out your macros, adjust based on your weight. For example, you weigh 180lbs and want to cut? Multiply my macros by 0.9 to fit your weight.""  I'm just following his guidelines since he seems to know what he's talking about and he's been a past client of Martin's, but I'm open to alternatives"
leangains,3d5l86,cmoneyt8ker,3,Tue Jul 14 02:40:19 2015 UTC,"If you weigh 185, you don't need more than 185g for sure. 150 would be just fine, according to the most believable, most scientific studies I've read. Sorry I can't link them here, don't have them to hand.  I know people worship 31Minutes around here, but that protein intake is going to make for a really tough daily grind in terms of diet. You're going to need to cut for long enough that you don't want it to be a grind. Make it easy on yourself. If you get down to 12%BF and feel you need to try something more extreme, fine, but the idea that you're gonna average 250g of protein a day for a year or more is just not that realistic, especially considering the sort of diet you're coming from.  The most important thing you can focus on now is sustainablity, not optimization. Pick something that's not a struggle and do it for a long time. You didn't get that heavy in 6 months, and you're not gonna get lean in 6 months either."

No calorie cycling, no mention of macro cycling, no mention of IF, no mention of lifts, and doing cardio on workout days.   /r/fitness may be more help to you at this point, but while you're here I'll ask the pertinent questions: what are you doing to track calories (food scales + MFP?), and how far below your estimated TDEE is 1700? What sort of protein level are you getting? Is the 1700 just from food or are you taking the balance after cardio? Do you trust your weight measurements?  All that aside, depending on your carb/salt/water intake, water weight can stick around for a bit, but you might have expected some drop after 3 weeks all going to plan.

If they're between 20 and 30, I don't know how these people have friends or maintain relationships. Everyone's gonna out drinking and partying, do they just sit at home and watch netflix? Bars are complete shit sober, and being drunk is fun anyway. Not to mention that most guys who go to bars sober and prey on girls are really creepy.  What you have to understand is that you're never going to achieve a really low bodyfat % if you're drinking more than once a week, but you can definitely get it lower while actually living a life. My strategy is to try to stick to either vodka sodas or jack and diet coke, so all the calories come from the alcohol. I usually consume around 12 oz of alcohol in a night, although it varies wildly, which adds up to like 750 calories or so. Not awful, basically equal to a meal, but you're probably not losing weight from that day. Make up for it the other days of the week, and by sticking to lean proteins and leafy vegetables on the days you do drink. As far as binging goes, I don't do it much but it does happen occasionally.  To prepare for it, I make sure to have pure-protein snacks set up for consumption, like tuna cans, cooked chicken, and beef jerky (a kind without a lot of sugar) that won't be stored as fat. Or you can put in some work and bring back a girl, not gonna be binging those nights. If you're not losing weight, but still want to drink, you're gonna have to lower the calories elsewhere in your week."

If I want alcohol but I'm firm on the top two goals, then one or both of my fat or carb goals won't be reached for that day. I tend to try to keep any weekday beer to a workout day where I can sacrifice carb goal much easier. Lower alcohol beers (0.5-3.5% ABV) make this much easier, and beers themselves do have carbs.   Of course, the other way of thinking has penetrated MFP and there are beers in the database with 30g of fat.

leangains,3d49d6,yugotprblms,3,Mon Jul 13 14:48:51 2015 UTC,I just ask my her what we're having for dinner and plan accordingly. If it's my turn to pick or cook I pick something to fit my macros. Luckily she is understanding of the difference between rest and lifting says. She has seen the progress I've made and likes the abs so it's a win win. Haha
leangains,3d49d6,qqqyqnz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Well, stick to it 90% of the time.  If you have a spontaneous ice cream trip, make up for it elsewhere, or don't.  10% of not so strict adherence won't hurt you in the long run, but abstaining from having fun with your SO certainly will."

I stick to my diet most of the time, and other times I just work it in.  Some ice cream on a training day?  Easy.  Smoothie or something on a rest day?  Adjust dinner accordingly, or don't.  No big deal."
leangains,3d49d6,simple_mech,0,Mon Jul 13 15:00:57 2015 UTC,Just discovered this sub reddit recently and wanted to give this a try as I've been on a cut recently and want to change things up after I just did a refeed. Couple quick questions:   I typically do fasted cardio in the morning at about 7am followed by some ab or plyometrics and then do lift after work at about 530 pm followed by a light amount of cardio. Should I delay my vegegreens and protein shake till noon if I make my feed window 12-8?  Should my macro counts change at all for this transition or is 1-1.25g protein per pound and a 50/50 fat carb split still okay?  Do you guys load your calories at the start of the fasting window or does timing in the window matter at all?    Thanks for any feedback in advance.
leangains,3d49d6,Rasser58,2,Mon Jul 13 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"1) Yes, delay your shake   2) Protein is the same. You should be cycling carbs and fats. Shoot for 75C/25F on workout days and vice versa on rest days.   3) Timing does not matter although it is recommended you eat most of your calories post workout. For rest days just do what works for you, some days I want a really large meal (75% of my calories) in my first meal and save the rest for a snack later and some days I eat a small amount and get full so I save the rest to play around with later."
leangains,3d49d6,simple_mech,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, follow up for question number two, the 75F and 25C on rest days, how important is that? Usually my rest days are Saturday/Sunday and for Saturday, a lot of my calories come from alcohol so would be primarily carbs and that 75f25c is unlikely."

leangains,3d1z31,boner-zone,4,Mon Jul 13 06:33:58 2015 UTC,"I am not diagnosing him with that or anything, but ""form"" issues like his are not always form issues. Peoples anatomy is different, not everyone looks or functions the same way. I'm pretty sure MB spent considerable time and effort into researching his deadlift form and it's unlike to be ""wrong"" for him (could be wrong for you though).  For example, there is a congenital spine deformity called schauermanns spine characterised by an immobile segmental hyperkyphosis. This usually results in a compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis and an extension compensation in the upper thoracic spine.  (For those interested, take a look at his extended (top) position in the mirror in the first video. Note the extreme lumbar extension with relative lack of thoracic extension. In the bottom position (set-up) note the extended upper thoracic spine and neck as well as the relatively extended lumbar spine, even in the relaxed state before he starts pulling)  Now, the second link, the RZdb channel I haven't seen before. Did some digging around for the rest of my comment and found that he actually links to one of the videos on leangains.com so it's definitely him.  It's interesting to note that it appears it took almost 5 years for him to get from 270x3 to 272,5x4. Talk about patience and the law of diminishing returns!"

It sucks something fierce and I know everyone judges the fuck out of my upper back when I DL, little do they know though, eh?   Martins doesn't have any kind of Kyphosis that's visible. I've seen his back pics.   A postural kyphosis issue wouldn't be a problem in a guy who lifts often, or it would be really rare.   Also the degree his upper back is bending would lead to him looking like a fucking ape when he stands up if that is as straight as he can get."

I'm not diagnosing him, or suggesting he has schauermanns specifically. But I am pointing out that it's possible, his back pics don't exclude it. You are likely aware, since you have it, the schauermanns presents in degrees of severity of ""hardly noticeable"" to ""quasimodo"".   Also the degree his upper back is bending would lead to him looking like a fucking ape when he stands up if that is as straight as he can get.    He's not going to deadlifting as straight as he can get now is he? A kyphosis deformity is more pronounced when a person bends over, in a way that is pretty damn close to what he looks like. Not saying he has it, but I AM saying that his deadlift form is unlikely to be sloppy like he just walked in the gym one day and deadlifted, and never worked on his form until he hit 600lbs.   My comment was in response to all the people going off on how ""poor form"" he's showing."

leangains,3d1z31,datboyrobd,4,Mon Jul 13 15:06:29 2015 UTC,Personally the rounded back doesn't bother me as much as the ridiculous lockout.
leangains,3d1z31,RealNotFake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:45:57 2015 UTC,"If i pull like that i can lift 10-20kg more. Keeping the upper back straight it's hard for me because i'm tall (Same as him) and if you do RPT you don't want to stall, so you might start breaking your form a little bit in order to lift that weight, he might did that a lot of times lol."
leangains,3d1z31,aesthetic-as-fuck,3,Sun Jul 12 22:38:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like WHEN you pull more, your back naturally does that.  I would guess it's because unlike the lower back, where you have a slab of ab muscle countering the contraction in the lower back, you don't have that so much with the pecs countering the upper back.  I'm 6'4"" and I currently DL 3x/week 1x5 with 3 sets of rack pulls at like +10% of my DL.  So I feel this enables me to stay really on point with the movement pattern and I'm not maxing out and not wearing out my lower back muscles or getting that lumbar tenderness I get if I'm pulling upper-back-rounding weight.  For me, when I round the upper, the lower loses a little bit of neutrality as well.  I just like high frequency more than RPT, just preference"

Weight is coming off and I will post my excel sheet when I have a month of data.  I alternate DL (1x5)/bi/rear delt with squat (3x5)/tris/side delts.  Not benching now because I really am not that interested in it and have always used DB's.  I strained something near my left scapula during a bench and it's been bothering me so I'm taking a few months off.  My chest has always been way ahead of my arms anyway.

When my form starts breaking down on deadlift or I notice my upper back starts rounds on the last few reps I usually just stop as I don't want to snap anything.    Is it recommended to just continue doing reps even though form is breaking down?

leangains,3cxmq9,Freddy_Mac,4,Sat Jul 11 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"So lately I've been finding recipes that can be adjusted to either workout or rest days, that way you find something you like and either eat the same thing or tweak it slightly to fit workout or rest day macros. Only downside is about an hour of cooking time but it's worth the wait.   The recipe I found is a zucchini lasagna and it's pretty simple and awesome. Here's the jist of it. We're not making baked goods here change it up to fit your macros, meaning the measurements don't have to be exact.   So here's what you need:    2-3 zucchini's 1lb lean ground turkey or chicken (shoot for 99% lean ground turkey) Jar of tomato sauce (try to find one with less sugar but naturally it'll have some because tomatoes naturally have sugar) A lot of spinach, 12-16oz or whatever you want Small tub of cottage cheese, fat free or 2% (~16oz)  Mozzarella cheese, nonfat, shredded, for topping  On workout days I'll add quiona between the layers. You add it in uncooked and it cooks in the sauce while the lasagna bakes.    So here's what you do:   Add protein to the pan and brown while breaking apart (doesn't necessarily have to be well done since it'll cook more in the oven but I like to cook it almost all the way since it'll get that weird turkey flavor out) You can also saute onions with it here or add some minced garlic about 2 minutes before the next step.   Add tomato sauce and heat. You don't really want to cook it because all you'd be doing is reducing it (evaporating the water) which will give you less sauce to work with but getting rid of some of it isn't bad.   Remove and set aside, you can wipe the pan or not but add the spinach and wilt. It helps if you cover the pan. Drain spinach of liquid and set aside.   While the turkey cooks, slice zucchini into somewhat thin slices. The first time I made it I sliced by hand. Second time I used a mandolin, they both worked well but I recommend using hand sliced pieces for the top layer or else your they will be too thin and will burn.   So you have meat/sauce, cooked spinach, and sliced zucchini. Time to assemble. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.   Start with a small amount of sauce/meat mixture. Now layer zucchini to create a.... umm, layer? Now spread about 1/3 of the sauce/meat mixture, half the spinach, and half the cottage cheese. Now another layer of zucchini, then 1/3 sauce/meat mixture, the rest of the spinach and the rest of the cottage cheese. Then another layer of zucchini and top with some of the sauce/meat mixture. The last 1/3 of the meat/sauce mixture should be divided between that bottom layer and the top of the lasagna, I'd say like 1/3 of the 1/3 on the bottom layer and the other 2/3 of the 1/3 on the top of the last layer of zucchini (head spinning yet?).   Now top with however much cheese you like, cover tightly, and toss it in the oven for 45 minutes, then 20 minutes uncovered, then broil for 5 minutes or until the cheese browns. Then destroy the entire fucking thing.   I'd normally add the macros up but it really depends on how you customize it. The macros for the basics are:   zucchini (65 calories, 5P/1F/12C/4fiber)  spinach (72 calories 12P/0F/12C/10fiber)   turkey (480 calories 112P/4F/0C)  cottage cheese (2% is 320 calories 52P/8F/12C)   cheese (depends how much you use but 4 oz is 316 calories, 36P/0F/8C/4fiber)   and the jar of tomato sauce varies greatly so you can add those yourself but so far we're at:   1,253 calories 217P/13F/44C/18 of which are fiber  Note: You can add whatever you want between these layers. On rest days you can add more cheese between each layer, making it ooey gooey goodness. Don't cheap out on the cheese on top, it's what makes it. I'd even do full fat cheese. On workout days you can add quinoa in the layers which gives it a nice texture. Either way, go nuts! Enjoy!!   Edit: Damn that was longer than I expected. It's honestly simple but I went into detail. Basically just brown turkey (with seasonings or aromatics if you'd like) while you slice zucchini, add in sauce and heat a bit then set aside, wilt spinach, drain and set aside. Assemble and bake. Takes less than 20 minutes of prep total.   Edit2: Here's some pics!! Couldn't wait and ate half before I remembered to take a pic: http://imgur.com/a/bEs2G  Edit3: You may want to let this rest for 10 minutes before cutting."

Whole pizzas, trays of food, cartons of cereal or milk, tubs of cottage cheese, etc. The feeling is just so gratifying.   What's nice about this recipe is you can drink your BCAA's and assemble, cover and set it in the oven. Ideally you can ""delay cook"" 20 minutes then have it start up for 40 minutes, go to the gym and get back just in time to uncover, cook another 20 while you shower, set to broil while you dry off and get dressed, take it out the oven and destroy.   Or have your roommate or housemate or whoever uncover it for you if you don't have delay cooking.   Or get it ready before, lift, then preheat oven when you come back from the gym while you strip naked, pop it in the oven while you shower and get dressed, should be like 40 minutes, uncover and in 20-25 minutes your food will be ready!

leangains,3cxmq9,AutoFrost,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:27:25 2015 UTC,I just looked up the nutrition facts online and used the one most people can eat but I just buy it from Mariano's because they have an organic one. Although it's not 99% lean I'm willing to make the sacrifice.   If you buy the store ground and packaged then it won't have nutritional labels. Best bet is to find out how lean and either look online or look at the package of the non-store packaged ones and use that info.

leangains,3cxmq9,jiggsmatee,2,Sun Jul 12 02:33:15 2015 UTC,"cost co rotisserie chickens ($6 for the whole bird and it's all cooked for you). individually frozen tilapia from walmart cheap fatty tubes of ground beef/cost co beef patties   i poach the tilapia, cook the burgers hot and fast on the grill, come out rare.  roast chicken (if i get raw) in the oven.  then divide it all up into 8oz portions, and spoon in 200g of mixed veges.  chill in the fridge, then set them in the freezer for long term storage.  if i need more flavor on the veges i'll toss in a few strips of bacon while they cook in the pot.  or else cheesy popcorn flavoring.  i'll take out 3-5 of them during the day, heat up and eat.  i now more see them as, ""if you hungry, fucking eat one"".  god knows it'll be less fucked up than all the other free shit at work or in the pantry.  really love doing this now.  so easy to just grab another one from the freezer and heat it up.  going to have to try the togo plastic boxes from amazon people recomended in /r/bodybuilding.  edit: it might not be sexy eating, but it's really great utility.  also, if i make 3 bags of mixed veges, i'll toss in a bag of chopped spinach.  spinach flavor hidden by the mixed veges."
leangains,3cxmq9,jim002,3,Sat Jul 11 23:19:30 2015 UTC,So here's the big question that has stumped bodybuilding.com for years: how do you count a rotisserie chicken in your macros?
leangains,3cxmq9,jiggsmatee,2,Sun Jul 12 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"chicken with skin on.  maybe count a few carbs in there in case they brined it in sugar too.  i'd just look it up as baked chicken.  then again, my goal is 12% bf at best, and a long time out.    i just aim for 3lbs of meat a day.  skinless chicken thighs, 80/20 ground beef or roast chicken is the most fatty meat i go for."

leangains,3cxmq9,JayHerman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:01:49 2015 UTC,So you prefer to kind of guesstimate your macros? I only ask because there are so many different results for the macros of a rotisserie chicken.
leangains,3cxmq9,ZeroTwentyThree,2,Sun Jul 12 03:41:44 2015 UTC,yes.  the most salt and sugar ive ever added to chicken breasts was 4g of each per pound.  the chicken ended up tasting too salty and sweet.  so i have to imagine there's less than 4g of sugar per pound of this thing.  then you have white meat and dark meat.  so at worst i'm getting 12g of sugar if i ate 3 pounds of this meat in one day.
leangains,3cxmq9,ZeroTwentyThree,2,Sun Jul 12 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"Rest day is keto day for me! 8oz sirloin with a 3 egg omelette, 60g of cheddar, handful of spinach and some broccoli thrown in.

leangains,3cx1i8,gogo_fsho,3,Sat Jul 11 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"Just track your weight and adjust as you go. What bf% are we talking here? I'm guessing low because you're naturally an active person. Try to find calorie counts for the activities and eat back half.   You see, all that activity is probably just putting you at ""lift 3x/week on the calculators"". If you're averaging 2500 per day then eat ~1600-1700 on rest days and 2500 on workout days. That's -800/day which puts you at 3400/week, assuming 4 rest days. You really should be lifting 3x/week, it should take priority over climbing."
leangains,3cx1i8,simple_mech,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Great, I think that is good advice to eat back half for certain activities - particularly the ultimate frisbee because it is cardio that I wasn't sure how to account for. I'm not sure my BF%, I'm wherever flexed six-pack and emerging-but-not-very-vascular falls. When I look at those comparison picture charts there are areas where I think I have both better and worse definition than the examples which I think comes from my longer experience climbing than lifting.   I think you make a really good point about deciding a priority. I understand that within the LG program, weight lifting is means by which the traditional gains are gained, but what if climbing ""gains"" are my long term goal? I usually end up lifting 3x a week anyway because the gym is close to work and it's easier to fit into my schedule but that is not necessarily my preference. That being said, from what I've gathered the purpose of a cut is to cut and maintain as much strength as possible so maybe I am just spreading myself too thin by expecting performance in lifting and climbing. Perhaps you are right and I should prioritize lifting over climbing during my cut to maintain strength and then re-evaluate my goals in 3 weeks. I chose a 6 week cut for more of a proof-of-concept to myself and to get good baseline data for further goal-setting.  Thanks for your insights and opinions - you've given me lots of good info to think about."
leangains,3cx1i8,simple_mech,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about exact bf%, I just meant are you 25% or 15% lol   Yes you are right in saying you are spreading yourself too thin, you need to prioritize your goals and really cut out things that are adversely affecting you achieving those. The way I see it, if you continue to climb you can maintain strength but it will be very or or impossible to increase it while if you cut it out you can increase strength while cutting.   It's only a month out of your entire life, won't make much of a difference if you cut down the climbing a bit. It's a great way to increase TDEE so you can eat more but I wouldn't go too hard at climbing, to the point where it hinders recovery. But it doesn't hurt to burn more calories. The issue is if you get on the wall and can't help but to go as hard as possible then you might be better off just cutting it down to no climbing or maybe once a week. Best of luck!"
leangains,3cx1i8,qqqyqnz,2,Sat Jul 11 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"Are you losing weight at a rate that will reach your goal? Of so, your calorie intake should stay the same. Otherwise, raise or lower it. That formula doesn't change based on physical activity.  For the health issues I suggest: checking that you didn't accidentally introduce a deficiency in your diet, you're getting enough carbs, and your first meal after a fast doesn't have a lot of simple sugars (will cause your blood sugar to go wack and you'll feel super tired right after that first meal until your body gets used to fasting.)"
leangains,3cx1i8,qqqyqnz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice, I'll take a deeper look into my diet to check for deficiencies. Are there any deficiency besides dehydration that could cause drymouth that you know of? I usually break my fast with some kind of protein and vegetable meal but I didn't know about the post-fast sugar thing so I'll try to be more cognizant."
leangains,3cx1i8,IronandCoffee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"It's easier to look for where your diet deviates from the norm - e.g. less dairy -> calcium, and so forth. The most common deficiency is vitamin D - something like 70% of people have a vitamin D deficiency."
leangains,3cx1i8,schmolch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:36:53 2015 UTC,"I found that two bouldering sessions a week and lifting twice a week is a good balance. Count climbing days as lifting days (unless your climbing sessions are more of a social event and less like training) and eat around maintenance, then just go low enough on your rest days to maintain a significant weekly deficit. That's what worked very well for me during my last cut at least."
leangains,3cw4mo,Sepean,15,Sat Jul 11 07:16:29 2015 UTC,You have to give it more time.   Weight loss is generally linear over the big picture but not so day to day or even week to week. You keep changing it around and your body needs time to adjust.
leangains,3cw4mo,simple_mech,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:21:09 2015 UTC,"I adjust every 2 weeks, right?  But still, I should be in a major deficit. The calories have to come from somewhere. The options seem to be   I somehow became really bad at counting calories I'm in recomp and burning energy dense fat and building muscle, so weight stays the same (I'm an advanced lifter so I doubt that) I'm burning fat but retaining water or gut content or something."

Otherwise, I think the best source on refeeds is lyle mcdonal: link. I know that at a bodyfat of 14% and higher you should do 3 day refeeds every 14 days, and that under that bf% you should do refeeds as frequent as your percentage (if you have a 13 bf% you should do refeeds every 13 days, at 7% it should be every 7 days and so on), but I don't know if the refeeds should be the same length as when you have 14% or more.  That being said, you should still be able to lose weight and preserve muscle without refeeds. They are beneficial, specially <10% bf, but not a need."

leangains,3ct7zo,Deanb1307,13,Fri Jul 10 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"Your body needs a certain amount of training to grow/increase strength. This gives it that amount. Everything else is just extra and you're getting less bang for your buck the more you do.   There's 2 variables to the equation, intensity and volume. If you are hitting one real hard then the other suffers. I know you think getting in there and doing 15 sets of shit for your shoulders will make them grow but doing 2-3 sets of high intensity will make them grow just as big. You can't do high volume and high intensity. It might feel like it's tough as hell but that's only because you're uselessly exhausting yourself.   For example, you can get in there and bench 200 for 3x10 then hit incline 185 for 3x10 then hit decline with 80lb dumbbells for 3x10, it will be hard and you will be exhausted but you have to realize that you could've just benched 250 for 8 then 225 for 8 and then hit dips with 115lbs for 6 and 100lbs for 7 and gotten the same results, or better, with the added benefit of higher strength gains.   There's a saying, I don't remember what it is, but it's along the lines of ""any idiot can make another idiot tired"". It's not just about being tired, it's about getting results.   Edit: also look at your reasoning. Even if me and you got the same results, I was in the gym for 3x/week for 45 minute sessions while you spent 90 minutes 5x/week. Who spent their time more usefully?"

He gets burnt, skin peels etc. He has to wait for a week and a bit to recover so he can sit in the sun safely again.   Whilst person B, takes in the sun for 15minutes only. He does just enough to stimulate/trigger the cells/enzymes etc of the skin. Then the next day he does it again and again.   In 2 weeks times, person B has achieved much more tan then person A."

leangains,3ct7zo,qqqyqnz,4,Fri Jul 10 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it doesn't work and I'm giving it a try I just want to know the science or an explanation of how this is better? anybody help me out here?   The science behind it is that Martin's RPT protocol is inferior to a program with more frequency and more volume. Scientifically, weekly volume is what drives progress.  Increase volume (& frequency of lifts) slowly over time and your progress will skyrocket.  If you plan on doing a higher frequency RPT routine, you will not recover for the next session. Your second day for a given lift will suffer. Increased frequency with lighter loads has been known to speed up recovery time (Texas Method’s active recovery day).   Increased frequency will also allow you to practice the movement more, and since strength is a skill…you’ll get more practice at getting better at that skill.  Organize your training so you can get the most volume throughout the week, for instance:     Monday: 2-set RPT or RPT + back off sets or Heavy triples (5x3)   Wednesday: Hypertrophy (sets of 8-10)   Friday: Medium (5x5)   Play around with it and see what your body CAN do for that specific day. Recent studies have shown that hypertrophy, followed by a lighter technical day (singles or doubles with your 5RM), followed by a strength day (5x5, 5x3 even RPT) allows for optimum recovery.  RPT works and it’s very time-efficient, however, the above principal will take you to your goal much faster than a low frequency 2 set-RPT routine."
leangains,3ct7zo,AbstractThinker,2,Sun Jul 12 00:37:34 2015 UTC,A less technical answer: time or intensity doesn't equate to efficiency. A three hour long movie isn't automatically better than a two hour movie because it has a bunch of extra scenes.
leangains,3ct7zo,AbstractThinker,2,Fri Jul 10 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"I did that generic thing for 5 years, and for the past 2 months I've been doing 31AMA's 3 day split, 2 set workouts. I guess I could chime in. My muscles are not as bulky with the swollen look as they were on a generic workout. However, on the lg method, I'm pushing more weight, while losing body weight. This equates to a more aesthetically pleasing body.   Also, eating at a deficit is hard enough as it is. Imagine doing 4-5 workouts a week. This is killer, and will result in over training.  Just my personal opinion of it after 2 months."

leangains,3csfvj,litprof75,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"I'm already stronger than I was when I stopped lifting several years ago, but that's 'cause fuckarounditis and no intense focus on the big lifts (e.g. I never even did deadlifts).  Following 31min's RPT program, except for bench, which I do same weight 3x5. I do that because I don't usually have a spotter, and 3x5 allows me to work almost to exhaustion without doing a single set to failure."

OHP was no better. my goal for today was 140x4 and I did two...TWO reps after 3 last week.   Oh well it was an off day. Havent had one in a while. Maybe 6 hours of sleep isn't enough.

I've moved to a 1 on, 2 off workout frequency to allow more recovery time which, along with eating at maintenance is really helping with all of the minor injuries I've racked up.  This week I'll be deloading on the deadlift to work on some deficiencies that are popping up in my form, going for 220 on the bench, and hopefully going up to 135 on my OHP, +65 for my chinups and +80 for my dips."

Those small muscles heal quickly and there's nothing wrong with adding work to your routine.  You do gain muscle in a deficit but it's tremendously slow.

Leg press, machine BP, and lighter deads (if ground movements are rare enough that you can just drop it if things go wrong), chin ups will all suit you well"

I'm in my 40s.  My ""secret"" to summer abs has always been:   Strict caloric monitoring.  Sous vide my meat + veggies and weigh out pretty exact meals into glass storage.  This is also VERY cheap to make and monitor. Scale monitoring to adjust macros. 18/6 IF schedule to help with hunger control. SL5x5 focused on the Big Three for muscle retention.  I don't do any accessories but if I am traveling I'll focus on BWF instead of free weights. On non-workout days I'll do sprints to exhaustion for fun.  I love throwing a Frisbee disc and trying to catch it myself.  Sprinting fasted, of course. Yohimbine appears to work on my body, but it may be placebo.   2-4 weeks I can shed the 8-10 pounds I need to shed to get down to 8%.  It doesn't even feel like work.

leangains,3codsp,Tall_LA_Bull,6,Fri Jul 10 11:30:10 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to comment that, if your goal is pure aesthetics, that cardio is actually going to make things harder at this stage. I'm in the same range, and I do tons of cardio because I love doing it and love feeling like a beast, but I find that doing lots makes my body much less willing to accept a caloric deficit, and makes it much harder to track exact calories by number.  I'm not saying don't do cardio. Everyone should do cardio, because it's great for you and feels great. I'd just say that it's going to be a slight hindrance in going from lean to shredded. No fat reserves + tons of cardio = stress on the body = body requests more calories. Just my experience."
leangains,3codsp,Tall_LA_Bull,6,Thu Jul 9 19:59:05 2015 UTC,My main sport is jiujitsu which is very cardio intensive. The point of losing fat for me is for aesthetics and performance.  Although I'm not sure of your reasoning for cardio being a hindrance. If my diet doesn't meet energy needs those calories have to come from somewhere. Ideally fat stores.
leangains,3codsp,GothicToast,0,Thu Jul 9 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"Did you read what I posted? I said that, for me, heavy cardio makes it harder to run a deficit. Not that cardio won't help you create deficits. Just that it forces me to eat more, and eat closer to my daily expenditure, in order to feel good. Not sure why that's confusing."
leangains,3codsp,_nephilim_,2,Thu Jul 9 21:45:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for clarifying. I did read it and when you said  > it's going to be a slight hindrance   Is what confused me. But I see now you were referring to you.
leangains,3codsp,Tall_LA_Bull,3,Thu Jul 9 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"I think its absolutely possible to overdo cardio on a cut - and you see female competitors do it all the time. They can never reach that ultimate conditioning because they're spending 2 hours a day on the elliptical machine. Their bodies won't get rid of that last bit of fat because their metabolism is holding onto as much energy as possible. However, if you are progressively cutting calories from a solid foundation of 3000+, 30min of cardio a day toward the end can really benefit you shedding those last few pounds."
leangains,3codsp,_nephilim_,2,Fri Jul 10 07:11:51 2015 UTC,I find that jogs and long walks suppresses my hunger pretty well in the morning or evening. But that's fairly low intensity. I could see high intensity or HIIT being quite different for hunger levels.
leangains,3codsp,Tall_LA_Bull,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, cardio of any intensity suppresses appetite for me in the short term, but if I'm doing lots of cardio and fall into too much of a deficit, I get shaky and crabby.  Also, are you doing this while already lean and headed to shredded? Because I had no trouble at all doing this at higher bodyfat. As I've gotten down to 10% trying to go lower, though, it's become an issue."
leangains,3codsp,simple_mech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"I've never been below 10-12%, so that might be why I had an easier time. I'd also get shaky but I don't think it was necessarily the cardio."
leangains,3codsp,ehmbie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with more fat reserves, it wasn't an issue for me. This whole thing gets trickier the leaner I get."
leangains,3codsp,simple_mech,3,Thu Jul 9 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it seemed like forever. The reason is because I stopped focusing on fat loss and geared more toward strength gains. When someone asks ""what's the fastest you can lose fat"" my response is usually ""as fast as your lifts will let you"". Once you shift your thinking then it's a lot easier because you're not staring at the scale and the mirror, the idea of ""can't wait for this cut to end"" is gone, you just keep increasing strength as if you're on a bulk but with the added addition of losing fat."
leangains,3codsp,sfvalet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:04:41 2015 UTC,You're saying it takes forever but don't worry about it? Just focus on getting stronger and keep eating a deficit?
leangains,3codsp,litprof75,3,Thu Jul 9 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. As long as you're gaining strength that is. Not literally forever but I prefer steady strength gains and fat loss over a 12 week period than sudden fat loss and loss or stagnating strength over an 8-9 week period.   My primary goal is to be the strongest version of me possible and being really shredded is goal number 2. To get shredded and lose strength and work again to gain it back, being demotivated in the gym and feeling like your just stuck in a loop were not worth the small amount of extra time needed to continue."
leangains,3codsp,sfvalet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"I seem to be at that stage right now. I'm lean, but not where I want to be. The scale tells me my weight is going down week to week, but it's so slow at this point it feels like progress is stalled despite the numbers on the scale.  I am measuring the week to week difference based on an average of all the days per week. So i know that difference can't be totally due to water/undigested food as those factors will be accounted for in an average across 7 data points.  This is the point that requires continued persistence I suppose.  Fortunately, I am still making progress 8 weeks in which is the benefit of a slow cut."

I've never deliberately cut below 12% or so (though as a swimmer in high school and college, I was down in the single digits frequently). Started Leangains protocols at the beginning of the summer, and I've been dropping about 1.5 lbs per week to go from ~19% to ~12%. I'll reassess TDEE this weekend and then probably ease up on that rate just a bit as I get closer to 10%. At the same time, I'm following the tips in the ""stubborn fat"" link you provided --- fasted LIIT for 30 minutes after lifting; fasted LIIT for 30 to 60 minutes on rest days. My lifts are still going up, but that's maybe in part due to newb benefits. (I took a couple years off of lifting after my daughter was born.) So far, I haven't tried Yohimbine, but I'm wondering about others' experience with it."

If it has zero calories and you want to continue your fast then you can consume it. If you are tracking your intake calories (I presume you are not capable of eyeballing your calories yet) then so long as you are doing that correctly then that is what is important.

leangains,3cjr80,Top5ive,3,Wed Jul 8 13:27:08 2015 UTC,"Your metabolism isn't fucked, you're eating too much. TDEE calculators are ballpark best estimates for the average person. You could fall anywhere outside of that window. That's why you start at that number, track your progress (weight, body fat % if you have an analyzer) then re-assess on a weekly basis. If you're moving away from your goal, you adjust your intake, rinse and repeat until you know your actual TDEE."
leangains,3cjr80,Peckerdick,2,Wed Jul 8 17:16:53 2015 UTC,Man this comment helped me a lot. Thanks.
leangains,3cjr80,yugotprblms,2,Wed Jul 8 17:18:48 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, you say the calculator gave you 3200 cals to maintain weight, then you ate 1900-2100 a day.  Why would you do that?    Have you tracked weight daily?    If someone asked you if you thought they were eating too much when they gained weight, what would you say?  But in the end, you say you want to build muscles.  Why is gaining weight an issue?"
leangains,3cjr80,tcoop2232,2,Wed Jul 8 13:39:37 2015 UTC,"I think he meant that he was consuming 1900-2100 kcal/day and then changed to his ""maintenance"" value of 3195 kcal/day.   OP - you are quite clearly over-estimating your activity level in whatever TDEE calculator you are using. 3195 kcal/day is more than maintenance if you're seeing a consistent weight gain."

leangains,3chijg,LiftLaughGrow,9,Tue Jul 7 23:17:29 2015 UTC,"OHP 225 for a million lol   I think the biggest take away from this is    ...that's going to come down to how far you can push yourself in your head. You'll reach limits, and you have to learn how to push past those limits   A lot of people reach their ""limit"" and call it a day. They try to hit a pre prescribed rep range even though they have more in the tank. You think your body works off a certain rep range? If you hit 8 reps and had more in the tank you should grind those out and take note of that. I left a comment a day or two again about this exact thing. The user commented saying ""only do 1 more rep on your second set, don't go beyond that or you won't recover properly"". Wait what? So you're telling me you were able to do more and just stopped?   This applies to anything in life. You need to get out of your comfort zone and go a tiny bit beyond to improve. You'll never improve if you keep doing what you're comfortable doing. How do you expect to learn to solve new problems if you keep solving the same ones over and over? It's not just about reaching a new weight, it's about teaching your brain that ""you said I couldn't do this two weeks ago and I did, you said the same thing last week too yet I did, and here I to prove you wrong again""."
leangains,3chijg,simple_mech,3,Wed Jul 8 00:41:28 2015 UTC,if you're following RPT you lift so much on your top set that you can only get +1 rep on your back set. If you can do more always do more. Isn't RPT and Leangains about pushing yourself to failure (or just a tad below it)
leangains,3chijg,teketso,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:08:33 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly but you get to a point where your back off set isn't heavy enough. That's when I started progressing individually between the two sets because the second set just wasn't heavy enough. Or let's say you stalk your top set, would you keep doing the same back off set? That wouldn't really make sense. If you can progress on the back off set, why wouldn't you?"
leangains,3chijg,simple_mech,2,Wed Jul 8 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"but you get to a point where your back off set isn't heavy enough   i think that's what is missed by a lot of people, because they are still lower in strength.  when you are pulling only 225 for the top set, the backoff is only 22.5lbs lighter.  so it would be more difficult to pull that for usuaully more than +1 or so reps.  but when you're pulling north of 430, that backoff set is less than your last warm-up most likely and can definitely move more than +1."

leangains,3chijg,mozerfoquer,3,Wed Jul 8 09:21:25 2015 UTC,"Arnold has a bunch of good quotes, and of course it's relative to your goals, and applicable to any area of life.  Doesn't matter if you want to compete as a bodybuilder or not, it's all still the same shit.   ""A beginner does eight repetitions of a certain exercise with his maximum weight on the barbell. As soon as it hurts, he thinks about stopping. I work beyond this point, which means I tell my mind that as soon as it starts aching it is growing. Growing is something unusual for the body when you are over eighteen. The body isn’t used to ten, eleven, or twelve reps with a maximum weight. Then I do ten or fifteen sets of this in a row. No human body was ever prepared for this and suddenly it is making itself grow to handle this new challenge, growing through this pain area. Experiencing this pain in my muscles and aching and going on is my challenge. The last three or four reps is what makes the muscles grow. This area of pain divides a champion from someone who is not a champion. That’s what most people lack, having the guts to go on and just say they’ll go through the pain no matter what happens. I have no fear of fainting. I do squats until I fall over and pass out. So what? It’s not going to kill me. I wake up five minutes later and I’m OK. A lot of other athletes are afraid of this. So they don’t pass out. They don’t go on."""
leangains,3chijg,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"But you did get the takeaway right? This should resonate with everyone at any level to push past limits if they are stuck and need a kick into gear. Strength is a tool for bodybuilding when non enhanced, and even other wise it still sounds true for any one no matter their goal or routine/program when it comes to weight lifting. I'd like to be strong, yes, but I'm a bodybuilder as well. If I'm stuck benching 185lbs for reps and I'm trying to get my chest and tris bigger, and I haven't pushed past that, ill never bench 225, 275 or 315. And if I'm benching 315 for reps and got there with consistency you best believe my chest, tris and front delts will look a hell of a lot better. Same can be said for something like lateral raises or even bicep curls."

leangains,3ch3x3,Zedekul,5,Tue Jul 7 21:29:11 2015 UTC,My advice would be to resist creating a correlation between a specific workout and day of the week.  Sometimes workouts need to get moved around and this really messes with people who suffer from paralysis by analysis.

leangains,3cgk08,Auralito,2,Tue Jul 7 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"Doubting yourself is the worst feeling, i've been there. I get it, your unsure what to do, i've had my moment like that about a month ago. My opinion would be to keep cutting, martin has said and its been on the front page of leangains recently that he would cut clients to low bf% then bulk up, so maybe its best to keep cutting, and then from your lowish bf% go on a long slow bulk and be ready for summer 16. but i myself am fairly new to leangains, so read others comments and see what they say.  I dont train RPT style so i won't comment on question 2 since i have no idea and i'm not going to waste your time and pretend like i do, so again wait for some other comments.  As for 3, I'm from the uk also, Fage 0% greek yog get that from Asda or Tesco. I'm currently going to Iceland for chicken £10 for 2kg defrosted, its not cooked, but they do cooked bags of frozen chicken cut up for £5 a bag, i've ate that loads i'm sick of the tase now but its simply put it in the microwave and eat. Iceland for eggs also, 20 eggs for £1.60, just try only use the whites from the eggs as they are high in fats (16g for 3 eggs) when watching your fat intakes. Veg and carbs i get from Aldi. Aldi are always doing deals on Veg so you walk in and see what the deal is, this week it was 220g green beans for 59p i think. 2x Avacados for £1.20 also for when your low carbing and need fats. Low fat cheese your best bet is Tesco or Asda, aldi low fat cheese is rubbish, simply. Bags of couscous are 39p in Aldi also coming in at 33g of carb a bag, i love them, low cal and decent carbs for when your carb cycling at around medium carbs."
leangains,3cgk08,milkmeh,2,Tue Jul 7 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"bulk I personally like keeping BP in the 3-5 reps range like deads and squats.  but obviously a set of 3 needs to be very heavy or you are just wasting your time. I'm US, so i can't give you a specific brand... but these have been my go-to's for filling in the macros:    high carb / low everything - marshmallows, apple chips (dehydrated apple slices), bananas, straight up table sugar (throw down a teaspoon or 2, because why not lol) high fat / low everything - bacon, pork grinds, mayo, dark chocolate (higher on carbs, but a lot of those are fiber so it still works well) high protein / low everything - turkey jerky, quest bars (probably have something similar in the UK or they likely ship), canned tuna or chicken breast   i like to have a good stock of these types of foods handy, as it helps fill in the missing macros.  but i do follow a pretty shitty version of IIFYM so if you are a clean/whatever eater than i can't help much sorry."

leangains,3cgk08,laere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"well for instance, today was bench day for me.  last week i hit 235x4, and backed off to 215x5 (upped from what would have been 210x5 because i stalled on top set last week).  so today i went out with all intention to crush 235x5.  well it didn't happen.  rep 5 was a bust.  so i took my 5 min rest and then got my backoff of 215x6.  so for 2 straight weeks i've stalled on my top set, however i progressed on my backoffs.  i chalk this up to a win (well for where i'm at now in my training).  next week i'll go for 235x5 and i'll probably get it."
leangains,3cgk08,joeeeeee_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:15:01 2015 UTC,"So you won't increase your top set to 240 until you hit 235x6 then? I am in the same situation, where my top set was 4 reps, but my back off was 6."

leangains,3cgk08,joeeeeee_,2,Thu Jul 9 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"Bulk. You've definitely made progress since you started, but you're not at a point where you have you have enough muscle mass to cut down to... Yet.  I'd suggest running your bench press as a 3x5 (3 sets of 5 reps) and hitting it every other workout. Each time you hit all 15 reps, add 2.5kg. This is called linear progression, and as a novice its the fastest way to make progress. You should be able to get your bench up to at least 93 kilos like this before progress begins to slow down, at which point you can keep moving up, just in smaller increments until you stall out.  Edit: you didn't ask, but consider swapping out that shoulder press machine for a standing overhead barbell press. It's a better exercise hands down, unless you have some sort of injury you're trying to work around."
leangains,3cgk08,wangston_huge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:24:59 2015 UTC,I began adding in standing press a couple of weeks ago  after my machine sets with the intent to transition to it when I felt confident enough. It definitely feels like a better exercise.

You're so close to being lean and you've only cut for a month, continue to cut for another month but give yourself a clear date so you don't fuck around. Cut and then slowly increase calories for a week or two till you reach maintenance, then eat around maintenance for a week or two, then slow bulk.   Since your bench is still low you should be working in the 6-8 rep range. You want to go in 2.5% increments and since you're only benching 175lbs then a 2.5% is less than 5lbs so you need to be able to get those extra reps to guarantee that when you go up that 5lbs that you'll hit at least 5 reps. Hope that makes sense."
leangains,3cdxjh,AbstractThinker,13,Tue Jul 7 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"Years of heavy lifting will take it's toll. But your average gym rat won't see it this way and will continue to push heavy weight until something  either tears or pops. For reference, tearing my pec wasn't a tickle!  I can see both sides. I'm 44 now. And I see young guys in their late teens and early 20's doing some outlandish stupid shit in the squat rack. Or pretty much any piece of equipment for that matter. Lifting weight way too heavy for them to control. But on the other side, I see plenty of young guys doing the opposite. Throwing around light weight with no change in their progression for months on end.   In the end, bodybuilding or powerlifting or pretty much lifting in general is a marathon, not a sprint. The trainer who plugs away at 80-90% intensity training intelligently will always beat out the trainer who smashes away at 110%. Gets burned out and quits or gets injured."

leangains,3cdxjh,valerius71,6,Tue Jul 7 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"I think as you get older, you learn to listen to your body. Check your ego at the door and take a rest when your joints are hurting. This is not an excuse to pussy out and take a week off because you missed a rep on your top set of squats. It'll be very individualistic. Some may be able to blast away for several weeks or months before taking a break. While others may only blast away for 4-6 weeks before needing a rest. Call it a deload or whatever.   The key from my perspective is to train smart. Some young guys don't. Definitely not all, as I'm sure there's plenty of examples of young guys who've got their shit together and train with intensity as well as intelligently. But with massive egos, some young guys will load up the bar and kill themselves and wonder why they plateau and don't get anywhere. The older guys who commented on your efforts at the gym sound like they speak from experience. But on the other hand, if they both look like they never lifted a weight in their lives and are giving out training tips, then by all means smile and nod then go back to what you were doing."

leangains,3cdxjh,cforres,-1,Tue Jul 7 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"I think stretching is good to get to a point where you can lift with good form and activate the right muscles during a certain lift, but over stretching CAN be harmful. For instance, I used to not be able to squat correctly because of flexibility in my ankle, so I had to put weights under my heel."
leangains,3cdxjh,Kartraith,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"I have problems with dorsal flexion as well in my ankles--but I also have tightness inside my inner thighs which is common from sitting a lot at a computer, or whatever. I think it also depends on the stretch. If you're just 'stretching' and not lengthening (which is different) then I agree entirely. You're just taking taking the tension out of the tendons. Before I squat I usually get down into a squat position and press out my knees to open myself up, but I also use my warm-ups to help with that as well."
leangains,3cdxjh,bms88,2,Tue Jul 7 14:47:12 2015 UTC,I often think about this as well.  I'm only 26 but I value my long term health and aesthetics way more than hitting 3/4/5 plates on my big 3 lifts.  I'm not really sure how to approach it other than continue using RPT until I reach my goal physique and then switch my training when I start trying to eat at maintenance.
leangains,3cdxjh,tenchichrono,0,Tue Jul 7 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"Wait, this doesn't make sense. Being aesthetic and long term health are inversely related lol unless we have different meanings of aesthetic  What kind of training are you gonna switch to after you reach goal physique?"
leangains,3cdxjh,CuriouslyCultured,3,Tue Jul 7 13:05:57 2015 UTC,"I think you can look great and have your long term health in mind.  I think I'll probably just come to realize its more related to diet compliance and lifestyle changes instead of how hard im lifting as I get older.  I don't know what I'm going to switch to after reaching my goal physique or if it'll even be necessary.    The low volume of RPT really appeals to me and on one hand leads me to believe that that will help longevity/long term health.  On the other hand, progressively loading the weight over the years will eventually lead to something giving out?  I dont know.  Now I'm arguing with myself.  Stop."

Honestly, it isn't that hard to get strong and muscular if you stay injury free.  The best way to maximize your gains is to do everything possible to avoid injuries.  For me, this means really long thorough warm-ups, and not going to failure when doing big compound exercises with heavy weight.  I'll still train to failure when doing isolation and ""small"" compound exercises for higher reps though."
leangains,3cdxjh,qqqyqnz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:51:51 2015 UTC,That's the beauty of RPT! The low volume decreases injury risk. I bet these guys were doing 3 sets of 10 or to absolute failure with heavy weight which will without a doubt wear down your body after training for years.

leangains,3cdxjh,qqqyqnz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:53:50 2015 UTC,I would heed their advice in the regard of making sure you have perfect technique in your lifts. I fucked up my back power cleaning almost 10 years ago due to poor technique mixed with too heavy of weight and am reminded daily of it.   If you're lifting heavy weights but using good technique I'd say your safe; but just be honest with yourself if you're controlling the weight or its controlling you.
leangains,3cdxjh,der_brajmang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"I can totally see what they're saying, maybe they just didn't explain it that well to you. When I first started at the gym if I could move a weight I would use it, did end up causing a few minor injuries I was luckily able to prevent from becoming too serious.  But I've learned there's a difference between weights you can move and weights that train your muscles to grow. Yeah, I could bench 90 Dumbbells for some reps, but a lot of that pressure is being put on places other than my target muscles (joints, shoulders, etc). My chest has grown a lot more since I've dropped the weight significantly (55-60 pound DBs) and really stretched for that full range of motion.  Also make sure you are doing plenty of rear delt and external rotation exercises (Facepulls and rear delt flys) to avoid benchers shoulder, and when you bench make sure your elbows are ~45 degrees from your body so you aren't putting unnecessary strain on your shoulders (from you elbows sticking too far out). Also note for chest activation on dumbbell press its best to start with the Dumbbells parallel to your body and at the top of the motion have the ends of the Dumbbells meet.  Tl;dr just because you can move big weights doesn't mean you should (for injuries and muscle growth)"

But if you've signed up for a powerlifting meet, or if you've entered a 12 week transformation contest, or if you've got a beach vacation booked and paid for, then suddenly you have a very real deadline and you are far more likely to escape permacut land."

That being said, I've had phenomenal results with short bulk/cut cycles.  I'm currently doing weekly cycles where I am around 1000 under maintenance Monday through Thursday, and about 500 over maintenance Friday through Sunday.  If you aren't in a hurry to lose weight (I'm still at nearly a pound loss per week) this method is great."
leangains,3cc3h2,nixx1338,8,Mon Jul 6 19:53:33 2015 UTC,So the unlucky workouts in the Mon - Thu window get hit by a 1k deficit as well? Why not just +500 on workout days -1000 on rest days? Provided you lift 3 times a week you end up with the same numbers.

I started out at 4, and I added a day here and there and tracked the results.  Every time I added an extra training day, my rate of progress increased.  It's been smooth sailing, though I've had to do one ~3 week deload where I dropped to 4x a week to recover from fatigue/injuries."
leangains,3cc3h2,yallrcunts,2,Mon Jul 6 21:47:41 2015 UTC,I guess we aren't talking about the same kind of training then. I could never do really intense heavy sets for 7 days a week. I think my body would break in half.

When I go and lift near 90% of my max that is what I call a work out. If you are capable of doing that day in and day out and make steady progress then congratulations--you should write book about it.  Even world-class powerlifters and body-builders take days off, unless they are on steroids. Then who cares? If you are then don't compare our work ethics. I would squat until my legs fell off if it meant they would just always grow.  How do you have so much time on your hands to just sleep 10 hours (I can't do more than 6)?

Unless I am misunderstanding this. I was a triathlete, and I still do train for endurance, and strength. And there is no way I could do what you're proposing, but I also haven't had a good nights sleep in probably 5 years. So maybe I don't know what I am capable of if I could sleep properly. If you could just give me an idea of your work-out I could get a grasp on what you're talking about. I don't even care about numbers."

leangains,3cc3h2,bluebelt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:47:59 2015 UTC,I just finished an unintended four year bulk. Weight was gained. The last 8 months of cutting have also had some measurable results.
leangains,3cc3h2,ehmbie,6,Tue Jul 7 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"I think what really clicked for me was two things:  1) Having a sustainable weekly caloric goal, tracking calories meticulously and making certain that I am hitting it as close as possible each week (sometimes one needs to ballpark, I don't lose any sleep if I might be 500ish calories off).   2) Weighed myself at the same time each day, record it in the MFP app. You should be seeing your predicted weight loss on a bi-weekly basis. If you aren't seeing your predicted weight loss then one of two things are happening: you didn't hit your caloric goal (shouldn't happen if you followed step one) or your caloric goal is too high and needs to be lowered.  So many times I didn't see the expected progress on the scale and I'd feed myself some broscience excuse like ""Oh my fat is being replaced with muscle"" or ""Creatine, carb intake, salt intake, blah blah water retention"". No, two weeks without progress then you aren't losing fat and something needs to change.  Now some theory for fun. I'd say the majority of ""permacutters"" are missing step one. They are ""dieting"", but not counting calories (my roommate). They are probably trying to roughly keep track in their heads, but maybe 2000 cals today? Maybe 2500? Hey close enough right? Nope, plan what you are eating that day and eat that. You are fat because your body does not self-regulate it's intake very well, you cannot eat as you go and try to add everything up, you will overestimate. On occasion they actually feel hunger, and assume that certainly this means they are eating few enough calories to lose weight.  Another large sect would be the ""cheat-day"" (binge) crowd, formerly myself. They understand the principle of calories in vs out, but have no concept of muscle retention or diet sustainability. They create a massive, borderline-unhealthy caloric deficit that would probably kill them in a few months if they were able to stick to it. This is often accompanied by intense cardio. Eventually the bodies survival instinct breaks their will, this is their cheat day, a 6000 calorie food orgy of pizza and ice cream. Surely one day of excess cannot undo a week of extreme deprivation? Yep, it can."

I honestly don't think if you have a ""food orgy"" one day out of the week and the rest of the days you are in an extreme deficit, that it will undo your progress from the week.  Problem is most of those people have a binge more than one day a week and in that case you're screwing yourself.  I understand your point though. unhealthy, unsustainable diet anyway"
leangains,3cc3h2,CaffeineExperiment,2,Tue Jul 7 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"It will certainly look like it's undone the week the next morning. Of course, that will come off in due time.   I haven't had a cheat day per se in the 9 or so weeks I've been cutting properly but on Saturday I was going out to dinner with family for maybe the first time in that period. Planned my day the night before, chose a menu item ahead of time that fit my macros (fillet mignon), aimed for a good buffer below maintenance, still 4-500kcal above my normal rest day.   Got to the restaurant and ended up with a bigger than expected salad bar plate and said 'stuff it'. Had some birthday cake. Decided to top off the night with a shot of port, but was offered 200ml for $4. Guesstimate of 2-300kcal over maintenance. Next morning weigh in was 1kg above the day before. Strict adherence (no making up for it) since then. I'm now ~1.3kg below that high reading, and it's Tuesday.   If I'd given up after seeing Sunday's measurement I'd have done myself a disservice. I had a great night out Saturday. It reminded me how easy it is to blast straight past maintenance for the day. Doing that too often is why I was obese."

Especially if they're at an extreme deficit like you said. That 6-8 thousand or more calorie day just wiped out whatever progress you made for the week. Maybe even gained some fat if the binge is bad enough.

I'll have like 50-100ish grams of both carbs and protein which is reasonable for a meal and sustainable in the long term.   I guess my question is whether I should try to get the rest before I go to work out (as it would be on the standard workout macro and rest macro split, since that's a workout day) or wait until the next day and have a carb heavy, higher calorie meal for that next day's lunch, around 2 or so, which would be unconventional since thats technically a rest day."

If you're more advanced, that will be too much volume and take too much time per workout, so just keep increasing weight on those lifts with RPT.

leangains,3cakpv,Bakaichi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yohimbine will help release fatty acids into the bloodstream but if you don't use them they just go right back into the fat cells. So unless you're pairing your yohimbine with some LISS or something, you're mostly wasting money. An insulin spike will basically turn the yohimbine off, but I really doubt you're eating massive amounts of gum immediately following taking yohimbine. Take the yohimbine, do some LISS 60m later, and then eat your gum and you won't have anything to worry about."

leangains,3cakpv,Bakaichi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:51:24 2015 UTC,"Y has two effects that we want to benefit from.   Acutely it will cause the release of fatty acids into the blood stream (as a stimulant similar to caffeine). Insulin blunts this effect, so you want to avoid a spike until you've had a chance to use those fatty acids for energy.  Chronically it builds up in the ""stubborn"" fat cells and helps prevent them from storing fatty acids to some degree. Here insulin doesn't really matter. It's just a matter of taking it regularly so that it builds up in the cells.  Whether you go for one or both effects is up to you, but neither is going to make much difference if you aren't already fairly lean. These are all considerations when judging the cost/benefit ratio of using Y."

leangains,3cakpv,Bakaichi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say you're wasting your money. Caffeine will do the job until you actually make it to stubborn fat. That probably won't be until 10% or less.  That said, I like to use it as motivation sometimes. One, I know I'll walk at least an hour every day to make the most of it. So it helps speed things up in that sense. Two, it puts me in the cut mindset, which helps me be consistent/content with a lower intake since I'm investing in it. So I use it as a mental hack, in which case your bf% doesn't really matter.  In other words, totally up to you, but you'll get the most bang for your buck when you're much leaner."

It depends on how you respond, how long you'll be doing LISS, etc. Personally, 45-60 min seemed to work best for me. It takes time for the fatty acids to hit the blood stream, but if your LISS session is going to be really long then 20-30 mins should be plenty."

leangains,3cakpv,simple_mech,5,Wed Jul 8 03:54:33 2015 UTC,"Can it be as effective? Sure, otherwise it Norton wouldn't vouch for it. Is is as efficient? No because I'd define efficiency as results vs time invested. You'll be investing A LOT more time with PHAT than with RPT."
leangains,3cakpv,GetThatCrown,0,Tue Jul 14 03:33:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with the efficiency 100%. However, I personally enjoy the time I spend at the gym so much that working out 2 extra days for a bit better (or even the same) results sounds great to me. But it's great to hear that the effectivity isn't a problem with the PHAT + LG combo, thanks!"
leangains,3cakpv,simple_mech,2,Mon Jul 6 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"The only issue I'd see is you can't have low calorie days. To be honest you can't really do LG if you more working out 6 days/week. Why not follow RPT and do something more productive with your time?   You like being at the gym because you're used to it and possibly good at it. Find a more productive hobby and you'll start liking to do that. There's a lot of activities; yoga, biking, dance (I know it sounds funny but it's quite a useful life skill), some form of martial arts, etc. Those are just active activities but there's a lot more you could do which aren't as active."
leangains,3cakpv,tontyboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:46:57 2015 UTC,You're right that there are more productive ways to spend my time but I guess the reason why I enjoy lifting so much is that training hard gives me time to not think about anything and recharge for my job/other affairs where I have to stay on top of my game mentally. In my current city hitting the gym is one of the most convenient active hobbies as e.g. biking requires traveling a bit further to get rid of the traffic.  I really appreciate your input - for some reason asking anything that contradicts the FAQ here seems to get downvoted into oblivion quite fast.

leangains,3cakpv,cforres,2,Mon Jul 6 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"Sensible IIFYM: lots of vegetables/fiber/meat/good fats on rest days while trying to eat as many whole grain carbs as possible on lift days, but I don't particularly care if there is a spike in sugar, etc. The impact seems minimal and eating bland shit day in day out is simply not sustainable (for me). I look forward to my huge bowl of post-workout oatmeal with whatever I feel like eating that day."
leangains,3cakpv,8edroomEyes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:29:29 2015 UTC,I always start with a 300 calorie bowl of oatmeal then start adding stuff and eat it. Then I plug things into MFP and somehow end up around 800 calories like shit!

Personally I rely on a variation of super clean on rest days plus IIFYM on workout days (for mental satisfaction and diet compliance).
leangains,3cakpv,Freddy_Mac,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:20 2015 UTC,I eat clean with a dirty snack here and there. IIFYM for special occasions. Much harder to stay clean on a bulk
leangains,3cakpv,simple_mech,2,Mon Jul 6 19:00:25 2015 UTC,IIFYM does not equal not clean. Only fools actually try to eat pure junk with IIFYM. IIFYM just means it's okay to indulge occasionally on your otherwise mostly healthy diet.

I'm planning on eating at around a 10% deficit (300 calories) on workout days, with a larger deficit, like 20-25% (600-700 calories) on rest days. Does this make any sense? Any tweaks I should consider?"
leangains,3cakpv,aesthetic-as-fuck,2,Mon Jul 6 18:56:49 2015 UTC,"If you're really at 13%, which you're probably not, simply because most people underestimate BF when they start, but if you ARE, you might want to cut a bit more slowly. You'll lose muscle as you start to get down to 10%.  Also, on a cut, I'd strongly suggest not weight training 6x a week. You'll only fatigue yourself and your gains won't be any better. Do compound movements 3x a week and get more rest in."

leangains,3cbf7a,Sockin,3,Mon Jul 6 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"I believe Martin said that it's best to get starchy carbs post-workout rather than from simple sugars. I will try to find where I saw that.  Honestly though, it probably doesn't make a huge difference. It's one of those little things that you might want to worry about if you're doing everything else perfectly, but for most people it's not a big deal."
leangains,3cbf7a,Peckerdick,4,Mon Jul 6 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"Sugar causes less of an insulin response than an equal portion of starchy carbs.  Sugar is also less efficient at restoring muscle glycogen (though it is better at restoring liver glycogen).  Additionally, elevated glucose concentrations trigger expression of genes for anabolism, while fructose (which makes up half of sugar) does not have this effect.  Some sugar is okay, particularly when you are breaking your fast, or after working out;  I'd limit it to 30-40g.  Outside of these times, you are going to have better results from starchy carbs."
leangains,3cbf7a,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:00:48 2015 UTC,So a good size meal with rice/pasta/potatos/other carbs + a bit of ice cream. Sounds good to me.

leangains,3cbf7a,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:45:10 2015 UTC,In theory anything above 100-120g will turn into fat.
leangains,3cbf7a,hiroshi-ma2,2,Mon Jul 6 16:58:19 2015 UTC,What? That makes no sense. The only time carbs are stored as fat is when the calories are eaten in excess of your TDEE.
leangains,3cbf7a,Peckerdick,5,Mon Jul 6 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"You are limited by your body's storage of glycogen (liver). Anything that surpasses that will turn into fat. This is why Martin and Andy recommend prioritizing meats & starches and saving dessert for last. I also remember Martin mentioning how your cereals shouldn't have a cartoon character on them (because of the high sugar content).  I said in theory because despite all of the claims, there are some people who are eating sugary crap regularly and still reaching single digits in body fat."
leangains,3cbf7a,hiroshi-ma2,3,Mon Jul 6 17:38:40 2015 UTC,but he also ate a box of special k a day
leangains,3cbf7a,onurgkuk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:12:01 2015 UTC,An entire box of Special K cereal has ~65g of sugar. The same box of Froot Loops has ~205g (and a fraction of the protein).
leangains,3cbf7a,hiroshi-ma2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the liver could store up to 120g, but the muscles could store somewhere in the ballpark of 350g. Is that not correct? Or is it different with sugar vs. carbs?"
leangains,3cbf7a,flyingjay2121,2,Tue Jul 7 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"My first comment that got downvoted, I mention that anything above 100-120g gets turned into fat (in theory). Your muscle can store ~350-400, and maybe a little bit more.  Fructose (fruits or a food sweetened with sugar, agave syrup or high-fructose corn syrup) on the other hand can only be metabolized by the liver. Majority of those kid cereals are enhanced with high-fructose corn syrup. So someone who is eating a lot of sugar (ice cream, poptarts, kid cereals, chocolate, honey, maple syrup & other crap) can technically gain fat, even when in a caloric deficit."
leangains,3cbf7a,hiroshi-ma2,2,Tue Jul 7 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"I think I'm confused. I was saying that the liver could only store 120g, but it looks like you're saying it can only metabolize 120g. When the liver metabolizes sugar, does it have to store it immediately, or can it release it for immediate use?"
leangains,3cbf7a,flyingjay2121,3,Tue Jul 7 19:08:48 2015 UTC,"As far as I understand Glucose goes into your muscles and liver, but the majority of it goes into the bloodstream for cell regeneration. When it comes to Fructose, the only organ that deals with it is the liver.  The liver will turn a small portion of the fructose into glucose while the majority of it is stored as byproduct…anything above the 100-120g average. Some sources say that the number is as low as 90g. It’s best to avoid sodas and other empty calories as much as possible. Martin even mentioned this before.  A moderately large bowl of FrootLoops, 1 Hershey’s chocolate bar & ½ cup of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and you’re at ~100g. Any additional sugar intake will spill-over to fat (assuming your liver was depleted and had room in the first place).   Martin mentioned that it takes about 40h of fasting until the liver is completely depleted. But at that 40h muscle catabolism is at its highest. A 16h fast combined with fasted exercise will help deplete the liver glycogen but I am under the impression that even though your liver can hold up to 120g, you are not starting each day with 0g. So limit sugar consumption as much as possible for optimal results."
leangains,3cbf7a,hiroshi-ma2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:27:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for clarifying. Always appreciate the info.
leangains,3cbf7a,flyingjay2121,3,Tue Jul 7 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"You would, but you would lose it faster if you didn't consume the excess sugar.  You can also think of it as limiting strength and muscle gains. By consuming fructose over glucose you are not giving the fuel your body needs for recovery, muscle building and strength.  Don't ask, will this work? but rather, will this work optimally?"
leangains,3cbf7a,hiroshi-ma2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"You're not taking into account energy expenditure needs of the many other processes your body needs energy for.  Any cellular respiration requires energy in one form of another.  If your total energy intake, REGARDLESS of source, does not meet your body's energy requirements that excess energy will be pulled from fat.  I don't see any sources on sugars slowing down fat loss so we'll have to take your word on that, but if your brain or autonomic nervous system requires energy to function IT WILL get that energy from what's most readily available.  If there is glucose available it will use that. If there isn't enough glucose then lipids will be converted into acetyl-CoA which will be used in the Krebs cycle for energy in the same way carbs are used. The result is a net loss in fat since the adipose cells will shrink with the loss of lipids.  Edit: I read your comment again and I somewhat see what you're getting at. Since that excess sugar is more easily use able than lipids the body will continue to use thay for energy until depleted.  However, if that excess sugar doesn't meet expenditure needs than fat will still be used."
leangains,3cbf7a,ArtigoQ,-1,Tue Jul 7 21:35:46 2015 UTC,what the fuck did I just read -.-
leangains,3cbf7a,caryc,2,Thu Jul 9 13:46:09 2015 UTC,"He partially correct, once liver glycogen stores are full, the primary pathway for disposal of fructose is via conversion to palmitic acid (a saturated fatty acid).  This is how high sugar intake results in elevated triglycerides and VLDL.  That doesn't mean that the synthesized triglyceride will end up in an adipocyte resulting in increased adiposity.  If you are in enough of a deficit that fat could just be taken up by muscle and used for fuel."
leangains,3cbf7a,CuriouslyCultured,0,Mon Jul 6 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"Generally simple sugars will have a higher glycemic index, and will be absorbed into your blood faster (causing your blood sugar and insulin levels to spike). I don't think it makes a difference in terms of muscle growth, but I find that I'll ""feel better"" from eating starchy, complex carbs - that is why 100g of carbs from carrots doesn't make you feel like 100g of carbs from ice cream. Anyways if you feel fine (no lethargy, etc.) then I think you should be fine as you are. Personally if I break a fast with a bunch of sugar I get super tired."
leangains,3cbf7a,qqqyqnz,0,Mon Jul 6 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"My understanding, is that the optimal time to eat sugar is in a +/- two hour window of a strenuous workout in combination with fast digesting protein and other carbs.  (Chocolate Milk!)        This will result in a greater uptake of glycogen into the muscle because the fructose (and lactose) carbs will replenish liver glycogen preferentially, leaving more glucose in the bloodstream for uptake into the muscles.    Also, both protein digestion and strenuous exercise should raise glucagon levels in the bloodstream, which will cause the liver to release stored glycogen; effectively creating some level of immediate conversion of fructose into bloodstream glucose."
leangains,3c8rvs,frendargolargo,14,Sun Jul 5 23:33:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure where or if Martin ever said this. I guess this post has derailed into bulk vs cut while skinny-fat discussion, I'll throw my 2 cents in.  There's really nothing ""skinny"" about skinny-fat. It's fat without much muscle. I'm someone who has been moderately fat (25-30% BF) and skinny-fat. I started a bulk around ~20% BF and was not happy with the results at all. My lifts were progressing well, but after a month I looked worse than when I started, very discouraging. I switched to cutting and I am down to ~15% BF.  I'm still pretty weak by this subs standards, but my lifts go up little by little and I'm thrilled with the results in the mirror. I guess the only people I'd recommend bulk are the truly skinny (<12 BF) and those whose main goal is getting stronger (wants to make the football team even if it means getting a little fatter). If physique is your main concern, cut first."

Before I transition to the bulk I'll make a progress post with pics. I had some great starting photos from about a year ago with my shirt off but I deleted them accidentally. My before photo is going to have to be from facebook or something, I'll clearly be pretty fat, but it won't demonstrate just how skinny-fat I was, kind of a bummer."
leangains,3c8rvs,ehmbie,8,Tue Jul 7 13:09:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with Martin.    No one has issues bulking.  Everyone fights cutting and even hardcore leaners have issues sticking to muscle retention during a cut.  If a client can do a cut properly AND keep their workout goals, they'll look and feel better when it is time for their first bulk."
leangains,3c8rvs,abdada,7,Mon Jul 6 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree with you on this point. I find it much easier to lose weight than to gain. I've always been a smaller guy, and I find it really simple to track calories while eating at a deficit, but eating a surplus makes me miserable most of the time... I do it, cuz gains, but blanket statements like this aren't necessarily accurate   Edit: when I said calories I meant macros."
leangains,3c8rvs,ChrisHooked,2,Mon Jul 6 05:22:35 2015 UTC,I also find it easier for me to cut than bulk.  But most people are the opposite.

leangains,3c8rvs,tontyboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"I've encouraged a lot of skinny fat guys to try leangains for 6 months and almost all of them have gotten much leaner and much stronger.  IF is ""easy"" once you adapt.  That part is nothing.  And once you're adapted, cutting is pretty easy because you finally get leptin and ghrelin under control.  If someone can cut, then bulking with a rigorous monitoring of calorie intake and body weight comes pretty naturally, I think.  I've seen guys go from 250# fat to 220# leanish with muscles in those 6 months and none of them are professionals by any means.  Most could only get to the gym 2-3x per week.  Getting fat is of course easier, but with IF and a little bit of math, a slow bulk appears to be easier than any other method once you get your hunger hormones in check."

leangains,3c8rvs,Peckerdick,3,Mon Jul 6 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on you and your goals. I started working out with this goal in mind, I wanted to be 10-12%BF before I even thought about bulking. But I got down to around 15% and didn't like how I looked, since I didn't have much muscle definition. Being a single guy and it being summer, I want to look good as I can as quickly as I can, and decided that a lean bulk is the way to do it.  If I were more patient, or if I wasn't single or if it was winter, I would probably have cut down to 10-12%BF before bulking."

If you can get stronger and build muscle all while cutting fat in the beginning stages of lifting, then why would someone choose to do the opposite.  Most skinny fats that I know have no history of lifting. They  are prime for building muscle  whether they bulk or cut. Also,  I find it much easier to calculate my true TDEE on a cut.

IMO it's not even a debate, if your lifts are not mid to high intermediate closing in on advanced, you need to bulk first period.   You don't have to get all fat in the process but you need to at least make your lifts increasing your main focus. And it needs to be for several months at least.   You can almost make it a recomp environment with leangains if you have a slight deficit and are walking on your rest days staying active.   Cutting while skinny fat is a long long long LONG uphill battle. If you read starting strength (I know he's a strength coach but he's still VERY experienced) Mark Rippetoe suggests all people start out bulking regardless of ther current body fat, even drinking a gallon of milk a day (which might seem reckless but even makes more sense to me now that I've been bulking for a while, counting exact calories and macros doesn't seem as optimal all the time as opposed to flooding yourself with calories haha)   I definitely say bulk and eat ALOT of calories on training days, you can get away with a modest deficit on rest days with some active recovery and might even make it a bit of a recomp for a while with newbie gains.   You just need to add muscle first before cutting it makes life so much easier and you'll feel like a man in the gym."

Each person has their threshold. Start at a 500 calorie deficit and track your weight and visually track your body. Take pictures weekly, if you're losing weight and fat, keep doing what you're doing. If you're not, scale down your calories for a greater deficit.  Each body is different, I personally run a 1000 calorie deficit and feel fine and am seeing great results. You may be different. Try giving 500 a calorie deficit for a few weeks and see how it goes, no amount of advice here can make up for trial and error.  It won't be easy, but if you stick with it you'll be incredibly happy with what you've done. Best of luck to you man and make sure to track your progress for yourself and us! Can't wait to see how it works out for you."

When you're trying to lose weight you really shouldn't go too below your daily expenditure in calories. And when you build muscle your muscles will burn extra calories.

It's a safe assumption that the heavier you lift the more type 2 mf will be called (I imagine atleast 60% of the MF in use will be type 2( I actually don't know what ~% of type 2 MF would be used)).  In the article I linked it states "" In a typical muscle, the largest MNs are not even recruited until the muscle has generated about 50% of its peak force capacity.""

Doing 3x5 or 3x10 won't make a difference in hypertrophy in general (as stated in detail of your source); but, doing 3x5 and 3x10 could rip more muscle fibers of both types. There are two important quotes to take note of in your source:   ""even though muscle growth is the same. This could be due to a variety of factors that as of yet are unexplored in the literature: neural adaptations to specific loads, fiber type specific hypertrophy, aerobic/anaerobic adaptations in muscle fibers, and so on.""  ""There are a couple of studies looking at muscle fiber types in drug-free competitive weightlifters(15) and powerlifters,(16) and the fiber type ratios are very similar. A few more studies have looked at bodybuilder fiber types and found a very high ratio of type I fibers,(17,18) but they were done on high-level, untested competitors and had exceedingly small sample sizes, so the likely drug use and other factors such as different muscle groups in the different studies make it difficult to draw conclusions. In addition, none of the studies examining fiber types are training studies, so the actual effect of certain rep ranges on the fiber types would be impossible to know anyway.""  If you take a look at his references (15-18) you will see in general that rep/sets effect on MF composition is inconclusive. Although it's uncertain wether or not doing low and high reps will stimulate more overall muscle growth I think it has the highest potential."

Low iron is more of a problem for woman who have periods.  Unless you are bleeding out significant amounts of blood every month than you are probably micro managing this problem too much.

So basically I'm eating about 120 grams of protein per day, all in 1 meal with maybe a couple quest bars around 1-2pm to stave off hunger.  It's a bit of an adjustment for me mainly because I've been getting bored and thinking about food during the day.  The weird thing is that I no longer even think about breakfast any more so I think it will take some time to stop thinking about food all day until I finally get to eat.  At that point the diet will be on auto-pilot.  That's the main reason I'm not tracking calories right now - I'm looking at these first few weeks or maybe even the entire 10-12 weeks I plan on cutting as simply training myself to get used to eating later.  Once I'm there mentally, if I'm not happy with the results, then I'll get a lot more strict on counting macros and calories the next cycle."

Increasing the weight at 6 reps is good, but probably look at increasing it by 10% as opposed to 5. 31min's recommendation for the second set is to drop the weight by 10% and perform one more rep.   edit: formatting"

Hit your minimum daily requirements for fat and protein and fill up the rest of the calories as you please. Fill up the remaining calories with cake or ice cream if you wish!  His: Hit your minimum fat and protein requirement and make carbs the remaining focus.  His fat intake is 0.3-0.6g/lbs, where I used 0.45g/lbs, which is the average of those two numbers. He uses 1g/lbs of protein whereas I use the non-rounded minimum of 0.82g/lbs.  tl;dr - He prefers carbs and choses his macros based on that.

I would step on a scale once a day or every other day because the general trend is more important than how much you way at any one moment in time.* risky to change your body too quickly: yes, that is general advice for a general population. Some people make a New Year's resolution, cut their calories drastically, start doing a ridiculous amount of cardio and then pass out in the gym (see: paramedics in NYC gyms around February). If you are informed and reasonable then it isn't dangerous to lose weight at a decent rate, especially if you are overweight. Rebound: just the act of going off a diet won't make you lose weight. Here is what happens: suppose you are 200lb, your TDEE is 2300 and your weight is steady (eating maintenance week to week). You drop weight to 160lb through calorie restriction, then go off your diet. If you eat how you ate before, an average of 2300 calories a day, you'll gain weight again because your TDEE is lower. This happens because people don't control themselves after they go off a diet and just fall into old habits. The tendency to 'rebound' is a lack of control not a side effect from cutting. If you readjust your calories after a cut you shouldn't gain any weight.   *Edit: here is my scale protocol: I weigh myself on mornings I go to the gym at 6a. I pee, have the smallest sip of water to swallow my vitamins, bike over and weigh myself before starting. I also use a tape measure to check my body fat percentage, which is not the most accurate method but good for seeing general trends. I didn't mean to be discouraging, it's just hard to see whether you really lost weight after a week. You won't drop 5kg every week, maybe 1-1.5kg, so just don't be discouraged if you don't see the same progress next week."

It took me a really long time to start taking my health seriously and I really don't like the idea of not being able to do things with my kids because of a physical restriction I have some control over. Before I started my weight loss journey I couldn't fit an airplane seat belt across my lap, I couldn't ride a go-cart because I would press up against the steering wheel on a full size cart making it difficult to steer etc etc etc. There's so many things I can't do that I enjoyed doing when I was a kid and I'm sure my kids will also and I want to be a part of that. I grew up with an obese parent and I know the feeling of not wanting to invite friends over for fear of them judging me over the way my mum looked (I should mention that I was always fit and healthy up until I was 18).

Rest Days:   8:00AM  1 cup of Green Tea  12:00PM  Break the fast with meal 1(largest meal, approx 60%+ of total calories)   7:00PM  Meal 2  Workout Days:   8:00AM  1 cup of Green Tea  12:00AM  Break fast with Meal 1 (30% of calories consumed)  2:00PM  Take BCAA. Gym.   5:00PM  Meal 2 (Majority of calories consumed here)   7:00PM  Meal 3(Optional if I feel like I'm not fully satiated from Meal 2)   If your issue is figuring out how to control your hunger then just drinking lots of water and eating lots of fiber will do the trick for you. My suggestion is to feel comfortable with keeping a bottled water or even a jug of water near you at all times. As for fiber suggestions, oatmeal with a dash of salt is simply amazing."

leangains,3byoyx,newmanofwisdom,5,Fri Jul 3 06:11:52 2015 UTC,"Will it significantly diminish the benefits of leangains that come with fasting?   No one will be able to answer that for certain. Fasting is not an on/off switch which will be triggered by any amount of calories (generally accepted to be okay if <50, but that's not an exact science), but the fact that you're eating a small breakfast brings to question why you're fasting in the first place.  It's your first week of fasting. You're used to eating a breakfast in the morning and have most likely been doing so your entire life, so of course you're going to initially experience hunger pangs. If your solution to these hunger pangs is eating a small breakfast then you're going to become dependent on that small breakfast, which diminishes a major benefits to fasting - the convenience of not having to worry about food.   Leangains doesn't have to be a black and white - fasting vs non-fasting - but regardless I'd recommend that you ditch the small breakfast and let your body adjust to the fasting. Caffeine (black tea/coffee) & water can help a lot when you first start.   TL;DR-  Ditch the small breakfast and let your body adjust. If it's >50 calories it's considered breaking the fast - and regardless you're missing out on (in my opinion) the greatest benefit to leangains - convenience."
leangains,3byoyx,musclehacking,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:36:10 2015 UTC,"Black coffee, no sugar or cream else you may as well eat breakfast. But yeah, ditch breakfast. It'll take a few weeks to adjust and then you'll be fine."

leangains,3byoyx,MegaLeon,2,Fri Jul 3 06:21:51 2015 UTC,The hunger pangs and growling subsides eventually. Stop consuming calories before you have your meal that breaks the fast. Once you adjust you will be able to fast for 16+ hours easily. I was doing 16 hour fasts for the past feww months and in the past few weeks I've completely switched to 22-24 hour fasts every day and am now eating one meal a day and i love it. Was very easy to make the switch to 24h fasts.

I have learned how to experience feelings of slight hunger as normal and appropriate, rather than distressing. I'm much happier with that psychological state. In other words, being a bit hungry sometimes is not a bad thing, it's a good thing.  2) I used to be WAY hungrier, right when I first started. It took my body a good month to get fully adjusted, and my mind continued adapting long after that.  3) Eating 1 meal a day is very different than eating two meals at either end of an 8-hour window.  4) That's a small sample size.

Otherwise, even if you're good on calories your body is still expecting food at 6pm or whatever when your gigantic ""dinner"" was at 12.  I remember having a hard time with 16/8, and now eating over 8 hours feels like sloth and gluttony, as if I'm just eating constantly all day long.

I am less hungry in the day than I have ever been, despite taking in very few calories. As long as I get 1800-2500 calories overall (I am female, fyi), it doesn't seem to matter if I eat barely anything for most of the day."
leangains,3bvwj1,only_spoons,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it might be tough for eight weeks. Switching dietary habits after a potential lifetime isn't easy. But LG isn't exactly a 'quick fix' solution, if you can't make it through the transition period then this program isn't for you.  In the beginning I used to be hungry at night and practically lethargic after my first meal in the morning (fasted from noon to 8am). Now I am energized throughout the day, especially during my fasting period. I still get the occasional hunger pang but that is normal whether you're on a plan or not - it's just how you teach yourself to deal with it that changes."

Interesting.  One would think that fat loss would decrease blood pressure/cholesterol, especially with decreased cortisol.  I'm not going to attempt to disprove the study because IANA scientist.  I try to remain unbiased about such things, and trying to disprove a study is rather biased.  It's nifty that IF induces ""reductions in fat mass"" even at maintenance, though.  Feeling a desire to eat everything in sight at the end of a fast seems perfectly natural--and it's one of the benefits that I can do that.  There's nothing like packing a day's worth of calories into a single meal.  Overall, intermittent fasting works for me, so that's all I care about."

leangains,3bwozw,MaybePenisTomorrow,4,Thu Jul 2 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"I would follow your brothers advice. There are two major reasons to train more frequently than what that board suggests and those are you get to practice your form with more frequency and your body is at the peak supercompensation after about 24-48 hours (i.e. you're ready to do the same workout and make more strength gains). For the most part, as long as you are consuming excess calories, strength gains are followed by mass gains.   You should do something like 5x5 or starting strength."

leangains,3bwozw,Maester_erryk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:49:41 2015 UTC,"This guy is an absolute beginner based on his comment and the pics. Those two programs are perfect programs for someone in that situation.   Yes a beginner should do a beginner based routine.  Most good beginner routines will focus around the compound movements.  No routine focuses on form but a person should always be working on form, whether it be a beginner learning to squat to parallel or an elite level lifter trying to master their technique.  Some people may argue certain routines are better for learning form than others, a routine with a higher number of working reps for example should teach a person form faster but there is no reason a person can not do lots and lots of light sub maximal work to focus on technique.   I suppose in terms of lifting heavy you mean relative to what the person can do, I have no problems with that as a beginner has so much progression due to CNS adaption it seems every session they can see a new 5rm etc.  Linear progression is also advised as it seems the most optimal way for a beginner to progress and should keep the person motivated as they do more each session however a program like ICF also has linear progression so linear progression isn't only in strength based routines...   Noob gains will be abound and they are both easy programs to learn and stick to which will help to develop good habits and ultimately, discipline.   My point wasn't these these aren't good programs but just that they are not optimal for OP.  Any program can help instill habit and discipline.   Most programs are also easy to stick to.  The fact is OP wants to cosplay as spiderman in september, if he does SS he will average 22.5 reps of bench press a week, that clearly isn't optimal.   I did SS and absolutely loved it but I was training for strength."
leangains,3bwozw,johnfarrellfitness,4,Fri Jul 3 12:30:48 2015 UTC,"based on your goal physique i think if you really busted ass and stayed 100% to the diet and training, you might get close to that by late sept.  i had similar starting stats to you prior to getting on a real training program.  and when i finally got on SL5x5 and held strict to a  deficit diet (was doing keto then, but still had my newb gains to make anyway) i saw some pretty amazing results in about 75 days.    i also have the same family history with high blood pressure and lots of cardiac issues.  unfortunately i have also been told most of them were life time smokers, and obese for a long time so can't say how much of those factors are truly genetic or lifestyle induced.  if high blood pressure is the concern, you may want to try cutting a bit and dropping the body weight 5-10 lbs and seeing how your resting rate reacts.    regardless get on a real program ASAP.  your link you provided is just over complicating it.  you don't need to do that many different exercises per muscle group at your stage.  your body will likely respond much better to the barbell compound lifts.  stick to ICF 5x5, SL5x5, or the like."

Check out /r/fitness and read everything in their sidebar. Figure out your macros and ask your brother for help with that. You guys can cook meals together which would cut down work a lot.

Doing some kind of resistance training during that time to preserve muscle mass is good, but the specifics of the program aren't too important. In 2.5 months, it's much easier to lose enough bodyfat to make an aesthetic difference than it is to gain enough muscle to make an aesthetic difference. And if you attempt the latter, you'll almost certainly add an unwanted amount of bodyfat in the process.  Regarding endurance, I'd suggest running. Long, slow runs 4-5 times per week will make you much more aerobically fit in a very short period of time. If you have to break up the runs with walk breaks, that's fine. Focus on keeping your pace slow, just slightly on the other side of comfortable."
leangains,3bvnie,Osterik,4,Thu Jul 2 15:01:53 2015 UTC,This may sound mean but it doesn't seem like you have too much muscle to worry about losing from doing only cardio for a few weeks.  Just do what you can and get back at it when you're healed.   This would be a good time to work on your mobility so you can get after that squat form.
leangains,3bvnie,slayer49,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"The fact that I don't have a great deal of muscle was precisely my concern, I didn't want to go through the effort of cutting to only end up looking like a skeleton. What originally attracted me to the leangains approach would be that I would be able to lose a bit of fat whilst putting on some muscle. I think you're right about mobility now would be a good time to sort that out as it has been holding me back. Might get into yoga as my hand heals. Thanks for the advice!"
leangains,3bvnie,emailrob,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:52:31 2015 UTC,"Well you're not doing leangains in that case. You may be doing IF perhaps. If you're keeping up cardio that will help, but you run the risk of losing muscle just doing IF without any weight training."

You wont grow magic muscles by IF and CR. You'll loose weight. it's still good to be lean at bulk time when your hand is better. So stick figure or skinny fat, up to you."
leangains,3bvnie,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"If you like doing IF in general, then yes of course.  Do whatever you're able to do, otherwise you're going nowhere.  I wouldn't worry about getting skinny, progress is better than none.  You ain't gonna lose no 1:1.  The body sees a bunch of excess muscle as metabolically costly and will prefer to get rid of it if it's not seen as necessaryt.  Based on your stats though you probably have just north of what god gave you.  You may lose a negligible amount of muscle assuming a proper cut with a lot of HIIT.  Lost muscle is rebuilt a lot quicker than new muscle is built. You will lose strength-skill to a far greater degree because the neural adaptations are pretty transient, which means they come back quickly as well"

Coffee has always been a weird thing for me. On weekdays when I'm up at 6 and have a coffee before work during my fasting period, I'm fine. However on weekends when I sleep in and have coffee, occasionally I get hypoglycemia from it. I find if I drink more than 1 cup I am guaranteed to have symptoms.  I haven't figured this out myself, but the study you posted is very interesting. I know by my personal experience that coffee has 'something' in it that causes these symptoms to occur, not just caffeine. I occasionally start my day by guzzling a liter of coke zero (way more caffeine than a cup of coffee) and have never had symptoms."

I don't go over board because it always leads to me out of the gym.   Most definitely technique.   And I don't see how you're going to get ripped shoulders without ever doing OHP.   OHP will make the shoulder muscles grow but the amount of body fat you have depends on your nutrition.   I have been seeing weight and rep increases every work out with this routine so I suppose it can't be that bad right?   You shouldn't be asking will this work?

leangains,3bra3f,datboyrobd,3,Thu Jul 2 03:03:25 2015 UTC,"The window of opportunity  Q: Understanding that a caloric surplus is required for muscle building, is there a window post workout where nutrient partitioning is greater towards muscle building? I would think that the nutrient partitioning ""curve"" would ultimately swing back to muscle maintenance or fat gain in the absence of muscle stimulus, but the question is how long after that stimulus?  A: Have a pre-workout meal, train, go home and fix yourself a big meal. No need to count minutes or stress about this stuff. The 1-3 hours figure is for fasted-state training and not applicable to how most people go about their diet and training. The 'window of opportunity' for nutrient partitioning post workout is much longer than a mere 3 hours.*  And since this question usually comes up in this context, never train completely fasted. Have some BCAAs/whey beforehand.  *Protein synthesis peaks acutely 1-3 hours post-workout and it is advantageous to have amino acids circulating in your blood stream during this period. Studies show that participants ingesting protein during this time frame gain more muscle - but these studies are performed on completely fasted individuals. For someone ingesting protein through a pre-workout meal or other source of protein pre-workout, those amino acids would be used for protein synthesis (making it less essential to stress about the post-workout shake).  **Protein synthesis is elevated above baseline for at least 24-36 hours after weight training.   source: Leangains Q&A"

leangains,3bngwl,Dima1988,18,Tue Jun 30 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"I can't link the post but there was a guy who posted on /r/bodybuilding who did a clean bulk and looked better and better as the weeks went by. I think it was after like 7 weeks, he took pics each week and posted saying something along the lines of ""so sick of this clean bulk"". Had orange hair I think.   Edit: Got to my laptop and found it. Here's the link: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/31xu5z/7_week_clean_bulk_and_im_in_a_slump/   Notice how much better he looked after even just 2 weeks of clean bulking and then compare the difference between that and week 7. He looks even leaner because of the added muscle.   I've said this before and let's compare numbers, and prove that it's worth it.   Assuming ""clean bulk"" is 300 calories excess per day and ""normal bulk"" is 500 calories excess per day. Also assume approximately 200 calories are used per day to build muscle. Since the rule of thumb, in ideal situations, is 0.5lbs of muscle per week. That's ideal and we're not ideal so we'll say that we build 0.4lbs/week which is 200 calories per day. This is also assuming clean eating in both scenarios.   Ok so 3500 * 0.4 = 1400, divide by 7 and that's 200 calories per day of muscle added.   Now let's say you did a normal bulk, which is 1lb/week: 3500 - 1400 = 2100 calories stored as fat.   Compared to lean bulk, which is .6lb/week: 2100 - 1400 = 700 calories stores as fat.   So you gain the same muscle but anything excess is stored as fat. So on the lean bulk you store 700 calories per week compared to 2100 on a normal bulk. That's triple the amount of fat! After only 1 month on the normal bulk you'll put on about 2.5lbs of fat while on the clean bulk it would take nearly 3 months to gain that much. In those 3 months you also put on significant muscle so not only is it slower but it also won't show as much. Not to mention that a higher LBM would mean slightly more calories burned and over 3 months that may amount to an even small gain of excess fat. Either way, it's not just worth it, it's really really worth it."
leangains,3bngwl,simple_mech,3,Tue Jun 30 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"This was an awesome post, and your math really clarified a few things for me. I suppose people forget that you can only gain muscle at a certain rate, while basically all excess calories will be stored as fat.  Also, the most important thing here for me is that even though you're bulking and putting on a small amount of fat, doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to look like you're fat. Ironically, bulking slowly could actually make you look leaner, which makes total sense.  Thanks again for breaking it down for us newbies :)"

You might burn less some days and all of a sudden you're bulking? Then you burn more the next day and you're cutting? But you take an average and you're maintaining?   Point is, don't put a label on it. Eat a little bit more than you burn and you'll make progress."

I might have missed it, but i see nothing that indicates this was a bulk ie he gained weight over a period of time.

leangains,3bngwl,hiroshi-ma2,-2,Tue Jun 30 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed response.  I don't think that body works in math equations though. Especially counting 1 pound of muscle as 3500 calories.  I think it is important to create proper environment for you body to gain muscle. Assuming identical type of training, higher calorie intake might be better. But I might be wrong on that one.  Guy from the pictures really looks leaner with the progress. I will read his story. Thank you for that."
leangains,3bngwl,joeeeeee_,3,Tue Jun 30 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure, but most of the time when he posted his routine it was in KGs.  but i also very much doubt he's benching 500+ lbs for reps.    and you are right in that being extremely lean to begin with allows for more fuck ups or just a larger surplus (initially at least) with very little fat gain.  but this wont last forever.    i'd honestly take it slow.  if you want to stay clean, there really isn't any other way to go if you also want to keep fat gains to a minimum.  just keep lifting with high intensity, that's the only way you are going to get stronger which in turn means more muscle mass, aka bulk."
leangains,3bngwl,joeeeeee_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"I just didn't see any guy with serious lifts and decent muscle mass who managed to gain it slow while staying lean. Everyone talks about lean bulking but I never met anyone who actually did it (natty).  And correct me if I am wrong: with slow bulking you still eventually become chubby, but you are staying that way for a much longer period of time.   May be it is better to have larger surplus at the end of the day...  About the bench - it is 235 lbs = 105kg, you can get it by the context."
leangains,3bngwl,joeeeeee_,3,Tue Jun 30 17:25:24 2015 UTC,"i mean i'm not model of perfection as i didn't hold to the diet 100%, but i had some pretty decent success last summer and into this spring on my slow bulk.  i wouldn't say you eventually become chubby with slow bulking (if you are doing it correct), but you will definitely feel/look like that to yourself at some points.  i believe this is mostly just body dysmorphia kickin in again.  for me anyway, when i cut i eventually begin to look disgusting small and weak, and when i bulk i eventually begin to look fat and bloated.  but then i later look back to photos from that same time and i look fine.   if your surplus is low, and you are gaining at what your plan is set for, you should be good as long as the training is increasing/showing improvement.  you obviously will get to a chubby state if your surplus is larger than it should be, and/or you are slacking in the gym.   the trick to the slow bulk is to eat just enough to help your recovery from the training.  a lot of people look at this backwards and instead treat the bulk more like training to eat more food."
leangains,3bngwl,Narthax,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"Could you tell your bulking numbers: lifts, weights, calorie balance-surplus?  I feel you on body dysmorphia thing. My frame is small and even couple pounds of fat ruins (subjectively) my looks.  I am always working out good. Just don't want to experience walking around fat for a long time. 3 months of bulk I can tolerate though."
leangains,3bngwl,soci4ldrinkr,4,Tue Jun 30 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"its probably all in my post history, but off the top of my head i was at an estimated TDEE of about 2600kcals, and was bulking with +1750 weekly.  I split that surplus up on the 3 training days, with 150g protein and a 40:60 ratio for fat:carbs, and then on rest i was running maintenance with 150g protein and a 60:40 ratio fat:carbs.  you can work out the grams of those with math, i just can't remember them off the top of my head.  i am short (5'8"") and at that point about 150lbs so my numbers will look pretty weak but before bulk i had this:  S: 250x6  D: 285x3  B: 205x4  I kept this going pretty much until January.  then i switched back to a slow cut / recomp and i've been following that ever since.  TDEE is somewhere around 2200 currently and i'm getting around 1800kcals on rest, and 2200-2400 on training.  still have protein at 150g, and then i have my fat at 92g on rest, and 44 on training, carbs at 299 on training and 66 on rest.  current lifts:  S: 3252x5  D: 365x6  B: 235x4  Looking back over my log, my lifts were this right before i switched to the slow cut/recomp: S: 275x5 D: 315x5 B: 135x10 for 10 sets (was trying out GVT instead of RPT for bench at this time)   i can safely tell you that if you have calculated your TDEE correctly, and you are very spot on with weighing food and tracking and staying to the diet plan, you will not get chubby in just 3 months. i'd suggest giving it a shot, and then evaluate from there.  you will most likely want to keep bulking at that point, but if you feel too much fat increase just drop back to a slow cut for 8-12 weeks and you'll probably be exactly where you want."

leangains,3bngwl,simple_mech,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:25:02 2015 UTC,"You are looking good. Looks like you know what you doing.  Could you share your observations on bulking: what benefited you the most, what was counterproductive?  What you do if you accidently overeat while bulking? Only add some HIT sprinting or make a move to a quick diet fix for a while?"
leangains,3bngwl,simple_mech,2,Wed Jul 1 09:36:11 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I would say the main thing whilst bulking that was counter-productive was monitoring calories to a crazy degree to stick to the 200-400 calorie over maintenance on training days ""rule"". For me this was counter productive. I wasn't gaining any muscle in such a low daily surplus. I think on this sub people are often guilty of getting caught up with equations and maths to create the perfect surplus. What they tend to forget is that your body is not a machine, it has so many variables and adaptation mechanics that simply saying eat this much and no more is simply counter productive. You may well expend 500 calories working out for an hour and a half, or even more if it's boiling like today (UK here) which instantly put you in a deficit with such a meagre surplus.  My advice would to eat 500-700 over your maintenance to be on the safe side, if you're still hungry, eat more, your body is telling you it needs food to repair. Get your calories from healthy sources at least 80% of the time. Think sweet potatoes, chicken, oats etc. If you've been bulking dirty on bread and doughnuts etc before berating me that a calorie is a calorie, bulk clean for 2 months then you're allowed an opinion, i guarantee your fat gains will be little to zero with foods your body are designed to eat.  So for over-eating, I recently went away for a week with my girlfriend and her family which made it impossible to fast and I had a couple of days where I ate ice cream and a few things I normally wouldn't. I also couldn't measure calories accurately. I  put on a small amount of abdominal fat which i've managed to lose in the space of 3 days. The first day I did 20mins of HIT sprinting fasted, about 5-7 sprints 2-3 mins walking. The second day I deadlifted and squat as usual then today I've done another fasted sprint session. Before i would have cut for a week, but I find this much more preferable as I can go straight back into my clean bulk with no interruption."
leangains,3bngwl,datboyrobd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:15:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the practical info. I think you are right that the body doesn't work by math rules (at least by simple ones). And 80% whole foods idea makes sense.  I like your approach. Looks like something worst a try.  When you do your additional sprinting sessions after overeating have you noticed any influence on you recovery from regular lifts? And you don't touch your calorie intke a bit while doing that, correct?"
leangains,3bngwl,tontyboy,2,Wed Jul 1 11:22:59 2015 UTC,"No, in fact research has shown that HIT can aid recovery and activates the MTOR pathway for increased protein synthesis."

leangains,3bngwl,aesthetic-as-fuck,2,Wed Jul 1 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind it was high carbs/low fat. Minimal fat was stored, most carbs that didn't become glycogen or get burned for fuel probably got burned off as heat."
leangains,3bngwl,tontyboy,0,Tue Jun 30 17:36:19 2015 UTC,It is a good point.

There is no such thing as slow bulking or fast bulking.  If you are training hard enough, and getting enough rest, and eating enough then you will put muscle on.  If you eat too much you will put fat on.  Now, dieting is easy, so if you don't care then sure, eat as much as you fucking want, but it won't give you more muscle gain more quickly."

Do you see any of the great fitness/bodybuilding physiques out there training only 2 to 3 times per week? No. Generally a 5 day split is the minimum, with a 6-day PPL or Arnold split being the unanimous favorite for natural lifters working to improve their physique. And I'm not talking about guys on gear, there are plenty of clearly natural athletes with phenomenal physiques, and all of them train 5-6 days per week, sometimes all 7. And nutrition, that's not really an issue I have with the leangains crowd. Energy balance is everything. 6-hour eating window, 8-hours, 14... whatever. It's all the same as long as your calorie and macro breakdown are the same.   Basically, all I'm saying is, there is absolutely no way in hell training 2-3 times per week, as it seems is very common of leangans, is optimal for building a physique or gaining strength at the best rate possible."

Carbs could be an issue I guess, but if your last few days have been around normal intake, I don't know why they would be a problem.    Have you started creatine recently maybe?  Is your sodium level too high?  What kind of cardio do you do?"

leangains,3bqe4e,tecumseh_reborn,-2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:57 2015 UTC,It's probably not only the carbs but also fiber can cause constipation. You might want to play around with quantities until you find what works for you
leangains,3bmkih,ChickenWaffleGravy,2,Tue Jun 30 12:55:37 2015 UTC,"Martin Berkhan basically invented RPT as we know it. He says, ""The other 1-2 sets which are done with a lower weight, should be increased independently.""  I suppose if you're rocketing up your top set because of noob gains or regains, you can hold 90% +1 static until things get tough. In that case, it's good to get some feeling that you're getting something accomplished if your top set is a struggle.  And yes, 31M added his own twist here and there, including the +1 only bit, but clearly it's working for him. Honestly, it probably doesn't matter that much."
leangains,3bmkih,AndrewAMD,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for linking to that, reading now.   Edit: So, if I'm reading correctly, he suggests the first week following the 10%/+1 rule off your top set, but then independently increasing the subsequent sets as they get easier to do and progression occurs. Makes sense."

leangains,3bmkih,tontyboy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"I do one way and others do another.  Honestly now, what use is a consensus on this?  After a few months of operating at maximum it literally won't matter which one you pick.  But put simply, if your second set is at or very close to your top set then your top set isn't heavy enough.  So it's swings and roundabouts."
leangains,3bmkih,tontyboy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"I guess it's just one of those things that I'd rather have asked than constantly wonder if I'm not doing it optimally. At the end of the day it doesn't make much difference, but I like hearing other opinions.  I also wasn't sure if one method was more outdated than the other given the time disparity between answers I've seen, possibly being because one was proven ineffective/less effective."
leangains,3bmkih,soci4ldrinkr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:31:10 2015 UTC,"but the incorrect definition between fast and slow implies there's a time limit.  Whether you reach your goal in 12 months or 18 months really doesn't matter does it.  Way I see it, even if you are consistently sub optimal you're still gonna be better off than wasting time worrying over technicalities than don't matter.  In terms of time, I wouldn't worry about it.  If it worked for someone 100 years ago it would work now.  Thinking a technique or programme is superior due to its modernity alone is daft."
leangains,3bmkih,musclehacking,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"I found time after time, that following 31minutes' -10% 1 more rep, If I correctly fail my top set, then I can barely manage that +1th rep on the lower weight."
leangains,3bmkih,joeeeeee_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:37:12 2015 UTC,"method of progression (with 2 sets) where the 2nd set is ALWAYS 10% less and ALWAYS only +1 rep   This. If your top set is truly to failure, I've found quite consistently that my second set with ~-10% weight and +1 rep is one rep off of failure (with a solid 3-5 minute rest in between sets).   Even if you feel that you can do more than +1 rep (you should), limiting yourself to only one more rep on the second set is key to progression on the first set for next week.   Anecdotally, I've actually found that pushing myself beyond that +1 rep on the second set has stalled my first set the following week - especially while cutting.   The importance of recovery can not be overstated when reaching 'true' failure on your first set in RPT. +1 the second set, and stop there. If you progress it independently then it's likely to hamper your progress on your first set. A third set (possibly when bulking) would still follow the same -10% weight and +1 rep from the second set."
leangains,3bmkih,musclehacking,5,Tue Jun 30 13:29:13 2015 UTC,"i've noticed on the big lifts like squats and deads, that backoff set at 10% less for +1 is basically the max i could do after my top... but on Bench it doesn't seem to translate.  for instance, my chest day last week had a top set of 235lbs x 4, so my back off should have been 211.5 (we'll call it 210 for simplicity) x 5.  well i crushed those 5 reps clean and smooth, and still had a lot left in the tank, where as my top set i barely locked out that 4th and it was a struggle after the 2nd rep.  so maybe the best way to approach weekly progress on RPT is a mixture of the 2 schemes.  I don't see any issue with either so long as you keep progressing at some measurable statistic each week."
leangains,3bmkih,glabius,2,Tue Jun 30 16:18:43 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'll pay more attention to how difficult my second sets are in terms of one in the tank vs. two in the tank.    I don't see any issue with either so long as you keep progressing at some measurable statistic each week.   Can't argue with that.

It will give your body more shape even at higher body fat percentage and also raise your metabolism which makes cutting easier. There's not much to gain by stripping away fat to reveal mostly skin and bones. Maybe consider a recomp where you hit your weekly maintenance calories but on workout days you are at 500 cals over maintenance, and on rest days you end up respectively about 500 under. You'll have to do the math to make sure you end up about even on calories in vs out and overtime make sure that you are slowly getting heavier and seeing result in the mirror and pushing more weight. Barbell work with the main compounds lifts should be a good starting point to help you understand strength training and focus on your foundation for later brogress.

leangains,3bkxrf,heroyi,6,Tue Jun 30 13:28:20 2015 UTC,Fat loss is a slow process. You need to give it more time if you want to see big results. 3 months is enough for the world to see a difference though not a HUGE difference.   You have been at it steady for 3 true months now. Just keep up the pace and eventually you will see your result.
leangains,3bkxrf,simple_mech,6,Tue Jun 30 02:31:13 2015 UTC,Sleep and eat well and give it time. Now that the finish line is in sight you're trying to sprint to it but it doesn't work that way.   Btw walk for more than 20 minutes. I believe your body goes into its highest rate of fat oxidation after ~15-20 minutes of LISS cardio.

Symptoms:   long period of time spent losing weight  very low body weight achieved without aesthetic goals hit low muscle general frustration   I suffered the same issues. Your problem is NOT that you have excess belly fat - that will go away when you get to a low enough body fat %. The problem is that you would need to get down below 130 lbs to get to that level of leanness, and getting to such a low weight is not attainable without eating like a damn rabbit.  You need to bulk. Do it slowly, but take a full year. I'm serious. Bulk 1.5-2 lbs a month for a full year. At the end, if you've been lifting consistently, you'll have significantly more muscle, and then your cut afterwards will be significantly more successful. You're sacrificing leanness now to be able to attain it in the long run.  Good luck."

In general, there's no such thing as ""stubborn belly fat"". The lower abdomen is the last place that EVERYBODY loses fat. If you haven't lost it there, it's because you haven't cut enough. You're throwing around numbers like 10% and 12% as if you're sure, but if you still had noticeable belly fat, then you've never gotten to 10%.  Also, you said you've been doing this 6 months, but the ""first two or three"" months were incorrectly done. So really you've been doing LG (assuming you're actually doing it right now) for only 3 months? How much weight have you lost in that time? Also saw in a comment that you ""ate at a deficit until you got to 10%, but then started bulking out of frustration"". So in 3 months, you already did a cut, got frustrated, and started bulking? That doesn't add up to me AT ALL.  Truth is, it sounds like you need to cut, and start lifting a LOT harder. You're skinny as hell. If you still have body fat at your height and weight, it means you have very little muscle. Focus on that."

The fine-point precision of this aside, isn't 100-150kcal of protein a broken fast? I mean, I've had less calories for breakfast many times. I'm not saying it matters; most people roughly 'fast' between dinner and breakfast anyway, right, like 12 or so hours? The extra 4 wasn't going to do all that much on its own.

leangains,3bkxrf,lucky69,-1,Tue Jun 30 10:28:50 2015 UTC,Careful. 30g bcaa IS different than whey. A scoop of whey typically contains in the ballpark of 80-120kcal which will break fast.

There is some pretty solid info there that revolves around the use of yohimbine and HIIT training coupled with LISS cardio.

I did nothing special to get there, just standard protocol without any cardio or supplements (other than bcaa for fasted training). At that point I was circa 142lbs and 5'6 (currently 149lbs at around 8%). So two conclusions:  1) you can just continue as you are and when you strip off a few more pounds whilst retaining existing muscle mass you'll see that the fat has been stripped from lower abs.  2) at 12%, 5'10, 147lbs, the likelihood is that you have relatively little muscle mass. This lack of muscle makes a huge visual difference, and a very slow lean bulk would mean that at the same body fat you will leak visually leaner as your abs develop.  Do whichever you're most comfortable with, I started with a gut so cut all the way down to 5.5% (bod pod result) when I first started."

Anecdotal evidence: I went on a camping trip, and was thus eating strictly keto for 4 days. You can't cheat when you're out in nature either ;) so it was as strict as it gets.  We walked tens of miles per day, up mountains etc. and I carried very firewood in the evenings.. it was excruciating.  I managed to knock off 1 KG of fat in those 4 days... not muscle either. I know because I track my bf% carefully using my withings scale.  But here comes the kicker: I put it all back within 1 week, by overeating.  Normally I cycle a lot more than I do now that I'm on my plateau. I stopped cycling so much due to family issues, and that's what put me on the plateau.  So I'd advise much longer and harder physical activity if you want to tap into that fat. like going for 10 mile rides, or long runs daily. Those activities where your brain is telling you ""what the hell are you doing? And why is it taking so long. Please stop"".  If it's not hurting, you're probably not doing long and hard enough."

leangains,3bkxrf,acconrad,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:24:36 2015 UTC,Youre skinny fat. You need to put on muscle. No amount of dieting down will give you the results that you want. Stop losing weight.
leangains,3bkxrf,Baramin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Great job with developing and following a plan - discipline and perseverance is what it takes.   Judging by your pictures, you have very little muscle mass and I bet your lift numbers could use a huge boost. For you right now, you have nothing to show if you were to be shredded - and that's ok, but it means you're going to need to become a bad paperweight to look really lean. You need to focus on getting stronger and building muscle. Your body in its current state looks like it would do a recomp quite well and you will most likely utilize noob gainz.   Recomp for a bit, see where you're at, then decide to continue or cut from there."

I am in the same boat as you, and have stalled on my weight loss, but the vast majority of feedback here is that bulking significantly first will help with an asthetic cut later, which is the conclusion I was slowly coming to myself; now I'm convinced.

leangains,3bkxrf,Secondhand_Crack,0,Tue Jun 30 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get crushed for mentioning that in /r/leangains, but fasting can elevate cortisol, and belly fat is a sign of elevated cortisol...  Maybe you should put IF aside for a month or two and see if that helps.  Also, try to meditate ~5-10mn a day and diminish coffee if you're a big coffee drinker to help lower this hormone.  my 2cts..."

leangains,3bl5bj,ChickenWaffleGravy,5,Tue Jun 30 02:49:35 2015 UTC,"Are you eating thighs and drumsticks? That would explain why it's so high. Eat leaner meats and fish.   500g of chicken breast is 115g protein and about 6g of fat. Leaner fish includes things like mahi mahi, cod, etc. Also canned fish are pretty clutch.   Low fat or 0% fat cottage cheese and Greek yogurt are pretty good too. A little tub (4 servings) of cottage cheese is 320 calories, 54g protein, 8g fat, and I think like 18g carbs."

leangains,3bl5bj,CaffeineExperiment,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:14:03 2015 UTC,"1lb of chicken is 100g of protein and that's 450g so 500g is slightly higher hence the extra 15g. Are you taking the measurement with the skin? Maybe that's why you're getting 10g per 100g. I'm talking skinless here.  As a rule of thumb, most meats and fish are like that with slightly higher fats and lower protein. 1lb (450g) is usually 80-100g and the fat varies depending on how lean it is."

I have that maybe 5 or 6 days a week and I hit my weekly goals pretty spot on so I'm guessing it's not entirely inaccurate."
leangains,3bl5bj,nixx1338,3,Thu Jul 2 09:58:12 2015 UTC,You are obsessing about reducing the intake of an essential macronutrient. You don't need to have it extremely low if your caloric surplus doesn't exceed ~25% of your total TDEE.   Eat whatever you want as long as you are within your caloric restriction. Keep protein high enough so you aren't constantly hungry. <--- easily achieved if you stick to whole foods.

That's usually what I end up doing anyway. Just wondering if I was missing anything since I saw posts on reddit where guys are going off sub-50g of fat and I'm sitting here wondering how that's possible knowin what I know about macro counting and what foods contain what amount of nutrients.

leangains,3bl5bj,RG3HTTR,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"rump can be either top round, bottom round, or eye of round. I think they're all pretty similar. Have you tried doing it in bulk instead? I like to buy 10 lbs of top round and slow cook for 10 hours every Sunday. I use salt, fresh garlic, fresh onions, pepper, cumin, cayenne, beef broth and it comes out soooo good and fork tender. I just keep it in the fridge until I need to eat it."

leangains,3bimgm,Peckerdick,7,Mon Jun 29 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"If you stalled in reducing body fat percentage then you need to further reduce your caloric intake. Once you hit around 10% body fat, you can start bulking.   Now I don't know if you've read the 31minutes AMA but if you haven't, you definitely should - all of it. In there is the protocol to increasing your strength while cutting: reverse pyramid training.  Honestly, I'd rather start skinny so I could see the progress made and I'd feel better knowing that I could cut to 10% again later after a bulk once I've already done it. People have said that they rather do the opposite, and that's also fine.   Do what makes you think will keep you staying with the program longer as the choice you're happiest with is the one that will keep you motivated. Remember that Leangains is a set of guidelines meant to be adapted to your own life-style."

I should have mentioned this, but I am going on a beach trip in a couple months and want to look as good as I possibly can because there will be a lot of ladies there. I feel if I continue cutting without much muscle mass, I'm just going to look like a skinny dude.  I've decided to do a clean bulk at 300 calorie excess per day. I'm thinking that even with the small amount of fat gain, I am probably in a position to put on a lot of muscle right now, which is going to hopefully make me look even leaner, and give me more of that V look that I'm hoping to achieve.  Thanks for your really helpful feedback!"

leangains,3bimgm,t3nacity,2,Mon Jun 29 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"Reverse diet up and bulk. Bulking properly is hard, but cutting is easy. Reverse diet up for a few months so you can improve metabolic flexibility. Increase lifting intensity with your new energy surplus and you will continue making gainz in the gym. Then after a few months you can cut again because you already know how to do that. Read tonty's post on bulking the right way."
leangains,3bimgm,t3nacity,0,Mon Jun 29 17:17:17 2015 UTC,How much muscle mass could I expect to put on in two months of bulking? Do I have any additional benefit in muscle growth potential since it's the first bulk I've ever really done?
leangains,3bimgm,cforres,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:49 2015 UTC,"What is your training volume? How are you training in relation to your 1RM? What is your surplus? Will you be doing any cardio?  Basically, there is no exact answer to your question without more information. You need to track your weight and calories daily for a few weeks (I suggest MyFitnessPal). Then you can calculate your moving TDEE based on weight gain in relation to caloric intake per week. Once you know your true TDEE you can program your bulk surplus for your preferred gainz per week/month.  Start bulking and start tracking if you aren't already. Then you can go from there. You want more muscle so start training harder and eating more. Calculate your numbers and make changes where needed."

Cliff Notes   Rule of 7's - for every inch in height you can expect a +-7lbs of lbm added to weight At 5'10 there are 3 classes of lbm: 140 (easily attainable, relatively speaking), 155 (what most of us are trying to achieve), 166 (extreme outliers, anything above is most likely using steroids and getting here is very hard) How do you know if you're an outlier? If you were one, you would know by now   Here are some examples of the above at 10% body fat so you guys can compare, I will add each weight in the 140/155/166 lbm category:   5'8: 139/155/167 5'10: 154/171/183 6'0: 169/186/198 6'2: 185/201/213"

I've read Martin's article (http://www.leangains.com/2010/12/maximum-muscular-potential.html) and now rippedbody posted one.  Last week I came across FFMI for the first time (also mentioned in this article).  I think it's fun to play with these numbers and see how they can be applied to past BB champs to determine genetic potentials without steroids but it kind of stops there.  These types of formulas shouldn't be considered ""calculators"" that will give people exact numbers.  For reference, I'm 6' and weigh 192ish.  That puts my roughly 5 pounds away from my potential but I know damn sure even though its only 5 pounds, its actually multiple cut/bulk cycles to replace those 5 pounds of fat with muscle and isn't as easy as it seems.   EDIT: I realize I'm no where near 5%, thats why I was trying to say that to actually be that weight it'd be alot of time and hardwork that i probably honestly won't put in (my goal physique is closer to 10-12)."

leangains,3bj03v,simple_mech,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks! Edited!  I should add that I have a refeed day once a week at around 2400 calories with most/all of the extra calories coming from carbs. I workout 3 days a week and perform some type of cardio and ab workout 3 other days per week. Sunday I just rest and still consume my normal calories because my calories are already kind of low at around 1800 and also I have found that going lower calorie on ""rest days"" is hard for me and ends up just making me not want to rest and never getting a break.   Even though I have been making strength gains over the past 6 months it has also been somewhat frustrating because I want to cut all the way down on my first round. Ideally I would get my 6 pack as fast as possible and then go to maintenance followed by a slow lean bulk. It kind of stinks that my cut is taking so long because I am not being as efficient with my noob gains. It would be awesome if I could be in a slight calorie surplus and take advantage of the noob gains more efficiently. I just can't bring myself to bulk at all until I get my 6-pack showing."

The next 2-3 weeks will be very interesting for weight loss. I was at 12.5% BF in May when I weighed 180.4 (22.8lbs of fat according to DXA).  Problem is I had a binge weekend/cheat day that had my weight shoot up to 195 in May! That's right, gained 15lbs from 2 bad days of eating. Lost most of it in a couple of days. Got back down to 182 that week. Now I am trying to get down to 178 (according to the DXA I should be around 10%bf at that weight)."

This way you have a bit more food on workout days and still cut the same weight.   As far as your question, I didn't realize I've read that article before until about halfway through. It's actually one of the reasons I started eating a tub of cottage cheese before bed. IF and training fasted are already part of leangains. So to answer you, I wouldn't think too much about it but having some protein before bed couldn't hurt, preferably slow digesting. I wouldn't think too much into it though."

Personally, I've found that a couple LISS sessions thrown in 3-5x per week improves muscle recovery, mental cognition and general hunger. I usually hop on the rowing machine or do some incline walking for 30-45 minutes after lifting while watching TV. I have been doing this for several months and have noticed significant improvements in body composition despite being on a bulk. Of course YMMV."
leangains,3bi2nc,ehmbie,4,Mon Jun 29 12:41:03 2015 UTC,On rest days I have an hour to kill on my lunch break so I do some stretching/foam rolling followed by 30-45 minutes on the stair climber.

Which is really not hard to accomplish.  I took up running recently, and by running we're just talking like 75 minutes of walking with occasional one-minute hard runs.    Muscles heal quicker, body feels better, stairs are easier.  I'm also running more or less a training-day TDEE all 7 days now.  I think doing morning cardio only further adapts you for leanness/fueling activity with fat.  Think of everything you do as forcing adaptation and it becomes simpler."
leangains,3bi2nc,musclehacking,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"Not required, but in Martin's program he actually had LISS scheduled on rest days for many of the same reasons you just listed. I believe the ""don't do cardio"" school of thought came as kind of a necessary backlash to the ""HIIT 24/7 for optimal gains"" push.  Personally I go for a jog (moderate intensity, ~20 minutes) 1-2 times/week on rest days, depending on work & uni. I think the body composition changes you're observing could be partly placebo, but I do agree that cardio isn't evil - feels gewd man."

Can't remember the link from the other day but it was a good one summed up as follows -   You are nothing more than a bag of bones, tissue and fluid. When you weigh yourself, you are simply finding out how much the bag weighs at that exact time.  If you weigh before eating/after eating, before bed/after bed, before drinking water/after having a drink of water - at those exact times the bag will weigh different amounts.  But have you changed your body composition in that time?  No.  So stop worrying and track long term averages instead."

leangains,3bi2nc,nixx1338,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"Let's imagine I prefer less strain on the lower back and want to max out my deadlift by pulling sumo. This would most likely require a certain amount of deloading as one does not simply go from A to B. In the spirit of RPT, always lifting heavy and never deloading on cut: could swapping your deadlift style have any overly negative impact? Would waiting till the end of the cut make any sense?"
leangains,3bi2nc,bms88,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"When you switch to sumo just work up to a set and lift it for as many reps as possible (basically just using maximal intensity).  This might be 5 reps or it could be upwards of 10, but what it'll do is give you a starting point to work with for the next training session.  This article touches a bit on how to progress with RPT: Reverse Pyramid Revisited"
leangains,3bi2nc,blacksun_redux,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"I have a similar question as QShin, but a little different.   I'm a beginner. I like to do cardio at the gym before working out. Moderate to high intensity for 25-30 minutes. I feel like it warms my body up and gets me in the right state of mind for working out.   Am I hurting or helping my weights workout by doing this cardio beforehand? Should I do less? Should I do cardio after working out? Or not at all, save for rest days?"
leangains,3bi2nc,simple_mech,2,Mon Jun 29 21:36:35 2015 UTC,You can walk or do light/moderate cardio but doing moderate/intense cardio is going to hurt your weightlifting.
leangains,3bi2nc,glabius,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"high intensity is going to affect your lifts because it can deplete glycogen that needs to be used for maximal power output.  cardio is better reserved for rest days (good thing to keep mind off food) or for after your workout.  Light cardio isn't like not reccommended before you lift, if you feel it helps you warm up better you should do it"

leangains,3bi2nc,MrSquat,4,Tue Jun 30 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it might over-accelerate your recovery and increase your strength levels faster than you are mentally prepared for. Try half-assing your workouts to compensate.  [In other words no, it's not bad. Feel free to enjoy the sauna]"
leangains,3bi2nc,GonGoon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:12:06 2015 UTC,Is it bad to eat all of my calories pre-workout?
leangains,3bi2nc,MrSquat,2,Tue Jun 30 07:28:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, very bad."
leangains,3bi2nc,GonGoon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:12:20 2015 UTC,Why is that? Do you have any articles that I can read?
leangains,3bi2nc,MrSquat,2,Tue Jun 30 09:29:50 2015 UTC,"Why is that?   The biggest reason would be that you shorten your post-workout anabolic phase. The time spent in ""fed mode"" ie the anabolic state is highly dependent on the digestion time. From the moment you eat your last meal you have about 4-10h depending on what you were eating where you are ""fed"", after which physiological ""fasting"" begins (physiological fasting lags way behind the time you actually stop eating). Having the largest part of the daily calories post-workout maximizes the anabolic phase.  So to clarify with an example, let's say whatever you eat results in 8h of digestion time after you stop eating and you train 2h after your largest meal because otherwise you're bloated and can't really perform.  So in the pre-workout calories example you spend 6h post-workout being ""fed"", while in the post-workout calories example you spend 8-10h (depending on how long it takes you to cook and eat).    Do you have any articles that I can read?   Just go ahead and google if you want articles, no need to have me do that for you."
leangains,3bi2nc,brigboy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:40:50 2015 UTC,"Of the two situations, which one's worse? 1) Drinking a casual beer say 4-6 times a week (think more as a compliment to food)? Or just drinking more liberal amounts (6-10 beers) two nights of the week (going out two nights of the week)?  I know alcohol takes priority over fat loss oxidization (I'm not sure how pronounced the effects are as there are heavy drinkers that are still ripped) but beer is so tasty and satisfying with salty foods. Would you view beer with the IIFYM methodology? Would you do hard liquor as a compromise?  Edit: Is it better to have your alcohol on rest days or work out days? The logic for either makes sense. On rest days: alcohol does not compete with macro nutrients for body repair and growth. On work out days: it is easier to factor in the calories."

leangains,3bi2nc,simple_mech,3,Mon Jun 29 12:51:01 2015 UTC,Casual beer 4-6 times a week means 4-6 beers while liberal drinking 6-10 beer twice a week means 12-20 beers. Which is better? Neither honestly but I'm sure you can come to your own conclusion from the above.

Either A/B split or lower the number of sets and push yourself harder on the reps plus take a longer break between sets.

leangains,3bi2nc,simple_mech,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:01:18 2015 UTC,If recovery is starting to hinder progress then yes you should cut down volume. RPT is a great way to do that.

Shit is starting to get heavy, especially doing these lifts 3 times a week on a cut.   First of all, props for lifting the big 3, 3 times a week. Since you are getting to a point where the lifts are getting heavy, it's time to undulate the reps, reduce the frequency of heavy days, but still continue hitting the lifts 3xweek.  Example:  Mon   heavy squats 3x5   Tues   light(er) squats with more volume 4x8-10   Fri   either heavy squats 3x5 or technical work, same weight as in 3x5 but for less reps: 6x2 @monday weight   Choose your rep scheme depending on how you feel/how recovered you are. You'll know what you can do as soon as you warm-up. Make sure you are hitting more volume (volume = work weight x reps x sets [don't include warm ups]) than you hit last week and you will progress optimally.    Should I split down to an RPT split   Don't make drastic changes to your routine."

leangains,3bi2nc,hiroshi-ma2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:53:11 2015 UTC,This is why I don't like the term light. People usually misjudge it for a weight that they can half-ass their workout with. Light as in comparison to your 1RM. It should still be a weight that you can get for 8-10 reps with 2-3 in the tank. The last set should feel like you have 1 in the tank. Work your ass off but don't grind each rep of each set.   Also I track my volume in a spreadsheet and it's been on a steady decline as well   You can expect a decline in strength in the next 3-4 weeks if the trend continues.

I'm not a medical doctor, but bright blood in the stool usually indicates bleeding lower down in the tract which can be as simple as haemorrhoids or a small cut and not of concern (dark blood indicates it had been digested, comes from higher up, and can indicate significant problems). Go see a GP. They will probably tell you it's nothing. If it's not nothing then the last thing you want is for it to get worse because you were too embarrassed to ask for help.

leangains,3bi2nc,ericrobert,2,Mon Jun 29 20:27:17 2015 UTC,The main goal from an intermittent fasting diet like leangains is to moderate your calories easier because it's in only 1-2 meals as apposed to 6. This makes it easier to count calories and macros.  There have been studies that say the fasting is also very healthy but from what I gather from hanging out here that's not the main focus.

When he does make citations his conclusions go far further than what the study actually showed.  Such as improved insulin sensitivity may be a good reason for a person to do intermittent fasting but those benefits are shown independent of doing exercise combined with intermittent fasting.   Exercise, especially intense exercise that uses a lot of muscles (think compound movements like deadlifts and squats) causes a big surge in testosterone—which is why it can make good sense to combine exercise and fasting. Many studies have found that training in a fasted state is a terrific way to build lean mass and boost insulin sensitivity, not just because of the nifty hormonal responses, but also because it makes the body absorb the post-workout meal more efficiently.   No citations, claims that exercise causes a huge surge in testosterone release which combined with fasting will cause muscle gain. Even though studies do show hormonal response in regards to squats for example I don't think any studies show those hormonal changes are what causes hypertrophy or that combined with IF there is more hypertrophy etc."

I'm quite aware that muscle gain will be hindered, but the decrease in mental performance after 10 days or so of conventional cutting, is too expensive for me, even though by all measures I'm doing it almost perfect, including proper 3 day refeeds every 2 weeks (bodyfat is around 19% right now, yeah, I really let myself go for a couple of months)."
leangains,3bf2ci,pilord,2,Mon Jun 29 01:29:21 2015 UTC,"That's not quite a lean gains cut though, is it? if you cut using lean gains, I think you cut on rest days and eat at maintenance for workout days (so cut 20% every other day, roughly 0.5 - 1 lb per week). It's a slower cut but you don't seem to really lose strength or get a mental fog, at least in the experience of myself and others."

However, the mental fog might be smaller than usual."

I have done a leangains cut before, and while I don't remember if it affected my mental performance, I do remember two things: I rarely got hungry (which is a good thing, one that I believed then that was essential but it really isn't), and that it took more planning (and therefore time) than a traditional cut. If the main advantage of a leangains cut over a traditional one really is just down to making dieting easier, I can diet just fine on a traditional cut.  I did mention to another poster, who said his mental state was fine during cuts, that I'd try a leangains cut to see how it affects my mind. Usually the brain fog gets noticeable after 10 days or so, so I'm going to give it a 3 week try starting tomorrow. If by 3 week I notice there's less brain fog than what I get from 10 days on a traditional cut (which gets better because I do 3 day refeeds every 2 weeks), then I'll stick to leangains for cuts, otherwise I'll go with the simpler and equally effective (for me) method."
leangains,3bf2ci,simple_mech,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:24:42 2015 UTC,"to each their own i guess. What would be the differences between your current cut and a leangains cut, which make it more time-consuming?"
leangains,3bf2ci,simple_mech,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:50:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not doing calorie or macro counting; I'm just eating according to hunger, and tracking my weight progress weekly, if it's less or more than expected over 2 weeks, I readjust. I do make sure I eat enough protein (while I don't count, I have a rough estimate of how much I need, and make sure to get over that estimate daily), eat some fat, and fill the rest with carbs. It might seem careless, but it's been working perfectly for me. I do sometimes eat more or less than what I should (maybe I eat an extra piece of chocolate if I get cravings, or I don't eat as much as I should during dinner because it's late) but the changes are not big and usually even themselves out, as when I eat a bit more I get less hungry the next day, and if I eat too little I get hungrier. I know this method wouldn't work with everyone (my brother for example, could remain an entire day without getting hungry, and even then can easily forget about it, yet he's leaner than me), but it works for me.  I don't do carb cycling, so I can eat the same thing every day. I do 3 day refeeds every 2 weeks though, where I lower my fat intake to the minimum and replace those calories with carbs, and eat at maintenance.  I don't workout 3 times per week. TBH I'm not sure how much of a difference it would be, but I do force myself to hit everything at least once per week, and my lifts haven't gone down; then again, I am at around 19% bf.  I don't do IF, but this it not really a bother. I'm really not doing it out of lazyness more than anything."

leangains,3bf2ci,tontyboy,6,Sun Jun 28 17:45:08 2015 UTC,That's because they ate too much. How much fat you gain is going to be directly linked to how much you eat. If you want to gain nearly no fat then your weekly surplus should be minimal.

After the 12 hr mark I stay clear as a bell. Maybe even a tad sharper. Even if I smoke some weed or alter my state or something. After 24 hrs of liquid only is when I may get a little light headed or tired. So I stopped trying to stack fasts and do the straight 16 hr. But fasting 16-19 hrs is good for your brain. Not all people find it doable. All bodies are different. Martin's site has great lit on the mental portion of fasting. (it's good news) You should be A-OK."

I guess there's no better time test it than right now since I already have to cut anyway (or just to get over with it), even if I'm tired of experimenting (despite the negative side-effects, my cut is going perfectly) but hey, it kinda seems that what I want is the biggest selling point of bulking on leangains so that's good news.  EDIT: so IF (in specific, carb cycling doesn't do much) helps a tad, after the huge meals for about 2 hours, and after I've been fasting for a couple of hours. However, between meals and at the beginning of the fast it's the same. Still, it's better than before.  EDIT 2: contrary to what I initially believed, the mental benefits of IF have slowly been increasing more than I thought, even if it's still not nearly close to when I'm bulking. It's funny how the biggest increases come after getting hunger pangs... probably due to hormonal rebalance."

I'm not expecting to gain zero mass, but I'd accept to have a cutting phase once per year if it's short.  I couldn't find references to martin though.

leangains,3bea7j,avantar112,8,Sun Jun 28 12:22:16 2015 UTC,You could just take whey protein instead of BCAA prior to training.  Timing isn't a huge deal I don't think. Do what best fits your lifestyle. Obviously not 8 hours later but within a couple of hours is fine.
leangains,3bea7j,g0ldfinga,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:48:25 2015 UTC,Any idea what a good short term food would be instead of whey ?
leangains,3bea7j,g0ldfinga,3,Sun Jun 28 13:17:26 2015 UTC,Honestly per calorie eggs are probably your best choice.  Especially egg whites.  I buy egg whites in the carton and drink it raw sometimes. Just have to be careful not to consume to much raw egg whites because It can deplete some B vitamins I believe. Also I've heard raw egg whites aren't as an effective protein source than cooked egg whites.   Dairy is a good source of BCAA also.  Along with red meat.   Any reason why you don't want to just take BCAA or whey protein?

leangains,3bea7j,atomey,2,Mon Jun 29 19:15:00 2015 UTC,I mean if you eat before training you're not really training in a fasted state.  Buy some BCAA cheap on Amazon. Put 10g in water and chug it.

leangains,3baqo6,arnaouti,10,Sat Jun 27 12:11:32 2015 UTC,"Ramadan Mubarak, bro. You're absolutely correct.   It's always energy in vs. energy out, or the calories you consume vs what you burn. So long as you're calculating how much you're eating (I recommend myfitnesspal) you'll be fine. Just know how much your TDEE is and eat less than that.   If you're south asian, foods are filled with ridiculously fatty/fried foods (pakoras, samosas, dosas, etc). Sure you can eat that, but focus on eating more protein-dense foods. People tend to have a very limited view of how much they're ACTUALLY eating. A typical iftar of those fried foods can easily end up being 1500+ calories...and then there's a possible dinner and Seheri before starting the fast.   Figure out your TDEE, and count calories!   Also, read 31minutes' workout routine on the sidebar. It's very helpful. Good luck.   Edit: changed to 31minutes from 21minutes lol!"

I eat a very very small amount of the ""unhealthy stuff"" (a few pieces) and I immediately start having my BCAAs in a 20 fl oz bottle. I pray, I go to the gym with that. I stay there for about an hour and a half (ish). When I come home, I keep it as clean as possible with dinner. Meat (heavy) + vegetables (mostly for the fiber than anything) + brown rice (minimizing as much as I can). At this point I am pretty full and I start passing out, but I try to squeeze in as much water as I can throughout. I do not wake up to eat in the morning.   TLDR: Avoid unhealthy food at all cost... resist the urge to eat like a madman instead focus on water and a very macro optimized/heavy dinner. Also, I am on a cut.. taking advantage of Ramadan.

So it's not something that's impossible for our bodies to do which is why I don't understand why people debate it heavily. I could understand if it was almost never observed but it is noticeable in almost anyone who starts lifting, sometimes they don't have to even eat at a deficit. So it's something that our bodies CAN do, albeit as a beginner, but I believe it can also do it anytime the conditions are right (leangains)."

The thing to focus on though is less about ""can you build muscle in a deficit"", it's more about making the cut actually effective and quick, so you actually do get lean in 3 months.  Otherwise you end up ""cutting"" for 1-2 years and in that scenario you start wondering if you're getting anything at all accomplished."

You have visible abs currently, you are definitely in the ""lean""  region, so don't worry about that.   In general you shouldn't cut for longer than 3 months. And you shouldn't need to.

leangains,3b6ncm,demanufactureff,2,Fri Jun 26 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"I can't tell whether you're doing high bar or low bar. It looks like the bar is being held between by your wrists which will eventually cause injury. Either place the bar on your upper traps or on the mid deltoid shelf. You dont need to hold onto the bar with your hand, it can just be held in place with your palms to relieve force on your wrist.  The bar path is also too far back. The bar should be following a straight line above mid-foot. The back angle should correspond to what type of squat you're doing.

leangains,3b6ncm,joeeeeee_,2,Fri Jun 26 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"everything looked fine with that, but no weight on the bar may be what's causing you to feel off about it.  even when i do a bar only warm up... my balance is kinda off until i get some weight back on there and it feels more normal.  another thing, those shoes have got to be the worst for squatting.  the heel part looks like its a mini trampoline / air cushion.  kick the shoes off before your next set and see how much better your squat feels with a flat and solid foundation on your heels"
leangains,3b6ncm,ehmbie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:43:16 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention the shoes, I picked up a pair of chucks yesterday and used them for the first time today. MUCH better, I know what you mean about a solid foundation. They look better too, just a bonus perk.  I did 95lbs, 115lbs and 125lbs today. I really focused on keep the spine extended. I am not able to get quite as low but I felt a lot tighter during the lift, I think I'm getting there. I was sweating after three sets, usually I don't sweat at all on squats, a good sign I guess."
leangains,3b6ncm,joeeeeee_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"yeah i used to work out in chucks but then i got lazy and it is just quicker to throw a crap pair of running shoes on and slip them off for squats and deads.  but my gym is decently cool with us using chalk (well at leas they haven't yelled at me in a looooong time) and i'm constantly walking around in my socks and no one cares.  not all gyms are ok with this so YMMV.  not sure what you mean by focused on keeping the spine extended.  do you mean keeping it solid/neutral instead of it bending in like with butt wink?    a couple cues that really helped me in squatting was A) keep a proud chest B) when gripping the bar, almost envision you are ripping it down and out, like you are attempting to bend it over your shoulders and down your sides.    that last cue helps me keep my core solid through the grinding part of the later reps."
leangains,3b6ncm,ehmbie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I mean I'm trying to keep my back from rounding at the bottom. My main focus today was butt out + chest up. I'll try the bending the bar cue on Monday when I get back in there."
leangains,3b6ncm,joeeeeee_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"gotcha.  the chest up cue should be enough to keep your back in a good position, but the butt wink issue when getting low is most likely due to flexibility.  i know mine was bad too when i first started out, so i wish i could offer more advice but i honestly didn't do anything for it.  just corrected itself out the more i squatted.  i think the biggest thing for me was i'd record every top set, and sometimes a few warm ups and back off sets and just review during my rest.  it helps you make small tweaks during the workout rather than coming back home after and analyzing and trying to remember for next time."

leangains,3b85ey,fitnessguy1111,2,Sat Jun 27 13:22:50 2015 UTC,Damn. If only there was a detailed guide on alcohol and leangains.
leangains,3b85ey,wangston_huge,3,Fri Jun 26 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"Haha.  Lets help the guy out. Here's what Martin Berkhan (the OG triple OG of leangains) says:   The rules are as follows:   For this day, restrict your intake of dietary fat to 0.3 g/kg body weight (or as close to this figure as possible). Limit carbs to 1.5 g/kg body weight. Get all carbs from veggies and the tag-along carbs in some protein sources. You'll also want to limit carbohydrate-rich alcohol sources such as drinks made with fruit juices and beer. A 33 cl/12 fl oz of beer contains about 12 g carbs, while a regular Cosmopolitan is about 13 g. Good choices of alcohol include dry wines which are very low carb, clocking in at about 0.5-1 g per glass (4 fl oz/115ml). Sweet wines are much higher at 4-6 g per glass. Cognac, gin, rum, scotch, tequila, vodka and whiskey are all basically zero carbs. Dry wines and spirits is what you should be drinking, ideally. Take them straight or mixed with diet soda. (No need to be super-neurotic about this stuff. Drinks should be enjoyed after all. Just be aware that there are better and worse choices out there). Eat as much protein as you want. Yes, that's right. Ad libitum. Due to the limit on dietary fat, you need to get your protein from lean sources. Protein sources such as low fat cottage cheese, protein powder, chicken, turkey, tuna, pork and egg whites are good sources of protein this day. For effective fat loss, this should be limited to one evening per week. Apply the protocol and you will lose fat on a weekly basis as long as your diet is on point for the rest of the week."

Most of the good results are based in just not eating for timed intervals whether it be every day, every other day, or any other calculated formula. That and making sure when you do eat you eat all of what your body needs. Good to see more info and hopefully FDA looks but I am not holding my lobbying breath for it to be backed."

leangains,3b3jl2,TTPrograms,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:50:24 2015 UTC,"I can back you up on this one.   Here's a qoute from Martin Berkhan on the subject:   One way of measuring this is via the respiratory quotient (RQ). An RQ of 1.0 denotes pure carbohydrate metabolism (""storage mode""), while 0.7 denotes pure fat metabolism. To put this into perspective, consider that RQ is 0.95-1.0 for about 1.5-2 hours after a meal, 0.82-0.85 after overnight fasting and 0.72-0.8 after 16 hours of fasting. As the hours go by and the nutrients from the meal are done being absorbed, RQ drops in conjunction with insulin. There's a shift towards fat burning and mobilization of stored fat.   EDIT: realized that you're likely talking about the effect of a ketogenic diet on aging moreso than ketosis being caused by fasting. If that's the case, I'm pretty curious about the paper you're referencing as well."

You are a novice, you should probably read the FAQ at /r/fitness as a good basic foundation of knowledge.  You probably want to adopt an eating pattern that you can maintain in the long run that will allow you to be in an energy deficit.  For me  carb restriction works well.  You will also want to do a basic lifting program.  You don't need to get all caught up in minutia at this point.  Just watch what you eat, pick a basic lifting program and get to work.

leangains,3b2rfu,abdada,2,Thu Jun 25 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna help you out since everyone else is just saying read the sidebar.  According to my lean body mass calculator you only have around 132lbs of muscle on your frame. This means if you want abs, you have to get down to 10-12% body fat. Which would mean 145lbs, not 160. Either your numbers are off or you're morbidly obese for your frame. 180-132 is around 40% body fat.  Now since we know your lean body mass, we need to figure out your TDEE (maintenance calories). I did a TDEE calculator online and guessed and told it 40% body fat. The calculator spit out that your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) is 2453. This means this is your maintenance calories. This is what you eat in order to maintain your weight. In order to lose weight (about a pound a week) you need to subtract 500 from that number which comes out to 1953.   1g per lbm = 132g protein .5 per lbm = 66g fat Rest = 208g Carbs   so once again:   1953 calories every day 132g protein 66g fat 208g carbs   You can log this for free online using myfitnesspal.com or myfitnesspal app. I would guess it would take you around 10 months to lose the weight. Don't do anything dumb and just lift weights and lose weight and not try to rush it.  The best way to do a deficit is to do it food wise. It goes like this Diet>Weight Training>Cardio in that order. It's almost impossible to count how many calories you will lose in lifting weights and cardio. You can only make guesses and monitor weight loss per week and adjust. That's why I suggest just doing it through diet.  Since you are not really lean yet, I wouldn't suggest you doing leangains. It's more effect for sub 20%. As for a weight training program you can start out with Stronglifts and then transition to an upper/lower split after wards or do an upper/lower now if you don't care about strength and just want to look good."

The weekly number is what matters, so calculate that out first and then divide it up to your preference.  2) i've been following IIFYM for over 2 years now without any regard to the source of the macros, so anecdotally it doesn't make a bit of difference."

Even then, protein intake will be adequate if the person simply focuses on eating a variety of plant foods including grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruits and eats a sufficient number of calories throughout the course of the day.

Some people have really good insulin sensitivity and high levels of glycolytic enzymes that help clear carbohydrates efficiently.  Insulin sensitivity correlates strongly with leanness, though there are lean people with poor insulin sensitivity and husky people with fairly good insulin sensitivity so it isn't a hard and fast rule.   As for glycolytic enzymes, this has to do with how active you are, particularly how much high intensity exercise you engage in.  People who have poor carb tolerance will tend to suffer systemic inflammation from elevated blood glucose in response to carbohydrate feeding.  This actually causes a nasty feedback loop as inflammation causes insulin resistance, which further reduces carb tolerance."

You say that you clearly have more weight to lose but what you probably mean is your LBM dropped just as much as your body weight did so you're not satisfied with how you look.

This includes diet, lifting, and recovery.  Even if you only create a plan for one day a week, follow it religiously.  If it's three days a week, follow it religiously.  That is consistency.  Without it, how do you expect to gauge your progress week to week if you have inconsistent results to compare it with.  I seriously suggest you read the fuckarounditis article daily, until it sinks in.   That's the kind of mind set you have to have.  It applies to life not just leangains."

leangains,3b03r0,joeeeeee_,2,Thu Jun 25 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"what are your current lifts?  you look like you might have some muscle behind the fat, but you are easily 25%.  if that's close to accurate, your LBM around 157 and your height suggests you are at least at novice training levels and higher.  if you managed to maintain 100% LBM and cut to 178lbs, you'd be at 12% (again assuming my estimation is correct, its probably not).  your lower chest will be one of the last places you see the fat drop from (along with lower abs) so you don't get discouraged if you are nearing the end of the cut and it still doesn't look perfect."

Ill do my squat and deadlift soon, but they arnt gonna be too helpful as i do have a leg condition that keeps me from doing the best i can do on that type of leg exercises and stuff, not saying i dont try im just saying its hard, i still work on it though, but the numbers for that arnt gonna make sense."

leangains,3ayuwp,madsundevil,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:44:59 2015 UTC,This. Consider the exercise cals as bonus. Figure out your non-exercise TDE and thats your food calorie budget.
leangains,3ayuwp,BlackOpz,11,Thu Jun 25 01:19:10 2015 UTC,"Just ask yourself these questions:  1) are you morbidly obese to the point that walking even a short distance will get you absolutely winded?  2) did you walk for like 7 hours?  if your answer to either question is no, then there is no way you burned 1000kcals walking.  FitBit/MFP or whatever estimator you use is highly inaccurate.   easiest advice i can offer is to run a search at the top of this page for ""TDEE"" and read up on that method.  you will never have to worry about your exercise calories burned ever again."

leangains,3ayuwp,DH51,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:59:45 2015 UTC,"For fun, let's assume those 44k+ steps (non running steps only) were the average human stride of 2.6 ft each (2000 steps per mile).  That's just around 22 miles, and assuming a walking speed of 3MPH that's over 7 hours of walking.  So this validates point 2.   But still no where near as many kcals burned as the app claims."
leangains,3ayuwp,joeeeeee_,2,Thu Jun 25 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"I also believe that calorie counting gizmos also include your rest state calorie consumption (very roughly 100 kcal/h). Correct me if I'm wrong. So if your gadget says you consumed 1000 kcal and walked for 7 hours, you have increased your calorie consumption only by 1000 kcal - 7 h * 100 kcal/h = 300 kcal."
leangains,3ayuwp,zorbasz,2,Thu Jun 25 09:11:47 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then this is double dipping.  you're suggesting that the 2473kcals burned includes BMR, but BMR is already factored into MFP diet plan.  so if OP or anyone syncs their FitBit to MFP, and then proceeds to eat back exercise kcals that were subtracted by the syncing, they would have accounted for BMR twice and thus ruin any chance at a deficit most likely.  the take away being, don't trust any of those estimators and never eat back the exercise kcals.  just follow the TDEE method outlined numerous times in this and many other fitness subs and never stress about it again."
leangains,3ayuwp,joeeeeee_,5,Thu Jun 25 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"Fitbit also has a metric for total calories burned. I wouldn't trust it, however. According to Fitbit I usually have a daily caloric deficit of at least 1500 calories but I'm still only losing around a half a pound a week. It isn't accurate."
leangains,3ayuwp,gadiantonlobber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:09:51 2015 UTC,A deficit of 1500? What is your daily intake and how many calories does it say you burn? Mine is very accurate.
leangains,3ayuwp,dwightshoulders,2,Wed Jun 24 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"Yesterday for example: I ate ~2200 calories. Fitbit says I burned 4400 calories from 37 minutes at the gym and 18,000 steps."
leangains,3ayuwp,gadiantonlobber,3,Wed Jun 24 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"Then you're doing something /have thing setup wrong. If I get 18k steps and do a regular gym session, Fitbit says I've burned 800 kcal.   Which is much more reasonable."
leangains,3ayuwp,Cobra_McJingleballs,2,Thu Jun 25 01:16:57 2015 UTC,So I think we're talking about different things. I'm talking about total calorie burn for the day and I think you're talking about calories burned solely from those 2 activities. Mine is a TDEE estimate.
leangains,3ayuwp,gadiantonlobber,-4,Thu Jun 25 01:24:48 2015 UTC,"4,400 cals! Wow. How far did you run? Are you a long distance runner or do you do a lot of cardio?  If so, I think what you are experiencing is called metabolic adaptation. Basically, you body adapts to the energy demands you put on it over time. If you often tell it to run 6+ miles (arbitrary number), your body will adapt to burn energy more efficiently. And by more efficiently, I mean it burns less calories to perform the same work.  So, my guess is that your fitbit thinks you are burning 4,400 calories based on your heartbeat and whatever other data it uses, but your body's metabolism is conditioned to burn far less than that.  What do you think?"
leangains,3ayuwp,dwightshoulders,5,Wed Jun 24 20:05:21 2015 UTC,I didn't run at all aside from the quarter mile to and from the gym. I just walk a lot and it seems to think I'm really active for some reason. I doubt I'm really burning any more than 2500 calories a day.
leangains,3ayuwp,gadiantonlobber,3,Wed Jun 24 21:11:59 2015 UTC,I doubt I'm really burning any more than 2500 calories a day   you're not.  those fitbits/MFP calculations are based on bullshit.  i almost think they purposefully inflate those numbers to help keep some idiots motivated to continue exercising... but then they really just use it as an excuse to binge by that many more calories.
leangains,3ayuwp,joeeeeee_,2,Wed Jun 24 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, this."
leangains,3ayuwp,karlmarxiskool,-2,Thu Jun 25 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"sounds like you're on the right track. as you become more fit your body does burn less to perform the same activity.  your heart, muscles, and other systems, become stronger, more efficient.  You also, generally, lose weight, (assuming you were fat and unfit before...of course it's possible to be fit and overweight, but that's not the point) which means it's easier to move your mass around.  less work to do same job means less calories needed."
leangains,3ayuwp,DawnoftheShred,3,Wed Jun 24 21:12:09 2015 UTC,Just curious what job do you have? It's quite hard to burn 1kcal from walking unless you have some crazy on-your-feet job.
leangains,3ayuwp,Volt52121,2,Wed Jun 24 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"I believe it, bar tending standing up and pacing for 8+ hrs a night has got to burn something significant off, right?"
leangains,3ayuwp,EnduroRacer,3,Wed Jun 24 19:36:12 2015 UTC,Probably less than you would think.
leangains,3ayuwp,Doesnt_speak_russian,3,Thu Jun 25 00:39:37 2015 UTC,Is that from steps all day? If it is and you said lifestyle was 'active' then you are double counting calories. Those steps are already factored in your tdee.
leangains,3ayuwp,broscientologist,4,Wed Jun 24 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"How did you come up with a goal of 3,075 calories? And what is your goal? Are you trying to eat at a surplus? How big of a surplus?  If you used a TDEE calculator, then you already have calories burned from exercise built into the calories. You don't need to double count calories burned."
leangains,3ayuwp,dwightshoulders,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"If you want to do that, you'd be adding 1000 cals to your base metabolic rate and not your total daily energy expenditure.  You probably aren't walking 1000 calories a day though."

leangains,3ayuwp,nilestyle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"Unless you're a giant, or trying to do a serious bulk, you don't need more than 3k calories a day. I'm 6'5"", very active, and my TDEE is about 2700/day. You're on a track to gain serious weight."

leangains,3ayuwp,tcoop2232,-2,Wed Jun 24 16:49:55 2015 UTC,Myfitnesspal has a concept of net calories where it gives you a number of cals to hit on diet alone (assuming no exercise) that already factors in a cut. If based on your weight / height it told you to eat 3000 and you burn 1000 with exercise you can add that 1000 to your food and still be at deficit.
leangains,3axzfz,elasticjaw,5,Wed Jun 24 12:05:55 2015 UTC,I estimate 23% bodyfat. Your ideal weight is 145lbs. Based on your current diet you will reach you ideal weight on December 2nd.  I hope this helps.

leangains,3aykpx,pretxt,3,Wed Jun 24 15:20:12 2015 UTC,You mentioned that you squatted on Monday and did DL today. Have you tried separating them further? I would try putting Chest day in the middle of the week and do DL/Back day on Friday. This should help you with recovery.
leangains,3aykpx,tcoop2232,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:44:39 2015 UTC,Normally I alternate DL / Dips / Squat with a day rest between them. This is not any different than my previous routine so my body is used to this split & recovery.
leangains,3aykpx,dwightshoulders,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"I'm going to agree with this guy and say 1 day rest between heavy squat and DL is probably not enough rest. Why don't you at least try spacing them out further? I DL on Monday and squat on Thursday. Even with a 2 day break, I have to switch the two around every couple months because the lift I do after 3 days rest increases faster than the lift I do on 2 days."

leangains,3augef,Mickyhcorbett75,3,Wed Jun 24 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"u/Mickyhcorbett75 gave a superb answer, vary intensities. If you're focusing on High Intensity squats, RPT style, follow up with deadlift singles @80-90% 1RM. Work on technique in that range, it will translate to your 3-5RM.   Currently following Greg Nuckols idea of increasing work capacity ever so slightly   Track your volume/tonnage (weight x reps x sets), and increase it slightly each week.  I think you'd get better results with more volume than an RPT style workout. Strength is a skill, the more practise you have doing it, the better you will get at it. You will garner greater results by increasing the frequency of lifts. Do the Big 3 on both workouts and change up the rep ranges and do multiple sets. Add some OHP on one day and Chins/Rows on the other."
leangains,3augef,Mickyhcorbett75,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:13:50 2015 UTC,"To be clear here, I used to do 531 but then switched to RPT. My workout is:  A: Squat/Dips/Deadlift - alternate RPT (5 then 6 reps) with other compound using 75% sets. Dips are RPT on squat days, BW or lighter weight on DL days.   B: Bench/Pull-up/OHP - same scheme and RPT reps.   So I hit 4 big exercises (like 531) but minimise the types. It might not be optimised but it suits my work and life schedule.   So for OP, experiment and then stick to it but it doesn't have to be over complicated. Tweaks will probably come when you lift a lot heavier."

I alternate so that whatever is second gets sets of 5 at around 75%, just so I'm lifting each week.   I do 4 of these sets currently following Greg Nuckols idea of increasing work capacity ever so slightly. I'll maybe up the weight a bit or the reps depending on progress with the heavier weights.  It seems to help with heavier lift days at any rate."

The major downside for this setup was the fact the gym was smelly, packed, and full of super setting jerks all over taking up tons of equipment.

I have 3 meals. Two bigger ones at the start and at the end of the window, and a smaller one (basically a pre-workout snack) somewhere in the middle.  Bottom line pretty much is that it doesn't really matter at which time of the day you fast and which part of the day you make the feeding window.

The example in the article is a TDEE of 2500 w/ a 40% Difference --> 3000 calories on lift days (2500 x 1.2) and 2000 on rest days (2500 x 0.8).

leangains,3as03b,captainredbeered,7,Tue Jun 23 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"There is a serious benefit to adding speed work into your routines.  While the bar might not always move quickly as you reach heavier weights, it's more so about the explosiveness in the eccentric portion of the movement.  Think of the squat or bench press: you are slowly lowering the weight into the whole, maintaining your tightness you should be explosive out of the hole.  Think of this like a slingshot.     Again, speedwork is not so much about building speed as it is explosiveness."
leangains,3as03b,T_muld,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:00:39 2015 UTC,The explosiveness is the concentric.  Surely.
leangains,3as03b,garrisonMia,5,Fri Jul 3 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"A significant amount of muscle recruitment comes from the eccentric part of the lift. More muscle activation, more bang for your buck at the gym."

leangains,3as03b,MacNulty,2,Tue Jun 23 01:24:07 2015 UTC,"speed matters Don't worry about it yet   As long as you are increasing the weight, bring the bar down in a controlled fashion and being as 'explosive' as possible on the lift (even if you are slow as it's heavy) is probably the most well rounded way to lift.  http://www.bodybuilding.com/teen/shane6.htm  Later on or in addition (when you plateau or just trying to mix it up) you can focus on fast twitch muscle fibres by dropping the weight and doing the explosive  portion on the lift as fast as possible. (Think clap pressups, jump squats, short sprints).  There's also a different training method that I came across which incorporates doing the set incredibly slowly intentionally. 5 seconds to lower the bar and 5 seconds to raise it. Each rep is 10 seconds. Do 8 reps, 1 set and you're done.  rest time matters  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/topicoftheweek11.htm  3-5 minutes seems to be strength. 1-2 minutes to bulk (for various reasons such as your muscles induce more hormones under this kind of strain)  Yet you need the strength to lift heavy enough to bulk. This always throws me off. I would basically do 3-5 minute rest for about 4-6 weeks. And then switch to 1-2 minutes rest, and then back again.  Just don't go into the gym and do the same thing your muscles are used to every other day for a year."

leangains,3as03b,joshrexben,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:27:12 2015 UTC,"Don't let any idiot tell you otherwise: Speed is for using light weights or no weights. Anything higher, and you're asking your joints and shit to commit suicide. If you want more muscle recruitment, and you don't feel like your muscles are activating enough fibers, then add more weight, and do as many reps as possible, and try to do more than you can physically do, even if you're trying to finish that rep for 30 seconds and your arm ain't moving any higher, your fibers will tear and new ones will activate in desperation to keep the weight from falling. That's when your brain truly recruits more muscle fibers than it usually does, when other muscles are stressed and torn and it realizes it needs to recruit more to finish the contraction because it senses it ain't moving and doesn't want to drop.   If you want to build speed because you're a fighter or athlete, work on the speed alone, just you and your body. Weight has nothing to do with speed. Do you see any martial artists, speed runners, or guitar/violin/piano players playing with weights to build speed? Speed is about building deeper, stronger connections, and more focus, between the mind and body. If you want to go faster, just remain still at first, feel all your muscles that you're going to use for that motion get ready, and visualize yourself activating all of them as fast as possible, and then do it. Then repeat all those steps. Speed isn't about doing reps or using weights. Speed is about focusing for a long time, being totally aware of the body parts you're about to use, visualization, visualization, visualization, concentration, and then the biggest sudden burst of motion you can do. If it's a chop, visualize the shoulder bringing the arm down, and the tricep flexing and the bicep extending, all of that. Then after focusing on the muscles, and visualizing, you bring them down. Then repeat. Constant repetitions just to do repetitions doesn't build speed. Concentration and gaining more and more control over the muscle does.  Here's my advice, destroy your muscles in a workout with super high reps and moderate weights. Get them all torn and shit, and raw. Then, without any weights, you build your explosive speed. That way, your brain has already been used to using all of its muscles to lift the weights and stuff, you're all warmed up mentally and physically, and in order for your body to keep going your brain has to work harder to recruit more muscles at once to compensate for the ones that are too weak/torn to do those motions and move as fast as your brain is telling them to move.  If you're talking about muscle gains, it's all about slow and controlled movements with relatively heavy weights, slow in the contraction, and really really slow in the negative reps. Fight the pain and increase the reps if you want to gain more control and tear more fibers. People keep thinking you need to do the heaviest weights that you can lift at like one or 5 reps. No, it's the heaviest you can do at 15-20 reps, and then the most important part, trying to do one more rep than that, even if it looks like your arm or whatever can't finish it, you fight through it with all your might to finish that curl or tricep pull down, fight the pain, and your brain will try it's damndest to finish it by slowly noticing and sending activation signals to more and more muscle fibers.  That is how you increase the amount of muscle fibers recruited, not just trying to lift the heaviest weight possible. You need to spend a lot of time in the flex, trying really hard to get past the rep you finally fail at, after doing enough reps to pump blood and tear fibers all over the place. If a weight is too heavy, you don't tear as many. One thing you can do is start really heavy, then try to finish that last rep to failure, then move on to the next lowest weight. Move all the way down til you get to like 10 lbs, or just the bar, all without any more than like a 5-10 second rest in betweem. That is how you really tear and activate all the muscle fibers.  It's all about the constant effort and keep going and going and going until ACTUAL muscle failure.

The problem on a cut is that the physiological stress, and physical hunger you feel gets to you. I've tried eating one meal a day on a cut after after about a week, it felt too much. Eating 2-3 meals from 12 to 8 PM works better for me and the physical act of wanting to eat something.  That said, I think there are/could be hormonal advantages to eating one big meal rather than 2 or 3 like in LeanGains style (while still doing IF) in that pancreas isn't stimulated as much. There's an idea floating around that diabetes happen just as often in skinny people (older typically), and the question is why? They're skinny, and they don't have fat-cell based insulin resistance. So what's happening is that their pancreas' ability to produce insulin has decreased. The idea is that the pancreas and specifically beta cells (which release insulin) in the islets of langerhans have a finite amount of insulin it can produce in its lifetime. It's the idea that cells have a limited number of times they can divide and produce some substance before the chromosomal DNA gets damaged due to telomeric shortening.   In fact, this is one of the purported benefits of eating less meals & keto diets because in the former, your pancreas isn't always ""squirting"" juice throughout the day (1 time a day versus 3-8x a day depending on how may meals are taken), and in the latter, a keto diet that is high fat, moderate protein (because you don't need more than like .82 g of protein/lb of body weight or something like that for muscle synthesis and more protein is pointless since it will only needlessly spike insulin), and low carbs (typically 20 g or less which means you're basically stuck with veggies, and some whole foods that have a gram or 2 of carbs) will not utilize the pancreas as much."
leangains,3aqew9,AndreNowzick,2,Mon Jun 22 23:18:47 2015 UTC,"There's an idea floating around that diabetes happen just as often in skinny people (older typically), and the question is why?   Type II diabetes is the inability to control blood sugar levels despite a functioning pancreas, and it used to be called old-people diabetes where I come from. The fact is, intramyocellular lipids (fat in muscle cells) reduce insulin sensitivity and lead to diabetes type II. Caloric abundance (of any type) is the strongest predictor of insulin sensitivity, and it doesn't require obesity although being obese puts you at greater risk.  As it turns out, intramyocellular lipids increase with increasing age while total muscle mass decreases    That said, I think there are/could be hormonal advantages to eating one big meal rather than 2 or 3 like in LeanGains style (while still doing IF) in that pancreas isn't stimulated as much.   Insulin secretion is dose-dependent on blood sugar levels. A single larger meal takes that much longer to digest, and will result in a much larger time being spent í the ""fed"" state than a smaller meal. The important factor here is total calories and macronutrients, and not meal frequency.  I am currently not aware of any research indicating that the hayflick limit (limited cell reproduction cycles) applies to secretion of hormones. With aging, all physiological functions decrease. That is probably not related to the total lifetime amount of work cells were required to perform.   If your plan is to use keto to live longer or better, consider that all the oldest and healthiest populations on earth (aka blue zones) have been high carbohydrate eaters."

You seem to actually have pretty decent core genetics, so that is a positive.  Get into a routine (Starting Strength would be a great start - and it'll take the guesswork out of your rep range questions) and eat at maintenance until you get a firm grasp on your TDEE - 2 solid weeks of tracking and weight monitoring should get you there.  You may be able to put on some muscle in a small cut (.75 lbs/week) for a while. Once you stop making gains, sorry, you've got to up your cals and forget about getting cut - you need muscle to have a physique that looks good at low body fat.  You're not there...yet."

Seems kinda low to just call someone out like that.  Personally, I would not advise a skinnyfat person to eat below maintenance while they lift. With that said, I understand that that is the popular advice here in leangains and I am sure that it works too.  My reasoning is that, your noob gains only last for about a year. This is a very precious time that you will never get back. Do you really want to waste it eating at a deficit and limiting the amount of lean mass you can add? Because even if you are adding some lean mass at a deficit, it won't be nearly as much as if you are at a surplus. If the dude was seriously overweight/obese, that would be one thing, but he is just skinny with a little pudgy belly. Might as well permabulk for a year and then cut it all away to reveal dat dere chiseled physique."
leangains,3apkn2,GothicToast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:37:14 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't think about it like he should maximize his gains in the undefined newbie phase and, in retrospect, probably should have.  Trying to get as strong as possible in a year would leave him disappointed with his physique for about 18 months, but those 18 months could set him up with a solid baseline to which to cut to for the foreseeable future.  Its an interesting spot to be in.  It takes mental fortitude to stick with something for 18 months without getting what you want, and couple that with the fact that he is actively holding himself back from that ripped goal physique - that is a lot to take on mentally.  In my opinion, he's going for aesthetics, and he probably wants them sooner rather than later.  Might as well get as cut as long as he can while making strength gains, and start his lean bulk in the 14-15% bf range.  I'd be interested in any anecdotal evidence of either being successful.  I think OP is in a spot, and I do not mean this insultingly, where a lot of females find themselves. ""Skinnyfat"" physique is far more common on the Eve side of things...and in my mind, they're trying to get into mini bikinis THIS summer, not next summer - hence the slow cut and even slower gains.  Working from the inside out (gains) and the outside in (diet).  As long as you can make gains in the gym and watch the scale drop - why not ya kno?"

Yes, I think this is a good point. If you have the mental fortitude to forego the initial cut, then I think you will set yourself up better down the line. However, if skipping the initial cut will make you frustrated and burn out, quitting the gym altogether, then obviously cutting first would be the way to go. After all, the most important factor for muscle growth is consistency and adherence. Nobody is making gains by sitting on the couch!"

Don't worry too much about any extra fat atm; it's negligible. You should focus on adding some muscles to your frame and there are plenty of how-to's in the side bare (hint: Macro Calculator).   As for training, you know the drill: compound lifts, good form, 3 times a week to start and keep focusing on progressive overload. Stay with RPT as your preferrered protocol - maybe add 1 more set (to a total of 3 per exercise) when ""bulking"" - and aim for 6-7 reps before adding weights to the bar.   Track your macros and training and you can gain 1-2lbs a month."

Do not cut. I don't know why you're getting that advice. Listen I was EXACTLY you, literally same body type. Back in august I started lifting heavy and I'm pretty happy with where I am.  I used to be 180 pure skinny fat.  I could barely put up 135 on bench or squat, and i could deadlift about 185.  I honestly didn't track my eating for the first 5 months but ate an average ammount mostly meat potato and tortillas and egg and rice. (not the best nutriotion by any stretch).  I lifted prob 3 -5 times a week sometimes less.  I actually lost a bunch of weight through this, mainly cause my eating stayed the same but I was doing high intensity high weight workouts.  I dropped to about 169 (at 6""1). So I went from skinny fat to skinny, but got some nice gains in strength and muscle tone (175 bench, 185 squat, 240 deadlift).  This was doing splits (chest/tri, bi/back, legs/shoulders)  I then plateud for a month and had very minor gains mostly in deadlift and a little squat but 0 gains in bench.    Since, I switched to isolation (chest day, arm day, back day, leg day, abs/shoulders) and I got protein powder and I drink 3-4 shakes a day.  I try to eat as much as I can but I honestly don't eat enough still but trying to fix that.  I also started taking pre workout before lifting.  I rep 200 in bench and did 225 for the first time ever a week ago. I rep about 215 on squat (still trying to recover from chicken legs), and deadlift 325 max, rep 290.  If you really want a picture I can pm it to you but I don't wanna post on internet.  My advice: don't worry about ""cutting"". Just don't eat unhealthy food and eat a lot of the good stuff (meat, eggs, rice, vegetables, fruit, nuts).  Lift hard as fuck and go 5 times a week.  Start with splits or push/pull if you want but switch to isolation when you start to taper.  The main thing is to stay consistent.  I also do crunches in between sets of leg lifts, or other core stuff and I now have 90% a six pack from having a belly like you."

If you want to drink whey before you work out at 9 a.m., then do it. If you want to train fasted, then do it. If you want BCAAs, then do it. No one here seems to understand that it's not the end of the world to do things differently. But adjust your fasting time period accordingly, meaning stop eating at ~3 p.m. so you can have whey in the morning if you choose to do so. If that doesn't work for you, drink whey and be semi-fasted. Or take BCAAs and spend extra money. Or just break the fast early and make your caloric goals your priority.  Personally, I drink whey before I work out. My workouts take ~20-30 minutes so by the time I'm done, the whey is being digested.  Or just experiment and figure out what works for you. Seriously. The effect between whey and BCAAs is negligible for most people. Try using whey for one week and BCAAs for another. If one makes you feel better, then use that one."

leangains,3aozil,MrSquat,6,Mon Jun 22 11:26:16 2015 UTC,"I'd guess 10% as well, but I don't think that's particularly relevant to be honest. Do you like your current look? Would you like to be leaner?  Also, if you are planning to bulk make sure you go for a gradual deficit on focus on strength gains and not weight. And do some squats for the love of all that is holy. Unless you compete in pullups."
leangains,3aozil,aesthetic-as-fuck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:40:06 2015 UTC,"I specificially put whole body picture to better show whole body development. My legs do look skinny, I agree.  You are right, I should do more squats. My upper body is much stronger than the lower body. I do Benchpress with 110 kg (245) 6-7 reps and bent-over rows with the same weight. But my working weight on squats is the same 110-120kg. And you should consider my squat amplitude (I don't even hit the parallel and go higher) due to lower back issues. So I got to get stronger legs. I will.  I don't like my looks. I definetly want to be leaner. Because during bulking I might add some fat and it won't look good on my skinny frame.   But I am already too fucking light as I see it. Definetly need to add some meat to my bones."
leangains,3aozil,blindpet,2,Mon Jun 22 11:14:17 2015 UTC,Honestly you'd look way better with just better legs.  You're DYEL below the waist and look strong and lean above the waist.  I would start squatting 3x/week.

You guys drink your black coffee on ice ever or how do you switch up your coffee if at all?  I've found I like mine with a splash of the Torani syrups http://shop.torani.com/.  They have way more flavors online; I've only tried SF french vanilla.
leangains,3apaxa,ehmbie,3,Mon Jun 22 18:24:30 2015 UTC,You could make cold-brew coffee. You dump coffee grounds into water and let it sit in the fridge for a day or so. Pour it through something to strain out the coffee grounds and you're done. Much better than watery coffee.
leangains,3apaxa,cforres,2,Mon Jun 22 18:49:48 2015 UTC,Never heard of such a thing.  I use an aeropress so I have some control over the strength but doing it that way would be more convenient for sure.
leangains,3apaxa,ehmbie,3,Mon Jun 22 19:05:00 2015 UTC,"I think it tastes better too, less acidic than hot brewed or something.

I eat a very high-fiber diet which slows down digestion. It certainly doesn't hurt, and might even help. Especially if you have issues late in the fast or dealing with strength drops it's something to consider.

leangains,3apaxa,bms88,2,Mon Jun 22 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"The accessory movements don't have to be done with a reverse pyramid setup.  Also, barbell hip thrusts would be a good exercise to add if you opt of of RDL."

Suffering from severe Fuckarounitis, need to make a decision and stick to it. Would be great if I could get /r/Leangains advice.  To keep a long story short, I'm constantly (for absolutely no reason, I know this) worrying that what I'm doing at the gym isn't the optimal use of my time/energy. I want to make a decision today and stick with it and I need your help /r/leangains. The one constant this year has been the LG and IF lifestyle of tracking macros and eating. I just enjoy it's simplicity.  Would cutting down to a more 'abs lean' look be worth it in the long run, or is diving right into a lean bulk going to start me on the right foot more? I ask because I've seen some advice on RippedBody regarding cutting down first before bulking as it has some hormonal advantages.  If a cut is the way to go, from what I've read RPT routines can't be beat for the deficit you're working with. Has anyone had decent success in strength AND aesthetic/mass gains with something like SL + Accessories while cutting? The app is very sleek and I think will help me not change my routine.  If a lean bulk (+1750ish kcal/week), my plan is to go the SL route (unless someone can convince me otherwise) with some accessory work. Again, I feel the app will go a long way to keeping me on track. And It seems I can add the power pack to be able to adjust down to 3x5 once i absolutely can't get past some plateau.  Stats: 170 lb Male at 25 yr old. Dont know body fat, but eye test I would say in the 12-15% range?  Bench: 185 x8  Squat: 200 x8  Dead: 300 x5  OHP: 120 x8  Goal: Get stronger, but also build more muscle without getting 'chunky'  Edit: Just wanted to add that I am desperate. I've been tracking macros and following LG since about January. Initially I was happy with some of the cutting that occurred, but then idk what went wrong. I've been spinning my wheels a bit. Strength gains have been there, decently steady. But not making the aesthetic progress I wanted. This spiraled me into a ""maybe i should try bulking, hmm its been 3 weeks, maybe cutting"" hell hole. I like the gym, I enjoy lifting. I just want it to feel like what Im doing there is working. Please help :'(  Edit 2: Leaving work and wont be on, but if anyone does respond to this and has follow up questions for me, I'll answer as soon as I can. Thanks in advance."

Unless I add fat to my last meal of the day or eat a real fatty cut of meat, the high carb foods are typically so filling (fiber) that a fat intake that low is no problem.   On rest days - I'll be closer to 60g or so.  I'd suggest you try eating what the calculator suggests for a few days.  If you don't like how it makes you feel then tweak it a little bit at a time until you feel better (full, libido, energy levels).

I've got a 3 month LG cut behind me and I really like the set up with RPT 3 times a week (not just practical but I made some strength gains from it as well). So, why change a winning combo?  What I'm thinking is this:   Add 1 extra set to my compound lifts (total of 3) Add 1 accessory each session (curls, push-downs, calf press etc.) Instead of training MWF I thought I'd just do ""Workout 1, Workout 2"" etc. and train every other day - effectively adding 2 extra training days per month   Thoughts/experiences?

I usually either get a bowl and get the tortilla on the side and eat it Arab style by making bites lol or get a burrito and get it double wrapped. Perfect when you need extra carbs. Chipotle is awesome in that everything extra, other than meat and guac, is pretty much free.   Oh and btw I worded my previous reply wrong. I usually get 2 extra servings of meat, so 3 total, sometimes 4. I figure I'm paying $7 initially but can triple the protein for half of that. I don't eat there often but when I do it's pretty epic haha usually get home and have a tub of cottage cheese with some minor toppings (berries, cacao powder, etc), about 55g protein, and call it a day as far as eating."

leangains,3afc4a,chiralC,8,Fri Jun 19 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"I've maintained the same lifting frequency for years, I didn't change after reaching particular strength levels.  What I don't understand either is most people will agree on weekly or even fortnightly calorie calculations and stuff but no one ever looks further than a week in terms of lifting schedules.  Lets assume 100% adherence but I know we all have days off  -   I work out every other day on an ABC schedule. This means I get 182 workouts a year and 61 deadlifting sessions and 61 squat sessions.  People who work out 3 times a week get 156 sessions a year, 52 deadlifts and 52 squats for example.  Will people make noticeably more progress with the extra work?  Over the course of a year or two then yes they definitely will in my opinion (given the right intensity and progressive overload).  Now weigh that up against the freedom of not having set days for set workouts meaning it's easier to roll things forward if you need to.    I know everyone thinks their method is the best, but at least consider changing and try things out for yourself and see how they work.  Break away from this MWF mentality and see what happens.    I simply can't for the life of me think why people put themselves through a weekend of eating rest day meals.  I am absolutely convinced (you can try and argue but I won't believe you) that most people stagnate because they end up pigging out on their weekends.    My way - if you can't wait a single day to fulfil your cravings then you're never ever gonna succeed anyway.    That's my take on it all anyway."
leangains,3afc4a,tontyboy,2,Fri Jun 19 19:39:42 2015 UTC,"I like the logic behind it. And you think the extra sessions allow you to progress more than the additional rest? Ex. micro loading each session by a pound or less vs. possibly making bigger jumps in weight over a longer length of time? (probably way overthinking it)  For example, today I deadlifted and was nearly on the floor in exhaustion after my top set. I guess I'm concerned that my lower back just isn't recovered enough after one rest day to go balls to the wall squatting for the next session, especially on a cut.   I imagine that you view it like anything else- whether it's a lack of sleep, a hangover, life in general, etc. that happens to fall on a lift day. I wonder if my lifts would decrease or stagnate a bit in the beginning then readjust as I got used to it.  Out of curiosity, how's your adherence with this type of schedule? If you go out with your buddies and get hammered/have a trip or whatever, do you just suck it up and do the lifts or is this exactly the type of scenario you were referring to by ""roll things forward""? (I suppose this is more of a personality question instead of having to do directly with the lifting schedule)."

leangains,3acnic,musclehacking,11,Fri Jun 19 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"This is cool stuff, but let's make sure we interpret this type of data objectively.  The problem with these types of studies when used as evidence for the beneficial effects of fasting (as we on LG see it) is that they also involve calorie restriction. Calorie restriction has been relatively well established to enhance longevity, and when it's mixed with fasting it is hard to determine whether or not the fasting on its own would replicate the same beneficial results.   I'm on my mobile so I can't dig deeper into the studies at the moment, but two other things that come to mind are:  a) What was their diet like before the study period? Would anyone be surprised if going from a surplus of big macs to a deficit of vegetable soup improved health & age biomarkers?   b) What do they define as fasting in the study? They have to specify as it can vary a lot depending on the authors. The word 'fasting' can be used to describe a prolonged (and usually large) calorie deficit - regardless of the ""eating window"".   edit - typo"
leangains,3acnic,e1_duder,5,Fri Jun 19 05:46:17 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article or the paper at all?  a) While I agree that diet before and after the study period could affect results, participants were asked to eat a fasting mimicking diet for 5 days a month for three months.  Other than these 5 days, they were instructed to not change their normal diet and exercise habits.  While participants could have changed their diets during the 3 months they participated, and we don't know what they ate before they started to participate in the study, but given that this was not something controlled for in the experiment, it seems to suggest that it does not matter.  The main point I got from this paper was that regardless of your eating habits, restricting your caloric intake for 5 days a month can be beneficial for your health.  But, the beauty of science is that this study can be replicated and these variables can be accounted for.  b) The fasting mimicking diet, from the paper:   The development of the human diet took into account feasibility (e.g., high adherence to the dietary protocol) and therefore was designed to last 5 days every month and to provide between 34% and 54% of the normal caloric intake with a composition of at least 9%–10% proteins, 34%–47% carbohydrates, and 44%–56% fat.    From the article:     Day one of the diet comprises:  10 per cent protein, 56 per cent fat and 34 per cent carbohydrate, making 1,090 calories  Days two to five: Nine per cent protein, 44 per cent fat and 47 per cent carbohydrate making 725 calories    Also, the paper provides more details on fasting and intermittent fasting:   Fasting, the most extreme form of DR, which entails the abstinence from all food, but not water, can be applied in a chronic manner as intermittent fasting (IF) or periodically as cycles of prolonged fasting (PF) lasting 2 or more days (Longo and Mattson, 2014).  [...] In humans, IF and less-severe regimens (e.g., consumption of approximately 500 kcal/day for 2 days a week) have beneficial effects on insulin, glucose, C-reactive protein, and blood pressure (Harvie et al., 2011)."
leangains,3acnic,musclehacking,2,Fri Jun 19 13:19:23 2015 UTC,"You've completely missed the point of my comment. Let me breakdown a few things you've overlooked:   but given that this was not something controlled for in the experiment, it seems to suggest that it does not matter. The main point I got from this paper was that regardless of your eating habits, restricting your caloric intake for 5 days a month can be beneficial for your health.   Whoa there. A study not controlling for a variable does not automatically make the variable unimportant. Changing subjects from their regular Western diets to their regular Western diets + 5 days of calorie restriction/month (with non-""junky"" foods, eg. vegetable soup) is unsurprisingly going to lead to beneficial results.  Again, cool stuff - but this is /r/leangains and the purpose of posting studies such as this is to extrapolate/relate them to the leangains protocol. I don't think this type of study can be extrapolated to -> leangains-style fasting is beneficial. It's just not direct enough of a link.   It would be quite a stretch to relate 5 days/month of calorie restriction on a low protein diet (9-10%) to a 16 hour/day fast on a lean bulk with >50% of you calories from protein (which would be what you're doing if following LG long-term).   The fasting mimicking diet, from the paper:  The development of the human diet took into account feasibility (e.g., high adherence to the dietary protocol) and therefore was designed to last 5 days every month and to provide between 34% and 54% of the normal caloric intake with a composition of at least 9%–10% proteins, 34%–47% carbohydrates, and 44%–56% fat.   My point exactly. This is not fasting as we on LG see it. To extrapolate this to a leangains protocol is simply unscientific.   And lastly, I think you were confused by the introduction. Yes they defined what IF and PF were (their definition of IF in particular is the closest regime to leangains), but that's meaningless in terms of the study itself if they didn't follow the IF guidelines they set out. The intro was simply to set-up their base for the direction of their study. The beneficial effects from IF the author is reporting is from another study altogether - and is irrelevant in terms of what this study can offer on its own."

Changing subjects from their regular Western diets to their regular Western diets + 5 days of calorie restriction/month (with non-""junky"" foods, eg. vegetable soup) is unsurprisingly going to lead to beneficial results.   The study suggests that 5 days of caloric restriction a month is beneficial regardless of what your baseline diet is.  The researchers compiled baseline information and compared everything to that information in both groups.  Its not surprising that anyone, regardless of their baseline diet, would lose weight if they reduced their caloric intake by 40% for 5 days a month.  Nothing really about this study is surprising, its just nice to see the information quantified.     My point exactly. This is not fasting as we on LG see it. To extrapolate this to a leangains protocol is simply unscientific.   That wasn't your question.  You asked how the study defined fasting, so I provided both the ""fasting mimicking diet"" definition and also how they defined fasting in general in the article.

I can guarantee that some of the 100+ up votes on this post right now just saw the title and went ""Yep, another study that says fasting is good. All hail leangains"". My point was to objectively look at the data in relation to its relevancy to /r/leangains - not discard the study altogether.   I read the article but didn't have access to the study at the time, so I posed two questions to help promote discussion on the topic. The questions were specific to the study quoted by the article and its relevancy to leangains, and neither of those questions were answered in the article itself."

I've hit these same weights for more reps in the past.  Heading into the gym in a bit and I will not leave without smashing through whatever is holding me back."

leangains,3ae7pb,joeeeeee_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:11:36 2015 UTC,i tried hook grip once.  man that shit hurt for days.  couldn't even use a lighter for like half a week.  good luck with that shit.  mixed grip was a lifesaver for me and chalk didn't hurt either.
leangains,3ae7pb,simple_mech,2,Fri Jun 19 15:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yea I know I shouldn't but I always use chalk for my top set. The way I see it, I'm here to work my deadlift and any extra grip strength is cool. I'm not about to drop well over 4 plates and fuck up my set because it slipped out of my hand. I'll then wash my hands and hit my second set raw. The longer set should work my grip more than my quick top set anyway."
leangains,3ae7pb,joeeeeee_,5,Fri Jun 19 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"i would say chalk isn't bad for top set or even backoff.  its helping with grip but not nearly like straps do so you are still building some grip strength.  and i don't know if it's just my gym, but i swear someone greases those fucking barbells!  i have to wipe them down with my towel before i even begin my warm up sets."
leangains,3ae7pb,bms88,2,Fri Jun 19 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"I always chalk up for the top set and leave whatever chalk remains on the bar for the second set.  The chalk doesn't do the lifting for you, and I'm sure as hell not gonna risk missing reps just because I'm a sweaty mess."
leangains,3ae7pb,bms88,2,Fri Jun 19 18:26:14 2015 UTC,It's kinda comical but the pain from the hook grip is so unbearable that it helps keep my mind off the struggle of deadlifting.  Problem is that you can't expect to continue the set if you lose grip tightness whereas you can make slight adjustments with a regular or mixed grip.
leangains,3ae7pb,joeeeeee_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"yeah i guess i could see that.  my other problem was i pop/crack my knuckles and fingers a lot out of boredom, so i'm pretty used to what joints can pop and the angle my fingers need to be to make said pop.....  but that first pull with hook grip... never had my thumbs made pops like that hahah.  scared the fuck outta me for a second but then the pain set in and i couldn't think of anything else besides the bar crushing into the bones of my poor thumbs"

I do a day for each of the big 3 and do accessories to support those and bring up my many weaknesses. I've been on a cut, and went from 280lbs in the DL to 415x5.  The big jump is mainly because I started really light with higher volume to acquire skill and protect my spine.

If this can be accomplished, then the rush of post workout carbs will mostly go towards replenishing those reserves and not be converted/stored as fat.  being as close to depletion at the end of training is the ideal goal with this system."

leangains,3ac1qe,The_1_In_21-1,3,Fri Jun 19 10:38:14 2015 UTC,"We can start with the diet portion since it is the most important. A concept you should make yourself familiar with is energy, in terms of food that energy is measured in calories. If your maintenance (TDEE) is 2000 cals and you eat 1500 cals of chicken or cheetos, you will lose weight. If you eat 2500 cals, chicken or cheetos, you will gain weight. 3500 cals is 1lb. Since 500 * 7=3500, in both scenarios you will lose/gain 1lb respectively. So fat is just stored energy (calories).   Excellent post! In the paragraph I quoted above, might want to clarify that that pound is lost/gained from a week of either deficit or surplus. I know it's a small leap but some people might not understand. Just an idea"

leangains,3ac1qe,EricAndersonL,3,Thu Jun 18 23:28:03 2015 UTC,Yes but whether you are in a surplus or a deficit is determined by your weekly caloric intake.
leangains,3ac1qe,mmm_migas,2,Thu Jun 18 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"New comer here. Thanks for the helpful post and clearing up some questions! My BMI is currently at 20% and I'm interested in the leangains method to cut. My starting goal is to loose 1lb a week. To clarify, if I set my daily calorie intake to 2,550 (maintenance is 2,800 cal) I would need to burn 500 cal a day to reach that goal?"
leangains,3ac1qe,200gorillas,2,Fri Jun 19 17:24:29 2015 UTC,2800 - 2550 = 250   250 * 7 = 1750   3500 - 1750 = 1750   So you'd need to burn 250 per day to get to 500 deficit per day and therefore like 1lb/week.

Rest Day: 1768 Calories. 259g Protein. 88g Carb. 74g Fat. That is for somebody at 200lbs. If you want to know what your macros should be, just adjust based on your weight.

The reason I ask is because I currently lift 3 times a week, but also do jiu jitsu 3 times a week (""rest"" days) for a total of 5-7 hours weekly and for anyone that's done BJJ or wrestled knows this is among the most intense types of cardio you can do.  Now, we're not going at it for 2 hours at a time as its a majority drilling and practicing techniques, but free rolling sessions do happen several times weekly which can be 5-10min long. These are usually all out and very cardio intensive.

leangains,3ab5sv,Top5ive,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"I was in your position previously and what I did was hit maintenance calories and do starting strength. I wanted to focus on perfecting my form on the 3 major compounds and developing a strength base. You'll develop balance, strength and lean muscle as well as gradually lose fat by following this.  Once you have a reasonable amount of strength and size go on a slow lean bulk along with a more advanced strength routine such as 5x5 and keep progressing from there."
leangains,3ab5sv,cheesecakeLord,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, developing a good base for the rest of my training is what I want to do right now. The goal that I stated was more a long-term/endgame goal, I'll keep what you said in mind. Thanks!"
leangains,3ab5sv,AC5L4T3R,2,Thu Jun 18 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yep. Just make sure to track your macros, some ""bros"" might tell you to just eat eat eat and lift heavy but it isn't this simple.   The more accurate you are the more progress you'll make and I can't stress this enough. You need to be sure you're fueling your body right so you grow.  Use MyFitnessPal, track your macros, lift with good form and get plenty of sleep and you'll definitely progress. If you have any other questions message me I'll be more than happy to help you out my friend.  Best of luck! :)"

leangains,3a6boh,tontyboy,28,Wed Jun 17 15:57:23 2015 UTC,Worrying more about reaching a goal weight on the scale during a cut rather than reaching a goal weight on the bar.  Edit : applies to bulk as well.
leangains,3a6boh,fostok,14,Wed Jun 17 16:00:57 2015 UTC,Love it! Hate the term goal weight it is meaningless. People should have a goal physique and goal strength levels not a goal weight.
leangains,3a6boh,the7comeback7kid,2,Wed Jun 17 16:19:21 2015 UTC,My goal weight has changed three times since I started this cut but my goal physique has remained the same. The goal weight is just a way to keep track of my progress towards the goal physique which will come eventually as I lose enough fat
leangains,3a6boh,ipv6fx,2,Wed Jun 17 21:21:21 2015 UTC,This is a good point. If my weight is going up chances are that physique ain't coming
leangains,3a6boh,ipv6fx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"Well, that depends on your goals. My goals are both physique and strength, but at the same time, if you compete on a sport, you may need to be under a certain weight class, which means one of your goal, a considerably important one may be a set weight."
leangains,3a6boh,GusSawchuk,2,Thu Jun 18 09:04:38 2015 UTC,"I am speaking in the context of the people on this forum. I can't recall many, if any people on here cutting for weight class reasons.   But along the same lines, you can cut a lot of weight ""pre weigh in"" via water manipulation. So I think the point still stands. Even if you had to cut to 170 for a sport, you wouldn't strictly be dieting to 170 would you."
leangains,3a6boh,74152963741593,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:08:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a general context you are right, at the same time, if you had to cut from 172 to 170, that would make sense (using water manipulation), but if you had to cut more than 5 pounds, and a 2 hours weight in, there are no many options other than cutting fat."
leangains,3a6boh,cforres,4,Thu Jun 18 09:21:40 2015 UTC,"Same here, except with bulking.  I've worried too much about putting on fat when I should be increasing my calories so I can get stronger."
leangains,3a6boh,bladetips,2,Wed Jun 17 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"This so much. I wanted to be 180 so bad so I bulked hard, but ended up putting on alot of fat."
leangains,3a6boh,OuHiroshi,2,Wed Jun 17 16:34:29 2015 UTC,this is me.  I wanted so much to reach 185.  I've been hovering between 192-194 last 2 weeks (down 20ish lbs total) and I'm coming to the realization that the scale is a horrible goal.
leangains,3a6boh,bms88,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:39:58 2015 UTC,Do you mind elaborating?   I'm cutting right now and all I'm thinking about is the goal weight..   Maybe I could lessen the damage of my mistake.
leangains,3a6boh,soci4ldrinkr,2,Thu Jun 18 00:03:17 2015 UTC,"For me it's about having the right mindset to the whole process. If all I want is to weigh 165 lbs, that doesn't full take into account what my goal really is. I want a strong/aesthetic looking physique and just wanting to be 165 lbs is not complete enough. Now if I want to weigh 165 and be in the 1000# club that paints a more complete picture, of the amount of dedication and true strength/muscle I will have. I can lose 5# and bench 185# easy you know? No one is going to be impressed at a 5 lb weight lost, if i lost 10 lbs off my bench at the same time.   When I cut again, I will more likely go with a timeframe rather than a goal weight. i.e. i will be in a calorie deficit for 12 weeks and try to maintain all my lifts or add to them. That would be a good cut, to me at least."

Of course I always wonder why I get so burned out and usually end up injuring myself, then start gaining weight again.  LG taught me that less is more. Three, hour-long workouts per week and eating at a slight deficit has yielded me far better results and more progress than at any other time in my life. It's all about consistency.

Did it for a few days then put away the foodscale, thinking I was already experienced enough to eyeball it. Nope. Got sloppy quickly.  Also, a recent revelation: If you're thinking of missing the day's workout, DO NOT do it the next day. You missed it, you missed it. By giving yourself an ""out"" this time, you make it easier for you to postpone in the future.   I work out Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays. In the past when I've missed my Tuesday I've resolved to make it up on Wednesday, and sometime I have. But then I've let that slide to Thursday, and finally justified my delay by attempting to ""double up"" my Tuesday and Friday workouts. Which leaves me tired and (you guessed it) not wanting to do my Sunday workout.  Vicious circle. Now I eliminate the rationalization option by saying nope: you're either doing your Tuesday workout on Tuesday or not at all. No sliding around."

I don't have a tuesday workout, just an A B and C.  Even without ever missing a day I have 7 weeks until I do the same session on the same day.

Whenever I get round to it I'll test my 5 rep max and see what it is and then do a write up.   Basically I don't think bench is all that, there's little crossover in strength into other areas and I like experimenting. Being strong at deadlifting makes you strong at lots of other things. Being strong at bench makes you strong at bench. Look up a bench press record holder, who wants to look like that.   It's in the big 3 because of powerlifting basically, and I genuinely don't know why people who wanna look like Brad Pitt are so obsessed with it."

leangains,3a6boh,penisstroke,2,Thu Jun 18 15:06:41 2015 UTC,"Calves - it doesn't take long, and I personally see results so that's why.   Curls - I had never done them before so thought I would experiment. Again, doesn't take long and no adverse effects so might leave them in a little while longer. I also kind of disagree with the whole chin ups for biceps argument too. It is a much more complete whole body exercise than it's given credit for. And whilst I'm hardly an authority on it, curls are shit on because it's all newbies do. I don't see a problem with any accessory exercise, within reason, as long as your main strength and physique is at pretty good standards."

Also get a doorway chinup bar (or use  monkey bars in a park, if that's an option) and get in bunches of intense chins/pullups 3-4 days a week - again, 5 minutes of time.  tl/dr: don't get fat, squeeze in 10-15 mins of intense exercise 2-4 days per week, work on gym access over time"

If you're having brown rice then why not potatoes? Higher fiber, super high potassium, amazing satiety. Seriously have not heard a good argument for rice other than ""it's cheap"".

Rice has a better micronutrient profile (far from containing almost no micro nutrients) while pasta has more fiber and protein.  Potatoes and other root vegetables pretty much kill both rice and potatoes on every front. White potatoes are pretty much the perfect carb for cutting due to the vitamin b levels, fiber, and resistant starch content.  Another huge contender is green peas. They are more expensive per calorie with a slightly worse b-vitamin profile from potatoes but pack way more fiber and protein.   The great thing about white rice, aside from the price, and the main reason I eat them is because they carry sauces so well and they keep for a while in a refrigerator.

leangains,3a6boh,knockout2281,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"Yea but if compare where those calories are coming from, pasta has approximately double the protein that rice does and half the fat.   100g whole wheat pasta: 350 cals, 1.4F/75C/8fiber/15P and double the iron and calcium  100g brown rice: 370 cals, 2.9F/77C/3.5fiber/8P about double the vit-B6 but that's easier to get than iron  What do you mean about the sauce? Pasta is MADE to carry sauce. Do you mean they absorb soy sauce and such better? And I've always found pasta to reheat better than rice but that's probably because of the sauce that keeps it moist.   Yea but green peas have a much higher sugar content, which isn't bad, but they need a carrier like potatoes, rice or pasta.   Beets really are the shit. I get the ""love beets"" they sell at Costco. It's like 4 vacuum sealed packs, each holding like 4-5 beets. Organic and precooked, all I have to do is open a pack and chop 2-3 up in my salad and pop the other 1-2 like candy."

The absolute best way to go about shit is to focus on the big 3 because they will develop your entire body.  Address preferences like shoulder width and biceps height with accessories.  You can do that shit every day if you want, but get good at the big 3 and increase the fucking weight. Never sticking to a program or just a made-up/good-enough routine for at least 3 months straight.  This is how you make progress over the long haul,  not by reading T-nation blogs and latching onto new lifts and styles whenever what you're currently doing feels hard.  You change shit up and ultimately you end up spending way too much time moving the same weight...only these 3 weeks it's dips whereas the previous 3 weeks it was BB tri extensions.

However because of this feeling I realized that no matter how much I research something taking action is more important. It allows you to see the holes in your plan quicker and also see how you respond to certain changes / issues. In short there is no perfect plan. Stop researching and start doing.  Focusing more on my protein macros than my caloric goals which ended up making me overeat (during a cut)  5 day body split, waste of time especially during a cut. Made little progress  7 meals a day. Always hungry, always eating, always cooking  Looking at calories on a day to day basis instead of a weekly, monthly approach.  ...things I still fuck up...  I can eat this X (chocolate bar, chips, bread) and then I won't eat Y later.  I end up eating both mostly because X is always something super high calorie with little satiety.  On rest days thinking I can up my calories by a little bit while I am hungry...leads to I can eat X and it's OK.  (still trying to figure out a balance between eating low on rest days and being consistent)  Eating dinner with my family. Trying to adjust macros on the fly during dinner sucks. I now reserve 300 calories for my family meal and try to hit my macros pretending I eat 300 cals less.

Strict keto on rest days and measured carb loading post workout. Enough to fuel recovery, not an excess to fully kick me out.   I already have a lean frame and my workouts are bodyweight based routines (ie. limited bulking). I, as do many, personally choose  to remain in ketosis for the reasons I stated above, not as a weight loss tool so body fat % is not  a factor for me at all.   On a side note I was going to take your reply personally, but then I read your comment history and see you yell at everyone and hate keto so I feel better. Seriously though... Umbrellas for sun shade."
leangains,3a6et8,skippybosco,-2,Thu Jun 18 10:04:37 2015 UTC,I follow the advice you gave out a week ago actually.  Strict keto on rest days   you yell at everyone and hate keto so I feel better.    ummmm.  I don't hate keto.  My diet has been less strict since I finished the BTFC competition and I've actually had more keto days than carb days in the 19 days since the finish.  What I hate is the unwavering devotion and kult like attitude towards keto that is demonstrated on various reddit subs.  Keto is a great tool but it should not be the only tool in someones arsenal.  It has its time and place but it should never be the default approach and once someone is lean enough there is nothing wrong with experimentation with increased carb intake.  Try telling the above to anyone in ketogains and their heads will literally explode.

I think this is where we may not see eye to eye, which is ok! I don't choose to live a keto lifestyle as an experiment or a tool, for weight loss or otherwise. It is my default normal that has been very sustainable over the years allowing me to maintain my weight when I want, or bulk when I choose to.

leangains,3a6et8,clubmanager,5,Fri Jun 19 13:02:53 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear your results. A few things:   You dropped 10lbs+ so you weren't on a recomp, you were cutting. Just clarifying terminology for the new guys around.   Telling us you didn't eat on Mondays without your workout schedule doesn't help man. Was this a rest day? Workout day? If it was one of the 2 consecutive rest days, which one was it?   Great job but honestly try to avoid the chips. Have the cheese if you want but getting yourself used to eating salty fried potatoes will eventually lead to a binge and you'll hate yourself.   High five on the whipped cream though. Shit has such low calories for the satisfaction it provides, I love it. I'm known to just go to town on a bottle. 2 tbsp per serving, 10 servings and 10 calories per serving. Kill a bottle and it's only 100 calories! Amazing stuff."
leangains,3a6et8,simple_mech,4,Wed Jun 17 16:43:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.    Sorry on the terminology screwup.  I just meant to say that I added lean mass at the same time I was burning off fat, according to dunk tank before and after (not sure how accurate that is considered to be around here, but it was at least with the same guy & tank) and I was in the very fun 'beginner gains' mode.  Primary motivation though was and is removing fat, i.e. cutting.  I didn't explain the workout schedule well - due to family and work commitments it's very difficult to make it the same day each week consistently, so I do minimum one  weeknight and one weekend morning, and add a second weeknight whenever it fits, hence the 2.3 times/week average.  I prefer Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays when possible.  Anyone with a couple of kids can probably relate - you take the gaps when you can get them, which is why time efficiency/RPT is so important.  I never workout twice without a 48 hour rest in between.  I fast every Sunday night to Tuesday night.  I prefer not to workout on Monday evening (tried it once) as it makes for an uncomfortably hungry Tuesday.  I'm confident enough in fasting now, though, that if a Monday was my one weeknight opening for the week, I'd do it anyway.   There's a certain satisfaction & mental toughness that comes in a day of misery occasionally.  And by ""sequential,"" I meant that I basically go in a cycle of Back-Chest-Leg-Back-Chest-Leg etc, 31mins style.  If I am forced to miss 4-5 days, I just pick up where I left off in the cycle - next line in the spreadsheet.    Agree on chips.  It's a weakness.  I guess my punchline is, if you're a 40-something guy with a lot of responsibilities and irregular schedule, don't let the perfect stand in the way of the pretty-damn-good, I've been there and it's an easy excuse and a path to being fat and feeling gross."

leangains,3a6et8,nomadicwonder,2,Wed Jun 17 17:37:58 2015 UTC,Thanks.  And that's a very succinct way to say it.
leangains,3a6et8,cforres,2,Wed Jun 17 17:59:23 2015 UTC,I'm trying to figure out why going from 16.5% to 20% body fat is being lauded as a success.
leangains,3a6et8,foxeroo,2,Thu Jun 18 05:30:57 2015 UTC,"Fair point.  Not looking to be lauded, honestly just offering this up for any other fat, busy guys/parents who might have a hard time adhering to strict Leangains as written, like I did - just a couple of hacks that worked for me.  Also for me, 20% BF (and still declining without much effort) and sustainable is way better than either 30% (which I was at end of 2014) or yoyoing.  Time will tell if it's long term sustainable, I'll report back  I don't look (as much) like a slob with shirt off now - pure vanity.  It's a big mental boost and I know a lot of guys like me who could use one."
leangains,3a8ual,XtraChewy,5,Thu Jun 18 03:35:14 2015 UTC,"Haha, good one! No mofo, you ate didn't you? Do you start your fasting window after you shit out your last meal?   Just eat and lift. Your fast breaks when you eat and stops when you stop eating. Simple and easy."
leangains,3a8ual,simple_mech,3,Thu Jun 18 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, this reminds me of the idea of pregame drinking by taking a shot and then driving to the part or wherever immediately after, thinking that the alcohol won't have time to affect you before you get there."
leangains,3a8ual,yugotprblms,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:20:52 2015 UTC,That is the worst time to workout.  Your body uses a lot of your blood flow and energy in your stomach lining to digest

leangains,3a7gal,simple_mech,5,Wed Jun 17 20:43:25 2015 UTC,"Well since you dropped a lot of weight you need to reassess. I'd slow down the cut to 1-1.2lbs/week if you feel like shit. It'll seriously set you back like 1-2 weeks max but your lifts will go up and you'll feel a hell of a lot better.   Remember it's not a race, it's a marathon."

It's not quite the same but it gets the job done.  For me the fasting also amplifies the effects of caffeine and other stimulants, so I'm doing my best to be mindful and limit myself.  Overall the biggest helper has just been staying busy, but I also find myself chewing more sugar free gum to help fill the void."

leangains,3a7gal,Mevritzs,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:27:14 2015 UTC,Aggressive cut. I did the same thing two years ago. Got down to 153 at a very aggressive deficit. Was never tired or exhausted just not as resilient post workout. My deficit is less aggressive these days am at 173 from 185 last month. But I went from a substantial surplus to a calorie setting that gets me to 160 at about .75 lbs a week.   Maybe increase weekly intake to curb energy deficiency?
leangains,3a7gal,der_brajmang,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:21:14 2015 UTC,Why don't you enjoy yourself by eating a little more and keep your cut at 1 lbs weekly loss? Is it imperative you loose at that rate? That may be just the thing to get your energy back all day. Experiment. It'll of course take longer to loose but you may be happier in the process.
leangains,3a7gal,MrSquat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:41:59 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you experiment with higher carb intakes. I find that helps me get work done during a cut, and I work a somewhat physical job that requires a lot of brain power. I also have stronger coffee cravings with lower carb intakes.  You don't state your current macros or eating window so I'll just assume the standard 12-8 window. If you eat a huge first meal you could be suffering from a post-meal slump from 12-3. If you front-load the vegetables and spread the calories out over 2-3 meals you could get a smoother ride for the start of the feeding window.  That being said... you're gonna feel some negatives from a cut like tonty says. The bigger the deficit the bigger the negatives."
leangains,3a7gal,ehmbie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:05:53 2015 UTC,"Are you eating high-fat low-carb on rest days?  I'm cutting and at first I was ignoring fat intake and eating mostly carbs and protein on rest days and workout days. I felt extremely fatigued for several hours after my workout. I upped the fats and lowered carbs on rest days and it helped a lot. It's important that you're getting enough fat, even tho it's not as satisfying.  Of course you are in a very aggressive deficit so you should expect some fatigue, but it should be manageable. If it's so bad that it makes you miserable, I think you might try losing 1lb a week instead of 1.5 as others have suggested."

You can cut a little bit off workout days as well, just make sure your total weekly calories are in line with how fast you want to cut.   An active lifestyle will help you lose more weight, why would you want to eat more carbs? Where did you come up with the 100g carb thing?"
leangains,3a7xur,simple_mech,0,Wed Jun 17 23:18:13 2015 UTC,Low carb all the way kills me. Cutting down carb ad a means of reducing calories seemed to make sense.
leangains,3a7xur,simple_mech,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:14:39 2015 UTC,"Yea it's up to you. If you really are very very active then you can probably eat at maintenance and still lose weight, but very very active is relative to one's own perception of activity."
leangains,3a7xur,simple_mech,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"Btw just realized, not sure about the program, but you might be doing a ""bodybuilding"" type routine in a deficit which is kind of a waste of time.   Stick to something with high intensity and low volume. You're eating at a deficit so there's no reason to be doing all that volume, you don't have the calories to build the muscle. Follow a strength training program, it's the most efficient way to maintain strength at a deficit.   This has a lot to do with how high of a bf% you are and your experience as well. When I started I was at to do 5x5 and still progress. As time went on I plateaued and realized that it was just too much, way too much actually. I lowered my volume and (surprise surprise!) I started progressing again."
leangains,3a7xur,simple_mech,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"Correct, simply looking at slowly growing as I did a little faster than I'd like bulk for the last seven or so weeks. The idea is to eat a few hundred kcal over maintenance on these training days and around 750 less on the 3 off days  Hoping that makes sense."
leangains,3a7xur,simple_mech,2,Thu Jun 18 06:16:30 2015 UTC,"It does but make sure you're losing weight. If you eat 750 less on rest days and 300 over on workout days you end up with:   750 * 4 = 3000  300 * 3 = 900  So you're only in a 2100 calorie deficit. That's less than 1lb/week which is really slow for fat loss. Depending on your bf%, recommend eating at maintenance on workout days and 750-800 less on rest days, that'll get you closer to 1lb/week. If you have a higher bf% then I'd say keep the rest days like that but eat less on workout days, maybe 200-300 less than maintenance."
leangains,3a7xur,simple_mech,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"Sure. I can back that.  I'll have 3 off days as opposed to the four that a regular RPT setup has, so I'll just use around 1200 a day deficit."
leangains,3a7xur,tontyboy,2,Thu Jun 18 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yes that works but you'll have to eat at maintenance, at most, on workout days, and even then you'll only lose 1lb/week which is the least you should be losing.   What do you hope to accomplish by working out 4 days/week?"
leangains,3a7xur,marshman18,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"Now you have me guessing. I could lose what, 1.5 lbs a week? I got close to 18 to 20% bodyfat and just don't want to lose muscle as I've done rapid diets in the past poorly."
leangains,3a7xur,marshman18,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:51:24 2015 UTC,I'd set the calculator to sedentary or lightly active and eat at maintenance everyday and track your weight and see how much you lose. If you really are that active you'll be losing plenty of weight.
leangains,3a7nar,Dan-TheMan-ish,4,Wed Jun 17 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"I don't get what the problem is? 5am-9pm is 16 hours. Just fast during that time, like you should, and then at 9pm chug a shit ton of water, then have your BCAAs, lift then eat.   I workout after 16-20 hour fasts, it's really not as hard as it sounds. Sometimes you feel drained but usually you'll be in primal mode and just kill it.   Try sleeping through most of the day. Basically just flip flop your day. You're officially a bat for the next 30 days.   Edit: plus it's only 30 days so that's like 12 workouts max. Don't stress it.   Also don't do HIIT, you'll fuck yourself even harder."

That said, /u/simple_mech's advice makes the most sense: this is still a 16 hour fast with an 8 hour window. The only thing changing in this scenario is when your window can open and when it has to close. Make the appropriate adjustments and move on."

How long have you been cutting?  You are in competition mode and I have zero experience with that so I cant provide any significant amount of knowledge on the topic, but I have found that at some point on an extended cut, strength across the board quickly and suddenly stalls if not completely regresses. It seems like you just had a bad day where you were really off (not even being able to lift something off the floor/rack once) - until you realize that the next week and the following week your strength hasnt recovered.  I personally havent quite figured out what its about so ill be following along to see what others input is."
leangains,3a0v6c,divzqt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:18:07 2015 UTC,"As I said, the sudden loss of strength could be a failsafe mechanism of my body considering that my back was mildly injured from previous squat day.  Also to note is that's the only lift that suffered, all other lifts and accessories went up as programmed.  My diet didn't change, protein still quite high, and the day before was a high carb day, that's why I trained fasted, as I thought that even after a night sleep, I would have enough glicogen from the day before to push me through the training.  I really hope is a combination of bad day, injury and fasted training I'm not used to, but I will report back this Saturday when I will attempt the same weight again."

Did you not get as much sleep the night before? Is something stressing you out?  A few things you could try: training less frequently, removing or reducing volume on any lifts that may be compromising your deadlift, or reorganizing your routine by putting lifts that work similar muscles on the same day to ensure a longer recovery.  Before you do anything new, I would try again. It could very well be that you're slightly injured or just weren't mentally there."

The exact opposite scenario. Strange how shit like this works sometimes.
leangains,3a0v6c,EXV,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"In my experience, deadlift form can make a huge difference, bigger than any other lift.  If your leverage was just a little off (standing too far from the bar, bending too much at the knees etc) then you could be way less strong than if your form was ideal."
leangains,3a0v6c,EXV,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"This might not be the case but it's something to consider.  I ran into a similar issue, I was deadlifting 405 as my set one week. Then the next week I couldn't even lift it off the ground, yet I couldn't even pick up 385. I was so pissed and confused. Here's why, The week I picked up 405 was at a gym (closer to work)  and the week I couldn't even lift 385 was at a different older gym with really out dated equip and olympic bars. I noticed the grip on those bars were completely smooth as if sanded down. So, I made some good ol' homemade liquid chalk and tada, my grip improved tremendously and I was back to lifting my norm 405.  Just a possibility, if you're in the same case you might consider it."

Someone on this forum said how he may have lost more muscle than he stated in his birth of leangains cut posts as the numbers were a little off. He no longer advocates such a drastic cut to any of his clients. That should be enough evidence that it may not be the most optimal way of cutting. Only one way to find out, I suppose..."

Cut calories by 800 per day (only protein/fat) and walk 10 miles a day to burn about 800 calories.  Losing about 1.5kg per week and have maintained strength and lean mass (I check with Skulpt aim every day and verified with Dexa).  35"" waist to 30.5"".  Gone from 26.5% body fat to 21.5% body fat in 5 weeks.  I aim to do it for another 2 weeks before slowly introducing more calories and less walking so I can start increasing carbs on workout days and fats on rest days."

Martin mentions brisk walking multiple times on leangains and I've found it's the best way for me to ramp up total calories out.   I'm monitoring using my Skulpt Aim and have found at least at my body fat it is possible to burn 3 - 4lbs a week without any muscle loss.  That will probably change when I am in the 15% range but we'll soon find out."

So far I haven't lost any muscle and strength has gone up every week but I haven't gained any muscle.    My fitness tracker clocks in at about 800 calories per day from walking and I eat 1250 cals per day.  Averaged about 3.3lbs lost per week so tdee is around 3000 cals.  I take caffiene and green tea extract which supposedly amps up fat burning.  I'll keep tracking to see when fat/muscle ratio changes but it's been very consistent for the last 5 weeks.  I don't have muscle muscle anyway so there's that.  Low intensity cardio like walking has worked really well for me."

leangains,39x2qa,mrpigstai,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:45:34 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend it if you are into tracking.  When I tried it for the first time it was telling me 26 - 27% body fat and I couldn't believe it as callipers, tape measurement, scales, body fat machine etc always put me at under 20%.  They offered to pay for me to go for a dexa scan and it was bang on and now I use it every day and I am beginning to understand EXACTLY where the fat is melting away on my body as well as muscle imbalances + areas I need to focus more time on.  Even with this hard cut I will be able to pin point exactly when I need to start reintroducing more calories to minimise lean mass loss.  It does look a bit tacky and sometimes has sync issues or a dodgy reading but overall I'm very happy with it."

Some parts of it are not necessarily bad though, just weird.  I would get real awake right at my normal bed time.  I would have really vivid dreams.  I couldn't always predict what my mood would be like.  The hunger comes in cycles.  If you can drink lots of water, and I did green tea with stevia at times, you can help the hunger.

leangains,39wmms,musclehacking,3,Wed Jun 17 00:51:32 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem when I starting fasting. Through trial and error I found that it was because I was still stuck in the ""small meal"" mindset even though I was only eating in a 6 hour window, ie. I was having mid-sized meals and snacking constantly between meals. This has the same ""issue"" as eating all day in the sense that your hunger hormones are constantly there throughout your eating window.   Solution for me was to make each individual meal larger and have an approximate set time for each meal (at least while I was at home and had the option). ie. big meal at 3pm, 5pm, and 7pm. No snacking in between. Once I got used to that the constant hunger stopped. Lastly, sugar-free gum helps when you get the rare random urge."
leangains,39wmms,simple_mech,3,Mon Jun 15 14:28:41 2015 UTC,"Eat 50% or more of your calories in that first meal. Eat A LOT of fiber from veggies with it. I mean a freakin crap ton of veggies. If your rest day is 1600 calories I'd make the first meal around 1000, over 100g protein, and save 600 for a well planned meal later. Do not snack in between and honestly just stay the fuck out of the kitchen. You can try all the ""tricks"" but in the long term the only thing that's going to work is having some self control."

leangains,39wmms,obbymn,2,Mon Jun 15 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"So let's say im starting the 3 day recommended split from the 31ama, and I'm on deadlift day. So for the first set I put 225 on, and I get 5 reps, easier then I thought it would be. On the second set I remove 10% so it's 202.5 for the second set. But since I did the upper threshold of reps for the first set, do i do 6 reps for the second set? So it's .90 x weight of first set + 1? Since I went over on reps with both sets, what should I increase the weight to next work out? And should I work with the lower threshold of reps. Meaning I pick a weight where I can only get 3 reps before failure, then drop the weight for the second set and get 4? Also I'm confused on what my starting macros should be. Right now I'm 5'11, 172 lbs at 16% BF. Should I use the 0/-875 protocol on LG Macros or the +10/-30 if my goal is fat loss? My ultimate goal is to get down to at least 10% body fat before I try to do a bulk."
leangains,39wmms,musclehacking,0,Mon Jun 15 21:19:01 2015 UTC,"Read the information in 31minutes PDF guide, it'll help answering your questions. Taken from the guide:   There is a structure for RPT: The first set is always within the rep range described (unless you're just starting the routine and went too light. Don't go ""oops, it says to do 6-8 reps, must stop at 8"" if you can do more. If you can do more, do them for that workout, but adjust upward appropriately next week).    ie. in your case if you could do more reps on your first set of 225 just do it - and adjust accordingly for next week (+~10%).   And yes if you hit the upper limit on your first set, ie. you hit 225 x 8, then the next set do 202.5 x 9. Just increase the weight for next week.   You can use either 0/-875 (I take it that's the calorie deficit?) or +10/-30, it depends on personal preference. Some people like the +10% on workout days because they feel they need the extra energy, and same don't. Your overall weekly deficit is what's most important for fat loss, the other stuff is preference.  Have a read of the information in the PDF first then come back with any other questions. 31min's information on training seems like it would help you out."
leangains,39wmms,obbymn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:25:58 2015 UTC,"So if i did a +10 surplus on training days, does that delay my fat loss progress to about .7-1 lb a week?  My overall goal is to be at 9-10% by october.    my macros for the +10/-30 would be 2750 cals on training days and 1750 on rest days."
leangains,39wmms,musclehacking,0,Tue Jun 16 01:10:08 2015 UTC,"So your maintenance is 2500 calories then (2750/1.1)? As opposed to 0/-30 that would be 250 x 3 = 750 extra calories a week, which would delay your fat loss by ~0.2 pounds a week (750/3500).   My recommendation would be to start with 0/-30 and change to +10/-30 when you get deeper into your cut and find you need the extra energy."

leangains,39wmms,lulu297,2,Tue Jun 16 01:31:53 2015 UTC,"So I just had a thorough InBody Scan and these were the results. Female 5 ft 2 in. 95 pounds Body fat: 21.5%  Skeletal muscle mass: 39 pounds Body Fat Mass: 20.3 pounds  BMI: 16.7 BMR: 1094 kcal  The test recommends that I gain 6.8 pounds of body fat and 17.0 pounds of lean body mass.   My trainer then said I should eat 1500 calories everyday. How long should I do this for?  Does this seem like the right plan for me? What should my goal weight be? I'm confused between BMR and TDEE because he added 500 calories to my BMR and not my TDEE. I'm just at a total loss here. I thought TDEE is my maintanance calories. If not, then what would my maintanance number be?  Thanks guys!"
leangains,39wmms,musclehacking,0,Mon Jun 15 22:21:34 2015 UTC,"Your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is an estimate of how many calories you'd burn if you were to do nothing but rest for 24 hours. It represents the minimum amount of energy needed to keep your body functioning, including breathing and keeping your heart beating.  TDEE is the number of calories burnt in a day scaling BMR to level of activity. This is the number of calories you need daily to maintain your current weight.   So yes, your TDEE is your maintenance calories. It seems your training went BMR + 500 (his estimate of your daily calories expended) = TDEE. Tbh he really should of explained to you what he was doing.   You'd do it for as long as it takes to reach your ideal weight. I can't speak on behalf of what your trainer's plan for you was, so you should ask him."
leangains,39wmms,lulu297,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I am sedentary so I'm not sure why he would add 500 as an estimate. Shouldn't my maintanance be a lot lower?

leangains,39wmms,musclehacking,0,Tue Jun 16 02:00:04 2015 UTC,"Well he actually added ~400 calories, not 500. Still an upper estimate for someone who's sedentary but it's all a best guess anyway - everyones caloric needs are different.   1500 is fine for a first guess. Monitor your calories and weight loss closely over the next 2-4 weeks and take note of the changes. This is what will give you a solid idea of your actual maintenance needs.  Stop when you start looking too skinny. Then lean bulk."
leangains,39wmms,lulu297,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm...He's actually trying to get me to gain weight, not lose weight. I'm still confused on what my calorie intake should be."
leangains,39wmms,musclehacking,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"You need to ask your trainer these questions if you want them specific to what he wanted to do - I can't speak for him.   You're over thinking the initial calorie estimate. It's an estimate and your actual maintenance will not be exactly what it's estimated to be. Just eat at 1500 calories and monitor your weight over the next couple of weeks.  Lets say you eat at 1500 calories for a month (~30 days) and your weight increases by 2 pounds (for example). This means that over a month, you consumed 2 (lb) x 3500 calories (the number of calories in a pound of fat) = 7500 calorie surplus.   So, on average that means you ate at a 7500/30 days = 250 calorie surplus a day. So if you were eating 1500 calories a day, your maintenance calories would be around 1500-250 = 1250 calories. That's how you calculate your actual maintenance.   Just make sure you get started on your nutrition & workout plan and don't spin your wheels for too long. Let me know if you have any more questions."

Only so much protein is required for protein synthesis sure but you are't 'wasting' protein' by eating <2 meals a day.  don't munch on 50 grams every 15 minutes, you'll end up more hungry I swear"

It partially helped me get past the 185 flat bench plateau, but mostly from going balls to the walls is what helped the most. My best was 285lbs for 6 reps on decline barbell after I had pyramid up to it with multiple work sets. Although, I was also about 15-20lbs heavier. I have a chest that responds best to overhead presses and front raises to get my upper chest, so back then I had more of the ""gorrilla droop"" because all I did was incline and decline :/ it was also stroking my ego too much when I had trouble benching two plates nomsayin. My goals and priorities prompted me to ditch decline"

leangains,39wmms,simple_mech,3,Mon Jun 15 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"Probably. Why not just have the minimum? Like eat your protein, even higher than usual, and that's it? Just have 220g protein and whatever fats accompany that protein, so like 1000cals that day? Basically your usual rest day but a more severe cut. Honestly how much extra are you cutting out?   Let's say TDEE of 2300. Rest days you eat 1600cals. So that's a 700cal deficit. Eating nothing would put you 2 rest days ahead. So it puts you 1/2 a week ahead of schedule, which is nice, but after a 2 month cut, and doing this every Saturday, you put yourself like 2 weeks ahead. Why not just cut for an extra 2 weeks? Or just an extra week with a bigger deficit on rest days?   It's a week or two difference. Just take that extra insignificant amount of time to cut and keep your lifts moving up. Don't rush it. That's just my personal opinion. Do what you want though."

My main goal for now is fat loss. Might try it for a month and see if it works for me."
leangains,39wmms,simple_mech,2,Mon Jun 15 22:50:52 2015 UTC,Just do -10%/-30% if you want to cut faster.

leangains,39wmms,simple_mech,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:28:36 2015 UTC,Deadlifts tax you more so if they don't then you're not pushing yourself hard enough.   If you want to do a greater deficit then do -40/-10 or -40/-20 so you can create room for more food on workout days. I wouldn't recommend it but it's up to you.

You don't have to eat 2000+ calorie single meals on leangains (tbh, in most cases you wouldn't as you're usually getting at least 2 meals). I usually eat 3 x 400-600 calorie meals or 2 x 800-1000+ calorie meals. The big meals are actually an advantage of leangains - they allow you to enjoy large meals while cutting. You should never be doing the standard bulk on a leangains protocol (ie. not a ""lean bulk"") so the big meals only serve as an advantage (keep you full).   If you're having trouble with the big meal sizes then go for 3 meals. I think you're just getting psyched out by the belt sander's meals and thinking that you'll have to eat that much in one go - you don't have to. The belt sander just likes bigger meals is all."

leangains,39wmms,musclehacking,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:22:40 2015 UTC,When would you prefer to have your eating window - in the morning or in the evening? You should base when you eat off of your own personal preference.   And yes it's perfectly fine to break the fast without a workout (you do that all the time on rest days). Martin simply recommends getting at least 60% of your calories post-workout. Have a read of the leangains guide to get a look / understanding of some different protocols.

Think of it this way, the scale is an extremely useful tool for losing weight, but ultimately all you need to know is one days figure compared to the last.  The actual weight that you are, or will be, is completely arbitrary.    The trouble is ""goal weight"" is such a completely ubiquitous term, but the real term should be goal physique.    No one would choose actually being a specific weight over having their goal physique.  To give you an example, I currently weigh about 30lbs more than my lowest ever weight and I look a million times better.  At the same time I am only 20lbs under my original fat ass starting weight.  If you'd asked me at the beginning if I wanted to be 160lb or 190lb I would have gone for the former."

How accurate is the scale?  And then the last point is that maybe your starting body fat number is lower than what you actually were at.

leangains,39rbkt,crblanz,10,Sun Jun 14 00:13:51 2015 UTC,"You can cook meat in a rice cooker similar to how you would in a regular slow cooker but you just might need to keep an eye on it instead of setting and forgetting.   Some grocery stores will throw rotisserie chickens on sale later in the day so see if that's something you can take advantage of.  If not, they're still pretty reasonably priced and will last in the fridge for at least few days. If you aren't lactose intolerant stock up on things like greek yogurt and cottage cheese to help with protein intake. If you have $30-$50 to spare you can buy a decent griddle that serves as a cooktop for pretty much anything you can think of.   Basically, the list can go on and on so there's really no reason not to hit your macros."

It doesn't matter which rep range you use. As long as you can progressively add weight then you will be gaining in strength and size (if you are eating enough calories).   Alternatively, you can attach a known weight to each dumbbell. U-bolts are relatively cheap and easy to attach to the handle. They can also be used for barbells."

All I'll say on the topic is that if lifting in the morning makes it easier for you to get in enough food, that's what you should do.

It's not easy, especially when I don't really get hungry.  This is what I did. Find the lowest calorie, highest protein foods and start trying those.  Just snack all day instead of eating giant meals.  If you're like me and don't get hungry or think to eat, just schedule mini-meal times (breakfast, midmorning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, post-workout drink, etc.).  That way you're not trying to cram all your protein in at once and your body gets used to eating more often. Try this: mix one of those individual low calorie Greek yogurt (any flavor) with a cup of plain, 0% fat Greek yogurt.  Add in some chia seeds if you like them.  It makes a giant bowl of yogurt and about 240 cal/35 protein.  Have a breakfast protein shake (whey+some almond milk & oj...about 200cal/25pr).  4oz. of fresh deli chicken (120 cal/25 pr).

leangains,39mmj5,kad123,13,Fri Jun 12 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"Hi u/kad123, I am the creator of LGMacros and I will try to answer your questions.   How could the site suggest I consume a MINIMUM fat content of 79g with IIFYM and then suggest only 45g/62g for fixed standard diet?   Simple, each calculator is independent to its own Leangains methodology. The standard macro calculator follows the 75/25 carb, fat split and vice versa. The IIFYM calculator follows the scientific minimum fat intake required to achieve optimal hormonal balance (0.45g/lbs). It also follows the scientific 0.82g/lb protein intake to preserve and build lean mass (even on a caloric deficit).  Keep in mind that all of these calculators are used as a starting point. When I created LGmacros I wanted something that would be extremely easy to use. Plug in your weight and you are good to go. From there on, it’s up to you to track and adjust accordingly.  If you are a fan of IIFYM then follow it! Aim for 79g of fat and 145g of protein every day. If you go over…go over! If you go under, go under.  Example:   108g of fat 157g protein rest carbs   or   65g fat 200g protein    From there on, track your mood. If you start noticing a consistent reduction in sex drive or a drop in mood, increase your fats. If you’re feeling a consistent drop in recovery, increase your protein. The whole point of IIFYM is to have an extremely flexible target. It shouldn't be a struggle to reach a specific macro. If you find that 79g of fat is too low, then bump it up. If you feel like 145g of protein is too hard to achieve, reduce it! Then follow your mood and strength and adjust accordingly. IIFYM should not feel like dieting.  Let me know if you have any other questions. These calculators are just a starting point, they are not set in stone."

I made the crumb from butter, oats and flour, wasn't the best actually, but any biscuit works i guess. For the filling I beat 500 g lowfat cream cheese, then added sucralose, vanilla, then about 500 g lowfat greek yoghurt then 3 eggs one by one. The water bath is really important, I made a cake two weeks ago without it, and it's surface was cracked and creased. For the topping i used strawberries cause they are the best berries. (next after blueberries but they are too expensive for me :). Oh and I used a 9"" springform pan, 1,5 hours on 180 C, then 1 hours letting it cool.  Basically use that recipe, just substite stuff with lowfat and sweeteners, despite the author's warning against lowfat stuff."

leangains,39l6nq,EJLG,3,Fri Jun 12 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"Please note that this is not my recipe. All credit goes to http://theproteinchef.co/  That being said, here is the recipe:   1.25lbs chicken breast 1/8 cup zero fat Italian dressing 85g BBQ sauce (I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and brown sugar) 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar (with the mother) 1/4 chopped sweet onion Crushed red pepper to taste (I used about 2 tsp)   Put everything in a slow cooker (mine was too big, so I put the stone bowl from the picture into my slow cooker and it worked just fine), mix it up, put on high heat for 3 hours, after that, shred with 2 forks, cook on high heat for another hour, done.   Some things that might be useful to note: I mixed it all up last night in a separate bowl (so the rapid change in temp wouldn't crack the bowl), then I woke up 3 hours early to start it, went back to bed, got up again, pulled it, went to the gym, and made me sweet potato fries in the remaining few minutes that I let the chicken cook. Also, buns were 80 calories each, high in fiber, and like 6g protein per.   Edit: Thanks!"

It always gives me a noticeable boost in mood and energy. Yohimbine makes my heart pound when I weight train and I didn't notice a huge difference in leanness but that could be cause I wasn't lean enough when taking it.
leangains,39kp1n,tanngrisni,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:27:53 2015 UTC,"My understanding was I could do both, and that preference was to take yohimbine during a fasted state.

leangains,39kp1n,Peckerdick,4,Fri Jun 12 13:34:22 2015 UTC,"This is more than just my weekly progress, but I figured I would share my overall progress here. I've been doing IF for maybe 5 months, and LG for 3. In January I was 185lbs @ ~25-30% body fat, and as of last night I was 170lbs @ 14% BF. My squat went from 95 to 225 @ 3 reps. Bench went from 65 to 185. I'm not sporting very amazing numbers, but these are far more than I've ever lifted before in my life, and I'm more than happy with my progress as an older dude with a really bad ankle, elbow and knee!  I try to share my progress to show that LG works even for people who are overweight and just starting out. I simply can't eat like a pig in the 8-hour feeding window. It's sometimes a struggle to get enough calories, which is a good thing since my primary goal has been to lose fat.  I'm 33 now, and in the absolute best shape of my life. Even in my early 20's when I was unemployed and working out 6 days a week while spending an hour a day on preparing 5-6 perfectly balanced meals, I didn't make this much progress this quickly. Preparing meals is a breeze now, I spend less than half as much time in the gym as I used to, I'm more than a decade older than I was then, and I'm still making significantly better progress. That's a testament to LG if you ask me. This shit has changed my life!  I started out with doing body recomp (+20/-20) and got most of my early results due to noob gains. I switched to cut (-30/+10) and will probably switch back to recomp when I hit 10-12%bf."

I'm about 5'5"" (164cm) and have weighed up to 220lb at one point, started my latest cut at about 177lb 6 weeks ago, currently at 170lb as of this week. Aiming for 145lb ballpark, we'll see (not fussed over the number, going for how I look/feel/lift).  Started barely able to bench the bar, currently capable of 110lb x 8. Could only do unweighted squat 6 weeks ago (and not get my arms in position to hold a bar) currently able to do 132lb x 8 properly.

I used to be close to 210-220 a couple years back, then sort of hung around in a skinny-fat thing for a while. How did you get from 220 from 177? IF or something else?  The weight lifting community as a whole, more people are in their 20's from what I can tell. LG seems to be more of a mature community though. Perhaps because it's more of an advanced technique that people later in their weight training careers should be doing. I don't consider myself old at 33, but many people do. I've spoken to young guys and they say shit like ""Dude you're ripped, it's great that you're still working out!"" (implied that this sentence should finish with ""at your advanced age"").  Fuck it though, maybe it's just perception, but I feel far better at the age of 33 then I did at 18.

In my experience with RPT, I've always found the final rep of the back off set to require a very similar effort to the final rep of the top set.

If you are in kcal deficiency all days and if you get spinning head after heavy sets, would explain why - running low on glucose. Try to snack on gummy bears between sets. I always have high sugar bar in a pocket for squats/deads days. Of course not using all the time, but as a backup. For example last friday I ate it, I could feel I'm weak and have no power after 1st set, ate it - different ball game instantly. Better to add this kcal for good WO, then take a step back on RMs due kcal deficiency :)  EDIT: Realisted did not really answer your question :) Yes, I do get the same, especially for exercises which involves heavy weights: squots/deads. But I only get this while under eat carbs or not enought sleep (rest), hence my sugar bar backup."

leangains,39g2ks,Tall_LA_Bull,4,Thu Jun 11 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'm about your same size--6'5"", 190 lbs. I'm at about 10% BF, so it's not exactly the same, but I'm right at the end of my cut (about a month to go, 2-3 more lbs), and I have a few thoughts for you:  1) You're definitely, DEFINITELY not at your max lifts ""on a cut"". You've reached a mental plateau. Those happen, I've been through several. Get yourself mentally right, and your lifts will suddenly, magically start going up again.  2) Squats are tough on guys our height. That's just the way it is. Stretch your hamstrings like hell, make sure you're getting to parallel, but going ass-to-grass is a tall order (pun intended). I'm still keeping my squats artificially low (135 @ 5x5 for now) in order to work on flexibility, because I experienced low back pain when I went up to 225 before. I wouldn't sweat it if that lift stays low for a while. I might even back off the weight a little bit and really work on form. When you get to higher weights, putting in the work on form at low weight will make a big difference.  3) I would consider switching to a standard Stronglifts 5x5 program, where you squat 3x a week but switch off the other two big lifts and do some accessories. I started with a Big 3 program, but found that I got fatigued doing all 3 3x a week. I also think doing other compound lifts is very beneficial overall to building strength.  4) You need to be attempting to progress faster. Adding 5 lbs ""every couple of weeks"" is bullshit. If you make 5x5 at a weight, go up in weight the next workout, and keep doing it until you fail. Finish out your sets, and try it at the SAME WEIGHT (don't go back down) the next workout. If you fail 3 times in a row, back off 10% and start progressing again. Waiting until you ""feel comfortable"" is inhibiting you.  5) Your squat and bench aren't bad, but your DL is lagging way behind. Why are you doing Sumo DL? Why not regular? I'd say start focusing on getting that weight up. DL should be your heaviest lift, not your lightest.  6) I'm a little confused by your description of your diet progress. You said you lost 7 lb since you began, but then later you say you lost 10% of bodyfat. Those two numbers don't add up to me. 7 lb does not equal 10%, when you're our height/weight. This is ESPECIALLY true if you started at 26%, which is what your numbers indicate you did. Want to try that again?  7) What are your macros like? Are you getting 190+ g of protein a day? At our size (any size, really), that's absolutely crucial to muscle retention and good body composition. Cheating that number is a huge no-no."
leangains,39g2ks,WaylandC,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:09:21 2015 UTC,"Thorough reply, thanks.  2) This is nice to hear. I don't attempt a2g, just below parallel. I always thought the issue with my squat form was two things: it's hard to keep my lower back from rounding when I'm bending at the waist, and I always want to shift the weight forward onto my toes, making it hard to sit back into it. Maybe it's weak hamstrings that's causing me to shift the weight forward? I can post a form video if you'd take a look at it. I think I'm going to do a few sets at 185 today and see if I can really focus on activating the hammys.  3) I'll consider this. I think for sure the squats and DL 5x5 every workout are more than I can recover from on the cut.  4) Point taken, I could be pushing myself harder.  5) DL is my highest at 235. As many times as I've tried, I cannot seem to get the form down on normal DL, my lower back always rounds, without rounding the back I cant reach the ground to set the bar down, another issue of tight hamstrings maybe? However the sumo DL (artificially shortening the legs I think) lets me stay nice and tight in the lower back, it feels very controlled. Do you think I should keep trying on the normal DL form?  6) Is it possible that I've gained some lean mass and lost some fat? My starting and current BF% are just estimates based on examples from google images. I estimate I was around 25-30% when I started, and 16-18% now, but the scale has only moved 7 lbs. But I could be wrong on the BF%.  7) I get at least 150g protein, I'd say I average about 175g. You think the extra 15g are worth changing things up a little in my diet?"
leangains,39g2ks,soci4ldrinkr,0,Fri Jun 12 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"1) Your form issues are definitely a tight hamstrings issue. I have the same problem. I'd recommend you start a serious stretching program. It's not as fun as lifting, but it's every bit as important.  2) If you're making progress, the actual BF and scale numbers aren't that important. Just keep making progress. It sounds like you have a realistic understanding of the relationship between the two numbers, and that's a good thing.  3) I think eating 1g protein/lb is absolutely crucial to muscle development and retention. Yeah, 15g isn't that much difference, but over time, that adds up a lot. I'd shoot for 200g a day. This will also keep you fuller during the cut. It's the most important macro number, by far.  Good luck!"

You could be cutting too hard if you feel fatigued throughout the days even when it's not a lifting day.   That doesn't really matter though because you're pretty weak man. If you feel shitty, up your carbs a little bit. Not too much so that you start gaining all your weight back, but experiment by adding a little bit at a time until you feel good.   The only reason I'm telling you to do that is because of the yoga 4/5 times a week. I do that as well and it affects my dieting process every time. You're not strong enough to actually need to focus on bulking and cutting for a little while. That's not an excuse to get fat and eat whatever. Just eat enough to consistently get stronger and not feel like shit."

You will only see dramatic improvement on this program through high strength development. If I were you, I'd drop 5x5 or whatever. To me it's a waste of time.  As tonty says, why lift at a suboptimal level 5 times when you can just do it once at you max? It just doesn't make sense."

If you don't want to lose strength, do a bulk and then cut.   Otherwise, stay the course and you won't lose as much as quickly or gain strength as quickly, but you'll continue to drop fat and gain strength.

Cut some protein and make up the difference in carbs for a couple of cycles, both for bulking because it will up your energy, and to a lesser extent for cutting to keep your body from breaking down muscle tissue for fuel.   Obviously it depends on your approach, whether the fat or the strength is your priority, or if you're happy with the LG mixed cycle. Either way you should skew a little towards carbs especially before and after your workout.   People here have this mantra of protein good carbs bad but there's more to it than that."

There is no reason why he should need more carbs in order to gain strength.     A more likely explanation is that the volume of a 5X5 is too much for him to recover from in a caloric deficit and the accumulated fatigue from lack of recovery has resulted in a platueu. The solution is cutting volume, not protein.     Something like a 10% deload plus 2x5 worksets or RPT on the stalled exercises would be more ideal for him."

But since you asked...  i had a couple weeks where each weekend had a concert so I'll share what worked for me:  Both concerts fell on a rest day, shooting for roughly 1700 calories.  For lunch I'd try getting as much good food in me as possible without going over 1000-1200 calories or so.  That'd basically be the last time i'd eat food until  the next day when I broke fast.  Alcohol makes you crave the foods you want to avoid so thats the toughest part no doubt.  The odds are against you too.  Also getting through the hangover in a fasted state is tougher.  Powerade Zero, water, coffee and advil are your friend.    I don't have sources but could probably find them where I once read them if interested.  If you want to split that up and eat a bit before going out to avoid drinking on an empty stomach that might work.  For me it came down to saying no to the bar food.  I still drank into wee hours of the night.  Basically the 31minutes AMA alcohol guide worked for me.

leangains,39g5gd,simple_mech,3,Thu Jun 11 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"Good article.  But I have one question about what was said in the conclusion.  It basically boiled down to keeping the effort high on each set and keeping the number of sets high.  But what is a high number of sets?  3, 4, 5, 10?  I see most programs tend to call for 3-4 sets, or 1-2 sets across multiple exercises that hit the same/similar muscles, for instance: 2 sets Flat Bench, 2 sets Incline DB Bench, 2 sets Flys.  At what point does the number of sets become high enough for maximal muscle growth?  For OP, it seems pretty apparent that 31min's routine has very low volume, but very high effort.  If I had to guess I'd wager that adding an extra set or two (RPT style) to each exercise is probably good for adding mass.  I'd also probably switch things up to work each muscle group twice a week, like an upper/lower split 2xWeek."
leangains,39g5gd,Chilling_Music,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:07:01 2015 UTC,"Good point. The basis of my reply was to show him that the typical way of thinking of volume (repsxsetsxweight) is not as important as just pushing yourself, which is the main factor for causing growth. I believe the number of sets is heavily dependent on how hard you push yourself.   If you are training RPT style and are pushing yourself to the limit then you shouldn't be able to do more than 2-3 sets. If he wants more volume then he should follow the standard 3 set RPT."
leangains,39g5gd,simple_mech,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:43:48 2015 UTC,"It basically boiled down to keeping the effort high on each set and keeping the number of sets high. But what is a high number of sets? 3, 4, 5, 10?   5s are usually a good indicator of, ""it's time to increase the weight""  From the article:   Keep effort high, keep number of sets high, and tailor your rep ranges to your goals or whatever keeps you motivated, and progress shouldn’t be a problem.  Strength increases are highly specific to the rep ranges used. If you want to get better at one-rep max attempts, you need to lift loads that are close to that. If you want to get better at high reps, you need to lift lighter loads.   One key thing that most newbies seem to misunderstand; when they mention lighter loads they mean light in comparison to your 1RM.  Formula for strength according to the article   Choose a rep range Pick a weight that is challenging at that rep range Do multiple sets with it   I think this is why Andy started to recommend 5x5 over RPT.  A great way of doing the above is work up in sets of 5 (also known as RAMPED sets) until the weight feels heavy that you have about 1 rep left in the tank. This is your TARGET WEIGHT for the day. It's a great tool for auto-regulating the volume in your workout. Don't pre-plan sets anymore. Repeat sets of 5 with that weight until you don't have any more reps left in the tank.  Example   Warm-up sets 225 x 5 - fairly easy 245 x 5 - at least 2 reps in the tank 265 x 5 - maybe 2 reps in the tank...so repeat 265 x 5 - 2 reps in the tank for sure 275 x 5 - maybe 1 rep in the tank 275 x 5 - last rep was a grind, definitely no reps left without breaking down form and risking injury   The above averages out to be ~260lbs for 6 sets of 5, and if you don't count the easy opener of 225, then the average comes out to 265 x 5 x 5. That is how strong you were for that specific day. If you were hung over the night before, that number may have been lower. If you had a great sleep and crushed a buffet the night before that number will probably be higher. You do what you can for each day. This will eliminate horrendous training sessions that consist of grinding the weight, fatiguing you further into regression and it will prevent injury. Give it a shot...  You'll be surprised at how well this works."

It's rewarding. Maybe try this lifting program http://stronglifts.com/5x5/ in combination with intermittent fasting if you have a tendency to overeat. I just reccommend it because it's the program I started with and it's worked really well for me. I've since tweaked its routine for what I need to work on.  i'm 5'7"" 149lbs and i started at 192 lbs on Jan 1st. didn't start doing leangains protocol til end of February.. i've lost 40+ lbs of fat and increased all my lifts using a combination of 5x5 and RPT for my lifts that are more advanced. Doesn't really matter which lifting program you do so long as you stick to it for monthssss.   three most important things:  1) eat healthy food, lots of protein - consider calorie/macro tracking  eat less cals than you expend and you will lose weight, eat more and you will gain  2) lift HARD, push yourself every workout  3) rest"

leangains,39d0lm,simple_mech,2,Thu Jun 11 03:21:47 2015 UTC,Yea I'd really like those to be visible. What would you say I should aim for for the surplus if I want to bulk like you said?

leangains,39d0lm,joeeeeee_,2,Thu Jun 11 15:29:27 2015 UTC,Ok so I guess you don't really enjoy fasting.   How do you feel about your low cal days? Like? Dislike?
leangains,39d0lm,cdmn,2,Thu Jun 11 17:16:29 2015 UTC,I don't love the fasting but I do like getting to eat large meals at the end of a fast. At this point my days are fasting until 2pm then a small meal at work and a big meal post workout when I get home. The low days are okay. Usually use protein fluff to help myself feel full.
leangains,39d0lm,bladetips,2,Fri Jun 12 01:39:59 2015 UTC,"Ok I was just trying to gauge how extreme you'd like it to be. If you like to eat large meals then eat ~3100-3200 on workout days and ~1850 on test days.   Current TDEE is 2300 * 7 = 16,100 weekly   3150 * 3 = 9,450  1850 * 4 = 7,400  9450 + 7400 = 16,850   That means you'll be eating 750 calories extra per week.   To do this slowly increase calories until you get to about +20/-20% and eat that for a week or two. You can be lenient on the 4th rest day since there's more rest days than workout days. I'd recommend eating at or close to maintenance that day. Then slowly increase calories until you get to my recommendation. Good luck."
leangains,39d0lm,jpdonelurkin,4,Fri Jun 12 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"Since the majority is saying bulk, I feel like maybe I'll offer a slightly different opinion.    Even though its hardly ever recommended, I think you may be one of the very few that could recomp.    You are already lean, but strength is only average.  A bulk is needed, but I bet you could still increase gains for a while eating at the slight deficit a recomp provides.  This should keep you lean, if not maybe cut a little more fat while you increase strength for a short while.  If you do try this, just be sure to give it a try about double the time of a cut since the recomp protocol is much slower, and keep hitting the gym hard.  Otherwise, like the others said.  Bulk"
leangains,39d0lm,jpdonelurkin,2,Thu Jun 11 12:47:46 2015 UTC,So would you recommend trying a -20/+20 for the recomp? How much time do you think I should try it for? As long as I'm seeing progression?
leangains,39d0lm,Powderbones,2,Thu Jun 11 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"thats a good place to start.  if you train 3x a week, that's an average daily deficit of only 3% (assuming you have your TDEE nailed down).    I'd run this for no shorter than 16 weeks personally before i'd reevaluate.  and if at that point you are still trending in the right direction per your goal, i'd keep it going until progress dies.  But the key here with this advanced style diet, is to understand progress will be microscopic at times and to not get discouraged by the speed.  you will really want to look at larger data sets for body weight and lift numbers averaged out to see the trends at times."

leangains,39c3og,blindpet,17,Wed Jun 10 20:13:10 2015 UTC,You're confusing fruit juice with fruit smoothie. Fruit smoothie you're eating the pulp aswell. Fruit juice is literally just the juice that comes out - totally different composition and calorie count.

Anything over that limit will spillover to fat and any prolong spillover is directly correlated to type 2 diabetes...but in all honesty, in order to get to those levels you would have to go out of your way to consume that amount.   You would have to eat 500g of pineapple (roughly 3 cups worth in chunks) and anywhere from 5-8 medium bananas. This is assuming you don't ingest any other fructose for the day. 3 cups of pineapple and 5-8 bananas are very difficult to eat but extremely easy to drink.

Likely it's better to keep those to after your workout, and to keep the rest of them in the lower GI, higher nutrition, higher fiber carb bank (oatmeal, sweet potatoes, squash, other veggies/fruits). If you wanted to get more carbs in, just drink gatorade or chocolate milk post workout. Gets you a low cost dextrose, high GI carb that doesn't shuffle completely to your liver.

leangains,39c3og,oooopppss,3,Thu Jun 11 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"Because it gets boring pretty quick. Nevermind the fructose — fructose content in fruit and 100% juices is laughable at best; you'd have to chug gallons before hurting yourself.  But, let's be clear here:   fruit juice is not pure sugar. ""Pure sugar"" aka table sugar is made of sucrose, which is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose in almost equal parts; which brings us to... white rice is not pure sugar either. Rice carbohydrate content (80%) is completely made of starch, which is basically glucose. glycemic indexes literally count for nothing. This has been known for ages now. You might want to look at glycemic load values. If you suffer from diabetes, that is. If you don't, you shouldn't care at all about glycemic values. Yes, fruit juice is pure carbs, but it's pretty inefficient at that. You're looking at about 10 grams of carbohydrates in 100ml of juice. That means you'd have to chug down 3 litres of that to reach your 300 daily grams. Which is boring, won't satiate you and doesn't come cheap   My thoughts on the matter are that ""up to 400g"" is not a ""massive amount of carbs"" by any stretch of the imagination. If you train seriously, that is. You should just learn how to eat instead of finding a sub-par shortcut to your means. Yeah, shortcuts are bad when cutting and when bulking, or maintaining.

Real scientific data does not support that this substance mobilizes adipose (fatty) tissue (directly anyway).  It was used by European lifters many years ago.    I was supplementing with this type of plant sterol back in he early 80's.  If cutting is what you're looking for, try conjugated linoleum acid.  It may work for you and it may not.  But its purpose is for fat mobilization.    L-Carnitine's purpose is for fat mobilization.    Yohimine's purpose is to enhance the body's natural T level through the luteinizing hormonal apparatus.

leangains,39bjmx,KaleoE,3,Thu Jun 25 04:54:31 2015 UTC,"Why would you take it on a bulk? Read Martin's article on Yohimbine again.  Yohimbine is an alpha-2 receptor antagonist... Martin describes the receptors as locked door to a room of full fat cells and Yohimbine as the key (not the only key, just one of them) to unlock the door (so that you can access the fats and use/burn them). When you're in a caloric surplus, your body will never even knock on those doors. You're planning on taking it on training days/high carbs day, days where you eat at a surplus, days where your body is flooded with high amounts of insulin that prevents fat oxidation. So how is Yohimbine going to work for you? You body will not be in a right metabolic state to tap those stored energy even if the ""doors are unlocked"".  Also you said your workouts are intense, so your heart rate is already high, and you want to pump up your blood pressure by taking Yohimbine? Totally counter-productive to whatever you are trying to achieve.  EDIT: I guess you could take it on rest days if you are eating at a deficit on those days.

leangains,399xhh,Georofl,14,Wed Jun 10 08:46:24 2015 UTC,"The difference between the before and after is not just the weight. There is a big difference in the angle, the lighting, the flexing-status, and such. In the before, notice that he has lines going up from his pants which aren't that different between pictures - this indicates that in the before he is considerably leaner than it looks. His waist-shoulder line is not really that different either.  This could just as easily be one of those ""faked before/afters"", at least the difference between the two is exaggerated by quite a bit.   But if I go ahead and crunch some numbers this is what comes out:  He states his tdee to be around 3000kcal, but it would probably be closer to 2300. He says he aims for 2000kcal but often undershoots. He eats 680kcal from protein per day which doesn't leave much room for much of anything else.  He trains every day, weights 3x and p90x the other days. So he's putting in around 80min of ab-work per week.  His glycogen depletion alone would be probably a third of his 30lbs deficit meaning only about 20lbs of true weight loss. If he takes the before weight in the evening and the after weight in the morning, that could be about 4lbs difference, so we're down to about 16lbs of true weight loss. Assuming he was 20% bodyfat in the ""before"" it gives about 33lbs of fat-mass, for a maximum deficit of ~1000kcal / day. The 9% ""after"" at 140lbs gives about 390kcal / day. So he could have eaten about 1600 kcal / day steadily throughout without exceeding his limit for a total of ~13lbs. If he undershoots more in the beginning than in the end, that can bump the numbers a bit upwards. Coupled with his ""newbie gains"" he might have kept most of his muscle (which isn't much muscle).   So yeah, it's a good 90 day cut for sure, but not nearly as good as these pictures and numbers would have you believe.

leangains,3940r6,LeanGainsRoxas,6,Tue Jun 9 02:37:09 2015 UTC,I honestly dont do cardio at all. Back when i was at a caloric deficit while fasting i shredded off tons of fat with no cardio at all.   If youre looking to cut then i guess theres nothing wrong with cardio and lifting on the same day.   Edit: Grammar
leangains,3940r6,dennislang,8,Tue Jun 9 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"I just enjoy running and am working on my 5k time, it's more for the sake of the sport rather than adding deficit."
leangains,3940r6,LeanGainsRoxas,3,Tue Jun 9 02:48:39 2015 UTC,"If you're into running, keep it up.  Otherwise, I feel any cardio done on a deficit should require little to no recovery, e.g: an hour of fasted walking. Anything that requires repair will compete with your resistance training for resources. Sure, you might be able to get away with both but it's an unnecessary risk."

I've always told myself I'm either going to reach my goal or I'm going to die trying....I've done it all. Cut calories: check. Spend more calories than consume: check. intermittent fast: check. Paleo and keto: check. I don't know why but my last few pounds are really hard to budge. I was 250 lbs at almost 30% body fat and now I'm 192. I eat at a caloric deficit of 500-700 calories.

If you've reached a plateau with the above info I could only suggest 30min fasted LISS throughout the week or 2-3 weeks at maintenance. One of the issues with pausing a cut at maintenance is seeing some weight bounce back due to water retention, then questioning it and going back to deficit. It works well though, and keto might help with the water weight, good luck!"

leangains,3940r6,bms88,4,Wed Jun 10 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as ""wrong"", there's only what your body responds to. I do tons of cardio because I like doing cardio. I do it on workout days, on rest days, all hours, etc. My body is used to doing it and I feel great, it doesn't hurt my lifts, etc. Not everybody is like that.  Stop worrying about the details of ""the system"" and start worrying about what works for YOU."
leangains,3940r6,bms88,2,Tue Jun 9 09:09:38 2015 UTC,"What is cardio anyway?  A way of increasing your TDEE slightly by drastically increasing your energy output in a short time frame.  The result is better conditioning, more ""energy"" and less lethargy.  All you need to do is eat enough to ensure this activity doesn't hamper your weight training.  There really isn't much difference between jogging for 30 minutes and sitting all day vs. working on your feet and not doing cardio.  There is no pressing need to avoid cardio, it's just that leangains demonstrates that you can get shredded without doing any of it."
leangains,3940r6,WillTurnerDed4UrSins,2,Tue Jun 9 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"If it suits your lifestyle and you are eating enough to compensate for the extra cardio workout, then why not."

leangains,3940r6,inb4newfags,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:11:22 2015 UTC,Depends on your goals. If you want to get bigger and stronger cardio is working against you. If you want to be in an extreme deficit cardio helps with that.   Overall though since the main theme of Leangains is to get stronger while remaining shredded rest is an absolutely huge part of getting stronger and you aren't getting enough rest. Assuming you are lifting at 100% intensity at 80% of your 1RM in an RPT style as the protocol recommends then that additional cardio is certainly over training which could result in injury. If you aren't training in the gym very hard then it probably won't hurt you.   To each their own and again it depends on your overall goals.

leangains,392bfj,photopat,3,Mon Jun 8 19:10:10 2015 UTC,My suggestions: move squats to A; use dips as main chest ex (maybe rpt) and inclined DB as secondary; move ohp to B (you can't push a lot after two chest/shoulder ex); do chins (weighted when you can) before rows (or move rows to A); then add some shrugs to B and calf raises to A

The primary muscles that might need additional stimulation in this program would be your lateral delts, upper traps, and possibly your glutes/hammies (depending on your biomechanics).   I'd consider replacing the tricep dips with upright rows, shrugs or high pulls, with high pulls being an option that hits the lateral delts and traps."

leangains,38xw1v,whilst7,3,Sun Jun 7 19:52:11 2015 UTC,"The others can give / are giving better advice on lifting and working out. I want to say something about diet:   I’ve tried the regular healthy 1200 calories diet and managed to be hungry all the time and lose 15kg/33, but I didn’t got the results I wanted.   1200 may be too low for you. But, you also need to give calorie changes time to sink in. You'll be hungry for a few weeks and then you'll get used to it. Any diet change is like this -- it'd be just as uncomfortable for you if you had to add 1200 calories to what you're already eating. On top of that you're getting stressed over a keto diet, which is another change you'll need time to adjust to.  I had a hard time switching from 3 meals to 2 meals, but after a few weeks I began to like it a lot. And now I still do."
leangains,38xw1v,gluontunes,2,Mon Jun 8 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"I think this is some very sound advice.  In the end, changing diet is nearly always difficult, but you should always give your body time to adjust before deciding that something isn't right for you.  The number of people who have poo-poo'ed me for not eating breakfast is staggering, but the vast majority don't do it because they start to lack energy before lunch.  Your body is great at adjusting - just give it time."

First day of training I did deadlifts, squats, OHP, bench press, and rows via the startingstrength.com program  Best decision I have ever made. I think they are right that if you go straight into the power lifts on a 1200 calorie diet its going to feel super hard and you aren't going to comply. If I were you I would up the calories a bit, get accustomed to these 5 lifts, and then start caloric restriction. Even without weight loss your body will tone and you will be happier with your appearance in as little as two months.  Again, also female, take it from me, lift heavy.  Also about looking like a man, such a fucking lie, you'd have to do some 'roids to have that happen.

That's not a shot at you, just emphasizing the point that health is systemic and there are no body-part specific differences in training.  -Keto is a huge pain in the ass for whatever benefits it has imo.   -Maintenance figure is way too high, over 1/3rd of your cells are fat and they don't burn nearly as much per day. 1900 is probably a lot closer to reality.   -Hours and hours of inane cardio followed by half-assed machine workouts is why women make such little progress. C25k is plenty of cardio by itself. The rest of your focus should be intense weightlifting. The purists will disagree but I don't think you actually need much if any barbell training to reach your goals. Lat pulldowns (then weighted chinups once you can), bent over rows, leg press, dumbbell benchpress, dumbbell shoulder press, is basically all you need. You can transition to deadlifts, squats, bench press after building some general strength and comfort. I would argue that jumping into these directly is going to be discouraging and reduce likelihood of compliance with your program."

Essential staples of the keto diet are not usual or local to Portugal, like bacon or avocados, I had no problem with the bacon but avocados are kind of gross. ):  By the way... the mediterranean diet is not what those studies you heard about refer too, we eat a lot of meat.

First of all, if you gonna use a calculator, use the sedentary option. My height is 175 and my TDEE is between 2300-2500 as a male, I think yours are actually lower. Second of all, 1200 kcal every day seems awfully low, no wonder you have a hard time with it. Here in leangains, we do calorie and carb cycling, where one eats more carbs and calories on workout days, and more fat/less carbs and kcals on rest days. And we arrived to the most important part, lifting. Workout days mean heavy ass lifting, this should mean a programme focusing on heavy compound lifts (deadlifts, squats, bench press, dips, chinups) with progressive overload, meaning the weight moved or reps should increase every session. You seem to be on the right path. You are not afraid of lifting, and you know it won't make you bulky. Picking up (deadlifting) your bodyweight is a good goal, and easily surpassable once you are in the business. P.S.: Somebody should teach you these movements or learn them from vids, or Starting Strength."

Carbs are usually consumed post workout, to help regenerating your destroyed muscle fibers. On the sidebar you can find a lot of information, I'd start with 31minutes AMA and the actual leangains site. 31minutes' workoutplan is actually pretty solid, but as a beginner lifter I don't know how would you start with it, I started out with a 3x5 linear progression program."
leangains,38xw1v,GothicToast,2,Mon Jun 8 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"The only advice I can give is to:   walk less as you are doing the Couch 2 5k program but don't worry too much (5k in the end is not that much cardio once you get proficient) obviously get familiar with compound movements even if it is just the bar but for near term workouts do kettlebell swings, use sandbags if you can and for lifting off the floor do Farmers walks. People often overlook how useful they are for getting your body used to lifting and moving. Plus you get to walk!   Once you get a feeling for weights start practising deadlifts etc. it'll provably take a month or two but you'll be fine."
leangains,38xw1v,GothicToast,2,Mon Jun 8 06:45:47 2015 UTC,"Hey so I replied to another comment on here but finally reviewed everything you said. I have a couple things to comment on here for you.  -I think your calories are too low. You're about 1,000 calories under maintenance. You're going to lose muscle going this low. I would aim for the 1856 goal, for at least a couple of weeks and ease yourself into it. Think of the long term, build a solid foundation..you'll be more likely to binge if you go so low. -As far as lifting weights goes, look into some fitness classes if you're nervous about talking to the gymbros and whatnot. You can sit in the back and observe and push yourself at your own pace while learning some moves - then use them and modify them on your own. -The walking for an hour and a half is quite a lot, are you tracking your heart rate during this time? Making sure your heart rate is in the fat burning zone is quite important to make sure your exercise is actually effective. Most people think because they spend a few hours in the gym/working out a day they're going somewhere, and while yes - they are...more than likely they're not as effective as they can be. Take a look at this image to get an idea of what im talking about.  You also may want to visit r/xxfitness it is a subreddit for female fitness redditors, you'll get a lot of good advice there. In addition r/loseit is a good subreddit for someone at your current level and then once you build more muscle r/gettingshredded is helpful as well (although they are a bit more serious than most other subreddits).

The last I did weights I even got some tips from this security guard from the local night club even gave me some tips. :)  Here, there's always a professional (someone with a degree in sports) that will help you make a workout plan, and they tend to make a plan for men and another for women.  Today I registered at the local gym, but for now I'm doing 15min cardio and getting used to the machines for the next 15 days as an warm up for something I don't know. It can be the  weights or something silly... I still got a feeling that I was being judged.  I also asked for help about how to eat, my questions about this 1200 calories per day, but that was not his area and I got 0 tips."

leangains,38xjwy,GothicToast,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"I read your post a couple times and can't really figure out what you are asking.  I would suggest not using MFP for anything other than tracking calories (and macros) consumed. Don't use the TDEE it gives you and don't look at the ""How many calories left"" either.  1percentedge offers you the Mifflin-St Jeor and Harris-Benedict formulas, which are standard in measuring TDEE. I highly doubt they will be more than 100 calories off from eachother.  Everyone's metabolism is a little bit different, so use the calculators as a starting point, and adjust your intake as you begin to understand how your weight is affected by your intake."
leangains,38xjwy,SmokesQuantity,2,Sun Jun 7 20:23:56 2015 UTC,Why would you want to avoid looking at how many calories you have left in MFP?
leangains,38xjwy,GothicToast,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:36:34 2015 UTC,"Because MFP arbitrarily adds in exercise, which skews the remaining sum because exercise is already built into your TDEE. It essentially double counts your exercise.  So for me, my goal is to consume 3000 calories a day. My TDEE is 2600. All I want to do is track how many calories I've consumed. Once I hit 3,000, I know I am done eating. However, on MFP, it tells me I've burned X amount of calories during ""exercise"", therefore I need to eat more than 3000 in order to eat the day at 3000. I don't care because I know that exercise is already accounted for in my 2,600 TDEE. The app itself will tell me I need to eat 3,200 calories since my goal is 3000 and I burned 200. (3200 - 200 = 3000). But of course, this is wrong.   Hopefully that made sense."
leangains,38xjwy,SmokesQuantity,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I calculate my tdee as if I'm sedentary, and then I add in my own estimation of exercise calories burned after I work out. So for me the calories I have left is pretty accurate.   The way you have it set up, I'm confused why you even enter in your exercise if it's already been estimated and added to your calorie goal. If you did it that way you could rely on mfp to give you an accurate count of what you have left to eat.   For me, I like knowing how much of each macro and micro nutrient I have left to eat for the day."
leangains,38xjwy,GothicToast,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'm confused why you even enter in your exercise if it's already been estimated and added to your calorie goal.   I don't add in any exercise. It automatically adds it in for me based on how far I walk or run with my phone on me. Now that we are having this conversation, I have realized that I can turn the step counter off on my phone and I assume that tomorrow I will have 0 cals added to exercise. I feel a tad silly now.  Regarding TDEE, if you work a desk job 9-5 and go to the gym 3-4 times a week, chances are your TDEE actually is sedentary - and so you wouldn't want to add any more exercise in, as it is already accounted for. But if your set up is progressing you toward your goals, obviously stick with it.   For me, I like knowing how much of each macro and micro nutrient I have left to eat for the day.    Me too. I don't know why you think I don't do that. For example, my macros are 185gP/390gC/85gF. On the bottom of the ""Diary"" tab, there is a button titled ""Nutrition"". You can view that as a pie chart or a list. On the list tab, I can see how many grams of each macro I have eaten, which obviously tells me how close I am to reaching my goals."
leangains,38xjwy,SmokesQuantity,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's where I was confused. I wasn't even aware of the step counter or an option to auto add exercise.  And you're right, not sure why I assumed you wouldn't look at the nutrient portion but for some reason assumed you weren't using that for reference.   Regarding TDEE, if you work a desk job 9-5 and go to the gym 3-4 times a week, chances are your TDEE actually is sedentary - and so you wouldn't want to add any more exercise in, as it is already accounted for.    Maybe our wires are just crossed but if my tdee is 2300 @ 178lbs and 10% BF and I work out, wouldn't I want to eat a little more to compensate? I'm not cutting so if I run 5 miles im gonna have a bad day if I don't eat back those calories spent. When I lift I eat back a very lowball estimate (since I'm currently just maintaining) something like 150-200 depending on the volume, intensity and amount of accessory work I do that day.    But if your set up is progressing you toward your goals, obviously stick with it.   not only did this work for me on a cut, but I must not be eating enough as I've even leaned out slightly more since upping my intake back to maintence. (Then again I just lost all this weight and I haven't even figured out what maintenance is by one what the calculators say- i realize I have some trial and error ahead of me before I have a definitive answer there)  Thanks for the chat, it's helpful to hear how other people are doing things."
leangains,38xjwy,GothicToast,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"It is certainly possible we are just missing each others' points.   if my tdee is 2300 @ 178lbs and 10% BF and I work out, wouldn't I want to eat a little more to compensate?   It depends on what your goals are. Your TDEE includes your day to day activities and exercise in its calculation. So if your goal is to maintain, you would just eat at your TDEE and call it a day. If you are trying to add weight, then you would eat above that. How much above your TDEE is up to you. If you want to cut, you'd eat below your TDEE.  With that said, I do agree that 2,300 at 178 with 10% bf does seem low. You said you are maintaining right now. Therefore, however much you are eating right now is your ballpark TDEE, since by definition, you maintain on your TDEE."
leangains,38xjwy,SmokesQuantity,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"Right, so if I burn 500 calories running I should eat them back otherwise I'd be In a deficit. Or conversely, if I overeat 500 on a cheat day I can just burn 500 the next to even the score.  My TDEE doesn't include exercise, I chose sedentary."
leangains,38xjwy,GothicToast,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:36:58 2015 UTC,"My TDEE doesn't include exercise, I chose sedentary.    Right. I hear you. And it is my belief, and many others here in /r/leangains, that ""sedentary"" does include exercise if the only exercise you get is the 3 times you go to the gym during the week. If you work a 9-5 desk job and hang out at home sitting on the couch the rest of the week, then your workouts are included in your ""sedentary"" option. You don't need to add in more calories to offset your exercise. Choosing any other activity multiplier means that you live some sort of active lifestyle where you are on your feet all day.  With that said.. these calculators are just ballpark figures and the best calculator you will have is your own tracking of calories and witnessing for yourself how the scale moves with each adjustment. Everyone's metabolism is a bit different. As you have mentioned before, you have had success in your journey - which leads me to believe you know exactly what you are doing. The OP, however, was asking about TDEE calcs, and my advice to him would be to use ""sedentary"" and assume that that number includes his workouts. It is the safest option in my opinion."

leangains,38xe44,Yuanlairuci,2,Sun Jun 7 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"You can bulk, cut, or recomp.  You are not missing anything.  Recomping, imo, is really only a useful method if you are at a point you are happy with, close to your full genetic potential size wise, and there is not point going into a full bulk.  It's not something I would do, or something I ever have done, but it all depends on your goals."
leangains,38xe44,T_muld,2,Sun Jun 7 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"This is spot on, OP. Recomps are much easier to maintain as a part of a lifestyle but it will take a much longer time. Don't expect a noticeable difference for at least a year. Noticeable = you'll start receiving compliments from people who know you. Progress pics are a must because results come so slowly. You will think you're not making any progress (I prefer every 2 weeks but once a month is sufficient) but the pics will act as reassurance.   If you want something fast for the summer, cut. Then start doing a tiny bulk or recomp. As long as your strength is going up and you're not getting fat, you're on the right track."
leangains,38xe44,hiroshi-ma2,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I'd like to ask your opinion then on whether I should bulk or cut. I'm at a point where, after many years of neglecting everything below the chest, for the most part and dreading cardio, I'm at 6'3"" and 190 at 23.  Weight wise I'm about where I want to be, but I need to fix the imbalance between my upper and lower body which isn't likely to happen on a constant deficit.  On the fat side I'm fairly happy except that I have some fat stored around my lower abs and hips that I'd like to burn. Would it be wise to try going 20/20 for a few weeks and see if I'm getting progress on both fronts or should i cut then lean bulk or bulk then cut?"
leangains,38xe44,tontyboy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"You haven't misunderstood.  Martin (and me, but trust him over me) saw the whole programme as one big mini cut/bulk cycle or something.  The best thing to do would be to pick a goal, or let us know your goal, then decide on the most efficient way to achieve that goal based on your set up.    I'd do that rather than worry about the minutiae of what everyone else does (it'll drive you nuts)."
leangains,38xe44,tontyboy,2,Sun Jun 7 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"OK, well here's what I've got going on now:  I'm male, 6'3"" and about 190 lbs with some fat around the lower abs and hips. Probably about 20% bf.  I work out alone and without a spotter so I don't know my weights with actual free weights but with one of those guide rail machines I do 3 plates for 1 rep benching and about 180 lbs 3x6 squatting. I'm still figuring out proper form for squatting after a lifetime of fuckarounditis so I'm working up to actually throwing on everything I can handle and going for gold. I know I need to start doing deadlifts but frankly they scare me a little since I don't have anyone to correct my form and I've never even seen anyone do a deadlift at my gym (I live in China and my gym is small. Mostly just weekend warriors with the exception of one guy who seems to be more into isolation than big compound lifts. He's a big mofo though). For those I'm kind of holding off until I'm feeling brave.   As far as goals go, I want what we all want in the end: to get bigger and leaner. I especially want to make up for never working my core or legs very much and start rounding out my strength while getting my bf% down to a point where I look cut instead of just big chested with a soft stomach (I'm sure you know the look). So, what I originally set out to do was cut to 175 then lean bulk to around 190 again, but it's been a few weeks and while I've seen some improvement around my upper abs, the lower abs and hips don't seem to be changing much at all and I'm feeling weaker overall throughout the day.   IF on a +20/-20 cycle looks to be a good way to keep myself properly fed, improving in strength, and cutting fat at the same time. Seems almost too good to be true to be honest haha. One concern I do have is that my TDEE is around 3k most days. I've been using myfitnesspal and pacer to measure my actual calorie burn and since I walk almost everywhere I go, I tend to add around 500-700 Calories to my already relatively high BRM of 2400 by the end of the day. If I'm going to eat a 20% surplus on workdays, that's 3.7k Calories which is an almost daunting amount of food to consume in 2 meals, especially if I'm trying to eat clean because there isn't a whole lot in the way of clean eating options here.   Any insight? Would the 20/20 route be best for what I'm trying to achieve? If I were to get a quick and dirty 1200 calories out of a whopper for example, would the effect of the shit quality of the calories be mitigated a bit by the nature of IF or am I going to need to find a place to buy like 5 grilled chicken breasts every day?"
leangains,38xe44,tontyboy,3,Sun Jun 7 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"Would the 20/20 route be best for what I'm trying to achieve?   no, that would be the worst.  I'd honestly spend a whole year simply trying to get as strong as possible, and keep one eye on the scale.  Cutting is easy, putting muscle on is really hard so be prepared for the long haul.  As long as you keep getting stronger, week after week, month after month, and don't put on too much weight you'll be fine.  Pick a programme you can do, and one that you will stick to.  5/3/1 is good in this respect as you can download a spreadsheet and it'll give you months worth of your exact workouts, can make it easier to comprehend the task ahead of you.  That's it.  Fiendishly simple, but very hard."

leangains,38wbdl,tontyboy,7,Sun Jun 7 11:07:17 2015 UTC,"Well it kind of makes sense (for me). You get more repair material and your body does not have to worry about the deficit and where to get the calories from.  But are two days significant in any way? I personally started not to care too much about that. The 31min cutting macros places you in a 1lb per week deficit. So you would have to consume an extra 3500 kcal on top of your, say 2500, maintenance kcal to gain 1lb. And if you are doing IF and try to eat 4000+kcal each of those two days, in two meald, then you are a beast. When people stress about 100kcal banana or a beer on one of the days, just rememeber that you are still in a deficit. More important, I would say, is to enjoy life even if that makes the weight loss slightly slower. That only makes diet a breeze."
leangains,38wbdl,cheesecakeLord,3,Sun Jun 7 12:19:40 2015 UTC,"But are two days significant in any way?   No, of course not.  I agree.  However, the sub is full of people saying they fucked up their diets because they went on holiday or went away with business and stuff.  My point is, unless you're training like a small child then it doesn't matter.  Just reinforcing that if you train with adequate intensity at all times then you have way more leeway and don't have to moan so much if something goes wrong."
leangains,38wbdl,cheesecakeLord,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:55:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, not only that these days do not matter weight wise, but you can see them more like an ""recovery boost"" days or ""more muscle built/retained"" days. I do not associate them personally to any negative effects. Had only one week where my weight stalled, but I am skinny already and happy with how I look so no harm there. For me the ""bulk"" is probably a good thing anyway."
leangains,38wbdl,bourbonhipster,4,Sun Jun 7 13:26:50 2015 UTC,"i think first and foremost theres a psychologically inflicted wound when you are in one certain type of mode and then you do something that is counter-productive for those goals.   I know personally when i am trying to cut off body fat and i binge for 2 days, i feel fluffy as fuck by day 3. and probably will until another day or two after that. but ultimately its not the end of the world.   Heres the tricky part though IMO - maintaining momentum. I dont feel like after week 12 on a cut that my body can just suddenly go into 'bulk mode' - i dont know if a 2 day binge is really going to have much of an effect on my strength or muscle composition. I do know ill fluff out a bit as a result.   I think its more important to be consistent and get to whichever goal you are trying to get to as quickly as possible so that you dont have to lose your mind and sweat the small stuff.  Ive definitely learned though that OVER TIME - if you are being more lax about your caloric intake, and still training intensely, you tend to not gain as much fat as you might fear.   Recently and still going through such a phase and lifts are slowly going up, and legs are looking bigger than ever."
leangains,38wbdl,eur0pa,2,Sun Jun 7 12:19:42 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with the ""wound"" thing.  But yeah, knowing that ok you overate, but you had a brutal workout so the worst that's happening is you are gonna recover faster.  That's a neat psychological trick you can use.  However, overeat and sit on your ass all weekend?  Well, that's worse, objectively."

Being in a strict ""cut"" or ""bulk"" cycle can be mentally draining - if you deviate from your usual meals on a cut you'll be worrying about eating too much, and on a bulk you'll be worried if you're eating enough. Why not just live life, eat high protein, fibrous veggies and binge when you feel like it? There's more to life than the visibility of your abs and your body fat percentage."
leangains,38wbdl,soci4ldrinkr,2,Sun Jun 7 14:04:12 2015 UTC,Yeah this is the way I looked at it since the beginning.  Training intensity should always be the one thing that remains constant whether or not diet doesn't.   It's funny because I've read so many posters on here where people  say I was on lean gains so-and-so months ago and had great results but couldn't continue blah blah blah because of my diet  situation or whatever . If they would've just continued lifting then started up again with just the diet they would of should of  put on a bunch of muscle along with whatever fat they gained. So keep lifting hard no matter what the diet situation. Good post.

I keep getting stronger despite being in a deficit and losing weight. Theoretically, it would seem at some point that neural adaptions or what have you can't contribute much more strength-wise and that an increase in muscle mass is really the only way to get stronger. I think this becomes even more true for ""advanced"" lifters (in terms of strength levels and time spent training).  My logic is if I can continue getting stronger while cutting, does it make sense to go to maintenance or bulk? My plan is to cut until I think I'm around 5-6% body fat and reverse diet to some kind of maintenance. In my mind, it doesn't make sense to ""bulk"" if I can keep increasing my strength."
leangains,38wbdl,simple_mech,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"the worst that's gonna happen is you build muscle   Unless I'm very wrong, there is a theoretical limit to how much you can devour at once and use for recovery fuel before the value of extra calories starts diminishing and splitting up your meals may just be more effective.

I might do a French Toast eating contest tomorrow at work, and I've been wondering if I can justify it.    I've also been thinking that if I push myself as hard as I possibly can while working out in my fasted, caloric deficit state, I should be able to work out harder when I am in a constant caloric surplus, no?    This probably wasn't exactly in line with your original post, but that's what it reminded me of.  Workout with full intensity every time and you should be good, regardless if you happen to under or over eat, depending on what your goals are."

It's hardly a massive binge is it.  Totally missing the wood for the trees.  to answer the second question, in my experience then no.  A ""surplus"" doesn't make you stronger or give you more energy or more focus at lifting time.  It helps you recover better because your body can repair itself with room to spare.  I always think about it as a car full of petrol.  Your car won't go any faster whether it is full or half full or empty (objectively speaking, don't get pedantic).  But if you have barely enough petrol to get home you can manage it a few ways.  Gun it for a few miles, then go really slowly.  Go at a moderate speed all the way.  Both will get you home.  Having a full tank means you can do whatever you want, but you still can't objectively get there any quicker.  It just means that you've got some wiggle room and psychologically you don't have to pace yourself.    Think about your exact fasted training situation.  You aren't stronger or weaker because you plan on eating a calorie surplus AFTERWARDS and therefore say ate at a surplus 48 hours earlier or whatever.  Your body just doesn't work like that.  The reason for working out very hard during cutting is to break your muscle tissue to a level where when you eat, your body has to repair them as a first point of call, with the food it has available, hence retaining muscle on a cut.  The reason for working out very hard during bulking is to break your muscle tissue to a level where when you eat, your body will repair itself as a first point of call.  You are trying to shuttle your food towards repairing damage rather than being stored as fat.  I've said it before and i'll say it again, your body simply isn't going to build muscle just because you calculated your macros carefully and went to the gym.  Edit - clarified something"

leangains,38v9jb,simple_mech,-2,Sun Jun 7 06:41:58 2015 UTC,"Kava is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth. Don’t use it. Serious illness, including liver damage, has occurred even with short-term use of normal doses. The use of kava for as little as one to three months has resulted in the need for liver transplants, and even death. Early symptoms of liver damage include yellowed eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, and dark urine. If you decide to take kava, despite warnings to the contrary, be sure to get frequent liver function tests.  -from WebMD"

leangains,38v9jb,bioneural,4,Sun Jun 7 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"WebMD is not a reputable source of sound medical advice. Do some (research)[http://livertox.nih.gov/KavaKava.htm] on your own. Compare different sources and come to your own conclusions.  and don't just ask your western doctor. I told my doctor I drank kava every day while working as a tour guide. ""You drink alcohol while working?"" he asked. SMH.   Kava is unsafe when you 1) consume it while drinking alcohol or taking other hepatotoxins and 2) consume the leaves and stems or preparations made from them. If you just consume the root and don't drinking booze you'll be fine. Look at the literature: the cases most often cited and with strong causality are from around 2000, when the global kava demand went through the roof and as a result herbal preparations began to include aerial parts.  I live in Hawaii. We have over 1,000 years of kava culture. If it killed people who drank it, it wouldn't have persisted so long. Same thing with the hundreds of other pacific island cultures that consume kava. I know 90 year olds who regularly drink kava.   I am convinced that it's perfectly fine to have kava. It's certainly better than alcohol and any other enthogen in the western world. And yet somehow taking shots is perfectly okay while kava is the most dangerous thing ever.  Why people perpetuate half truths about kava is beyond me. The fact is, a small handful of people died after chugging beer and then taking kava capsules known to be made of substandard kava aerial parts."

I think I might take the advice of /u/tontyboy and try to stick at maintenance TDEE calories for a while and having a bulking mindset instead of a bulking diet where I just train hard and envision my lifts getting stronger rather as a mental progression rather than fueling the caloric fire, so to speak."
leangains,38qecw,eur0pa,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:02:25 2015 UTC,What was your bulk like? How much were you eating over TDEE and how long did it take?
leangains,38qecw,Phil_Dakuchi,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:18:45 2015 UTC,"Bulk was more like 2250-2500 calories, I didnt monitor it as closely as everything else during the cutting phase. Went from ~175 in December to 193 in March and used the PHUL workout template."
leangains,38qecw,IWasWayOutWest,2,Sat Jun 6 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Well there's your problem! You went up 20lbs in a matter of 16 weeks so you were at a 4,375 calorie/week bulk.   If I could make a suggestion, I would do a recomp type maintenance for about 2 weeks then increase calories on workout days by 100 and maintain that for a week or two then increase it by another 100 and maintain that for another week or two then start applying /u/tontyboy's advice. The reasoning behind this is that you will only put on 600 calories/week which will help with recovery immensely while still putting on minimum, probably zero, fat.   There is no reason to go through much more grueling workouts, then plateau and have to waste time repeating the same weight and possibly failing again out of a false fear of gaining some weight. It is a waste of time, energy and will fuck with your head instead of just eating a little more and progressing much more smoothly. At 200 cals extra on workout days, that's  ~0.17lbs/week. You have mastered cutting so even if only half of that turns to muscle (more will be muscle but I'm talking worst case scenarios), it would take over 10 weeks (more like 3 months) to put on just 1lb of fat! You and I both know you can easily lose that in 1 week of cutting.   Point is, please do not be afraid of going up in weight, this will hinder your progress as a weightlifter in general. Calories are not the problem, it's a numbers game as I described above why you went up so fast. The numbers don't lie and you know how to manipulate them so use it to your advantage."

leangains,38qecw,tontyboy,7,Sat Jun 6 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"Good progress but yeah:   Some might argue that I may have lost some lean muscle tissue   it's not ""some"", it's 3kg out of 8.2kg you've lost — that's a lot. You were already pretty lean (number-wise, not aesthetically) to start with, you should've gone with a shallower deficit.  You've dieted 75 days (presumably) and lost 8.2 kilograms — that's a 63.140kcal total deficit, or a 842kcal daily deficit. See where I'm going?  You say your macros were set to TDEE-30 and TDEE-10, estimating a TDEE of...   1754 = 0.7 x → 2505 kcal 2227 = 0.9 x → 2474 kcal   Let's say 2500kcal, which for a 84kg male is pretty spot-on. Point is, your weekly deficit should've been  (2500 * 7) - ((1754 * 4) + (2227 * 3)) = 3803 kcal   for an approximate loss of  3803 / 3500 = 1.086 lbs/wk   a fairly certain pound every week. Point is you didn't do that. You've lost 8.2kg in 75 days.  8.2 * 2.2 * 3500 = 63.140kcal (real deficit) (3803 / 7) * 75  = 40.746kcal (planned deficit)   You have obviously mis-tracked something, leading you to a 155% increase in your deficit! That's why you've lost so much lean mass — you went from a standard and safe ~3500kcal deficit to a 5894kcal weekly deficit. That's a fucking lot. I get that soyl... what's that name, can be good and all, but you either mis-tracked something, or you didn't get the nutrients you thought you were, or your TDEE is not 2500kcal but 2800."
leangains,38qecw,cforres,4,Sat Jun 6 08:56:33 2015 UTC,"I saw the same thing too. His weight loss should have been 1.098 pounds, but he was losing more than double. At 2.083 - 1.098 = .985333 pounds extra lost per week = .985333 * 3500 calories = another 3450 calories deficit per week / 7 days = 493 calories below/in addition to the -30/-10 cut he thought he was doing. On average over 7 days, he needs to increase his food intake by 493 calories (distributed between rest & workout days) if he really wants to do a -30/-10 cut.   Overall though his progress was impressive, and for aesthetic purposes he looks better – but he lost about 6.61 pounds of muscle. The maximum one can build per week is .5 pounds of muscle (let's say it's .4 pounds/week), thus it would take him 6.61 pounds/.4 a little over 4 months to rebuild the muscle he previously had.   The thing is that when one is resistance training and eating sufficient protein, protein should be spared even on a VLCD (as low as 600 calories even) as long as one gets like 1.0-1.2 g of protein/pound of LBM.   Thus, I am thinking that it's all the aerobic activity from cycling that may have contributed to his LBM loss if anything. The bigger the cut, the more one has to cut/reduce aerobic activity."

I also noticed that with soylent my body seemed to digest the nutrients much more efficiently than with standard food.

I have a genuine question about your diet numbers. I'm a month or so into LG and very happy with how things are progressing. I'm also doing -30/-10 and I'm hitting my weekly weigh-ins nearly to a tee. Your TDEE, if your -10% value is accurate, seems to be around 2,400. That puts your weekly deficit around 3,750 (3x250+4x750) which is about a pound a week, or half of what you ended up losing.   Now of course, I'm not questioning your results, you've clearly lost the weight. I'm just trying to see where the calculations don't line up. Lifting no doubt used up more energy, and maybe you do some sports or other cardio? You mentioned you tracked progress but the above suggests you were way ahead of schedule.

Or it could be a 500kcal higher TDEE I guess. Or a busier lifestyle in general. I'm only focussing on it because refining/recalculating your TDEE is supposedly a very important step along the way."
leangains,38qecw,davevo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:50:37 2015 UTC,It wasn't done every day only 2-3 times/week in the last 3 weeks and then not at all in the final week. Walking 3.5mpg at a 5% incline is only about 300-400 calories burned/hour. I usually did the LISS for about 30-45min when performed.
leangains,38qecw,AdolfHitter,2,Sat Jun 6 06:55:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, and those treadmill calculations often include metabolic energy (~100kcal/hr) and are thus very unreliable."

I'm saying you've burned a good 3,500kcal per week above your diet deficit if you've lost 2lb/week on -30/-10 of 2,400kcal.   Someone earlier pointed out that your DEXAs show you lost 10lb in 10 weeks which is perfectly in line with your deficit. The other 15lb must have either been water weight (!) or an inaccurate starting weight.   Either way, well done."

One of the reasons I ask is the supposed 1,200kcal minimum balance that should be maintained. You've probably gone under that regularly, which may not have been sustainable over a longer time, certainly not at your new lower TDEE post weight loss.   Just keep it in mind when you go into your next phase (maintainance/bulk?)."

leangains,38p1l5,Narthax,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"I'm beginning to wonder how effective LG is for a bulk. We see tons of success on here with people cutting to impressive body fat %, but there are very few successful bulks.  I'm not saying LG isn't bulk-friendly, because it really depends on your progressive overload and your diet, but I wonder if it's a coincidence that we don't see that many bulk posts.  For all we know, fasted training (Before you link me to martin's studies regarding the anabolic benefits of fasted training, i've read it) might be hindering growth in some ways we're unaware of. I think if there's any aspect of LG to eliminate, it would be training fasted (assuming you don't see results with all other factors taken into consideration)  (bracing myself for the downvotes because I'm not regurgitating the sidebar)  EDIT: I'd also like to point out that throughout martin's journey...he seems to allude to the fact that he got most of his size while discovering IF, not LG. I don't think martin discovered fasted training as an integral part of his routine until after he was already big. I think the 8 hour feeding window shouldn't have any effect on putting on muscle, but I do have my reservations with fasted training during a bulk.  EDIT 2: Lower your damn calories, fuck the calculator."
leangains,38p1l5,AdolfHitter,4,Fri Jun 5 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"I'm doing a successful bulk and did a lot of research into training fasted in regards to Mtor pathway response. I discovered that training completely fasted will lead to a poor mtor response (and hence poor protein synthesis and less muscular gains). However, training fasted using BCAAs (Leucine mainly) causes the mtor pathways to react as if the body is in the fed state and hence mtor pathway response is optimal. Figured i'd get flamed to shit if i made a thread about this by the die hard 31mins ama camp so i'll leave it here.  Basically if you're training fasted you NEED BCAAs on a bulk if you want to be as big/strong as possible. Leucine has also been proven to not knock your body out of fat burning mode so you get the best of both worlds.   blah blah customary pic as proof: http://i.imgur.com/ZcaKYCa.jpg"

You seem very angry but for the record I do have 15"" arms. Since you seem so interested in the ""look and actual substance"" of power, maybe you should read some Charles poliquin's work on BCAA's and fasted training, since he as after all, one of the world's leading strength coaches. ""Leucine is the branched-chain amino acid responsible for activating mTOR, the primary muscle building pathway in the body, spplementing with leucine alone is not however, the best plan. It's better to take leucine-enhanced BCAAs, this formula has been shown to be most effective for muscle building. "" He also states ""Training in a fasted state negates the mTOR pathway, however, supplementing with BCAA's pre workout puts your body into the same fed state as if you had eaten a meal and activates the mTOR pathway"" But i'm sure you know better than one of the foremost strength coaches who's written numerous  books and coaches Olympic athletes."
leangains,38p1l5,Ibakebread,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"I think you bring up a great point. LG is great while cutting, but bulking routines can have entirely different lifting regimens. I think the principle of IF and LG work great to minimize overall fat gain during a bulk but at the end of the day, it's all about being in a surplus of calories on a bulk. Lift heavy and often and eat lots of food for a successful bulk."
leangains,38p1l5,simple_mech,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"Take this with a grain of salt since I have only done LG for a cut and am currently doing so,  but the reasons you see more cutting success stories than bulking progress reports is many fold.    The effects of a cut are much more quickly realized.  It is not rare to lose 10 pounds of body weight in a month.  Whereas,  that same amount of muscle gain on a slow bulk might take years. Therefore,  given equal participants in both cuts and bulks with equal additional new members to  both regimes,  you will see more cutting progress reports more often given the program's half life.  (not sure if half life is the proper phrase here.  Also I wasn't a math major,  so maybe I'm wrong here.)  Because cuts are faster,  I imagine they have higher compliance.  You get immediate feedback from the scale which produces a positive feedback loop that propels the process.  No need to make changes if the scale reads lower than it did 2 days ago.  A bulk is slower,  so those positive reinforcements come in the form of slow increases on the scale,  and slower/diminishing returns in terms of increasing the big lifts. This might lead to people burning out and trying something else. It makes sense that adherence would be lower. Subtracting something somewhat enjoyable (such as food)  is a lot easier than adding something terrible (lifting really heavy).  Lifting heavy weights with the intensity required to maximize muscle gains is gruelling. I am certainly not capable of it yet. It takes some people years of experience to become capable of maximal effort in the gym,  and most will never achieve it.  Selection bias: Being fat sucks. And society let's you know it. Being skinny,  or skinny fat, doesn't suck so much.  Most of us are fat asses who spend our time on the internet.  We got tired of being fat asses and used our beloved Internet to find a solution. There are likely far fewer skinny people who are looking for a solution to something that society on the whole does not seem to view as a problem.    I'm sure there is a lot more to it as well.  Just 4 things that came to mind."

leangains,38ozhf,CharlieZX,5,Fri Jun 5 17:24:07 2015 UTC,"If you're working out for a long time, especially with a high intensity high volume (per week) program like a SMOLOV derivative, you're really going to benefit from getting calories during the workout. Especially frequent small doses of fast carbs.  I personally use Jelly Belly jelly beans for that, and I have 2-3 after each work set, and I sip water with them as needed. This makes a massive difference during long workouts... you will be preventing excessive muscle breakdown during exercise, you will be able to do more work and get a better training effect as a result, and finally you will likely feel much better during the workout.  I find that tart candies like Skittles upset my stomach during a workout, but the jelly beans are perfect. They also end up being mostly glucose, which is what you need. Corn syrup is just glucose, and the sucrose is 50% glucose, so your carbs are going to be ~75% glucose. That's kind of extra information, but for others like me who are health and/or fitness professionals it is good to know the fuel source breakdown for strategic intakes like this.  They're about 1g of sugar each, it's not very much but it's enough to make a noticeable difference when you are getting 2-3g of sugar every 2-3 minutes.  You're going to burn all that off, and during exercise your body does not use insulin to transport sugar into the working muscles (a different, intrinsic mechanism is responsible for doing that during exercise) so you don't need to worry about making yourself tired or blunting any kind of hormonal response you may be looking for.  The BCAA are a good idea, and you may want to get another 10-15g dose after 45-60 minutes. It won't hurt anything.  EDIT: If you want to do something like a carb shake, that's a good idea too. It will be better if it is~20-25% fructose, so half maltodextrin or waxy maize and half table sugar is a good mix. You can skew it slightly towards the malto if you want, like 60/40 or something.   I would just mix this into whatever water bottle you bring with you, and sip it throughout the workout just like you normally sip your water.  Either way, I would NOT start consuming carbs until literally either right before or right after your first set, at least if training fasted is a part of your specific goals."

I guess it won't hurt, and to be honest, I didn't feel particularly good the last half of my workout today (with the 10 grams of BCAA). I'm pretty sure the extra 40 calories won't ""break"" the fast.  Thanks for the response."
leangains,38ozhf,Joshua_Naterman,5,Fri Jun 5 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"No problem!  A quick clarification on what is happening when you exercise:   The proposed purpose of training ""fasted"" is to keep your body more capable of burning body fat, right? Insulin is the hormonal switch that will reduce fatty acid release from your stored fat. My understanding is that this is the reason people who want to lose more body fat are encouraged to consider ""fasted"" training.  BCAA's taken on their own will cause an insulin spike just like sugar will, so it's important to take them very close to the workout.  However: By waiting until you are exercising, you are eliminating the insulin spike that would normally accompany a decent BCAA dose, protein intake, or carbohydrate intake, particularly after an overnight fast. Even a moderate warm up is enough activity to blunt the insulin release, especially at these dosages.  The reason the surge is prevented is that insulin's job is to tell your muscle and fat tissue to temporarily add sugar transporters to their membranes so that they can soak up the blood sugar, and the release is primarily caused by a rapid rise in blood sugar detected by the pancreas.  Exercise causes your muscle tissue to add these sugar gates, just like insulin does, but there is no insulin required... chemical signalling inside working muscles does this all by itself, and to the same degree.  Because of this, your blood sugar will be soaked up, stored, and burned during exercise at a rate that will prevent the rapid rise in blood sugar that would normally cause the insulin spike.  That's why diabetics actually absorb carbs just fine when they exercise... even Type 1 diabetics, who typically cannot absorb carbs at all because they don't make any insulin."

I'm asking for the most efficient way of doing something I find convinient. My goal is not to be burning fat, my goal is to have a proper and not-catabolic workout fasted for convenience reasons. I know BCAAs are not going to make me lift more or get jacked or anything, it's just that I like eating a big meal after the gym and not worring about food until then."

If anyone is interested in more theoretical knowledge behind this particular abbreviated training strategy, I would suggest they pick up ""Beyond Brawn,"" by Stuart McRobert. That would actually make a great addition to the sidebar, since Martin claims it as the inspiration behind RPT. At any rate, I read a passage in it just this morning that basically said all any beginner needs to focus on is getting the big lifts up, a process that takes 2-5 years; yet, it is the beginner who will overthink, over intellectualize, and change up their routine at the drop of a hat in search of the ""perfect routine."" I am 100% guilty of this, and it has not served me well.   Tonty has actually said this before, but it's worth remembering that almost any routine will work, provided it's followed consistently. The point is to get your big lifts to the advanced stage, THEN tweak."

Most of the people posting here are novices.  They don't have any experience in proper strength and conditioning training, coaching, or mentoring.  So they take what Martin wrote years ago as gospel, and attack any who question it.  Example: RPT.  RPT is great for an advanced lifter cutting.  The average beginner or novice has neither the technical proficiency nor the CNS coordination to do high-intensity, max-effort lifts.  They would do better to pick any number of quality linear progressions (Candito, Grey Skull, Starting Strength, etc.) and get some quality time under the barbell before they try and run RPT.  Furthermore, Martin's guidelines for ""elite"" strength are interesting yard posts but by no means definitive.  I have a messed up L5-S1 and a rebuilt ACL in my right knee from jumping out of military airplanes.  The odds of me pulling 555-lb deadlift (3x my bodyweight) at this point are probably rather slim.  Does that mean I should just fucking give up on all training because I can't meet some arbitrary goals set by a dude on the internet?    Too many in this sub miss the forest for the trees.

leangains,38i1gn,Narthax,38,Fri Jun 5 05:25:59 2015 UTC,"So I think bulk wise RPT is too little volume for me and the way I want to look on a bulk. However, it's ideal for a cut. I understand it was designed for people who want to look great but don't want to be in the gym more than 3-4 times a week. Me? I love the gym, I love high volume, I love super-sets, I love feeling like I'm dieing mid workout, I'd be there seven days a week if it wasn't counter productive. When I work out I want to hit every muscle and achieve the absolute best physique I can possible, drug-free. That means on top of the typical ""big three"" I want to be hitting my rear delts, calves, bi's/tri's etc all within the rep ranges that they best grow in according to fibre type and other variables. That means using supersets, 6-12-25 rep protocols, Chest/back x2 a week, everything.  So for me, the actual training side can be improved for aesthetics when bulking.   I should also mention that I feel the numbers of +200-400 calorie above maintenance are too low with this amount of volume. I eat at +700 on workout days and -300 on rest days.

leangains,38i1gn,astrogirl,6,Fri Jun 5 05:44:09 2015 UTC,"Ideas from the ground up are not strong enough to change a growing community. Mods need to implement more stickied posts, the sidebar is failing the beginners and aggravating everyone else.  I believe in these stickied posts:   Leangains doesn't completely fit my lifestyle - What really matters checklist. The Idiots Guide to Cardio and why it is counterproductive. Which Strength progression model is best? Pick one. Pro's / Con's RPT, SS, Stronglifts Am I training with enough intensity? Probably not. The Patience of a Saint thread (Stupid questions thread sponsored by KY jelly) Why do I look like shit after years of going to the gym? - Fuckarounditis   There isn't even a sidebar on the mobile app. Human beings are dumb with short attention spans - we gravitate to stickied and top posts - period. Look at any major forum - they all have numerous stickies, because they work. I am willing to put these together with assistance from /u/mrsquat, /u/simple_mech & that pommy prick /u/tontyboy."

I've talked about the sub on xxfitness and women are afraid to come in here at all. Stickied  posts like those you mention might improve traffic and result in more interesting discussions.  Sometimes, you all seem like you just come in here to bitch at each other about minutia ."
leangains,38i1gn,GothicToast,-1,Wed Jun 10 12:52:00 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree. We aren't here to spoon feed people.   It's been repeatedly said that what's important is lifting heavy and diet.   Cardio has been spoken of but isn't really mentioned much but it's not the end all. I do cardio. Soccer, basketball, swim here and there.   There is no ""best"" progression. If time is an issue then probably RPT. Otherwise how can you say X is better than Y if I'm not making progression on X?   You already answered that one.   Fuckaroundits is linked.   Why do people say there's no sidebar on the mobile app? There is on mine. Also you shouldn't be learning about the entire program on your phone. You can always see it through the phone browser anyway.   If you have a short attention span and can't sit yourself down for a bit, to read some info about a hobby that you choose, then good riddance."
leangains,38i1gn,simple_mech,3,Sat Jun 6 04:52:26 2015 UTC,We aren't here to spoon feed people.    You just sound bitter. What are we here for if not to help eachother? I can't believe you are a mod and I hope your views do not represent all of the mod's attitudes.

leangains,38i1gn,simple_mech,2,Sun Jun 7 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be babied. I know and understand all the principles that guide leangains. So much so that it really doesn't take that long for me to respond to novices' questions. In fact, I even enjoy helping people. Weird, I know. Your issue is not that you don't want to help people.. its that you are in a ""leadership role"" and do not want to help people. As someone who has been part of this community for over a year, I find it disheartening that a mod here has that type of attitude.   I have no doubt that you were not always like this. Perhaps you became jaded after answering the same question for the umpteenth time. Unfortunately, this is the plight of a teacher and a leader. Imagine if everyone in the community adopted the same attitude as you? We would die off very quickly. Fitness is a bandwagon we should encourage everyone to hop on. We shouldn't just roll through town and say, ""Wheels are moving! Better run fast if you want to catch us!"" We should stop and help everyone get in."

That's my main point in telling people to look for themselves.   Think about problem solving in school. If I ask you ""how do I solve this problem"" you can tell me and we'll be done. I may have learned how to solve these types of problems but probably not. Then there's another problem and I haven't learned how to figure it out for myself yet. It's not just about learning that particular thing, it's about learning how to search for your own answers."

leangains,38i1gn,simple_mech,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree.  Lifting heavy and eating has been said to death - but what has changed? Nothing. The same questions and the same dumb ideas keep being posted day after day.  We live in a mobile age, I research the majority of what I want to know from my mobile. This is just the age we live in. I can't see the sidebar on my phone - neither can others. If the sidebar worked, why are the same threads being posted?  The problem lies in the structure of the subreddit, there are simply too many individuals with the same issues to call it coincidence.   We aren't here to spoonfeed people? Umm what? That's exactly what we are doing day after day mate. Except with stickies, the hard part is done and put on automation. The progression thread would simply outline the differences between strength models - emphasis on picking one and sticking it out.  That's cool that you do cardio. That doesn't mean it isn't counterproductive to weightlifting.  Regarding: Short attentionn spans - rubbish argument. I was simply highlighting how effective sticky posts are. Theres a reason companies sink thousands into getting their website to the top of google."
leangains,38i1gn,aesthetic-as-fuck,0,Sat Jun 6 10:28:23 2015 UTC,"The same questions keep getting posted day after day and the same answers keep getting posted as well. People just need reassurance.   We do live in a mobile age and I do 99% of my redditing through my phone as well. I don't understand why people can't see the sidebar. What app are you guys using? Like I said, you can ALWAYS open reddit through your phone's internet browser. The same threads being posted are, again, because people need reassurance.   People have the same issue because people are similar and wonder too much about the same things. I mean how many things can we possibly wonder about if it's the same program? A lot of it will be similar.   It's not what we do day after day. I believe the sidebar has enough resources for those that want to learn. The difference is in the user's thinking that instead of ""I want to learn, let me take in this information"" a lot of users have the ""I want to learn, teach me"" attitude.   What do you mean progression thread?   It really isn't THAT counterproductive as long as you don't go full blast on intensity. I'm not sprinting up and down the court, I'm leisurely jogging. I'm not doing intense laps in the pool, just nice smooth swimming. It's just another for of LISS. My lifts are still progressing as expecting so it's not hindering my lifts.   Yes, companies spend thousands of dollars to get their website at the top of google for numerous reasons. Real estate on the web, making profit, etc. This isn't any of those cases. We aren't competing against others to get traffic here. Users CHOOSE to come and this is their hobby.   With that in mind, I am not against making stickies and discussing different aspects of leangains and seeing what worked for some and what didn't for others, after all this is a forum and I think that's just what this place needs. What I am against is just going to leangains.com and reiterating what is said on the website in post form. Either way I'd like to hear what ideas you have in mind."

leangains,38i1gn,Randy-Randerson,13,Thu Jun 4 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"Good post.   I've run many self experiments, they're fun and it's not like a lot can go wrong.    Some of the things I recommend are based on my experiences and I always try to label them as such.    However, there is a further disconnect between people who place more validity in a study/theory than in real world experiences.  So we're at an impasse really, same as always.   I think it all comes back to - leangains can be done by complete beginners. But you have to study and learn as you go. I class a beginner as someone with no dieting and bodybuilding knowledge, or even the ability or experience of learning a new skill. I think everyone else classes a beginner as someone who is simply untrained.  I think there's a massive difference.    Does that make any sense mrsquat?   I am also all for discussion. Personally I enjoy reading about how people psychologically deal with their behaviour and motivation day after day."
leangains,38i1gn,soci4ldrinkr,7,Thu Jun 4 11:15:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  A lot of people who are new to diet structuring and working out often seek to customize routines before they've even tried them. They're much better off running a standard routine for a while untill they get a better understanding of how things work and how their body responds to different things. Then experiment with altering their protocol. Actually tracking what you do, and how it works is obviously important.  I ran the standard 31m RPT for two months on a cut. Now I'm doing it again but switched out a few leg exercises, and added 1-2 bonus days, lighter intensity, doing core, grip and some posture/prehab exercises alobg with mobility/foam rolling. It works well, for me, but I'd still recommend someone who's new to lifting and LG to follow one of the standard routines then modify later."
leangains,38i1gn,ThatLeviathan,3,Thu Jun 4 12:04:00 2015 UTC,"However, there is a further disconnect between people who place more validity in a study/theory than in real world experiences. So we're at an impasse really, same as always.   A theory/study is validated by it's results in the real world. A great theory has predictive value for the real world. Also, science/research is performed on a group-level. You take a group of some people, say 35, and have them do squats and drink milk or whatever. 28 get strong and gain muscle, 5 stay the same, two guys get weaker or injured. Great results from the study, but for any given single individual you have to try it out and see if you are one of the 28, 5, or 2.   I don't meet many people with good scientific training that make a great distinction between studies and the real world. Without the scientific training, a study is useless - which is rampant on the internet.   I think it all comes back to - leangains can be done by complete beginners. But you have to study and learn as you go. I class a beginner as someone with no dieting and bodybuilding knowledge, or even the ability or experience of learning a new skill. I think everyone else classes a beginner as someone who is simply untrained. I think there's a massive difference.  Does that make any sense mrsquat?   Ahh, defintions ;) Yes, makes perfect sense. The difference between your two beginner types is that they are beginners in two seperate things, one in planning their training, the other in performing training.   An untrained beginner with time and google skills can work their way through leangains and implement it, using nothing but the sidebar. Any concept looks foreign, google it. Any question not answered by the material means it's no. Such as ""can I put coconut oil in my coffee?"" No. ""Can I train more often?"" No. Etc."

leangains,38i1gn,soci4ldrinkr,5,Fri Jun 5 09:28:55 2015 UTC,"The LG program isn't perfect, just like Starting Strength isn't perfect.  Both can and should be heavily modified (or, in the case of SS, completely left behind for better programs for more advanced trainees) to fit a subject's needs...after that subject has developed enough experience to know what they need.  The reason that people say ""Just follow the program as-is"" is because too many noobs think they're special snowflakes that need to modify the program from the start because [Pick any that apply]:   They're extra fat They're extra skinny Their metabolism is slow Their metabolism is fast They work out so much They work out so little They have an underlying medical condition They don't have enough time They're too old They're too young   In reality, the number of folks who cannot actually follow the LG program as designed is very low, and almost all of them are just psychologically incapable of going 14-16 hours without eating and maintain compliance.  I don't truly follow LG anymore; I count my calories, shoot for high protein, but I usually eat the same amount of calories every day, don't bother tracking fat and carbs, and I fast for closer to 20 hours a day, along with doing a 40-hour fast every week or two.  I'm not as careful on the weekends, though I do at least try to track intake.  I find that I'm able to be compliant on this program, and I'm losing fat at an acceptable rate.  But I've been doing LG/IF for over 3 years, and I've learned what works for me.  Noobs have not, and should just do the program for half a year at least to learn how it works for them."

leangains,38i1gn,tontyboy,6,Fri Jun 5 11:33:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, never lower than the low teens BF%, at 6'3"" and a bit under 220. But that's mostly a compliance issue    I appreciate the honesty. I hope you don't mind that I use your post as an example of exactly the case I was talking about in the op.  See, the standard by which you judge your own ""modifications"" is pretty low based on your results so far. After having been at it for 3 years, and still having compliance issues it's pretty obvious to the outsider that what you've been doing these 3 years isn't that great, with sub-par results.  From within the headspace of yourself, it's impossible to be objective about these things, so don't feel too bad. What you are doing now - and losing fat at an acceptable rate - is rather outside the ordinary, the occasional 40h fast for example with regular 20h fasts are going to be a net negative for most people and will result in muscle loss. You may be experiencing this yourself without realizing it or admitting it to yourself. As I said, being objective under these circumstances is impossible.  I guess from your post that you do these mods from a compliance perspective, that you deal with the cheats and missteps by overcompensating with fasting periods, etc. This is a common mistake, which will result in muscle loss. Feel free to prove me wrong, but   See, it's easy to get to low teens. Everybody can do it, even statistical outliers. What really matters, for you, is going from low teens to your goal of 10%.  In your case, instead of planning around your weaknesses you compensate by modifying the program, increasing fasts etc, while never having actually succeeded with the original program.  What you really need is the original leangains program, followed to a t, with calories adjusted when you stall. No 40h fasts, no ""I don't count on the weekends"". If you have problems with weekend binges, plan around them better instead of compensating afterwards.  Like I said, just using you as an example. Nothing personal against you, and I could be 100% wrong about all my assumptions. And like everyone else feel free to post your results and your modifications if they prove successful. But you are still the person I'm talking about in my op."

Therein lies the problem with them, they are simply too lazy to bother reading the published literature on the side, let alone the leangains website and too impatient to follow the program and diet advice for anymore than a couple of weeks.  They just look at the photos on the site and come here when they aren't ripped in a couple of weeks asking why.  Then claim that this sub is toxic and full of meanies when they get a response calling out their laziness and lack of any methodical experimentation or real experience.  Most newbs are just looking for a quick fix to be ripped and swole and have no understanding of what it takes to achieve and look at the word ""leangains"" like they do a pro in the glossy magazines.  I totally agree with your post though, and think that anyone new to this should follow the program and diet advice as written for a length of time before coming in and immediately bastardizing it and complaining it doesn't work or is inferior."
leangains,38i1gn,matt182,3,Thu Jun 4 10:35:04 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a lot of what you are talking about too, but I think a big issue shows up when people with a serious amount of weight to lose come in wanting to do the bare minimum without doing any solid research or reading and expecting amazing results.    I've never been fat.  Skinny fat, yes, but not fatty num nums fat.  I tried a bastardized form of LG years ago where I mostly followed the fasting protocols, but ate as few carbs and calories as possible without cycling, and did kettlebell shit instead of real lifts.  Consequently, I didn't get anywhere great.    I've been lifting actual weight for a couple years now (admittedly with plenty of fuckarounditis thrown in there, so my lifts aren't where I would like), and started my first proper LG cut in Feb or so.  Even that wasn't as structured as it should be, but I was able to make progress with RPT and lose weight.  I then retooled my caloric and macro requirements, as well as threw in some full day fasting a few weeks ago.  It gets difficult, but I wanted to see how well it would work and if I had the mental fortitude to do it.  I like a challenge like that.  I've also found that only eating one large meal on rest days is much easier and more satisfying than breaking up a low calorie count into smaller meals.  My reason for giving those examples was to show the extremes of experimenting with LG.  Too much experimentation can, and likely will be detrimental, not to mention it isn't even LG at that point.  I think the RPT system as lined out by 31minutes, along with the proper caloric and macro counts, is probably the best way to consistently and easily lose weight.  I do have a few different movements in there though.  I like pull ups and chin ups, so I do them both.  I like ring dips, so I do them.  I also do Stiff legged, snatch grip, deadlift high pull things on squat days.  Whether those are too much or too complicated, I don't know.  But I figured I would see how well they worked.   Point being, I think experimentation within the RPT system, while keeping the same general concept of it intact, is a good way to go.  For bulking, I am not yet sold on RPT being the best.  I likely will do a modified version of it when I do a proper bulk, and maybe do 2 drop down sets to near failure for a bit more hypertrophy.  I don't know yet.  I still like the max effort top set though."

Until I found this subreddit I thought I was following LG, even after reading Martin's  site a couple of years ago, even the fuckarounditis article multiple times.   This subreddit made the light turn on for me and realize what I need to do to achieve my goals.   Most people just won't do the work and admit that they are too lazy to do their own research. If they did this place would be filled with articles just like this one showing how LG can work and be tweaked successfully and scientifically.

Even though you can find many posts on bodybuilding.com, /r/fitness and people like Menno Henselmans (http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/) who support recomps and are arguably in a better position to say so.

leangains,38i1gn,wyattdude,-1,Thu Jun 4 18:17:13 2015 UTC,He's talking about the strength goals outlined by Martin: http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html
leangains,38i1gn,anymanfitness,0,Thu Jun 4 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"I think, the point here is, we should at least BE ABLE to have open discussions on something that's not strictly Leangains in your book (because it may be in other people's books). Something like recomp, or hypertrophy routine + IF. I know Martin stated that 3x BW dead is elite level and everyone should strive for it but as a personal preference I may be happy with a 2x dead? Let me be then? I know Martin doesn't recommend it and 31mins doesn't recommend it, but as a lifestyle choice I like it, let me be then? I totally agree that the sub should be more supportive. Maybe people don't wanna take 100% leangains, let them take 50% then? Why is that not possible. Don't tell me it's a niche-sub and only hardcore fans are allowed to post. That's not the way internet forum works.   EDIT: Aesthetics is subjective."
leangains,38i1gn,Jollywog,4,Thu Jun 4 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"since when the fuck do we have DISCUSSIONS about these sort of things, this thread outstanding?!?!?  usually its in the form of a QUESTION.  ""AM I DOING THIS RIGHT!?!?!?!""  We hate those... beause RTFM!!!"
leangains,38i1gn,simple_mech,2,Thu Jun 4 22:46:53 2015 UTC,"I know Martin stated that 3x BW dead is elite level and everyone should strive for it but as a personal preference I may be happy with a 2x dead?   There is no reason to go beyond ones goals just because some guy on the internet prefers it or thinks it's better. I'm with you there. Not everyone is going for the maximum, or compete in bb or even anything."
leangains,38i1gn,Jollywog,0,Fri Jun 5 09:57:17 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely. I'm not trying to be elite. I'm just trying to be comfortable in my own skin.

leangains,38i1gn,Jollywog,0,Thu Jun 4 14:48:50 2015 UTC,I can't believe I just read this whole thread. When will people learn to stop arguing semantics vs discussing the actual topic at hand. There's no greater way to kill a discussion than attacking the person's character who's opinion differs from your own.
leangains,38i1gn,tontyboy,0,Thu Jun 4 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Once you have built a decent strength base, and assuming your goals are aesthetically based, it will likely be much more efficient gaining size lifting with a higher volume. 8 sets 3 times per week does require an insane amount of intensity to continue progression once you're at intermediate or advanced intermediate stages.  Possible doesn't always mean optimal......"
leangains,38i1gn,Narthax,-4,Thu Jun 4 15:31:04 2015 UTC,Funnily enough nobody on lean gains has a particularly impressive physique

leangains,38i1gn,soci4ldrinkr,-2,Thu Jun 4 14:17:21 2015 UTC,Yep.
leangains,38i1gn,soci4ldrinkr,2,Thu Jun 4 14:22:58 2015 UTC,There's an impressive physique in this thread. Check out the u/Narthax post. If you're not impressed then you must be a pretty miserable person.

leangains,38i1gn,soci4ldrinkr,3,Thu Jun 4 16:41:19 2015 UTC,I read your whole post. If you'd offered the same courtesy to the OP you wouldn't have wasted your time spewing out all that unrelated nonsense.
leangains,38i1gn,tontyboy,4,Thu Jun 4 11:11:11 2015 UTC,I glanced over your post too. I deduced you should not glance over posts and then post lengthy unrelated replies.

I'd love to see it. Otherwise shut your fat ass mouth. We don't need people like you around here. ""But hey you're supposed to be inviting and be nice to people"". No we don't. People like you can suck a dick and die, matter a fact suck 2 dicks and go back to /r/fitness.   Just took a quick browse through your post history. You are literally downvoted in every single comment you make. I can already predict what your response is going to be: ""well there's 1 comment where I wasn't and you said literally LULZ learn to read"". Get a life dude no one likes what you have to say.

leangains,38i1gn,tontyboy,6,Thu Jun 4 19:05:42 2015 UTC,A hahaha 13 upvotes! Do you tell that to your imaginary redpill girlfriend?   I think everyone finds it funny that your justification/balance for being a fat cunt is that you think lyle is an authority. How does that equate to anything?
leangains,38i1gn,simple_mech,4,Thu Jun 4 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"tonyboy, you're not even on my radar. You generally insult others, admitted you lack a basic understanding of biology, and preach broscience.  Lyle IS an authority – but alas, you, are not. But hey, I'll tell you to read the sidebar. Even better, I'll give you a direct link: http://www.leangains.com/2008/07/book-reviews-best-of-lyle-mcdonald.html  Martin says: ""Still, I consider Lyle to be the most sensible authority on all things nutrition related and in some cases I've resorted to nitpicking. I'm judging his work against an extremely high standard as I consider any of these books to be far superior to 99% of any run-of-the-mill diet book out there.""  Amusingly, he never said tonto was an authority on anything nutritionally related ;)  The funny thing is Berkhan created Leangains out of frustration with guys who preached broscience. You are of that variant it seems. You also seem to maintain I'm a fat cunt when I'm most likely in better shape than you.  I suggest you read a book if you want anyone of any significance to listen to you, because until then you're preaching to an empty chamber"

leangains,38i1gn,simple_mech,0,Thu Jun 4 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"So he says you use Lyle as an authority and you prove him right. You really are an idiot. You found leangains a month ago and lost some weight and now you have some confidence. Look at your post a month ago, you were a little bitch that took advice and shut his mouth. Nothing has changed except now you don't shut your mouth. That confidence you built up is fake. I know TRP tells you to fake it till you make it but you're trying a little too hard there, buddy.   ""I squat 3 plates"" Good for you, we all do, but you're over 200 fucking pounds! LMFAO that's barely 1.5x your bodyweight!  ""I don't push myself when cutting because I injure myself"" Try not having shitty form you fuck.   We have a hard ass attitude but one that is trying to inform people, you have a hard ass attitude in that you feel like everyone is attacking you and you need to defend yourself. You're just the epitome of a loser that lost some weight and now they think they're a big shot. You're still a computer nerd no matter how you spin it."
leangains,38i1gn,Arkann17,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"So he says you use Lyle as an authority and you prove him right. You really are an idiot.   Lyle is an authority, and Berkhan says as such. I'd wager most people who are informed would find either 2 to be far more credible than you.    You found leangains a month ago and lost some weight and now you have some confidence. Look at your post a month ago, you were a little bitch that took advice and shut his mouth. Nothing has changed except now you don't shut your mouth. That confidence you built up is fake. I know TRP tells you to fake it till you make it but you're trying a little too hard there, buddy.   I've always had confidence, and I've been a member, and have followed LG on and off for 2-3 years. I was here and posted when 31Minutes was here. I know that he corrected a lot of misconceptions that were around here including a lot of the advice that was being pushed here not too long ago.    ""I squat 3 plates"" Good for you, we all do, but you're over 200 fucking pounds! LMFAO that's barely 1.5x your bodyweight! ""I don't push myself when cutting because I injure myself"" Try not having shitty form you fuck.  ""I don't push myself when cutting because I injure myself"" Try not having shitty form you fuck.   I squat 3 plates recovering from an SI injury. As Rippetoe has said, “Accumulating injuries are the price we pay for the thrill of not having sat around on our asses."" I'm sure I can lift far more if I wanted to, but I'm on a greater caloric deficit, and I'm not going to chance hurting myself – you see on a cut there's simply less energy to lift heavy, and greater chance of hurting yourself, so all I can do is maintain what strength I have until I hit the BF %s I want. Also, most people around here can't squat 315+. It's a respectable weight to do. I weighed myself in today, and 315 squat at 210 pounds is at 1.5, though I'm at 208 and will continue to decrease.   We have a hard ass attitude but one that is trying to inform people, you have a hard ass attitude in that you feel like everyone is attacking you and you need to defend yourself. You're just the epitome of a loser that lost some weight and now they think they're a big shot. You're still a computer nerd no matter how you spin it.   Thanks for playing, but it's better to be a computer nerd, than a geek which you are. It's not that people around here have a ""hard ass attitude"" it's that a couple of you do. Most of the members aren't twats. You repeatedly also demonstrated on multiple times an improper and/or imprecise understanding of the underlying concepts of leangains, nor do you seem to have an interest in informing people but rather bashing them for no good reason (and if you think there is, most here don't seem to agree with you). You told me to look at the sidebar, but I can tell that on leangains.com, Martin made no specific recommendation to going from a cut to bulk directly (& as others have stated he recommends recomps for certain occasions too).   The irony also is that you are defending yourself and rather than taking the higher road by maintaining a respectful tone, you started from the beginning by emotionally lashing out as you so often do with many posters here. The funny thing, overall, though, is that you took offense that I said recomps are acceptable and telling me I'm wrong, when I know without a doubt, that they are sound. It's not even a matter of dispute."
leangains,38i1gn,simple_mech,0,Thu Jun 4 15:19:08 2015 UTC,"Again breaking things down point by point which I can do too and make you look stupid but I just don't care enough to do it. Showing, again, that you have nothing better to do.   And you're honestly the only person I've bashed. That's how far you push things. I've always been respectful but you are just too much."
leangains,38i1gn,tontyboy,-1,Thu Jun 4 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"bullshit, you're nothing but a fat cunt who last week was asking if you can build muscle on a cut and then deleted your posts.  ""ooo I'm injured"" fuck off you weak ass pussy.  And STOP MENTIOING RECOMPS!  No one even brought it up, you literally keep on and on and on about it and lyle saying it's ok during bulk and cuts.  NO ONE BROUGHT IT UP!  Tell you what, here's a challenge, go on a cut, don't post anything, and when you've finished (it might take a while because you're a hippo who can't train due to injury) go on a fucking recomp for 2 weeks and then come back and tell me what it achieved.  Deal?"

LMFAO then someone tells you to get off their dick and you take it literally with one of the most childish responses possible. You just aren't worth my time.

They literally were told to shut up/f-off. Guess were did they go? To Andy. Yes, he is immature, he has nothing new, he grabs info all around  internet and he has personal issues (you can see it on you tube).

It seems that all you do is tell people they're raging and then tell them they don't know how to read while saying things such as ""you don't know biology"" and ""you don't understand endocrinology"". What a tool. Have yet to see anything that proves you know anything about what you're talking about other than reading a few posts.
