digitalnomad,3e2dn2,MKRune,17,Tue Jul 21 12:45:43 2015 UTC,"No, you can pretty much live in Thailand all year round if you play it right, but it involves border runs and trips to Laos for extra visas. The 6 months in 12 months rule was years ago, hasn't been the case for years.  OK, first the basics.   You can get a single, double or triple entry tourist visa into Thailand valid for 60 days per entry. Each entry can be extended for 30 days at Immigration (giving you a total of 90 days per entry) for 1900 baht with a TM7 form and photocopies.  Triple entries are generally only available from consulates and embassies in Europe or the US. You can only get a double entry from Australia or (of all weird places) Vientiane, Laos. Singles in the rest of Asia (may not be the case in Northern Asia, is in SEA.)  So lets presume you get a double or triple.   You enter for 60 days, you get a 30 extension, which gets you to 90 days. You do a border run (from Chiang Mai that's to Mae Sai/ Tachiliek) cross the friendship bridge, get stamped in then out of Burma (costs US$10 or 500 baht) then cross the bridge then get stamped in again. 60 + 30 days. If you've got a triple do the same again, then 60+30 days. Eventually the visa is up.   You then need to get a new tourist visa. The best place in the region is Vientiane, Laos as it's the only one that issues double entry visas, the rest only issue single entries.   Travel to Vientiane (various options) you drop your passport and application off in the morning, pick up the new visa the following day in the afternoon, return to Thailand, then repeat and rinse per instructions above.  It's convoluted, daft in every aspect, but once you get use to it, it's entirely manageable. You could do this constantly for years, although there are occasional reports that Vientiane will stop issuing new TR visas to you after 2-3 years, but even then they'll stamp your passport saying you can't have any more when you get to that point...while issuing you another visa :)  In the unlikely point you get to that stage, you'll need to travel further abroad to get new visas."

digitalnomad,3e35lv,pomporn,3,Tue Jul 21 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be in tech at all. Use the legacy search on Reddit or Google with    site:reddit.com/r/digitalnomad   in the search to find some older threads on the topic like this.  You can also be a 'non-digital' nomad. Look into working holiday programs in your country. Here it's International Experience Canada. Also consider different arrangements, such as help exchanges (HelpX, WWOOF) or Couchsurfing. Many hostels will allow you to work in exchange for your stay, which isn't always a fair deal, but considering your position can be very helpful.  You can also combine these two mindsets, for instance if you have a relatively meagre income in, say, e-book self-publishing, you can spend a month or so scrimping using backpacker methods, then use that savings to fund a trip to an expensive area, like London.  One of the most useful and transferable skills you can have for either of these options is self-motivation. You have to be your own boss. This is harder than it sounds.  Tl;dr, research research research.  Good luck."

digitalnomad,3e1yiv,levelsi,3,Tue Jul 21 09:39:51 2015 UTC,"Couple of things, I get what you're trying to do, but it's simplistic; for example for Chang Mai you recommend visiting between November and April (I presume the green highlight is the preferable months) and that's wrong given hot season starts in March, and March through to June are the hottest months (I much prefer wet season personally, but either way, you wouldn't recommend the hottest months.)  Same to some extent for Bangkok as well.   Also are you using a median temp vs an average high, as the figures for CM are all wrong, particularly compared to both Wikipedia and my own experience. It's far hotter in CM across the year, taking the average high number, let alone in hot season, than your figures indicate, and in that regard to the casual viewer they could be deceiving."
digitalnomad,3e1yiv,jonez450reloaded,4,Tue Jul 21 10:47:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks Jonez!  It's median monthly temperatures, not highs.  I set the limit of ""best"" months to go at somewhat warm but not too warm (e.g. >15'C but < 35'C), that's why March and April still show up. I could lower that to upper limit to < 30'C. Then it'd be exactly as you'd specify it. So the question is, is above 30 too hot?  Update: I changed it to 30. It now shows Jan, Feb and Nov, Dec as best months. Is that more accurate you think? See: http://nomadlist.com/chiang-mai-thailand/info"

That's why you see me asking for money early on. Money coming in means I can continue working on it without having to sell out to investors. If I didn't, I literally wouldn't be able to work on this as it takes so much off my time. I hope that helps you see the perspective of why makers charge for things and can't offer everything they make for free. I see where you're coming from as a user, it'd be easier if everything was free but it's unrealistic.

You could also look at translation services, depending on your level of comfort with Spanish.   If you're willing to give up your lease/car/other possessions, it's actually cheaper to live on the road than with a lease in many cases. If you start somewhere like Thailand, you could stretch out $5k in savings to six months of very comfortable living.   The hardest part about this lifestyle is the first steps. Actually putting all the wheels in motion and getting the proper ducks into the proper rows. After the initial messiness, it's pretty easy.  (My major assumption there is that you have savings and/or means of finding freelance work. Freelance is made out to be tough, but it's only tough to build momentum — once the ball is rolling, things tend to keep rolling as long as you don't actively slow them down.)  Good luck!

digitalnomad,3dz3w4,jlengstorf,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the reply!  I've been looking into copywriting as a means to get the ball rolling, as you have said.  I'm not materialistic and I don't have a car, lease, or even many possessions, but somehow I still manage to get myself into debt.  It's not too bad, only about 4k left from some student loans, but it angers me how hard it is to just pay it all off.  It's like trying to lose those last 10 lbs you know you need to burn before you're at your fighting weight again.  I swear the U.S. is built to keep you in a cycle of consumerism and debt slavery so you can never experience your true potential, but enough with the dreariness.  I'm hoping to have 30 to 40k saved up before I pull the trigger.  I'm actually a freelancer now, so money will still trickle in for another 6 to 7 months after I quit to keep me fueled.  I'm deciding between Chiang Mai, Thailand and Medellin, Colombia, two cities that I absolutely love, but I want to do some other traveling as well before I move somewhere and settle down.  I've done it all before -- save up, quit, travel -- and I went right back to the same job and same city and same place I was in before.  I just need to get out now.  There's nothing left in this city for me anymore."

Copywriting is not a magic cure all stick for everyone who wants to travel the world. Unless you enjoy it and you're good at it and you can market it - most of the time it amounts to slave labour. Which is why so many digital nomads are eking a living on less than $1,000 a month. Teaching English abroad is easy - no degree required. Get a CELTA certificate and then touch down in Thailand, Cambodia, etc. and walk into a job (there aren't enough graduates to go round). It's also the classic job to keep you in room, board and beer money when traveling. Forget programming - if you haven't learned now, you won't make any money remotely until you've mastered a language and that's normally 6-12 months of work. (Possibly more). Do consider blogging for money. It's cheap and easy to set up a blog and monetize it now.    Good luck whichever way you jump."
digitalnomad,3dz3w4,TheGrinchOfSR,3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"Not at all, you're not being rude or unpopular at all; you're just telling it how it is and that's exactly what I asked for.   Much appreciated.  I have no idea how I'm going to come to terms with it; probably just lots and lots of time. Yeah, I'm honestly looking at probably building up my savings and living off that for a year, but I would love enough of an income to stretch being a nomad until I get burned out on the lifestyle. I have been looking at the prospect of teaching more intensely.  I was always told that not having a four-year degree would be detrimental in most countries, which is ridiculous considering my job as a stenographer involves little but English and grammar (and was also a four-year program).  I will look more into getting a CELTA certificate, and I also taught an English class in a Cambodian orphanage, but it was only for a month. Maybe programming is something I can work on on the side, just to have the knowledge to even use on my own blog or start my own projects down the line.  I took a programming class in high school, and while we were using (old Russian programming language that I can't even remember the name of), I picked it up pretty easily and enjoyed it.   Are there any good resources where I can learn about monetizing a blog?  I blogged for fun while I was traveling, but it was mostly just a mind dump on whatever stupid stuff I was thinking that day.  I have some ideas, though, to reach a lot of people, and I would love to focus in on those; and maybe there's even a business opportunity there...   Thanks again for the reply.  I hope to see you on the road someday soon."
digitalnomad,3dz3w4,keep_me_separated,3,Tue Jul 21 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. :-)  I forgot to mention you can do a CELTA in Thailand very cheaply compared to other places...   There are tons of resources on monetizing a blog - a lot depends on what you want to do with it... sell your own product, sell other people's (affiliate marketing), referral marketing (commissions on Amazon, Booking.com, etc.), Google adwords (paid-per-click), etc.  I quite like Spencer Haws niche blogging model... most of the data he produces is free to access and it's a low-risk profit making strategy compared to trying to conquer ""dieting"" or ""exercising""...  http://www.nichepursuits.com/"
digitalnomad,3dz3w4,TheGrinchOfSR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"Hi!  About blogging... I think that the most succesful blogs are the mind dump ones. Look at youtube's highest earning vloggers.  Almost all of them are just stupid stuff and mind dumping.  Also, you don't have to be tied down to just one blog.  You can have multiple ones with different subjects, or create one with a very broad ""mission"" and just post thing in different categories."
digitalnomad,3dz3w4,misskinky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:37 2015 UTC,That might work on YouTube... it won't work as a blogging strategy without a ton of additional marketing effort. Blogs on themes work because they get general SEO from each post... which cumulatively builds rankings over time. Blogs with no theme? Not a cat in hell's chance of SEO... so you're going to have to buy visitors long-term (SEM). That's a huge risk early doors for a blogger.

The quickest path may be copywriting. Otherwise, web design and marketing will get you a long way.  Just remember that you should always have a project or two on your own while you work for others. A website, app, eBook, etc.  Also, great job on learning Spanish. You did yourself a huge favor with that.  For copy writing, get some practice at a content mill(Textbroker, etc). You will work cheap in the beginning but keep your eyes on the prize."

I just want to fully live.  I'm definitely going to check out the copywriting companies that people have posted.   That seems the best way to earn a little extra cash now and set myself up for success as a DN.  I started a blog when I was backpacking for 8 months, but I wasn't really passionate about monetizing it or really marketing myself.  I guess I still have that fear about people judging me and my writing.    Gracias, amigo.  I dated a Colombian for four months while backpacking Europe, and while being the craziest girl I've ever dated, she made me talk to her only in Spanish.  I lose a lot of it while living in the Northeast, but it comes back quickly in Spanish-speaking countries.  Again, appreciate the kind words.

Want to find a comfortable, quiet, workspace with coffee and wi-fi and not pay insane money for it? Go to any information counter and ask; ""Which business class lounge operates a paid access scheme?"" (There's one in every airport).  This will come with all of the above (coffee, food and indeed beer, wine, spirits, etc. are all included in the price) and there will be no screaming children, angry tired tourists, etc. around to distract you.  I don't know how much it is in Schipol but it's normally $20-$30 in most places. You can often find discount coupons online - it's also worth checking with your bank(s) when you have time, many accounts now will provide free lounge access in airports (which makes it very, very good value)."

Also exploring ways to add people to my credit card for some passive income (look up credit piggybacking).   The best kind of job abroad is not a remote job. It is something that you own and is pretty passive, like your own ecommerce store or your affiliate sites, etc.   I am teaching myself programming too as a backup plan if this all fails on my face."

My advice would be to get an office job for a couple years, learn about how businesses are run and build some connections in a field you are interested in, and SAVE every penny you earn, then take the plunge.

The number 1 cause of hospitalization for expats (nomads too) in South East Asia is road accidents.   If you're close to the local expat community - they may have a whip round to help you. But don't count on that. (I know one guy who had his wounds left open in a Cambodian hospital for 3 days because he couldn't evidence his ability to pay from his hospital bed and another who flew to the UK with a broken leg from Dubai because he had no insurance - don't be those guys)."

digitalnomad,3dqtlt,MrBeatsOnToast,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:17 2015 UTC,Also heard bad word of mouth reviews about them when trying to claim
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,kanev91,2,Sun Jul 19 08:57:11 2015 UTC,"you mean they just promote a single insurance company here on a sidebar?? hm....  edit: so they want $1,201 for ""acute serious illness or acute serious injury"" only coverage? Isn't this what travel insurance is about that you get for $150-$200 a year?? Not $5 mil coverage, but mostly you can get fixed with a $100k. For $100 a month i can get a full expat medical insurance on brokerfish.com or get $200 travel insurance + local Chinese medical insurance for example for around $900 a year"
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,YourFatherFigure,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:34 2015 UTC,"Coming from the US and going to say Nepal, I see about $70/month or $850/year which covers $500k in evacuation and extreme sports.  What's the fine print say on $150-$200/year policies?  Does it cover repatriation of remains or just doctor visits.  I think travel cancellation stuff is standard with most policies, but often the gear insurance is pretty bad and worldnomads is ok.  I usually buy insurance right before I might need it (i.e. right before I do something kind of ill-advised)... I don't keep it ""always on"".  The fact that I can do that so easily is part of the appeal for me.  If you have a better solution I'm interested to hear it.. the only other thing I've looked at seriously is  ""roamright"" but it was hard to get a straight answer about what sports were covered."
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,kanev91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:23:07 2015 UTC,well i don't need extreme sports and i would rather get fixed where I am now in China than get evacuated to Russia. That's why I am looking for full expat insurance travel+health including severe cases. What I don't get is why there is such a big difference Allianz wants $4000 yearly for the same thing Swisscare wants $1500. With $500 deductible. Last thing I want to get into trouble and get screwed by the insurer
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,Techynot,2,Mon Jul 20 04:32:29 2015 UTC,Too expensive for digital nomads. I'm getting a quote of 80-90e per month. And that's with a 70e co-pay.
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,YourFatherFigure,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough but keep in mind this is travel insurance, and you gotta expect to pay extra for the possibility of coverage (almost) anywhere and coverage for (almost) anything. I'm super happy with it but that said my situation is this: I've never actually had to make any kind of claim, I travel constantly and don't know where I'll be when I actually need to use it, and I want coverage for everything from motorcycle tours to mountaineering.  That's a tall order and most days I'm impressed anyone is willing to cover it at all.  If you you're more static and only switch locations seasonally or something (say every 4 months) you can probably do better by using whatever the locals use."
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,bidzini,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"While I was living in Costa Rica, I had two urinary tract infection. It's cost me $100 each, which the insurance paid back. I was glad I had it, because it might not be a big expense, but if you don't have insurance, you don't want to go see a doctor. I'd definitely recommend having something, just in case you get something like that! (Okay, I'm a girl and I'm pretty sensitive to humidity, I've figured this out, but I'm still glad for my insurance) And I'm from Canada by the way, where we usually get free healthcare (if we're in our province for more than six months, which I'm not anymore)."

But if something happens I want them to cover all expenses not up to 50,000e like its the case with most local travel insurance policies. (Europe)  I checked out some websites but they offered a lot more coverage and thus were too expensive. World nomads is quoting me 80-90e per month. Even their 12 month coverage is 900-1000e. Don't see how that's feasible for longterm travellers.   Let me know what you can find."
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,Nymphetamean,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:42:01 2015 UTC,"looks like we need travel insurance + expat medical insurance + life insurance for cancer/aids cases. So from my research it is $200 per year + $100-200 per month (with $500 deductible) and the third option depends on the coverage but should be cheap   But company matters here, especially when you are travelling abroad all the time"
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,ToastPop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about this too. I'm doing a shorter term trip as a bit of a trial run before committing to the whole digital nomad life, since I am a person with a disability (gotta make sure I can deal with life on the road full time).   I'm going with World Nomads for my upcoming trip, but I agree that it doesn't seem feasible for long term travel. Of course, that could be because I'm in Canada and not used to paying for health insurance. My bank offers travel insurance, but they aren't sure if they will cover me and it's really expensive."
digitalnomad,3dqtlt,soggyindo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:21:32 2015 UTC,"Typical travel insurance by World Nomads will include things you probably don't need like covering your possessions. This boosts the costs hugely. Also, your coverage significantly drops depending on your home country's policies. For example, if I am Canadian and outside of my province for more than 6 months, my provincial coverage expires, which in turn lowers the overall coverage World Nomads will offer me, as per their terms.  I use April International, also a Canadian company, and they will cover anyone anywhere. Both this company and Ingle International (someone else mentioned) resell TIC travel insurance, it should be the same thing. I've never had to make claims on any of it though."

Getting a hold of you -- If you are anything like me, I make it extremely easy for clients to contact me, they are used to calling me, texting me, email etc and I get back very quickly. This is hard to do when you are overseas, I tried to forward my phone number to a Google Voice and have it on my cell phone, but it did not work all the time, internet connections are not good everywhere, etc.  This combined with the timezone change and the lack of 1 on 1 meetings upsets many clients in America.   Good luck!"
digitalnomad,3dd7hv,wonderliv,2,Wed Jul 15 13:22:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely be honest with your client(s), tell them what you're up to. (Software btw)  As an anecdote, my current client introduced me to some of his friends living abroad in the last city I was in.   (I mean if it wasn't obvious, you should try to give your clients the ""warm fuzzy feeling"" (WFF), make them like you and make them forget you're remote. Don't be brusque or closed off because you think you're hot stuff, you're replaceable, and if they don't get the WFF your months are limited)  Yes, on-demand availability is very important, and I make it clear it's there for them if there are important dates coming up, but if not, I give them a time range to contact me which overlaps with at least a good 3 hours of their work day.

In reality, most clients will get a same day response from me after I check my e-mail. But I'm not staying up until 4 a.m. to deal with clients in other time zones (tried it and couldn't do it effectively - which is a shame because that client was paying a lot of cash).

I try to use as much async communication as possible - video conferences are a total ballache for me.  For timezones, I try to not list two times with different timezones or with ambigious timezons (eg ""1pm PST, 5pm GMT"") and instead try to arrange thinks as ""1pm Los Angeles time"" - my clients are usually less experienced at timezone conversion than I am, so I try present as simple an interface as possible. (you might notice that the PST and GMT times don't match up in the above example, and the hypothetical client actually meant PDT...)  I try to get the kind of work that doesn't need urgent attention.  Clients come and go, though - don't be too scared about losing them."

digitalnomad,3d8x1v,alwaysonesmaller,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:46:29 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't recommend full-time remote work to someone who hasn't done a lot of travelling before. If your primary goal is to travel, I say do a backpacking trip on the cheap first. My answer is yes, it does tie you down from normal travels quite a bit."
digitalnomad,3d8x1v,ToastPop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"Even if you work 9-5 that still leaves the same amount of time you would have had at home to relax and enjoy yourself...except that you will be a in a new place so it's more interesting. Having said that, there are many people who subscribe to this lifestyle whose goal is minimizing work altogether -- check Tim Ferriss' book ""The Four Hour Workweek"" which is seen as catalyzing the DN movement to some extent. The idea being that if you can outsource or minimize the hours put into a business, you can make time to enjoy life or spend more time on business development and other productive aims. Personally I go for a 50/50 rule...spend half my working time each day on client work, half on business development and creative efforts to expand my business, and the remainder relaxing."
digitalnomad,3d8x1v,yuekit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:20:33 2015 UTC,"My freelancing is on no-one's clock but it's a full-time (and often more) job. I like that. It means I earn well and it means that when I am somewhere... I can enjoy it.   I'm based in Cambodia at the moment and the number of ""nomads"" who tell me they can't afford to see Angkor Wat (one of the seven wonders of the world and a measly $20 to get in) is shocking.   You have to find a balance that works for you. For me, that often means 3 weeks of hard-core slog and then a week off. Or 2 months of slog and then 2-3 weeks off...   When you work, you don't live like a backpacker, it's not all beaches, cocktails, parties and shagging (sadly). But... conversely you have more time to explore what it's like to live in a new place rather than acting like a tourist/backpacker. You can connect with expat communities, you can sit in local restaurants munching on local delicacies, you can find those out of the way spots which are only famous locally, etc.   Somewhere down the line travel seems to have become ""rush to tick off a list somewhere and then rush to the next place on the list and repeat"" rather than a relaxed, enjoyable experience. Choose your own balance rather than emulating other people's and you'll be much happier."
digitalnomad,3d8x1v,TheGrinchOfSR,0,Mon Jul 20 03:06:40 2015 UTC,"Does it actually feel like you can enjoy your travels,   No. But it could be if I really wanted it to. Work would suffer and I would be in a mix of stress and excitement. At least I wouldn't be bored? I am looking to build up savings and retirement funds. A lot of people, probably rich kids, just say others should ""just go out and travel, be happy!"". I don't have a rich family to fall back on so no, I don't enjoy my travels. I am always aware of the need to enough money for retirement.   or is it more of being at a new place doing the samething you would otherwise do at home?   Yes. But less than favorably timezone.   In other words, are you being tied down by your 8-5 commitments?    Yes. I would like to find a company to work from in a similar timezone and similar pay-rate."

I only work 25 hours a week, I travel and have fun the rest of the time because part of travelling for me was to learn to work to live not live to work.   What's the point if you're not having fun? Are you planning to wake up in 30 years time and realise that life is nearly finished, it's retirement and then try to start having fun?  I come from a family where food was scarce and that taught me to be able to live on very little and still be happy. I think it's a leap of an assumption to assume people who are telling you to be happy, are rich kids."

More like keep surviving. Where do you think money is going to come from when you are too tired/disabled to work? You think social security will still be around? The idea of not saving just isn't that bright, and the idea of devoting life to fun seems childish. Life is more than about having a sweet 16 party everyday. It's about persisting genetics and survival as well, and finances help that."

FYI, I still save more than when I was at home whilst only working 25 hours a week because I don't spend much. Often I volunteer in exhange for food and board so I get to help out, learn about culture, save money, develop and have fun.   ""the idea of devoting life to fun seems childish"" ~ Might want to tell that to Richard Branson.  Btw, what's the point of travelling if you arn't having fun and enjoying these places you're going to? Might as well go back to that 9-5 office job?

digitalnomad,3d3kvy,x3nomik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"2 times cheaper than normal taxi   I don't think I ever paid more than $3 or $4 to get anywhere around Shanghai (around Jingan & FC where I spent most of my time), have a hard time believing Uber can be half as cheap, like $1 or $2. That said I was recommended it many times to help w/ the not stopping problem w/ the taxis.  For me it was finding pockets of cafes, a street or a block that has a number of cool spots to work from. There's at least a dozen of such pockets scattered around, forgotten most of the cafe names. There are great spots around Ferguson Lane & Boxing Cat. The street with Citizen Cafe in Jingan has some good spots. There's Anfu St. w/ Amokka & Hunter Gatherer. There's that street by Xintiandi w/ the bars & cafes that's a more chill Yongkang (there's actually a couple good cafe streets around Xintinadi). Tianzifang has a couple good back alley spots, & some st. directly East of Tianzifang can't remember name, not to mention the mall complex by there with the decent open air cafes. A lot of great spots around Wuding & Yanping in Jingan. There's that street with Vienna cafe that has a couple good spots (other than Vienna). You can be a cliche expat & go to Sumerian or a few other such spots under the same brand, not a fan however. There's a great pocket of cafes w/ open air seating around Melange Oasis. There's a street with a quirky Sherlock Holmes themed cafe & a nice garden-style cafe nearby, somewhere in North East FC I forget. Yongkang St. is to be avoided IMO. There's another st. with a whole bunch of restaurants & cafes just SE of the 4 Seasons, had some cool spots... OK, enough indulging in memories.  I don't know overall there are probably ~25 cafes around Shanghai I would be more than happy working from given my preferences... by comparison San Francisco has maybe ~15 that get my stamp, Tokyo less than 10."

digitalnomad,3d04yz,Harry_Splotter,30,Sun Jul 12 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"It might actually just be your perception of the situation, as it is radically different from what social norms propagate. There is also the effect that your lifestyle is constant mix of travel and day-to-day life. You still might be biased to what both mean for you. (Common bias: Travelling = lazy time with family or friends constantly around oneself.)  Consider how many people there are that once they have left any environment where they are forced by design to get in touch with strangers, first and foremost schools and colleges, and are entering the workforce for the first time, maybe combined with relocating to a new place.  They don't know anyone outside the office. A lot of them rely on introductions through their workplace's colleagues and just hope that over time they will make friends and form a social circle. However loneliness is a serious problem and threat to society of our day and age, as (at least in the westernized world) people move over longer distances (losing close contact to family) and move more often, as the workplace requires it.   Life in general has become less steady. All this is even more stressed, as we have lost interest in church and community (harder to connect to strangers in your neighborhood or city) and the digital world allows us to distract ourselves from the task to change the situation.  Many people, especially singles, fall into the 9-5 rut...Mo-Fr: work, tv/internet, sleep until weekend is around the corner where you go out with colleagues or visit family, if at all. Repeat this for years only to be interrupted by the occasional holiday.  The internet is a blessing and a curse at the same time. Many people fall into the habit of staying in contact with their school friends, while not even trying to make new friends in their new surrounding.  Just look at gyms...99% of the people in most of the gyms never have talked to anyone in the gym. Everybody just does his thing and leaves only to return to their sheltered, anonymous life.  The sad part is that most of us don't even realize those flaws. Constant entertainment around us, plus the casual face-to-face office interaction with colleagues seems to have become enough to satisfy most of the people's basic need.    You perceive all this even more dramatically, as you might be changing location every once in a while and get thrown into a new surrounding 10x and more often than the regular 9-5 average Joe. Plus, you lack the casual office interaction.  I can only recommend you to change your perception and switch to seeing this as an unique opportunity given to you. You have the chance to meet new people regularly and figure out quickly (after some initial time invested) if the encounter has the potential for a quality friendship that is worth to maintain. Non nomadic people might be stuck in their rut and get dependent on the contacts they make through their workplace. You however have the freedom to decide.  Always actively seek out opportunities:   Use meetup (or alike services) to find like-minded people...let it be travellers, DNs, expats, entrepreneurs. Keep your eyes open for foreign language meetings. Check craigslist (if available in your destination) and couchsurfing groups. It's like speed dating for potential friends, but hidden under the cloak (with benefits) of learning a few pieces of another language Try to learn a skill in every place you are...take cooking classes, dancing classes, learn a language in a language center Join a group-fitness based gym (crossfit has a bad reputation and the prices are high, but they heavily focus on group-motivation...plus most of them have monthly packages or at least shorter term contracts than discount gyms.) Join a running group or ask ""strangers"" (for example other people staying at your hostel) to join you for a run, body-weight workout in the park or a game of soccer or alike Devote at least one day of the week to explore a particular sight (could be a 4h stroll through the old part of the town or a hike to mountain XYZ) and never go alone! Always take somebody to get to know along with you. Frequently working from a specific coffee shop? Are you seeing regular customers? Get to know their story. Visit talks (TEDx), maker spaces or university events and art exhibitions...they usually are networking events in disguise Be the connecting hub...if you got to know some of them a bit better (don't want troublemakers) throw a small party at your place, if you are staying in an AirBnb. Keep the size reasonable and state upfront that it is a potluck party and people should bring either food or some drinks. Also make already clear with your invitation that at some point you want to leave your home and move on to explore the city. (Yet alone for the sake of your AirBnBs state and your stuff's safety...you don't want that party to escalate.) It's best to have a very specific evening plan as the goal and deadline to leave. For example: ""At 10:30pm a friend is playing a live gig in bar XYZ."" There is no way around it. You are going, nobody remains in your place. And that's why you've stated it upfront in the invitation :) Of course be a good host, provide some snacks and beers. Make sure you introduce the people you have invited to each other. They'll be thankful for that and return the favor. Trust me. :)  Always follow up. Ask specific people you want to get to know better to join you for lunch, which has the advantage over dinner of being time-wise constricted for most people and won't end in hours of chit-chat. (Unless the latter is your very goal :)) If you are leaving a place and are saying goodbye to people that have become close friends, always make sure that you provide them with an open invitation to visit or join you. Offer them a couch in your AirBnB or ask fellow DNs that you might have learned to trust to share an AirBnB for a more extended period of time.  If you have met locals, try to visit that place again. Maybe schedule a connecting flight with a weekend stay to a place you have stayed before and catch up with some friends.   Cheers :)"

digitalnomad,3d04yz,bananabastard,6,Wed Jul 15 10:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm an introvert for sure, but I have to say I haven't experienced any profound loneliness, I've always been quite happy with solitude.   I meet buddies in most places I go, but I'm happy spending the majority of my time alone.  But now I've found a city I'm very happy to spend the majority of each year in for the foreseeable future, I've made good friends here and met a girl, I'll likely never be as close to my friends here as I am with some of my long time friends from home, but weighing it up, I much prefer living here than my home city.   Also, after I first left home, at any point in my first 4-5 months travelling I could easily have packed it in and returned home, I was enjoying the new experiences but missed the ease and familiarity of life back home. And I wasn't really making any good connections, but eventually I found a place and some people I clicked with.   I think making at least one city a regular semi longterm base is important, it has been for me at least."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,ThemApples007,3,Sun Jul 12 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I should qualify that the only time I experienced loneliness that I would describe as profound was when I was when I fell ill immediately after arriving in a place where I didn't know anybody. I've been lonely at other times, but it's been bearable -- especially because, like you, I am happy with solitude.  Also, I actually just arrived at a place where I spent a month previously, much for the same reasons you note here. I'll see how this next month goes and decide whether I want to make it a semi-permanent base. Thanks!"

digitalnomad,3d04yz,ZoeYellow,2,Wed Jul 15 11:57:16 2015 UTC,"I sympathise entirely with you and know what you mean. I'm not sure it's for me either. The places I'm in are great, but I miss hanging out with those close to me.  It's a question of the ratio of   -energy put in to finding and making new friends, over however long it takes you to reach the point with each of them where no more energy is required  -versus the enjoyment you get from their company during that process and once it is complete.  Some people warm to others immediately and can enjoy the company of people they don't know particularly well, and to them those experiences are worth it in and of themselves, even before a long friendship develops which is even better. Most young travelling types seem to be like this.  For me my ""return on investment"", which sounds horribly cold and mechanical but works as a analogy, is far longer, and meeting people for only a brief amount of time before our paths separate does not result in much social fulfilment at all.  The social groups I'm part of back home have evolved organically over very long periods of time, one of them more than half my entire life, and it's taken a lot of investment from all of us to get to where we are. And by going nomad I'm discarding that, for a series of fleeting encounters with people I'm not invested in and don't have the time to form real friendships with.  So as lucky as I am to be able to do this, and as much as I love the place I'm in right now, I just wish I could bring them too. I'm probably going home fairly soon."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,ThemApples007,2,Sun Jul 12 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"I'm an introvert and traveled for years as an ""analog nomad"" and experienced some of this; I say stick with it, it could work to force you out of your shell a bit.  You'll finally get sick of being alone and will be more proactive to make connections, and you'll learn how to do that.  And when you do want to be alone you can very easily be on your own.  As for intimate connections, sometimes you meet someone you just click with and suddenly feel very close with and so you get it that way.  Or make other DN friends."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,jonez450reloaded,2,Sun Jul 12 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"I think this lifestyle suits introverts better than anyone else, because it involves a large amount of time spent alone. Being introverted allows you to get on with work without distractions instead of searching for your next fix of human interaction.   I've spend a huge amount of time alone in various countries and have never once felt lonely, but I have on many occasions craved solitude especially when staying in guesthouses or places with alot of gung-ho backpackers.  Are you sure you're an introvert? I mean I wouldn't consider myself that introverted and I can go weeks at a time without any social interaction and feel fine."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,curiouscat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that the nomadic lifestyle suits introverts in that regard. I've enjoyed much of the time I've spent in solitude, and it can be a liberating feeling to not be bound by as many social obligations as I was back home.   That's not the aspect of introversion that I feel can be incompatible with this lifestyle. What gets to me is the lack of close, intimate relationships. I'm most in my element in social situations when I'm with close friends. A classic distinction between introverts and extroverts is that extroverts prefer large social gatherings whereas introverts prefer small, intimate ones.   Meeting people through Couchsurfing events, nomad groups, coworking spaces, at bars, etc., and befriending them before leaving a few weeks later is a lot of fun, but it feels like the junk food equivalent of social interaction -- it satisfies the craving, but ultimately, it ends up leaving me unfulfilled.   Do you not find yourself missing close friendships? There are times when all I want is to spend a day with one of my siblings or close friends from back home.  Thanks for your input on this. :)"

I can relate to this. I'm outgoing when I have the energy for it. I can chat it up with strangers at a local social event/gathering and end up at small local house party really easily. I basically just put my game face on and go have fun. People love to talk, especially to travelers. But sometimes I'm not social for a couple months at a time. My girlfriend considers me an introvert because of that, but I do not."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,DoilyTrouble,4,Wed Jul 15 11:10:26 2015 UTC,"On one hand, my social life is vibrant and exciting. I've befriended fellow travelers and locals in each city I've stayed in, had flings with girls, and shared a lot of memorable experiences with others.    I hate to bring tidings of bad news, and point out the obvious, but you're no more an introvert than the people who say OCD when they're not.  As another commenter points out: sounds a lot more like depression to me, and traveling can trigger it, personally I struggled in Tokyo for example because it was so overwhelming and cold, where as I'm writing this from Hiroshima which I'm loving.   I can't offer you a solution, for me it has always been warm weather; Tokyo was cold and wet (yes I know it's summer, it was still cold and wet, rained all but 1 day I was there, and was cold, 19-21c) yet Hiroshima it has been 30-33c during the day, it's like someone hit the happiness on switch :)  Try to find situations and places that repeat the places where you found yourself happy and sociable; that might be weather, environment or something else. Given you have functioned well at times you are capable of working it out."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,just_a_tiny_bit,2,Sun Jul 12 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input and encouragement; I really appreciate it.  I disagree, though, that being able to go out and meet new friends in different cities precludes me from being an introvert. There's a difference between introversion and shyness and/or social anxiety. I'm an introvert in the sense that I ""recharge my batteries"" by being alone, too much time in social settings is draining to me, it takes me a long time to become comfortable with others and open up to them, etc.  Also, I will take some time to reflect on whether it's depression I'm experiencing. I'm inclined to think it's not, as depression is something I've dealt with in the past, and this situation feels different... but I will consider it. Thanks again."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,jonez450reloaded,3,Sun Jul 12 13:40:01 2015 UTC,"Well said.  The introvert term is often used in a much broader and more derogatory way than is useful.    Introverts needn't be incapable of being social and smooth and gregarious.  A useful way to use the term is that introverts are drained interacting with others all day and extroverts are drained being by themselves all day.  Another useful way to look at it is introverts think to themselves first while extroverts like to ""think out-loud""...  Loneliness doesn't seem very correlated to how people self-identify as introvert or extrovert.  Loneliness isn't the same thing as being drained by interacting with people all day.  Extroverts may well feel anxious with much less alone-time than it would take for an introvert to feel anxious.  I think we often have vague understanding of terms that we then conflate and in communication with others muddy the waters.  There are people that say they are introverts when really they are a bit shy and wish they were less social awkward (even when they are not very awkward compared to others).  But those people crave being around others to drawn energy from that and are uncomfortable being alone and are not really introverts at all, but int he vague way the term is used it often means something like this.  There are introverts that have high thresholds for feeling lonely and those with very low thresholds and many in between.  We also tend to equate being too independent from others as a weakness - anti-social etc. (while I tend to think of anti-social as people that lash out at others, not just people that want to be left alone more often than others think is good).  There is a reasonable amount of scientific evidence that social isolation is damaging to health so there is a basis for the general consensus that those who are in too few social relationships are unhealthy.  But people are pretty varied, the point at which limited social interaction being unhealthy medically it seems to me is much less restrictive than the social conventions.  We are social creatures, social bonds are important, but I think we are too quick to apply general rules of thumb to specific situations (and in so doing are not very accurate).  What makes some people lonely would make other people feel smothered with having to deal with too much social interaction.  I traveled a lot and wasn't lonely at all.  And am an introvert (though not a very strong one) - my level of introversion is close to normal.  I think my tolerance for not feeling lonely is fairly extreme.  The question from OP and a fair number of similar ones I see seem to be people that are prone to feeling lonely while they also are not comfortable meeting people all the time and even more feeling close to people you just met.  I do think that combination isn't a great match for nomadic living.  But other advantages of nomadic living may still make it worthwhile.  And then the question become how to work on meeting people and maybe how to work on how to not feel lonely as much.    Feelings of loneliness are not solved by forcing yourself into social situations (I don't think).  But those usually are solved with long term, close friends that you are extremely comfortable with.  For most people that is much easier to achieve when you are geographically near them - so nomadic living is often more difficult.    There are feeling of loneliness (or something similar) that does seem to be solved with just being around others even in a very superficial way.  I am not sure if that is classified as something other than loneliness but I suspect it is (by people that actually know about this stuff).  But in any event that can be solved pretty easily on the nomadic life (doing what many other say here and on similar posts) - even if you are fairly shy and uncomfortable meeting strangers.  If you are very shy then it isn't quite as easy but is doable, it is just more stressful for you."

I'm not trying to make fun of you, but I've known introverts over the years and they always seriously struggle in every social situation, the worst who can never do them at all, the better can force themselves to do one then shut down for a week; there's no do a pile then recharge situation going on.   I do seriously think though you should at least consider that it might be depression, and again, change, particularly when it comes to foreign situations (that doesn't mean foreign countries vs places you're not familiar with) can bring it on."
digitalnomad,3d04yz,tux_greyhat,2,Sun Jul 12 13:45:30 2015 UTC,"they always seriously struggle in every social situation   This is social anxiety, not introversion. Also, that experience you described in a comment below sounds more like social anxiety. Introverts don't necessarily feel uneasy in social situations, we just need more time than more extroverted people to ""recharge."" On the other hand, extroverts get this ""recharging"" from being around people. It's a ridiculously common misconception that, to be an introvert, you must have little to no friends, dislike people, hate socializing, and feel uncomfortable in groups. It just isn't true.  It also isn't helpful that many people view it as black and white classification. I doubt most people are exactly one or the other. Most of us fall in the middle somewhere."

digitalnomad,3d04yz,TheGrinchOfSR,2,Sun Jul 12 14:24:13 2015 UTC,Are you saying that introverts can't have fun social lives or be capable of making friends? All that requires is being able to sniff out parties and fun groups (which often coincide with hostels) and some basic social skills. Introversion is more about energy than how you appear externally and some of us are quite good at faking being extroverts. I see no reason to question the OP's self-knowledge.
digitalnomad,3d04yz,potent_rodent,0,Sun Jul 12 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that as someone when I was young was actually introverted, and that going to one event was a huge deal, and usually involved a shit ton of alcohol to go to + having counseled and helped introverts since (having mostly gotten away from that point...although I still struggle at times) that you're not an introvert if you spend weeks on end socializing in a hostel, then have a down time from that, because no serious introvert can do weeks on end; it's depression, not introversion."

General AirBnD advice - find your ideal listings on AirBnB and then going to the location itself can be a good tactic. You know their daily and monthly price from AirBnB, you can find AirBnB's cut (I don't know it off top of my head) and then you can guess/estimate their room occupancy (% of time, on average, that the room is rented) and make an offer to the owner in person. (AirBnB daily price minus AirBnB fees) X estimated monthly occupancy% should be a reasonable day rate for a month stay. This involves haggling with the owner.  A single night price already takes into account all of those factors (especially % occupied) and you are staying 2-3 months (100% occupancy). In Asia a listing on AirBnB for $20 a night should/can be gotten for $10 a night on a month stay prepaid in advance. And I assume even lower.  Best of luck!"

digitalnomad,3cy2t0,ruspow,4,Sat Jul 11 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"Pro-tip: If you are a wet shaver, bring your own blades...I found them to be 2-3x as expensive in Asia.  Besides that everything else (clothing, toiletries, accessories) can be purchased there with ease. Yes, that means you should only bring the good clothes that you already have and ditch the ""(sleep) shirt you won in some raffle 3 years ago"". One exception for Asia, though: If you are a large fella, you better bring your own clothes...I'm a ""size medium"" guy in Europe and sometimes had a tough time finding clothes that would fit and they mostly already were labeled ""XL"" in Asia. It's by no means not impossible, but it will take a few days and cause some inconvenience.   But still the theme should be to heavily prioritize on what you put in your bags and keeping it light.  For toiletries I'd only bring Dr. Bronner's magic soap peppermint (works for hair, body, as emergency toothpaste and foamed up as shaving lotion), said wet shaver + blades, a disposable toothbrush for the flight and first days and my hair clippers + small mirror.   Don't bring a plate, bowl or cup or anything alike (except maybe a quality knife or multitool). Go to some street market (district) and get them cheaply.   What is important for me:   Basic clothing for the purpose of the stay Quality backpack Quality daybag / messenger bag power plug converter + multi-power strip smartphone + charger + cable quality in-ear headphones camera + lenses + charger + sd cards + accessories (gorillapod...) laptop + charger external storage expansion drive (2TB) (kept in carry-on bag during flight) external backup drive (4TB), backs up storage drive + notebook (kept in check-in backpack, if one is lost, one copy of the data remains in my hands...keep at least another copy at home or in the cloud) usb drive (on my keychain) containing copies of ""important documents"" my trusted external batterypack ebook reader notebook + pen (or, what I prefer...just a bunch of A4 sheets in a clear plastic folder, because you can get paper everywhere and that makes it easy to be scanned) running shoes + BT heart rate monitor strap + a set of exercise clothes (I wear swim shorts for my workouts, so I don't have to bring extra swimwear)   Documents:    passport necessary visa for your stay international driver's license credit and debit cards TAN-list as a fall-back for online banking (or keep a digital copy, safely encrypted), if pushTAN fails or the TAN-generating device, if required by your bank health insurance card (travel) insurance documents worst case prep: printed copy of your booking confirmation of your first night's stay + address only digital: copies of some of the expensive hardware, such as notebook or camera gear, to prove that you didn't purchase it oversea and won't have trouble with customs when returning   Carry on special items or things to do:   On flights longer than 5h I'll wear my running compression tights underneath my pants, which helps tremendously with coping with the impact of sitting for too long. I'll bring a sweater which serves well enough as a make shift travel pillow, if you tuck it in itself and shape it a bit. 3d sleeping mask, which doesn't press onto the eyes I make sure to have one set of fresh underwear and a spare shirt in my carry on. If my check-in bag gets lost, I'll at least have enough clothing for the first jet-lagged day. If my bag arrives (which it usually does), I change into the fresh clothing upon arrival in the airport's bathroom. Nothing better than feeling refreshed after a long trip.

digitalnomad,3cy2t0,streletz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:42:57 2015 UTC,"Good lists!  I have a different plan, when ""home"".   I have two suitcases open, and everything I use has to fit inside these. (Two suitcases is quite a lot, so it's not that difficult.)  Things I use most go into my newer suitcase. When I leave, the newer suitcase comes with me.   The older suitcase gets zipped up, and can be sent to me if I ask for it, say when I'm settled.   Everything else (kitchenware, books, magazines etc) gets given away.   My carry on bag has everything I'll need on the flight, plus my laptop."

I've purged my wardrobe of the color since, and maybe never going black again.  Also, not many Japanese wear sunglasses, hats, or the hood part of a jacket, even in rain or cold.  These will get you stared at. They prefer to mess with umbrellas instead of water resistant clothing."
digitalnomad,3cxfdl,trym3r,3,Sat Jul 11 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"We lived in Koh Lanta for a month and had a membership at KoHub the entire time. The island is a good home base - quiet, friendly, nice beaches, etc. That can be said of most islands, but I think I like the quiet atmosphere of Koh Lanta in particular.  KoHub has everything you need. The best internet connection on the island (though it can get a little slow when everyone is on it). Their smoothies are great, and their daily lunches are amazing + a great way to meet other nomads.   There are some fun Western and Thai bars on the island, decent number of gyms, and places to hang out and party if you're into that. I recommend staying on Relax Bay and getting a moped to get to KoHub - it's just a tiny little bay with a sweet beach. It was one of my favorite spots on the island. I also like the South end of the island, but that's a little far from KoHub.  I wouldn't worry about the weather. They call it ""green season."" Everything is cheaper, and the rain isn't even that bad. Intermittent. Weather is still great."
digitalnomad,3cxfdl,awesomeflyinghamster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:06:49 2015 UTC,"You mean Relax Bay Resort? A bit too pricey for me unfortunately.  So it's not true that Koh Lanta is practically dead in October and only comes to life in November? Also, do you think staying there for 3 months may be a bit too long? As in I would get bored after some time."
digitalnomad,3cxfdl,awesomeflyinghamster,2,Sun Jul 12 11:31:22 2015 UTC,"Nope, just that area - Relax Bay is the name of the little bay. I've heard the resort is nice, but like you said, wayy too expensive for most nomads.  We stayed at a little bungalow nearby Relax Bay, Banh Sita. There are bungalows all over the island, so no matter where you want to live, you'll find a place nearby.  So, while I haven't been in October, the whole idea of 'off-season' was a pretty hot topic. The people who stay there year-round were very adamant that the 'rainy season' was really just 'green season.' Yes, there's more rain, but it comes intermittently. It's not shitty weather all day every day by any means. Just means there's more greenery and some nice thunderstorms here and there. I believe them - that sounds like island weather to me.   Biggest difference is the tourist flood dies out, so places are much much cheaper and less crowded. I wish we had gone during off-season, myself. That sounds great to me.   I think staying 3 months is a bit too long if you're not into diving. And even then, you'd have to be really into diving. Island = sand, water, and not much else. Food is OK, but it's harder to get ingredients, so it's not the best food in Thailand IMO. You could explore most of the interesting spots and get a great feel for the entire island in 1 month for sure.  That said, I did meet people who had been there months and were totally happy. Most of these people were big into diving, though."

digitalnomad,3cqwlm,cwood74,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:43:20 2015 UTC,"True, but isn't currency just kind of a concept? It's all relative. What is it that makes one stronger than another?  I was just in Bulgaria for example (who BTW are on the Leva). Some people there were holding events to get people to back converting to the Euro. I strongly disagree, and so did some of my Bulgarian friends (but not all). If Bulgaria (who is wonderfully cheap for us) goes to the Euro, I feel they'd be screwed. Bulgarian people don't earn much (I think they mentioned they get about the equivalent of $500 a month on average), which is why I think many of them want to go to the Euro, but if they did, I feel like prices would rise and salaries would rise at a slower rate, which would be horrible for them. At least for the first few years depending on how they manage it."
digitalnomad,3cqwlm,cwood74,3,Fri Jul 10 03:15:59 2015 UTC,Even with one currency you can compare cost of living in different areas of the US. 100k a year in the Midwest is rich while in a major city it's barley middle class.
digitalnomad,3cqwlm,Some_Videotapes,2,Fri Jul 10 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"What makes one stronger than another is what you can buy with each currency and the demand for the currency.  This is usually based on the price indexes of the countries that use the currency. About Bulgaria's conversion to the euro, I don't know to much about the country, but if you export a lot to Europe, it would be smart to switch, because this would increase exports a whole bunch, bringing the economy up with it."
digitalnomad,3cqwlm,ill_mango,2,Fri Jul 10 03:47:19 2015 UTC,"Do you have any reason for ""feeling"" like prices would rise as a result of joining the euro?   To answer your question earlier: Currency strength relative to other currencies is usually based on the production of the region that uses that currency.  A simple example: let's say I live in Canada, and I sell wood to the rest of the world.  Not only do I have tons of wood, by my wood is the best quality.  So Canadian wood is quite popular.  If a ship-maker in Malta wants to buy some Canadian wood, they need Canadian dollars.  They must convert their money into Canadian money.  This increases the demand for Canadian currency relative to Maltese currency, so the strength of the Canadian dollar goes up relative to the Maltese currency.  There are other ways to affect the strength of currencies, for instance interest rates and being the ""de-facto"" world currency, but I won't get into that here.  To answer your posts questions: yes, some countries will ALWAYS be more or less expensive than others.  If country A has a lot of arable land, and country B does not, then the cost of food will be higher in the country B.  If country A has lots of space for housing, and country B does not, then the cost of housing will be higher in country B.  Please note that the costs of globalization are quite high.  It takes more fuel/fixed cost/labour to send food all the way around the world than it does to grow them locally (in most cases).  The world is not homogeneous either - different countries have different resources, and that effects the prices.  Anyways, this is turning into a wall of text, so just let me know if you have questions."

As far as security, the Farpoint has a great locking system for the main bag and the straps keep the backpack snug so that it would be difficult to pilfer.

digitalnomad,3cq483,TheStephinator,2,Thu Jul 9 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth it to go for top-end packs, in non-flashy colors.  My last two packs have been Mammut Nirvana Pro 35L.  The first one I had was in navy blue, and the one I have currently is in black.  They are very well constructed, and not overly flashy.  Another approach I've used before is to get high-end packs in black, and then use a sharpie marker to black out the logos.  That said, I like Osprey's wheeled cases.  I've owned a Meridian and an Ozone, and have been pleased with both.  Military-style packs are another option to consider.

The Philippines REQUIRES Philippines nationals to have a flight back into the Philippines if they're leaving. Not an onward ticket to their next destination...an actual return ticket! Ugh...

digitalnomad,3cnnjk,chrisburdick,2,Thu Jul 9 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth Expedia offers a 24+ hour cancellation. I've used that a few times. I buy a ticket before hitting the airport. Once I arrived and cleared immigration, I'd cancel it. It takes them a few days to process the refund back into the account but it's zero cost."
digitalnomad,3cnnjk,BrechtVds,3,Thu Jul 9 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"I used to buy tickets from Expedia but they do not have that policy for all the airlines. I booked a KLM ticket and they stated it's refundable, but when I booked a Singapore airlines ticket they didn't state the same. Anyhow, it wastes you some time to find a ticket and wait for the refund to come back to your account while you could use it to invest for other things."
digitalnomad,3cnnjk,djmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about a refundable tickets.  The process is simple, buy a ticket, cancel within 24 hours and you are out no money.

I just don't know how sustainable that $10 rate is. I'd pay up to $20 or so."

digitalnomad,3cnnjk,djmc,5,Thu Jul 9 09:57:23 2015 UTC,"Another reason - sometimes you're dealing with not only the airline but also immigration. While it's never happened to me, I'd hate to have an immigration offer check into it and find out I was lying to them with a faked ticket."
digitalnomad,3cnnjk,djmc,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:51:30 2015 UTC,immigration gives you a chance to buy an onward ticket if you don't have one.  Are you afraid they're gonna permanently bar you from entering the country or put you in jail?

I guess being barred or put in jail are the WORST options, but there are others I wouldn't appreciate:  A) Hold me for questioning for 1, 2, 3+ hours B) Forcing me to buy a ridiculously expensive onward ticket I wouldn't use C) Marking me for additional scrutiny on future visits"

digitalnomad,3cnnjk,traveler19395,0,Fri Jul 10 12:28:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah it works sometimes as I've heard. I've personally never done that before which is printing out a fake ticket, because I sometimes get checked by the airlines when I check in, they ask to see my onward ticket then check the code on the websites of the airlines to make sure it's valid. Nowadays, the ""Manage My Booking"" page on every website of the carriers makes it easy for them to track the info by just entering your name and booking code, so if you want to bypass it, you need a real ticket with a real booking code. Also, the airlines update their e-ticket templates frequently so they would know if you are using an outdated template. I don't want to risk it."

But you're absolutely playing with fire here, and your host agency (assuming you're not ARC here) is, too, I presume with even greater stakes.  I've spent 30 years in the travel industry, working with the GDS systems, ARC, and IATA, as well as owning a retail agency and fighting more than a few Debit Memos in my time.  I'm not sure your liability insurance would cover this, as its clearly fraudulent activity to sell a ticket for the sole purpose of processing a refund later.  Years ago when tickets could be endorsed and refunded for cash, your method of issuing and voiding or refunding tickets was a common way to launder money internationally.  Might I suggest that you compile a database of carriers which offer 24 hour courtesy refunds around the world, a selection of routes they fly from the most common DN countries, and/or the procedures on how to purchase a Y or F ticket and how to get it refunded, and teach people how to create their own false tickets?  If you're only charging $5-$10 now, I'd hope people would be willing to chip in that much to access that info and perhaps your support expertise via email."
digitalnomad,3cnnjk,Barflyerdammit,4,Thu Jul 9 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I actually made a counter on the site to show how many tickets available/left for the day, and I limit it to a maximum of 200 tickets per day for now, I might increase or decrease it later if the agency requests. The agency claims and impresses me that they sell out averagely 700 tickets per day so I think the mix would be fine. And yes they are not booking and voiding tickets from only one carrier, they do it with others as well (we have a list of carriers on the site), they also affiliate with other agencies, so those tickets won't come out from only one agency account to low down the risk. They know how to manage it. To be honest, I don't think the demand would be that much for me to worry, I only hope to have 10 customers per day so I can have more funds to fuel up my trips and continue with my nomadic lifestyle, and think of more ideas to help other nomads."

We ended up with a 36 ft Fifth wheel with three slides, so it's more like a small house, but we need a much larger truck to pull it.

Whenever someone is on you about compliance of some sort, be relaxed, and provide them with more information than they need.    When asked by immigration, I usually pick one of my clients and give a mildly technical summary of their product.  For example, ""I work with a San Francisco-based startup that makes an automated reliability and performance testing tool for enterprise software teams.""  For most immigration officers, this is more technical depth than they need to assess your situation.  Also, be sure to dress nicely when going through passport control.  With that, you are less likely to get asked questions about how you can support yourself.  I was only asked about that once when entering Germany, and on that occasion, I was in a T-shirt and cargos."

The fact that I have a computer with me doesn't change the economic impact on the country I'm visiting.  I also have a big emergency fund now. Just in case I need to prove I can support myself.

If I'm traveling with someone - a friend or lady or girlfriend or whatever, usually AirBnB is the way to go.  Depends on your style. I'm very social and love meeting new people. Not everyone is. Wifi is a convern so I always look for that no matter what kind of place it is.

The sample rates I've pulled up for various places were not cheaper than the best hotels rates.  If they were cheaper, it usually came dome to location... Keep in mind that many businesses are on AirBNB and it's not just average Joes renting out their pads.  Hostels?  I'm too old to sleep 5 to a room in a dirty room and use some nasty shared bathroom.  I've yet to see a hostel that is really nice and pleasant.  I don't doubt that they're out there, but every time I end up in a hostel, it's crap.  With people glued to their laptops/tablets/skype/smartphones, it's usually not that social, either.  I'm just barely old enough to remember what people did in hostels before they started to spend their time Skyping mom and texting friends back home.  Wifi is always hit or miss.  It depend on the exact room you get, how congested it is that day, etc.  I've had to ask staff to restart their routers, for example.  It's pointless to read online reviews for ""good wifi"".

Definitely a bank to do due diligence on if you're looking for liquidity.  Now, a quick but important lesson in APR vs APY:  This is an offer with a 1% APY. In other words, you earn 1% over a year if your daily balance if over $2500. The APR is actually closer to 0.995%. A small difference, naturally, but an important distinction when discussing interest rates.  Additionally:   Annual Percentage Yield (APY) accurate as of 6/30/15. Minimum amount to open account is $10.00. Rate tiers are as follows: 0.25% APY applies to balances of $0.01—$2,499.99, and 1.00% APY applies to the entire balance on balances of $2,500 or more. Rates may change after account is opened. Fees may reduce earnings.   If you're someone who keeps a daily balance of over $2500 in your checking account, this is a solid deal."

digitalnomad,3cknp0,dailytentacle,2,Thu Jul 9 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"We use their savings account with an ATM card. Checking account you needed a brokerage account, savings you don't... and hitting ATM doesn't count against the limit on withdrawals from savings so it acts like a high yield checking account.  Obviously wouldn't work for paying lots of bills etc. but for travel ATM the Schwab savings account is great."

I've only had it a few months so haven't done a solid analysis, but I've made withdrawals in multiple countries and had fees deposited back at the end of the month. One roadblock I ran into was that money isn't available to use until ~five days after a bank transfer completed, so I have to fund it from my main account well in advance of needing it."
digitalnomad,3cknp0,jacalata,2,Thu Jul 9 06:41:31 2015 UTC,"Yes... for foreign ATM withdrawals it's the 1% foreign currency fee that I'd like to avoid. I believe it's a Visa fee though, so maybe no way to avoid that one."

digitalnomad,3cn6zv,mike4855,2,Thu Jul 9 05:20:54 2015 UTC,"In regards to the Taxes question, for accurate responses you'll probably also have to ask where they are from, which citizenships and residencies they hold, how they structure their affairs, and in what jurisdictions.  For example, a US Citizen, self-employed and working in Thailand will have a very different tax situation to an Australian Citizen who is a Panamanian Resident, through a Hong Kong Corporation and working from Germany.  For me, based in the UK as sole Director of a UK company providing business coaching and consulting services, I had to pay Corporations Tax and was registered for the VAT under the flat rate scheme; I also had personal Income Tax in the UK plus VAT expenses; Income Tax paid was off-set against Taxes owing in Australia (where I am also a citizen, remained a resident for tax purposes, and earned some work income through my Australian company and an investment property).  Wow - I'm really over-thinking this aren't I?!"
digitalnomad,3cn6zv,JacobAldridge,0,Fri Jul 10 04:46:07 2015 UTC,Ok I was just wondering about the FEI exemption in the US. Do you know anything about how that works? Or is there something similar where you are from? For example if an American DN making up to 100k working in Thailand does not have to pay any taxes to the US is it possible to get by without paying any taxes at all?
digitalnomad,3cn6zv,JacobAldridge,2,Fri Jul 10 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert. As I understand it, the USA and Eritrea are the only 2 countries in the world that tax citizens on worldwide income, regardless of residency and income source.   This can create banking dilemmas for DNs - if you're a US-Citizen it can mean extra compliance, and some banks couldn't be bothered. Definitely worth searching in this sub as I've seen US Accountants explain the nuances ."

digitalnomad,3cn6zv,average_chap,2,Tue Jul 14 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"In the UK we have a ""residency test"" which determines whether you are a UK taxpayer based on how many days you have been IN the UK during the previous 12 months. I do the accounting of a bunch of DN's after setting living as one in Chiang Mai, Thailand last year. It can be complicated but for the UK it all boils down to long term planning. It sounds sexy to say you don't pay taxes because you have a business setup in Panama, but in the UK what that means is that you are not paying National Insurance, which means you aren't paying towards your pension, you won't get tax credits, childcare credits or unemployment benefits incase you ever need them. You will have to ""top-up"" you contributions.  When I have this conversation along with explaining all of the tax reliefs available by doing your accounts properly, there is next to no point f'ing about with offshore accounts. It's just something to chat up girls with.  When you earn a considerable amount, like £75k+ then I'd set one up, maybe. But as most DN's are bootstrapping and making a good enough wage to keep them from the 9-5, it's just not worth it.  Completely different for US citizens, for you, it sucks. Messed up system that taxes you twice."

IANAL but the only restriction I'm aware of as a foreign owned business is that your business can not purchase land in Cambodia.  That isn't to say starting a business in Cambodia is easy. There are a series of bribes and there's a lot of paperwork to file. There's some legal hoops to jump through, depending on which ministries are involved I understand they can be annoying, but a 100% foreign-owned LLC is totally an option."

Setting up a company as a foreigner in Thailand is a nightmare, I'd look at Cambodia, although corruption is a problem they're far more open to foreign investment."
digitalnomad,3cjv50,SearchingTheDark,2,Thu Jul 9 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, i was putting Thailand as my no.1 option, this comment just suddenly made it sound so unattractive. Now I am wondering how bad the corruption could be in Cambodia. I was in Cambodia for about two weeks in 2014，although nothing bad happened to me, it gave me an unsafe vibe, i witnessed one bag-grabbing robbery on the street in PhnomPhen and also met a Taiwanese girl who got mugged in Sihanoukville and lost all her valuables."
digitalnomad,3cjv50,slevin4k,2,Thu Jul 9 06:39:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't find Cambodia particularly unsafe - but I'm biased as it's the place I'll probably retire to when I eventually settle down from the nomadic lifestyle.   Sihanoukville is a shithole (thanks to the types of tourists it attracts), Phnom Penh like any major city is hit or miss. Siem Reap is safe, relatively clean, and quite international.   As for corruption - all of Cambodia suffers from one shared trait. It's poor. Disgustingly poor. Government officials barely draw a salary, taxes are rarely collected, the average Cambodian in Phnom Penh makes $100/month. The average Cambodian nationwide makes far less than that.  So if you have to pay some tea money to start a business, that's just the cost of doing business. If you need to put forward a small bribe to get a police report? That's just the cost of needing the police here. It's corruption, yes, but whether or not it bothers you/is a real problem is up to a matter of perspective.  As far as violence goes, this isn't Central/South America. Cambodia is basically as safe as anywhere in SEA, you just can't count on justice stepping in when things go wrong, because it probably won't."

digitalnomad,3ch811,biririri,14,Tue Jul 7 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"Node.js is weird, moves fast, and there aren't that much of consolidated practices. It's not so good for junior devs.  PHP is a huge market, the barrier for entrance is low and there are a lot of projects good for junior developers.  MongoDB looks very simple, but in practice is quite complex. When you move past the basics things get ugly. There aren't many solid ORMs for it, mongoose solves a lot of problems but creates a lot of other ones.  MySQL/PostgreSQL looks complex, but in practice is very simple cause the ORMs abstract a ton of complexity away.  Angular is great and there's a huge ecosystem around it. The market for it is good and you can find jobs, but if you don't go full js on your path, it's probably way too much effort.  My opinion: if you want to ramp up quickly and start making some money study PHP (Wordpress and pick a MVC framework) and some simple javascript (pure js and some jQuery). It will be easier to find starting gigs, and it's more fit to junior developers.  MEAN is overhyped. Also, it's too complex for a developer to be getting remote jobs on it in 9 months of study. The PHP ecosystem is way simpler and the market is a lot larger. Writing and fixing up Wordpress templates is not sexy, but pays the bills and are a good way to start into development.  Source: I started with PHP 8 years ago. Nowadays I'm doing MEAN (well, actually with Ember instead of Angular)."

There's also Symphony, which is common. But all these MVC frameworks are more or less the same and the knowledge is easily transferable. In your place, I would choose based on documentation. Take a look around and see which of them you can get better guides/tutorials and learning material. The code itself is very similar.  Another option you may want to consider, due to your marketing background, is studying Magento. Magento is used a lot to power ecommerce. It's a very complex system, but you could use you marketing background as a differential when trying to get jobs. This is just a random idea, I don't really know if that would really help."

Here's what I recommend -- don't worry about the total number of tourists, instead try to find a place that doesn't exist/survive solely for tourism. In other words, you probably want a bigger beach city with some sort of local industry that supports the need for fast internet. Perhaps Penang in Malaysia? Or maybe Cebu in the Philippines?

The internet speeds aren't bad either.  About the suggestion of Cebu, I'd say no. There aren't any decent clean beaches in the city so you need to schlep to the beaches. If you get close to the beaches, you lose decent internet speeds, beaches and closeness to shopping, etc. My experience is a bit dated but I found the cost of living to be higher in Cebu than Penang.

I don't tend to take on short term contracts (my current one has been running for almost 2.5 years). So yes, in my case it's long term contract work for a single customer.  But the same is true for when you're doing short term contracts. You're responsible for all your own expenses, so your hourly rate is naturally higher.  Take your hourly rate you'd get as an employee and multiply that by roughly 1.6, and that'll give you a guesstimate of what hourly rate you should charge doing short term contract work.  For longer term contracts you'll need to negotiate weekly or monthly rates rather than hourly.  Edit: Here's some deeper discussion of how to set contract rates. I've only skimmed that page, so it might be full of shit. But it looked like the right points were being made..."

digitalnomad,3cdcbd,fr1endlyf1re,9,Tue Jul 7 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"""Programmers"" is a broad term that includes web devs and software engineers [at least colloquially speaking].  If you can program efficiently and are at a truly top tier school, then it doesnt really matter your focus as market rates for almost any form of true programming will support a DN lifestyle.  Adding a Cisco certification doesn't make much sense in that regard.  It could be helpful to learn how to deploy and manage an app on AWS, but not really necessary.  Instead of worrying about learning other skills, you should focus on the business side of freelancing/consulting that helps you charge what you're worth instead of scraping by with Elance jobs.  Make sure you are doing well in your classes and staying on top of things, but learning how to sell yourself will be by far the most valuable skill you can come away with from school."

Through their networks, bolstered by coworking spaces, DNs will be able to rapidly assemble into highly specialized teams, form joint ventures, and bid on and execute increasingly larger projects. The flexible nature of such teams and hopefully their enthusiasm will likely be huge advantages over lumbering corporations with their generally stifling culture and baggage. DN teams will be able to set up shop in nearly any country very quickly and dissolve when the job is done.  Your reputation (i.e., personal ""brand"") will be everything, so slackers, moochers, and the incompetent will quickly be weeded out.   Interpersonal collaboration and cooperation will be more important than competition."

digitalnomad,3cd395,sobri909,3,Tue Jul 7 05:13:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, I expect the tax and visa issues surrounding ""remote work"" to become more formalized in the future. Most digital nomads today are staying under the radar, entering on tourist visas, and doing visa runs to stay in the country for long durations. This definitely won't last. Perhaps there will be a ""remote worker"" type visa in the future, that allows you to stay longer than a tourist visa, in exchange for paying some sort of tax or fees to the local government."

digitalnomad,3cd395,sobri909,0,Tue Jul 7 12:01:43 2015 UTC,"I think already a lot of supposed ""nomads"" are not living nomadically. They're doing visa runs 4+ times a year to allow them to stay in the same country.  Though last time I brought this up it started a nasty argument about whether people who're spending a whole year in one place are really nomads or not.  I said they're not, but others got defensive. So let's not go there again. If you're staying that long and you want to call yourself a nomad, do whatever makes you happy. shrug"

digitalnomad,3cd395,AlternativeZone1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:15:14 2015 UTC,Exactly. Most digital nomads aren't very nomadic. They're just ppl who plopped down to leech off a country with a cheap cost of living.
digitalnomad,3cd395,curiouscat,4,Wed Jul 8 05:03:57 2015 UTC,"I am sure most all the countries with cheap costs of living love the foreign currency digital nomads bring.  Sure the more those nomads spend the better - so most shoestring nomads don't bring a lot of benefit to the countries but those that spend even $1,000 a month in places like Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines  are very valuable resources those countries would love to attract more of.  For those countries getting in foreign currency is hugely important, especially as fears rise given the whole Greek drama and other economic worries are increasing.  Other than creating good jobs in their country bringing in foreign currency is about the most important thing for any of these low income countries.  The digital nomads benefits from a cheap standard of living but the countries benefit more (of course what the heck does ""more"" mean here - it is just my opinion on the relative value)."
digitalnomad,3cd395,AlternativeZone1,-3,Tue Jul 7 07:49:33 2015 UTC,Heh are you serious? Very valuable resources.. You guys are so full of yourselves. DNs aren't even on the economic radar for any of those countries you've mentioned haha. How delusional dude. You're telling me you expect to see international marketing campaigns aimed at DNs the way countries advertise to 2-week vacationers? Or you expect special visas and retirement programs like they offer to expats over 50? Are you kidding me? Countries appreciate just about every other expat niche including backpackers probably more than DNs. DNs just dont have the numbers.   Not to mention you're just talking tourism. Yet you suddenly factor in the greek crisis or perhaps u wanna talk about the russian economy collapsing? That just dilutes your argument even further when you realize how small an economic force DNs are to counter issues like that.
digitalnomad,3cbqcg,mike4855,8,Mon Jul 6 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"What advice would you have for someone looking to do the same thing?   Starting two things at once is more difficult than one. Trying to learn how to travel and work remotely and learning to freelance at the same time is going to be more difficult than staying in one place and building a freelance business. We can pretend human relationships don't matter, but the reality any good freelancer will tell you is that those relationships matter a lot. And it's much easier to develop them locally.  What challenges will a newcomer definitely run into?   Work comes and goes. Or doesn't come if you're just starting out. You're going to spend a lot more time trying to find clients you hate and get underpaid and you will need to over-deliver because you've got nothing else. All in the hopes that you get paid fully and maybe get a recommendation to work on something better.  What kind of experience will I need before I start freelancing?   Experience convincing people you can actually deliver what they want. And then following through. If you manage to do that, you're ahead of the curve.  Where do you find work?   Almost all referrals and inbound requests.  At what point did you feel confident enough to become a DM doing this?  I don't. I spend 4-5 months of the year traveling and the rest at home where the majority of my work comes from. Getting a project or two and traveling for some months works fine though because I do come back and keep those relationships maintained."

digitalnomad,3cbqcg,KingOfDaCastle,9,Tue Jul 7 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"What advice would you have for someone looking to do the same thing?   Get a few solid clients that cover the minimums before you go. Ideally someone on a retainer. So that at least you have some base and you don't need to take every shitty thing thrown at you. Because if you do that, you'll get stuck in that loop of doing a bunch of small, shitty jobs to get by, rather than interesting large projects.   What challenges will a newcomer definitely run into?    Internet speeds. Equipment theft (make sure to have cloud backup, as well as local backup of everything). Relocation it time consuming, so time accordingly. Don't travel when the deadline is looming.    What kind of experience will I need before I start freelancing?   Solid professional experience with a portfolio to show.   Where did you start and how did you get to where you are today?   I started a long time ago, before digital nomadism was popular. So I guess this is not really applicable to me.   How much do you make now, and where do you find work?   Same as above.   At what point did you feel confident enough to become a DM doing this?   I worked locally from home for a while, like a few years, before I went traveling. It wasn't because I didn't feel confident about doing work remotely. It was mostly due to other issues."

digitalnomad,3cbqcg,moltar,12,Tue Jul 7 14:15:49 2015 UTC,"I started out my digital nomad existence as a web developer, but quickly changed course and started an infosec consulting firm. The skills aren't quite the same, but the experience has a ton of crossover.   I used Elance to begin with, and started from a profile with zero experience. Keep in mind I have a B.A. in politics from a small liberal arts college, not a computer science or business degree. I just kept applying, and kept myself on the 'fake it till you make it' knife-edge of challenging yourself vs. overselling yourself. I found several very niche jobs (IDS sensors on Rapsberry Pis, etc.,), and once I had a few good reviews from these jobs, I branched out towards the opportunities that really interested me.   I just got back from a year traveling Central America, running my business and working contracts the entire time. I wouldn't say I was confident at first -- it was more like I just knew I could eventually handle anything thrown my way, and that the best way to test the viability of the DN lifestyle that so enthralled me was to simply jump in and live it full time."

digitalnomad,3cbqcg,imacarpet,2,Tue Jul 7 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"I got into infosec because I watched Ghost In The Shell one too many times... Or maybe it was all the books I read. Either way, I think I was drawn in by the esotericism of computer and network security, since it's something not a lot of people understand and it is vital in our everyday existence. You can kind of look like it as magick, in the sense of being able to manipulate things in ways that other people don't understand. It's arcane.  It's a challenge, and it's always changing.   Also, I was bored in a lot of my college courses, so I would often tune out of the discussions and just read infosec blogs or magazines like Phrack or POC||GTFO."
digitalnomad,3cbqcg,spiraled_one,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:38 2015 UTC,Funny you should say that. Cos one of the things I was interested in before I got deep into computers was esotericism. A lot of my academic work was around that.
digitalnomad,3cbqcg,imacarpet,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"I think it provides an outlet for the same sort of motivations: a continual quest for knowledge, the will to know more, the tendency to shift among and break out of paradigms... We could talk for hours about the aesthetic crossovers too: the 'hacker' figure, a pariah, numbers and symbols and text, etc.   Can you tell me more about your academic work?"
digitalnomad,3cbqcg,spiraled_one,2,Fri Jul 10 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"I had a good amount of experience before the company I was working for shut down and I got tired of applying for office jobs I knew I'd hate and decided to just freelance and travel. It was still hard as hell to get decent work without having many contacts though. So my first and foremost advice.. try to network and have references / work experience BEFORE leaving, and be prepared to spend a lot of time searching for clients, dealing with shitty clients and making damn sure you don't lose the good ones when you find them. I spent much more time finding work and talking with clients than I did actually doing the work while freelancing.  A lot more companies these days are willing to hire regular remote workers. Unless you have a lot of contacts and don't mind dealing with clients on your own time, I'd recommend trying to get one of those jobs. Way, way less headache and stress when you have regular payments. Your earnings can be higher if freelancing on your own but often after all the non-billable time you spend your actual per hour earnings are pretty low.   Other tips might be more relevant depending on where you are planning to travel. I went to Central America and was in a tourist area but was still surprised at how often the internet and lights went out and how slow everything was. Having clients who didn't mind me not responding immediately to every little thing was important, and learning discipline to get your work done when you can because there is no assurance you will be able to later. Discipline in general will be very important when you are working remote and traveling.  On retrospect, while I had the experience as a developer I did not have the experience dealing with clients that I should have had before setting out. I lost good clients because I didn't give their work and communicating with them the priority it needed, and got burned by a lot of bad clients because I ignored warning signs because I needed the money, even though doing work that I didn't get paid for just put me further in the hole. I didn't force clients into signing contracts to protect myself because I was afraid of scaring them away.. always get a contract. If asking them to sign a contract scares them away you just saved yourself a lot of headache.   How much experience do you need? Look at a job board and see what kind of work people are asking for. If you can do it, you are fine. But again, your skill at dealing with people is more important than your skill as a web developer. It doesn't take much effort to learn Wordpress and then do wordpress based websites all day long (as an example). Once you have that baseline, what differentiates you between the other fellow bidding on a contract is how comfortable the client is working with you.   I first moved from the US and started freelancing fulltime about 6 years ago. Today I work remotely for a startup with very small bits of freelancing on the side. I miss the variety of projects freelancing brought me am happy I can fix more on actually developing than client management. I make way less than I could in a regular job at one of the big tech centers but to me the lifestyle is worth it."

digitalnomad,3cbyij,2QuestionsDaily,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:04:01 2015 UTC,I've quickly moved from affiliate marketing to eccomerce and drop shipping because you can get better margins and obtain more control which for me is working out much better (and I would recommend the same for others thinking about affiliate marketing) but I did make a few niche sites that don't make me very much - somewhere between $50-100 a month

It will give you a shitload of miles, plus it waives that minimum spend requirement for Delta's Medallion statuses if you buy enough on the card each year.   My main card is the Chase Sapphire Preferred. No transaction fees or conversion fees for using it abroad, which is critical. (The Amex has this, too.)  For banking, check out Schwab. They have a checking account that will reimburse ATM fees, and there are no branches anywhere, so it's all online.   So far I've had no problems at all dealing with all-online existence.   FreshBooks is great for accounting prep. It'll do all your bookkeeping as well as invoicing. It even does the Mint-style auto-import of expenses.   This setup has worked for me across three continents (so far) without issues.   Regarding accountants, the good ones are expensive. Depending on your business setup, you may be able to do most of it yourself. If you're willing to spend the money, I've seen anywhere from $1–5k/year to manage accounts remotely.

digitalnomad,3cbuks,wilds94,5,Mon Jul 6 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"I've been on elance for maybe a year now. I've gotten a decent amount of transcribing work which seems to me like the easiest to get without specific experience or example of work to show. It doesn't pay well but it was worth doing in my spare time to make some extra money. I probably averaged like $4usd per hour (1 audio minute takes me about 3 minutes to complete: one listen through typing as fast as I can go with audio speed at 0.7x, rushing through spell check fixing all my typos then another run through at 1.4x fixing all my mistakes). Not great but worth it to me.   I also got a job writing 500 word articles. 10 a week that paid me $30 for all 10. I went for awhile and then the person who hired me was told to quit that process for whatever reason. Maybe I sucked and she was being nice. It would take about 30 mins to write one article so that would be about $6usd per hour.   Haven't checked on upwork yet so I can't say anything about that. However it does take a little while and bidding for a lot of jobs since you start with zero reviews on your account. Now I get them a bit more often and they pay is slightly better but not a big improvement by any means. I certainly couldn't live on what I made and if I had to transcribe that much I would go insane. There are a ton of other jobs if you have other qualifications so your experience could be very different."

This sounds pretty decent, I can imagine that hopefully after I spent some time on upwork and get some decent reviews I might be able to do ok. My goal is to earn roughly 20-25usd an hour in a year or two.   It's not hard to dream big with the few success stories about these online freelance sites.

I have a credit card and a debit card in my wallet, but then in my luggage I keep another credit card and another debit card. They're all for different banks, so I'd have to shuffle money round if my wallet got stolen, but I'd still survive."
digitalnomad,3c06es,TheStephinator,5,Sat Jul 4 11:08:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that. :(  I use 1Password with Dropbox to keep all that info (passport & card numbers, phone #'s to card companies) safe and in the cloud. On a recent trip to Japan, my boyfriend kept our extra cash and passports in a security wallet that was tucked into his pants via the belt for his shorts.   Had you guys been there long? I'm interested to know if your routine started of more secure, but maybe had become lax due a feeling of being safe in the country. We got lax in Japan towards the end of our trip."
digitalnomad,3c06es,sobri909,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:50:36 2015 UTC,We've been here for about a week and we just came from 1 month in Japan then 2 weeks in Korea so our guard was down.  The wallet was stolen out of a zipped bag while we were walking so we might start to put safety pins or twist ties around the zippers.  It's always a balance of not taking forever to retrieve your money when you want to buy something small at a street vendor and being secure.
digitalnomad,3c06es,tunaflyby,2,Sat Jul 4 03:23:10 2015 UTC,"I've kept my wallet in my back pocket for the past 6 years of travel. Never had it stolen.   I think the biggest risk factor is looking like a tourist. If you look like a local, or at least like a long term expat, then you're much less a target. Look and act like you belong and the thieves will pass you by.   The easiest targets for thieves, I think, are the obvious tourists. The ones wearing daypacks, elephant print parachute pants, beer brand tshirts, cargo shorts and sensible sandals, reading a Lonely Planet, that sort of thing. It all screams ""I've got hundreds of dollars of cash in my wallet and I'm totally out of my element!"""
digitalnomad,3c06es,MsKim,3,Sat Jul 4 11:13:53 2015 UTC,Wow! I'm sorry to hear that.  I will be traveling to Asia in the coming weeks.  I just uploaded all my docs to Evernote so I can access it anywhere.   What do you have to do now that you lost your passport?

One 'delete' instruction sent from the wrong place and your mistake gets replicated across your devices.  I highly recommend using something like Arq (https://www.arqbackup.com/) and using your own encryption on S3.

Food is decent, but not a ton of variety. Internet access was good in both of the furnished apartments I stayed in. Easy to get a SIM and mobile data is good. The one downside I would say is that there just isn't much to see/do in terms of experiences so you might get bored after a while."

digitalnomad,3c0s28,Zachariah,3,Fri Jul 3 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have data for you.. I visited for two weeks last month to test out the environment.. thinking it colombia might be a home for a bit next year. I was more worried about safety, food, getting around, women & friends, speaking the language, etc...  I feel more comfortable with Asia, since I've spent more time there. It seems cheaper to be safe in Asia, and being more in the tech side of the world, better internet and less people eyeing your devices.   I loved Medellin, but I love a lot of places.. I still am thinking I might head down there for a few months.. but there's so many choices between now and then."
digitalnomad,3c0s28,Zachariah,2,Fri Jul 3 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I got so tired of the time difference I needed to make a change.  I'm going to give it a few months, then check out Ecuador and then Peru. Learning Spanish is on my ""bucket list"" so I figure I need to get the ball rolling."
digitalnomad,3c0s28,140414,2,Fri Jul 3 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"Ahh. Yeah.. The time zone benefits are a main reason I looked at S. America.   But, English is rough there. Most tourists in Colombia are Spanish speaking. And also the college-educated crowd rarely need english for international business. It's a whole different kind of vibe than Asia. If you're blond, you'll stand out and use that to your advantage (and disadvantage). I blend in too much for women to take notice of me, but also glide right past sketchy situations.   I get the impression that Peru and Ecuador are easier places to adjust as an english speaker.   I took spanish intensive classes while I was in medellin. I highly recommend it. Also the salsa classes. Life was great for those two weeks.. but I'm not sure what two months would feel like."

Internet was fine (5 up/3 down no problem). I agree about the food - cheap, but not a lot of variety (empanadas are fantastic, though).   If you don't speak Spanish, Colombia is tough -- particularly in Medellin, they haven't had enough of a tourist culture to drive learning second languages (English). It's a great way to improve your Spanish, though."

I actually just wrote a blog post about it recently: https://www.calazan.com/living-in-medellin-colombia/  Overall, I enjoyed my stay here.  But as others have said, there's not much to do or see in the city itself.  It's nice to take weekend trips to some nearby towns though.    For Internet, I was getting around 5Mbps down (don't remember upload speed but was much slower) at the apartment I stayed in.  I think I read somewhere that 10Mbps is about the fastest you can get."
digitalnomad,3c0s28,borrd,2,Sun Jul 5 11:26:07 2015 UTC,All I can say is that Medellin did not live up to my expectations and was boring and not very pretty. The internet was good enough everywhere I went and I did not feel unsafe but you need to be smart and watch your back.
digitalnomad,3c0s28,madbeetzyo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I've been living here in Medellin since March after living in Santiago for 9 months. Here we have 20Mbps internet (Claro) in our apartment. I pay 26.000 COP (10 USD) per month for 2.4 gigabytes of LTE data with Tigo. Our rent is 1.600.000 total for a 4-bedroom (unfurnished) place in Laureles, which is about 600 USD at the current exchange rate. The weather is amazing, the people are extremely nice, and there's great nightlife along the 70 in Laureles and around Parque Lleras in El Poblado. You can take day trips to nearby areas like Guatape (10 USD roundtrip on bus) and flights to most places in Colombia are relatively cheap. For example, I'm flying tomorrow for a 4 night stay on the island of San Andres in the Caribbean, and the total cost for my flight+lodging is 180 USD.  The city feels relatively safe, although I don't recommend walking around alone at night. You can drink on the streets in public here, and food is extremely cheap. Breakfast is about 6.000 COP (2.25 USD) for your traditional ""calentado"" breakfast of eggs, rice, beans, arepa, quesito, coffee and juice.  Overall, I love this city! It's super relaxed, full of greenery and has given our startup a really, really long runway."

digitalnomad,3c133q,_mindpalace_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:55:38 2015 UTC,Hmm could you outsource payments receivable to a reliable company or friend that you could pay? They don't need signing authority they just need to have the cheques sent to their address/a po box they can access and have them do your deposits for you.
digitalnomad,3c133q,_mindpalace_,2,Sat Jul 4 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is kind of the direction I was heading with the Traveling Mailbox service. They will do this for you. They mail to your bank's deposit by mail address (most banks offer this).  I just wish there was a better option for remote deposit digitally so the Traveling Mailbox service could scan my checks and I could submit them instantly electronically instead of waiting for them to mail the checks to my bank and then wait for bank to deposit.  I don't like involving friends / family in my business affairs and I don't want to change my address temporarily. I may just stick with the Traveling Mailbox service as I have to move again next year and I imagine it could be difficult / unprofessional for our clients to have to keep updating their mailing address. In the past, it has always caused problems, lost mail, etc."

Also, front end stuff changes more quickly, so I do think if you want to work remote focusing on javascript/jquery/angular/react.js would probably be a good move.

Not just from my personal experience, but from the experiences I heard from other .net developers at conferences and online.  There are occasionally .Net jobs out there that are fully remote, I keep on eye out as .Net jobs are usually more interesting than what I currently do, but they're relatively few and far between."
digitalnomad,3bxofy,Sinjhin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:23:50 2015 UTC,Bad news to hear. I believe .Net will make a comeback soon as Azure is great and the new Node server seem to be pretty impressive for the web world. As a System Analyst and more back-end coder I definitely like working in the full IDE of Visual Studio and the more mature language of C# rather than PHP.
digitalnomad,3bxofy,SearchingTheDark,2,Fri Jul 3 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"PHP is an extremely mature (almost painfully mature) language - one with a ton of problems though.   PHP, Python, and Ruby all have some great tooling around them courtesy of companies like JetBrains, though I'd agree that Visual Studio is the best IDE out there.  If you want something more corporate in flavor then Java is the obvious choice. Good tooling, strong support, plus you get the perks of picking up Scala/Clojure and being able to use a lot of the same tools.  .Net...Its problem isn't really one of a comeback, it's a question of attitude. .Net is still in regular use at a lot of large companies. There are twice as many jobs on Indeed asking for C# as for PHP or Ruby (though half as many as Java). There's a lot of work for C# - almost none of it remote. It will (IMHO) be another 5-10 years before your Microsoft Shops catch on to any remote trends, only after it has been thoroughly tested out by everyone else and only if they like the results of those tests.  That's the .Net community. It's not about Azure or Open Source or whatever else we want to believe it's about. Companies choose .Net because it has the security of the Microsoft name behind it; those companies usually aren't risk takers by nature. There are exceptions, always, but on the whole they're not going to grab on to new ideas."

digitalnomad,3bxofy,SearchingTheDark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:49:43 2015 UTC,"Hands down the easiest language/toolset to learn is Ruby on Rails - not because it's simpler, but because so much effort has been put into creating great tutorials/lesson plans/podcasts/interactive tools for new learners. There's a ton of great resources out there like Ruby Kohns, The Rails Way, rails tutorial.org, and depending on your city local meet ups like Emerald City that teach it.  All that being said. A junior is going to have easier time finding work doing Wordpress. There's a ton of work out there for Wordpress that while it SHOULD require skill, usually doesn't ask for (or pay for) it. It won't pay top dollar off the bat, but it will be much easier to find wordpress work as a junior contractor/freelancer than rails work."

digitalnomad,3bxofy,SearchingTheDark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:11:29 2015 UTC,"Haha, I share your pain there. I do Ruby on Rails and occasionally a little Meteor myself. It's definitely possible to break into Ruby on Rails as a contractor - you'll need a stronger portfolio than you would for Wordpress (and it's a bit more work to create each piece) but if you've got some decent ideas you can build out as you're learning you can make it work.  Just my personal method - but any time I'm learning a new language/framework I build a blog in it. Not that the world needs another way to blog, but it DOES touch on most of the major things you'll run into building most websites. So it's a good catch-all product for the skills involved."

digitalnomad,3bv7zh,alwaysonesmaller,3,Thu Jul 2 14:00:27 2015 UTC,That's why they were getting flooded with 20 page books or series. Two chapters per book ten book series is a lot more money then one novel.
digitalnomad,3bv7zh,sfall,2,Thu Jul 2 15:16:54 2015 UTC,So is that what the Kindle DN's posting big numbers were most likely involved in? They were posting big numbers like $5000-6000 per month.
digitalnomad,3bv7zh,DNthrowaway2,2,Thu Jul 2 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was a gold rush for a minute but it's all come crashing down. I'm wondering if there are any DNs out there relying on this income who now suddenly have a stick in their spokes and what they plan to do to pivot."
digitalnomad,3bv7zh,DNthrowaway2,2,Thu Jul 2 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"So that is why they were all saying ""I earn $3k-$6k per month, passively""? They weren't actually making money part with money for their book?"
digitalnomad,3bv7zh,DNthrowaway2,2,Thu Jul 2 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"It depends. You still get sales from your books if a particular reader isn't subscribed to Kindle Unlimited. But in my experience, my KU borrows were about 75% of my income from Amazon. Since the change, and basing it all off the $0.0058 per page number going around, I'm looking at about a 60% pay cut. Amazon could prop it up to $0.01 or more per page, but it's nowhere near the $1.35 figure per 10% read.  I'm sure there will be a way to game this new system to at least get near the old numbers. I don't think this change will reward quality; rather, it will reward quantity/page turns. People versed in marketing will figure out how to get readers to turn more pages and get that bigger pay out. But it's going to take months most likely and I feel for people who've been relying on this for their only income, especially those who are off DNing based on the old system."
digitalnomad,3bv7zh,HumanPiranha,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:04:31 2015 UTC,So basically you don't recommend Kindle fiction writing anymore? Did you write in the erotic fiction category too? :-D
digitalnomad,3bv7zh,HumanPiranha,3,Thu Jul 2 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe :P  I think you can still make money in that space but it's not the gold mine it once was. I'm still thinking it over and trying to figure out the sweet spot. Maybe novella page-turners? Cliffhanger chapters with gasp ads between chapters to eek out a few more page turns? I don't think 600 page sci-fi tomes are the answer as just because you've got quantity, that doesn't mean a reader is going to read it all. Ultimately, in the immediate future, I see this system rewarding authors who've already made it, have a fan base, and have a lot of pages to offer. Beyond that, it could very well be a negative for readers as writers figure out how to game the system again. Readers might find themselves flipping and flipping and not even know why. Marketers are a wily bunch.  Personally, I'm going to return my focus to development and marketing and maybe kick out a book every two weeks until the dust clears and we have a better idea of what's going on."
digitalnomad,3bv7zh,bidzini,4,Thu Jul 2 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"I've always focused solely on royalties instead of KUL just because I find it to be a more solid metric (as evident by changes to KUL) and didn't try to incorporate any gimmick 10% page incentives in my publishing. Having a lot of buys I would believe also positively correlated to higher KUL reads.  Judging off the example rate you have provided the changes will be a pretty significant cut in income for me but my approach won't change much at all apart from perhaps focusing more on optimizing Createspace side of things. Focusing simply on quality products, even though it is a decent pay cut for me I'm glad they've made the changes. The 10% payment scheme was ridiculous and was causing markets to be flooded with junk.   This will most likely favor the fiction genre over the long term as well but this is just even more incentive to hop over now if you weren't in there to begin with ;)  As a side note: This is why it's very important to diversify income streams as soon as you can!"

digitalnomad,3buag6,FriendlyWebGuy,4,Thu Jul 2 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"+1 for Lastpass, it's awesome, I use it too for all of the browsers and never have to remember any password."
digitalnomad,3buag6,leenomadic,3,Thu Jul 2 06:54:28 2015 UTC,"I use both (1Password for personal, LastPass for work, because that's what the company chose), and I far prefer 1Password.  Not sure why the company chose LastPass. Maybe it works better with group accounts or something."
digitalnomad,3buag6,sobri909,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to know how you think they compare, and why you prefer 1Password?  I'm mostly happy with LastPass but their UI is generally pretty bad. I've looked at 1Password before but the pricing is kinda steep."
digitalnomad,3buag6,FriendlyWebGuy,3,Thu Jul 2 09:59:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure how they compare on features. 1Password definitely already does everything I need. My dislike of LastPass was the unpolished UI. After using 1Password for years, then seeing LastPass for the first time, all I could think was ""yuck""."
digitalnomad,3buag6,sobri909,3,Thu Jul 2 10:38:29 2015 UTC,I prefer 1Password because the data isn't stored on any central servers like LastPass. You can sync it via dropbox if you really wanted (I use Bittorrent Sync with another PC I have) but you at least won't run the risk of this problem:  http://lifehacker.com/lastpass-hacked-time-to-change-your-master-password-1711463571
digitalnomad,3buag6,100acrewood,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:38:00 2015 UTC,I still prefer things that aren't online (just recently last pass had a minor security breach). I'm using KeePass and liking that. You can keep an encrypted key database on Dropbox or wherever and keep the private key and password to it on a safely stored USB drive.
digitalnomad,3buag6,radicality,6,Thu Jul 2 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"1Password for all passwords, and Evernote for all documents.   Every paper or digital receipt, booking, anything, everything, I file it in Evernote. Everything.  That makes them all available online and searchable from any of my devices, which is helpful in many ways. For the specific purpose of getting your family access to that stuff if you die, you could just give someone the password to your Evernote account.  For 1Password, I have it syncing to Dropbox. So if someone had my Dropbox password they could get my 1Password data. Though they'd also need the 1Password database's master password."
digitalnomad,3buag6,sobri909,3,Thu Jul 2 08:21:09 2015 UTC,"You should be using a tool like 1Password to generate unique passwords for each site anyway, so maybe take the master password for that and stick it in a safety deposit box or something like that? Just be sure to document the steps necessary to access it.  It's probably worth mentioning at this point that everyone should set up a will/living will/power of attorney, and probably to document your assets somewhere to make it easier for your family to figure things out in the event of an accident.  http://getyourshittogether.org has some checklists that may be useful."
digitalnomad,3buag6,n0damage,3,Thu Jul 2 07:45:54 2015 UTC,"Google has something called, I think, Google Inactivity Manager. It's in your account settings. It sends out an email to a chosen list of recipients if you don't login in three months. It also gives those people access to the Google services you specify.  I use a password manager (Lastpass) so giving them my master password in that email ensures they'll have access to everything. But giving them access to the email you use to sign up on websites means they can reset all passwords anyway.  Warning, though... Writing that email is fucking hard. :/"
digitalnomad,3buag6,Triseult,3,Thu Jul 2 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for GIM, I only know it now and it's great. Never planed for my death before but now it makes me think seriously about it, don't want to die or somehow lose memory with all of my money left in the bank, and without a message to my loved ones. I've written that email, yeah it was so hard to write it, took me 1 hour for a few sentences, feel like I will be killed tomorrow. However anything can happen so it's worth to get prepared, especially when we're not living with our family."
digitalnomad,3buag6,leenomadic,2,Thu Jul 2 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"I use 1password to keep a log of all my passwords.  You can give them the master password to access your logins, password, ID, and other informations."

digitalnomad,3buag6,babyboy808,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:02:14 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this not too long ago. I thought of something but haven't implemented it yet. My idea was to have a mail server setup somewhere. You have something watch incoming messages for a string in the subject. If the string matches then it would send messages to a pre-determined list of people who I know I could trust with instructions on things like how to connect to all of my accounts/servers, documentation on what exactly all of the servers do, locations of important files (tax records, family photos, passport, etc), and contact info for people who would need to be informed of my death (mainly coworkers or friends from disparate circles).. same thing for companies that have services that need to be cancelled (credit cards, subscriptions).  I'd also put a delay of like 3 days or so. Like first have it send an email to my address with a link to cancel the request if I am still alive.  I could just add the instructions for how to send the email to my will along with ""first level"" passwords like lastpass or the files on the servers which would need to be encrypted.  Even though the reason for doing it is a bit morbid, I think it sounds like a pretty fun project."
digitalnomad,3buag6,thelastknowngod,0,Fri Jul 3 06:01:47 2015 UTC,"First off, what you are describing is against the terms of use and probably illegal.  If you die, your assets need to go through the legal process to be transferred and may be subject to probate.  Your family can't just log in after you are dead, transfer the money out and close your account.  That would be considered fraud, particularly if you owe someone money.  You can do a power of attorney so your family could do it while you are on your death bed, but when you die it expires.  Banks handle this all the time - a copy of the death certificate and a court order and they transfer the accounts to a different person's name.  What you can do is set up your accounts as joint accounts and create a second login for a trusted family member.  The assets would become immediately available if you passed away.  I suppose you could randomize that password and then do what you are describing.  You also could document the location of your funds - the banks and account numbers and the process for dealing with a transfer due to death.  A clear cut will and up to date asset lists and your family might be able to skip probate and have everything wrapped up in a week."

digitalnomad,3bul7s,advecticity,7,Thu Jul 2 07:29:51 2015 UTC,"I'm eurasian and I've spent a lot of time traveling in Asia. As half-white, my experience won't be the same as someone who's 100% Asian, but still maybe it applies.   I've found in quite a few countries locals will talk to me in their language and expect me to answer in kind. When I don't, after an initial shock, they'll always go straight to treating me like a foreigner/tourist (in Thailand for example, how much a tuk-tuk driver charges me before they realise I'm not Thai is substantially less than after I speak English). In Japan and Korea a lot of the host families my partner and I stayed with (met through couchsurfing or wwoofing) were really intent on teaching me Japanese/Korean, dressing me up/playing with my hair, taking photos of me, cuddling me (hahaha) and basically treating me like family. But they didn't warm up in the same way to my boyfriend (super white tall dude). I don't know if this had more to do with my being a tiny lady or to do with being Asian.   I don't think there's any real clear cut advantages/disadvantages I can tell you about being a culturally white Asian in Asia... maybe in the super touristy countries, you can get local rates if you avoid speaking English in transactional situations? People aren't dumb though, they'll realise eventually. Just remember you're still a foreigner navigating a foreign culture. This isn't a bad thing.  Asians aren't super rare in European major cities (well not the ones I've been to). They are rare in rural areas in Europe. The worst I've copped in these cases is annoying curiosity (intense questioning of my ethnicity by strangers), I've rarely experienced racism. Your being culturally white will make it semi-easy to navigate things anyway.  This is long. I don't know if I understood your question or gave you a useful answer, haha."
digitalnomad,3bul7s,marymei,4,Thu Jul 2 08:39:02 2015 UTC,"I'm an Asian, have been cycling the routes between Asia countries continuously for years, and I have the same experience with local people like you said above. It's funny that when I stay in a foreign country, local people think I'm local and tend to initially speak their language to me, however when I'm in my own country, people think I'm from some other part of the globe and speak English to me lol  It's also an advantage that when I drive on a quiet road late at night, I still feel safe because I really look like a local, not a tourist. And when I buy something, they don't usually over charge me and try to be very friendly, hospitable to me. It's easy to get close to local people because they feel comfortable with a similar face and culture when I talk to them. The places I've stayed usually where local people don't always expect to see an Asian ex-pat, so when they see me and know where I'm from, it makes it a surprise for them and they often find me an interesting person and really appreciate what I do. I love that.  Plus, when I miss home, it won't take me too long and too much money to fly back home to visit my loved ones.  However, the most disadvantage thing for being an Asian (especially SE Asian) is the passport which gives me a lot of hassle with obtaining visas. The visa situation wastes me a lot of time and money to go to countries that don't have a visa exemption for me.  Anyways, I feel it's good for being an Asian digital nomad, I somehow feel myself unique in the community with mostly people from the west."

I usually drive home alone late at night (1-2AM), and I really look more like a local mafia than a tourist, skinny, long hair, tattooed, with an unusual laptop bag that would make people think that it has a gun or a knife or drugs inside lol there have been a lot of times I'm pulled over by the police for bag check at night. If I go into a club with my laptop bag, they always check it before letting me in, and they are surprised when it's only a Macbook inside :) Your appearance matters."

In Singapore which is very multicultural I felt that I blended in more or less completely and even got asked for directions a couple times by the locals.  However I would say that the majority in places like Thailand and Indonesia still recognized me as a foreigner. One thing that was kind of funny is that people seemed confused about the concept of an ""Asian American"" -- they seem to be unaware that millions of Asians live in the U.S. and other Western countries. ""You're American?...but your face looks Asian"" was a comment I got several times. I also got several people in Thailand insisting that ""you look Thai"", and I wondered if it had to do with the fact that Eurasian-looking Thai people often appear in ads and on TV.  I do think there was some advantage in terms of being able to blend in. Not completely, but I probably stood out less than a > 6 foot, blond haired blue eyed white person."
digitalnomad,3btbjy,sts816,5,Wed Jul 1 23:47:26 2015 UTC,"Dude, stick with it. $1000 is not a lot of money in todays world, especially on a monthly basis. So, it's achievable with a decent idea and some time investment. Affiliate sales are not the best options, since it's competitive and you're essentially selling someone elses products/services. I personally believe creating a good web app that charges a low monthly fee is the best option. Think $5-10/month. Or a fixed fee, like Fiverr.com  Maybe build an app where people buy/sell CAD designs or businesses can contract freelancers, or something similar. Use all your talents and focus on your passions...eventually it'll make money. And don't let yourself get burned out.  All of the successful sites out there took A LOT of time investment. You can do it too if you commit yourself. Create milestones, organize your timeline and stick to it. Make your business your second job."

I'm only a few weeks into putting my site together, so no revenue yet. I would like to see about the same return as you're looking for, $1,000 a month or so.   I'm also supplementing with freelance income, because I've found that you really need to have multiple sources of income to get by.   I'm leaving in 3.5 months for Central America and Mexico, so I do want to have as much in place by then as possible. This is my short(ish) trial run, I figure if I can make it for 2 months, it's worth packing all my stuff into a storage unit and living that way full time."
digitalnomad,3btbjy,IrishWilly,2,Thu Jul 2 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"Cool, maybe we'll both get answers. Maybe I ask how your freelancing is going? Like I mentioned before, this is an avenue I might explore in the future. One of the issues I run into is how exactly do I know when I'm ""good enough"" to freelance? When I think freelance, I think of a seasoned professional with possibly decades of experience under his/her belt. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to compete with other CAD freelancers anytime soon."
digitalnomad,3btbjy,tmarthal,4,Thu Jul 2 00:22:03 2015 UTC,"If you can do the work requested you are good enough, it is that simple. That is what matters to your clients despite if your own standards are higher."
digitalnomad,3btbjy,Nymphetamean,3,Thu Jul 2 01:00:02 2015 UTC,True. And I suppose I could be picky about the projects/clients I take on so I don't get too overwhelmed at first.

Basically, I have a few years of experience that I can't really use.  If you want to test the waters, you can find work on sites like Upwork or Fiverr, you won't get paid much, but it's a way to get a feel for the work and build your confidence. It also helps (at least in my field) to get some of that experience that everyone is looking for.   I agree with others, when you're getting paid, you're 'good enough' :)"
digitalnomad,3btbjy,kilroy123,3,Thu Jul 2 15:41:23 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people make that and more.

He told me, it took him about 2 years of making no money at all. He was younger and lived at home, but he grinded it out for two long years until he started to make money. At all! It has been about 4+ years and he is barely making a good living.   He had no idea what he was doing when he started. He told me, if I were to get started now, it would take me at least a year of full-time work, to start to make ok money.  He works around the clock, like 8-12 hours a day. He has to reinvest a lot of the money he makes. He gets away with paying no taxes, so that's the only reason he makes reasonable money."

I run a number of travel websites and a while ago I switched to running more Adsense because I found that a lot of people who were visiting my websites were information seekers, not buyers, so i made more money off CPC ads rather than CPL.  I have also recently noticed that new websites are taking much longer to gain traction - well longer than the glory days of easy SEO.  You can still make money off these types of websites, but the trick i found is you have to match your affiliate / adsense to that of the user's intent in order to get a decent CTR. Granted it's harder to rank these days for high traffic / high competitive keyword, but i know just before one of my sites got hit by one of the early Google Panda updates, i was making $80 a day from Adsense from just 1 page."

digitalnomad,3btbjy,ThriftyTricks,4,Sat Jul 4 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"Takes a long time, a Google algo update can (and will) destroy all your work, and you are better off developing a skill such as coding if you want to work remotely.  Look into affiliate marketing with paid traffic (see charlesngo.com) if you have at least $10,000 to test with and $10000 for living expenses. Otherwise freelancing is the way to go."

But to reiterate: it's definitely possible to travel and work without tech skills. My girlfriend is a copywriter and HR consultant. Several of my friends write travel guides and manage apparel companies and design marketing and conversion campaigns.   Good luck!"

Essentially, his tactic was to find a process that could be automated to save companies a few hours a month, and then sell a subscription to the product (NOTE: he had to sell companies on his product, as they didn't realize they wanted/needed it). He found a niche or two, and went with it."

digitalnomad,3bskep,IamVeryLost,3,Thu Jul 2 05:02:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second this. While it's true that most programming jobs can be done remotely, I think most companies would be reluctant to hire fresh CS grads for remote work. There's a certain degree of training necessary to get up to speed, and that knowledge/experience is transferred much more easily in person than it is online. But after a while, it is indeed quite easy to transition to remote work.  (There is sort of one exception to this, which is if you can demonstrate the ability to ship a real product to real users, then all bets are off, including whether you need a degree at all.)"
digitalnomad,3bskep,n0damage,2,Thu Jul 2 08:15:44 2015 UTC,"Start applying for jobs on sites like elance or upwork. You can start building up a profile with good feedback, depending on your  experience (I'm not sure what you want to work in, personally I'm web and mobile).   This will position you better for invitations to new jobs and comes in handy when you've got a limited time to work.  Despite what people say, there is more than enough work on these sites if you are good enough."
digitalnomad,3bskep,jimjimeth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:14:50 2015 UTC,"The first tier, of course, is to develop your core competency.  Don't assume that having a CS degree is an adequate preparation for dong meaningful client work.  Some of the worst developers we've ever hired had CS degrees.  Start consulting or interning for real clients as soon as you can, if you haven't already.  Next, you need to become proficient in customer development and the sales process.  This includes networking, how you tell your personal story, pitching, closing, and managing your customer relationships as you work.  Many technical people either lack proficiency in these areas, or have anxiety around them.  I've had amazing developers come up to me at events, and ask me if I could connect them with some work.  At the same time, I've seen B-players in terms of technical skills, do quite well for themselves as they developed their skills in the areas of networking, pitching, and closing.  If your are both technically strong and adept at these complimentary skills you will have no shortage of opportunities."

digitalnomad,3bt9yp,niceb0y,6,Wed Jul 1 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"Nope. Lots of hassle, plus how do you deal with returns, etc. With ebay and paypal's new (stupid) 180 day dispute policy (vs. the old 45 day policy) you could have a forced 'refund' 6 months down the line if the buyer says the item isn't as described (i.e. they broke it or got bored with it 6 months later)."
digitalnomad,3bt9yp,_mindpalace_,2,Wed Jul 1 23:37:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. Also worrying about inventory could be a nightmare if you're moving around a lot.  Drop shipping seems to be getting bigger in the digital nomad communities but that seems like mostly a pyramid scam.
digitalnomad,3bt9yp,CoffeeTheGreat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:28:15 2015 UTC,seems like mostly a pyramid scam.   I absolutely love it when someone with no knowledge of an issue throws shade on it.  Do you care to explain how it's like a pyramid scheme?
digitalnomad,3bt9yp,urbangentlman,3,Mon Jul 6 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, and you can totally disagree. I'm ok with that. Here's what I've seen:  There's nothing inherently wrong with drop shipping as a business. It makes good business sense to not have to carry any inventory and there's room to exploit a market inefficiency if perhaps the manufacturer of an item doesn't have marketing savvy or a good way to get in touch with its potential customers. Many really big businesses do it along with many one man shops. This is the part I get.  The part that I disagree with is that many people get into drop shipping because they went to a conference, watched a podcast, read a book or something else that more than likely cost a decent chunk of change and were sold on the lifestyle of the author. Who doesn't want to live in exotic locations and make passive income?  I would say the majority* of these people try out drop shipping with something like a selfie stick. They don't immediately find a niche that is profitable so they go back to the podcasts and perhaps get a membership this time around and maybe some one-on-one coaching. They may or may not find a niche but I'll say that in general the attrition rates are probably high.   There are a lot of people in the drop shipping game and some people have doing this for a long time and have automated everything. They find the products that are trending, set up a Shopify store, buy adwords, and everything else all without having to know anything about the items. The newbies are competing with these people for better or for worse.  The money isn't as easy as it was in the late aughts. Setting up a store is easier, but marketing and SEO aren't necessarily the cheapest things. It's hard to get to the top of Google and Amazon rankings which many programs aren't as forth coming about.  So this hypothetical person will wash out but they've spent money on the books, podcasts, etc. of the people that have become famous for drop shipping. It's in this way that the small number of people on the top make money from a lot of people on the bottom. They aren't making 6 figures a year by selling niche furniture, selfie sticks, or carnival prizes. They make that money by having people pay for the conferences, coaching, books, retreats, swag and whatever else.   wild speculation based off of a really small sample size"

digitalnomad,3bt9yp,urbangentlman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yep. And there are huge issues with drop shipping as well, having bought a few drop ship items (unbeknownst to me when I placed the order) and had to return them, get a refund, etc. It's too much of a hassle for me, so I can't see it being convenient for someone living a nomadic lifestyle."
digitalnomad,3bt9yp,_mindpalace_,3,Thu Jul 2 13:37:11 2015 UTC,"You're 15 years too late. The market is saturated.   Also, I imagine handling everything remotely would he very costly and difficult."

digitalnomad,3bt9yp,wax_addict,2,Fri Jul 3 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"Are you in Thailand? If so forget it. The defect system will fuck you over as international buyers complain about posting time etc..   There are some people doing extremely well selling crap like bags and all the usual market stuff but mainly it's because they started a few years ago and managed to build up a solid amount of sales per month before the ebay changes, so that now the defects are diluted by pure sales volume. Unless you're making more than 400 transactions or something every 3 months the period for defects is 12 months. To get to 400+ now you need to list A LOT, ideally get Top Seller status AND be able to compete on price, which is a nightmare because ppl are selling stuff for minimal profit as it is.  Basically the ship has sailed and running a business on Ebay in your home country is a nightmare today, let alone from Thailand where everyone whores out the local goods thinking they're gonna be rich but in the end they're just flooding the market and driving prices down. It was viable years ago but not today IMO."

First, it is a saturated market.  Especially in that realm unless you can find something that would differentiate you from the others  The second thing is that you need to get it up and running.  Have everything filled up and running smoothly.  A foreign country isn't the place to be finding suppliers,etc etc.  You may want to consider drop shipping or amazon FBA as opposed to eBay.  Cheers"

Usually Taghazout is full of surfers but the next few months will be really quiet as it is low season. Weather will be in the 30°s with sunshine all day. Living costs are really low and there is a great coworking space (Sun-Desk) which has decent internet and good accommodation.   Regarding nightlife, pubs and bars ... there is none. There is no alcohol in the village, though there is a blackmarket if you are really into it and you can get cheap kif/hashish if you want to support the local drug cartel. If you want to chill out you can drive to the cooler mountains or go to paradise valley, which is a peaceful place full of lakes in the jungle.  Let me know if you need more information.

You go to Russia sometimes you get the shitty 5000 note, other times you will get 50 100 notes. Same with the ATMs in Greece.  Business all over Europe look at you like you're a crazy person anytime you don't have exact change, so that isn't because it is Greece. I had no problem breaking 50's or 20's there."

digitalnomad,3bokdj,qt2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:58:32 2015 UTC,"Switching to the euro took over two years of implementation IIRC (updating banking systems, remaking the coin-operated machines, converting legal fines and fees, and simply manufacturing the cash). Cyprus also instituted ""temporary"" currency controls, and those took two years to revert. The gears of bureaucracy turn slowly. So even if there is a need for a functional international banking system to further tourism, it's not quickly accomplished. I expect the Greece economy to remain on a cash basis in the meantime. Probably mostly euro, but dollars and bitcoins might also find their way into the ecosystem."

I can confidently say that Sarajevo, out of every city I've been in the 20+ countries I've been to, is easily the safest city I've been to.   In terms of charm, no city can compare. Rich history, super cheap food and drinks. The thing is that I had poor internet in both the flats I stayed. Every cafe has wifi, which wasn't too bad.   There are a couple other things to consider. Sarajevo is in the Balkans. It is super difficult to get around in the Balkans. Forget trains and planes, you're going by bus. Bus to Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro. It's just cheaper and more practical since the train lines are shit and slow.   Sarajevo is a small city. I'd live there, but I felt stuck there since it was difficult to get anywhere else, especially if you actually hate traveling. If you're going to hunker down there for a while it'd be great. Majestic and the most charming city in Europe, more so than Lviv, which I mentioned earlier.   Plus, there are some amazing scenery in Bosnia. From Mostar to Kravica Waterfalls."

I don't think you can consider anywhere outside of EE, not Czech Republic, I am talking EE, like Ukraine.  Lviv, Sarajevo, Kiev, anywhere in Romania, are some we have mentioned.  Some other cities which you should consider are Skopje, Macedonia. It is a small, active, and cheap city which easily fits your budget.  Also Skoder, Albania was a very small, but beautiful city. Extremely active city with a pulse. Food is excellent and really cheap. I say Skoder over Tirana because I think Tirana is easily the ugliest city I've come across.   I like Russia as an option. Saint Petersburg is the perfect city for me. Always something to do. Plenty of ethnic food. You can go to a new opera house, art showing, museum, or cafe every day. Extremely well connected city via buses, tram, marshutka, and beautiful metro system. My German friend said it that the contentedness and efficiency topples Germany's.   It's location is perfect. You can get to Moscow, Belarus, Tallinn, Riga, and Helsinki easily via train or Lux Express bus.  With the ruble where it is now, it is hard to pass up. I went from living in a student dorm, sharing a room with a disgusting human to living right next to the most popular metro, best nightlife, best street in apartment with several large rooms including a fireplace and a sauna. Things are super cheap.  Did I mention it has the best nightlife in Europe?  I think another interesting option could be Vladivolstok, which is a city at the very opposite end of Russia. It's cheaper, but smaller. Gives you everything could need and in close proximity to other countries of interest like, Japan, China, and Korea."

Marin is probably one of the most expensive counties in America, Sonoma is every bit as bad as SF, and from Mendocino on north (basically once you get out of commute range) it's pretty cheap.  The largest urban area on the North Coast is Eureka/Arcata. It feels wrong calling that neck of the woods urban, but it's the biggest population center north of Santa Rosa. The smaller towns are nice and inexpensive, though a selected few are more tourist oriented.  If you feel like getting really rugged, there's a lot you can do with a van in California. Most cities don't give a shit about people living in vehicles, and the National Forests (of which there are many) basically allow indefinite camping. Mendocino is arguably one of the best for this.

If these people are not experiencing any trouble, someone who keeps a low profile has nothing to worry about.  Also, this really is a gray area and it's not quite clear what is legal and what isn't. Is any country going to arrest and deport the businessman who flies in for a day and checks a few emails and writes a presentation? Or the guy who conducts a Skype call for work while on vacation?

digitalnomad,3bmou2,SearchingTheDark,7,Tue Jun 30 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much impossible to acquire work permits in the vast majority of countries - DNs don't really have a work status that's recognized by law (though it's technically true that it is usually illegal).  Typically to get a work permit you need a company in the country you're visiting to sponsor you - or you need to set up a corporate entity for tax purposes in the ones that will let you. What we do is rarely if ever eligible for any legal work status.  So I guess just don't worry about it, I know I don't. If passport controls asks why you're visiting just say you're on holiday. Don't mention that you work online, and never say you're there for business (this can raise a slew of other questions)."

digitalnomad,3bmou2,SearchingTheDark,2,Tue Jun 30 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"I know Cambodia at least makes registering your business and getting a work permit pretty easy (well, as easy as Southeast Asia makes anything to do with paperwork). You're technically taxed as a local business then. I've been told Romania is another country where you can opt to set up a business and hire yourself pretty easily - though I can't vouch for that one personally and IANAL.  The big advantage of doing that in the countries that allow it is you're 100% legal with the work visa and all the perks that go with it - those perks vary from country to country, but usually include infinite no-questions-asked visa extensions without the looming threat of laws changing/getting enforced that were previously ignored.  But that's really more of an ""expat"" thing than a nomad thing usually. The time it takes to setup a business, much less reap the rewards, is significant in many cases. So it's a bit of a commitment for your average nomad."

If you are working for a Thai company, you will need a non-immigrant (type B) visa and then a work permit in order to work legally.  If you are a ‘digital nomad’ running your own business on the internet, the immigration office says you can do this on a tourist visa."

digitalnomad,3bmou2,AccidentallyDamocles,3,Wed Jul 1 04:11:19 2015 UTC,"I've been mostly in Mexico and Central America and they don't really care but yes technically without a work visa you aren't allowed to work while you are there, including remote work. There are large populations of people who just keep renewing tourist visas and pretty much never have any trouble with immigration but the risk is always there. I've had customs agents several times ask me what I do for work with the implication that I shouldn't really be on a tourist visa but I just say I have an online business and they tend to leave it at that. If you are found abusing your visa you can normally be fined, forced to leave and/or banned from re-entry. If you travel to different countries regularly instead of just renewing the same tourist visa over and over in the same country they are much less likely to say anything. If you find a specific country you really like that you want to use as more of a home base, look into what options there are for residencies. Some require a certain amount of money, some require sponsorship from a local company, others depend on your profession etc.  I believe most people here don't bother dealing with work permits and just risk it unless they want to settle down in a specific country."

Even if you are meeting a client, you should apply for a ""business visa"" instead. However, if you are working from home or co-working space, eventually meeting clients and networking, it's very unlikely that an immigration officer will approach you. There isn't such a thing as a crackdown on illegal foreign workers.   I don't think immigration law in many places have caught up with the fact that you can work remotely now.

Although I am sure others have different opinions.  I would agree with some of the other guys on here, freelancing is a good way to go. To be honest - and I may get shafted for suggesting this on here - getting a full time job back home to get some training in the field you want to do and THEN heading out to freelance seems to work out a lot better for some people. That way you can build up some experience, and also network and find some contacts in the industry so that when you dive into freelancing you have a better idea of how and where you get your income. Finding contracts and building up your portfolio online from the beginning is certainly possible, but it's not for the feint of heart."
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,9to5traveler,2,Tue Jun 30 19:49:55 2015 UTC,I second the full time job suggestion. Especially if you are thinking of programming. Working with a team of experienced mentors was life changing for me and it took me a full 2 years of full time work before I was at a point where I'd consider myself a mature developer.  With 2 years of solid work under your belt transitioning to remote or freelance should be fairly easy (It was for me).

How do you find companies whose attitude is ""You don't have the skills now but we'll get you there?"" I'd be open to settling down for a few years to build myself up, to be honest, but only for the right learning opportunity (...and/or to prevent myself from starving, of course)."
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,fr1endlyf1re,2,Wed Jul 1 05:22:42 2015 UTC,"Companies are not in the business of training or philanthropy, so I don't think you're going to find one focused on hiring inexperienced people. Usually there is also very little focus on mentoring, that happens naturally as you work on projects with more experienced co-workers. Which leaves you with 2 options.  The first is to get good enough at a specific in demand framework or language and have proof of this via Github or similar. This doesn't need to take very long. If you focus and spend 8 hours a day learning one specific thing you can get pretty good in a week or two. Companies will often hire very specialized people and then let them branch out from there to learn more. For my first job, I did something similar to this. I made myself one of the top experts on a particular open source CI server and they hired me to set that up for them even though I didn't have much real world experience elsewhere. I ended up evolving into a DevOps lead role there after a few months. Similarly you could just get a lot of different projects up on Github and hope that the company doesn't look to deep into any of them, but I don't recommend this route.  Your other option is to network like crazy and get in the door via a referral from someone already in the company. This is MUCH harder to do remotely and even if you're on a tech area it's tough to get contacts in the industry if you are starting from zero.  tldr; Specialize in a specific framework or tool that's in demand and use that to get your foot in the door."

Let me share my experience and see if you can draw some parallels with yours - and maybe it'll help get some ideas.  I dropped out of a Electrical Engineering/Programming hybrid type degree back in 2009 thinking that I didn't really need it and I was making some money on the side anyway, so why wouldn't I make more - and then well hello global recession - I had been making websites to some degree for about 10 years up until that point, so I did have some knowledge to leverage a job, I had a lot of interviews (via an employment agency) and I was in Birmingham, UK's disputed second city so there were a lot of businesses out there, this actually worked out quite well. I was inexperienced in actual industry positions, however because I could show people some degree of work and competency at these interviews it helped me find a junior position at a few places that I could choose from - keep in mind Github and other online portfolio websites were either non-exisitant or relatively useless - I don't see why this sort of thing wouldn't work for you, provided you could build up a portfolio of work on Github, or another online profile. In my case I ended up choosing none of these positions mainly because they didn't really fit with what I wanted to do, and I didn't give up uni to go somewhere i would be equally as bored.  In the end a friend of mine who had began a web development startup (and I had worked with before I went to uni) offered me a job, provided that I could become proficient in a new technology - hello Ruby on Rails - and he would consider me. I spent 6 months or so basically recreating everything I had ever done in Rails to try and gain some experience and eventually I convinced the guy that I was relatively competent - and I got a job and training. Sadly i'm not sure that'll work so well in your case unless you know someone. However, it does highlight the need to find peers in your field who can offer you these jobs ;)  After 2-ish years there I went freelance, travelled, got an agent, made more money, now i'm trying to setup my own startup to span Kenya/East Africa/The World. I guess i'm a little biased towards the 'get a job first' philosophy as that's the route I went.  p.s.

Then I found one that liked me and was happy to train me from scratch, hoping to ramp me up to full time.  Then skip ahead a bit and I got fired :\  Thing is... I'm not sure that simply repeating that is the smartest choice, you know? (Even though I know more than I did then) That's why I'm looking for alternatives."
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,sobri909,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:36:13 2015 UTC,Why is that not the smartest choice?  You were hired as an intern and turned it into a full time job and learned a lot along the way.  Why wouldnt you try to continue doing that when it seems like you would be starting from scratch with anything else?
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,DNthrowaway2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"That's a valid and important question to consider, even if it's a rhetorical one. There are three main reasons that I'm considering something else:   I'm a ""big picture"" oriented guy, meaning I like to see things from a high-level perspective and then work down to the details. It's frustrating to work on things without understanding how they contribute to a whole. I found it demotivating to finish work, hand it off, and then have it seemingly disappear into the ether. I need to see external results from my work to feel truly satisfied. (I realize alot of jobs are like this, but I don't like it) After months of training and mentorship, I still got fired. Maybe means I'm like a short guy trying to play in the NBA, you know? It could be other factors too, but I have to consider that I'm maybe just not good at it.   So those are my reasons for second-guessing whether I want to simply retrace my steps and do the same thing with a different organization. I want to see what other options I have before I just put my head down and grind forward, you know?"
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,sobri909,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:16:45 2015 UTC,It is tough to do marketing as a freelancer because there seems to be a race to the bottom with price. Hard to differentiate from Indians who work for a lot less.  I would suggest searching this sub for the posts about freelance writing. There is a guy from http://nextstopwhoknows.com who is looking for native english speaking writers.  My advice is to do freelance writing and learn to code which you mentioned you wanted to do. Coding is a more solid bankable skill i think.
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,DNthrowaway2,2,Tue Jun 30 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"I totally disagree.  I know plenty of folks who are making great money as marketing freelancers.  It all comes down to how well you can quantify and communicate your value, and how tenaciously you  pursue opportunities.  Of course, getting off of freelance sites like UpWork and having more direct control over the interaction with the client helps you to become de-commoditized."
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,sobri909,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:45:32 2015 UTC,"If you don't like to use mainstream freelance sites, how do you get work?

digitalnomad,3bm5xt,DNthrowaway2,2,Wed Jul 1 12:55:32 2015 UTC,"As an alternative to the mainstream freelance sites, the alternative is to develop your own sales process, including lead-generation, qualification, sales presentation, and closing.  It takes more effort, but you end up with much more altitude in the process, and better control over your positioning and value proposition.  If managed well, those aspects can be converted into better contractural terms."
digitalnomad,3bm5xt,sobri909,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was mainly referring to UpWork, Google Adwords, LinkedIn etc.  Private networking groups like the Dynamite Circle allow you to build relationships, become an expert by posting good content and then build a brand around your name.

Were I ever in this situation, I would quickly generate a bunch of high-quality leads, and start finding out how to get in touch with them.  LinkedIn could be a great channel for that.  I would also reach out through my network, and reactivate those contacts.  OP may not have time to do a lot of reputation-building, but they do have the ability to quickly work up a focused pitch for a particular market and go after that market."

digitalnomad,3bm5xt,fqn,2,Tue Jun 30 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"I learnt decades ago, back before the internet existed, so I have no idea how long it'd take now.

I guess if you were studying full time, and have a talent for it, maybe you could get bankable skills in a couple of months.  The next challenge would be convincing people to pay you, given that you'd have no experience. To get past that you'd need to build up an impressive portfolio."

Additionally, you will need to provide inital capital of 2500 euros or equivalent in tangible or intagible assets.

digitalnomad,3bjffn,Martenz05,2,Tue Jun 30 06:12:55 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, the tax authorities in Estonia do start looking into the €2500 initial capital and whether or not it has been actually provided once you start trying to pay out or reinvest dividends.

digitalnomad,3bk6f9,justkellerman,4,Mon Jun 29 21:58:41 2015 UTC,I think the assumption airlines make is that if you're purchasing one way flights you're almost certainly a business traveler and price doesn't matter. Thus that's how they price the flights.  You should look into an open-jaw itinerary. Go to flights.google.com and do the multi-city option. I just put in Houston to Valencia on 1/20 and returning from Amsterdam to Houston on 2/24 and it priced out to $1174. You would buy the intermediate flight from Valencia to Amsterdam separately in most cases. You should find reasonable results for whatever your home city is.
digitalnomad,3bk6f9,IndieRocketScience,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:28:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, not only was I able to get somewhere with that suggestion of flights.google.com, but I think I have the missing link here, at least for the multi-city destination pricing. There was one detail I hadn't realized I'd omitted:  When I first was trying multi-destination, I threw up a few different cities in europe (3-4, whatever filled out Travelocity's boxes) with no specific intention yet, just trying things out to see what order of magnitude costs by air might be. However, it kept saying it couldn't find any flights matching my destinations. I triple-checked the dates and cities/airports to make sure they where correct, but kept getting that result. I started deleting flights from the multi-flight itinerary until it was down to just us->valencia->amsterdam, and finally it was getting flights.  Whenever I added a flight, even the return trip home, after amsterdam, it would come up with no results. That was when I tried to compare to cheaptickets, which was doing the same thing. Since I was never able to get past destination #2, I never successfully saw an itinerary with a return trip (and didn't think to do open-jaw as you suggested--which probably would have worked even that night).   I was able to find US->Valencia->Amsterdam->US flights in google flights just now, and am now able to do it on Travelocity as well. Maybe some third-party service they both rely on was having issues?  As long as there is a flight to the US at the end, the itineraries seem to be non-insanely priced, so it looks like multi-city works fine after all. PDX->Valencia->Amsterdam->PDX is $1,734, while PDX->Valencia->Amsterdam would be $3,066. So now I have something I can work with. :) I like the open jaw idea, too, since that gives me some more flexibility to be spontaneous. Incidentally, flights.google.com seems much nicer to deal with for quickly trying different things than the traditional travel sites I've been using.  Thanks."
digitalnomad,3bk6f9,magictravelblog,2,Tue Jun 30 00:01:12 2015 UTC,"It seems like once you aren't making flight plans that involve 2-4 week vacations, it all breaks down   Pretty much. Airlines etc are heavily optimized for short vacations and short business trips because that is what most people are doing.   Why would a one way ticket cost twice as much as a round trip with a hotel for a week?    That is weird. I don't have a good explanation for that aside from suspicion that the prices for the various routes are likely determined by software and you are probably bumping into some poorly handled edge case. That can be a good thing if you are finding weird super low fares but that isn't the case here.   Why would a multi-destination flight going to Amsterdam afterword cost nearly $1,200 more when an individually booked flight is only $157.50?   Possibly just a tax on convenience. People like all inclusive type deals for vacations and not having to separately book a bunch of stuff so you tend to pay for having that handled for you.  You have a few options:  1) Book all your flights as part of one purchase. That allows you to fly into city A but out of city B. This is convenient but not particularly flexible.  2) Separately book a stack of one way tickets. This can be super flexible as you can pick up tickets as you go based on current prices and wherever catches your imagination. Short one way flights can be cheap but long one way flights tend to be very expensive so you can get nailed if get into a position of needing to buy a long one way flight because you have short flight hopped away and now need to get back.  3) Book a return flight to a single city and then just accept that you will need to return to that city prior to departure.  Option 3 is often the cheapest even though it can actually involve taking an additional flight to get back to your arrival/departure city. This is actually what we often do. We are Australian and typically book return tickets Australa <-> Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia's capital). We arrive in KL, travel on to wherever we want but then have to return to KL from wherever it is we went in order to fly back to Australia when we are next due to visit the family."

So instead of paying $1500 for a one-way flight Quebec >Zagreb, I paid $800... I'd definitely recommend this method!  It might be a bit more complicated, since you have to switch airlines/check-in again in another airport and you have to make sure you have enough time between your flights, but once you do it a few times, it becomes a lot easier!

If you'd care to provide some references as to why you believe OSX isn't generally considered the go-to OS for creative professionals, I'd love a counterpoint (because, you know, that's the entire goal of discussion). A quick google of ""why do so many creative professionals uses Macs"" will provide you with a quick summary of discussions regarding why I stated my view previously.  Subjectively, I personally feel like OSX has gotten a bit bloated these past few years, and Windows has certainly gotten better since Windows 8. Linux remains a useful OS if you have the technical skills to customize it (which some creative professionals won't be able to do, outside of developers and other tech-focused creative fields)."

A colleague / old friend was also in town until last week.  I have a girlfriend or two in almost every city, and tend to socialise with her and her friends.    Do you tend to hang out with other travelers, nomads and expats?   Locals only, except when my colleague and I are in the same city.  Never travellers, because there's way too much cringe. The beliefs a one year backpacker has about the world and the places they've been are fundamentally different to the views a long term expat will have.   Also never digital nomads, because I've never liked to socialise with people in the same industry as me (leave work at the office), and so far my experience has been with digital nomads who are in their first year or two of travel, and thus suffer from a similar communication problem to backpackers - we're simply on very different pages, and I'd rather not spend my social time thinking ""god, was I ever like this? please tell me I wasn't like this"".   The only place I'll socialise with expats is Tokyo. I've got a group of long term expat friends there who I'll meet for drinks every Wednesday and Friday.    Do you try to be a part of the community where you're living?   As much or as little as I would in the country I grew up in. I pay attention to politics, to celebrities, to trends and fashion. I smile politely to people in my regular hangouts, and make small talk with them if that takes their fancy.

So good that whenever I describe it the most common response is disbelief. I've been outright called a liar more than once. I couldn't ask for better, and it's already more than I deserve.    How difficult/easy is it to have relationships?   As easy as breathing."

Though I wouldn't say conceited is the right word. I'm not necessarily more proud of myself than anyone else might be of themselves. It's just that I tend to look down on other travellers of certain types. So I'd put it more as arrogant, patronising, or condescending.    I don't know, maybe it's the other way around, all those people you refuse to hang out with are the ones who didn't want to hang out with you.   Heh. Nah. The way I put it is the way it is. If I do hang out with travellers of certain types I find it very cringe. So it's me avoiding them, not the other way around.  My Tokyo expat friends are highly tolerable because they are mostly older long term expats who've spent many more years in Japan than I have. So in that group I'm the newbie. It's far more preferable to be the younger naive one than the older experienced one, having to listen to the youngster's wide eyed misconceptions."

I'm polycurious myself but currently in an LTR. I imagine ethical non monogamy is a great alternative for travelers who want to pursue committed relationship/s."
digitalnomad,3bittk,marymei,2,Tue Jun 30 07:50:25 2015 UTC,"Practicing ethical non monogamy?   Yep.  I'm 39, so have had many relationships over the years (including a few 3+ year relationships, which is often the skeptic's next question). So I'm very aware that monogamy doesn't work for me, and attempting it would be dishonest and unfair to my partner.  So for me the only viable option is non monogamy, whether I'm travelling or not. It's just particularly lucky that the travelling lifestyle fits so well with it.  I find it works even better with the travelling lifestyle, actually. A lot of the normal pressures of non monogamy don't exist in this lifestyle. Jealousy, for example, is practically non existent."
digitalnomad,3bittk,sobri909,2,Tue Jun 30 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome :) Ethical non monogamy is something I want to pursue. My partner and I are approaching it slowly at the moment, but it feels good. When we both become location independent, and if we ever spend time apart (seeming we've been together 5 yrs, and hopefully will remain together until we die, I imagine time apart will definitely happen) the non monogamist arrangement will work really well!

Because in my experience, 99% of girls will not be ok with this. My guess is that you are involved in the swinger community or some other kind of alternative dating community and hook up with people over the internet."
digitalnomad,3bittk,sinerider,4,Tue Jun 30 05:57:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not involved in any swinger communities or otherwise. My sex life is fairly vanilla, apart from being non monogamous. I date the same way as everyone else.    Because in my experience, 99% of girls will not be ok with this.   It's never been a problem. If anything it's actually much easier this way. Most girls I meet initially treat me as a casual interest, a play friend, because they know I'm only in town for a month or two. That makes the initial step much easier for them, because they don't feel any pressure to decide whether I'm serious relationship material. They like the look of me, want to spend time with me, but aren't looking at me as a potential husband or father of their children.   If it evolves from there into a stronger friendship and romantic connection, then that's a natural evolution. We are biologically designed to have it happen, so unless you're undesirable in some way, you'd have to put effort into stopping it happen.  I think that's the mistake most guys make. They try to formalise things, try to put things in boxes, give it names and labels, lay out boundaries and statuses and put it all out in the open. This kills the crab.  She is not your girlfriend, you are not her boyfriend. You are friends, who love spending time together, who had an awesome time last night, and can't wait to hang out again. Don't discuss the conditions of the relationship. Don't label it. Don't dissect it. If you cut it open or box it up it will die.   The women you're dating are grown ups (well, I fucking hope they are). They know how long you're going to be around. They've already asked when you're next coming back. They're smart enough to know that when you're not around you're almost certainly seeing other women. You don't need to spell it out for them. And if you do you'll make the unspoken spoken, and totally kill the mood.  Don't talk about other women. When you're with her, you're with her. Ignore your phone, ignore your past girlfriends, they don't have any place in your mind, and certainly not in your conversation. When you are with her, your time is hers and hers alone."

I think in your case, this can work well because if you move around frequently then casual relationships do not have time to develop to the stage where people can get hurt.

As long as everyone knows roughly when you're leaving and might come back, things tend to fall into place well enough.  One thing I'm careful of is not splashing around my relationships on social media. Never any photos of me with girlfriends on Facebook, for example. Each girl knows I'm not spending my time alone, but it's a whole other thing to have to see it every day on Facebook."

With the tea import business, the dynamic was, ""how do I do this in a way which doesn't take too much time/energy away from my main business"".

You're not too young at all.  In fact, you have some advantage as you likely have less financial obligations than older folks, which make it safer to take on such ventures.  You could land your first couple of freelance clients while you keep an existing job.

digitalnomad,3bgy07,thepredestrian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:24:24 2015 UTC,"1) I started my company in June of 2008, right into the housing market collapse.  First two years were very lean, having to learn how to generate business.  I did spend a lot of time in the EU, mostly Holland and Germany.  Berlin was a good place in terms of affordability, but I didn't spend much time there, as I'd fallen in love with Amsterdam, which was expensive, but awesome.  This actually provided some good motivation for me to do more sales and business development.  Towards the end of 2009, I picked up my first Fortune 500 client.  I remember arriving back in California, renting an E350 and driving around listening to Drake.  I took an extended trip through europe that summer, including Ireland, Swizerland, and lived in Dresden for a bit.  At the end of the year, I went to live in Argentina.  The combination of the Fortune 500 client, and the exchange rate gave me a taste of a new reality.  I was living in apartments and hotels that would have been cost-prohibitive in SF/Amsterdam/Switzerland.  Later that year, I went back to Dresden/Berlin, dated a mercurial German girl for a bit, then went to Prague for an impromptu weekend trip and met a Czech girl, who I'd date off-and-on for the next 2 years.  This meant a lot of time living in Prague, and having her come to Amsterdam.  I went to Chile for a while in the winter of 2011.  In 2012 and 2013, I continued to grow the software business, and traveled to work with clients including New Zealand and Nicaragua.  In September of 2012, I went to Japan and started drinking Matcha tea, which would eventually become my second business.  In August of 2013 I went to Brazil for the first time.  While there I did a photo shoot with a model friend who was starting her own online beauty supply shop.  Those photos got me noticed by a scount from Getty, who reached out to me about working for them.  I had a Brazilian girlfriend for a year, and lived in São Paulo until September of 2014.  I mad a lot of sacrifices for that relationship, and when I arrived back in the states, felt like it was time for some soul-searching.  I realized that for the last ~3 years, my income had been about the same, and I wanted to move that number.  At the beginning of 2015, I set a goal to double my income, which I did via machine-like work ethic, and investing in some excellent sales coaching.  By March, I had doubled monthly income from the previous year's average, and have maintained that new level ever since.  Since the start of the year, people had been approaching me about coaching and mentorship around digital nomad lifestyle, and performance hacking, so I started to develop that line-of-business as well.  2) 36  3) I've been an amateur photographer for about two decades.  I started doing portraiture in 2012 while traveling in Ethiopia.  In 2013 I did some fashion shoots while in Brazil and got contacted by a scout from Getty Images.    4) We develop, maintain, support and provide training for a variety of web applications.  Our first line of busines was creating Knowledge Management and collaboration tools for NGOs and governments.  Since then, we've expanded into healthcare applications, and analytics-driven marketing tools.  My advice for you is that besides growing your core competencies (e.g. coding, devops, etc.) invest in the complimentary skills of writing/communication, and sales/marketing, and client management.  I see a lot of technical folks earning below their abilities because of weakness in those areas.  Find some good mentors and coaches.  When you're able, invest heavily in coaching, training, and continued learning.  If you go the digital nomad route, remember that you are an entrepreneur first and a traveler second.  Your schedule, priorities, expenditures, etc should all reflect that.    Personal networking is huge, and you should be as active as possible in that regard.  It sometimes takes a while for the ""compound interest"" effect of networking to kick in, so start now, be as active as possible, and try to come from a place of helping the people you meet, not just promoting your own business(es).  Have fun, and ping me if there's anything I can do to help on your journey."
digitalnomad,3bgy07,proxwell,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"That's really cool.  One question regarding your point about investing myself in coaching and training. How would one go about doing it, practically? My understanding is that my aim is to make good connections with wiser people such that these people would willingly coach/ help me? Is that what you mean?"
digitalnomad,3bgy07,thepredestrian,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"Great question.  The way I approach coaching, training, and mentorship is to identify specific skills that I want to improve, and use that to guide my coaching/training investments.  Some examples of competencies you may want to develop are: sales, writing, time management, goal setting, discipline, marketing, bookkeeping, SEO, scaling your organization, contracts, managing your team, joint ventures, pitching, closing.  The key is to figure out which of those skills will help you grow the most at a given point in time.  Personally, I'm a big believer in developing Sales skills, as they produce revenue which is the lifeblood of your business, and can be used to fund the development of the other areas.    Especially early-on, it's important to get good ROI on every investment that you make in learning.  For this reason, it's beneficial to have a very clear idea of what you want to learn from each resource that you use.  Particularly with coaching, I like to have a very clear agreement about what the deliverables are and when we are done with each phase.  There are a lot of coaches who try to cover many areas, and put their clients on a perpetual plan (e.g. weekly/monthly meetings).  While that is probably good for their business, it may not be so good for yours.  While one can sometimes find a coach who can help with multiple areas, it's often beneficial to use a coach or mentor for just one area.  For example, my writing coach doesn't know much about Sales or joint ventures.  Finding and working with mentors is an art, with a fair amount of luck involved as well.  On the upside, lots of successful entrepreneurs like helping others and feel like they are paying the universe back for some of the people who have helped them.  One of the keys is to make it clear to them that you will make very efficient use of their time.  So, if you've made a good contact and you want to move the relationship towards mentorship, you could ask them to help with a task which is clear and well-defined, for example asking them to review a particular piece of writing, sales script, code, slide deck, etc.  Of you could ask something like, ""Would you be willing to occasionally review my slide decks and provide feedback"".  Asking for book recommendations is another way to start the process.  After you've read the book(s) they recommend you can meet for a meal and discuss it.  One important aspect to maintaining mentorship relationships is to take action on the things they recommend.  While you don't need to take all of their advice, asking for mentorship and then not taking action on the things they recommend is an easy way to lose them as a mentor.  I've been very fortunate to connect with some amazing mentors who have helped me grow my business significantly.    Inviting someone to a good meal is a nice way to open a mentoring relationship.  Chose a specific restaurant and ask them to join you for lunch.  This is how I started working with one of my sales mentors.  I invited him to one of the top sushi places in our city.  I spent about $150 on the lunch, but it was easily worth 10x that to me, both in the information I got in the meeting, and in the fact that it solidified the mentoring relationship.  You don't always have to spend a lot on the meals, but it's symbolic of you valuing their time, and showing some appreciation for them.  I'd recommend to start with books, and move up to courses, coaching, and mastermind groups as your revenue grows.  Meanwhile, always be on the lookout for potential Mentors and nurture those relationships very carefully."

It's possible to develop on Windows but you'll be constantly fighting with it to get basic stuff to work.  I actually need Windows for certain projects and I use it as my main OS, but I have Vagrant VM's set up with Ubuntu for any non windows specific projects. This is actually the ideal route to go in my opinion regardless of whether you use Windows or Mac as you are developing on the same OS that the application will be running on. Obviously if you know your server will be RedHat or CentOS or whatever then use Vagrant with that instead.  This also allows you to install only what is specifically needed for that App on your dev VM so you don't have lots of different packages installed and potential conflicts or version issues."

The ""it just works"" mantra is easy to go after as a cultish thing, but really, I'd bet dollars to donuts that if you compare a dev on Mac, a dev on Windows, and a dev on Linux — assuming identical skill levels and speed capabilities — the Mac dev will end up with a slight productivity advantage over time due to fewer issues keeping the dev environment intact.

I'm in my 3rd year (I travel in between times but spend the bulk of my year in CM) at a residence just south of the Chiang Mai Gate: I pay ~10,000 baht a month (can be as much as 10,400, depends on how much the electricity bill is, ie: how much I use my A/C) and I have a proper Western bathroom, microwave, big fridge, balcony with views, cable, room service, pool, gym, cafe in the building, along with a general store come bar area. There are 3 7-Elevens and a Tesco Lotus less than <500m away.  You can pay though as little as 4.5/5,000 baht a month as well in various parts, without necessarily all the extras.   The funny thing is: we're talking USD $150-$300 a month, which in reality is nothing compared to many places.  I like the area I live as it's quiet but I can still walk to the touristy parts like Thae Pae Gate, Loi Kroh, both the Walking Streets, Night Bazaar etc etc (and there's heaps of cheap food options in between) but likewise you might like somewhere around Nimman as well given it caters to CMU students so it's a younger crowd; I would add though that if you really want to explore CM Nimman isn't the best place but I get why people like it, putting aside there's an excellent Wine Bar opposite Maya that has the cheapest wine in CM :)"

digitalnomad,3bdte4,reddit-junkie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:21:11 2015 UTC,I didn't know about it / search for it until your post.
digitalnomad,3bdte4,itsbecca,2,Sun Jun 28 09:05:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bother with online stuff, their prices will always be inflated. Just walk around where you want to be and check in on places. Bring your phone and d/l an app to check so you can check wifi speed whenever you check out a place (ime - it will usually clock a bit lower on my phone, but it gives you an idea.) We're in a slower period for traveling right now, so you should be able to bring any price down 2-3k without too much trouble, unless it's a really big name, popular place. Also, watch out for utility costs. Electricity cost from the city is up to 4thb per unit (once you hit the highest tier of usage), but most places with give a bit of a surcharge on that. If you're doing a monthly stay at a hotel, as opposed to renting a condo, it will probably be much more than that, like 8-10thb per unit. If you're working from home and using your AC this adds up pretty fast. So get that settled before you pay anything, 10thb is too much imo. (For water you'll probably pay straight 200thb, so not a big deal for that.)  People like Nimman because there's a lot of young people and a lot of cafes, western restaurants, things like that. Just think of the young hip neighborhood in your city and it's basically exactly like that with maybe a few more street vendors and massage parlours. Yes it's nice, but it's also super busy (traffic ALL THE TIME), prices of EVERYTHING is more expensive and there's a ton of tourists. Personally I like living elsewhere and then just going up their occasionally for a nice meal or a movie. If we lived there there's no way we'd keep to our budget."
digitalnomad,3bdte4,payaway,2,Mon Jun 29 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"Personally I like NW of the moat. It's a good self contained area with an abunadance of room options, a good market, plenty of shops and cheap eats nearby but a Mexican or mojito is well earned after a walk to Nimman or The Pae Gate.  This map and guide gives a good overview of the different areas in CM: http://www.livingthai.org/where-to-live-in-chiang-mai-map-included.html. For a price list of a dozen or so apartments under 10k thb (mostly NW and Nimman) take a look at http://blog.chrisgrabinski.com/2015/04/26/monthly-apartment-rentals-in-chiang-mai/."

Wifi was solid, and the apartment t was right in the middle of everything.   I've seen Airbnb range from $275–700/month (which is high compared to what a lot of expats who search around for local housing pay). I was willing to pay extra for convenience, though.   Have a blast. I love that city."
digitalnomad,3bclle,ink_fish,11,Sat Jun 27 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"As a backend dev working remotely I make sure my Airbnb has wireless internet. That's all I have done. I only need 5 down/1 up/<100 ms at the least, which has been surpassed at all the places I've stayed. Outside of my Airbnb, I test out coffee shops and co-working spaces for wifi before I come back to do actual work later with the speedtest app.  Regarding computer getting stolen, all my data and config is in the cloud (Google Drive, iCloud Photos) and I have an ample emergency fund to replace it. Also, full disk encryption enabled. I use a 2012 MacBook Air which I could replace for $400 or so looking at eBay."
digitalnomad,3bclle,princehonest,2,Sat Jun 27 23:26:18 2015 UTC,I read in /r/cscareerquestions how difficult it is to get work as a back end dev while working remotely. Have you found this to be true?
digitalnomad,3bclle,NoSoul_NoProblem,4,Sun Jun 28 00:51:26 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not as hot as web development and mobile. However, there are definitely opportunities out there. I'm not sure you'll find one as an entry level developer, but with some experience you should be able to negotiate your way to remote work or find a position that would be remote from the beginning.  I did the latter when hunting for my second job out of school. I started by working remote a few days a week, a few weeks a month, and now I've been remote for three months and counting.  Granted, I still work US hours to collaborate with my team so I haven't ventured outside of Europe and the Americas, but there's still plenty to discover here."

digitalnomad,3bclle,princehonest,5,Sun Jun 28 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"For the workload, I make sure I build in a few days of ""settling in"" whenever I move. I also make sure to stay a minimum of two weeks in each place (4–6 is better). I also schedule for productivity so I'm able to get as much done as possible in very little time.  I also try to make sure everything works offline. (I set up a local dev server using Gulp/Grunt — you could use whatever you prefer.) Being able to work while offline has been great for my productivity. It's a little tricky not being able to pull up docs, but you could always store those offline if your wifi is really spotty.  I back up everything with Dropbox and check in all code to GitHub/Bitbucket every day. I spilled an entire coffee into my keyboard a couple years ago, and I was up and running again within four hours after buying a new laptop (using my ""goddammit fund"") and checking out the repo I needed.   Good luck!"
digitalnomad,3bclle,jlengstorf,3,Sun Jun 28 10:08:27 2015 UTC,"As far as connectivity goes, I've lived in 9 countries and 19 cities over the past year or so and have never been in a situation where I couldn't find solid reliable wifi access. But of course we're talking major cities and popular travel destinations that have infrastructure to support a modern lifestyle. Try living in a remote village up in the mountains somewhere and you might run into trouble.   Also I feel a lot depends on the type of work you do. My clients tend to hand off projects to me and expect them completed within a reasonable timeframe, but there are no emergency Skype calls or constant communication back and forth. The requirements for the project are clearly understood ahead of time. If you have a more hands on client or employer you might need to adjust your approach and perhaps book longer term stay in places that have really solid infrastructure ahead of time."
digitalnomad,3bclle,yuekit,2,Sun Jun 28 12:24:23 2015 UTC,"It's not a big deal when it comes to the move day. If I'm on a project, I'll just send an email to my client 1 week prior to the date of travelling to inform them that I will be off, then work more the day after or on the weekend. I work only a few hours a day so it's not too difficult to fill the gap.   The first thing I do when arriving a new country is to get some cash out of an ATM then buy a SIM card with a decent data package loaded right away at the airport. So if I happen to have no access to Wifi, I'll use 3G tethered from my phone temporally.  If my laptop gets stolen? Well, I'll buy a new one, use backup data from my external drive to restore everything which would take just a few hours, report to the police and claim some money from my insurance company as I have my laptop covered. About the data, I don't worry much because I have everything synced to a cloud service and a backup HD, and all code files are synced to a git server. What if they have my data? Do whatever they want, I have no sensitive data at all, it's all php files and photos of random beaches.  What you need are backup, backup, and backup... of everything."
digitalnomad,3bclle,leenomadic,2,Sun Jun 28 14:24:13 2015 UTC,"Try to minimize frictional time spent for changing locations.  This comes down to having an efficient process based on the things that matter to you.  Mine includes healthy living spaces free of chemical cleaners, figurig out where to get organic groceries, good restaurants, and where to go for gym, running, and martial arts.  Much of that can be offloaded to virtual assistants to keep me focused on my core work.  You should always have access to wifi.  If you don't, move.  If my computer gets stolen, I use a cloud-based backups, as well as time-machine backups to a HDD when I'm in my home country every 2-8weeks."

Honestly, my best luck in the states has always been going with extended stay hotels. They're not the nicest places you can go, but the rates are usually affordable on a monthly basis and what they lack in style they make up for in convenience.  Crossland Suites, Value Place, and Extended Stay America are three big national brands that can get you to just about any U.S. city.  Note: They're still not cheap - in most places you're looking at slightly over $1000/monthly, in some like around NYC you're looking at significantly more than that.   Unsolicited, but some of my favorite U.S. cities for hanging out if you have a car:    Salt Lake City, UT (Go in winter, avoid summer) Atlanta, GA (Go in spring/fall, avoid summer/winter) New Orleans, LA (It's not just cool during Mardi Gras) Silverton, Colorado (Go in Winter, try not to drive off the sheer cliffs) Asheville, NC  Portland, Maine (Fall, definitely go in fall)"

It's not travel costs that eat you alive. It's the day to day living. Have you considered going to Mexico? We're moving to Merida, Mexico for six months in 3 weeks. We found a furnished 3BR house in the city center fully furnished for around $250 a month. The internet is good down there, and you're in the right time zone if you need to talk to clients, etc. The Yucatan peninsula is very safe, and very cheap away from the coasts. For the $800-1,000 a month you'll spend on an extended stay hotel, you can have a very good lifestyle in the right places in Mexico.   I recommend Mexico because of the cost, safety, and very important- faster internet speed than most of latin america.   http://bit.ly/1R1Qnhc  That's a 1BR apt for around $83/mo. I mean, what are you going to find in the states to compare. Plus Merida has many of the modern conveniences you might be used to. There are 4 Walmarts in town, fast food joints like McDonalds, Wendy's and Popeyes, Home Depot, Sam's Club and Costco, etc. Many expats pay only $30-100 a month in electricity(depending on how much they use air conditioning). You can eat at a local place for lunch including a drink for $2.50-3. Decent speed internet runs you $30 a month.   Price a ticket to Cancun, from many areas in the country it can be VERY cheap. Our ticket was only $170 one way.  And Merida is only a short bus ride away.

You would be surprised how many places you can sit down and connect. Backpacking routes in Asia for example you will find a connection just about everywhere.  When this isn't an option i have usually been able to pick up a data SIM and hot spot my phone at a reasonable cost. I did this in Australia and it worked out well for me.

However, many cities will have much better coffee shops with equally good wifi, so poke around online (I Google ""best cafe to work from in ________."")  If you use Airbnb, you can filter for wifi. I contact hosts ahead of time and ask them to run a speed test on the wifi first, which has been great at A) ensuring I have fast wifi at home, and B) helping me avoid hosts who aren't willing to take a minute to help out a guest.   Good luck!"
digitalnomad,3bale2,NotLaFontaine,3,Sat Jun 27 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"If they're working from outside the country, I suppose it would depend on whether the country had laws forbidding local organizations employing/contracting foreign workers or businesses.  Which is difficult, given the nature of the internet. There are plenty of companies which have a web page which will accept your credit card in order to buy assorted data-related services, and there are no guarantees that they are necessarily based in your country. They might be a giant conglomerate on the other side of the world, or one person in a garage on the other side of your nearest national border.  How many non-Americans use Google business services, for example? Or AWS? Unless a country tries to block every single IP address associated with any foreign business, they're not going to have an easy time stopping locals hiring foreigners."

digitalnomad,3bale2,_mindpalace_,2,Sat Jun 27 11:01:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, I guess you're right. What constitutes ""work,"" though?  If I reply to an email from a client , even if the email is just five words, couldn't that be considered work?  Or if I look over a spreadsheet or have a 30 minute meeting via Skype?

digitalnomad,3bale2,guy_guyerson,3,Sat Jun 27 12:14:29 2015 UTC,"When it comes to people doing work for foreign companies, they actually are more likely to encourage it because you are bringing money into the country.   They still want you to have a work permit, to be paying local taxes, and to be operating under their employment laws."
digitalnomad,3bale2,sobri909,0,Sat Jun 27 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but ""work"" might be defined as ""being paid by a domestic employer while physically in that country""."
digitalnomad,3bale2,guy_guyerson,3,Sat Jun 27 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"It's usually not.   For example they want the law to cover the case of a foreign company setting up a regional base then sending staff there who don't pay local taxes.   If you're working in the country, regardless of whether the employer is based in that country or not, they want you on the books, they want you paying income tax and regulated under local employment law."
digitalnomad,3bale2,sobri909,0,Sat Jun 27 14:43:20 2015 UTC,I would think the regional base would make them a domestic employer.  How does this work with royalties and similar? If I'm in a foreign country and paid for book sales of a book that was written elsewhere would I be 'working' illegally?
digitalnomad,3bale2,guy_guyerson,2,Sat Jun 27 14:50:58 2015 UTC,"Possibly illegal, yes. Depending on how long you're living in the country each year (there's usually a threshold number of days at which you qualify as a tax resident) you'd be considered to be receiving income while living in the country and would need to pay tax on it, and need to have the appropriate visas / permits.   What kind of visa / permit you'd require in that situation to not be breaking the law, I don't know. Very much depends on the country and their specific rules.  But as a general rule of thumb, if you're receiving income while living in the country, you need the appropriate visas / permits. And if you're living there over the threshold number of days, you need to be paying tax."
digitalnomad,3bale2,sobri909,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"Are we distinguishing between ""living"" and ""visiting""? I was imagining a scenario where you're in the country for a week or month as an established revenue stream continues to generate income without your intervention."
digitalnomad,3bale2,_mindpalace_,2,Sat Jun 27 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"That'd very much depend on the country.   Different countries will define that one differently. Some are even so strict that even if you're only there a single day, if you do any work during that time you legally require a business visa and/or work permit.  Obviously most of this is irrelevant, unless you're staying there longer term and might be at risk of getting caught out. For most cases (eg staying a month or less) no one's ever going to notice or care.  But for example digital nomads working in Thailand on tourist visas / visa free are technically doing so illegally, even though they're not working for a Thai company.  Almost all of these laws predate the rise of remote workers, and are designed for different scenarios. Though if/when they do get reconsidered, most likely digital nomads will still need to apply for a different class of visa, and if staying over a certain duration be registered to pay income tax."

digitalnomad,3b92rp,Frater_Petrichor,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"Software as a service:       Software as a service (SaaS; pronounced /sæs/ or /sɑːs/ ) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.   It is sometimes referred to as ""on-demand software"".  SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office and messaging software, payroll processing software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software, gamification, virtualization,  accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), management information systems (MIS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), invoicing, human resource management (HRM), talent acquisition, content management (CM) and service desk management.  SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of all leading enterprise software companies. One of the biggest selling points for these companies is the potential to reduce IT support costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the SaaS provider.

digitalnomad,3b92rp,GringoDan,4,Sat Jun 27 02:01:34 2015 UTC,I've met some people that go to the Middle East to work for oil companies for 6 months and then get 6 months off. Then there's the dangerous work in Alaska based on time of year.  Anything else is just a matter or managing money and having some seasonal activity that pays well. I imagine something like Xmas or Tax time for businesses that make most of their money during these times would be able to achieve something like this.
digitalnomad,3b92rp,pjarosak,2,Sat Jun 27 03:44:10 2015 UTC,"In Australia, where tax time coincides roughly with winter, I met a lady once who spent her winters (~4-6 months of the year) in sunny Queensland being a tax accountant; and her summers running a lifestyle B&B in Tasmania."
digitalnomad,3b92rp,JacobAldridge,3,Sat Jun 27 10:23:57 2015 UTC,"Web/Software Development tends to be the most common on here. But traveling around, especially in Asia, can be much cheaper than living in the states obviously so a variety of remote jobs can support this depending on how frugal you want to live. I haven't personally done it so take my answer with a grain of salt, but many people have mentioned being able to live in SEA with an income of only $20k USD (traveling around). It's not uncommon for good developers to get $60/hr+, so if they worked full time for 4 months they would have about $40k to live off of.  However, I think this setup is difficult for the ""average"" developer. I think it would be hard to hold clients if you disappeared for 8 months every year. Most say that they tend to work 15-20 hours per week and just travel where there is internet. This way you keep your client(s) and you just take on as many jobs as hours&income/week you want."
digitalnomad,3b92rp,UbiquitousThoughts,0,Sat Jun 27 02:23:02 2015 UTC,That's incredible $60/hr I guess that's the route I'll take!
digitalnomad,3b92rp,Soulbow,9,Sat Jun 27 04:21:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know about other markets, but that sounds low. $60/hr is a freelance rate for a junior developer in Southern California, but keep in mind you'll have to pay your own taxes on that income if you aren't working for someone else.   Senior Developers with a few years of experience and good contacts can easily earn much more than $60/hr, or even more than $100/hr.   At the top end you could do consulting, here is an example of how lucrative that can be: http://www.kalzumeus.com/2015/05/01/talking-about-money/"

Personally I typically work 20-25 hours per week as a programmer but I do that more or less year round. My wife and I also have assorted side projects that we work on as we see fit. If any of those grew to be able to support us fully we could potentially take blocks of time off.   people who work consulting/IT gigs for 3-4 months a year and then travel for the rest   I am a little skeptical about this. To do that I suspect you would need to be someone extremely valuable. Partly because you would need to earn a fairly substantial amount of cash pretty quickly but mainly because you would need to be able to fill that work time window with paid work despite having just taken 8-9 months off while also telling people that you won't do work outside of that window.  You would need one or more incredibly understanding and patient clients/employers or to be someone so valuable that you have enormous negotiating power so you can tell people ""yes I would be happy to do that work for you but I am not doing any work for 3 more months so you will have to wait""."

Most travel blogs out there started with people from all different kinds of careers who dropped them and travelled on savings for months or years after.  But remember you can play with the other factors too, such as where you want to travel (Thailand only needs a few hundred a month to live) and eliminating more of your expenses where you currently live. e.g. I moved to a much cheaper flat shortly before moving out and that saved me a few hundred a month in the months leading up to travel, stopped eating out as frequently, etc."

digitalnomad,3b92rp,proxwell,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's certainly possible.  I've met several travelers who do a similar thing.  Also some non-IT folks.  I know a few guys who worked ~3mos on fishing boats in Alaska and went to live in Mexico for the rest of the year.  Also, a few oil rig guys who did something similar.  If you make pretty good money for your working months, and then go somewhere with low cost-of-living for the rest of the year, it's doable.  Not a lifestyle for me though..."
digitalnomad,3b92rp,joe_average1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:02:07 2015 UTC,"Have I heard of this, yes, but it is the exception not the rule. For the most part IT is ever changing and taking a 9 month break may be enough to make people question how stale your skillset has become. Unless you are an independent consultant you're going to have a hard time selling companies and recruiters on why you have all of these massive gaps in your resume.   The biggest downside to independent consulting is that it can be feast or famine and you generally have to do a certain amount of marketing in addition to working. That said, 3-5 engagements and you might be set for the year.  Here are some ways I have heard of it working:  1) IT Security Consulting  Writing and examining security policies: This work can largely be done remotely and I've heard of people charging more than 5k for reviewing security policies for smaller to medium sized businesses. Your skillset could be kept up to date by examining best practices and monitoring what policy failures have lead to breaches at other companies.  Penetration Testing: The tools are mostly free and there are tons of videos on how to use them. Invest in a conference or two per year and you can to a degree stay up to date. Everyone from small doctors offices to large companies need penetration testers. Of course most large companies have security people on staff, but that's not to say they don't/won't hire temporary consultants.  Form or Join a Red Team: I've never met anyone who has been on one but from what I understand, their engagements can last 3-6 months and pay very well.  2) Software Development  Freelance Consultant: Learn a language and get good at it, but keep in mind that some companies don't want a guy to come in for 3-4 months, they want an employee who will stay. Although pay can range from 30/hr-100/hr you need to have the skillset to demand that price tag and will generally need to produce from day 1. If you want to go this route it might be best to get good with something very niche.  Backfill contracts: It's not uncommon for recruiters to need someone to come in and finish the last 3 months of a 12 month contract. These are generally not remote, but may work for you. Form a good relationship with a recruiter and you should be able to land these.   Automated Testing: More and more products are now web-based and manual regression tests can be expensive and hard to scale.   *For anything software related you might need a way to show that you're keeping your skills sharp.  3) Project Turnaround  In this role your job would be to turnaround failing projects or convince whoever that the project should be killed. Not sure how you get into this, but imagine what a company would pay to get a project back on track that they have invested heavily in.  TL;DR - Look into IT Security Consulting, Software Development, Project Turnaround. Before you do this realize that you might have trouble finding jobs due to large resume gaps."

digitalnomad,3b7uvy,-updn-,2,Fri Jun 26 17:55:19 2015 UTC,Live USBs are generally good for trying out different versions of Linux before installing the one you want to use full time.  The other use is as a rescue USB. For instance you can use it to recover Windows passwords when the owner of a laptop accidentally locks themselves out or you can use it to scan for viruses without making the situation worse.  Something like this will create the drive: (http://linux.about.com/od/howtos/ss/How-To-Create-A-Persistent-Bootable-Xubuntu-Linux-USB-Drive.htm)  And then this to add the password resetting tools: (http://linux.about.com/od/howtos/fl/Reset-Your-Windows-Password-Using-Linux.htm)  and this one for adding antivirus protection that can scan linux and windows drives (http://linux.about.com/od/howtos/fl/Why-And-How-To-Use-The-Free-ClamAV-Linux-Antivirus-Software-Package.htm).  I carry a usb drive with these tools and many others because you never know when a friend is going to ask for help
digitalnomad,3b7uvy,everydaylinuxuser,2,Fri Jun 26 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"Sort of. I have a laptop, but treat it as a cheap commodity   my main device is 8"" tablet with keyboard. It is also a phone. No problem except heavy development. I have cheap laptop with second ssd in removable cd bay. I can just leave laptop behind and take ssd (most important and expensive part) with me.  I have full copy of my linux install on bootable USB stick.  If my laptop gets stolen the damage is perhaps $300. I can buy new one and boot up in ten minutes."
digitalnomad,3b7uvy,qt2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"Cool idea, but why?  I imagine you'd have trouble finding publicly available PCs to run it on. Much easier to just travel with a laptop."
digitalnomad,3b7uvy,sobri909,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:12:08 2015 UTC,"The why would be so I don't have to travel with my laptop and risk losing it. I'm not sure about the proliferation of cybercafe's in various areas around the world. I imagine some places have more than others. Also in the US most libraries have public use computers, or if you're at a friend or acquaintances home.  Carrying around a laptop can be a hindrance, also if its stolen it is a pain to get your workflow back up and running. With live USB's you could keep several clones (encrypted) with you at all times.  Not saying its a perfect solution for everyone, just wondering if anyone out there has used it successfully for their situation."
digitalnomad,3b7uvy,sobri909,2,Fri Jun 26 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"Internet cafes and libraries aren't going to be happy with you rebooting their computers into some mysterious new setup. If you're seen doing it you'll likely get kicked out. I don't see it being plausible.   Travel insurance will cover any loss of your laptop. Cloud and local backups will protect you from data loss. Just don't bring a ridiculously large laptop. Something 13"" or smaller is fine.  Depending on where you're travelling, theft is not a big worry. I've been on the road for many years and never had anything stolen, even from shared dorm rooms in hostels, back when I still stayed in those places.   As to your question, I'm not aware of anyone who's been actively doing it. This is the first I've heard of the idea (as a tool for digital nomads)."

I did start traveling without a laptop - and carrying a live USB with xubuntu, but gave in trying to find places to work and bought a small and inexpensive c720, which is super capable with a linux distro installed."

For me the sweet spot has been between $75-100/hour, though I'm looking to up that again before I bring in new clients. When you get to that point (achievable for most skilled freelance positions from programming to writing) you can easily keep it to part time and live very comfortably."

I started off on Elance, though these days I get most of my business through word of mouth and referrals.   Completely by accident I've established a reputation and portfolio in a relatively technically complicated but popular niche. So I end up getting approached a lot to build systems that are similar to ones I've done before for other clients, which means I can propose solutions that a) I know I can build in a week or two by dint of doing them a half-dozen times before in different forms, and b) I can charge respectable amounts of money.   It's a pretty good system which I wish I was anywhere near smart enough to have aimed for on purpose. Actually I just kinda stumbled into it.

My career track: majored in marketing & international business, went into advertising for a few years after college, quit to work on the first Obama campaign (was assigned to the social media dept because of my skill set), started freelancing with my boss from the campaign in 2009. Since then it's just word of mouth, really. You'd be surprised how many people need social media help with their businesses. I'm turning down work pretty regularly.  Average work day: schedule Facebook/Pinterest/Twitter posts, write a blog post or participate in a Twitter chat, go to lunch & have some fun in the afternoon, come back and respond to emails and post on Instagram and then it's time for evening fun.

And if you don't know you're making 20k less than the other guy who is doing the same exact job... well, that's just how it is.

Basically I make enough to live in 5 star hotels, and have $1000 nights out whenever it takes my fancy.   There's nothing about being a digital nomad that should mean earning less.

After reading some of the answers here, I'm not the only one with that kind of a rate (and it looks like there are some people with higher rates). That $100 becomes around $200K yearly.  Anyways, I'm currently salaried but work fully remotely and move about 4-5 times this year alone (I hopped around on AirBnBs for a while). I make $125K/year at a small startup as a Lead/Senior developer.   Sometimes, I look back and think about getting another $100/hr contract and just work half a year but then no one tells you about the pesky need to save up for vacation days and pay for benefits."
digitalnomad,3b3zim,reddit-junkie,7,Fri Jun 26 13:54:38 2015 UTC,Why don't you ask what we actually spend in US Dollars?
digitalnomad,3b3zim,ruspow,4,Fri Jun 26 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent point. What you spend matters, how much you make beyond your spending is just bonus for later in life :)   (For the record my partner & I spend about $50,000-$60,000/year for two people, including health insurance, travel, birthday presents, food, accommodation and everything else two people need to live. We're in our 7th year of nomading, so I'm pretty confident with that number, though it is inching up as we like nicer & nicer apartments in our 30s.)"

digitalnomad,3b3zim,reddit-junkie,2,Fri Jun 26 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with /u/dymockpoet, this is not a very good question. Being a digital nomad essentially just means working remotely, you can do anything from unskilled labor to freelance in dozens of fields to very skilled work. So what someone makes in one of those jobs has nothing to do with what someone else could ""expect"" to make unless they also have similar qualifications and experience.  Regardless, I'll add a couple datapoints to the ""unskilled"" column, because that probably has fairly wide interest.   For micro-task based work such as UHRS and mturk I've made $15-30 dollars a day @ $5-7.50 an hour. This work is easy, but it's repetitive and weighs on you, because unlike many other conventional repetitive jobs it takes too much attention to be able to listen to music/audiobooks/podcasts/movies while doing it. YMMV, but I would highly recommend you never plan to rely on this type of work for more than a month or two, use it to bridge the gap or make enough to live while working on securing other income. For Search Engine Evaluation work such as Appen, Lionbridge, Leapforce I have made $13-15 an hour, 15-25 hours a week. These positions seem to have long waiting lists (you may not be contacted for several months after applying), are fairly difficult to test into (unpaid training) and are temporary contract positions (meaning you may lose your job when a contract ends, even if you had good performance.) I would recommend not hinging your travel on keeping this job for more than 4-6 months, though it all depends on the company you're working for"

digitalnomad,3b3zim,SearchingTheDark,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"Cool cool.   So to also address your edits. The above money was enough to live comfortably and still save every month (Both for future expenditures and general emergency savings, more to the latter then when I was living in the states and had higher expenses tbh). Although, do note that this also includes my partners income of 400-500 a month.  When we were making the lower end of the spectrum we were somewhat restricted to fairly cheap countries to maintain a ""western"" comfortable standard of living. However, we still circumnavigated this to an extent by spending several months somewhere less expensive, then used that savings to make up our income gap when living somewhere more expensive.   Now we're at a level where we can live modestly in an expensive city, or be a bit more frugal in our choices (cheaper cities, traveling at off season, staying in a place for longer etc.) and allow ourselves more expenses for attractions or activities at our current location.  We have savings as a safety net as well, but it's for emergencies only and we have not used it up to this point."
digitalnomad,3b3zim,ruspow,-5,Thu Jun 25 23:38:03 2015 UTC,Not a good question. The term 'digital nomad' is too broad and encompasses everyone from SaaS founders to eLance copywriters. There is no meaningful average. Be more specific.
digitalnomad,3b3zim,ruspow,8,Fri Jun 26 01:18:55 2015 UTC,"The fact that nobody ever answers this question with ""I do this and I make this much and my buddy who does this makes this much ...makes me question the utility of adopting the lifestyle.  I don't want to just make more than I spend or just get by, I want to prosper and I imagine the OP wants to know what they have to do in order to prosper."

I no longer do the travelling around part of the DN lifestyle, but I still contract for companies all over the world (though mostly in the US), and I get the impression that it might affect those arrangements. I can't tell though if it's going to be good or bad for business (I mean, overall it'll be bad, but certain pockets of the population may stand to benefit - if it makes hiring or paying across country borders harder than it may reduce the competition for US based contracts for example. I know this protectionism is bad overall, but small segments of the population do benefit) because of the secrecy."
digitalnomad,3b2c5f,emanresu_sdrawkcab,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it (probably) mess with payments and stuff across country borders?   I don't see this happening. I think the primary purpose is to give global companies a better edge. So in some ways (at least for me), that means payments will be easier if I work for a large company and want to travel to one of these trade partner companies.   The key seems to be in the good graces of a large company and they will throw their weight behind you. The deal allows these companies to take the government to court, so if that government tries to mess with you, then you can have the company lawyers tie them up in court while you go about your business.   overall it'll be bad, but certain pockets of the population may stand to benefit   Right, thats how I see it. It'll hurt local businesses, but greatly help large global businesses. I think the writing is on the wall that we should be associating with the larger companies if we can. I think I'm lucky in this regard, though they might want to pay me what a foreigner is asking. So if anything we should be expecting to take a cut in pay ourselves.  OTOH, I don't think many of the countries have a large IT base. I don't think india and China are in this, which is what a lot of people are probably competing against right now.   paying across country borders harder than it may reduce the competition for US based contracts for example   I predict what this will mean is that when we ask for ""the going rate"", that rate will drop. The pool of workers just got larger. We're now competing against IT workers in these other countries (I work in IT). Again though, since India and China aren't it it, I don't think it will be that much of a disaster. I mean how big is the IT pool in Chile or Vietnam? Maybe I'm wrong, but in my field, I compete mostly against Indians it seems and they're not part of the deal yet."
digitalnomad,3b2c5f,aletoledo,3,Thu Jun 25 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"Off-topic, but I've found that when I'm competing against the going rate for people in India and whatnot, that I'm probably going for the wrong job. I want to be the super-high-quality coder, not the cheap-but-good-enough coder. For me to find myself in price competition with most of these others would be like Ferrari finding itself in price competition with Kia - in that case (unless either of those companies changes drastically) it would obviously be a failure of identifying and pursuing the correct market segment."
digitalnomad,3b2c5f,emanresu_sdrawkcab,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"Great point and I totally agree. However I get the uneasy feeling that they no longer care about quality. Did you hear about the IT group at Disney that had to train their replacements from india?  Quite frankly i don't see what I do as brain surgery. I think the only thing that keeps me relevant is that i have 15 years experience. If it wasn't for that, i think I could easily be replaced."
digitalnomad,3b2c5f,aletoledo,5,Thu Jun 25 17:29:49 2015 UTC,Quite frankly i don't see what I do as brain surgery.   That's your mistake. Its difficult to undervalue 15 years of experience and all the specialized knowledge you have accumulated as hard as you just did.
digitalnomad,3b2c5f,seekoon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the size of companies that care about quality has shifted. When I was in undergrad it seemed like a small company was the one that would have chunks of awful code written by the owner's nephew or something, while the big companies were the ones with dedicated QA people and automated testing and stuff. Now it seems like the smaller startups are the ones who experiment with all these testing suites and tools and methods to try to increase code quality, while the bigger companies are the ones where code is starting to be seen as a fungible commodity rather than the work of a craftsman."
digitalnomad,3b2c5f,emanresu_sdrawkcab,2,Thu Jun 25 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"That's how I'm seeing as well. These global companies are doing off-shore 2.0 now it seems. I think there is a similar deal to the TPP going on across the atlantic as well. I would say easily half of Apple's IT are Indian nationals and what they tell me is that the coding is done a lot from China.  If anyone needs us, I think it will be the small companies, but without being there onsite and local, I don't know how to sell myself to them. One thing I'm kinda hoping for is small companies poping up more in these other countries. If that happened, that would be cool."
digitalnomad,3b2c5f,aletoledo,2,Thu Jun 25 17:43:06 2015 UTC,A few of the smaller ones I've worked for have been fully remote from their founding. And it makes sense. Why invest the capital in an office along with all of the crap that implies when you can just ship a laptop to a new employee and pay for the slightly more expensive tier of hangouts (or whatever remote software they use) instead?

The pool of workers just got larger. We're now competing against IT workers in these other countries (I work in IT).    Pretty sure we are already competing against those people. IT is one of the areas that has the fewest existing barriers since it takes place online and is less regulated. I think the biggest impact of a treaty like this will be on real-world industries like agriculture and manufacturing. For instance, the U.S. is trying to convince Asian countries like Japan to remove tariffs and protections for their rice industry. Tech workers like us have already for the most part experienced (and in some cases reaped advantages off of) the full effect of globalization."

I suppose the most asked question will be internet availability and speed. Just done a test on my broadband;  Download: 3.11 Mbps Upload:     0.42 Mbps  I pay 27 Lari per month which includes the landline bill, approximately 12.00 USD p/m. It is I believe the slower package, and will be a shock to most people but it is stable and acceptable with 100% uptime over the last 3 months.  The cost of living is extremely low, I own my apartment so I have no rent however my bills are as follows;  Electric: 15 - 20 Lari Gas: 5 Lari Water: 10 Lari Monitored Security System: 70 Lari (all per month)  Medical insurance is quick and easy to get, premium package 420 Lari per year.  The electric is now better, is more stable and the power cuts that Georgia was famous for are a thing of the past.  Note: I only get water 2 times a day, i however have a 1 ton water tank so its not a problem.  Mobile phone services are extremely good but will be poor outside cities.    As an expat you can open a bank account with no problems at all, online banking is available. Pay Pal is available, however iTunes is not available.  The Police are great, it is safe, a large amount of people speak English and Government Departments are easy and helpful to deal with.  Transport can be a problem, the standard of driving here can be.......arse clenching at times!

Takes about 7/8 hours for the 500 KM and i usually paid about 100 USD.  Hope that helps!"

Azerbaijani Russian has a lot of Azeri mixed in with it so you may struggle slightly with some words. Georgia is a bit different, I have found starting a conversation in English is better then moving to Russian if necessary works best.

Advice: Make a good profile, get some HQ portfolio pieces together, then scour the listings (daily, check new listings that have just gone up) looking for the 1 client out of the 100 others on there that actually values quality over quantity.   I was winning 2-3 out of every 10 jobs I applied for, and I was focused on recurring weekly work that varied anywhere between $20-75 an hour.

digitalnomad,3avlxv,jlengstorf,9,Wed Jun 24 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"If you really learn HTML and CSS, you'll have job prospects. They're ""easy"" languages, so they get glossed over by many devs, but there's a chronic shortage of real front-end devs in the market. Most ""front-end devs"" are just people who've learned a few hot JS frameworks; that's not actually front-end, though.   Getting the nuance of HTML/CSS takes time and a good eye (experience). Learn vanilla JS, too, because knowing that means you already know most of how each flashy new JS framework functions before you start.   With vanilla JS, you're also semi-functional in Node.js by default.   So I'd say HTML/CSS to start — those alone can land you a job.   Then JS. Solid JS skills make you a full-stack developer.   PHP is useful, but you can do everything PHP does with JS now. So learn it, but not first. Check job trends for PHP vs Node/JS for a strong argument as to why.   Databases are worth learning as well, but start on the front end. Back-end devs are many, and the skill level is generally higher (take that with a HUGE grain of salt, because there are a lot of low-quality devs of all shapes and sizes and flavors out there).  Good luck!"

When I look at Elance and related freelance sites, most of the employers are wanting a lot more than HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge...unless it's a $10 gig.   I'm trying to figure out how to translate what I've learned in beginner HTML/CSS/JavaScript books into ways of expanding my minimal knowledge while earning an income, but, again, most require a lot more than minimal knowledge.   What I'm trying to say is it seems like you have to invest a lot of time in a lot of different skills (other than HTML/CSS/JavaScript) before you're hirable for even freelance gigs. Or am I wrong?"
digitalnomad,3avlxv,talkb1nary,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"In my own experience you have no chance of getting any job with a few years of HTML/CSS and a bit of JS, even if it is just Frontend. If you go frontend you need to have not only a experience but professional experience, plus basic knowledge of the backend stuff, plus knowledge of a few trendy JS frameworks (just to show that you are actually involved in this), then also add some marketing, design and UX skills and you might get a job.

Anyway, on average a webdev that just finished his apprenticeship would earn about 3500-6000 depending on where in Switzerland you are, about 5000 seems average for Bern the captial. This is without taxes btw. But also this is for directly after the apprenticeship, so it will still increase, maybe even double over the years.  Not sure about the jobs, we have a nice but classic economy. If you are into Typo3 and PHP, C#, Swift there are good changes you score a job, if you are after something more modern or exocotic it might gets hard, except you are really good and can proof this by a portfolio, then your doors are open."

I just try to convey that I'm ambitious and will put in any amount of work that it takes to learn what they need me to know. Be confident that you can learn anything.  A lot of employers aren't looking for the best programmer in the world. They are looking for someone they can communicate with, that will put in the effort and time required to get the job done. Sometimes enthusiasm > experience. Good scores on the elance/odesk tests help as well.  Again, maybe I got lucky and after these jobs I'll be fucked. Who knows, I just started this.

Working with Wordpress is really just editing the theme's HTML/CSS/PHP/JS files, it's pretty basic as long you know those languages. If you know how to program, you can do the work.   It's easiest to learn when someone actually gives you a job. If you got a wordpress job and someone said ""change x on this site""(which is what it generally is because there's usually a starting theme), I'm sure you could figure it out. It's just a bunch of googling until you start remembering everything.   Keep working on your own test sites, and applying to jobs. Eventually someone will hire you, even if it's for not that much money. That's how you learn and get good reviews on freelance sites. It's really not too far out of reach.

I spent a very long time making a lot of money (over six figures USD) doing nothing but highly customized WordPress themes. The work was 90%+ HTML/CSS with light JS (mostly changing container classes to trigger CSS states) with the rest being the PHP to insert WP template tags. (You can hire this out very easily; I did that for the last few years even though I know how to do it myself.)  Don't fall into the trap of believing that there's a magical quantity of knowledge required to get freelance work. There's not. It just requires knowing a little bit more than a client and having the confidence to sell that.   You'll pick up skills with experience. I recommend picking up as many as you can over time, because it keeps the job exciting. But no matter what you work on, HTML/CSS will come up. And JS will be close behind.   Good luck!"

Being able to create usable, semantic, modular markup and style sheets is unbelievably necessary and rare. IBM just hired a friend of mine to try and rescue their bloated, disjointed front-end.

LAMP, however, has kind of peaked, and the amount of cheap developers is plentiful while the amount of jobs is slowly decreasing in favor of better (or seemingly better) solutions.

Learn Python or Ruby, outside of a web framework entirely, and get your basics down. Learn how to wield the power of all of the libraries available for those languages and do cool things. Once you can look at code from a language you haven't worked in before and understand what it's doing, THEN go learn html/CSS/JavaScript/SQL.  Please don't learn PHP or Javascript as your first language. Those languages are really bad, everyone knows it and puts their fingers in their ears. You will be a better programmer if you learn Python first."

As you know, once you stop coding for a year or more you get rusty. Plus Java was object oriented whereas, as I understand web development languages are pretty different.   I think I'd be alright going the HTML - CSS - JS - MySQL - Wordpress route. I have a really good HTML/CSS book which I follow pretty easily and will be following that up with the corresponding javascript book.   http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435163751&sr=8-1&keywords=html+css+books"

Open source frameworks mean that you can just grab a module for the thing you wanna do, which makes everything go a lot faster.

A popular web framework using Ruby is Ruby on Rails. It is a joy to use, and easy for beginners because it is very strongly opinionated (e.g. dictates you on where to put stuff). You will pick up HTML and CSS along the way.  An alternative is learning JavaScript and use a full-stack JavaScript framework. I recommend Meteor. I think it will become very popular in the coming decade, just as Rails did. One thing I don't like is that JavaScript is not particularly a pretty language and it can be frustrating to use.

digitalnomad,3avlxv,talkb1nary,2,Tue Jun 23 23:00:00 2015 UTC,Checked that out while at work earlier but only skimmed over it. Read over it more in depth now that I'm at home.   Do you think Wordpress development and angular JS are worth it and/or potentially more marketable then just HTML + CSS + Javascript + MySQL?
digitalnomad,3avlxv,ecb29,3,Wed Jun 24 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"HTML CSS JS, definitely learn those first, no doubt about it. I'd hold off on MySQL, you might not end up using it depending on your spin. After learning the 3:   Wordpress.  A quick-n-easy path to cash, highly recommended. If you go this route, learn MySQL. You code less in WP (unless you're a themer =  CSS); you build more through it's web interface. So if you're more for getting sites out the door in minimal effort, go this route. Angular. If you enjoy coding, give front-end dev a spin per that post (Angular & React are good choices). For this stack, use NodeJS for your server. It's JS, so you don't need to learn new stuff (compared to learning Ruby on Rails), big learning-curve-saver. Use MongoDB as your database, it's the path of least resistance for this stack. You can actually skip glueing everything together and get the whole shebang here. Or if you're feeling more experimental, try this one instead. A big benefit of learning Angular or React is you can transfer that knowledge to building mobile apps as well (see Ionic, React Native).   I personally prefer option 2 (obviously), but I love code. I come from a background of option 1 (actually using Drupal, not Wordpress) and it's really solid for dishing out websites hand over fist (read $$$); but it's pretty boring IMO. All personal preference."

digitalnomad,3au4go,leenomadic,4,Tue Jun 23 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"I looked at hackerparadise now and it seems fun, but they are different from what I am hoping for in some ways.   The biggest difference is that they charge 300 USD/week to 750 USD / month from joiners, I am not planning to charge anything, we will simply be friends and family.   A second big difference is that they seem to have scheduled days like below, while I want it to be a free thing where you wake up and some people who want to will go for a drive and look for lions while some other people maybe go play with and help the kids at a childrens home while some sleep in or go to the swimming pool and some go shoot a youtube video together.  Free life, little stress and always friends and ""family"" around. :)  But I would be open to hook up with hackers paradise somewhere some time at some point, maybe collaborate.  edit: Here is a sample day in the Life (from hackersparadise):  •7am - yoga, jogging, reading, etc. •8am - breakfast with friends from the trip •9:30am - check-in with mastermind group •9:45am - start morning work session •1pm - lunch at a nearby restaurant or cafe •2pm - work, work, work •6pm - talk from one of the participants •7pm - dinner and hanging out with the group •8pm - games, movies, or nightlife"
digitalnomad,3au4go,leenomadic,2,Thu Jun 25 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"I happened to work in the same coworking space with them for a few weeks in Chiang Mai, Thailand and could observe how they worked and teamed up, it looked really great, I could see a very high productivity every single member of the team performed in their working sessions. And I, at a time, curiously thought of joining them until I saw the site and wondered why the hell I would pay them just to have a company. With the same amount of money, I would pay a girl in Thailand to have some fun and eliminate the loneliness instead.  And yes, I agree with you, I don't want to get into a routine and hate to force myself to do the same thing at the same time everyday, so that schedule definitely won't work for me.  I'd love to be a part of group of 2 or 3 digital nomads to sync up travel plans, share the cost of renting, share the experiences, languages, cultures, etc... and maybe become a wingman for each other :) don't necessarily need a group to help me work better, harder, because by being a digital nomad I technically take working and business less serious to spend time enjoying travelling and seeing different faces, otherwise I would have been staying home to be a boring office man.  However if you want to work better and be in a group of hard working like minded geeks while travelling, I'd recommend you to join teams like HackerParadise."

digitalnomad,3anko4,marymei,8,Sun Jun 21 23:45:03 2015 UTC,"There are definitely online opportunities for more semi-stable jobs like freelancing depending on your skillset. You could grab bite-sized projects off elance or odesk. Then there are less skill-intensive options such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, usertesting.com, various online tutoring sites, etc. All of these are very flexible ""put in a day here or there"" options. Or if you're really skilled at something, take on higher paying consulting engagements every once in a while. If you are truly happy with $5K/year, one small engagement = a year of subsistence for you.  Passive income is a whole other topic... the short answer is that absolutely you could do it. In addition to my consulting I have multiple passive income streams which come to many times your $5K/year requirement. But passive income isn't ""get rich quick"", it's more putting in a lot of work upfront to get on-going income later. You have to be willing to create something that can generate this passive income, and that takes a certain level of labour, inguenity, patience, etc. It's surprisingly easy and surprisingly difficult all at the same time.  The big warning with this type of ultra frugal lifestyle (congrats by the way, it's impressive) is that unless this is backed up by some savings, it's a very brittle lifestyle - it won't take much unexpected events to destroy your finances. Even a minor medical problem like needing a root canal or new eye glasses could be a catastrophe.

Rather than deciding in advance exactly how much money I allow myself to spend per year/month/day I am simply careful to pull in more money than I spend each quarter.  I built myself a solid reputation as a freelancer and have developed relations with a trustworthy development shop in Eastern Europe. The result is that I work between 2 and 20 hrs per week. Just like my workload, my monthly income is very irregular, but I think it's all about keeping your eye on the bank account and spending as little as possible as long as you live in a way you find comfortable.  As for places to stay, I think Van Dwelling is the best stable base to have, and whilst traveling I like to stay with friends for 1 to 2 weeks a time. It's just long enough to have a good time with them without anyone feeling like I'm trying to freeload off their situation (which I'm not, I just really like spending time with friends).

We have now had house sits in 5 different counties on 3 continents.  Out of the 400+ days traveling 50% of the time we have been in a house sit where there were no accommodations costs, it has really made a difference on how we travel.  My wife wrote a blog post on how to get your first house sit if you are interested, she also wrote a 7 day e-course that will give you everything you need to know to get started.  This is the post and if you want more info sign up for the course in the sidebar. http://expatexperiment.com/5-things-get-first-house-sit/  If you want to check out the sites the ones we use are Trusted House Sitters, HouseSitMatch and Housecarers.   Don't hesitate to ask if you have any other questions"

digitalnomad,3anko4,ruspow,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:46:27 2015 UTC,"I was there for a month in 2013 and found things were def expensive re: accommodation, cafe/restaurant food and fresh veg & fruit. But I hitchhiked, ate expired dried food (you can ask to get it free at bonus) and camped everywhere. So I spent very, very little. Your laws on hitchhiking and camping on private property are awesome!   Just a note that the countries I listed aren't cheap to 'live in', but they're easy to be 'on-the-road'. Hope that clears things up! :)"
digitalnomad,3anko4,toozler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:00:56 2015 UTC,Ah I see. Big difference there then. I'm only working/traveling here for the summer. I work at a cafe/guesthouse (not at the point where I can DN) and get lots of time off to travel so I've been amazed at how easy it is to hitchhike. I usually stock up on food from the cafe so expenses are low but the few occasions when I do have to buy stuff...my pocketbook cringes.

Travel hack miles? No, I don't really care about any reward.  I get paid 100% via Paypal and always store about US$1k in my balance to pay for flight tickets and accommodations, I avoid paying with my card because it's not in USD currency.  I use my credit card to withdraw cash from ATM's, the fee for each transaction is about 6% for me, but when I invoice my clients with Paypal, I add them 10% for a thing called ""handling fee"", so it's fair, and they have no problem with that.  I usually keep 1k USD of cash in a safe place but rarely access into it. It's another backup source, used when I have problems with my cards or pay for VOA, or to show as a proof of funds at immigrations.  I have 3 cards with me put in different places, just in case I lose one, I'll have others to get cash."

Santiago Chile, QUito Ecuador, Buenos Aires Argentina...your dollars can last much longer..  If you are going to do the US, I would say the South East is your cheapest bet, NE and PNW can be expensive (though Portland is still relatively cheap). Texas can be cheap as well."

digitalnomad,3amlxg,pushforwards,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:22:26 2015 UTC,"I'd think about what cultures / countries / languages your interested in exploring, then pick out the top ones and spend 1-3 months each in several cities (leave sooner if you hate it, stay longer if you love it). You'll find most people in this sub recommend SEA and especially Chang Mai. But really the question should be about what place you'd like to see.  This page is your friend:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Australian_citizens  Other things to consider: Do you want to stay in longer-term accommodations (local short-term apartment rentals or airbnbs), hostels, or hotels? There are benefits and drawbacks to each both price-wise and social-wise. Do you want to be able to make local friends? Doing so takes time, but by the same token leaving friends you've grown close to over 3 months can be emotionally taxing. But by that measure, traveling for such a long period alone can be taxing emotionally regardless. Do you want to speak English only or spend serious amounts of effort learning local languages? The ease with which you can ""survive"" with just English varies from country to country. The ease with which you can make local friends with just English also varies.  There's lots of questions to ask yourself, but the thing is there's really no right or wrong answers. There are definitely cheaper ways to do things though (biggest tip is to figure out what local prices are especially for accommodation and don't pay the foreigner/tourist price, but this can be difficult. easier done if you book just a week anywhere and the spend a few days visiting apartments to book something longer-term.) Most everything else is pretty subjective though. Do you prefer going to Stockholm, Buenos Aires, Berlin, NYC, a remote fishing village in Greece, a medium-sized city in Poland (one of my favorite places I lived)? Do you want to learn Spanish or Chinese? Do you want to save a ton of money by living minimally in India? Do you want to try to date Colombian women (or men) or Russians? Do you want to find a great Muay Thai gym to train at in Thailand or a BJJ studio in Brazil? Those are some of the motivations that should guide you in my opinion. Figure out what types of experiences you'd love to have and then go live for a while and make them happen. Or think about some place you might dream of living forever in an alternate reality and find out for yourself if it lives up to that fantasy."
digitalnomad,3amlxg,istorical,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:55:11 2015 UTC,"There's really a huge range based on what lifestyle you're looking for.  I'd recommend to find a sweet spot by setting an intial target $/month based on what you think will be comfortable for you.  Then look for places in that range and see if you need to adjust your spend up or down.  Another possibility is to influence your average spend by the balances you spend in expensive cities and in less expensive cities.  For example, you could offset some of your time in Amsterdam, Paris, and Milan with time in Krakow, Budapest, or Berlin."

digitalnomad,3ah5dt,Justachillday,11,Sat Jun 20 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"Stick it out. It's best not to make any rash decisions when under culture shock. First time I traveled alone, I had such high expectations it was inevitable that they would not be met. I made a lot of phone calls home in my first month, and was very home sick. However, I stuck it out and traveled for 7 months. After the 4th month, I really entered an open-minded state of less expectation which really improved things. I think it's not unusual to idealise long term travel as an escape from boredom/yourself/the human condition. But the truth is, it's not an escape, it's a change of environment. For those of us with itchy feet, change of environment stimulates and refreshes us, but it's not ever predictable, and it doesn't fix personal problems. You're still you, just in a different place. So just stick it out and I promise you you'll get used to culture shock, and you'll get to know yourself a bit better. Have fun :)"

There's a documentary about a group of boys who grew up in Sudan, where it was dangerous and where they had nothing, they were forced to flee by an oppressive government and eventually got repatriated in the U.S.  When they got to America, they missed Sudan, U.S society was so different and they thought it was unfriendly, insular and robotic.   It just takes a while to adjust to something so radically different."

digitalnomad,3ah5dt,Techynot,5,Sat Jun 20 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"Don't give up. It's an overwhelming mix of feelings from different directions. What you experience as a shock and foreign now is what will turn into excitement and pleasure after you get used to it. It will strengthen you as a person, you will learn a lot about who you are. You will develop a deep confidence that everything is going to be fine over time. Now your usual social infrastructure no longer works for you, except by accident. You don’t get friends for free just because you go to school, have a job or belong to a bowling league. You improvise. You find some social contact at a coffee shop. You go for long walks and learn to appreciate solitude more. You become more closely attuned to your personal bio-rhythms. You nap. You have left your class room or cubicle for the wide world, but you pay the cost. You have to learn to survive in the social wilderness. Much of it is as bleak as the deep open ocean, where it takes the personality of the oceanic white-tip shark to survive. But it's all worth it.  The initial phase is different for everyone. Depending on your upbringing, cultural background, preferences and so on. There are mainly two kinds of mindsets I am aware of in this case and they have an opposing polarity:    running from (Example: I don't want to be poor anymore. Negative polarity.) running towards (Example: I want to become wealthy. Positive polarity.)   I don't know your age or gender, how you grew up etc., but it seems you didn't really have to stand on your own so far. This is something inevitable to happen in your life that you will have to face at one point or the other. And that in and of itself can seem scary at first.   If you have truly negative feelings and doubts, feel really down and just want to talk, don't hesitate to pm me."

Also, you might be a bit ungrateful as your name     You can pretty much visit all of the tourist attractions that Chiang Mai has to offer in a couple of days.   Spent 7 months there, I still feel there's a lot of things I haven't seen yet.   I havn't met any hospitable Thais   There are some barriers in between thais and farang, that's for sure. But they're pretty naive and hospitable. Maybe saying that they are not hospitable might be just a matter of personal experience?   The city lacks creativity as it is apparent with vendors selling the same shit as their neighbors a few meters away at the same prices too.   I don't know where do you come from, but the first time I've been to London I've thought that everywhere there were the same franchise shops. It didn't make me think though that there's lack of creativity around.   I think the best way to describe them is that they are opportunists who are always looking to make money off of you.   Why is that so? If you are there and posting here, that means that you work, so you understand the value of money. So why are you ranting about them being opportunists? You're growing your business or freelancing in a cheaper country. You're the opportunist in the first place. So why rant about others?   I have been living here for almost a week now,   Ok, maybe that explains everything.   and I have been disappointed with my experience at the ""best digital nomad city.""   I'm pretty sure someone has given CMX the title of best digital nomad city, but - you know : those are only ""personal"" opinions.   or perhaps start all over at a new country, like Taiwan or Cambodia.   Remember when you were talking about dumpster juice and flea-ridden dogs? Well, that's Cambodia ._. It's one of my favourite places to be on the planet, too."

When I've been there the first time, I had just turned 20 and only had the opportunity to skim through the city. Last time I had enough time to explore and hang with a couple of expats. The city has got character and the traffic felt not as mad as it felt in '09. Still high on the list of places where i want to move (all of cambodia). Also, Khmers have proven to be such interesting characters and wildly more open compared to modern day thais."

A lot of the problems you mention aren't unique to Chiang Mai, rather they're pretty much the same in most developing countries. What I'd say is that the frustration you're feeling has nothing to do with Chiang Mai but rather it's an effect of culture shock. When I first started travelling I would have similar feelings quite often. Now though I've learnt to look past these surface annoyances. Your outlook is quite pessimistic at the moment and I feel the more you let this get to you the less you'll enjoy things. Really the city isn't making you feel bad, it's you that is doing that. Every place in the world seems shit when you want it to be."

digitalnomad,3adpg2,whatisupwithmyskin,14,Fri Jun 19 13:28:45 2015 UTC,"I found the same thing when I first travelled around south east Asia - It's easy to feel disillusioned by the constant vibe that all locals are trying to scam you and the streets are dirty and smell like sewerage and the stalls are all selling crappy junk and the shops have no lights and etc etc. But after a while (a few months maybe)... Suddenly, you feel it deep in your belly and you realise you're just inextricably and entirely in love.   There's so much more to south east asia than those things I mentioned before, but those things are totally a part of the experience as a farang, and it would be unproductive to try to remove them from your view of the whole experience. Just stick it out, I think you'll start to love it. And it's not that all the locals are scammers or trying to trick you... It's just that some are and they're the ones that are most visible to you right now because they're approaching you , while all the normal locals are just going about their lives.  There are also some tricks that can help you though: the body language for 'no thank you, not interested' in south East Asia is a side-to-side wobble of the hand (in Australia it's the hand gesture that means 'so-so' or 'kind of'). That can really help when Street vendors are approaching you because it shows you're not just a tourist. Also learning the Thai words for no thanks will help.   Another thing is that, making eye contact or smiling when telling someone trying to sell you something 'no thanks' is actually indicating 'yes, I want to barter/I'm pretending I don't want it so you'll lower the price'. So if you really don't want to buy, say 'no', do the hand wobble, and just don't make any eye contact. It feel incredibly rude to me still but it's a body language lost-in-translation thing."
digitalnomad,3adpg2,Bad_Karma21,5,Fri Jun 19 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"When I first visited Chiang Mai, I had a very similar experience as you describe.   I had spent a few weeks being a beach bum at a wonderful hidden spot on Koh Phangan.  After experiencing the debauchery of the Full Moon Party, however, I felt pretty down on SEA.  It felt like I traveled halfway around the world just to be surrounded by the people I couldn't stand back home.  As soon as I touched down in Chiang Mai, I went for a walk around the hotel.  I found an amazing street market that stretched for a half a mile.  The sights, sounds, and smells brought a literal tear to my eye.  I suddenly remembered why I love traveling, and then a few days later, riding a motorbike up to Pai, Chiang Mai permanently found a place in my heart."

Where in the world in Chiang Mai are you or are you the sort of person who looks for confirmation bias without actually digging below the surface?  Have you been out to Mae Rim, been up the hill, actually explored some of the amazingly cheap food Chiang Mai has to offer, and that includes food from around the world? Have you walked one of the weekend walking streets, noticed that stalls sell everything from hamburgers to Turkish pizza and kebabs, tried Lanna Thai food (which is different to standard Thai.)   Walked through Wororot Market, walked the Ping, even taken in Loi Kroh (not everyones favourite) or Nimman at night?   Am I being unjustly hard on Chiang Mai?   I don't think you're really trying. You cannot humanly see everything in a day. As for it being touristy it sounds like you're staying in a touristy part of town. There are plenty of parts of Chiang Mai that aren't.   You don't mention what you're looking for, but I'm going to presume you're young, probably more into nightclubbing or what not (Chiang Mai doesn't have a great nightclubbing scene) because culture and exploring the food bores you, so I'd suggest checking out Bangkok."

digitalnomad,3adpg2,Ohuma,6,Fri Jun 19 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"All the vendors do sell same things. Are you kidding yourself?   If by non-food vendors, Saturday Walking Street (Wau Lai) on Saturday is more crafty than Sunday Walking Street. Both have different ranges to what you see in the Night Bazaar (which I'm the first to admit is a massive tourist trap.) Wororot Market that primarily caters to Thai's have a completely different range again, and there are other markets again.   Food vendors again can be diverse, I often only go to Saturday/ Sunday walking streets so I can get some different fare.  Shopping centres... well, there's not a huge difference between the two Centrals, Kad Suan Kuay tends to have cheaper stuff, Maya did nothing for me but it's a different line up to the Centrals.    Which part of Chiang Mai do you recommend living?   I live South of the moat which is a little more quiet (except Saturdays) and is more Thai centric, but likewise I can walk to the touristy areas if I want to, or grab a Songteaw. I don't ride a bike or drive, but if I did go a bit further out in most directions, (particularly the other side of the Ping) and it's not touristy at all. Have a few friends who live further out, it's nothing like the center of town.  NW I'd presume around Nimman, it's not so much touristy vs seriously geared towards students from CMU, which is why I know younger Digital Nomads rave about the area.  Was actually at Kafe Vino opposite Maya for drinks with a friend last night....it is a pleasant area (Kafe Vino also probably has the cheapest wine in CM as well) but I'm late 30s so living there isn't really my scene."

NW part of CM is the way to go and inside the moat and just east of it is tourist Mekka (to be avoided) If you think people are unfriendly in Chiang Mai you should avoid Phuket at all costs.

The same elsewhere.  What intrigues me is that you still want to give Thailand a go -- in a city that has the same characteristics you loathe (Phuket). I am not a digitalnomad, but I've lived in a few countries and have visited about 25 countries all together.  It seems like you're going to need constant stimulus. For that I suggest you go to a large city in a country with many other sights to see.  I don't know what your budget it is, but Bucharest is one of the cheapest countries I've ever been to, sans Albania. It is a large, lively city with many events and good food. Romania contains so many interesting places that you'd never get tired. Oh, and Romania boasts the 2nd fastest internet in the world...

The key points to know is that the city is cheap. It is in close proximity to other fun areas (like Mamaia beach) and to historic cities like Timiasoara, Brasov, Cluj. You're also in very close proximity to other nomad heavens like Varna and Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Like I mentioned before, the internet is the 2nd best in the entire world. The women are nice, too. Old town is where all the fun is. City is really well-connected and even after dark you can Uber anywhere you want for super cheap.  I couldn't tell you what it is like in the winter, but it is amazing weather in the summer time."

digitalnomad,3adpg2,yuekit,6,Sat Jun 20 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"The whole area smells like dumpster juice with flea-ridden dogs sleeping on the sidewalks and cockroaches casually spotted in luxury-graded apartments.   Welcome to SE Asia. If you are expecting a Western level of cleanliness you will be disappointed not just in Chiang Mai but most places. For many the chaos is all part of the charm though. If you want a clean and modern city, try Singapore or Seoul.   Also the internet here is so spotty, and unfortunately it means you have to go to coffee cafes and work spaces to get anything done, which is probably one of the bigger turn-off's for me.   Like anywhere, that totally depends on where you are staying. Almost every hotel or apartment I stayed at in Chiang Mai had really great internet, better than your average hotel in a big American city. So you may have just been unlucky in choosing a place. Internet at cafes is generally really good too. You can also get a data plan if you have an unlocked phone or mifi device.   I have been thinking about moving to Phuket. I have heard of bad things about this place regarding to how it is so ""touristy,"" but honestly Chiang Mai feels that way too. Phuket seems appealing because there are more things to do, especially on the beaches.   Phuket does have beaches, and there are more clubs, nightlife and girls. You can go on tours to the nearby islands which are visually stunning. But it's not a big city either. If you want endless things to do, try someplace like Bangkok or Saigon (but be prepared for a certain level of dirt and chaos). If you want a more exotic setting and beaches, try Bali."

TH is not really for everyone, and there are definitely a lot of downsides. A lot of people, including here, hype it up as paradise on earth, and there's no such place. Also a lot of people seem to be butthurt by someone not enjoying their precious TH, which is ridiculous -- everyone has places that better suit their personalities and places that are just not for them.   But it can be a pretty awesome place if you have a better idea how to take it. I was also bored by Chiang Mai, but I loooved Bangkok for the longest time, and I also lived in a tiny village in Issan, as well as spent a bunch of time in Krabi. What type of stuff do you like to do? What are your interests, hobbies? There's for sure a part of TH that can suit you better. Krabi is AMAZING for outdoorsy people: climbing, hiking, sea kayaking, amazing southern Thai food. Bangkok is great for city people: shopping, the art scene, the clubbing scene, trying new restaurants. Issan is cool if you like old culture, nature, quiet life, and probably alchoholism. That's a super cool thing about TH: there's so much variety within the same country.   Cool things you could become interested in: THE FOOD! You could learn Thai massage, or join a local gym, or learn Muay Thai, I loved checking out all the food fairs that happened all the time. You'll never have such a chance at perfect photography in your life! When I lived in Issan I got a cheap bike and rode it around at sunset in the countryside, the landscapes were insane. You could learn how people grow rice. Attend all the temple fairs (these are always super cool!). Get into morlam and other Thai country music (very unique).  If you don't like touristy stuff and scams, stay awwwwwayyyy from the islands, especially places like Phuket, where the scams are a million times worse. Also, even if you stay in Chiang Mai, try to find an ""everyday"" thing to do, like a gym, or some kind of club, that you could meet everyday people at, not Thais who work in the tourist industry --- a lot of them are jaded assholes, and they wouldn't get away with their behavior amongst normal Thais either.   While I don't agree with the people commenting: ""Chiang Mai is great, something is wrong with you!"" if you've just arrived, it's possible it's just a shock and if you give a few more weeks you'd start to get into the rhythm of the place. Or you could just say ""eh"" and try somewhere else."

Can you recommend a place to live if I was pursuing productivity (like fast internet or work spaces although I prefer to just work from home), muay thai, and gyms? I think my problem is that I am only seeing 1 part of Chiang Mai as I live in the SE part close to the Night Bazaar.   From doing searches, it seems that most Muay Thai camps are south of the city. But then you have work spaces on the west side on Niman road. As for good quality gyms that would allow me to do free weights and whatnot, I guess those are rare to begin with.   I keep hearing that Phuket is bad so I guess I will stay away from there"
digitalnomad,3adpg2,jonez450reloaded,0,Fri Jun 19 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"I know Bangkok way better than Chiang Mai (I've only been to CM for a week and was bored), so I hope some Chiang Mai locals could chime in with info on those.   I prefer working from home than coworking spaces also...in Bangkok I rented a condo and I negotiated with the owner to have the fastest possible internet connection put in. It wasn't awesome, but it was ok. I think connections must surely be faster now. If you're renting a short term place the connection is probably already there, you can ask if it's shared and with how many people, I use speedtest on my phone to test how fast it is.   If you think there's a chance you might grow to like CM, it might be worth spending a few days visiting different parts of the city: go look at some apartments, go look at some Muay Thai gyms, see which neighborhoods give you a good vibe, have good coffee, food, make you feel excited to be there.   I'm not sure but I think a lot of Muay Thai gyms might have some weights you can use. Also a lot of Thais work out in parks because it's nice year round, I've seen some bodybuilders dudes that have a very outdoor ""ghetto gym"" (like barbells with concrete or something) in parks in Bangkok, and some of them are fairly swole. I feel like there must be some good gyms in Chiang Mai if you look around. Or check out the Thai expat boards.   Also if you can get a good place, I feel that's pretty central to having a good Thailand experience...when you're having a bad day and everyone tries to rip you off, or you're stressed or too much culture shock...having a little oasis with a pool and good food and internet to retreat to makes a world of difference. Good luck!"

People tend to like Chiang Mai because   It's cheap It has good weather It's easy to be productive In a self fulfilling sort of way it's easy to meet other nomads   The only things that stand out as wrong to me in your post is that you can visit all the tourist attractions in one day (a lot of the cool stuff are day trips) and that the ""Internet connection is spotty"". Getting your own line set up is extremely easy even for the short term and the providers over deliver on speed while charging low prices. So working out of your apartment is definitely viable and many do.   Other than that you just seem to have different priorities in what you're looking for so a change of location could be good."

Yes, the Thai can be pretty racist towards outsiders but in my experience it isn't always undeserved. Think about if your home country was the number one destination for douches worldwide. There are a lot of great people in Thailand but there are a lot of people here for the wrong reasons as well.  That said, you might try checking out Bangkok. I live here now and it's got a lot more going on than Chiang Mai, just not as many DN's. If you're the type that wants/needs a constant change of scene then you might like it here."
digitalnomad,3adpg2,EllenPaoSucksCock,0,Fri Jun 19 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"Honest question: why is Bangkok so great? I have a strong imagery of hookers and night clubs when I think of Bangkok, but obviously there's gotta be more to it than that"
digitalnomad,3adpg2,launchrocket,2,Fri Jun 19 14:14:55 2015 UTC,"There are like 3 or 4 streets (Alleys Really) in Bangkok that are known as Red Light areas. For the most part the red light stuff stays there. There are a lot of nightclubs in those areas that cater more to the red light clientele and there are some areas with normal nightclubs as well.  The rest of the city is extremely diverse and has everything you'd expect from a modern large city. Some nice areas, others not so much. Right now a lot of expats/nomads seem to live on the Sukhumvit between Thong Lo and On Nut BTS (Skytrain) stations and there are a lot of expat/nomad type places around there (Co-Working, Coffee Shops, Bars Etc...) that remind me of some areas of Chiang Mai.  Ultimately no city is perfect but don't judge Bangkok too harshly until you've been here. And definitely don't just go to Khao San Rd and decide that is representative of the rest of Bangkok.   For me personally Bangkok is the right combination of crazy and interesting while still allowing me to get work done. For others Chiang Mai fits the bill and some prefer the Islands in the south. It's dirt cheap to travel around Thailand, check out some areas and decide which one is right for you before you commit to something long term."
digitalnomad,3adpg2,jonez450reloaded,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"It's more of a huge city and it's easy to access the non-touristy parts of it. It's huge and dirty and messed up, but also dense and fascinating. Once I counted that within a 15 minute walk of where I lived there was:   a muay thai gym a badmington gym for ladyboys the best fresh food market (where chefs shop) in BKK, you had to cross a canal on a boat you paid 3B to take a huge equestrian center for the military, where you can take lessons a stunning, non-touristy temple -a regular food fair for government employees, some of the best food in town, like traditional sweets decorated with real gold a super downmarket gay prostitution street a cockfighting ring   ... there's always all kinds of super interesting, weird stuff to discover. Like you can visit the flower market at 11pm, and see orchids, not by the ones to twos, but entire pickup trucks filled with orchids.   The prostitution in Bangkok gets to be a bit much, honestly, but there's a lot more to the city than that."
digitalnomad,3adpg2,EllenPaoSucksCock,6,Fri Jun 19 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"Well, Chiang Mai isn't brilliant and you're right on a lot of points, but as far as Thailand goes it's a pretty nice place to be compared to Phuket I'd say.  Depends on what you're looking for though really, like anywhere.  Spot on about Thai people, while obviously a generalisation, farang are  typically seen as outsiders and pretty much not trusted or ripped off whenever possible. If you learn Thai you'll actually hear some of the bad things said about you/farang when they don't think you can understand, which isn't nice, but tbh that is Thailand. It's just one of the things you gotta accept. That said, I've experienced great hospitality and been helped many times by Thai people. Once I broke down on a road outside the city a bit and a random Thai guy came over, told me to wait, then came back 10 mins later with a toolbox and fixed my bike. So while the general feeling can be unwelcoming a lot of the time, many people are genuinely friendly and helpful.  There are plenty of good things about Chiang Mai though. If you're bored of all the touristy spots and the digital nomad hangouts like Nimman, jump on a bike and drive. Look for other places. Spend an afternoon at a lake or something, go play golf, do stuff that doesn't involve wifi and elephant pants.   I think the constant raving about Chiang Mai does it no favours personally, but you can find pretty much anything and any activity if you get away from the usual places. At its core though it is a tourist city.  It just comes down to what you enjoy doing.  Cambodia (PP) is rough and ready and has far more character IMO, the people are friendlier for sure, but again has its downsides. Worse infrastructure, more corrupt etc.. But it depends on what you're looking for.  Also a week is no time at all, you've barely scratched the surface. The usual tourist and DN hangouts make up like 0.0001% of what Chiang Mai has to offer, step outside that bubble and explore."
digitalnomad,3adpg2,jonez450reloaded,4,Fri Jun 19 15:11:19 2015 UTC,I was thinking about moving to Nimman. I am currently at the SE part Chiang Mai and it is too touristy in my taste. I don't really mind Thai people being the way they are. It is just that there are so many ravings about Chiang Mai that I had came with high expectations. It is like that movie Avatar if you know waht I mean.
digitalnomad,3adpg2,launchrocket,3,Fri Jun 19 08:04:57 2015 UTC,"this might finally get to the bottom of the mystery as to why you're finding Chiang Mai negative the way you do: you're somewhere around Loi Kroh/ Night Bazaar area.   If I came to Chiang Mai for the first time and that's the first place I stayed, I'd probably come to the same conclusion as you.  That area IS NOT CHIANG MAI. It is the tourist trap part of CM.   Grab a Songteaw or tuktuk and go wander around Nimman (again I'm presuming you're fairly young) and I think you'll find a whole different side to CM."
digitalnomad,3adpg2,dageshi,6,Fri Jun 19 13:05:16 2015 UTC,Any apartments you recommend in that area?

My residence South of the Moat I pay around 10k baht a month for (including utilities, which are extra on long term stays) but I'm in one of the better rooms (you can pay less in the building) and the complex has room service, cafe, bar/ general store, pool + gym, plus I have a proper Western bathroom, decent size fridge, microwave, and cable included in that. Internet is 400 baht a month, but it's super quick.   You can go as low as 4-5k from what I've read around Nimman, but I'd suggest looking for a more Nimman area specialist. Maybe post on /r/ChiangMai or r/Thailand."
digitalnomad,3adpg2,dageshi,2,Fri Jun 19 14:12:39 2015 UTC,Why do you live south of the moat? I guess there are muay thai camps out there. Do you close access to gym facilities and work spaces?
digitalnomad,3adpg2,EllenPaoSucksCock,0,Fri Jun 19 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"There might be Mauy Thai camps, I have no idea. I do have a gym though, which I occasionally use, but I should use more.  To be honest with you accident: first time I came to CM was for 2.5 weeks, had no idea about anything, ended up in a place literally on Wau Lai. Subsequent visits (before I started being here longer term) I tried various parts of town, Western part of the old city (don't bother, there's not a lot there,) Thae Pae Gate area (full of backpackers, not entirely unpleasant) and one time on a Soi off Loi Kroh, the worse place and area I've ever stayed in CM.  I've never actually stayed in Nimman because probably like you given where you're staying, I looked at a map and the ""touristy"" places and thought it was a bit far out.   I plead age on Nimman, but who knows, I may well have fallen in love with the area if I'd ever stayed there, and there are MANY people here on /r/DigitalNomad who swear by it.   I looked for long term places at a reasonable price, but not with a seriously low price because I wanted the extras, I wanted to be comfortable, and hence I ended up just south of the Chiang Mai Gate, a lot to do with the online reviews of the place I stay at, while nearly everywhere else I considered was around Nimman.   I like the area, it's fairly slowly paced but there are 3 7-Elevens and a Tesco Lotus <500m away, a nice but not huge night food market (yes, complete with the best and cheapest hamburgers in CM, Turkish pizza and Kebab,) and as I've mentioned before, it's easy to walk to the touristy areas if I want to, or likewise like last night jump in a tuktuk for 100 baht and get dropped off at Kafe Vino opposite Maya for a drink with a friend.    work spaces   I've been tempted given what I've read here and elsewhere to try them out, but I have excellent internet access, and I primarily work the mornings, sometimes into the early afternoon, and to be honest when I quit working in a corporate environment (I haven't been a digital nomad for ever, but I haven't had a corporate job for 11 years..ie, I've worked externally) I kind of like being able to work alone. Might make me somewhat sad, and I see the benefits in co-working, but I'm happy pottering along as I do, and although I wouldn't say I have dozens of friends in Chiang Mai, I have people I know at various levels that might include the casual drink, or more, so I'm not exactly cut off from the world.   It all comes down to your tastes. Again, check out Nimman, I think it might fit what you want better, particularly given where are you staying now."

One week and you're an authority in what to see in a city you've never been to?  Chiang Mai is 2,905 km2 (1,122 sq mi). Covered that in a day on your bike did ya'? While the sewage system isn't modern, it's an occasional sewer grate that stinks, not the entirety of the city. Spotting a cockroach in an apartment, doesn't condemn a city. I suggest you never travel to a tropical country if you have problems with bugs.  Vendors sell what tourists want, and since you're clearly spending time near tourist areas, you're clueless as too what the city is actually like. Fastest Internet I've ever had. 16Mbps down, 3Mbps up. Shared wireless in my apartment building, that's included in my $123 a month rent. Spotty Internet in your building doesn't condemn the city, and it must be a terrible turn off working in the garden or in an air conditioned coffee shop for the price of a coffee. Boo-Hoo. Tourist businesses are supposed to make money off of tourist opportunities. What exactly should they be doing for you? No doubt after a week here your Thai language skills consist of Sawadee Kha/Khap. So rather than consider that asking for help in english might not get you a helpful or english response, you'll just condemn the people of Thailand as being unfriendly? Genius. Yes you are a ""farang"" and the worst kind. An inconsiderate westerner who expects that their way is the correct way. A farang who bad mouths and entire city, because its not western, and who clearly has no experience traveling or embracing a foreign culture.

So, yeah, I'd say slamming Thai culture and the second largest city in the country, with a weeks worth of experience is incredibly fucking unjust. If OP wants advice I suggest it starts with asking fucking questions, not soapboxing ignorance."

Go read some more comments with op I've had; I finally got where he's coming from and how to try to fix it, but you know what, the comment your replying to is accurate in every single way.   Nothing to do with hivemind, everything to do with a complete lack of perspective about how the parts of the world is outside the US/ Australia or the UK.   Op himself admits to having only traveled elsewhere to Korea.   I've actually come around to op in other comments on this thread, not agreeing with his original but understanding given he's staying somewhere in Loi Kroh/ Night Bazaar area and that's why he has his perspective, and even encouraging him to visit other areas of CM, so don't go the bullshit line that it's some sort of group think.

He went in hard on CM having been here a week being in the shittiest part of CM and then applying that to the whole town.   I don't think that's fair, and I'm pretty sure if you check other comments from him as well, he will admit that perhaps he needs to see more, fuck, I'm talking to him about moving to Nimman.   It's not tribalism to point out that if you stay in one part of town for one week and call it shit house based on that you get called out on it.   It's poor form.   But again, I now get the WHY he had that idea...perhaps you could take a minute out and understand why some people have fucked up, insular, uninformed positions on places as well?

When you can pretty much go to any tourist attraction/market in the world and essentially find the same phenomenon. You wouldn't travel to Paris, visit the eiffel tower and then complain the city ""lacked creativity"" due to the tackyness of the souveneirs in the souveneir shop.

On the other hand, wherever you are going I believe you should learn the basics of the local language. Your experiences will be incredibly better with locals. I spent a month there in November  - traveled for around 9days for the tourism and then settled for the remaining time in Dulan, Taitung on the east coast - Could remote work there and surf so that was perfect for me - internet was fast too. Language barrier was not a problem but I made sure to learn a few sentences before going to TW. In Taipei you won't have a problem with the language IMHO. For Mandarin learning try: Chinese Pod - excellent ressource and free for 30days (you can cancel after if you don't want to keep learning)."

It's easy to find fast internet all over in Chiang Mai, in fact the Internet I had a few places there, rivals the speed I have with Comcast in San Francisco. Also, some of the same tourist goods can be found in markets of SF, Taiwan, Ho Chi Minh, Phuket, Chiang Mai, etc. Living in the night market area, is like living in Fishermans warf in SF and thinking that's the culture. All cities have unique aspects that can be found with the right attitude and patience. Learn some Thai, take some cooking classes, ride a motorcycle somewhere and practice some gratitude. The charm of a place rarely has to do with tourist attractions and much more to do with the presence of life steadily lived, including your own.  If walled off cleanliness is a huge priority, Thonglor in BKK might be a better option."

I get most of my work from referrals, so the more people I have referring me the better.  I work for a couple websites. They're international and have work that needs doing everywhere, I've worked out a contract that works for both of us where I get flexibility to roam and they get hard to shoot locations shot. I got these by submitting specific portfolios aimed squarely at them, it took a while but they're in it for the long haul, and its work I don't have to market for.   Lastly I'm living in a camper van, my overhead is very low, the reality is I don't leave for another leg of traveling before I have enough gas and food money to get me out and back.

First, identify a skill that can be done primarily online that will become your career path. Then practice that skill and learn how to find work in it until you know you can reap a stable income from it. Only then think about going overseas. What you make money doing will be defined by your skills and your imagination; I think a lot of people with an entrepreneurial mindset are attracted to this lifestyle, but a lot of bulshitters too (like people who think you can make a living off writing e-books on how to make a living writing e-books...)   I'm a freelance editor, but I don't earn that much from it and there's not much chance for advancement, so I don't really recommend it as a long-term plan, though it's ok as a stepping stone.

Second, people aren't about to post about the latest project they are working on that isn't related to travel or living in various cities around the world, etc because it just isn't relevant to this sub.

digitalnomad,3acwph,rooster_booster,7,Fri Jun 19 03:26:14 2015 UTC,"Besides the points already mentioned, it's also an identity thing. The by far bigger group who lives a nomadic life doesn't identify themselves as DNs because it's just a tiny aspect of the life they live. They run SaaS, E-commerce, consulting, freelancing, outsourcing, service etc. businesses. They play poker, do affiliate marketing, day trading and many other things that have nothing to do with Digital Nomadism. Because of that they don't need or want to yell it from the roof tops. Their resources are better spent writing (if at all) about what they do and you won't see it in this small DN bubble world.  For me personally, my nomadic life is on a par with growing a beard, working out or eating. It's something that I am interested in in equal ways. I do it, I love and can read or talk about it, but I won't go ahead and start a business around it, write lengthy blog posts about or strongly identify myself with. When I shave my beard or stop working out - I'm still the same person, with the same identity and personality. When I introduce myself, I don't mention my beard (it surprisingly grew all by itself) or the fact that I work out or meditate or write code. Most of my friends are like that. DN is one small aspect of their identity and life.  I personally find extremes in identifying with a group of people very annoying. Extremely inclusive and exclusive clubs (depending on which side you are or they see you). Sects, religions, skaters, lefties, righties, anarchists, punks, hipsters, hippies, smokers, non-smokers, backpackers, pet lovers, coders, ravers... name any - I find them extremely annoying if this one thing, this one facet fills their entire space of identity.

Do any of these people have any incentive to grab a megaphone and announce what they do?  Nope.    Because of very strict employment laws and possibilities of being scammed by fellow expats or extorted by locals, they keep their mouths as shut as they practically can, trying to fly under the radar as much as they can.  Self-promotion can hurt them.    But if your strategy depends on self-promotion, then that's what you gotta do.  I know one guy running a website that supplements his income and he's always running around forums and dropping his links and building his ""personna.""  He makes about $1000/month doing this, and it makes a difference in his SE Asia lifestyle.  Another guys is always pushing a service he is providing to mostly expats...  Not sure how much he makes but he is sticking with it and trying...   Of course there's plenty of people turning to the shady things as well.  Bangkok and Manila are infamous for call center scams and pump and dump operations.  There is big money in it even for the lowly commissioned expat employees and they generally operate under protection of the local cops.  It's big business.  So is pre-selling condos and timeshares to vacationers.  I remember reading a story about a team of Westerners who got busted for running a Web Cam sexy studio.  Plenty of 'experienced' expats end up mooching off of new expats or scamming new expats.  New blood, new money coming in.    Ultimately, you look in the mirror and think about what you can do and to whom you can sell it.  If you've done medical transcriptions for 20 years in the USA, you contract with your USA clients and ""work from home.""  Home being 3000 miles away.  Instead of thinking what you can do from Cape Town, think about what you can do from your house in Canada.    ""Digital Nomad"" how-tos are just a new twist on ""Work From Home"" gimmicks, targeting and appealing to young people instead of soccer mom."
digitalnomad,3acwph,sts816,2,Sat Jun 20 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"Couple more things to what people have already said.    B2B is huge. I just did a bit of googling and couldn't find figures but it's not like B2C is by far the largest target market. You could look at any industry and see a shitload of people working on projects about working. Digital nomads lean very very heavily towards web services and consumers are particularly stingy in that regard. B2C is a very emotional and feeling based market and people for various reasons have decided it feels better to pay for things they can hold. Doesn't matter if you're making something that will give them many hours of entertainment, they'll want that advertising supported (but only easily ignorable advertisements) or they wont use it. Businesses on the other hand are a much more rational buyer. If you make a web service that benefits them then they will quite happily pay hundreds or thousands of dollars a month to use it whether it's physical or not. To a large extent the B2C digital marketplace is much more dominated by large players instead of nomadic freelancers because they have the sheer size to be able to monetise ""free"" products for stingy users and effectively then turn those products in to B2B advertising/data businesses."

digitalnomad,3a8wpk,Razaberry,4,Thu Jun 18 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"Looks a promising start, from the little I can see so far.  But one thought: Digital nomads who wave it around as a thing of pride are very cringe. Hell, most of us can't even stand to say the name ""digital nomad"", let alone want to show off about it in public. So I'm not sure that patches and decals and stickers are a good idea.  Still, I might be totally wrong about that. At the very least it's a way to get more people aware of the service, and bootstrapping the community is surely going to be your biggest challenge."
digitalnomad,3a8wpk,sobri909,0,Thu Jun 18 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  Where are you based? In places like Chang Mai and Bali, Indonesia, the term Digital Nomad is pretty common among the expat crowd."
digitalnomad,3a8wpk,sobri909,6,Thu Jun 18 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'm based in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Phnom Penh, Singapore, Shanghai, Bali, Tokyo.  I don't socialise with other digital nomads, or expats at all, for the most part. (I've never understood the desire to travel half way around the world to then spend your time with people just like yourself.) But if any of them used that term in public I'd throw up a little in my mouth. It's been discussed a few times in this sub, and the consensus has been that it's an utterly wankerish term and no one wants to self identify with it.  I can imagine it being common in Chiang Mai, because that seems to be destination #1 for freshies. It seems to draw in a crowd that I fundamentally don't understand - a crowd that talks like they want to explore the world, but also want to ensure that they're doing so in an environment that surrounds them with familiar, unchallenging people. shrug"

digitalnomad,3a8wpk,yearoftheyar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:57:35 2015 UTC,The main one is that we're global. You can find the best workspace anywhere (I'm currently in Singapore).
digitalnomad,3a8wpk,jlengstorf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:24:06 2015 UTC,workfrom is also global - accepting submissions from anywhere. It's not completely obvious from the home page as it caters to the 'featured areas' which are mostly US.
digitalnomad,3a8wpk,juellez,2,Fri Jun 19 05:33:03 2015 UTC,"Why only an app? This is something I think would be very useful, but a web-based app (at least as a companion) seems far more useful.   Most of us are searching ""best cafes to work from in ________"" — you have a large source of organic traffic to a web app if you can actually answer that question (most cities have a list that's several years old and only features the author's favorite neighborhood)."
digitalnomad,3a8wpk,JobspressoTeam,3,Thu Jun 18 10:06:29 2015 UTC,"as another commenter noted, https://workfrom.co already exists and is doing this as a web based app. they also have a community chat & meetups for folks who want to connect with other folks working from cafes."
digitalnomad,3a8wpk,Dynosmite,2,Thu Jun 18 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am the other commenter, and I'm all for similar/competing products, but WHA needs to think about adding differentiators, so that users have a reason to use it.

It sounds like you should spend most of your time in places without extradition treaties with the US!  Or you need someone to fall back on. It sounds like you've got or can find someone to answer emails if you're not around. What you need after that is someone or a company you can count on.   Then the workflow if you were out of touch would be that the non-technical person would hand off the emergency project to your contractor.    Option 1: A contractor/company   Option1 is to pay a retainer to a contractor or company, and back it up with a solid contract with an SLA that matches or exceeds your own.   Now, since your contractor is ALSO going to want to go on vacation or could end up the hospital you may want to use a company which is going to manage their employee's vacation time.    Option 2: Find a business partner / friendly competitor   If you have any trusted contacts with a similar business situation as you, you could set up an reciprocity agreement where you'll cover his off-grid time if he'll cover yours. Then you have to coordinate vacations/travel/etc. between the two of you so you're not both out of touch at the same time.   Unless you're both willing to set up a contract which assigns financial liability if the SLA slips, then this route wouldn't be as protective as Option 1, but it may be easier to set up."

digitalnomad,3a846k,marymei,2,Wed Jun 17 23:42:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a contractor for email marketing services, but I bill myself as a marketing automation consultant. Others I've seen call themselves ""demand gen"" or ""lead gen"", which always involves elements of email.  The jobs are out there somewhere. There's less small jobs for email marketing consultants, but I'd probably just look for one BIG project. I landed one with a Fortune 3 company just 2 years ago, which has continued indefinitely for oddjob projects.  I landed into the contract with luck, not skill, so your mileage may vary.  As for the personal site idea, I say you should roll with email marketing topic choice. Maybe you can write about how content marketing and email marketing synergize. I think step-by-step guides, 1,500+ words, would jive well with audiences you're looking for, but I'm unsure since I haven't written on that space.  Write about what you're good at, incorporate feedback, and get stuff done. :)"
digitalnomad,3a846k,GaleDear,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Great advice :) very much appreciated. In terms of 'BIG projects', how best do you find and identify them? Using remote work job listing sites or more so word of mouth since your first big gig?"
digitalnomad,3a846k,GaleDear,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"So here's the ""luck"" that I mentioned before... I got them via my University a few years ago. I went into a school-approved internship that was tangentially related (""marketing""), demonstrated content marketing prowess, then received my contact afterwards.  As for why I believe the space is ripe for bigger clients: I recognized that consultants at places like Marketo's Summit and Dreamforce who happened to be in email marketing all had big, BIG clients. They had no SMB email marketing clients. Only bigger orgs (either B2B consultants or eCommerce) wanted an email marketing specialists. And of course, those are two separate specialties, so choosing one would better position your skills.  So my experience with this is very personal - I cannot say for sure if these tech/marketing conferences are a correct gauge of the entire market."
digitalnomad,3a846k,GaleDear,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:40:55 2015 UTC,I think your experience has been my experience as well. Most of my current clients are large organisations/corporates in the private and public sectors. I see what you mean.

Nowadays, I am all remote... but nowadays, I also don't take on new projects. Just taking a breather!  I think it is IMPERATIVE to get a non-remote position before a remote one.

From the research I've done, and the DNs I've talked to on here and IRL, I think it's plenty of experience in terms of building experience in the field, communication skills etc. It's one of the reasons I'm now seriously beginning to build the groundwork to go DN.  On your original point, I'm also interested in seeing what works best in terms of what to bill myself as. At the moment I'm pushing the strategic consultant side (that's what I'm most interested in anyway, and I'm good at writing out this kind of thing), and looking to supplement that with project management, and eventually content management/creation.

You're never more productive than when you've got 10% battery left. I listen to instrumental music or ambient noise. Waterfalls and thunderstorms seem to be really good for me.

Definitely. mrs magictravelblog and I traveled with carry on only for around 3 years. We only started checking stuff in because we had a baby.   Mobile plan?   In Thailand you can get a sim card at 7-11s. If its quiet and you ask nicely the people working there will usually put it in for you and get you all set up. 7-11 staff can also help you recharge if necessary. Be warned you will most likely get random promotional texts which are invariably all in Thai but you can just ignore them.  Malaysia there are plenty of phone company shops around where you can get a sim card. There is a bunch of them together at KLIA 2. You will need to show your passport.   How to organise getting from the airport to the booked room/hostel?   Bangkok airport is connected to the Bangkok subway/skytrain system. Have a look at a map of the system. Google maps can do it from memory. So when you fly in you basically just keep going downstairs until you arrive at a train station, get on the train, get off at the stop near your accommodation, done :)  Try to stay somewhere near a BTS station (the sky train) or an MRT station (the subway). The two systems interconnect but you really want to be near a station for one or the other. Personally I recommend the Sukhumvit area. Anywhere along the Sukhumvit line is usually pretty nice.  Khao San is the main backpacker district. Stay there if you want to spend all of your time getting drunk with backpackers, otherwise avoid it like the plague.   but then flying to 'nearby' cities like Ho Chin Mihn city in Vietnam or Kuala Lumpur every 2-4 weeks.   It may not be worthwhile if you are going to be leaving Thailand so soon/often but consider getting a Thai tourist visa before you depart. They can give you either 2 or 3 months, I forget. Otherwise you will get 30 days on arrival. Maybe that will be enough, maybe it won't.   or Kuala Lumpur    If you want to check out Malaysia I would recommend Penang, Melaka/Malacca or Kuching. KL is fine but it lacks the personality of some of the other parts of Malaysia and it often takes people multiple visits before KL really grows on them."

digitalnomad,3a5aqq,CoffeeTheGreat,4,Wed Jun 17 11:46:27 2015 UTC,"First off, congrats on being able to travel! I've been out since February this year and I started in Bangkok too. In general, I stay in each country for about a month, but your mileage may vary. Here's my version of answers to your questions:   Google Flights has a graph that will give you a good idea of the prices each day. It doesn't list all the carriers of course and you may be able to find discounted flights that are cheaper but the discounted flights always have strings attached. Either they get in a 4 am or there are a million little surcharges. Flights to Vietnam have been the worst for surcharges for me. In general, if you can be the extra cost, it may be super worth it to take the flights that take off and arrive at reasonable times. It's the difference between being able to check into your apartment or hotel right away and walking with your pack for 6 hours. You're young though, so it may not be that big of an issue. I have about 5 days of clothes. Don't expect to be super stylish, but pack the essentials. I have about 5 V neck t shirts, 1 collared shirt, 2 pairs of shorts, and I splurged and got a pair of Rapha jeans. They're jeans meant for cycling so they dry ridiculously quickly and they look better than the pants that zip off into shorts.  I would say, to get around a 45 liter pack and a day pack. I use the Osprey Farpoint 55 and it's worked out amazingly well. The main pack is big enough to fit all my clothes and the day pack can easily fit a kindle, 15"" MBP, adapters, and a couple external hard drives. Come with every thing that you would need for at least 3 days. After that, you can buy whatever you need, especially if you're in Bangkok. 7-11s are everywhere and you can get toothpaste, shampoo, soap, deodorant, beer and anything else you need. Bangkok has H&M, Uniqlo, and sporting goods stores, so your bases should be covered. Medication is the exception. You can probably get all of your medications in Thailand, but that isn't something I would mess around with in the beginning. Thailand has pretty cheap mobile service that isn't bad. I had an iPhone 5 and was getting 3G coverage pretty much everywhere in the country at 10Mbps down and at least 2 Mbps up. Airports will have wireless carrier booths, but sometimes you can get better prices with carriers that don't set up shop in an airport. For me, I'd rather pay 20% more and have service as soon as I land then try to navigate without my precious Google Maps. At the booth, they will pop out your SIM card, give you a new one, and make sure you’re good to go. Amazon has an all-in-one power adapter that supports like 180 countries for about $10-20 USD. Get something like that. Google Maps is immensely helpful for navigation. In Bangkok, it has both walking and public transit directions. The airport has a subway train in the basement that will get you to the city. Every other airport I’ve been to has some type of bus or train system that will get you into the city proper. Decide where you’re staying before you land and make sure you coordinate with the people that run the place so you can check in immediately. It doesn’t matter how comfortable your pack is, you won’t really want to walk around with it if you don’t have to. In every city, look up a coworking space. Some have more westerners than others but if you’re going to Koh Lanta, check out KoHub. It’s a great way to meet other digital nomads and to get out of the Thai heat."
digitalnomad,3a5aqq,awesomeflyinghamster,2,Wed Jun 17 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, awesome response and very helpful, much appreciated"
digitalnomad,3a5aqq,air-,5,Wed Jun 17 14:07:30 2015 UTC,"Since you'll be staying for awhile, consider getting 4-7 days of accommodation before arrival, checking out your surroundings/coworking spaces/neighborhoods, then finding your next place once you know where you want to be. It's hard to get a good idea of where you want to live until you're on the ground. For example, Bangkok has a really big highway street Sukhumvit that you want to make sure you're on the right side of depending on where you spend most of your time. It sucks to cross it, even if you're right next to it. Don't worry about booking too late - there will be places open, and it's off-season right now.  Just pay the extra $10/night or whatever to get air conditioning and/or find a place where you don't have to hear your neighbors all the time. 300 baht a night might sound amazing, but don't kill yourself to get there. $30/night is still cheap. Like others said, pack pretty light. Bangkok is a huge cosmopolitan city with giant mega malls. You can find anything you need. Though hard stick deodorant is conspicuously missing from all of Asia... as are thong underwear. Medications definitely bring with. You can get everything over there, but it's a toss up if your pharmacist will speak good enough English to understand what you need.  Public transport is awesome. Don't bother with a taxi if you don't have to. You can get from the Bangkok airport to pretty much anywhere in the city via subway or sky train. I'd say pay a little extra and get your SIM card at the airport. Then you get Google Maps, and you have access to AirBnB if you get lost and need to contact your host. Data plans in SE Asia are cheap anyway. Power adapters are no big thing. They sell them everywhere. I wouldn't concern yourself with getting things in hand baggage. International flights will give you free baggage anyway, and the cheap flights that charge you for bags have unreasonable limits on the amount of luggage you can carry on, so you will probably be stuck paying for it anyway. Just pack what you need in a reasonably sized bag and be done with it.  Personal preference, but I'd look for areas with coworking spaces to find like-minded people. Typical travel areas (a la Bangkok's infamous Khao San road) are full of a different kind of traveler...I call them ""travel pants"" travelers. They wear big baggy butt pants, probably know nothing of computers, and are typically into meditation and magic crystals. The neighborhood we really liked was near Ekkamai/Upper Sukhumvit.  Get to Chiang Mai if you can. There's a great overnight or day train that gets you there comfortably, and the city is really neat to visit. Plus you can get an amazing bowl of Khao Soi pretty much anywhere, world-class coffee (don't miss Ristr8to), and go on a jungle trek if that's your thing."

I'm heading to Thailand in the fall to reduce expenses and fully focus my time into self paced online bootcamps to learn how to code. The immediate goal is figuring out if applying for a more intense bootcamp is right for me. It's fun to party yeah, though I'd like some space where I can be productive yet have a support system who understands what's going on."
digitalnomad,3a5aqq,resedit_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, I did a similar thing 2 years ago! In the end, I decided to study on my own and apply for an internship. I wasn't making much at the internship, but they allowed me to learn on company time. I was eventually (8 months later) moved on to full-time. Maybe try looking for internships if the bootcamps don't feel right."

In Saigon for example, there's a couple companies that are fair and the rest are likely to give you the runaround from what I've heard."
digitalnomad,3a5aqq,dageshi,2,Thu Jun 18 10:53:26 2015 UTC,"Accommodation will primarily be through AirBnB, but I won't be shy of staying a few nights in a hostel or hotel if required.   Price anywhere you're going to stay against accommodation on Agoda. In Thailand it's often cheaper to book into a guest house or if you're staying in Bangkok for the full month look for a Residence, and most residences offer a discount for a month long stay if you book with them directly."
digitalnomad,3a5aqq,niceb0y,3,Thu Jun 18 11:56:04 2015 UTC,"On flights, it's a crapshoot, earlier the better probably but who knows, you may save some money if you time it just right.. but honestly I would not agonise about trying to time your flight purchase, there isn't really a magic formula, there's just luck. Accommodation, Thailand and south east asia in general have masses of rooms. Hotel rooms, guesthouse rooms, hostels and everything in between. Most big cities (and even smaller locations) will have entire streets/districts filled with places where you can walk in, ask to see a room if you like it, book it (asking for a reduced rate on a longer stay is a good idea). If you don't like the one you're looking at, move onto the next, for the most part you don't need to book in advance except... I always book the first two nights of a place I'm flying into, well 2 nights for an international flight, 1 for a regional. When you've just spent 13+ hours on a flight you don't want to spend a load of time trying to find somewhere to stay because you're generally knackered and just want a shower... use the next day to figure out where you're going to stay going forward. Personally I carry 7 days clothing, that is at least 1 pair of clean underwear/t-shirt per day. Bangkok is super humid, you don't want to wear the same clothes (t-shirt/underwear) two days in a row. I wouldn't bother trying to get everything in hand luggage, have a small backpack for electronics/valuables and a second bag which you can comfortably carry in one hand. Luggage with wheels isn't a bad idea either. So long as you've got the basics of what you need to work and clothes e.t.c. you'll be able to purchase everything else you need there. Before you arrive in BKK print off the address of the place you're going to stay at. Preferably in the local language. Show this to a taxi driver and he'll get you there. Also you may want to get a couple thousand thai baht before you arrive in BKK incase your atm card doesn't work."

Before I begin I want to make sure that I am set up in such a way that I do not have the taxman waiting for me with hefty fines upon my return to Australia. I am not looking to avoid tax, rather simply cross my t's and dot my i's as this is all new to me. It may have even been that I used the incorrect terminology when describing what I want to achieve.  It just seemed like all the advice was targeted at someone running a business within Australia and did not go into things like being a non-resident and the like (the term non-resident even drew a blank look from one of them). If this is the best advice then by all means I will go with it but If if there is an accountant with experience dealing with digital nomads then I thought a second opinion might help."

digitalnomad,3a3mix,grungebuddy,3,Wed Jun 17 06:23:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's something we generally don't talk (or care) about in the DN community, but there's definitely this sense from people that we are ""apart"" from the world, and it's reflected in those comments.  Whether it's feeling like we force ourselves on poor countries, worrying about how lonely we must be, or just thinking we should grow up and get real (i.e. office) jobs and settle down, there's this sense that people following such a drastically different life path than the norm must be doing something wrong.  If you're rich, it's ""eclectic"" if you're a working Joe (or Jane) like most DNs, it's ""irresponsible"". There's no winning either way.  I don't have an answer for responding to those kinds of concerns, because I just don't much care about them, but this is a good reminder that they exist."
digitalnomad,3a3mix,SearchingTheDark,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, as a DN, I agree with a lot of them. Especially the immigrants/working on tourist visa bit. & the privilege, however much I hate the term.   I don't think it's people thinking we're doing something wrong, more a reaction to the pretentiousness of digital nomads thinking we're changing the world and special in some way when 90% of the time it is mostly taking advantage of cheap countries and working illegally. Hard to deny that the whole scene is pretty fucking pretentious IMO, and I say that as part of it. The article definitely has that whiff about it."
digitalnomad,3a3mix,wax_addict,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think you've had rather positive experiences to think they don't think we're doing something wrong just by choosing a different path. There's another post floating around where an asshat DN (hey, I'm agreeing THOSE exist) broke up with his supermodel girlfriend and his mother was quoted as saying ""I wouldn't want to be his girl"" all because he moves around full time. And possibly because he's an asshat, of course.  It's not unique to digital nomads, anyone who chooses a non-standard life finds some resistance. Other subreddits talk about it quite a bit more than we do, probably because they have to face it more head-on than we do, especially /r/freelance and /r/startups.   I also don't know any DNs who think they're changing the world, except for those startup guys. I've only met DNs who think they're a symptom of a changing world. That's a pretty important distinction."
digitalnomad,3a3mix,SearchingTheDark,2,Wed Jun 17 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"Well said on both posts. If you have a blog, you should link it so I can read it."
digitalnomad,3a3mix,grungebuddy,2,Wed Jun 17 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, it's not black and white.  I think maybe where people come from makes a difference in a way. I've honestly never encountered anyone who has put any real importance on, or really even cared about, traditional/right and wrong paths in life. Maybe I've been lucky, or maybe it's just the place and people where I'm from, but it's never really been a thing anyone gives thought to, people just do what they want to do, nobody is really different for not having a 9-5 in an office whatever tbh. They might be in the minority but it's still normal and nobody really cares I guess, maybe it's different in America or wherever.  I think, as you say the world has changed. I don't think anyone is really doing anything really non-standard unless they're, I dunno, trainhopping, vagabonding, joining the circus.. whatever. Hopping on a plane and working from a coffee shop in another country is basically just that. The idea that it's some wild departure from 'regular' life (and thus better) is what bugs me I think, and that is quite prevalent I've found.  You know like those people who say 'I'm a traveler, not a tourist'? Many digital nomads I've met are like the freelance version of those guys.  I'm being pretty cynical of course, and it's a broad generalisation but I can't really blame people for having views like the commenters."

digitalnomad,3a68dm,sixside,2,Wed Jun 17 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"I spent 3-week there in 2013 and didn't encounter any major connectivity issues. Most of the 'hostels' I ended up booking were more like home-stays and wifi availability was listed (and accurate) on the booking websites. At one ladies house in Anuradhapura, I had to choose between hiding out in my room where the mosquito net was, or getting a wifi signal. She also liked to turn off her wifi router at night to save electricity! She was more the exception than the rule however.   In terms of power -- this (Kikkerland UL03-A Universal Travel Adapter) is the only power adapter a digital nomad needs. It's taken me around the world without any issues. http://www.amazon.com/Kikkerland-UL03-A-Universal-Travel-Adapter/dp/B00210MRGC  The cities and villages I visited are available here to give you an idea of where I was able to connect from: http://mnml.me/travel-photography/sri-lanka/"

They made me a bit envy :)  Do this converters work only with US plugs (I am from EU)?  I was planning to get a SIM card. This would give me a backup where wifi wouldn't be available/reliable. Did you try this? My experience in Thailand was that cell data usually worked even better than wifi.
digitalnomad,3a68dm,sixside,2,Thu Jun 18 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"I believe so, you can try to Google Image search for the product to get some other views of the female side. Here's one example: https://image.rakuten.co.jp/glv/cabinet/upsix6/kik-0018-000-six_01.jpg  I did get a SIM card at the time and it was pretty easy to do and speeds were good. I never tried to tether off of it though and really only used it for maps and email.  If you're planning to go to India that is a MUCH different story when it comes to SIM cards. Due to their proximity to Pakistan (as I was told), they have tighter restrictions on SIM cards for foreigners. Getting your own new SIM card takes several days, alternatively you can probably find a used one on the blackmarket but YMMV. Just be persistent."

Digital nomads are writers, programmers, QA anlysts, project managers, entrepreneurs, visual effects artists, voice actors, journalists, affiliate marketers, and more things I probably can't think of right now. They may work freelance or they may work full time for companies. They may be 9-5ers or they may work on a flex schedule that changes depending on their timezone.  There's not really a ""digital nomad"" business. I guess that there could be some kind of backlash against remote workers that would sweep the world, but even then many DNs wouldn't be affected."
digitalnomad,3a66t8,SearchingTheDark,-1,Wed Jun 17 15:51:34 2015 UTC,That what I meant. Remote workers who work digitally. Will the amount available saturate the market it will be tougher for freelancers to get the job.
digitalnomad,3a66t8,inspireNomad,4,Wed Jun 17 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what a digital nomad is. There isn't some kind of supply, it's also not really related to freelancing either. While it is true that some digital nomads are freelancers, a lot either own their own businesses or work for another company.  You seem to think that digital nomad is synonymous with freelancing, it's not. Could the interest in becoming a digital nomad fuel an interest in freelancing which could make it harder for freelancers to find work? Possibly, but this won't stop existing workers from starting to work remotely.  Established companies are increasingly allowing users to work remote, so becoming a digital nomad might be as easy as finding a progressive tech company not just the start your own business / freelancing.  FYI I wouldn't want to be a travel nomad freelancer, I was a freelancer and the instability of income would stress me out."

digitalnomad,39zn1u,MsKim,12,Tue Jun 16 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, experiences vs possessions.  It sounds so simple.  In reality, most of the best and deepest experiences require commitment and equipment.    Is paragliding an experience or a possession?  Cause I can tell you from my storage room that there's thousands in gear tied up in it.  Sure, you can ""experience"" it once at a mediocre level by getting a tandem ride.  But if you want to pursue something deeper, you usually need to commit and it usually adds up.    I realize that someone will come up with some examples of free stuff with no-gear that they pursue on a serious level.  The point is not that 100% of things require ""possession"", but that most things do."
digitalnomad,39zn1u,witoldc,3,Tue Jun 16 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"Meh. The point of minimalism as far as travel is concerned isn't to have zero possessions, it's to have exactly what you need and not more (far less possessions than most people) so you can be portable."
digitalnomad,39zn1u,skillDOTbuild,3,Tue Jun 16 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but /u/witoldc's point is that the pursuit of experiences requires gear that makes you not portable/mobile.  Want to pursue photography on a close-to-professional level? You'll have at least 10kg in lenses, two big camera bodies, a few flashes, a tripod, a desktop workstation and some big-ass monitors...  How about the experience of playing guitar in a band? You'll need a guitar, amp, cables, pedals...  Sure, you can cut that shit down (just use a single lens with a single body and make do with available light, or stick with a single guitar and a modeller and IEM), but that really changes the experience immensely."
digitalnomad,39zn1u,sdflkjeroi342,3,Tue Jun 16 07:14:14 2015 UTC,"I would also like to mention that I like to travel, mostly on a motorcycle.  This means that I might be living out of one book-bag sized bag for months at a time.  1 pair of shoes, 1 pair of pants, etc... In fact, when I fly somewhere I usually resort to wearing all my safety gear on the plane, using my helmet as a camera/document purse.   I think I know what 'minimalism' feels like...   I also recognize that - if someone has a bottomless bucket of cash - one can just keep renting all gear as needed.  (The whole business model of renting is to make people pay more than it would cost to own it.)    It's a very limiting existence where you are always stuck making hard choices.  I can take some photography gear, or I can take some paragliding gear, or I can take my inflatable kayak gear.  But I can't do all 3.  I end up missing things.  And 90% of backpackers out there don't do shit aside from drinking in the evenings with mostly other backpackers and looking at pretty monuments and beaches during daytime as they walk around and gawk and maybe eat some street food.  I stayed at some hostels, and I saw TONS of people who just ""existed"".  Many barely went out, opting to hit the corner store for cheep booze they could get drunk on in the shared area.  They call it 1 year of experiences.  I call it existence.  Mixing in an elephant ride at the end of the month doesn't make up for it.  They will describe it as:    ""I have hiked along the Italian coast and swum in the crystal clear water of the Tyrrhenian Sea to my heart’s content.""  (Straight from the article)    This might be an ""experience"" to some people, but to me, it's a fancy way to say that they did some walking and dipped their feet in the sea.  Congratulations to them from getting away from real minimalism of watching TV and browsing Reddit all day.  :)"
digitalnomad,39zn1u,witoldc,2,Tue Jun 16 07:44:18 2015 UTC,"Traveling lightly is a very limiting existence? Backpackers just exist? It sounds like you will either have a lot of gear or a bad time. Or you could have a house (expensive) with stuff and travel without your stuff (best of both worlds). But, if you're traveling, do we need to go back to the time of private train cars so we can bring all of our stuff? (Stuff that breaks and requires constant maintenance and storage after purchase.) Some activities definitely require more gear than others (photography and music are two already mentioned obvious examples), but there's a lot that can be done without much stuff at all."

I'd say that about working a shit job just to pay rent/mortgage and the other bare necessities of life. 3) I'll take pretty monuments and beaches over a fancy hotel that I never leave. I could get lost in the bazaars in Mumbai and hiking Monserrate and dancing on the beaches in Cartagena regardless of how little I pack.  Not that I've ever stayed in a hostel or backpacked. But your whole post comes across as bitter and elitist.  I've travelled to lots of countries and lived without many of the things I have at home. It's made me appreciate what I have but at the same time I found I could still be happy and enjoy life extremely without those things...that gear.  Then again, my addictions have never been booze, drugs, nor things."
digitalnomad,39zn1u,frustman,3,Tue Jun 16 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things that don't take that much gear at all. Reading, writing, programming, talking to people, eating, exercise, traveling. If you're really into photography, that could easily double the amount you bring with you traveling. If you're into music, that also takes a lot gear, but there are ways to at least record music without too much gear. But not everybody is that into photography or playing music, and if you're into it, you can try to be semi minimal about it. Jack White uses shitty guitars on purpose because he believes limitations increase his creativity (though I'm sure he has quite a collection...but he could get by without it)."

Do I go to Thailand and southeast Asia or south america? Can't do both at the same time.  Things vs things is another. Posting photography at a close to professional level? Gotta sacrifice space for other things (including cash to acquire the equipment you want - not ""need"" because as most professionals will tell you it's the photographer and not the tools that make the photo).  Complaining that one can't have it all may be accurate but futile. Sacrifice is part of life. Prioritize and commit to your decision.  Some people may be happier with their things. Others may be happier ""existing"" in hostels with cheap booze from corner markets. And yet others may take their work with them and book on airbnb. Different modes for different means, all enjoying themselves."

In reality, most of the best and deepest experiences require commitment and equipment.   To each their own. My best experiences have consisted of zero commitment or equipment. I think of things like talking a bunch of noobie travelers to the Dominican Republic into an authentic restaurant complete with a servicio of Ron Barcelo or three or four. Required no special equipment.   Most of my best experiences have to do with my family and friends. No equipment necessary. So I wholeheartedly disagree with your assertion. I think everyone makes their own decision about what is important or meaningful. Some of my favorite memories might seem completely boring to you. Yet I kiteboard, surf, ski, wakeboard, etc and I still would consider more placid family/friends experience more fulfilling. Which just shows we all make our own decisions on what's important."

Some of my best experiences have been shooting the shit over a couple of packs of cards. Does that count as gear? To me the highest level of experience is connection with others. It sounds like to me your highest level of experience is based on adrenaline. We're just wired differently. It doesn't mean you're right or I'm right. We're just different.   Let me try to explain it a different way because we are wired differently. Why couldn't I say all those ""experiences"" you value with your gear, are basically solitary experiences and not nearly as valuable as experiences that you share with people you are close to? Does that ring true to you? I'm sure you're thinking that's bullshit. That's because we're different, you and I.

digitalnomad,39zn1u,MRomeo99,2,Tue Jun 16 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"When you put it this way, I think you make a good point and perhaps I understand where you are coming from.  ""To me the highest level of experience is connection with others. It sounds like to me your highest level of experience is based on adrenaline.""

Why couldn't I say all those ""experiences"" you value with your gear, are basically solitary experiences and not nearly as valuable as experiences that you share with people you are close to? Does that ring true to you?   Actually, I see gear and activities as the optimal segue to meet people and make lifelong friends.  Niche activities like paragliding have small tight-knit crowds.  I don't buy motorcycles, trailers, and go to race tracks just to ride my bike.  I go because that's where people passionate about riding can be found.  Relationships generally start from common bonds, and the more niche the activity, the stronger the bond...  A lot of activities are also team activities.  That's why people start up ""social leagues"" for various activities...   Of course my goal is not to attack anyone's choices, or push upon anyone what an ""experience"" is and is not.  I simply think that the ""experiences vs things"" argument is totally played out.  It's bullshit.  It's how people rationalize some things they're doing, or try to sound motivational."

It's unfair to them. It's a romantic idea to sell all your stuff and go travel, I've thought about it myself even, but long term or past your teens or twenties, it's unrealistic for anyone who wants to reproduce and carry on having a civilization."

Then just go somewhere for a month and work remotely and show that you can do it and try to be really productive during that time.  The seed is planted and then a while later, maybe several months later, bring it up again and say, ""remember when was gone for a month, I really liked it, I was more productive and I want to do it long term"" you might in that case have more leverage in that you've already shown you can do it.  Of course, the part where you have to lie and make up a story to leave initially is a weak point, it's never good to do that, maybe instead of lying you can engineer something that actually takes you somewhere for a month so it's not a lie?"

Mostly though, you are banking that they don't want to train some new guy and it would be easier for them to just keep you, on your terms.  For me it was like this:  Hi boss. I'm moving to x. I've got some good friends and connections there and need a change of scenery. I have really enjoyed working with you and if you are open to the idea of me working with you remotely, I would be happy to continue our relationship.

Not everyone is wired to be an affiliate. Are you willing to test and experiment with your money? Can you stay positive and on track when you bleed several thousand $ in one campaign? It's not for everyone.  Do you see yourself building and maintaining software for many years? Writing code for or designing websites for SMBs you don't give a shit about? How many programming languages did you look into? Did you go through tutorials? How did you like them? If you choose programming for any other reason than liking a lot of the aspects of it, you'll find yourself in just another place that will often feel like a chore. A place you don't want to be in.   A huge variety of skills and ideas can allow you to live a nomadic life. I heard of architects, personally know authors, medical doctors, electrical engineers and really a lot of different professions in between who found their own ways to make a living on the road. Some are very successful, some are less so but they continue trying and never give up. What all of them have in common is not asking for permission or validation but blazing their own trail."

You have to be able to always crack down on the side of being a little too hard, so that you always have room to lighten up. Also, you won't get walked over. What age group are you going to work with?   I operated an Amazon FBA account but my ex operated a powerseller eBay store. We were tied to one place. That having been said, if you aren't getting into teaching to improve others' lives you might hate it. Asiatic cultures often make good students, and I wish you the best. I'm sorry I'm being negative, but I fear that you are taking this leap for the wrong reasons.  In their culture, they respect teachers because Confucious thought the passing of knowledge was sacred enough to put in their equivalent of the ten commandments.  That having been said, you seem to have a solid plan! KICK ASS! Others TEFL'ers have told me that you should attempt to learn the language as best you can. This will show your respect of the local culture. If they seem to care about your age more than western cultures, its because of a Confucian belief that you must be the same age as your friends. In fact, you might want to study Confucian thinking. Obviously you are courageous enough to think apart from others because you want to DN, but Asiatic cultures are often more communal. Individual thought is a good ole free speech Western ideal. The last thing before I get off my soapbox, is that these communal cultures (Hispanic and Mid-Eastern cultures too) often cheat in school because they don't view school as a competition like the West does.

digitalnomad,39x44i,SearchingTheDark,2,Tue Jun 16 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"If you're going to freelance, you practically have to be full stack. I offload my design work to someone I partner with because I don't have an eye for it, but I do most of the implementation myself.  So I guess the answer is ""both"". I've personally never had to build a mobile app that didn't need some sort of API backing it. Apps without that exist, certainly, but anything moderately complex will need something behind it storing and syncing data as well as providing a standard API for apps + web + analytics."
digitalnomad,39uhx9,yardstickgolf,32,Sun Jun 14 22:00:11 2015 UTC,"Your startup idea is worth shit.  Zero dollars, zero cents.  It's actually less than worthless, because you are going to have to pay somebody to get anywhere with it.  Get comfortable with that reality before you consider going further.  You have no idea how old ""I've got an idea, I just need somebody to code it"" gets.  It's so old it's not even the punchline of a joke anymore- it's too worn out.  The fundamental problem is you're not valuing the technology enough to actually commit to getting enough into it to make it work.  Here is how successful tech startups work:  one person is the business side, the other is the tech side.  50/50.  (Or 33% x3, etc...) You need somebody that is mixing the kool aid right along with you, but also someone you trust enough to go into battle with and with enough of a stake to be able to steer the ship and tell you no.  Anyone who goes into this with you for less is going to be too doe eyed and inexperienced to really make the right decisions and see it through.  Aside from needing an equal partner that you can trust and will go the distance with you, you also need to be shouting what you're doing from the rooftops at anyone who will listen.  Rookie startup mistake #3,421 is being secretive about what you're doing.  My recommendation is to go on Angellist and hired.com, set up a profile and go work somewhere that is post series A for the next couple of years.  Go to the next startup school.  Go to parties in SF and meet people.  Everyone will talk to you about their startup(s), what's working and (mostly) what hasn't.  With your 18 month cushion, don't plan on spending it.  Put it all away or pay off debt, whichever nets you the most interest, with enough to have 3 months of expenses easily accessible, then use that financial security to get out of your comfort zone a bit.  I have never seen or heard of a startup that was bootstrapped the way you're thinking about be successful.  I've seen wealthy guys personally sink a ton of money of their own + friends and family, and another group of doctors that were just literally sinking their salaries into paying some developers.  It never works because there either isn't enough koolaid, passion, experience, or some combination.    Even if you had 7 figures of play money, I wouldn't recommend doing anything on your own without an equal partner.  If you do have that kind of play money, you're far better off coming out to SF and finding someone that will help you put it to work than doing your own without any experience.  Yes, the story you're imagining does happen.  But it's about the same rate as a kid not studying in school because he thinks he's going to play pro sports.   You might as well be playing the lottery as a retirement strategy."
digitalnomad,39uhx9,RoboErectus,8,Mon Jun 15 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"So much yes. Ideas are over rated, execution is everything, any one can have an idea. The other important note is there is a difference between a ""partner"" and someone you call a partner but really you just want them to write code. By the very fact that you are saying the idea is ""100%"" yours means that you are thinking in a very wrong, and quite frankly, stupid way. What if the partner you want to bring on has a better idea but will only develop it with changes?  If you want someone just to write code than hire a developer at market rate, don't try and get a lower rate by offering equity if you don't actually want their input. My 2c."

digitalnomad,39uhx9,ToastPop,5,Mon Jun 15 00:50:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with others that you should change your attitude about starting your product. An idea really isn't all that valuable. There are a million ideas out there, and chances are yours has been done before. What you need is proper execution, and a large part of that is acknowledging the importance of what your technical partner can bring to the table. Your other skills are definitely valuable, especially if you can get a lot of business, because a lot of developers can't do that. But you should treat those skills equally as important as those of your technical partner. He/she isn't just going to listen to you bark commands and code them out, they will also have a lot of valuable insights based on other products they've used, blogs they've read, startups they've followed, etc. So a 50/50 split is more than reasonable if there's just 2 of you going at this.  Actually finding the partner will be trickier. You'll probably want to befriend some people in these communities, or look for references from your existing social circles. I don't think I would trust a partnership with a random found online, especially if you're going to be so coy about what the product actually is, that will make it hard to really get an idea of whether they would be good to partner with or not."

Thank goodness my savings dried up and I was forced to create a real source of income."
digitalnomad,39uhx9,twelvis,2,Mon Jun 15 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat: I know the info and biz, but I need help with the tech.  It's very important that you at least understand the tech and how to work with technical people. Read the ""Dummies"" books on the software you'll need so you can at least speak the same language (zing!) with your programmer.   How would you go about finding a partner you can trust to develop the product and what would you offer knowing that 1) the product is 100% your idea and 2) you are the key to any revenue generation.    Now speaking from very recent experience, finding a partner is not necessarily the way to go. Lemme guess: you like the idea of a partner who knows what you're thinking and just gets stuff done? You'll motivate each other, etc. Unless you already have a friend like that who you've know for several years, you're not going to just ""find a partner"" much like you don't just ""find a spouse.""  You can probably piece together what happened: I decided to partner with an acquaintance. We signed the papers, got a small client, and hit a wall. She ended up being too busy and failed to meet my expectations. But instead of just firing her, I now had to dissolve the partnership, etc. It was just a huge headache that cost us our friendship.    1) the product is 100% your idea and 2) you are the key to any revenue generation.    I was both of those. After we parted ways, she threatened to move ahead with my idea. At first, I was very upset, then I realized, my idea really isn't unique nor is it one coherent idea; it's more the sum of years of experience in a particular field. I was the key to the entire business. I wish her the best of luck, but she's not going to ""steal"" my idea. I don't want to sound like sour grapes, but my partner was a hanger-on, not a leader.  Your ideas are inherently worthless (unless patentable); it's execution that matters.  Now for round 2, I got personal referrals for contractors. One person has been vetted by multiple people and made a good impression on me. I told her my idea, and she's provided critical feedback, and is interested in working for me should I move forward with the project.   Don't try to offload risk onto another person; it's your business, take responsibility. You can either have a business with a low start-up cost and pay someone out of pocket or have high development costs paid for by your first client(s); I'm opting for the latter. I have no need to take her on as a partner; meanwhile, she doesn't want to take the risk of not being paid.   In short, do you really need a partner or do you need a good person to do the job?    I have a pretty good idea for a product and think I can get it into some very large organizations, but will need some help building it. I don't want to give away the farm or go deep in pocket to get it developed.    Then pitch it! If they're interested, create a proposal. It's not unheard of to have customer #1 ""pay"" for development. Most of the largest B2Bs in world work this way. In my case for example, I'll ask for let's say $50k for client #1's custom solution, which factors in let's say $40k to the developer (I'm only concerned about not losing money at this point, because I will have a working solution, so the extra $10k is just safety margin). Also, I'm going to insist on some money upfront to get things going (just normal good biz practice). Now, I can charge client #2 $50k for a similar solution, but I can reuse 75% of the materials and knowledge from client #1; now my costs for client #2 are only ~$10k.   Not only that, but if you've got tons of orders, that's the kind of think you can take to the bank or investors asking for money."

digitalnomad,39rk27,Ginfly,6,Thu Jun 18 04:30:36 2015 UTC,"I started with a wife and we adopted a dog in Guatemala.  The wife is the easy part. Traveling internationally with a dog, it turns out, is a pain and can be somewhat expensive.  A dog that size cannot go into the cabin of a plane unless they're a support animal of some type - physical or emotional. The regulations are easy to abuse here and will get you some pushback, but are only valid on airlines that operate within the US.  Most countries have a list of requirements and a window of X days to complete your paperwork with a vet prior to boarding your plane. Some countries do not allow foreign dogs to come in at all.  Keep in mind the space requirements for your dog to get exercise while in a foreign country. We've found that not having a yard is a large problem for our energetic dog.  If you don't bring the dog on the plane [edit: in the cabin], you'll have to provide a carrier large enough for the dog to stand without touching (among other things) to be placed under the plane. Many US airlines don't allow this during summer months (May - Sept), so you would instead ship the dog as cargo. Our estimate on a cargo option was $350.  In our case, it's working out like this (Guatemala -> US): we will be paying $197 to a local vet's office to handle all of our paperwork for us rather than travel back and forth to the Capital twice within the maximum-10-day-window the US allows.  The same will happen if we return to Guatemala. If the paperwork isn't back in time, we'll have to buy new plane tickets and start the process over.  Fingers crossed."
digitalnomad,39rk27,Ginfly,3,Sun Jun 14 04:00:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like quite the hassle.
digitalnomad,39rk27,MRomeo99,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"It is a bit of a hassle. The agency that handled the adoption dropped the ball with informing us on any of this when we got the dog.  It was going to be even harder until we learned we could just pay the vet to do it all for us.  I recommend looking into it anyway. Some countries are easier than others (many just require up-to-date vaccinations and being chipped with an ISO chip), and it isn't very hard to get the dog onto the plane as an emotional support animal and save quite a bit of hassle and money (though some people would be upset at me for saying so)."
digitalnomad,39rk27,Ginfly,2,Sun Jun 14 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"Just in case no one knew. The whole service dog thing is a joke. I found out from a lady that works with indigents(the homeless) that you can get a service dog certificate off the internet for $40-50. Look it up. There's no testing, no certifications, it's just pay whoever you want online. I told my dad about it, and he uses it in his beach condo that has a 25lb restriction on animals."
digitalnomad,39rk27,MRomeo99,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"Specifically, that's for emotional support animals. And, yes, it is a very simple system to abuse, unlike actual service animals who are trained to do specific tasks for people with physical needs, and which are certified."
digitalnomad,39rk27,Ginfly,2,Tue Jun 16 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"No it's actually not. I thought the same as you do. There has to be some sort of ruling body, or rules or something saying this dog has been trained to be a service dog, and passed some sort of test or something. Sadly there is not.   Do a google search. You can buy a service dog license/registration/certification from dozens of organizations/individuals. And yes the industry is riddled with abusers. Try riding in a bus in most large cities, and you'll find plenty of homeless people with their ""service dogs"". A client told me about it.   There is no ruling body, nobody who will arrest you or your dog if you didn't go through their training. It's rampant with abuse. But the fact of the matter is by US laws there is no overseeing body over service dogs in any way.   Directly quoted from one of the sites: We expect and hope that you will use this registry as intended and in a responsible and respectful manner. Registration is conducted under the honor system and we are not required to verify any disability or review any documentation to verify any disability, any individual found to abuse this registry will be expelled from the registry.  The registry is not intended to be a certification process and we do not judge the proficiency of our registrants in any way, and nor would that be necessary under the law. Of course, we recognize that under the law you are allowed to train your own animal and we can not be responsible or liable for the actions of dog owners or their dogs either online or offline."
digitalnomad,39rk27,inspireNomad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"I did not know that.  However, based on what I've read, an airline can make you demonstrate the service your dog can perform, but cannot exclude an emotional support animal for any reason other than illness or aggressiveness."

digitalnomad,39rk27,purplegoodance,2,Sun Jun 14 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"From memory Tieland to Thailand travel with their cat. http://tielandtothailand.com/ Not quite the same as a large dog but it is a pet.  The dog could be an interesting problem. I guess you are already looking into the mechanics of flying with a dog. You may also want to do some research into how people respond to dogs in various places. Do they commonly keep dogs? What kinds of dogs?  For example in Thailand you see large-ish dogs roaming the streets most days so they aren't an issue. If people can deal with roaming packs of street dogs your pet dog should be no problem for people. Although your dog and the street dogs might have some problems.  In Barcelona owning large dogs, even in small apartments, is super common and there are parks all over the place that are frequently full of dogs of all sizes running around.  Meanwhile in Singapore we looked after a decent sized dog and some Singaporeans were terrified of it. I would qualify most as ""wary"" but a few crossed over into outright frightened even though it was an especially goofy weimaraner that was ultra non-threatening, in my eyes anyway. Lap dogs are common but actual big ""real dogs"" are very much not. On several occasions people, mostly older people, literally screamed and ran away from a very friendly dog that was sitting quietly licking its bits. One guy ran his bicycle into a fence in fright. A group of grown adults had a big ""you touch it. no you touch it."" session before one person literally sprinted over to the dog that was lying down trying to ignore them, to poke it with one finger before running away. It made taking the dog out for exercise a bit of a chore.  Also a dog anywhere with a large muslim population is likely to be an issue. I am no expert but I gather that dogs are seen as inherently unclean in some way. That just means that muslims are unlikely to grow up around dogs and having little experience with them, well, it is a large animal with lots of pointy teeth if you look at it objectively. We just don't see them like that because we have built up positive associations with dogs.   The only life complication is I have a wife   Do make sure that she has something to do. Maybe she can go out and do stuff without you while you work, maybe she has projects of her own, a language course, reading books, some sort of hobby. You just don't want her kicking around while you are trying to work bored out of her mind, asking you ""whatcha doin'?"" for the millionth time :D If one of you is bored both of you will be unhappy."

The mansion is coming to a close but will likely be reopening in 2-3 months. I am moving to DF next week and I am unbelievably excited.   Have you been to Mexico City? It's one of the greatest cities in the world. The food, the culture, the history, its very hard not to fall in love with this city. Food ranges wildly in price from 10 peso street tacos (delicious) to extremely expensive restaurants in some of the more 'upscale areas'.  In regards to safety, I've never once felt even remotely unsafe and I've done a lot of partying and walking home drunk as a gringo. Uber is extremely active here so you never have to take a cab, the cabs here are notorious for ripping foreigners off.  If you like to party it's amazing for that as well. The clubs/bars don't really close and are hapenning basically every night of the week.  If you want to chill out there are more museums than you can believe. Chapultepec park is massive and absolutely gorgeous. Great for chilling out any day of the week.  The weather is hit or miss, it can be quite rainy but that's about it. Sometimes it get's chilly but nothing too crazy. Most of the time the weather is great.  Anyways, I love Mexico City and I know you will too. I will be living there for two months starting next week.

Yes you need a VPN, yes there will be times you want to bang your head on the table, but it's manageable and the majority of the time I can get stuff done, no worries.   Also note when there are big news court cases (Zhou Yongkang - this past few days) or events happening, vpn crackdowns go into overdrive. A few tips to make life easier:   Don't use the popular vpn's that all expats use. Setup a remote desktop/vps server and connect to it via RDP, no need for a vpn. Try to use local services such as Weixin (wechat) if you can. I like to use appear.in for video conferencing. Skype works for me, but can lag sometimes. China mobile as an ISP gives me less vpn headaches compared to other ISP's (imo 2cents)"
digitalnomad,39ohtw,sanyatark,5,Sat Jun 13 13:05:38 2015 UTC,Why not setup a private vpn on a vps? Or are they somehow detecteing vpn traffic?

digitalnomad,39ohtw,djmc,13,Sat Jun 13 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"I can answer this as I have been in china the last 3 years and running my own VPN for all of them. Any OpenVPN connection, regardless of port and host, is detected within seconds of its first connection via advanced heuristics and deep packet inspection. You can get around this by modifying the OpenVPN binary to do a simple stream cipher on the output stream with a custom key you set so all they see is random junk.  In response to that, they flag connections that are long lived and that they can't read and then throttle them as well, just to be safe.  SSH is generally free from issues, but when things tighten up around big news events, it can get much less reliable.  I find one of the most reliable VPNs for both speed and stability is PPTP based connections, my guess is because they can read those so there is perhaps a honey pot aspect to it."

digitalnomad,39ohtw,kanev91,5,Sun Jun 14 05:41:01 2015 UTC,"There are a few reasons that tunneling over SSH works when VPN doesn't, but primarily it comes down to this: the GFW can't shape SSH traffic without affecting China's IT industry. Not having access to GitHub is bad, but manageable. Not being able to SSH into overseas boxes would be disastrous.  Tunneling over SSH is pretty simple — get a box on which you have an account, connect with -D to make SSH set up a SOCKS proxy, and then configure your browser or OS proxy settings to point to the local proxy.

I am sure setting up your own vpn should work fine. Not sure how suspicious it would make the Chinese but if you have it listen on port 53 it can also allow you to bypass some hotspots that you need to pay for.

I'm sitting in a Starbucks now, just had a Skype call with a client, no serious issues, and watched some YouTube videos. Sometimes the internet goes out and sometimes it is slow, but overall not terrible. After hosting some friends and traveling with them throughout the country, it became obvious to me that is a country that is difficult to get anything done without language skills. Sure, you can get by, but you need language skills to improve your basic quality of living. Overall, if you need good internet, stick to AirBnB, get a 4G sim card for your phone while your here and just realize that you'll have to adjust while living here."

Starbucks & Costa & all that were useless places to me because I didn't bother with a Unicom or whatever cell phone provider, which is Chinese law that you need them in order to access public Internet, and as you know they force you to authenticate via your cell service in order to access their wifi. Had to use boutique cafes only who didn't follow that law.  Yes I could stream Youtube, but on the lowest quality. No chance streaming anything much better. This was 6 weeks of looking for better Internet solutions around the city, so I know I my experience wasn't just a fluke, Internet wise. Maybe Shanghai is just like that."

In other words, the usual.  I wanted to say that staying at places on AirBNB or hotels throughout China won't ensure a reliable Internet connection. That's based on 6+ weeks bouncing around China at various AirBNBs and hotels, all in big cities. No matter how ""nice"" the place or what big city you're in, the likelihood of issues is fairly high to be realistic. So a fair word of warning, if your work is dependent on the Internet, you may run into issues over and over again, day in and out. Of course as others say, maybe you won't at all. But it's a risk that shouldn't be glazed over - I've been using Astrill and a conglomerate of other VPNs. This hasn't consistently helped but makes it work for a short period of time, sometimes even just 15-20 minutes, then it goes kaput. Arg.  And yep, I'm also having a China day."

I was in Shanghai, and I used Astrill. Never got anything more than 1 mbsp anywhere, but it was still good enough at all the cafes I would regularly work at or AirBnBs. Thinking about it, yes Internet at hotels definitely sucked, and you have to avoid any chain cafes because apparently there is a law that any publicly accessible Internet requires you to first authenticate with your Chinese mobile service provider (EDIT  - but every boutique or ex-pat owned cafe ignores this)."

I tried using a VPN for a while, but it really doesn't work. I've noticed that the big problems arise when you are trying to access servers outside of China. The Chinese gov't likes to keep its citizens behind the great firewall, for reasons we all know.   So here's what I did--switched all my services to ones hosted in China. Use Wixin (WeChat) for calls to US, QQ for social media, 163 for email (though Outlook works pretty well too). Microsoft products are also widely used in China, so switching to that for your phone helps a lot. Just do things as the Chinese would do it and you'll be golden.  I know it's frustrating on a day to day basis, but this is really my favorite country in the world. I love traveling/living in China. There is an excitement here like nowhere else.

I also set up Open VPN servers on each of them.  I would use of them until the IP got blocked then switch to the other IP address on the server. And I'd go shopping for a replacement VPS.

Whistleblowers, political dissidents, or normal folks who want unfettered access - situations where Tor is used for ethical purposes - are still criminals. They are breaking the law. And lots of exit nodes steal data, completely true.  Most of the traffic on Tor is script kiddies trying to hack into stuff. Or people trying to get out from under the GFoC or other nation-state internet censorship.  You have no control over what your exit node is, there are known to be rouge exit nodes that steal data, and so security-aware people have to assume that if they use Tor, their traffic is being captured at the exit node. Simple logic.  You're the one making the assumption that criminals are unethical."

Also, you do have control over which exit node to choose, from limiting by country to actually selecting a single specific one. It will make you stand out however.  Anyway, ever heard of https? I use Tor every day for 7+ years and I can count in one hand the times an exit node attempted a MITM.  If you're logging in to non-encrypted stuff over Tor, then you're just silly.  And no, check my post. Where did I say criminals == unethical? All I said is according to OP, anonymous == criminal, and that isn't true.  How criminal of me,I'm loading my rss feed through tor right now! The outrage!"

A travel day should probably be written off as ""nothing of importance will be accomplished"", for example. Leave full days off for seeing sights, an full days for working. The half and half approach is very stressful, and causes huge context switching overhead.   Most importantly, be very diligent about your scheduling and protecting your time.   I put some of my strategy into an article if you're interested: Scheduling for Maximum Productivity  Good luck, and have a blast!"

You want as much of your problems and to-do's out of your brain so you're not stressed and can be present while traveling, and get right back into a groove when you're working."
digitalnomad,39pa52,GottaGetOuttaHere,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"That's actually a great tip--did you coordinate those non-working days with your clients? How did taking travel days off affect your delivery times? For example, normally I can get an article to my clients in 4 days, do you think it's possible/realistic to work extra hard 3 days, finish the article, and take the 4th day off?  I'll take a look at your article for sure, thanks for the link!"
digitalnomad,39pa52,jlengstorf,3,Mon Jun 15 09:28:21 2015 UTC,"Not knowing anything of your working habits, it's really hard to say. If they're anything like mine ca. 2013, then yes — you can probably get them done in two days and take a long weekend.   I solved the client issues by being extremely transparent: email autoresponder letting people know I was only checking emails Tuesday and Thursday each week; estimating long to allow for my time off; making sure I contacted clients well in advance of a deadline if I hit a snag that might affect delivery.   Blocking off days of the week to become email-free may be extreme, but I think anyone can limit to two email checks per day — it's not easy, but no client worth keeping will ever complain about a six-hour turn on email.   Regarding delivery times, I schedule against a two-day weekend, and usually plan to only be busy for four days. That gives me a day to handle overflow (or an extra day to explore) and no one is rushed because I only planned four days of work.   The context-batching stuff was a game-changer for me. Since then I haven't worked more than 50 hours (total screen time: work, Netflix, social media, etc.) in any given week, and it's often closer to 30 hours — with no drop in my output.   Most of my hours before were spent fucking around or trying to get into a groove; once I figured out how I worked best and got dictatorial about how I'd spend time, it was like I'd just discovered I had the World's Most Boring Superpower and was twice as productive, at least. :)"
digitalnomad,39pa52,proxwell,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"Your first two questions are really about communication and setting expectations with your clients.  Personally, I schedule delivery dates and check-ins explicitly and set the expectation with clients that I am not on-call at all hours.  If they ring me and I'm able to jump on with them quickly, great.  Of course, I usually try to accommodate them in that.  (I work extra hard to offset the image that some clients have that I'm relaxing on the beach somewhere, drinking beer at 10am.)  The answer to your third question really depends on what your goals are.  Personally, when I find a way to do things faster my first thought is usually that I can capture that extra efficiency as increased income.  That's an advantage that folks in employee arrangements don't have.  In that situation, they hope that some fractional return on the gains they've created come back to them come bonus time, or in the form of a promotion/raise.  On the other hand, some people's first thought with efficiency gains is that they now have more free time.  An ex-girlfriend of mine is a photographer and photo-editor.  I helped her with her lead-generation and positioning so that she effectively multiplied her hourly rate by ~5X.  Her first thought was that she could now work only one day a week.  Neither approach is right or wrong.  It really depends on what you value the most.  The beautiful thing about having your own business is that you get to make those choices, and decide what ""success"" looks like."
digitalnomad,39pa52,proxwell,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"Totally agree about protecting your work time.  Totally disagree that travel days should be written off.  Why write off the day when you can work on the plane/train, and get wifi at most airports and cafes?  Personally, I try to squeeze as much productivity as I can out of my travel days.  I think they lend themselves to certain types of creative work.  I do some of my best writing and coding on trains.  I find the motion of the passing landscape to be supportive of those kinds of work.  Flights can also be nice in that, without wifi, I'm not interrupted by client emails and calls, and I can get things done without those (more-frequent and unplanned) context-switches.  Having mixed work/rec days is a personal perference.  I don't think there's a very big penalty to switching between a few large blocks of work and non-work.  Personally, I like to do a couple large blocks of each.  How I structure them depends on which TZ I'm in.  If you run a service-based business, you probably want this decision to be guided by the TZ's your clients are in.  Usually, in the Americas, I like do start with a block of work in the morning to mid-afternoon, then have some non-work time between until the early evening, followed by another work block from then to midnight.  When I'm in Europe, I tend to do fun stuff in the first part of the day, while my (mostly american) clients are not in the office and then start my workday in the early afternoon, up to about 2am.  In Asia, I tend to cluster my work in the early morning and late evening, and do non-work stuff in the mid-day.    There is some advantage to be had in doing errands and recreation while everyone else is at work.  Great to not wait in long lines at businesses.  When I'm roosted near the mountains, nature, beach, etc. I find there to be something very delicious about having a surf/ski session or going hiking on a weekday.  In part because of the lower crowds relative to the weekend, and in part because I feel like I'm actualy taking advantage of the fact that I set my own schedule."
digitalnomad,39pa52,jlengstorf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:07:49 2015 UTC,"I think everyone has a balance that works best for them. I definitely have days where I get a lot of work done while traveling, but I never factor those days into estimates.   To my clients and projects, travel days are a loss; too many variables that could cost me the day, and too much stress if I have to get something done while also traveling."
digitalnomad,39pa52,PFULMTL,4,Fri Jun 19 14:59:34 2015 UTC,"Get out of bed. Don't waste time in the morning  A good thirty minutes to an hour can be wasted if you stare at the ceiling or if you mess with your mobile.  Do your morning duties, then eat breakfast while looking at your emails, or daily pages, as you would a newspaper.  Other times, I like to get ready to head out for breakfast and use the bike ride or walk as my exercise for the day.  Sometimes not even looking at my mobile/laptop until after I get back.  The fresh air or a bit of exercise can get you more motivated."

I'd even assume that you'll only really work a half day the next day if it was a long drive.   I pretty much would get up, eat, shower and then find a coffee shop to camp out in for the day to get my work done.  On work days the only thing I'd really get to do was after work, go out to a local restaurant and walk around for a bit.  Scheduling calls is the hardest part, I generally couldn't take calls in coffee shops so I'd schedule them all in a single block one to two days a week and do those at the beginning or end of the day when I could be in the place I was staying.   If I could get my work done early, then I'd just have a bonus time to explore.  I took 2-3 days a week to travel around as vacation time.  It's also important to note when you're out near the national forests, the coast, or some other outdoors locations there is no cell reception or very spotty with no LTE."

digitalnomad,39kg0j,AlbertPinny,7,Fri Jun 12 10:19:09 2015 UTC,"I have used a public library in Australia quite a few years ago. I was just using their computers for a big email binge so not sure if that really counts. I can't personally say whether they provide wifi but I would be kind of surprised if they didn't.   why don't all users of coworking spaces take over the libraries?   You have to be quiet, sometimes they have time limits, otherwise, yeah, not sure why.   What about University libraries also, are they generally open to the public, or restricted to students?   It varies. Frequently they do have turnstiles that require a student card to enter into either a small section or basically the whole library. With any luck they would at least have a study area that is in the public area. Not sure how you would go with wifi without being a student but you might get lucky.   I need a somewhat peaceful location, coffee shops are too distracting for me :(   If you aren't using them already headphones are a great help. Over the ear ones are usually best as they also muffle sounds from around you but anything that lets you put music on is good. Also, you may be able to pick a spot or rearrange some furniture so that you are facing a wall or similar. Once you have music on and little movement in your field of vision you might have an easier time."

The libraries I've worked at are free, open to the public, free of distraction, full of outlets, have comfortable seating, and some even have cafes. The wifi isn't always great, so you might want a generous data plan for tethering just in case.  I don't understand why nomads are so eager to set up camp in coffee shops or pay by the hour for co-working spaces. There's nothing glamorous about this to me, it's a huge pain finding outlets, making sure you have reliable wifi, feeling like you've been hogging a cafe seat far too long for the one coffee you bought 2 hours ago, etc. It's almost as if you're paying money to be more distracted and get less work done. If I want to meet people and see what they're working on at a co-working space, sure, but I think the reality is offices and desks are actually ideal for getting work done, and that's a huge struggle with working on the road."

Because we don't have any workspace in our Airbnb apartment, we steal the local internet connexion from the library computer... The internet is much faster and it's 24/7!  We haven't had any problems even though we come every day. As long as you're not disturbing anybody or want to check out a book, you shouldn't have any problems.  We've also been working at the university in Quebec when we were staying there. The only thing is you might have problems connecting to the internet if it's for student only, but most of them have it publicly available.  I'd say give it a try!

You do not have to join the library, though if you want to use any special service you will have to (This could change depending on council).

digitalnomad,39kg0j,ArrowToTheNi,4,Sat Jun 13 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"It does take a little adjusting, but I have my toilet & shower, and a full kitchen, really all the comforts of home, including my swivel rocker/recliner.  Words can't really describe how beautiful it is to wake up with a lake, a beach, or a forest at your doorstep.  I only park in free spots, so my only overhead is really my gas costs, because I'd be paying for my food, insurance, etc. no matter where I was living, but I don't have to pay a mortgage, rent, or utility bills anymore which saves me upwards of $2k per month right there.  All the stress and money worries just melt away.  I started my own business, so I'm the boss and can work my own hours and only have to answer to myself.  I rarely put in more than a couple of hours a month now for my $60k a year income.  I out source all of the actual work, and all I need to do is check to make sure everything keeps running smoothly.  We are brainwashed into being good little slaves, working for others, making them rich while we struggle to pay the bills, buy a house, etc.  The truth is that for most of us, if we're ever going to really get ahead, we need to break those chains and start our own businesses.  I not saying anybody should up and quit a job they have now, but it's never to late to start your own business on the side, in your spare time, and build it up until it's making more than your current job pays you.  If you're making your money online, you can do it from almost anywhere and set your own hours, and actually enjoy your life.  You can do it from your own home or apartment, or anywhere you have an internet connection.  I got started in my own business for a measly $200 investment which gave me all the directions and tools I needed to succeed.  Someone else doing the same thing turned me on to it.  I couldn't believe it when I made all of my money back 2 days later, and it's been making me money ever since.  I had to put in about 10 hours a week to start with to make it work, but sure enough it worked, and turned into a full time income working very spare time hours.  We just have to realize that the American Dream that we were taught was all a lie.  We just have to think outside the box to build our own future, where we can't be downsized or the company shut down completely. Owning our own businesses is the only way to secure our future."

digitalnomad,39kg0j,suzhouCN,2,Sun Jun 14 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"Mine isn't really a typical RV, but more of a home made camper van.  It was originally a Holiday Inn shuttle van, with a high enough top to be able to stand up in.  I simply removed the rear seats and moved my furniture in.  I have a metal framed futon sofa/bed, in the back passenger side corner, running lengthwise towards the side doors.  Under the bed are my generator, my house battery, and other storage.  Just to the front of the futon I keep 2 x 7 gallon water jugs.  Then there is empty space to get in/out of the side door, and behind the passenger seat are my 2 x 7 gallon kerosene jugs, and a 5 gallon metal jerry can for gas.  Behind the drivers seat is my kitchen, made from plastic drawer sets with a wooden shelf on top.  This provides both my kitchen counter top, and also an open workbench for any projects I might be working on.  If I'm cooking indoors, I put my camp stove on top, plus I have two rectangular plastic dish pans that I use for sinks.  I use trigger spray bottles for the water to my sinks, very handy.  To the back of my kitchen is my bathroom.  It consists of a shower curtain using a hula hoop for the curtain rod, and a handicap style bucket toilet.  I use a rubbermaid storage tote for shower base, to catch the water, and a marine style foot powered water pump for water delivery.  Behind my bathroom running to the back doors along the wall are more plastic drawer sets, also with wood shelves on top.  These give me a lot of storage.  In thee center aisle way, starting at the back doors, is my ice chest, stacked on top of my A/C unit, which also doubles as a night stand beside my bed.  A couple feet in front of that is my kerosene heater, and then in line with the side doors is my euro style swivel rocker recliner.  I use TV trays for my tables.  It's not nearly as fancy looking as the factory built ones, but every one of those that I was ever in just felt really cramped to me, and there wasn't really a comfortable seat in the house, not one you'd be willing to spend all day in if the weather was bad.  I think having a comfortable place to sit was my #1 reason to build my own.  With just me, it's actually pretty spacious at 6 foot wide by 12 feet long and 6+ foot in height, and that's the dimension of my house portion from behind the front seats.  I had other RV's first, but none of them were as comfortable and convenient as this camper van is.  When I'm in a town, I can park in a normal parking spot with this one, something I couldn't do with any of the others.  The larger RV's were also much harder to heat or cool."

My university's library, for example, has a limited amount of computers for users that don't have a card (non-student cards include those for alumni, spouses of faculty, staff, and members of affiliate organizations such as archival groups). As a guest you have to sign in, get a code, and then you have--I believe--an hour before it logs you off automatically and your work is not saved. So, very inconvenient. Though I've seen others with open public WiFi, and ones in-between so it can vary.  That said, if you have an affiliation with a university look into something called eduroam.

You can't go to lunch and find out, informally, what you could be doing better. You may be confident you are doing a great job, and be completely wrong.  And here's the part you won't like: you won't be trusted to work remotely. Oh, you finished school? That's nice. That doesn't show you know anything about the discipline required for the day-in, day-out drudgery (yes, sometimes it's fun, but it's still work). You'll be expected to handle the basics before you are trusted with something more advanced."

The owner handed me my resignation letter and said to keep it, we'll get me on a remote working agreement.

They are a group of young people, like myself, trying to start a technology company, and they need a mechanical design engineer to design a prototype for their Kickstarter campaign. I accepted the gig recently but have not talk about any compensation yet. According to their ad, the compensation is pretty decent but not enough to replace a full-time job.  A friend of mine got an 80k remote job not long after college as a developer for a porn site based in San Francisco, but he has to occasionally travel to the main office. Note that this guy is a rock star developer. It sounds like a pretty good deal to me, but he quit and joined a local start-up. I don't know why he quit.  So there are definitely opportunities for recent college grads to work remotely. You're right about the experience required. Many jobs I encountered requite some experience, but some do mentioned that they'll accept recent college grad with no experience if you are truly exceptional. Your best bet is software developing jobs at a start up."

It is at least something on my resume / linkedin as work experience though. From now until I graduate I will work on beefing up my Android portfolio to the point where I am WANTED. If I am wanted, then my chances of getting a remote position would increase greatly.  The 9-5 M-F life is not for me. Working 40 hrs a week isn't the worst thing ever, but commuting and waking up early and having to live in a set schedule is the worst thing ever. I plan on only applying to remote positions when I graduate, or make it clear that I want a remote position.

digitalnomad,39cz67,bertweaze,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:21:07 2015 UTC,My advice is that you shouldn't try to work remotely right out of college. You'd be undermining your long-term career by missing out on the knowledge and wisdom that you get by working in close proximity to people who are a lot better at doing what you hope to do (because they have experience). Only after you spend some time doing this should you then look to work remotely.  tl;dr: Remote work emphasizes personal freedom to grow. Traditional offices emphasize learning from those who have more experience in your field.

I was feeling a little scared not being able to move and being I was so far from help.   I lived off the mini bar for a while. Then I staggered down to the hotel reception and - I kid you not - this is how it went down:   Reception called me a taxi, and told him which doctor to take me to.  Taxi driver took me up to the sixth floor of the place until he found the doctor's reception, almost wouldn't accept my fare.  Doctor gave me injections, advice, wouldn't charge me ANYTHING, and walked me to the pharmacy, talking to the pharmacist for me.  The pharmacist gave me heavily discounted drugs, and called a taxi back to my hotel.    I was safely back in my hotel, and nothing worth claiming for. Honestly, I was treated better in a foreign country than at home!  I don't doubt it could be as bad as that was good, but it's funny being sick and away... you never know."

digitalnomad,39c4u1,yggdrasiliv,2,Thu Jun 11 12:11:36 2015 UTC,Your travel insurance should cover the cost of travel back to your home country in the case of medical emergency.

digitalnomad,39c4u1,yggdrasiliv,3,Thu Jun 11 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"First off, have travel insurance no matter where you go, no exceptions.  Have enough cash in reserve that if you're incapacitated in a place where you don't know anyone, you can hire someone online (craigslist, upwork, etc.) to help you with whatever you need (food deliveries, errands, etc.)  It's good to have thought through where you'd find these people in advance.  Even better if you already have a local VA.  If you're staying in a hotel, they might be able to help you find someone.  Carry enough cash on your person to cover such things.  Sending a stranger to an ATM with your card is less-than-ideal.  Having family who has your back and would literally turn up anywhere in the world to help you in a pinch is priceless.  I have a few people in my life, who, if I were in a jam, would be on the next flight, and I for them.  If you don't have these kinds of friends, focus on being this kind of friend, and soon enough you'll have people who are there for you in this way."

I have travel insurance that I pay for a year at a time, and it covers my medical expenses. At the time when I was most sick I was Manila, and went to a private hospital there many times, raking up a fair few bills with their ER and some specialists. The travel insurance company paid the bills without fuss.   As to getting food and some such, I tend to stay in hotels and serviced apartments. So I lived on room service most days, during that time. There's also food delivery services pretty much everywhere.  I probably spent two weeks seriously ill, and another couple of weeks recovering back to normal form. Though I was able to stay working for most of the time, only taking occasional days off."
digitalnomad,39c4u1,sobri909,2,Thu Jun 11 16:49:13 2015 UTC,It depends on the country where you are.  Its a a place with expensive hospitals (like USA) you need insurance.

digitalnomad,39c4u1,bananabastard,10,Thu Jun 11 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"At a price though, going without insurance is reckless imho. A while ago, I spent 4 days in a hospital in Bangkok with an IV for serious food poisoning. All it took was eating bad sushi and all they did to me was keeping me in a room, put an IV in my arm and run 1 test. It cost around 4 or 5,000$. I was travelling, had insurance and they paid it all.  Healthcare is insanely expensive and not having insurance is asking for trouble.  I'm not even talking about something stupid like a bike accident, a car crash or you being run over by a car where the guilty party flees the scene. You'll have to pay for your own hospital (until the person who injured you is found, if ever) and this will run you into tens if not hundreds of thousands. On the other han, if you have insurance then they'll pay and deal with finding the person responsible.  Lest you need care that cannot be provided in the country you are currently in. You'd need a medical airlift. According to this website, costs range from five to six digits with a minimum of 10k. For the airlift alone.  So yeah, having health insurance should be very high on the list for anyone considering being a nomad. You don't want to be in an emergency and have to deal with costs on top of everything else."

I've traveled to most countries in Asia and none of them would be as audacious to charge what you claim to have been charged. Either you were screwed or you are not telling the whole truth.  In my experience, it would take several major incidents, loss of all your electronics or revolution in the country you're visiting for travel insurance to be worth it. It costs $5 to see a doctor where I am now in China, $2 for a round of anti-biotics. That's a lot of doctor's visits to make a $700 premium worth it."

digitalnomad,395mxe,leenomadic,7,Tue Jun 9 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd like to add from what I've learnt while travelling. Never share your Skype or your ID of any chat app to your clients, don't think it's convenient, it will only make you busy for nothing. For me, now, I only let my clients contact me via email and I reply them when I'm able to do that. When sending me an email they normally don't expect an instant reply, however if I do they'll appreciate, but when they see me online on Skype and send me a message they will sit there and wait for a response and then start an endless conversation."
digitalnomad,395mxe,leenomadic,5,Tue Jun 9 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. There is nothing that is a bigger time waster than endless Skype calls (which can also be challenging technically and time-wise depending on where you are in the world) and usually it's stuff that could be communicated more efficiently via email. Some clients are really into the ""process"" side of things, want to sync up every day to check progress, and those are the ones I avoid."
digitalnomad,395mxe,yuekit,2,Tue Jun 9 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"The majority of my work comes from my contacts before I turned perma-traveller, but I do look for Upwork contracts every now and again.  The key for the Upwork stuff is to be SUPER choosy about what jobs you apply for.  It's up to YOU to find good jobs, it's not up to the clients to find you.    I was very upfront with clients - I told them I don't do fixed-time fixed-price work, but I'd be happy to do a small project for them (<10 hours) for a fixed price, just to show them that I was the real deal.  =) good luck!"

It's worth the effort though."

I couldn't do an English skills test.  I guess people who don't have blogs in the first place are expected to create one.

digitalnomad,395mxe,digitalnomad23,2,Wed Jun 24 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"I've moved on to working on other programming stuff now but I did a bunch of python/django work remotely.   Personally, I didn't like working for end-users, as I found them too demanding for not enough $$ (your mileage may vary, this is just my experience) so I work as a sub-contractor to web dev firms, or other developers who are on-site. For me this works better, as other technical people often have a better grasp of what programming entails.   I found that the work is better and the $$ is better to develop in-person and long-term relationships with clients and work with those clients remotely than to take on odesk work, where you're competing against coders who will work for 10$/hour.   Difficulties for me were figuring out how to manage the work at first, and realizing that having regular meetings/check-ins wasn't compatible with beautiful islands with terrible internet, having to find hotels/apartments with fast enough internet, managing time-zones (lots of meetings at midnight).   You can easily make 3000$/m if you get some regular clients, especially if you find people who have long-term projects and ask them for a retainer once you're proven yourself for a certain number of hours."
digitalnomad,395mxe,SearchingTheDark,5,Thu Jun 11 21:52:33 2015 UTC,"ODesk is probably a waste of time.   All of my clients come from contacts I made back in my less nomadic days. Word of mouth can be a huge boost.   $3,000/month is definitely doable. I think the ""PHP"" part could be a double edged sword. There's a lot of PHP work out there, but lots of low end PHP/JS guys out there too, a lot of competition. It's going to take a little effort to distinguish yourself.  No matter what though, clients DO suck when you're traveling. Even the good ones. I'm trying to transition toward building/selling SaaS products myself to avoid the hassle."
digitalnomad,395mxe,Aziz_92,2,Tue Jun 9 15:31:33 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. 90% of my clients are from elance. My hourly rate ranges from 60$ to 120$/hr depending on the length of contract. (contrary to the popular belief that on elance / odesk you can only make 5-10$/hr)  Sure, most of the listings there are crap, clients looking for people in India/China who are willing to work for 5$/hr, but once you weed through that, you'll find tons of great clients willing to pay top $ for good work."

I've been thinking about doing the same thing -- I think it would be a lot less stressful to have 1 or 2 SaaS products that I maintain instead of client work and always rushing for crazy deadlines, etc.  I don't know how viable it is tho.  Seems like everything you can think of is already a SaaS product somewhere.  But maybe there's room to take something that already exists and make it better somehow?"
digitalnomad,395mxe,SearchingTheDark,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:00:50 2015 UTC,"Depending on the product, you don't need 100% of the market, sometimes a small percentage will do. What I try to do is target areas where there's a lot of competition, but the market is big enough to where I don't need a lot of it to cover just me.  I've had some minor success, but I'm still a long way from replacing my entire income with recurring product income, for now it's mostly 2 big clients who keep me going."

I work remotely for a software company in my home country (Australia). Probably not quite the answer you were hoping for. Remote work has the advantage of stability.  I have however met others who do ok freelancing. Among that crowd however there does seem to be a lot of motivation to start their own thing. If nothing else freelancing income tends to be lumpy so you will do well to have a few things going on ie one or two freelance projects, some affiliate site you have built and some web start up idea you are working on."

It is definitely doable, but remote jobs are always much, much more competitive and as such you need a lot of experience (I have 4 years) and very good interviewing skills to land one.  As for freelance sites, it is possible to make some money off them, it's also possible to find long-term customers from there who could give you referrals to other customers, but it is a long road ahead and it may take a while before you get 3k+ per month from it. See it as a way to find customers, not as a way to make quick money, and it's a tool that can help in the long run."
digitalnomad,395mxe,yuekit,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"This is really no different from the question of how you find customers for any other kind of online business. There are many ways to advertise yourself, of which the freelance sites you mentioned are only the most obvious.   You can use social networking sites, run ads for your business, employ marketing people or affiliates to find work for you, approach clients you want to work for directly. Keep in mind that for a one-person dev shop all you really need are a handful of clients sending you work on a regular basis. Your ideal situation might be to partner with a few marketing agencies and serve as their go-to developer."

I started working freelance half a year before becoming a digital nomad which was helpful for transitioning.  I actually don't get work from odesk and sites like that, but have more direct contacts in the industrie. /r/Jobs4Bitcoins has also lead to surprising good results for me.  Obviously having a simple site with service, portfolio and resume is good, but in reality everyone only asks for my github profile.  Generally it seem that I end up doing a small project for a client and if its done well and we work well together, they mostly become a long term client.  $3000/month is no problem at all if you do good work. When I started out with a small portfolio, I began low (maybe to low) at $25/hour and have been slowly increasing it to hopefully be $50/hour soon.  Beware of shitty hotel internet that may crap out or be very slow randomly, so make sure not to have to many meetings and always have enough work you can do offline if need be."

My advice is to get clients before you go remote, get them used to working with you via email and Skype, then return to ""home base"" once or twice a year for face-to-face refresh meetups.  If you're in London you have access to a huge network of potential clients. Use that network as a springboard for your new lifestyle.  And yes, as other mentioned -- avoid ODesk and similar sites.

A former coworker became CTO at a startup, brought me along, and because said coworker himself likes to be a DN from time to time, it wasn't hard to work something out.  It's definitely not easy when you first start out. I almost got fired, twice.  You land in new country, want to explore the city, meet lots of people, go out a lot more than normal... try balancing all that working 30 hours a week w/o any noticeable drop in quality of your code.

I no longer have to live in the huge city I lived in with high rent and commute and eat out all the time.   I calculated my ""real hourly wage"" and realized if i left my job and went back to freelancing in a smaller city, I wouldn't  be making that much less.

To answer this question it would probably be useful to know what field you're in.

Sometimes courage is understanding that just because you can do something doesn't necessarily mean you should do something. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking charge of your life and deciding your fate...  But that doesn't mean you have to quit working, either. There are a zillion Red Cross charities, to be sure, but that doesn't mean you can't help people. There are always people out there that need help, and if you can spend the next ten years of your life helping others and building something that's going to leave the world just a little better than you found it, it's definitely something worth doing.   It sounds like you want to do something but you're talking yourself out of it at the same time. There's always a reason to say no, but you have to find the reason to say yes that works for you.

Also, if you have several advanced degrees, why not do part time as a professor. You could look for a way to study into your great idea for a company you can start.  Granted, I have no idea if colleges actually hire people on are part time professors.    I hear that South Korea has a great need for rockstar teachers as well, taught online, they are sort of prep schools high in demand. I'm starting to notice that all of my ideas are related to teaching, I'm not really sure what people do with degrees if they don't work in their field. Oh yeah, non profits are a great way to earn some money by giving expertise. Think of those people hired by non-profits as sort of lobbyists for good causes. You would be hired in an advisement and procurment capacity, and be prized if you are either: * Good at raising money * Have deep networks of people with expertise related to the non-profits * Know other people that can raise money * Have expertise yourself that can help direct or organize that non-profit This would satisfy the 'Giving Back' mentality you have, and would also force you to be connecting with people. You can also make some spending money doing this. The best part is that  these non profits can be anything you want, as long as you can convince others you are making some effect in the world that they also want to see but do not have time to enact themselves. There is a company in my town that helps people with ideas try to connect into non-profits and get experience managing them or just being involved.

digitalnomad,393yj5,magictravelblog,2,Wed Jun 10 03:28:59 2015 UTC,"Here's my 2 cents worth.  Carry on at the job, save that cash. Before you leave your job, invest it in a diversified fund, or invest in property, (in a country/market with good rental returns). Have your cash generating something of an income, rather than just sitting there doing nothing.  Then travel to Asia. If for example you land in China, take up teaching. If you have any degree and older than 25, you can get a  legit Z working visa.   In a Tier2 city (Not Beijing or Shanghai) think slightly smaller, you can teach 3-4 hours a day, 5 days a week, weekends off. 15,000 RMB per month ($2,500 usd), free apartment, free meal/s at school, free insurance, bonus on contract renewal. In a Tier2 city and living like a king, a single person, it would be hard to spend more than $1k Usd per month.  In your free-time start studying code. Html/Css/Php/Javascript. Use free study resources such as codecadamy, codecombat, etc and paid sites (which slip my mind at the moment).   Do some freelancing to get your first gigs and build up some experience, apply for remote internship/back end, junior developer jobs.  Do this for a year or so, if you hate it, you will have an asset back in your country or cash in an investment portfolio, as well as the cash you made teaching.

If you use others to get you the job they are taking up to half or even more of your salary.   Private teaching is the best earner. There are lots of filthy rich Chinese parents that plan to send their kids abroad. I know of one American in Hainan, that teaches a handful of local kids, their parents are local government workers. The kids come over to his house for 5 hrs, 6 days a week. He just teaches them conversational English, forces them to speak nothing but it, no Chinese. He makes well over 25k a month."

digitalnomad,393td5,practicalpants,2,Tue Jun 9 01:39:59 2015 UTC,"I strongly agree with practicalpants. Nomad.network looks great, and I think there should be free/open chat groups as well. It seems reasonable that they be promoted on the sidebar. These are great resources for digital nomads. I created digital-nomad.slack.com (all the other variations of this name were already claimed) a while back, but didn't end up promoting it as another similar free/open slack group came along (albeit with a different focus, remote work).  I can easily afford to join the paid slack groups out there but I have avoided doing so out of principle.  Personally, I don't mind nomads making money off of other nomads, but I feel this should happen where the value is added, not on top of a free service.  That being said, everyone is free to do as they please.  This subreddit, being named /r/digitalnomad, should treat all attempts equally though.  As for spam, IRC does just fine without paid subscriptions. As a programmer, I'm used to joining very high quality communities that don't carry a price tag - value is provided by all internally.  Would love to hear more opinions on this!"
digitalnomad,393td5,theunisk,3,Tue Jun 9 08:35:43 2015 UTC,"Being free shouldn't be the metric on which a nomad community should be based.  It's usefulness should be.   If there's a resource added to be sidebar, it should include and arguably feature Hashtag Nomads.  I've already helped a dude find housing, met a fellow nomad in person, gotten a paid gig, and there are 70+ users for the channel of the city where I'm contemplating moving."
digitalnomad,393td5,Adealy,7,Tue Jun 9 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'm personally of the opinion that making Hashtag Nomads a paid community already is in opposition to its usefulness. I got in when it was free, later told a friend about it, and then it wanted to charge him, so he simply didn't bother signing up as the value wasn't apparent. Is the community really going to grow a lot with this new signup fee and be as valuable to everyone already in it?  I'm all for people paying for value on the internet, but the best communities and forums for other interests/lifestyles are usually free, and I don't think the go-to community for being a digital nomad should be a $30 paywall in front of a glorified chatroom. Currently I would recommend this subreddit to someone instead, but of course its not quite the same thing."
digitalnomad,393td5,ToastPop,5,Wed Jun 10 02:41:31 2015 UTC,"YMMV, but sure we can have the moderator's paid site alongside free alternatives. Make it a ""Community"" section. Just put a ""premium"" tag next to it and I'm OK with it.   Just in general I don't like the idea of nomads profiting off of other nomads, and as per usefulness, you can make a useful network and chat site that's free to use as well, and at least some people are attempting that. Not only for-profit stuff is useful."
digitalnomad,393td5,fabiand,3,Tue Jun 9 01:58:54 2015 UTC,"A section would be nice. All the services have their strength/weaknesses. I have been using http://findanomad.com/ and managed to meet some interesting people thanks to it. This one is really useful to meet people when you arrive in a new place and get a sense of who is where, however it does have it share of bugs."
digitalnomad,393td5,Adealy,3,Tue Jun 9 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Make it a section. Put them all there.  How much do they charge? $15? Shoot the mods a message, I'm sure they'll let you in for free. That's what they did for me.  The money keeps the chat from being flooded from undesirables and spam. That's why Airbnb is a much more useful community right now than Couchsurfing.  Have an easier way to vet people rather than charging money? Let's hear it."
digitalnomad,393td5,Adealy,4,Tue Jun 9 02:06:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're comparing apples and oranges to an extent, as CS & AirBnB are pretty different beasts. Either way CS is a fine community, and I usually attend CS meetups when I arrive in new cities just to meet a bunch of travelers.  I don't buy this ""instant spam"" argument...  I'm sure you can think of online communities that are useful that don't charge money.   FYI the moderator's site is $30+. I'm not saying that site is bad, I'm just saying it would be nice if we could promote free alternatives, like a resource for this community."
digitalnomad,393td5,levelsi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:47:03 2015 UTC,"CS Meetups are sweet, but that what it's become about these days. It's not about accommodation anymore.  I never said instant spam. But when a community gets traction, then you'll certainly find spam. And you can either deal with the bullshit of having to manually mod a community that big, or but up some barriers to stop spammers from getting in.  Again, is there an easier way to vet people than charging people? I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm looking for alternatives, because yes $35 is steep.   I still don't see why #nomads can't be a resource for this community. I think u/levelsi and u/v4o would love to see it get there too. It certainly has been a great resource for me."
digitalnomad,393td5,Adealy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, the spam really wouldn't be a significant problem, it's certainly overblown. Look at Reddit, Reddit is fine. There's still all the incentive in the world to moderate the site & keep it clean because the founders can still make money in ways that doesn't involve charging digital nomads (i.e. ads, affiliate links, etc.). ""Preventing spam"" is not a legit justifications for charging $30 IMO. At the least, wait until you have tons of traction and see if there actually is floods of spam, but there's no reason to charge $30 ""apriori"" on the guess that there will be spam. (Edit - also just that they have to list justifications for charging seems to me like a reason that maybe you shouldn't be charging.)  Ideally we can vote, if this community wants to put the moderators' for profit site on the side bar, sure, put it there, but just put the free alternative there as well, otherwise everyone will cry afoul (which I think they have in the past)."
digitalnomad,393td5,alwaysonesmaller,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:19:27 2015 UTC,"Great points here, it's not a guess though. We've tried free too, and what happens is an influx of hundreds of users per day and it becomes a mess. The last time was when he had it free for 24 hours and 500 people came in. The quality of chat dropped massively.  Anyone is free to open their own forum/chat etc. I don't see why it can't co-exist? Look at TropicalMBA's Dynamite Circle (DC), they're doing fine too and charge I think $150 per quarter? Launch something free and see where it goes."
digitalnomad,393td5,levelsi,2,Wed Jun 10 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, it can co-exist. It's just while the free variations exist, I think we should promote them on the sidebar. It seems like a no-brainer... just a free resource to help nomads, why wouldn't we promote it? nomad.networks seems like a fine first candidate, they have quite a few people in my current city already."

It's mid to low 20s, very cheap (only slightly more than Thailand), safe, connected, and near Kenting, which has lovely beaches. Also, it's not touristy at all and easy to meet locals.  It's about as cheap a modern developed city can possibly be."
digitalnomad,38tq3i,twelvis,4,Sat Jun 6 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"I second Kaohsiung. Warm, there is beach and there is a decent metro system for getting around."
digitalnomad,38tq3i,magictravelblog,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to be honest I knew nothing about it until about an hour ago. I've been reading quite a bit about it and it seems like the best option so far. The only complains I've read are about how hard it's to find a place to rent without a local and the lack of Western food, something I don't care much about (some of my friends might, though).  It looks like a very livable city, right? Do people generally speak English there?"
digitalnomad,38tq3i,twelvis,3,Sat Jun 6 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"I stayed in a hostel (who's name I can't remember) owned by a friendly British guy who had apartments to rent. This was before Airbnb was popular, so it might be easier now.  Yes, there is a lack of Western food. However, not only is Taiwanese food very good and diverse, it's extremely cheap; in fact, it's uneconomical to cook. Many apartments don't have kitchens!   KH is not exactly a cosmopolitan city like Taipei (also a great place but colder and pricier than KH). It's the kind of place where people will look for excuses to practice their English with white people. As such, the overall level of English is pretty low, although younger people learn it in schools and take interest in Western culture.   Fortunately, I've found Taiwanese people to be extremely friendly and helpful regardless of their English ability. Stare at a map for more than a minute, and someone will offer help. As a seasoned traveler, you will be relieved to find there are virtually no touts, hustlers, or con artists; people genuinely just want to say hello. If you're patient, you'll have no issues. IMHO, KH is quite livable."
digitalnomad,38tq3i,magictravelblog,6,Sat Jun 6 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"Stare at a map for more than a minute, and someone will offer help. As a seasoned traveler, you will be relieved to find there are virtually no touts, hustlers, or con artists; people genuinely just want to say hello.   We certainly found this to be true. We spent six weeks in Taipei then spent two weeks doing a lap of the island. Spoke negligible Mandarin and absolutely zero Hokkien but still got by as on the rare occasions we got really stuck someone would always pop up and offer to translate for us.  Particularly as we had just spent 9 weeks in Cambodia, which is tout/hustler/con artist central, it was absolutely amazing. I kept waiting for the scam but it never came. People would just help us, say ""I hope you enjoy your visit to Taiwan"" or similar and then go on their way.  Our very first day in Taipei we stopped to look at a fruit shop, the guy who ran it came out and said hello, found out it was our first day in Taiwan so he dashed around and filled a bag with all of his more unusual produce, gave it to us, said ""welcome to Taiwan"" and refused to take any money. After being perpetually on our guard for so long my wife and I were both in shock."

The 10 year visa for Americans is for either tourists or business. The longest duration of stay (time allowed in country) ive heard of is 90 days, 60 days is the most common.   So they all live in a areas close to Hong Kong. Every 60 or 90 days fly there, then return to china, get stamped back in and continue doing this for the 10 years visa validity period."

digitalnomad,38tq3i,JaggedG,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:48:28 2015 UTC,"You can ask around and see about getting other types of visas through an agent.   They can be pricey (particularly if you need them to find/make you a sponsor company, invitation letter, etc.) but if you want, it's definitely possible to get a year-long working visa for around 10,000RMB ($1600 USD)   Cheaper options include business visas, or extended tourist visas, but the latter usually has that 60-90 day stay limit. Depends how long you want to stay and how much it's worth it to you to avoid leaving the country every 2 or 3 months."

digitalnomad,38tq3i,magictravelblog,2,Sun Jun 7 12:39:28 2015 UTC,"Malaysia is a nice spot however I am unsure of the legal situation regarding poker. From what I hear there is a cruise ship permanently based in Penang that does 24-72 hour long cruises that apparently just involve heading out into international waters to allow gambling so there is presumably cultural acceptance of gambling even if there are legal hurdles.  If you are looking at Malaysia I would suggest Penang, Melaka or Kuching. Penang is the most ""big city"" of the three while Melaka and Kuching are much smaller. Kuching has the benefit of being on Borneo so you can get out into the jungle.  I am unsure of the net situation in Kuching. We went there as part of our honeymoon so work wasn't part of the plan.  Net in Melaka was acceptable for us but we only tried it at one guest house that we have stayed at repeatedly.  Net in Penang is varied place to place (as it is anywhere). Stayed one apartment that had woeful net, one that had pretty good net, cafes frequently have decent free wifi, right now staying somewhere with our own 4 Mbps connection and that has been great. Either 4 or 8 Mbps seems to be common for homes so perhaps ask specifically before booking.  Be aware that your TV often runs over your net connection. TM seems to be the most common company that provides this set up but there are others. 4 Mbps is the minimum for a place with TV over the net and your TV will generally work fine provided you aren't hammering the net connection on your laptop. You may however want to turn off the TV if you are doing something where speed matters online. I have repeatedly thought ""huh, net is a bit slow today"" before realizing that there is some HD program on the TV that we aren't even watching. 8 Mbps presumably provides enough speed that you don't have to think about this.  The upside of this TV over the net set up is you get a whole bunch of international channels so you can flick back and forth between Japanese news, Australian football, Canadian ice hockey, Korean dramas, Chinese music videos etc."
digitalnomad,38tq3i,magictravelblog,2,Sat Jun 6 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"They don't care about live poker and they can flight to Cebu or Macao for that. It's only online poker that has to be ""allowed"". Online poker is illegal in Malaysia, but the question is if they actively look for players to fine/jail them.  Thailand used to be a safe place, but there have been some very shady cases recently where players have been arrested, extorted and robbed by the police. What's worse, they seem to be working with foreigners who tip them off.  Penang is another place we were considering, but we thought JB would be a better option. I'll try to read more about it."

I've only really passed through JB on the way from Singapore to KL but my impression was not great.

digitalnomad,38n0xe,magictravelblog,3,Fri Jun 5 11:08:40 2015 UTC,"I currently have the E-M5 Mk II with a bunch of lenses at the moment but it wasn't always like that.  I used to be a semi-professional photog and decided to sell my gear (well, everything) to travel. I dumped my DSLR for a Sony rx100m3 thinking the camera was super powerful and would soothe my needs for full manual etc. I also travel minimalistic so having a full-sized DSLR was out of the question. I try to get everything I own (clothes, bags, tech etc) to around 20 pounds of weight.  After 6 months of traveling with it, I realised that I couldn't deal with the simplicity of a point and shoot. I hate menus and zooms. I need buttons and fast glass. So I met myself in the middle and got a mirrorless.  Am I worried about theft? No. But I know it could happen. I'm not stupid. I just practice common sense and don't let it be put in situations where it could get stolen easily.  I chose the EM5MII because it's a fairly tough camera. Splashproof, dustproof and shock proof - basically me-proof. If you know me, I regard tech as tools and will chuck gear around and freak anyone out. So far, I haven't broken it. (BTW, my Sony RX100M3 broke in a matter of weeks). I'll respect gear that I borrow from other people but if it's mine, I'll end up eventually punting it one day.  In the end, you need to choose what suits you. If you are a photographer, choose the tools that suit your style. Don't make the mistake I did and assume you'll change your style completely to suit the tool. The tool needs to suit the user.   If you aren't a photographer, choose what works for you. If you can, test gear out for a weekend. If you're OK with lugging gear around, an interchangeable lens camera may work for you, in that case, Olympus' OMD range is awesome. If you're too worried about theft, a smartphone may be the best camera for you (iPhone 6plus or Samsung Galaxy S6) as you'll always have it with you. Buy a tough case and you'll be fine.  tl;dr: I carry the OMD EM5MII. Theft isn't a worry if you use common sense."

When I felt unsure I had a PacSafe to wrap all around my gear and lock it to bathroom stuff or beds whatever would be hard to pull off.  I have also left this gear unattended for 12hrs plus a few times at a backpackers in an unsupervised room on more than one occassion, so yea I guess sometimes you just hope shit doesnt get stolen and make sure your bag is very plain an boring and let no one see what you are actually carrying.   I also did tape over my canon label and 6d label and took a old looking camera strap instead of something that says hey look expensive camera.

Aside from being a helpful resource I've found it's a great link to send to people to quickly explain what I do.  All of the new filter options are great. I especially like the little icons used to illustrate all of them. The ability to filter by clicking on the columns in list view is also a nice feature.  Layout-wise I'll admit I miss the full-screen design of the current version. It allowed you to scroll the page and still have the filters visible at the right side of the screen, while in the new version you make your selection at the top and then scroll down the page.   BTW I'm wondering how the internet speed of the different locations is determined, given that this is one of the main factors someone is going to be looking at. Judging by my experience, it seems high in some places (I never came close to experiencing 90 MBPS in Las Vegas for instance) and too low in others (Vietnam is generally known for super fast internet, but rated poorly here).  One place where it seems like the site could expand is when a location is clicked. Right now you get a page that aggregates the various data, but it's missing first-hand information about what it's like to live there. I would almost expect to read a brief description of what the place is like, how good the co-working spaces are and other info that might help me make my decision."
digitalnomad,38jeao,water99211,8,Thu Jun 4 18:09:18 2015 UTC,It would be cool to have a tab where nomads posted their reviews or experiences in certain locations with a 1-5 star rating.
digitalnomad,38jeao,water99211,2,Thu Jun 4 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"Nice idea! How would that look like? I have the Questions tab now that's sourced from the http://nomadforum.io, what else could I add?"
digitalnomad,38jeao,istorical,2,Thu Jun 4 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah those questions are nice, I guess In my mind I was imaging something similar to a tab with Yelp styled reviews - except for a whole country/city :)"
digitalnomad,38jeao,wololograph,2,Thu Jun 4 22:26:03 2015 UTC,trying to do this at http://www.istorical.com but finding / found it kind of hard to build momentum.
digitalnomad,38jeao,carolinax,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:07:45 2015 UTC,Yep. I was thinking of crowdsourcing the guides here: http://nomadlist.com/guides/ I paid people to write them (and sell them for $10-$20) but maybe better to just open it and make $ in another way? Like a wiki?
digitalnomad,38jeao,yuekit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"The always visible filter options were OK on a desktop. However, on a phone they obstructed the content, especially on smaller screens."
digitalnomad,38jeao,pjcelis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, mobile is one of the main reasons for the re-design. Mobile traffic is now about 52%."
digitalnomad,38jeao,pjcelis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:34:38 2015 UTC,i view the site as it is on mobile and i think it looks better currently than with the redesign - being able to see the actual cities is waay cooler and makes me want to click on the cities than some stats.
digitalnomad,38jeao,VARGames,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:06:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yuekit! Do you think I could make the top filters sticky a bit? Like a fixed bar when you scroll down? E.g. AirBnB's filters they slide open and then slide up to a compact bar again.  Internet speed is averages, and from several sources. I will keep improving that and the other data by using more sources and averaging it. Thanks."
digitalnomad,38jeao,VARGames,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:33:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the way AirBnb does it is pretty slick. Allows you to quickly readjust your settings without taking you out of the context of the search. Also you can scroll within the filter pane so it can potentially accommodate a lot of options.
digitalnomad,38jeao,VARGames,3,Fri Jun 5 08:44:34 2015 UTC,"I like the website and think you will do well.  Two thoughts:   I see no data for local cost of living I am an expat but spend like a nomad apparently, your new lower cost of living data makes me feel bad ;)"
digitalnomad,38jeao,inspireNomad,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, pjcelis!  Can you click ""local"" on the filter tab? It will change all prices to local prices. You can switch to nomad or expat."

digitalnomad,38jeao,kapziel,3,Sat Jun 6 10:42:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need this or that options for a few of the search options. I'm not sure why anyone would want a High Congestion area for instance.  Also, I don't know your backend, but it seems you're filtering rather than prioritizing. You could instead weight the things the users selects as some might have to compromise in one area to find the best place.  Finally, I'm not sure what free on the free (secular) button means. Being free in terms of freedoms such as freedom of speech could be a filter, but it doesn't seem like that's what it is. If it just means religious or not, then secular by itself seems fine. You could potentially alienate some of your audience by indicating that religious is the opposite of free (or educated as indicated by the symbol)."
digitalnomad,38jeao,alwaysonesmaller,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, weighting would work. How would that influence the sorting though?"
digitalnomad,38jeao,hemayya,2,Thu Jun 4 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you do the scoring, but I would think you could do something like:  score = wifi points * (weighting) + price * (weighting) + etc.  Then I could say time zone doesn't matter to me, so weight that 0. Number of nomads matters so weight that 1.5. Then just sort on score. There's many more decisions there to make depending on whether or not you want scoring to be an absolute or relative value, but that's up to you.  You don't need to have the weights directly selected by the user (though it could be fun for me and perhaps some others), but just change the weight based on what buttons are selected."
digitalnomad,38jeao,Bair8xiu,2,Thu Jun 4 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, so make a personal score right? Yeah I wanted to do that, where you Sign In with Twitter/FB and then it asks you a few Qs and gives you your personal scores for cities."
digitalnomad,38jeao,junglepockets,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:42:15 2015 UTC,"Right. Personally, I would prefer to have the option to not have to log in and just selecting my preferences when I want to use the site, but I would be willing to create an account if I used the site enough or used that account for other sections of the site."
digitalnomad,38jeao,Bair8xiu,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:56:10 2015 UTC,Would you be OK with just singing in via Twitter/FB like e.g. Product Hunt?
digitalnomad,38jeao,junglepockets,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:34:33 2015 UTC,The end goal is being able to use that account to also ask questions on http://NomadForum.io and sign in to http://hashtagnomads.com etc.
digitalnomad,38jeao,Bair8xiu,3,Sun Jun 7 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"The thing I feel is missing is on/off season for tourism, this seems like an important factor that isn't really included on the site.  I think the internet speed should be a range, voluntarily picking ""slow"" feels odd because I don't think any digital nomad wants slow internet."
digitalnomad,38jeao,sinerider,2,Thu Jun 4 21:48:04 2015 UTC,"Nice, maybe make that one a slider instead? Like the cost slider?  And yes, seasonal date is next. That's hard to get right though, I do have some data on Q1, Q2, Q3 or Q4 (see expanded filter)."
digitalnomad,38jeao,sanyatark,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:07:04 2015 UTC,Ya I think it should be similar to the cost slider.
digitalnomad,38jeao,bananabastard,3,Sat Jun 6 07:23:38 2015 UTC,"This looks great. It's still got some significant performance problems on my older iPad (2? 3?), but it's generally better than the main site.

digitalnomad,38jeao,iamdylanshaffer,6,Tue Jun 9 01:05:15 2015 UTC,"Let's talk about the technical aspect ...   A quick rerverse ip lookup told me that you host a shitload of pages on the same server.  That's ok for small projects but not for so many sites with high traffic, you can tweak as much as you want, it won't help you.  I'd suggest you split it up a bit, how about a new server ?  What kind of caching do you use? I'd suggest memcached .  Pagination would also help ( if not already implemented ), where you basically load data on scroll, which would improve performance as well.  I can't take a look at your database queries, but this could be also a huge problem, you should check for n+1 queries.  Do you know new relic, this tool is very helpful to identify bootlenecks in your apps.   You could reduce the size of the images, check out google page speed, usually they provide good suggestions on page speed."
digitalnomad,38jeao,carolinax,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:56:59 2015 UTC,"Was there any real need to list all the websites on his server? Perhaps the OP has been working on some stuff he didn't want people knowing about.  Sure, 'the information is already out there, you just need to look it up', but come on dude, you can also get the name, address and email of most website owners, but that doesn't mean you should reveal such personal information just because you can?"
digitalnomad,38jeao,sinerider,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't thought about that, it's always about the intention.

I inputed ""China"", returned results for China/Thailand/Vietnam, etc.  Other than that, everything else worked fine.  One other question for you, how are you sourcing the information? For example, I clicked on Shenzhen. You rated Fun as ""bad/red"", when there is a shitpot ton of things to do in Shenzhen, it's a Tier1 city. Same as with English, more local chinese and the large expat population speak it there, than any of the other lower Tier cities."
digitalnomad,38jeao,validated1,0,Fri Jun 5 03:05:00 2015 UTC,"It's very subjective for sure, leisure/fun is based on how much stuff there is to do for nomads. I'll see if I can research that again for Shenzhen and improve the score."

Unless this site is specifically for five star ultra deluxe super furnished rentals/hotels, in which case, well .. touche!   :D   Not to trash on your website though, in general, I think it's lovely and I commend you for all the clearly-hard-work you've put into these sites!!! :)"

digitalnomad,38jeao,wololograph,2,Sun Jun 7 23:21:32 2015 UTC,Site feels slow/laggy. Why are you loading ALL the places on initial load? Surely makes more sense to load the first say 20 and then I can click 'load more' if I want?
digitalnomad,38jeao,SteveRD1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:33:30 2015 UTC,"It does, but also doesn't. 75% of users click a filter in the first 5 seconds in which case all cities have to be loaded any way. That would take longer than initial load. 500 <tr> items isn't a problem for most browsers. I think it's a bit laggy on older devices (e.g. MacBook Air etc) because of the lazyloading of images. I'll try and optimize that.  Update: optimized lazyloading now, it'll be speedier now on slower devices."
digitalnomad,38jeao,bigoil55,2,Wed Jun 10 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"There seems to be one important thing missing: Visas / Permits.   I saw Minsk pop up in the list with 82%, but if you are not Russian, you can't even get a visa for Belarus if you don't have a tour booked or hotel booked. It's an extremely restrictive country.   On the other hand, India offer 6months visas for most, 10year visa for US citizens.   China requires you to get a visa through an agency or a booked tour, while Japan, Korea and Taiwan all let you in for 90days, no questions asked.   Shouldnt this be reflected somehow?"

I'd really like to see a more eye-friendly color scheme. Even utilizing similar colors to those that you have, but turning them down a tad. I visit the site, and visually I feel like I'm being attacked. You're displaying a lot of information, and the color palette you're using doesn't allow the user to ease into that information.  Just my opinion, but I really feel it would help."
digitalnomad,38i8yz,misskinky,5,Thu Jun 4 11:47:21 2015 UTC,I can't believe they are charging 27K a year?! TIL: People will pay a lot for this convenience.

digitalnomad,38i8yz,Troy19,5,Thu Jun 4 14:32:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely expensive; I think this is geared more towards people with steady, well-paying jobs who want an experience for a year rather than people who really embrace the solo travel / digital nomad lifestyle. I still thought it was an interesting article and it could be helpful for some people who might read this. It mentioned several different companies and options. Maybe you should indeed start another one, since this will probably be a booming business as internet access gets more stable worldwide in the next 5 years!  Personally, I'm still gonna go my own way. The money will go so much further, of course. But it's exciting to me to see people opening up to the idea of ""location independence."""

digitalnomad,38i8yz,asuh,0,Thu Jun 4 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Why this amount isn't such a bad thing: All travel expenses and bookings taken care of by them, 24/7 internet everywhere you go, private accommodations in every location, and insurance to boot. Solo travel is a lot of fun but when things fall through and you don't have a backup, or you can't find stable internet or it costs a lot to buy into someone else's internet, etc. it adds up.  Also, with some of these locations you're looking at staying where everything's happening. Sure, I could go around the world and travel for much cheaper by living on the outskirts of cities or towns instead of in the center.  All in all, it's not for everyone but for the right people this is quite the experience to have for a little bit of a premium cost."

It's hard to go back to a ""9 to 5."" :("
digitalnomad,38ffiw,Poggus,5,Fri Jun 5 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"I stopped traveling after four years in a motorhome. I've been in a rental house in Austin for a little over a year, and had parked in the same RV park in Austin for a couple of years before that (with a few months of relatively short stints of travel during that time). So, I'm three years into mostly being non-nomadic. I'd lost two loved ones (my father, which was really rough, and, my dog, who'd been my traveling companion as well as best friend for 14 years) when I made the decision to stop traveling for a while. I needed some stability and friends around me.  That said, I'm planning to hit the road again in a couple of months, once I sort out a few things, and either renovate or sell and replace my motorhome. The appeal of being in one place has faded again, and I miss the road. I will likely still consider Austin ""home"", as I've started another business that is based here and cannot be made mobile, so I'll have to have storage here, and will likely come back for the busy season of that business next year.  It wasn't a tough adjustment. There are tradeoffs. It's nice to be able to have a garden. It's nice to have lots of room for stuff. I have a little wood shop in the garage, and that's been fun. It's nice to be able to have normal relationships (I'm taking a girlfriend with me this time around; I traveled solo almost entirely last time, though occasionally lovers would join me for one short leg of the journey). It's nice to be able to connect with the same people over a long period of time. But, it was nice waking up and walking out to the beach. Or, sitting outside the motorhome in the middle of the desert and being able to look up and see seemingly millions of stars because the nearest city is 80 miles away. The flexibility of being nomadic is hard to beat.  In short, normal is easier than nomadic, generally speaking. So, going back to it can actually be relaxing in a way."
digitalnomad,38ffiw,SwellJoe,2,Thu Jun 4 03:06:16 2015 UTC,I know someone who may be interested in that motorhome if you ever want to sell it.  Just need to let her see your motorhome to check i tout. She's been wanting to move out of her apartment in Cedar Park and live in an RV in a RV park.  I'm also sorry about what happened with your two loved ones.
digitalnomad,38ffiw,silencegold,2,Thu Jun 4 04:06:16 2015 UTC,"If she's wanting to stay put in one location, a motorhome will be unnecessarily expensive. A travel trailer or fifth wheel can be pulled into place for a few hundred bucks, and stay put. With a motorhome you're paying for a huge truck, in addition the the house stuck on top of it. Motorhomes really only make sense if you're moving around a lot.  One of the reasons I'm thinking about selling it (which is probably going to happen, if I can get it ready to sell quickly enough) is because the next time I travel, I plan to take it more slowly. Drive for a few hours, then park for a month, drive a few hours, then park for a month, etc. The more time it spends parked vs. moving, the more it makes sense to not have a motorhome, and instead have a trailer.  In my case, I already have a big diesel pickup that I bought (cheap!) because of the other business I mentioned. Selling the motorhome will just be a nice bunch of cash that I can spend on a <$10k trailer and a shit ton of new solar panels.  So, in short: Yes, I will be selling the motorhome, almost certainly. And, yes, it'll be a good deal because I need to sell it fast. And, it's a pretty nice tiny house. But, your friend probably shouldn't be shopping for a motorhome if she wants to park it and leave it. And, she probably doesn't want my motorhome if she wants something super cheap...it's a 2003, 34.5', class A, with a big slideout. It'll go for ~$22k (I'm not sure exactly what I'll sell it for, as I've only done a cursory glance at comparable prices...I paid $31k for it ~six years ago, and the model I have seems to be going for $18k-$28k now, depending on age and condition).  If your friend has questions, feel free to shoot her my email (same as my username at gmail). I'm a total RV nerd. I love them, and have a lot of familiarity with a wide variety of both classic and modern RVs, and I'm happy to talk about them with folks new to the idea of living in one full-time."

We are going to focus on enjoying the things we missed while we were traveling.  And if we can do this right, we'd like to be able to just pack up and travel for a year or two every now and then.

Instead, I forced myself to make a U.S. income while living in Chiang Mai, Thailand and trust me, it is 1,000,000 times better not having the B.S. and stress of being back home.  Now I have money, free time, and no stress. Plus I have the world as my playground. Back home I would have just had a normal life."

Use a cloud backup service for the offsite backup. I recommend CrashPlan, but there's heaps out there. Do your research and find the one that suits you best. You definitely need a separate bag for your laptop. Never put that in your checked luggage. Don't put anything valuable in your checked luggage except for one of the backup drives (because you need them separated, in case one bag goes missing). As others have said, encrypt your drives."

I'm not sure on particular colors, but every salon I walk in/by has a wide selection of hair colors available on display.  The supermarkets also carry a wide assortment of hair color--at least as large as a typical supermarket back home.  As others have said, you can also try to order your preferred color online.

Any good salon in large cities like Bangkok or HCMC will be able to match most natural colours and a few shades of unnatural red. If you mean just a box of hair dye that you can buy at a drugstore, there will be less variety than in the States, especially reds. If you are looking for unnatural colours like blue, I have never seen them for sale outside of Bangkok.   I'm not familiar with the Goldwell brand.

Okay, I went and looked back at our budget spreadsheet and see that in November 2014, I paid 1,450,000 dong (55 euro at the time) for a bleach and colour in HCMC, Vietnam. I paid 72 euro for colour and a trim in Chiang Mai, Thailand in January 2015. Bali was much more expensive and I forgot to write it down. Still less than the 80-120 euro I would have had to pay in Dublin. And that, completely exhausts my knowledge of hair colour in SE Asia. : )"

Being disconnected/lonely sometimes if you're in a place without friends or other nomads/expats and you're an outsider to the locals. People always thinking you're lost or running away from something (or thinking you won the lottery or have a sugar daddy). Smoking."

This is what made being a nomad so appealing to me when I was a teenager.  Also loved the feeling of being an alien. I know, after 8 months of language barrier, you start craving an intelligent conversation in a language that you grasp. But then when I'm in places where I understand the locals and their language, I find difficult to find like-minded people... and that's where the digital nomad community comes handy, with so many interesting individuals roaming around, sharing stories, their expertise and eventually even their couch if circumstances require it."

Most people don't move all that often & a lot of people stay in the same metro area or hometown they group up in.  But as a digital nomad, you can live ANYWHERE! It makes it that much harder to pick a spot and stay there (when there are so many alternative options to choose - ala paradox of choice).

There's a couple things that could easily be a hate, but I really like that I'm forced to motivate myself. Reporting to other people is easy, being responsible to yourself is hard. I've really been enjoying it. I also am a super anxious person so unpredictability makes my stomach lurch. I've always thought exposure is the best therapy though, so that's what I'm doing.  Hate: Man I have a new baby niece and I really wish I could go see her, but in reality it probably won't be for another year. I've always been pretty independent, but as I'm getting older I've started to cherish time with family a lot. It sucks having to choose between them or travel.

You mentioned Berlin, this is a startup hub, there are people living and working there without even knowing a single word German, simply because they don't have to, everyone speaks English there.  Vienna is a different topic, it depends a lot on your dev-stack, I personally met a few people willing to offer remote jobs and they also spoke english ALL THE TIME ( simply because not everyone was speaking German ).   You could check out karriere.at, which is basically a job website for Austria, you just search for an English keyword, if the job description is in English language, then guess what, they will probably hire you even if you don't know German.  I'm not in the position to judge this:   I am proficient with HTML/CSS/Javascript and am looking for job opportunities abroad   but this sounds more like a person who just started learning web development, you need solid skills in relational databases and NOSQL, just plain Js won't make the deal for you, you should have a working knowledge in a MVC JS framework like Angular, Ember etc...   You would increase your chances by a lot with a solid backend framework like Java Spring MVC, Ruby/Rails, Python/Django or PHP/Laravel/Sypfony2/Zend etc...

However, I do agree with Bair8xiu that knowing a popular JS framework will increase your odds immensely.

I'm looking for something that can switch easily between two bluetooth devices and is relatively ergonomic. Portability gets extra points for me but would come in third. (Jammingsloth and I are both looking for comfort and full size and both value portability to some extent.)  I was really intrigued by the Logitech K480, but at least one owner told me he wouldn't want to write all day on it because it wasn't especially comfortable, and PC Mag says it's not especially portable.  I know that ergonomic and folding don't normally go together, but I was intrigued by the split in the middle that the Microsoft Folding keyboard has. Many true ergonomic keyboards combine this split with a rise in the middle. On a flat, folding keyboard, is there any chance that the split in the middle still gives the keyboard an edge in terms of ergonomics?"

The tech has almost no practical application. Even with them speaking slowly from a script the translation is terrible. The only reason it appears to work is that each side already knows what the other is going to say.  The VERY FIRST thing he says is ""Good afternoon, Melanie.""  The German translation? ""Aber nach neuen, Melanie.”  In English that means ""But after new, Melanie.""  It was tripped up by a simple greeting. It completely lacks the intelligence to deduce that this particular combination of sounds in that particular setting is meant to indicate a greeting. It just matches words. The system has no human intelligence, no powers of deduction or critical thinking. It would fold like a house of cards if used for a real, complex and unscripted conversation.  To me these computer translators seem to be about the same as they were when I started translating in the early/mid 2000s. They're good enough to get the gist of a text but not much more. I don't think extra computing power will help much. This technology won't make another meaningful jump forward without artificial intelligence.  As it is now, these computer translations take so much work to correct into something dependable  that it would take less time to write themselves from scratch. Anyone proofreading these translations would also have to be as qualified as myself in order to detect all the less obvious mistakes that crop up due to the computer's inability to understand nuance and context."

I've only heard bad experiences about hiring Indian developers, though.   Of course there are good coders over there, but they're probably charging American rates since they 1. Are good 2.

Many ""lower cost"" countries do have good English options, but the fact that you have to seek it out deters a lot of people, they don't know how to find what they're looking for necessarily. They'll just hire someone they can speak to in person or on skype and be guaranteed cultural and linguistic understanding.  As soon as a developer from a low-cost country can deliver high quality and speak fluent English, they are already charging as much as local devs anyways because their low-cost competitors aren't competitors anymore."

On the surface it looks like a constantly changing environment, what with Angular (which is about to be completely redone with Angular 2), Ember, React, Django, Node, that IO spin off ...

So basically you're saying that we'll have true artificial intelligence in ten years, because that's what it would take to do my job (I translate German and Chinese to English) to a professional standard. At best, computer translation will make translation more accessible to people who don't care about quality, and who were not willing to pay for quality in the first place.  If computers can be taught to parse complex ideas and translate like a human does, then they can be taught to code, or to do any other thing which we rely on human intellect to accomplish. If translators are put out of work by AI, we will be far from the only ones on the bread lines.  As it is right now, nobody is going to buy high-end German products if all the documentation is translated into English using Google, or by some intern who had a year of German in high school and has to guess at what the original text actually means. Organizations with an image to uphold aren't going to use substandard written content.  Translation isn't going anywhere in the foreseeable future.  Comments like yours are good for my business, in a way. When people are talked out of translation as a career it allows me to demand higher prices as my skill set increases in scarcity."
digitalnomad,37uce9,tn18947,2,Sun May 31 11:55:57 2015 UTC,"I translate as well (English > Brazilian Portuguese), and my reply might (ok, it clearly does) reflect my own frustrations with the industry.  Of course, I don't think that machine translation comes anywhere near the work of a good translator now. But have you seen how fast we're creating new technology?   Even if it's not perfect, I bet it would be good enough that no proofreaders would complain after getting a MT document to proofread. I don't think it will be like doing it again. Not 10 years from now.  Also, re: if there's good machine translation we might as well teach them to code – as I'm sure you know, each language has it's identifiable patterns, and very likely a universal grammar behind all of them. Do you think it's easier to program machines to recognize those patterns and match them to the equivalent pattern in a different language, or to simply CREATE code out of nowhere?  Some of my other frustrations w/ the industry include: the academicism everyone seems to worship, high entrance barrier, lots of boring things to be translated."
digitalnomad,37uce9,ludysantana,1 point,Sun May 31 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"The high barriers to entry and boring work likely stem from the fact that you're a from-English translator. English is the most widely studied language in most countries, and Brazil is likely no exception there. It is only natural that you'd have more competitors.   As an English native speaker working from German and Chinese, I can be choosier about the work I pick due to my relative lack of competition. Most English native speakers don't take foreign language learning very seriously, as you probably have noticed, and because of that there is a relative shortage of into-English native speaker translators. My German department in college was very small, and most of my classmates never achieved a high level of fluency. I always keep this in mind when negotiating rates.   Most of the people I've met that translate into my source languages also complain of lower rates. China is especially bad in this regard since it is a lower income country with lower standards of professionalism. Brazil perhaps shares these same problems since it is developing country as well. Have you tried reaching out to European or US agencies?  Have you thought about translating from a less common source language? What are Brazil's largest trading partners? My brother in law is from Brazil, and I recall him saying that your country has close ties to Japan. German and Chinese are probably also not a bad bet. I don't know how realistic that is for you but if you are a language lover and digital nomad you could perhaps make it happen.  Aside from that, have you done much reading on the global market for translation services? There are a lot of bloggers out there telling translators about what kinds of agencies they should avoid.

Right... Teaching machines how to translate a fixed meaning in one language to the equivalent meaning in another is one thing... But if we want to draw a parallel with coding, writing a program from scratch would be closer to authoring a novel than to translating a document."

Only agencies at the low end of the market use translators who are not native speakers of the target language.   App localization in many cases represents the bottom end of the market. I've never had to take work like that. Most of the stuff I do serves a marketing purpose, and is intended to impress the end customer and/or other key stakeholders. Think advertisements, websites, trade fair brochures, corporate press releases etc.   Non-native speakers in poorer countries are nothing new. It has been easy to source such workers since before I started out 12 years ago (just have to go to ProZ.com), yet I'm still here. They can't compete in the types of market segments I an in. They are never a threat to me unless I chase after the same type of bulk market work that they do.  The types of ""subprime translators"" you speak of are the reason why we have sites like www.engrish.com.

It is rapidly becoming the dominant management paradigm, with something like a quarter of the global GDP (I can't remember the exact figure, but it amounted to something like 13 trillion dollars) being devoted to project-based endeavors.  (Nota bene: I've authored several case studies and white papers about project management... A process which involved a metric crap-ton of research (only some of which come to mind at this late hour), and interviews about project management with organizations that ranged from NASA to ivy league institutions.)   It is estimated that 1.5M new project management jobs will be created every year for the next 5 years, in fields that range from tech to construction, to architecture, engineering, etc). At the same time, the PM talent pool is also seeing a record drop in number of qualified practitioners, as the first wave of pm's begin to retire.   So that helps support the idea that there is a growing market need... But even more important, is the fact that effective project management leads to more successful projects... Which leads to more successful businesses. What is Gartner's figure on the majority of IT projects that fail to deliver their full value? It's mind-numbing... And often has very little to do with the quality of coding.   Even outside of tech, the need for project management has been spotlighted by the UN, as a major reason why so many international aid projects fail.   tl;dr: hazzing project management skills doesn't suck."

If it will truly become such an in-demand position, maybe 1 in 200 jobs is a large enough margin to give DNs a chance in the role.

digitalnomad,37unh2,otwu,2,Sat May 30 15:20:49 2015 UTC,"I tried this. Basically the 3 month tourist visa is your best bet. Just say you are on holiday. You might get away with one visa run if you leave for a few weeks, but you will likely get a 'very' final warning and this probably won't work twice.  Unless you have concrete evidence why a 3 month tourist visa is insufficient for your trip, I understand a 6 month B Visa is tricky to come by. Why do you need more than 3 months? Any hint of working remotely will not help your case. There are very strict rules that forbid any kind of work on a B1. You can do some things like attend conferences or sales meetings. But no actual remote work is allowed. A better bet for a 6 month B1 would be a leisure angle.   Setting up a business in the US is not a loop hole either. You still won't technically be allowed to work 'in' your business' on a B1. Only meet 'with' your business. And a 6 month long 'meeting' probably would be questioned. They would assume you are working for that length, and deny the B1.  There are E visa options if you can hire US workers in a US registered office, but I'd budget at least 10k in legal and 3 months time to get this off the ground, not including the costs of setting up the actual business. Reccomended revenue to think about this is $500k and three full time staff.   I don't think you need to provide proof of savings for a UK visitor visa, it's more about whether your story about why you need to be there holds up."

I'm considering telling immigration that I'm on a career break, which is kind of true in any case.

digitalnomad,37unh2,zubeye,2,Sun May 31 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"There is no way of enforcing it, no. But if you mention this on your visa application, that would be bad.   I wouldn't mention the career break. It's  good to show you have a job to go back to, or at least not draw attention to the fact that you don't.  If you mention, or they suspect, you are building a business (remotely , digitally or otherwise) on US soil they will reject the visa for sure. If you mention illness, you might need evidence of healthcare.  They are pretty good at their job. They have seen it all. You need a good story you can back up with evidence.  Or just go as a tourist."
digitalnomad,37unh2,neohampa,1 point,Sun May 31 14:02:34 2015 UTC,"This is very helpful, thank you.  I think I'm unlikely to get to where I need to in 3 months. It's going to be more like 6 months +/- 2 months until I'm recovered and financially stable. It's very important to me to be able to stay in the US for longer than 3 months for this reason.  Perhaps my best bet is to say that I've had depression for a long time and am going to a safe environment to recover? I can provide evidence of mental health treatment without any problem (eg receipts from my therapist). I could also explain truthfully why I am going to the US rather than anywhere else.  It might be quite hard to show I have a job to come back to. My business is just over a year old but doesn't bring in much money. Is there a way of construing this that doesn't look suspicious?   In terms of other ties to Germany, I could mention that I have friends and family here. I could also say that I've lived here for 18 months and have rented my current flat for 6 months.

One option would be to pay upfront for a course of 6 months of health treatment in the US, which would be a good reason to be there.   Otherwise you still havn't given a concrete reason why you 'have' to be in the US for more than 3 months. Wanting or desiring to to be there is not, sadly, a bullet proof reason,  In terms of ties, they are looking for things like house ownership, stable full-time jobs and kids I'm afraid.

You can't negotiate a good price as the middle man will not allow you to get anywhere near the correct price. The correction solution isn't to negotiate with them, it's to not do business with them.  I'd also be weary of places that use agents. In my experience the owners are too money hungry if they are using agents to bring people in (because it's obviously not selling itself at their non-agent prices).  tl;dr: real estate agents in Thailand are leeches. Don't bring them into this, they will only suck money out of you, there is no room to negotiate a fair price."

For reference, we went through a big site here, the owners are in Singapore and best we could do was a short three-way phone call but they pretty much left everything to the agent. Initial price was 21k, we got it down to 15k which is a huge saving, but when you consider the agent still made money from that you have some idea of just how much they add on top. They really are sharks.  Knowing what I know now, I'd browse the Thai language sites and Facebook groups and find a small house for the same price as a condo. Condos are way overpriced here in comparison, it's crazy."

Make sure you can earn enough to live without ever having to be anywhere — you have skills that lend themselves well to that.   But don't jump-then-look; if you're going to make a stab at freelancing, you do NOT want to have your first dry month in a foreign country you can't afford to live in or get out of.   Good luck!"

digitalnomad,37ns9i,sts816,14,Fri May 29 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"I used to spend anywhere from three to twelve months every year as a digital nomad. My employer is down with working remotely, which meant that so long as I had a reliable and reasonably fast Internet connection I could do 80% of my job from anywhere. Cue a high Australian income with Thai and Malaysian expenses...  The remaining 20% I'd get done during my fortnight at home every three months.  I only stopped because I went back home to go to school for a masters, but I'm certain that this is only temporary."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,notfinch,5,Fri May 29 00:30:40 2015 UTC,Did you just ask your employer if you could work remotely?
digitalnomad,37ns9i,notfinch,7,Fri May 29 00:35:38 2015 UTC,"Kind of. I'm a director of the family business - my parents and I are involved in information management in a reasonably specialised field. We have a team of geologists and programmers and we've always encouraged people to work remotely when possible. This was originally intended for parents of young children to spend a few days each week at home with them but eventually one guy went to Europe for a few months and kept programming, so I figured if he could do it... so could I.  The first attempt was three months and was a huge success, so I just kept going. If I weren't back at school I'd be doing it right now.  I've found getting out of the office and routine of daily life here to be invaluable and we now encourage all of our employees who can to do something similar every year. I had some great ideas when I was away, one of which has turned into a very promising product. Other ideas from programmers and geologists have helped our internal processes immensely, and they've also improved the products we sell to customers."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,notfinch,3,Fri May 29 01:48:59 2015 UTC,"Wow sounds like you have the dream situation lined up haha. What exactly does your work entail? When I imagine people generating their income online, I mostly think of programmers, graphic artists, writers, etc.; the most traditional remote jobs. I'm not trying to dig up your business or anything, just curious about other types of online work."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,purplegoodance,5,Fri May 29 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"Ha, no worries.  My work is fairly diverse. We're a fairly small operation, with only six of us here full time including my father and I. On any given day I'll be doing basic systems administration, research, documentation, liaising between our programmers and our geologists, paying employees, talking with our programmers about features we need or improvements that should be made, offering support to customers, checking the output of our software, dreaming up ideas that might become nothing, and all of the fun thing directors do like deal with accountants and lawyers and contracts and NDA's and deal negotiation.  The vast majority of that can be done from anywhere, but I find face-to-face interactions with our guys work so much better than Skype or the like. I mean, Skype works, but it's not ideal. Very few of our customers are local so talking/negotiating/supporting/etc by email or telephone is standard practice, anyway.  You raise an interesting point regarding the ""traditional remote jobs."" I think this is changing. A lot of my friends should be able to work remotely, but they're in industries in which working remotely is synonymous with ""getting paid to do nothing."" Yet they're still expected to answer emails while they're on holiday, or take phone calls, or take a laptop and work on something, or whatever.  It is a pretty sweet system. It suits our business and our employees very well. One guy is visiting family in Europe at the moment, and he's still getting his job done. In fact, it's 5:23am in Tallin (where he is now) and he's logged into the company VPN!"

digitalnomad,37ns9i,digdog7,11,Sat May 30 05:15:16 2015 UTC,"I do voiceover and audio production for radio. I travel with a ""portable"" studio, which is basically a microphone that has a narrow pick-up pattern, an interface, MacBook Pro and all the cords and wires. I go to a hotel or an AirBnB that is quiet, or wait until late at night when it becomes quiet, record the voiceovers and produce them at a coffee shop. In order to get the voiceover sound I want, I often have to turn off the a/c and put a blanket over my head. This means I can get hot and sweaty very fast, so a lot of promos and imaging pieces are recorded while I'm wearing just my underwear.  Edit: forgot to add that I also get to make cool pillow forts. The three-sided pillow forts along with the blanket over my head help to eliminate my voice bouncing all over the place, or reverb.  ...back to you."

Before I started traveling, I worked in San Francisco for a couple years and got connected to my clients there. For software developers looking for clients, I've heard good things about TopTal. You'll get higher rates than Elance or Odesk."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,Purpledrank,4,Fri May 29 01:40:20 2015 UTC,"I'm just about to get approved on Toptal, and I had to cut my rate in half, which they said was still too high ($70 per hour). Apparently they base it on your location, and I'm currently in Thailand. But I haven't been able to land any other gigs for a while, so this is a good backup.  Gun.io has a lot of jobs with reasonable rates, I'm hoping to land a gig on there soon. Seems like there's a lot of competition, though. Have also found some clients via Hacker News, AngelList, 500Startups, etc."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,fqn,6,Fri May 29 10:29:21 2015 UTC,"Gun.io has a lot of jobs with reasonable rates   Lol. They have about 2 gigs per week that is viewed by hundreds if not thousands of developers.  Those job boards, I have observed, are a waste. Unless you already turning down gigs left and right because you are a ninja, those places are an employers market.  Best bet is to cut those people out and find your own clients. Join business forums/conventions. You'll be a single dev amongst many potential clients/employers. Or find a single employer (on typical boards like indeed.com) and negotiate fully-time remote, no travel.  Con's of FT employer are that the timezones are kinda funky and this leads to loss of sleep."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,zheli,3,Fri May 29 11:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's weird, I've seen the ""Congratulations, your proposal was the BEST!"" email 3 times so far, but still haven't landed any gigs on gun.io. I almost had one, but then the guy changed his mind and didn't want to build the app anymore.  I like gun.io since the budgets are pretty high compared to other job boards. Most of the clients seem to be ok with paying $100+ per hour, but yeah, it's very competitive.  Good advice about business forums, I might give that a shot. I don't have any problems finding full-time remote work, though. I'm currently working on my own startup, so I'm looking for part-time remote work, which seems to be very difficult."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,fqn,2,Sat May 30 15:41:56 2015 UTC,I set my toptal rate to $55 and they said I may have problems finding clients. So I guess they need to keep the margin high:) I am in Sweden BTW so they don't just say that based on your location I guess.
digitalnomad,37ns9i,zheli,2,Sat May 30 13:12:49 2015 UTC,"Have you been able to find any clients so far?   My account just got approved, and have already applied for quite a few good jobs. But yeah, I guess we're kind of paying for the service by lowering our rates, so that they can bill us out at much higher rates and have a good margin. Kind of sucks, but it's a trade-off you make for stability and access to a good job board.  Even so, I've just decided that I'm probably going to put my TopTal account on hold for now, and keep trying to find clients at my normal rate."

The first one is free, the two other ones are at $2.99. I barely made under a $100 this months, so it's clearly not enough, but it's still good for two books! (They are novellas, part of a serial, around 20 000 words each).  The thing is my boyfriend does something very similar so I know I can do it to. I just have to keep writing. He makes between 3K to 6K a month, with over 100 books out (short stories).  The only trick to selling ebook is to keep writing! I see my sales go up every time I release a new book."

digitalnomad,37ns9i,isthisdutch,6,Wed Jun 3 23:29:26 2015 UTC,How did you get involved in this? Just sending out your work until you found a publisher or do you publish independently?
digitalnomad,37ns9i,bidzini,14,Fri May 29 12:09:15 2015 UTC,"I self-publish :) It's actually a lot easier than it looks! First, you write your book. Make sure it's good enough for you. Then I send it to an editor. Once I get it back, I do the formatting (not very hard) and the cover (you might want to outsource that if you're not good with Photoshop. Nice looking covers are essential!). Once all my formatting is done, I send the book to my two/three beta-readers (who give me a feedback on what they like/don't like). According to that, I make the necessary modifications to the book and make sure the formatting is still right. The last thing is I have to write the blurb, then I put everything in Amazon! A few hours later, it's available.  Since I don't have a publisher, it's important that I do my own marketing. That's why I have a Goodreads account, Twitter, Facebook page, etc. I have to be honest, I'm not super active on SM for my author name. Most of my sales, I get from people searching on Amazon. It's VERY important to have good keywords. They're the crucial part!  Also, my books are part of the Kindle Unlimited Program, so I also get money from borrows.  And that's all!"
digitalnomad,37ns9i,ReincarnationHappens,2,Fri May 29 12:51:41 2015 UTC,Really interesting. Do you think this would work with poetry as well?  Nice to see someone not techy on here. Absolutely not hating on techy guys here (you guys rock!) but it's nice to see something different.
digitalnomad,37ns9i,bidzini,3,Fri May 29 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"That's a tricky question!  The thing is you want to write what people buy... I'm not such poetry is a genre that sells a lot. But maybe it is! I'd just do some research first before starting anything :) I know romance does well, erotica does too, as well as mystery and sci-fi. They're the most popular genres, so the ones that are most likely to sell (in the fiction department anyway!)"

digitalnomad,37ns9i,bidzini,3,Sat May 30 19:16:51 2015 UTC,I started working on a this starting at the end of January this year. I wrote between 1-2k words a day until half way through March then I burned out. Now I am writing again but taking fri-sun off. I upped my word count to average 2.5-4k words to make up for it and it's much nicer than writing every day.  My best month was March at $400. With out producing anything for the second half of March through the middle of this month I still brought in around $200 a month.  I am hoping to get up to $1000 a month by the end of the year. At least then I can pay my bills and start saving up and once I hit $2000 start traveling.  It's funny because english was my worst subject in school.  As far as social media I haven't bothered with a facebook page or a tumbler page. I do have a twitter account but out of the few followers(5) I have ever only had one sale come from a tweet. I do have a newsletter set up through TinyLetter with 10 followers. I send one newsletter a month and the week I send it I get roughly 2-5 people from there buying one of my new books. So now I focus on growing my newsletter.

I have been slowly working on a longer work that I hope to have published by the end of this summer. It would be my first novel. So far it's sitting at 90k words give or take. I've set aside some money from my shorts so I will be able to higher an actual editor and artist for the cover once it's finished. I hope it goes well and if it does I have a second one planned out. If it flops I have written it so it can stand alone and I can start a new story in its place instead of a sequel.

digitalnomad,37ns9i,bidzini,1 point,Sun May 31 03:18:06 2015 UTC,"You want to know about the process of writing? Or everything else that comes after? Because to write the novel, I just... sat down and write? I read A LOT when I was a teenager (especially romance novels...) so I knew exactly what readers were looking for, the kind of characters they like/don't like, etc. It wasn't so hard for me to come up with a story, because I have a lot of imagination and I happen to be good at storytelling.  So basically, I just wrote about my characters in a notebook, outlined the story and I started writing! I used to try to write 2000 words a day, but it was too much for me. Now I'm going for 1000 words and it's a lot easier. I don't stop for weeks at a time anymore!  Did I kinda answer your question? XD"
digitalnomad,37ns9i,ReincarnationHappens,1 point,Sun May 31 12:04:13 2015 UTC,"So you definitely outline? I recently read K. M. Weiland's Outlining your Novel. I read all the time, and I've read a ton of books on writing too. I even majored in writing and started a few novels. I just always end up stuck on what happens next. Even in the outline process. Any advice that way? Also I'm curious about the market for shorter work that you mentioned? I'm very intrigued and impressed with you."
digitalnomad,37ns9i,Purpledrank,2,Mon Jun 1 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"I have a vague idea of what's going to happen. What I usually do is outline the big ideas, like where I want to take my book, etc. After that, I outline each chapter individually before writing it (and it often changes when I start writing, depending on how it feels for my characters, etc.) Then when I'm done with Chapter 5, let's say, I start thinking about Chapter 6 and 7, knowing that things are probably going to change. I give myself the freedom to change things if that's what fits more with my characters :) There's no point in following an outline if it doesn't feel right!  I read that it's a good idea to stop writing when you know what to write next. That way, you're inspired and want to go back to it the next day. Maybe try something like that?  About the market, I'm really not sure if I'm doing the right thing or not. I know releasing books more often is good, but then I can't tell vs having one big novel release how it would do. Not all readers like that, of course (especially romance reader), so I might be loosing some. But for the momentum it gives me every time I release a new novella, I think it's worth it. I plan to put everything in a novel-size bundle after the four parts are publish, so I'll see how that does then!"

So my name is Virginie, but I shortened it to Ginnie to make it easier for people to remember. Other than that, I used my real last name.

Obviously connecting in from a datacenter (eg:  tunnlr.com) would look silly and everyone would know I'm dicking around nomading. This way my privacy is secured the most for me. It's ironic that IPA advertises a private connection. There is very little private about having an ip from a clandestine dataserver. That is suspicious as fuck.  I also run a sort of internet kill-switch on my firewall. My firewall only allows me to connect to my home computer, this prevents my calendar from trying to hit the company computers as soon as I turn on my macbook.  I also have a seedbox for torrenting/private trackers. I also use port-forwarding on that seedbox (ie: a SOCKS5 server) if I want to go through there inside (faster speeds). My vpn config is smart enough to know not to route connections to my seedbox through my home openvpn server (bypass).  tl;dr: I use openVPN to my back in the states home for everything. I have a special rule that allows me to bypass that and use a seedbox located in Europe somewhere.  EIL5: chrome + all my other apps connects back to the computer in the states (needed so that I appear to be in the states).

digitalnomad,37kmw8,calcium,1 point,Thu May 28 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"You're right, the bandwidth is limited to 1 TB on the $5 a month plan so thanks for pointing that out. $10 per month will bump you up to 2 TB and so on so if you really need that much bandwidth then you can always pay a bit more for it. I personally have never even come close to using 1 TB of bandwidth in a month.  For a VPN you don't really need any disk space so I'm not sure how that's relevant here..."

digitalnomad,37kmw8,calcium,1 point,Fri May 29 15:08:21 2015 UTC,That's actually not a good idea. There's no guarantee that the disk contents of your box are backed up in case your instance gets killed by the hosting provider and it makes maintenance in general much more difficult. If you just run OpenVpn on the box then you can kill it and move it to a new location easily or move to a new linux distro etc... as long as you have the configs.  Instead of storing on a VPN you should use AWS S3 or Glacier (Or any other dedicated cloud file service) for file storage. It will be cheaper/easier in the long run than trying to maintain your own box and it is orders of magnitude safer than storing them on a single VM disk.

digitalnomad,37ce1e,zerostyle,3,Tue May 26 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"It is now fairly simple to get a motorbike license in Vietnam, just takes a week or so.  Travel/health insurance won't cover you if you are illegally driving and get in a crash, so you need a license for coverage."
digitalnomad,37ce1e,spyt,0,Tue May 26 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"Very few travelers have a week to stay in one place and get a license, though."

digitalnomad,37ce1e,spyt,1 point,Tue May 26 22:54:22 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I mostly wanted to point out the dangers of riding w/o a license.
digitalnomad,37ce1e,zerostyle,1 point,Wed May 27 01:15:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. Certainly there are lots of travelers that spend only a few days or a week in each city/country and they don't have time to spend a week getting a license. But some people spend several weeks or months in a country, and taking a week to get a license could be very feasible and sensible for them."
digitalnomad,37ce1e,gizmo777,3,Tue May 26 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"IMO traffic in Vietnam follows a very natural rhythm that allows you to keep your eyes on the road and not the signs/lights. The reason so many westerners get into bike accidents is that they put too much value on the official rules. They assume a green lights means it's safe to cross an intersection at 70kph. It is not, become part of the traffic flow instead and you'll be very safe."

digitalnomad,37ce1e,zerostyle,2,Thu May 28 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"It's because they drive scooters mostly. You should compare the fatality rate per mile driven between Vietnam motorbikes and US motorbikes, not Vietnam motorbikes and US cars."
digitalnomad,37ce1e,pjcelis,2,Thu May 28 04:19:37 2015 UTC,"Ya, it's hard to find good data on that.  Overall fatality rate according to this:  (both cars and scooters) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate - shows the US at 13.6 vs 65 fatalities per 100,000.  That said, the US rate for motorcycles was something like 70-80.  (of course, those tend to be bigger bikes, not scooters, and on highways).  I guess the difference isn't as much as I made it out to be, but the MAIN point of my statement remains the same.  Riding motorcycles is really dangerous.  Doing it illegally cancels out your insurance on it.  Your life can be ruined."

digitalnomad,37ce1e,brett88,5,Wed May 27 12:25:35 2015 UTC,"Those odds are for an average American citizen, not an average American traveler. If you travel outside the country, you've just increased your odds a very large amount over the numbers given in that article.  Really, those numbers are essentially useless. If you don't travel outside the US, your odds of any of those are 0. If you do, then your odds are way higher than those numbers. The only point I see in giving combined odds for the two groups like the article does is to (irrationally) assure travelers that they're safer than they originally thought.  It's interesting to compare the odds of different types of deaths, but the numbers should be compared against number of US citizens who traveled abroad over the year, or even better, number of days that US citizens spent out of the country that year (since some will have spent the whole year traveling and others will spend only a week). That way you could actually get an idea of the real risk of travel abroad."
digitalnomad,37ce1e,LookInTheDog,1 point,Wed May 27 10:38:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly, these statistics are absurd. What percent of the U.S. population travels internationally each year? 10%? Less?   And it makes no account for differentiating risk for those who spend 5 days abroad versus those who spend the whole year.  Also, to compare the ""danger"" of traveling, the deaths should be compared to the likelihood of death in the US. I bet the risk of death in a car (measured in deaths per million passenger hours) is higher in the US than the majority of countries."

digitalnomad,37ce1e,PFULMTL,3,Tue May 26 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"I knew of an expat that had a car acident in China, same city as me. it was a simple fender bender, he could of just paid a few hundred rmb from his pocket and been on his way.  Instead he played the white card and was adamant it wasn't his fault, wanted the other car to call his insurance and get them to pay to fix his car.  Now in China when you are involved in a traffic accident you cant move the cars in the street and when insurance is called out to the scene, police come with them.  Mr dumbass expat didnt have a Chinese drivers license and no you cant drive on the one from your home country. Police arrested him, 1 week in the detention centre, 10,000 rmb fine and deported. Blacklisted for 5 years.  Moral of the story, obey local laws, dont be a twat and get insurance."
digitalnomad,37ce1e,sanyatark,3,Wed May 27 05:08:25 2015 UTC,"Statistics like this just don't really give a good perspective at all. People tend to turn their brains off when they think there an an authority on the number.  Living in SEA, cars and motorbikes are incredibly dangerous. Not talking about driving them only, I'm talking about just even walking around outside near a big road. They don't really have sidewalks here, just a lot of random car activity that occurs along major and minor thru-roads.  tl;dr: SEA, vehicles happen. They appear out of no-where and hit pedestrians a lot."
digitalnomad,37ce1e,Purpledrank,2,Fri May 29 11:00:14 2015 UTC,"One thing that amazed me was how low the overall number was (""only"" 671 - by comparison, Australia with a population 1/15th the size of the USA averages 1200 international deaths per year).  The report does note ""the data are for the USA, where a surprisingly small proportion of the population travels abroad""; and my comparisons confuse all deaths with ""non-natural"" deaths so aren't an apples-to-apples comparison."

If you only ""need"" these things a few times a year then you don't really need them and buying an apartment just to store these non-essentials sounds ludicrous from a minimalistic standpoint."
digitalnomad,37a48h,8sweettooth8,6,Tue May 26 07:42:17 2015 UTC,"+1 for this approach. The only things I own that I don't carry with me are a few legal documents I don't want to carry (birth certificate, etc.) and I have those locked up in my parents' house.  Renting gear/tuxedos is easy enough, and probably far more convenient than taking a detour through you hometown before each ski trip."
digitalnomad,37a48h,jlengstorf,2,Tue May 26 07:17:54 2015 UTC,"Ditto. Rent the big stuff when you need it. Don't own it, and don't carry it around. The only large-ish thing I own and carry around is my winter peacoat."
digitalnomad,37a48h,sobri909,3,Tue May 26 13:23:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with your for the most part that less possessions leads to more happiness. However, the lack of both possessions and long term commitments to a home-base you lose the ability to get more into the activities you want to pursue and the relationships that come with them. Let's say I enjoy skiing, soccer and painting. Well sure when I'm on my digital nomad quest I can find a place to rent skis or buy some cheap cleats or buy some cheaper equipment to do art. However, skiing on rented equipment is nothing like skiing a pair of skis/boots that you have broken in and understand how they ride. Buying a throw away pair of cleats and playing with random people for a month is nothing like developing the relationship of a team over a longer period of time. I guess more than just a place to store stuff it's a familiar place to return to. Maybe after 60 countries and the better part of the last decade as a nomad in general the road has worn on me a bit, but these are things I'm starting to think about. I'm almost 30 and while traveling MUST be a part of my life for sanity sake the idea of living 60% in one place and 40% on the road is starting to sound appealing..."
digitalnomad,37a48h,n0damage,1 point,Tue May 26 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"Also, sometimes the cost of rental gear is so much higher than what it costs to buy that it's hard to stomach. I went snowboarding in Niseko a few years ago and the cost of renting all of the gear for a week was about triple what it would have cost to buy at home. And as you said, the quality of the gear wasn't all that great.   On the other hand there are some scenarios where you can buy equipment, keep it around for an extended period of time, and then sell it once you're done. That way you still get the benefits of having your own gear, but can recoup some of the cost at the end."
digitalnomad,37a48h,thatgrumguy,2,Tue May 26 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"The point I was trying to make is that by not wasting rent on a ""home"" base, you'd have hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to afford to buy new equipment. Once you're done with it, donate the equipment to someone who needs it. This is the point of being a minimalist digital nomad.  In my case, if I were to keep my house, I would have wasted $40,000 a year on a place that I didn't live in. If I were to downgrade that to a storage unit to store all of my material possessions, that would have been $10,000 a year. In my books, it worked out better to sacrifice all my ""stuff"" and use the savings to cover what I need, when I need.  This is a choice that I made and it works out well for me both financially and spiritually. It doesn't work for everyone, however if cost is the only issue, I'm at a loss to see how given the gains you'd have by not living in two places at once - especially when being a DN usually involves living in cheaper areas, stretching your dollar further."
digitalnomad,37a48h,n0damage,1 point,Wed May 27 01:12:18 2015 UTC,"Where do you live that it would cost $10k/year to store all your stuff? Or did you have a ton of stuff? Mine cost about $100/month.  I agree that you shouldn't spend a bunch of money on a house or apartment that you're not living in. Hence moving out and putting my stuff into storage so I was no longer paying for an apartment.  Of course with a house you have a few more options such as being able to rent it to someone else while you are gone. Depending on the rental market you might even make a profit from it.  But yeah, there's nothing wrong with buying and donating/selling once you're done with it."

All I have left is a suitcase at my parents' house back in the states with one dress up outfit, my diplomas and legal docs. I've gotten rid of everything else.  It's such a waste to keep an apartment or even a storage space in your home country. Get rid of your stuff, if it's not necessary to have with you, it's not necessary to keep. Your stuff will weigh you down throughout your life, learn to live without it and you will be happier overall. I don't think it's really mooching to be staying with friends or family while you are visiting. It's not like you are staying long term. If you feel bad about it, maybe take you're hosts to dinner or buy them groceries, cook dinner occasionally. Treat it like a couchsurfing arrangement."

I had been living in Brazil for the previous year so moving from the place in my home country was an easy transition.  I've reduced my posessions a lot in the last few years.  Most of the rest I put in a storage unit.  My parents are very kind to let me and my brother use their house as ""base camp"" for some of our gear (bikes, surfboards, climbing gear, camping gear, jackets, etc).  When I'm traveling, everything I carry fits in a 80L Osprey Ozone suitcase, and 35L Mammut backpack.  When I'm back in my home country, I usually travel the coast living out of my (south-)german sedan.  I switch between AirBnB's and hotels in a few different cities and towns.  My two packs fit in the boot of my car, with nothing visible in the passenger compartment.  Personally, I've reduced my posessions down quite a bit.  It's rare that I miss the things I've downsized from my life.  Most of what I have now is either work or hobby related.  I do miss all my kitchen gadgets sometime, and at least travel with a couple good chef/japanese Knives.  Relative to the agility of having less stuff and being able to fly anywhere at a moment's notice, I don't miss my old stuff much at all."

Most digital nomads I meet are on their first ever trip from their home country, so they are loving the new found freedom of junk.  Do this for a few years though and you begin to miss some token items in each of your locations.  That's why my long term plan is to mostly bounce around 3 or 4 locations each year, leaving things that I want in each place. The goal is to buy houses in each location that have a suite next to them and be wealthy enough to keep the suite empty when I am not there. The income from the houses pays the way.  Furthermore if you are a sports/car enthusiast it is even harder again, so I plan on having a good sized garage in one of my playgrounds.  Certainly pie in the sky stuff though, I'm not sure where I am going to find that sort of money just yet!"
digitalnomad,37a48h,PFULMTL,6,Tue May 26 13:39:33 2015 UTC,"I'm always impressed with the folks that have been on the road for 5+ years.   I've done 2 separate year-long nomadic stints and I've found that's my threshold. After about a year I find myself getting tired of moving around all the time, packing and unpacking, and planning where to go next.  I start to miss my home office, which is set up with a large desk, ergonomic chair, dual 27"" monitors, gigabit internet, and some peace and quiet. I find that I'm much more productive working in a proper office compared to bouncing around coffee shops and coworking spaces on the road with a 13"" laptop, hoping for usable wifi. And while that classic photo of the laptop by the beach looks cool, anyone who's ever tried it knows it's not actually that practical.  I start to miss my home kitchen and cooking my own meals with my own knives, pans, and appliances. Rather than eating out all the time (in some places) or trying to make do with randomly stocked kitchens (usually with cheap stuff) in whatever AirBnb apartment I'm renting.  I start to miss my home gym, with my power rack, weights, and all of the gear I need to consistently work out the way I want. After a while you get tired of making do with whatever you can find on the road.  The first time I left I got rid of most of my stuff, and it was indeed nice to purge my possessions and live out of a single bag for a while. But lately I've found that I prefer getting high quality gear (/r/buyitforlife/), and keeping it in storage while I travel, knowing I'll be able to return to it when I come home.  My ultimate dream is similar to yours - owning houses/condos in a few different countries and having a nice office/kitchen set up in each one, perhaps renting them out while I'm not living there. Not sure how realistic this is though."

And it feels amazing, but at the same time I feel like I can now ""tick that off my list"" and start downsizing.  Our future plans are all up in the air though. I know for the foreseeable future we will own properties as part of our portfolio, and next time we head overseas storage will be part of the solution, but if we want to go full nomad I think we'll have to give most of it away. Double trouble is that my in-laws are likely to retire into a form of nomadism at some point, and I think they plan to store their stuff with us! Thanks for sharing your experiences."

It's part of the reason I've realized that long-term, no-end-in-sight traveling just isn't for me. I like having a a home -- even if it's just a very small space -- to come back to. I like having a closet to hang my clothes in. I like having some of my creature comforts waiting for me when I come back from a while on the road.  I'm also considering buying a place and renting it out on AirBnB when I'm gone. I think it's a very plausible plan -- just make sure you have all of your bases covered re: insurance and random things like cleaning. If you're gone for 4 or 6 months, LOTS of people will be in and out of your place via AirBnB in that time. You'd need a trusted cleaning service to come in between each guest.  And I would definitely have a small room or closet with a very sturdy lock on it in which to keep my personal items, sensitive documents, etc., while I'm away and renting the space out."

You may not cover the complete mortgage, but it is so much easier than dealing with AirBNB guests. Family or friends in need are people you should reach out to for this.

digitalnomad,37a48h,9to5traveler,1 point,Tue May 26 11:44:22 2015 UTC,"You can buy electronic locks that can be managed remotely, or have a friend/housekeeper on call who gets a fee to do key service or lockout service (built into a small deposit on the Airbnb rental).  If you're remote, you should have a housekeeper on call to clean between guests anyway."

digitalnomad,37a48h,bangsecks,2,Mon Jun 8 16:02:41 2015 UTC,My parents let me keep a few boxes in their basement and they also let me crash in the spare bedroom on the rare occasions that I come home. It's really an ideal arrangement in my mind and I'm thankful that my parents allow this.  A whole apartment sitting empty just sounds like a major waste of money and space to me. I'm not sure I understand the benefit you would gain over your current arrangement?
digitalnomad,37a48h,buxx,1 point,Tue May 26 13:28:23 2015 UTC,I sold of almost all my stuff and store the rest - which isn't much - at my father's house.
digitalnomad,37a48h,purplegoodance,1 point,Tue May 26 12:57:28 2015 UTC,"Primarily in a large backpack. The 5 boxes I couldn't get rid of (one is a box of family photos) is being stored by one of my ex's but I intend on having them shipped to my parents place. Realistically I could purge all but 2 boxes of them, and even then what would be left is stuff my parents gave me I couldn't bring to throw out."
digitalnomad,37a48h,fabe,1 point,Tue May 26 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"For everyone keeping boxes at a family member or friend's place consider my horror story: in my several years as an analog nomad I kept stuff at my father's place, who has two different properties, several acres each, more than one structure on one, so no dearth of space for him, and he's a cool guy, no animosity, but after years of being totally cool with me keeping like 5 or 6 boxes in the attic it all suddenly had to go, I wasn't able to come get it, and all that shit was trashed.  Some of it irreplaceable and of sentimental value.  If you can't do without it, I recommend just paying to store it somewhere because you never know when the person you're storing with will inexplicably want to free that space up and give you very little notice."

I know this is supposed to be facetious but I'd argue that you're correct.  For most people, you'll end up ""saving"" more money if you spend the time trying to increase your earnings instead of doing saving-related activities.  Spend a day reading a book on how to increase your freelance rate, for example, and you'll end up making more money over a month than you would save if you spent that entire day churning, couponing, and flight hacking.   Or just spend that time working instead.  e/ You can obviously do both, as well, if that's what you're into.  I'm just pointing out that active moneysaving techniques tend to not be at the top of the list -- their ROI is lower."
digitalnomad,37a0n2,noodlez,1 point,Tue May 26 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like it should be clarified that by earning more, you don't have to worry about ""spending less."" You still need to save money for retirement, no matter how much you earn. Making more is still a great strategy here, because you can save more easily.  I think it's terrible if someone comes along and simply reads, ""you don't have to worry about saving money."""
digitalnomad,37a0n2,alwaysonesmaller,2,Tue May 26 11:04:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's terrible when young people stress and worry too much about ""retirement"". We are leaving our homes, families, friends and travelling the world, living on a knife's edge, earning money, making stuff, getting work done, and really living life hard. When I die, people will say that I truly LIVED my life. A huge part of fully throwing yourself in to this lifestyle is in letting go of traditional social constructs like the pension. Paying a pension is essentially paying for retired people right now, with the expectation that in 45 years that young people will still pay into it for me. I choose to think that this is unlikely, and I will sort out my own retirement income, thanks. Earn, spend, whatever, but the key point, is to really live your life and not worry. If you worry enough, you won't even need much of a retirement pension anyways as you will worry yourself into the grave."
digitalnomad,37a0n2,Bog_warrior,6,Tue May 26 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"Sorting out your own retirement is the way to go, but the sooner you start the sooner you don't have to worry about it, so starting to save when you're young is exactly what you should do.  Starting to save when you're 25, even if it's a small amount, will have a much bigger impact than starting to save when you're 65 and your needs are different as are, perhaps, your abilities."

digitalnomad,37a0n2,ludysantana,3,Sat May 30 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"This will probably be a clichéd answer, but: spend most of your time in SE Asia.   For my girlfriend and I to live in Chiang Mai for six weeks — and we overspent on accommodations, it turned out — it was $1,600 total. Every penny we spent. For both of us.  There were no sacrifices in terms of lifestyle, either. We had a fair number of western-style meals, a gym membership, took a cooking class, went to the movies — as far as lifestyle went, it felt pretty glamorous.  I'm in Europe for the summer, but then we're headed back to SEA indefinitely. After a couple years, we'll theoretically be able to continue living in SEA off just the interest of what we'll save in just a couple years.   2 western incomes - <$20K annual expenses = 1 metric fuckton of savings"
digitalnomad,37a0n2,jlengstorf,5,Tue May 26 07:29:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, the same can be had for living domestically as well. If you live in the suburban or rural areas making a 'city' wage, you can definitely save a ton of money as the cost of living is usually 50-60% of a large city. Many people don't want to live in small town Idaho or the outskirts of Knoxville though. Chang Mai probably has the right mix of adventure and activities for you at this point in your life, but don't discount places domestically as well."
digitalnomad,37a0n2,tmarthal,1 point,Tue May 26 15:57:38 2015 UTC,I agree to a point. A lot of the U.S. is set up with very expensive utilities and other living expenses that pile up fast. Doing the tourist visa/short-term housing has eliminated a lot of those costs for me.   I do agree that there will come a point for me (probably) where this lifestyle seems less appealing. But I don't know that moving to the suburbs counts as a digital nomad money saving tip. :)
digitalnomad,37a0n2,jlengstorf,1 point,Tue May 26 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"So my girlfriend and I are considering start in SEA because of this comment. Right now we spend $1850 CAD on just rent.  I am curious what would $3000+ spent in a month actually be in Chiang Mai. If you were to actually set out and say we are going to spend 3000 per month, could you even do it?"
digitalnomad,37a0n2,inspireNomad,2,Thu May 28 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"You can always find ways to spend money if you try. But I think $3K/month would go pretty far for two people. Average meal for two of us was $4–10. You'll be fine on less, probably. Good luck!"
digitalnomad,37a0n2,jlengstorf,1 point,Thu May 28 21:27:11 2015 UTC,You probably could spend it. The Nimman district has several fashionable places that are priced to match. You'll feel like the 1% but it would probably be pretty awesome.

digitalnomad,377ulf,nomadrelocation,2,Mon May 25 19:55:58 2015 UTC,"hahaha, i hate this term so much...but i started using it just because it's how to find people who live a similar life as me. i'd love to use a better word."
digitalnomad,377ulf,DoctorSexy_MD,2,Tue May 26 00:42:57 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree. Apparently I was a ""digital nomad"" since 2005 without even knowing what the term meant (or that it existed) until last year. I think it's just human nature to want to identify with a tribe of some sort, and people gravitate to labels. For years I just said ""I work online"" and still do say that. I don't actually tell people I'm a ""digital nomad"". I can definitely tell when people are using it as a brag (most of the time). One good thing about the term is that it allows us to find related content on Google compared to not having any sort of common description or uniform term"
digitalnomad,377ulf,lefnire,2,Tue May 26 08:02:46 2015 UTC,"then don't use it. Whenever people ask me what I do I don't tell them, because what does it matter what I do? It isn't who I am. I am not a digital nomad, I'm not a remote worker, I'm not an entrepreneur, I'm not any of those things, I'm just me and I like what I like and that's who I am, not what I do."
digitalnomad,377ulf,DoctorSexy_MD,6,Tue May 26 11:56:28 2015 UTC,"So someone asks ""what do you for a living?"" you say ""I'm just me, and I like who I am""?

I'm a mechanical designer regardless of being in-house or freelance or travel while I'm freelance etc.   The nomad part describes a lifestyle, true, but it's sort of the minimum useful information that can answer that question and like you, I'd at least like to be useful in answering the real question which is trying to get a feel for who I am and what I enjoy, or at least what I do for money.

Only thing that comes to mind is that neither your phone or your pocket wifi is quad band, but then again it should have been if you bought the phone in New Zealand; the Vodaphone pocket wifi might be like a Telstra equivalent in Australia in that it's only provisioned for one or sometimes two bands that their network supports.  I theory, without checking the specs for either, they should work.  How long are you in Thailand for? Might just be easier to go buy a new phone and use it as your hotspot/wifi needs, but likewise where are you in Thailand that you don't have wifi?   I purchased a Samsung Galaxy A7 a couple of months back, 14,900 baht, and works fine as a hotspot on DTAC's 4G network in Chiang Mai (when I need it, 99% of the time I'm on my apartments Wifi.) You could easily buy Android phones for far less than that, that would work as a hotspot given that I can only presume you don't have Wifi where ever you are staying."

I just discovered a month ago how mind-blowingly beautiful Orofino, Idaho is (that whole west/central area of Idaho, in general). It was so beautiful, it actually kind of annoyed me, lol, because I started thinking, ""damn, nobody told me about this! Nobody! How could this be such a secret??"" It's great discovering that sort of thing. I try to look on google for different places but every official website that a city council sets up always makes their town look unappealing (""Come to our beautiful town, ____ville, we have...museums and... good schools and stuff, come on, lots of uh... stuff..."") hahaha.  Route 66 is fun, too :) Anyone considering that, I recommend it 100%.   but yes, like you said, suzhouCN, lots of charming places. that's what i'm fixing to find more of :) What are you some of your favorites?

digitalnomad,36tumh,suzhouCN,1 point,Fri May 22 02:27:16 2015 UTC,One thing that surprised me was how nice parts of Tennessee were. I was there on a business trip and found it nice and charming.

Not the best place imo to pitch up a tent or park an RV.  In fact that's probably somewhat true of anywhere in the US. RV (in safe areas) or pay out the ass in hotels (You might be breaking even with the price of safe hotels). Sad that a country as wealthy as the US has such high crime."

She's also 8 years old.  Anyway, I put out a request to all my friends to see if anyone wanted her. One of my friends, who has a large house, took her and now she gets to play outside and seems generally happier with life.  My first suggestion would be to look into local friends first, to see if anyone is interested. I also have a friend that worked at a pet shop with a cat rescue and that was my backup plan. I would check local cat rescues and not shelters, because the rescues will usually keep them until they can be re-homed.   I don't know where home is, but if it's near Portland, OR, I can get you the names of rescued that are reputable.   It's a frustrating situation, but you're trying to do the right thing!"
digitalnomad,36pnb8,dpash,2,Thu May 21 07:09:00 2015 UTC,My thought was offer the cat to friends or in a local listing.
digitalnomad,36pnb8,kristallnachte,1 point,Thu May 21 07:59:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks. I cant believe how similar our situations are... This gives me hope!  Ever since I went to an animal shelter in LA and saw how there were  4 buildings of young, healthy cats that were all going to be put down, I lost hope that anyone would ever want to adopt an 8 year old cat. Her temperament is quite good these days despite being timid, but her clawing is an issue I haven't been able to solve.  I will look into friends and then local rescues. It would be such a huge weight off my shoulders."

If you head to Nimman (just to the west of the old city), you'll feel more or less like you're living in any hipster Mecca: good (enough) coffee, western food, fully-equipped gyms, pools, clubs, etc..   You'll also find no-name restaurants where you can eat for $2 including drinks, and your rent will be $300–600/month for a place with air conditioning and wifi.   No issues with English. Just make a half-assed effort to learn to be polite in Thai (hello, yes, no, thank you) and you'll be fine."
digitalnomad,36nd4w,jlengstorf,11,Thu May 21 07:39:38 2015 UTC,"I choose to take on limited projects and live in cheap areas just so I can have my precious free time. I make around $2k a month not working very hard (maybe 20-30 hours a month) and spend about half that. I know many DMs are interested in living the high life in less expensive foreign countries, but I like living the simple life. I rent inexpensive apartments, cook my own food from the local markets, rarely eat out, take public transportation everywhere, live like the locals do wherever I am. I really enjoy this lifestyle, though I have found that it is not totally in line with what other DMs are looking to achieve.   Even when I was living in the US, I lived with multiple roommates, prepared all my own meals, and had minimal expenses. It's not because I had to, it's because I liked it this way. I've turned away from buying unnecessary things and filling my home with stuff, and moved towards filling my life with experiences and interesting people/connections."

digitalnomad,36nd4w,rucheleh06,7,Mon Jun 1 06:59:29 2015 UTC,"I won't go into how much I make, but I spend 30,000 thb a month in Chiang Mai, which thanks to the drop in the USD is now slightly under US$900. It leaves me significant savings, to the point I'm spending July in Japan then an island in Vietnam as my summer break, and I'm only touching on my savings.  In terms of lifestyle, I do not slum it at all.  My apartment in a serviced residence is roughly 10,000 baht (US$300) a month (depends on what the water and power bill comes in at, can be as much as 10,300) and that's an apartment with a western bathroom, decent sized fridge, microwave, cable, queen size bed,nice view, pool, gym, room service, weekly cleaning, cafe downstairs along with a bar come general store area, and a dead cheap laundry service.    I could easily spend half that amount in Chiang Mai elsewhere but I like my mod cons, and as you asked, it's about lifestyle: I like a little luxury in my life.   My monthly spend includes regular Western food (probably 30% of meals,) alcohol and more. I nearly always eat out although occasionally I'll pick up cheese and bread from Tops Supermarket and make a sandwich.   Unless you were nightclubbing regularly in Chiang Mai you're hard pressed to spend more than $1,000 a month.   I couldn't afford, on what I'm making, to live this lifestyle back in my native Australia in a million years.   I noticed someone else bagging Chiang Mai to you in another comment; it's not Bangkok, BKK is a huge city with everything that brings, positives and negatives. The Chiang Mai metro area has about 1 million people, it's dead easy to get around (you don't need public transport or even a bike, Songteaws are 20 baht, a tuk tuk will take you anywhere for 100 baht) and there's nothing you could lack from, 5 big malls complete with Western brands, every sort of Western food you could think of, nightlife, touristy things if you're into that, and just about everything is cheap.  On the numbers you're talking about salary wise you could live like a king, and still have change."

digitalnomad,36nd4w,jonez450reloaded,7,Thu May 21 12:01:58 2015 UTC,"Downsides?  Well, nothing money or what's available wise, well except cheese and wine are expensive, but that's a Thailand wide problem.  I'm not into nightclubs and while there is a nightclub area here, I'm told it's not brilliant.   Weather and environment at times, for example don't be here in March; this year burning season was said to be the worst in 10 years, a couple of days were like the apocalyptic pics you see out of China. This year is the last time I'll be in Chiang Mai in March, I'll probably spend next March in Krabi or maybe Vietnam.    The heat can get to you during April/ May the peak of hot season, but you do get use to it.   There are a ton of tourists around at certain times of year, Yi Peng/ Loi Krathong in November is crazy busy, as is Chinese new year with Chinese tourists, but that's all relative in Chiang Mai terms, to me somewhere like Bangkok is always crazy busy, and I live in a somewhat quieter area of Chiang Mai so unless you go to the busy areas you can avoid it.   There is a reason Chiang Mai has become a digital nomad hub, it's just such a cheap and easy place to live in, but still has mod cons and (this should be mentioned) is completely safe to live in as well, as in low crime, stumble back drunk at 1am you're not going to get mugged level safe.    I've got a friend who's try to convince me to visit him in the Philippines and yet I read his Facebook feed and he gets sick, or is pickpocketed, or worse again.   Thailand generally speaking, aside from the crazy drivers, is a really safe country, Chiang Mai is safer again.  Edit: I just remembered, if you're considering CM, read up on the Thai visa situation. That's a whole other long comment. It's doable once you work out how to work with the system, but it can seem a lot at first, such as for example me have to do border runs to Burma to get stamped in/ out every 3 months, or getting a 30 day extension every 60 days :)"

I have been living here for 5 years now and I am married with a chinese wife and son. we rent a 2 bedroom apartment with river and beach front views. We eat outside often, breakfast, lunch, dinner, or cook at home. We also do a lot of spending on nappies and miscellaneous items for our son.  Internet is fast but you do need a vpn to jump the GFW. Driving in traffic is challenging, more like playing pinball with cars and finding a parking space is a pain in the butt.   Weather is tropical all year round and there is minimal polution as we are so far south, compared to the mainland. Yes, you will need to learn Mandarin, as not many people speak English, but with no language skills you can still get by.  Monthly for a family of 2.5 we spend about $1000 usd per month. Add on another $300 usd per month which is to pay off my wifes cc bills. She looks after our son and loves buying junk from online shopping and I get to drink beer on street corners with locals, a fair trade off I reckon."

Further from the city center with less amenities you could easily find something for less than $300 USD especially if you want to sign a longer term lease.  The rest of my expenses add up to another $800 or so per month but I live like a king, eating out 3 times a day (Sometimes street food but sometimes nice restaurants as well), partying whenever I feel like it etc....  I make way way more than I could possibly ever spend here working about 20 hours per week as a consultant for tech companies, so the rest goes into savings/investments.

I could make more money in 3-5 months than I would working on small gigs for a year. Then could just have 7-9 months off, building up a business / client-lists / seeking new employers for remote.

digitalnomad,36nd4w,MRomeo99,1 point,Thu May 21 01:34:58 2015 UTC,"At some point there is going to be a tradeoff regarding cost of living. The basic rule is that you can live for very cheap in developing countries. The cost of living goes up in correlation with the standard of living in said country. The countries with the highest standard of living are usually the most expensive to live in (ie: Sweden, Denmark, etc).   I've lived in all types of countries and living conditions over the past 10 years ""nomading"", from remote northern Nicaragua to a highrise condo in downtown Vancouver to a loft in Amsterdam. You basically get what you pay for and the beauty of it is you don't have to commit to any one lifestyle. You can challenge yourself to live on <$1k/month in Tijuana one year then move to Singapore or London the next and live it up. If you are making $5k/month, you don't have to spend it all unless you want to.   Change it up every now and then and figure out which lifestyle suits you. After a year with dirt roads, empty surf and cows as neighbors in Nica I moved to a swanky city suburb in Costa Rica where there were paved roads and cappuccino machines. I was happy there for a couple years, then went to Mexico, the Caribbean, Canada, then Europe and now Asia in the years following. The benefit of this lifestyle is you can have any lifestyle you want and change it up as often as you want! If you love and miss a certain place, go back when that time comes.  You WILL find yourself forming new comfort zones really quickly and not wanting to leave a place after a few months, so just keep that in mind (it's subconscious or human programming).   1 thing I miss about low cost of living countries is having a full time maid and all the cheap related services: assistants, chefs, massages, etc. But sometimes I also need a dose of 1st world city living to even it out and keep the perspective."

digitalnomad,36nd4w,sobri909,-16,Mon Jun 1 20:23:44 2015 UTC,"No offense man, but do your own research. It's not like that information is hard to find. Long story short, it would be very difficult to spend that kind of money in a place like Chiang Mai. If you're making $3-5,000 a month, you can live almost anywhere, eat out every meal, drink a six pack a night, go on adventures, basically do anything you want without restrictions and still have a few thousand left over at the end of the month.   Look at nomadlist.com, numbeo, look for blog posts like ""cost of living in xxx"". The google search ""cost of living in Chiang Mai"" gives back 24,000 results. What aren't you finding that you're specifically worried about."
digitalnomad,36nd4w,sobri909,24,Wed May 20 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, stop asking questions about the digital nomad lifestyle in the Digital Nomad subreddit, this is obviously not the right place for that."
digitalnomad,36nd4w,Purpledrank,7,Wed May 20 19:54:47 2015 UTC,"There's nothing I'm worried about, I've looked at all those places, and while they give an accurate idea of what things cost, they don't actually reflect lifestyle.  The kind of questions you'd be looking for I guess are: - Is it cosmopolitan?    Are there lots of high quality places to eat?  Is it easy to get by speaking English?  By the sounds of it as a young person earning a decent salary you'd be able to go crazy, but I haven't heard anyone mention how they're living this amazing crazy lifestyle because of the strength of the currency they're earning in. What is the standard of accomodation like at that salary range? Am I gonna be in a nice flat, or would it be an amazing flat with a view, etc? Are there any major things that I'm going to be missing out on? Examples of this would be stuff like public transport being a nightmare.   Is that a better way to frame it?"
digitalnomad,36nd4w,whatwouldreddittdo,8,Wed May 20 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"Is it cosmopolitan?   Some cities in SEA are: Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok. You'll probably be wanting to look at the bigger cities. But even Chiang Mai has a decent modern mall. The great thing about SEA is you don't have to decide now. You can try all of them out for three months and it won't cost you very much at all.  Get an Air Asia pass base yourself from Kuala Lumpur and you can fly throughout SEA very cheaply. https://www.staralliance.com/en/fares/airpasses/asia-airpass# http://www.airasia.com/ot/en/book-with-us/asean-pass.page   Are there lots of high quality places to eat?   This is a little different than what you're probably used to, if you haven't been to SEA before. It really depends on what you consider high quality. If you're talking white linen service, in places like Chiang Mai you can find those in hotels and the like. However, what's different from a place like Chiang Mai to Paris is there isn't a great amount of difference in the every day food versus the high end food. While in Paris you might eat street food which really isn't in anyway similar to what you'll find in the 3* joints, in SEA there isn't as huge of a difference. And it's all pretty savory food. The difference is here for $1.50-$2.50 you can get an amazing meal from a street vendor, that is cheap and so tasty. Versus spending $40-50 in a hotel restaurant. Even the mid-tier restaurants you can find meals for $3-5 that are quite good. I personally love all SEA cuisines and find them quite tasty at any price, and don't see a wide disparity in enjoyment or taste between the high end hotel restaurant and the better street vendors. You definitely can't say that about Paris.     By the sounds of it as a young person earning a decent salary you'd be able to go crazy, but I haven't heard anyone mention how they're living this amazing crazy lifestyle because of the strength of the currency they're earning in.   Well everyone lives their own lifestyle, but it can be quite different living in SEA. The fact that you're not spending 10 hours a week sitting in traffic or commuting, means you get 10 hours of your life back. Is that enough to make a difference in an amazing lifestyle? For some it is. One of the biggest differences in the lifestyle is the fact that within reason you can do pretty much whatever you want. For instance living in London, if you wanted to go spend a weekend with your girlfriend in Paris, what would you have to budget for that? £500? But it's quite easy let's say to decide to spend 3-4 days on a beach in Southern Thailand and your total would be maybe £150- that's transportation, housing, food, etc. There are other aspects of the lifestyle that are great. You really never have to cook again, it's actually cheaper to eat street food than it is to cook, and unless you're an amazing cook- it's going to be better anyway. You can have a maid that comes 2x a week for a very low salary that does all of your cleaning and does your laundry, etc. If you like an occasional pint, and don't mind drinking the local brews(which aren't horrible), you can drink pints for less than £1 in most bars. Guinness however will set you back around £4-5. You can go to a high-end bar in Bangkok and the like and get a few bottles(whiskey, rum, vodka) with some friends, have a great time, and only be down maybe £100-150.   What is the standard of accomodation like at that salary range? Am I gonna be in a nice flat, or would it be an amazing flat with a view, etc?   There are some really good websites to look at stuff while you're home, although mostly you'd be better off coming and finding something in an area you like on your own. You'll pay 10-50% higher from a website than you would finding it while you're here. Here's an example of a decent flat:  http://www.chiangmaihouse.com/p2171-Condominium-for-rent-located-on-Chang-Klan-Rd-.html  £344 a month. Although you can obviously go cheaper, and a little more high end. You can find pretty nice studio apartments for £100-125 pretty easily.    Are there any major things that I'm going to be missing out on? Examples of this would be stuff like public transport being a nightmare.   Sure, I mean let's not sugarcoat it, this is a third world country you're considering moving to. You'll always be an outsider, and that can be tough, it's fairly hard to have meaningful friendships with locals. If you're staying long term, it's tough as people come and go. Public transport can be iffy for sure. But if you live in the right place, you don't really need any public transportation, you can walk to about anything you need. If you want food from home, you'll pay through the nose for it, 3-5x what you'd pay for local fare. Being away from family and friends can be tough. For some it can be very lonely. Not being able to just find anything I want on Amazon and have it delivered in two days is hard.   The long and short of it again is, if you make Western Style money your lifestyle can be 2-3x better than it would be at home AND you can still sock money away. If I chose to work full-time remotely at my old Western salary in a place like Chiang Mai, I couldn't come close to spending my full salary unless I lived in a high-end hotel and ate there every single meal. But it's more about the freedom of being able to do about anything I want, and not have to worry about not having enough money at the end of the month.   Hope this helps. Sorry for the snippy response yesterday, was having a bad day."

I know it's the place that all digital nomads talk about, but honestly you'll have a better lifestyle in Bangkok. And the income you're on will go reasonably far in Bangkok. I think part of the draw of Chiang Mai is it's cheaper. But with your income you can afford Bangkok.  For your money you could be living in a reasonable business traveller grade serviced apartment instead of one of the low end ones that most digital nomads seem to gravitate to.   Edit: I'd answer your individual questions, but I've never lived long in Chiang Mai, only visited. If you want to know the answers for Bangkok, I can provide those."
digitalnomad,36nd4w,Purpledrank,2,Thu May 21 01:40:46 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear that stuff about Bangkok as well if you have time. I'm not really biased, I'd just heard Chiang Mai thrown around a lot and my flatmate says it's her 2nd favourite place in the world after Pai hah."
digitalnomad,36nd4w,whatwouldreddittdo,1 point,Thu May 21 05:25:55 2015 UTC,"Depends if you like big cities or small towns. Chiang Mai is small town, Bangkok is big city. There's plenty going on in Chiang Mai, but it lacks decent public transport, and doesn't have much in the way of big city excitement. It's certainly not my scene - I'm a big city guy.  I think the reason why people favour Chiang Mai is you can live there comfortably while doing casual part time contract work. It's cheap, it's fun, the people are nice, etc, etc.  But if you're earning good money, and want a bit more going on, then Bangkok's the place. At least to my mind."

Let yourself get used to the new income level before you go blowing all of your increased income.  Now, that said, $70k is a good salary in Atlanta. It's a mediocre salary in NYC.   WolframAlpha says that a $70,000 lifestyle in Atlanta is equivalent to a $149,000 lifestyle in NYC. That's pretty accurate to me, having lived close to NYC and now being in North Carolina."
digitalnomad,36o9fs,alwaysonesmaller,1 point,Wed May 20 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely consider delaying any moves for a few more months. Even if the current job appears secure, anything that would be expensive to reverse out of, should a new job search be required, should be delayed until you have savings that could cover such an event.  That said, as long as time-zone differences are non-issues or can be managed by shifting working hours, do consider living abroad in less expensive places that still would provide a high quality of life (savings is greater). There are a slew of places, and for time-zone consider Central/South America."

Could have moved to NYC or Boston for almost four times my previous salary, but I settled for ""just"" doubling my salary and working remotely. In the end, the effective income vs. cost of living balanced out (before you even consider the other inherent benefits of living outside a metropolis). Glad that my experience could shed some light on your situation. :)  On a side note: if you like cities in the South but not Atlanta in particular, visit Charlotte some time. It's a nice city with all the amenities, a major airport hub, but not as much congestion as Atlanta (in my experience visiting both)."

digitalnomad,36o9fs,SteveRD1,1 point,Wed May 20 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"One thing I'm afraid of is that my new job won't like it if I suddenly switch time zones. Most people I work with are in EST/EDT, although there are a couple people in Australia and one in Europe.   Another thing is that I've been to SEA and my ideal place would be Mainland China, however the internet has not been reliable enough in the places I've been.   I often Skype (sometimes 5-10 times a day) with team members, and if I'm cut out of that, it would be bad for my job. From my experience in hotels in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, the internet would have to be reliable enough where I wouldn't get clients pissed off. Mainland is completely out of the picture right now just because of the censoring issues (foreign websites purposefully slowed down)."

China has recently (last 4-5 months) started cracking down on VPNs. You would have been ok on internet before then, but now even premium VPNs are having issues. I used VYPR, which worked flawlessly until the crackdown and started to have issues that would make remote office type work impossible, especially skype.   Second, China time is appx 12 hour difference from US time zones depending on season. Not great if you need to do live work.   I'm usually a proponent of China as an underrated destination for Western travelers, but not in your case."

I was briefly looking at HK (if I could bargain with my company to work China hours, since we have a couple of staff in Perth, Australia), but HK seems expensive to live in.

Then I found out about DN stuff and thought this is what I want, this is for me, but I would also like to be able to go back into the regular settled life later if I want.

digitalnomad,36n96i,bangsecks,3,Sun May 24 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"Telecommuting your job is drastically different between companies.  There's a lot of companies out there that hire cross-state and such to find talent and allow them.  Then there's the other side of the coin where the company I work for will look cross-state to hire, but require they uproot and move to where the company is as programmers need to be on-site.  Your best option is to talk to HR and your boss and see what options, if any, you have.  If you're not in a position to do this, then there's either just sucking it up and doing what you're doing or looking for a company who does allow remote work."

My plan was to get some sort of 9-5 to tide me over whilst I build skills and passive income sources in my free time. I had read that if you work really hard at building a skill and portfolio up using something like ruby you can get freelance work on odesk within a year. How true that is I can't say, and it requires a lot of dedicated work. One of the problems I have is that I can't actually picture what a freelance programmer actually does yet but as I learn the languages I'm sure I'll start to get an idea. But once you've built up some clients you essentially telecommuting for yourself.  What I'm trying to say is that it seems possible to get to the point where you can go location independent in a shorter time frame than 10 years, but that's down to your hard work. I'm sure others will have plenty more to add as I'm just some guy who's not actually done it yet.  Sorry for rambling. Good luck with whatever you decide to do."
digitalnomad,36n96i,buzziebee,2,Sun May 24 18:22:31 2015 UTC,This is bullshit. I got a full time remote job quite easily with 3 years experience.
digitalnomad,36n96i,9to5traveler,1 point,Sun May 24 18:31:24 2015 UTC,"I would argue that for many programmers, they need a decade of experience before they can be relied on to write good maintainable code. For those developers, they learn the skills they need to be on their own through asking questions of co-workers, peer-review and other stuff that's just easier to do in person.   So, for an average programmer for a typical company code development position, I think a decade of programming could be about right.   But a good chunk of programmers are above average and for those programmers the option to work remotely can come much earlier. There are also many atypical programming positions out there that could enable remote work for those who want to do it"
digitalnomad,36n96i,stuporglue,1 point,Wed May 20 21:24:48 2015 UTC,"Remote jobs in programming are simply much more difficult to get than non-remote ones. The good thing is, they usually pay more and companies who offer remote have more modern values in general.  Just work really hard at mastering a remote-friendly skillset, work for interesting companies and products and once you have done that and you have a few years of experience (3-10) you can start applying for remote jobs. Don't just apply for two weeks and give up, apply consistently for months or even years (while still working) and eventually you'll get something. From there it gets easier."

There is always a demand for developers which makes it hard for startups to locate good talent which is why they don't mind hiring remote. However the key is you have to have the skill.  The thing is once you get to the point that companies would be willing to hire you and let you work remotely you are probably good enough to come up with a SaaS you can charge for. It's like the girl becoming interested in you the moment you become disinterested. I am in a place now where I can get pretty much any remote job but I don't need them because I have my own revenue stream."

digitalnomad,36n96i,proxwell,1 point,Thu May 21 19:17:55 2015 UTC,"The answer is not to follow a career path but to create one. You could get someone to hire you for a freelance project right now more than likely if you were willing to work for cheap enough.   There are two paths that I see, but there are probably more.   Work somewhere long enough to get a good enough skillset to go freelance or get a remote job. Be willing to work for free/cheap and slowly build your freelance/remote job up to a respectable level.   I'm not sure which route is faster/better, but I am taking the second because I am almost certain that it is faster; and I see it as having the best potential upside. I do digital marketing, and after 1 year and a lot of living very cheaply I am now starting to get my sea legs and starting to think about travel etc. That said I am still not making a ton of money, but that doesn't matter to me as much as freedom of location and those sorts of things.   One option that was not very obvious to me, at least in my industry, is the possibility to do contract work for agencies and companies that basically guarantee a certain amount of weekly work. This can be a godsend as a new freelancer if you can land that.  Obviously this is all just first level stuff. The real mastery comes in creating automated companies that can make you money without you needing to sell time, but I see that as the next career move after this one. Just something for you to consider."

Seems rather counterproductive to me. I saw your Canadian, if you're going to be working as an auditor I'm going to assume you're on the CA track of the program. There's also the fact that once you have it, you need to pay your annual dues (I know it's over $1000, it's been a bit since I looked at getting mine though), plus continuing education credit hours. For all the effort and money you're putting in I would look at ways on how to leverage your CPA into location independent work.   If you like tax, setup a tax practice doing returns for expats and Canadian digital nomads. With most returns being electronically submitted to CRA these days all you really need is a place in Canada to safely store hard copies of your clients files.   You could also provide consulting via a freelancing website like UpWork (formerly Odesk). Run an online bookkeeping service, provide tax advice, etc.   More and more professionals are finding ways to go location-indepdent (i.e lawyers http://www.legalnomads.com/2013/03/location-independent-lawyer.html). Do some research. It's totally possible. Good luck!"

You only need one job, so going strictly by the number of available positions for a particular technology isn't that helpful.   On the other hand, even though developers are currently very much in demand all over the world, I'd say there are still quite a few more developers looking for remote work than there are remote positions, which reduces your leverage significantly.   So whatever you do (Python/Django and even Flask seem perfectly reasonable to me), focus more on building your portfolio and getting some experience - it's better to be an expert in Python and Flask than intermediate developer in Rails, and you'll get there faster since you're not starting from zero.  Also, try to figure out what interests you, it will make things easier in the long run."

Obviously things can change in the future, but if you want a starting point to focusing your learning, I think this is the list to follow. Hope this help!"

But Django does come up here and there, so there's no harm in learning if you have time :)"

digitalnomad,36nfrk,Jobspresso,1 point,Wed May 20 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, it seems like you have some knowledge of remote jobs.  I am about to graduate with a degree in finance and am doing some research on wondering what my options are.  I was hoping you could tell me if there is any way to get a remote job in this field, right out of college... or if there's anything I can possibly do with this degree."
digitalnomad,36p07e,drubus,6,Thu May 21 00:03:37 2015 UTC,"My advice, would be to try each of the professions you listed as a small side project to see if you enjoy it. When you find one that keeps you interested, stay on that path and start looking into translating it into remote work. The side project doesn't need to be lucrative, but just something you work on in your spare time.  For example, I do freelance writing, but am curious about UX/UI so I decided to redo my site from scratch to better understand the process."
digitalnomad,36p07e,MMorby,2,Thu May 21 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"The great thing is you have a lot of time to develop and hone not just one, but several skills! Try going with what excites you most, especially because it sounds like even after you retire, you should be able to afford a nomadic lifestyle with just your pension (it can be cheaper than you think).   As a disclaimer - I'm a programmer and I'm working on an app development course - but you mentioned you already programmed before. Is that something you think you'd enjoy pursuing? With the time you have on your hands, you can get back up to speed, make several attempts at building you own business on the side, and in the end even if it doesn't work out you'll have built skills and portfolio to do contract/freelance work afterwards.   Compared to the other areas you mentioned, like writing or creating videos, I think programming can give you more leverage and a much higher chance for success, simply because the demand is much higher (and will likely continue to be once you're done with your job). It's not that writing is easy, or that you can't earn enough doing it, but it's harder to stand out (and you have to). It's like being an actor vs. being a doctor -- everybody wants to be the former, but very few ever succeed in that career. Ones that do enjoy immense success, but they are 1 in 10000. On the other hand, I haven't heard of 'starving doctors', compared to so many 'starving artists' :)  But again, you have a lot of time on your hands, try everything that interests you and see what works best.  Good luck!"

It can often be exhausting sightseeing all day then working 8 hours at night, but its a pretty good life, the perks make up for it.

But it took me 3 years to be in a place where I could make a consistent paycheck and be remote, it sounds like it's already pretty damn feasible for you!  1: I know Charles Schwab has accounts with no international transaction/withdrawal fees. I haven't set up an account with them yet but my roommate (who is also disappearing into the aether with me) has and has nothing but good things to say about them. I guess you can take money out anywhere without being charged for it with them.  2: I'm planning on Airbnb most of the time, and I'm planning on staying in countries/cities by the month to maximize the bang for my buck.

AirBNB is probably the most common answer, but this also depends on the location. In general, stays within a month to 90 days should cost less compared to daily/weekly rates.

I also get a gym membership (most places have a punch card for 10 or so entries at between $5–15/visit) and go twice a week. I pay a personal trainer $100 for a 6-week program (so about $67/month) so I have someone keeping me on track and measuring progress.   I have been eating whatever I want, but I'm still losing weight while I'm here (down 5kg since December). I attribute that to the smaller portion sizes outside the U.S. and the fact I'm getting about 3–4x the walking in each week.   One thing I miss, and that I keep meaning to seek out, is play: pick-up basketball, touch football, ultimate frisbee — the kind of stuff that doesn't feel like working out.

Our focus is quality, not quantity. To achieve this, we spend the time to make sure every remote job is legitimate and open by reviewing the employer’s website, career page, social media accounts and general reputation, so that you see only the highest quality jobs. We take care of the legwork so you don't have to.  So to answer your original question: Having done this for a while, I can say that there are TONS of fishy/scammy remote job boards and listings out there. But you won't find them on our site. We hope people find their ideal remote jobs through us."

Penang is a fun place with great food, beaches aren't amazing but there are some. Langkawi has a huge and gorgeous main beach (though apparently in-season it can be full of noisy jetskiers - it was entirely quiet when we were there). We both really liked Malaysia.  We also went to Phuket, to Rawai, and that was lovely but quiet, and the food wasn't amazing (perhaps we were unlucky)."

IF you rent a stand-alone house and travel, you run a fair risk of your house being broken into. I never planned on renting a home, so I kind of put it out of my mind. There are tons of super cheap 3BR apartments with 24 hour security and all the amenities.   As far as all the other nasty stuff, rape, murder, muggings.

I went there in May last year and it was pretty dead - this time of year is off season.  The main beach aims to be a tourist destination, but it does it pretty badly. It only really caters to local tourists, but they are starting development of a few new resorts. It's a bit pricier than other parts of Malaysia, but still a lot cheaper than Bali.  Hire a car and go explore the island if even that is too much - there are nice beaches in the north, that you will have to yourself."

All three have highlands in the middle with a Pacific Coast to the West and a Caribbean Coast to the East. Panama and Costa Rica have comparable crime, Nicaragua has relatively little.

digitalnomad,35xihd,lefnire,7,Thu May 14 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"I went the route of the freelance visa through Berlin, did it at the end of last year. It sounds like I'm actually in a fairly similar situation as you (freelancer but also a part time employee of a U.S. based company). Send me a PM and I'd be happy to answer any questions."
digitalnomad,35xihd,dmkmedina,5,Thu May 14 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"Aw, no pm - I wanna know too :) So you got a freelancer visa for Germany, and that visa was applicable for the entire Schengen Zone? Could you travel to other countries while on the Germany visa? Could you live in another Shengan country? By ""live"", I guess I mean an apartment lease. How long does the visa last? What kinda of qualifications did you have to meet as a freelancer?  Edit: Just re-read you're a US employee, so may not know re: last Q. Leaving there in case someone else knows."
digitalnomad,35xihd,lefnire,3,Thu May 14 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"Yah, so I got the German Freelance visa at the end of last year. It is a residence/work permit for Germany. It also serves as a schengen visa, so you can freely travel around during the duration of the permit (2 years in my case). It does NOT allow you to live in other countries though. Although, no one would really know if you weren't in Germany. As for getting a lease in another country, you wouldn't be able to get anything legitimate since you don't actually have a valid permit to live in other countries.  I actually am a freelancer, its just that one of my clients hired me on as a part time employee because it made the relationship easier for them. I still have freelance clients as well.  You can see all of my qualifications here: http://dmkmedina.com  Definitely let me know if you have any questions about the process that I can help you out with."

digitalnomad,35xihd,tuanomsok,1 point,Thu May 14 22:36:00 2015 UTC,That's my understanding. But you can't then go back to France. You'd need to be out for 90 days. UK or Ireland would be options. Or eastern Europe.

digitalnomad,35xihd,Bob_The_Cobb,2,Fri May 15 06:41:02 2015 UTC,"OP, I hope you don't mind if I use your thread to ask a related question about my situation.  I'm also an American who works remotely for an American company and is hoping to spend more than 90 days in the Schengen zone. I actually have permanent residency in a Schengen zone country after moving and living abroad for 2+ years (for a relationship, not work or studies). Residency is different than citizenship, though, and it doesn't grant me the right to live and work in other Schengen zone countries.   Would it not be easy, though, for me to stay elsewhere in the Schegnen zone and just claim that I've been living in the country I have residency in? If my passport doesn't even get stamped when I travel to other countries here, how would anyone prove that I've been outside of the country for more than 90 days?"
digitalnomad,35xihd,9to5traveler,2,Sun May 17 10:29:54 2015 UTC,"The UK will allow you to stay for 90 days as they are not part of the Schengen agreement.  Another option to look into is whether you are eligible for citizenship by descent in any European country. For many countries if you have a parent or sometimes a grandparent from the country you can apply for citizenship based on that.  My mom is from the UK but grew up in the States for most of her life. I was surprised to learn that this entitles me to a UK passport. I'm also eligible for Italian citizenship on my Dads side, so it's worth looking into if you have any European ancestry."

digitalnomad,35xihd,tuanomsok,3,Fri May 15 09:27:12 2015 UTC,Whether they stamp your passport or not is moot; they don't look for stamps.  Your passport is electronically scanned when you enter and leave the Schengen zone.  That's what they look for.
digitalnomad,35xihd,RobbieAnalog,3,Thu May 14 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"You can't spend just a week outside. For every 90 days you spend in, you have to spend 90 days out."

digitalnomad,35xihd,theparachutingparrot,1 point,Thu May 14 13:07:23 2015 UTC,"Easiest option:  Apply for a ""long stay visa type D"" for France, Italy, Malta or Spain.  I've had success with France.  As long as you can prove you will be earning more than 20,000 euros a year, and can supply bank statements, you should be able to get a renewable 1-year visa.  It's better than going the DAFT (Netherlands) route because you don't need to have 6,000 euros upfront.  By the way, if your parents are from a Latin American country, and you qualify for citizenship by ancestry in a Latin American country, you could get Spanish citizenship in 2 years if you get residency in Spain."

digitalnomad,35xdcv,ludysantana,1 point,Thu May 14 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"This is what I usually do (or did, when I actually had options hehe).  I'd get the password and run a speed test on my phone. If good, I'd buy something, if not, I'd just say thanks + apology and leave – the next cafe would only be 100m away anyway.  Now I work from a coworking space most days just because I have access to it.  Another option is getting a Regus card – I work mostly from their offices when I'm in my hometown. It's a totally different vibe though, very corporate, but has saved me many times when I was in a country for a really short amount of time, didn't really speak the local language, or didn't want so buy really unhealthy stuff at a cafe."
digitalnomad,35xdcv,x3nomik,5,Thu May 14 10:16:17 2015 UTC,This is yet another reason I spend most of my time in Taiwan: wifi speeds in most cafes are quite good and 99% of the time the password is their phone number.

I'm in the mainland and Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Caffe Benne, etc. all have this sign-in, ""20 minutes free"" bullshit that I'm pretty sure is useful to exactly nobody.  On the other hand, regular cafes are just really hit and miss, and it seems to fluctuate throughout the day. I'll be working along, merry as a lamb, and then KASPLOOSH! Can't load a thing.  Tangent: I'd also like to know how people troubleshoot their connections... I know the basic stuff like ""did you turn it off then on again? With VPN and without?

digitalnomad,35ucbe,bidzini,10,Wed May 13 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"Yo!  29F here.  I'm currently in Carrboro, NC, but lived in Antigua Guatemala for a little over a month earlier this year as a trial run, and am starting my ""official"" travel lifestyle there this fall.  I fell in love with the nomadic life when I was 20, on a school trip to Ireland.  When the rest of my classmates left, I stuck around for another couple of weeks, just winging it.  When I was 26, I headed back there, this time for the whole summer, with one 18L daypack and very little plan at all (but a subscription to WWOOF Ireland).  After getting back stateside, I tried to sate my wanderlust by road-tripping as much as I could, which worked to some extent.  Then last year I stumbled into editing, in which I find more passion than any other job I've ever done - and there's also the upside that it's almost always online/remote by default.  This summer, I'm getting rid of the last small amount of unnecessary possessions and finding a long-term pet-sitter for my cats, and then it's up stakes and go!  I'd say it was the trip to Guatemala that let me know how honestly feasible it was to work online and travel full-time, if I planned it correctly, instead of just taking breaks from work to travel.    Edit: I'll add that I have never had any trouble finding quick stopgap gigs in hostels, cafes, and the like, should the stream of editing gigs lapse a bit."
digitalnomad,35ucbe,nebtlly,4,Wed May 13 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing :) Your story sounds kind of similar to mine, except that I haven't been able to really find any writing/editing gigs since I quit my last job a few months ago. I'm working on a personal project right now, but don't have any income from it currently.  I'm curious, if you don't mind sharing, how do you get your editing gigs? I love to edit and write, and my last job was mostly writing for the web (with a bunch of other communications type stuff mixed in), but I've had really no luck in applying for gigs."
digitalnomad,35ucbe,thriftygal,4,Wed May 13 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"Well...I'm lucky.

digitalnomad,35ucbe,nebtlly,10,Thu May 14 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm (30/F) a freelance writer/editor. I've been working freelance (and traveling) for 18 months now. I moved to a freelance position by way of a very stable contract with a previous employer -- this helped give me confidence in making the transition since I was nervous about not having a steady, reliable source of income.  It's been fun. I've traveled a lot, had some great experiences, and met a lot of people. I've enjoyed the ""nomadic life,"" but now I'm actually looking for at least a part-time home. What I want out of life has changed a bit since I first started traveling a lot."

For me, it's mostly about building lasting relationships. I travel solo, and while that's fun and leads to awesome opportunities and experiences, I'm often lonely. Flings with random French guys you meet in Morocco are fun, but then everybody leaves or goes home, and what are you left with?  I've realized that I'm at the point in my life where I want to build a life with someone else, and that's tough to do if you're moving around every couple of months.  I don't want to stop traveling. But I do want to create a slightly more stable life and home from which to start those travels.  P.S. - After visiting Lisbon last year, it rocketed up to the top of my favorite cities in Europe! Is it one of your part-time homes? If so, awesome choice!"

Have only started doing work while holidaying but would love to take off when I finish my degree. It's in Creative Arts so I'm hoping to combine that with travel too and use my editing work as a baseline fund to get me by. I hooked up with a web designer who provided the work for me as I sometimes specialise in marketing so when I'm looking for work I think about who I want to target (author/business etc) and who they might be in touch with. But I have a friend who goes straight to the source and basically emails them saying ""your website is crap because x y z, here's what I can do for you and this is how much I can do it for."" Pretty aggressive and perhaps unorthodox but she does great work and makes a killing. Hope it goes well for you! I'm new to this sub so nice to meet you all!"
digitalnomad,35ucbe,atwa_au,3,Thu May 14 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm 28F, and just started doing the digital nomad thing in January of this year. I'm also traveling with my bf. I decided at the beginning of last year that I didn't want to work in my corporate job anymore, and was going to quit at the end of the year. However, my company ended up shutting down the office I was working in, so I got laid off and paid to go. It was really pretty great in the end!  Anyway, I thought I would take a limited time to travel and relax because I was burned out. But, as we've been doing this I can definitely see us continuing to travel.   As for work, a couple months in I got bored so I've started doing freelance writing and editing, and am learning UX design.   I think the hardest issues I've faced are keeping my confidence up since I'm new to freelancing, and making sure that I have a reliable connection.   Basically problems are few and far between. I've loved traveling so far and am feeling more fulfilled about my work in the past few months than I ever have! It's been great!"
digitalnomad,35ucbe,MMorby,5,Thu May 14 09:01:45 2015 UTC,"28 year old solo web designer been living on the road for about 2 years now. It started when I had a meltdown from working 80 hours a week. I decided to say fuck everything and finally do the backpacking i dreamed of. I moved my shit home, broke up with my boyfriend and just took off to japan, which ended up leading to Thailand, then Australia... I didnt exactly handle things the best way (I basically dropped off the face of the planet to all my loved ones) but it allowed me to disconnect and reconnect to my new life in a way that was vital. I've changed and grown so much as a person over these last 2 years.  Nowadays I alternate between home and abroad, a few months in each.   The first year I barely worked at all and lived off savings and that was amazing... Now I work too much and barely see the places I'm at. I'm still trying to find my balance but I feel like I'm finally getting into the swing of things. I stay in one place minimum of a month. Right now I'm in Greece for a month, rented an island apartment off Airbnb for $500 a month. There are pros and cons of this -- feeling like I have a stable ""home"" is comforting, the internet is reliable, and I can work without distractions. However, if you stay in hostels, that is when you have the best experiences because you meet soo many awesome people. However, the internet is always shit.   Biggest struggles are bad wifi, troubles making client phone calls, and actually getting work done when I just want to play all day. But after 2 years I'm positive now that there is no other life I'll ever want to live.   I also honestly didn't know anyone else was living this lifestyle (I've never met anyone else) until about a week ago when I found this sub. I was so freaking happy because now I know it's sustainable."

We both clicked with it immediately -- we're both travel bugs and felt that life was too cruelly short to fit in all the places we wanted to go with the traditional job setting. Wide-eyed and incredulous, we made the decision on the spot and over the next couple of weeks, figured out how we would make it happen. So, see you on the road ;)"

I'm an introvert and sometimes have a hard time going out and meeting new people. And sometimes I miss the office environment I had in San Francisco, where I could have breakfast and play ping pong with coworkers. I think I'd like to check out some of those all-inclusive remote startup incubator things where you can socialize with other entrepreneurs, but they tend to be quite expensive, and only for a couple of weeks at a time.  We take things slowly though. I don't think I could handle jumping between countries every 2 weeks, unless we were taking a vacation. While I'm working full-time on a startup and part-time with consulting, I definitely prefer to spend 2-6 months in one place so I can get into a routine. Even having to leave Thailand every 30 days is a bit of a pain."

I personally use azure because they have an integration directly with visual studio. Rackspace also has a share hosting solution which is decent too if you have a lot of websites. If you are linux only you can use linode.  If you are just setting up wordpress sites all of that might be over kill, you could use like wpengine, wordpress.com, or even a provider like godaddy."

digitalnomad,35s5hr,cheriot,1 point,Wed May 13 11:58:34 2015 UTC,If you're doing .net development I would say go with azure hands down. Publishing directly to azure is pretty convenient. One of the things I like is the ability to make staging slots. You can deploy to one and then when you are ready swap them. My business partner which does most of our sysadmin work set up a pretty sophisticated system that plugs directly in with github. You can setup azure to auto deploy from github repositories.  Both AWS and Azure have pay as you go models so you can mess around with both.
digitalnomad,35s5hr,cheriot,1 point,Thu May 14 07:18:26 2015 UTC,I might toy around w/ Azure.  I was considering doing a .NET service but I'm not skilled enough in the language yet and have some mental issues with how they handle things.  But it seems that the two top players in this area is AWS and Azure.  How does having Azure interact with being a digital nomad?

I store these in Google Drive. For the remaining items, I labeled boxes with a code and then logged them into a spreadsheet in Google Drive. Part of me feels like it was a ton of work and I wasted too much time getting that detailed, but on the other hand it has made it very easy to find an item.. all I would need to do is CTRL+F my spreadsheet and find the box number. I had too many small items falling in too many different categories to simply label the box, and I have several boxes of ""clothes,"" so having them itemized in a spreadsheet works well"

digitalnomad,35p4er,kristallnachte,2,Tue May 12 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"I am fairly lucky that I have family in a fixed location so I keep a few boxes there and have stuff shipped there and then when I visit once or twice a year I pick up or drop off stuff there. If they didn't want to store it or moved I'd rent the smallest storage space I could find, the key is mostly just that they can receive stuff I ship and I go there fairly regularly.  I don't actually keep or ship that much stuff though, honestly it's more of a convenience for buying and shipping stuff online in the US is so cheap compared to everywhere else. Most of my 'stuff' though I try to keep it light and small, stuff I can pack up easily, or stuff I can sell and replace easily. I go through computer monitors fairly quickly because I can buy or sell them pretty  much everywhere and the cost differential is worth the utility while the shipping is not. I really don't like selling stuff so a lot of the time I just give stuff away if I can but if you don't mind selling stuff you can avoid losing much money or even make some money just by being smart about it.   Winter clothes is one of the things I keep in storage with my family. I'm in the tropics and they are in the US so if I was to go anywhere cold I'd probably know ahead of time in order to get some stuff from there, and clothes in general are pretty easy to replace. I miss books and finding stuff locally is next to impossible but traveling with them is kind of ridiculous.. get ebooks. That's more or less necessary you'll find yourself hating lugging around any physical books you have and how many times are you planning on reading the same book? If it has sentimental value.. store it. Otherwise sell or trade it. Some of the backpacking hostels I've seen had book trades which were pretty awesome ideas. Important documents? Definitely definitely, make digital copies, backups, physical copies, and store anything you don't absolutely need. If you have reliable friends/family get storage space where they have access so you can ask them to get them if something comes up but pretty much anything you plan on travelling with, be ok with losing it.   Once you start travelling a lot and packing and repacking and dealing with luggage restrictions.. well I think you'll find a lot of the stuff you thought you need to bring with you doesn't seem so important."

digitalnomad,35p4er,BabouMC,1 point,Tue May 12 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else here, I can't answer your question directly. There is no good way to ship things around the world that you can't carry. The easiest way, IMHO, is to get a large suitcase with wheels and put all of your stuff in there. You will have to pay airline fees to take it around with you up to 50lbs; hopefully it will only be 2-3 stops before you realize that you don't need any of those things and that you should just get a storage unit for the things that you do not want to throw away.  My personal problem was that I had a storage unit at my base (Los Angeles, CA) with important documents with a trusted friend who could access the unit. The problem was that when I needed access to a document, they couldn't find it (my remembrance of where it was did not go well, and my general organization of my storage unit was not the greatest). Turns out I was able to restore the document from the source (my accountant from years ago), and didn't even need to store the document itself (it was just a convenience).  My current (best) situation is that I co-dwell in a place with a family member and they can 1) read/organize my mail and 2) maintain all of my non-transportable possessions. I also have a place to crash when I want to feel like 'home'. This is honestly the most sustainable; if you can spend a few weeks setting everything up back in the UK with a longtime friend/family member it may pay off in the long run. The few hundred pounds a month you share with them will be worth the peace of mind."

Just a bit outside of Manhattan and you can get a small closet sized unit for probably 50 USD or so a month.  Instead of shipping you might consider just instantiating your kit a few times in places you frequent as storage isn't too bad if you're not in a really pricey real estate market like Hong Kong or Manhattan itself.   EDIT: It's a bit more pricey than I thought around NYC, even for 5ftx5ft units, though still reasonable, but I did just find one for $68/month about 45 minutes away from the city, so not too bad."

You don't mention what kind of work you do, but it can be a real hassle when you have a conference call or online meeting scheduled and you're in a loud cafe, or you're out of battery because you didn't get a set next to a power plug.  Also, consider doing AirBnB's where you can work from your rental, and then go enjoy your new city/location during non-work hours.  Traveling with a cat sounds like a hassle.

I think it's outrageous that the US still expects you to file a return.   Over the course of 20 years outside of the US, I will have spent close to $10k filing US tax returns (about $500 per year)."
digitalnomad,359i7d,roveboat,2,Sat May 9 01:43:49 2015 UTC,I'm not concerned with it morally. I'm concerned about the legalities.
digitalnomad,359i7d,TaxTalkinGuy,3,Sat May 9 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"The setup is going to be different for everybody, but in the end most of us legally pay very little tax.  Some other financial benefits:   You live cheaper (no double costs) You eat cheaper (after a few years you only feel like eating local food) You adjust your spending by moving around (low on cash, go to India for a few months)"
digitalnomad,359i7d,noobatwork1337,1 point,Sat May 9 09:29:52 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, but I'd imagine it gets pretty murky as many tax codes probably have some sort of leeway/exception (see belowthread).."
digitalnomad,359i7d,road_laya,3,Fri May 8 19:44:40 2015 UTC,Here's an article that discusses this issue.
digitalnomad,359i7d,jlengstorf,3,Sun May 10 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"If you work 100% online and receive all payments directly to your home countries bank then don't worry about tax in other countries. For example if you are a remote programmer and travel all over, but are a citizen of USA, have a USA bank account, and all money is sent directly to your USA bank... you only pay tax in USA.  If you own some sort of online business and it is registered in your home country, then you pay tax there and nowhere else.   Paranoid people will tell you otherwise but I'd ignore them if I was you."
digitalnomad,359i7d,dpash,2,Thu May 14 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"If possible, set up an offshore corporation. And remember to get a VAT refund when you leave a country."
digitalnomad,359i7d,jlengstorf,4,Sun May 10 13:43:02 2015 UTC,"If you're using tourist visas, then my understanding is that you don't pay taxes in that country. Check with your accountant to be sure."
digitalnomad,359i7d,blue_one,3,Fri May 8 07:30:10 2015 UTC,"The visa type isn't really relevant. And in some countries, being a digital nomad on a tourist visa is a grey area in itself."
digitalnomad,359i7d,sts816,1 point,Fri May 8 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a feeling there's another shoe yet to drop on all this, but for now it's pretty easy to slip through the cracks.  My reasoning is that ALL of my work is done for a U.S.-registered company, paid by a Canadian corporation into a U.S. bank account. As far as any country I'm in is concerned, I'm a tourist (e.g. I take no money out of the local economy and put a lot of money into it).  I'm sure that — if I became a target for tax collection — I'd probably lose that case in court. But I'm putting enough in savings thanks to the lower cost of living abroad that I'm willing to take the risk and know I can mostly bail myself out if shit goes sideways."
digitalnomad,359i7d,TaxTalkinGuy,3,Sun May 10 09:39:54 2015 UTC,"And the least useful. For one, who actually has an accountant?

digitalnomad,359i7d,dpash,2,Wed May 13 05:04:19 2015 UTC,"That is actually the case for a lot of digital nomads.

The town is very touristy, but the food was really good. It costs 120,000 Dong ($6) to get into the old town area, since it's a UNESCO world heritage site. You pay once and can get in as many times as you like. If you do end up trying it out, check out hoianriverlifehomestay.com. They had amazing ensuite rooms and a very nice family running it. It's a ten minute walk from the old city, but the roof and rooms overlook the river.  We paid $15 per night for or room. If you're staying longer, you can probably negotiate a monthly fee. The family cooks you dinner once a week.  It's Vietnam, so even though it's a tourist town, it's still pretty affordable. Street food meals are 20,000D ($1), restaurant meals are typically under $5 per meal. You can find fancy restaurants for more of course. We're vegetarians and we're able to find all kinds of restaurants and street stalls to meet our needs. Vietnamese food is really a cut above. We've been all over Asia and have yet to find food as good as Vietnamese. You're making me want to go back right now.   Overall it's a nice place to be. Relaxed atmosphere, modern convenience. Very clean for a Vietnamese city. Hope you check it out!"

It really wasn't too available in cafes/restaurants. Not sure if you've been to Vietnam before, but a Vietnamese cafe is a mini plastic table and mini plastic chairs."

It looks like there are a few good spots for it, exploring around Travel Advisor and Google.  No?"
digitalnomad,3596df,crocadoc,3,Sun May 10 03:43:02 2015 UTC,"You should go to Da Nang instead. Hoi An is nice but similar to a Disneyworld for tourists (downtown is beautiful, but just tailor and souvenir shops).   Da Nang is the most beautiful city in VN by far, about 1 million people population, right on a great river, some of the best beaches in the country, mountains overlooking the beach (Son Tra), very few white people around, and a nice little expat area if you crave a burger or something similar.   I lived in HCMC for 6 months, and everyone who lives in Da Nang now wonders why more people don't come here. I pay $350 for a brand new 1bd apartment with a roof deck that overlooks the sunrise over the beach. Internet can be spotty, but was just fixed and works great now.   tldr; Da Nang is way better than Hoi An."

Cong Cafe is really cool and there are a bunch more hidden in the alley ways back there. Nothing like HCMC, but then again I don't think any city in the world can match Saigon for cafes."
digitalnomad,3596df,sigmax888,2,Wed May 13 01:29:50 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm jumping in late. I've never been to Hoi An, but I spent a lot of time around Bien Hoa and in Saigon. There are plenty of 'normal' cafes available in those regions, with reliable wifi. I'd assume it would be similar in Hoi An?  EDIT: I've heard recent reports that the outgoing internet cable has been damaged, so the connection speeds are suffering at the moment as a result."
digitalnomad,3596df,lola41,4,Wed May 13 10:30:58 2015 UTC,"Can't really say if it's digital nomad goodness, but Hoi An is one of my favourites places on Earth. Fell in love there."
digitalnomad,3596df,mattarse,2,Fri May 8 04:42:21 2015 UTC,The rainy season in Danang/Hoi An region can be a PITA. Lots of tropical storms and floodings. I would hang out in Nha Trang/Cam Ranh area instead due to it's more suitable geographical location.
digitalnomad,3596df,lola41,2,Fri May 8 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"I have worked digitally from Hoi An for five years - it is not a good place if you have regular deadlines and are reliant on a consistent internet service. Currently the main service cable feeding Vietnam has broken (the second time this year) which means accessing anything other than domestic sites is either frustratingly slow or sometimes impossible. These breakages take about a month each time to repair and are happening more frequently as the undersea cable was not installed properly and has become weak. Add to that frequent scheduled power outages (along with regular unplanned power cuts) and you need a very understanding boss. There are few cafes with generators and decent WiFi, the most popular is Dingo Deli on the Cua Dai Rd, the food and coffee is good there but it is not the cheapest place to eat. September to December mark the typhoon season, which runs parallel to our monsoon season. Powerouts are more frequent, it can rain for weeks without stopping and flooding is a real problem. Most houses become damp and mouldy. The visa issue is getting better (although I've yet to meet anyone that has been successful in obtaining a six month visa). A three month, single entrance tourist visa will cost $45 plus approx $20 for the invitation letter. Extensions in Hoi An can be done (like for like) and presently cost around $220. For ease, it's better to obtain your visa on arrival at Saigon airport as VOA's issued in Da Nang or Ha Noi are more expensive to extend. It's not all bad, as a lifestyle choice Hoi An is a great place in the spring and summer months and as monsoon kicks in you can always chase the sun and head south."
digitalnomad,3596df,crocadoc,2,Mon May 11 02:48:56 2015 UTC,I've in the last 2 weeks been to 3 travel agents (one in Hue and 2 in Hanoi) as well as to the immigration office in Hanoi and been told by all that you can no longer extend a 3 month tourist visa. Later this week I'm leaving for a week because of it.

digitalnomad,3596df,creatingange,2,Mon May 11 10:22:25 2015 UTC,"Usually around 2Mbps, occasionally it creeps upto 5Mbps, but is unstable. I just tried to speedtest but the network connection kept dropping out and it was unable to do a reading - the undersea cable is still broken."

digitalnomad,3596df,spyt,1 point,Fri May 22 04:52:40 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about the visa situation in Vietnam.  I think it changes on a weekly basis, last I heard (February 2015) you need to leave the country every 3 months to renew the visa.  I also heard you can pay around $200 to a travel agent to renew ONE time.    Edit: I don't have much insight on Hoi An.  I was in Hanoi during the Hoi An rainy season.  However, I have heard that the rainy season in Hoi An is very, very wet.  Like all day raining."
digitalnomad,3596df,neohampa,2,Fri May 8 04:29:31 2015 UTC,You can get six months at a time no problem. It just costs an arm and a leg. Just request six months on your visa app at any consulate abroad.
digitalnomad,3596df,spyt,1 point,Fri May 8 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  That 6 month visa is still probably cheaper than paying for a round trip flight + hotel to Bangkok, Phnom Penh, or Vientiane."
digitalnomad,3596df,crocadoc,2,Fri May 8 04:49:00 2015 UTC,Very true. Visa costs always factor into my decision to spend time in a country. I just got a ten year visa to China for $140. So paying for six months in Vietnam for $300 is a big deal.

Ideally the better College/uni you attend the better. It will be hard to secure a job that is remote if they don't know who you are.

digitalnomad,356yu2,eneeb,28,Thu May 7 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll offer an opinion that likely won't be very popular: If you don't know where to start and are looking for a ""course"" to teach you ""marketable skills"", you're probably years away from being able to DN successfully.  There's two ways to make a living:   Create something people are willing to pay for. Huge opportunities for DN lifestyle with this path. Sell your time to someone who is creating something people are willing to pay for. 50/50 chance at a DN lifestyle here as a freelancer/consultant, but much more difficult in a classic employer/employee relationship.   With that said, you need one of:   A classic employer who will let you work remotely. An existing freelance/consulting business unless you are so good at what you do you and have such healthy set of business relationships that you could get clients quickly. A market opportunity and create a new business.   Aside from the first one, which is hard (but getting easier) to come by, these scenarios require a lot of experience that it seems like you don't have.  I see a lot of posts on here from people that seem to have absolutely none of the background required for successful DN and don't really even know where to start, they just want to live the lifestyle, and understandably so.  I think this community is extremely positive in that we want everyone to be able to do it because it can be a lot of fun, but sometimes I think we are too positive and give people unrealistic expectations about how easy it is to do.  Nine times out of ten, being a DN requires that you are self-employed, and probably have been for a long time already. If it was easy, everyone would do it. It's not easy."

(not that that matters since I was trying to learn how to do it first) The way to go is figure out what  is in demand and blog about that then try to make money off it.  That is the plan right now anyway.

digitalnomad,356yu2,FYIAV,1 point,Sun May 17 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"Stronger people skills will make your entire life easier. Even if you're not good at it, watch how other people behave and fake it 'till you make it.  I was never super strong with people skills as I am more of an introvert, but over the years I've learned how to act like an extrovert when necessary and it has helped my career immensely."
digitalnomad,356yu2,open_spirit,1 point,Sun May 17 15:48:45 2015 UTC,I'm more introverted as well. Faking it makes you feel out of your element. Is there any way to avoid that situation while making the transition?
digitalnomad,356yu2,Adealy,1 point,Sun May 17 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"For me, I can be extroverted, but only for short periods of time because it wears me out, a few hours at best. The things I try to keep in mind are:   Be enthusiastic about meeting people, but not overly so. Say hi, ask people how they are doing, do it in a way that makes them feel you are actually happy to see them. This is easier if you actually are. Learn to make small talk, either about business or non-controversial personal stuff if you have worked with them before and it's appropriate. Google the FORD principle, it's an extremely helpful shortcut for this.   A while back I was working with the VP of a very large company and every time I'd see him I'd just go ""Hey John! It's been a while, how are you? How are those analytics looking?"" I knew that the analytics for the project I was working on basically determined the future of his career and that they were favorable since my team was doing a good job. It was an easy way to get him talking and excited about the project and associate those good feelings with my team. The relationship I was able to build with him was very beneficial to the company I contracted for for many years."

digitalnomad,353ppf,Julian_Snow,11,Wed May 6 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"I can give you some relevant insights. I too thirsted for location/ lifestyle independence and set forth on the path of programming, about 5 years ago, self-taught, no engineering background.   IMO Ruby on Rails with a solid background in JavaScript is as easy as it gets when it comes to current, in-demand programming skills. You could go Python-Django, or even Node.js and JavaScript frameworks (Angular, Ember, etc.) which are getting popular, but my sense is that Rails still has the hottest job market right now, and IMO is more fun and more powerful for great things like app prototyping than its JavaScript counterparts (ultimately you'll want to embrace many languages/ approaches, but for getting started + foot in the job market you should specialize). I would expect at least 1 - 1.5 years to get to a point where you could successfully market your developed skill to get a junior dev role at a company, assuming you work at it regularly. You could fork over $10,000+ and do a ""dev bootcamp"" to speed it up, if you can afford that, and they usually have a job lined up for you upon completion. I didn't set out as a digital nomad until close to 3.5 years of coding w/ most of that working under another company... so in all likelihood, you'd be trading your 9-5 for another 9-5 - and probably a much more difficult one, because the first couple years of programming w/o any CS/ engineering background at all  are pretty damn challenging. The bright side is eventually you get to a certain plateau, i.e. some unconscious competence, and then you can keep challenging yourself and do so really impressive stuff, or be a stereotypical lazy-ass dev who does whatever he wants and still pulls good money. But again, IMO you would almost certainly need to work for a company, on a team with seasoned devs, to gain some real experience before remote freelancing or having people trust you enough to work remotely full time for them. (But another bright side is that w/ your first, junior gig, potentially achievable in only a year, you could still pull serious money (in a big market city at least)."
digitalnomad,353ppf,practicalpants,2,Thu May 7 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"What would be your advice as far as learning it? I have been watching some videos, and doing the lessons at places such as codeacademy to get the basics of Python, but I pretty much figure it will get me the VERY basics and nothing else. You say 1-1.5 years of study, but WHAT exactly would you recommend studying/doing to gain that knowledge and experience if not working in the field.  Also, yes, I live in a a pretty major city, so I doubt I couldn't find a position. There are a lot of programmers where I work currently, but it would be quite the career jump as like I said previously, I'm in the networking area. I also have a friend who just did one of those bootcamps, which sounds pretty nice, but I don't know if I'd have the time for that, not to mention the worry about jobs that I would be offered....I mean....it's just a bootcamp. I'm not going to go from beginner coder to junior level at a comp with a couple weeks of cram."
digitalnomad,353ppf,practicalpants,6,Thu May 7 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just one data point, so I fear potentially giving false advice, but I do have some strong opinions on this...  Yep, CodeAcademy is not the solution, and bootcamps get you on the path for continued learning but they don't get you far enough to hold your own. I've interviewed several bootcamp participants for junior roles (Silicon Valley area), and our team passed. I'm sure they found employment somewhere eventually, given the market for Rails devs, but yeah, they really aren't that far long and probably had few options for where to work. Also, I skipped junior level straightaway to be a regular (non Senior) dev after 1.5 years of self-teaching and building my own apps, which means a much more competitive salary, and I think there's no way you can skip junior level from just doing a bootcamp.  My advice and what I did, is be madly driven by a web application with the potential to do something big - either impact the world or make you rich, and work on that relentlessly for a year. (Better, complete 2 apps over the course of 1 - 1.5 years - I did a second one after about a year of working on the first). Launch it, get users, actually run it, have the ability to accept payments. It makes for a compelling story, you have a real application(s) in your portfolio, and it shows resourcefulness that you did all this on your own.   For that, you must have someone in your life who is an experienced developer and is willing to sit with you from time to time, even if just once every couple weeks for a couple hours on a Saturday morning. There are just too many things to figure out what to focus on, what to not focus on, advice that may or not apply to you, and just many unknown unknowns.   Though not as useful as a 1-1 relationship, since you're in a big market city you can go to meetup groups where people are workshopping things, I know these exist for Ruby/ Rails at least in the SV area.   Also really good - and also what I did - pay a developer a small amount (less than $2,000) to give you a really bare bones Rails crud prototype (crud is an acronym fyi, not saying 'crap') of your app with a few best practices baked in, so bare that it doesn't fully work or anything (if you want a polished, fully functional app, it should cost $10,000+, so just aiming for a really basic codebase here). If they're an experienced Rails dev sitting with their own custom generators and what not (like me), then it really shouldn't be more than $2,000 and no more than a week of effort. Definitely make sure they're more experienced than a bootcamp grad/ anyone with less than 3 years of professional dev experience. Anyways - it should be enough code that you yourself can flesh out the rest of the app in a few months (which, congrats, that's exciting - you have a true, high potential app in a few months which you yourself are building). Maybe more importantly, it's immediately a repository of examples for how to do things which you can add onto, which is wayyy better than starting from scratch... A lot of junior dev responsibilities reduce to just reading code and mimicking what the other devs have already set up, so this would similarly give you a flesh and bones app you can mimic and iterate on. Obviously do it at a pace where you understand, spend time looking up/ asking others what's actually going on in the app. Ideally, make that person who builds your bare bones app the same person who agrees to meet with you every so often on Saturdays.   Ah, I'm now looking at a wall of text. Enough for now.   EDIT - couple words"
digitalnomad,353ppf,bentappeal,1 point,Fri May 8 05:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm in a somewhat similar position as OP and wondering if you could provide your insight/opinion of my plan:   I have a grad degree (economics) and current (decent-pay) career, but would like to start my own business.  I've done quite a bit of project management but have grown tired of taking direction from people who don't think through their plans or work very inefficiently.  I want my own business because I want to ""create something"" and I like to be in control of my own projects. My plan is to work toward developing a business that creates my apps (maybe mobile, not sure).  I may contract out parts of this work in the future, but I'd first like to build a knowledge base in programming. My plan is to learn the basic of Java, J-query, and Ruby on Rails.  (Where I am now) I'm nearly finished the all courses on Codecademy, including the other languages - python, html/css. I've had some limited experience coding some math/stats programs in school, so that has been helpful. I figure I can learn anything else that I don't know after this through forums and google. (Next) Start making apps. The only way to learn is to just do it. My plan is to make the most basic apps - a to-do list - then customize it with more unique features so that it is an app that works for me (with experience in project management, i love working with lists and planning projects). Should help me to practice my coding and to learn the app development process. When I've finished my first app, i have a number of other ideas for basic apps that I can work on.  My plan is to search for some open-source code for related apps, and to build off of that to create exactly the type of app that I want. After completing a few of these smaller projects, reassess my approach to app development. I will then start to look at my approach to monetization and consider outsourcing some of the coding, etc.  When I start to make at least 60% of my current salary, I can start to transition out of my current career. Up until this point I can dedicate a 2 hours a day + one full day per week (total of about 15-20 hours per week).   Since I don't know the process and what is involved, my expectations and plan might be way off-base (I don't know what I don't know). Does my approach seem reasonable? Any advice or suggestions? Anything would be much appreciated!"
digitalnomad,353ppf,practicalpants,2,Wed May 13 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"A little confusion... I would give different advice depending on if you yourself want to be a self-sufficient app developer vs. instead being a CEO of a dev shop that employs developers. I'll assume self-sufficient app developer here.   Just going to lay it out, your plan is not realistic. Briefly...  Don't learn Java and Ruby, pick one, huge ecosystems, very different, would take you 1 year+ to learn either. Don't pick Java unless you just want to specialize in Android apps off the bat and only do Android apps.  Scrap your to do list app idea, not a great use of your time. Build an actual app you want to make money from as your first app. You should throw yourself into the fire as a first step, because that's what learning to program takes, too many people want 'an easy' way to learn to program, but that's the wrong mindset and I'm certain correlated with failure to make it past the curve. (In that vein, CodeAcademy IMO is a waste of time for actually becoming an app developer, so I wouldn't spend much time on that).  To reiterate the advice I gave to the other guy, your best idea is not to start from scratch, but to pay a developer a small amount, < $2K, to build a stupidly bare bones prototype of your idea for a prized, money making app, and then take that bare bones prototype as your starting point for app development. Then, do tons your personal research, sit down with other developers etc. to flesh out the bare bone prototype, and turn it into the fully functional, polished app you want. Then launch it. It will take months at the minimum, but IMO that is baptism by fire, and the quickest way to jump start becoming a developer. You'll also have the codebase to re-use in part for future apps, and you'll have a ton of example of how to actually do stuff right in front of you as you learn.  (If you do Rails I would add the Michael Hartl tutorial is a must do as well, you can do it free online.)  But yeah, just to temper expectations, to get to a level to produce apps on your own at a solid rate, with good code, that other devs/ collaborators would be happy to work with, can take many years of hard work, and IMO requires at least one significant stint working under experienced developers at a dev shop/ startup/ larger company.   When I start to make at least 60% of my current salary   I'm assuming you mean make money from the apps you build, and not building apps for clients who pay you for them. Just to temper expectations again... definitely no guarantee making money with apps. The majority of intelligent, experienced developers never make significant money to live on from their apps, not for lack of effort."
digitalnomad,353ppf,bentappeal,1 point,Wed May 13 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I appreciate the honest feedback.  To clarify a few things that you mentioned:   I could see myself moving towards directing developers rather than being a self-sufficient developer. But I would like to learn enough on my own that I can develop my own basic apps first. wrt the monetization: apps are a tool (a powerful one) that I would like to employ in my business.  My aim is to have the apps be part of a larger marketing strategy (perhaps to sell the apps, perhaps provide free apps to aid in marketing other products or services).  While you are right that there is no guarantee of making money, I am am certain that this is the path I would like to pursue.   One last question, if you don't mind:  You've suggested moving right into an app that I could sell right away, and likely paying to have the bare-bones version created.  My first idea can build off of a todo list app (but with some additional specific features), so I will still create this app. In your opinion, could I not just use open-source code examples  as my 'bare-bones' app, then work to put the meat on the bones in the manner you suggested?  Or is there something wrong with that approach? (Please assume that I do want some type of a todo app).  Thanks for your time and suggestions!"
digitalnomad,353ppf,practicalpants,1 point,Thu May 14 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"Well, either way, you will be using a ton of open source libraries for your app, whether you build it from scratch, pay a developer at first, or clone a repo of someone who posted an example todo app on Github or something. The latter actually sounds pretty random, as I'm not sure why someone would post such an app, unless they are a beginner, experimenting with the language, or maybe trying to show a potential employer they can code... so I would be wary of emulating said code (if it is out there?). I can't really imagine an experienced coder putting up a repo like that.  A todo app is just very simple, I can understand an experienced coder working on and open sourcing, say, algorithmic trading software, but the core logic in a todo app, at least in the Rails world, is just a couple models and wouldn't take long.  It's not really something that I consider 'open source' either, as 'open source', to me at least, usually implies it has value, good reasons to be used, for other developers. (But I may also be ignorant of more sophisticated todo app platforms out there that people are using...).  I would also say, don't pay a developer if all you want is a simple todo app. That defeats the purpose of 'baptism by fire,' where the point is, for a cheap price you get a large-ish codebase with tons of best practices baked in, and then you dive in iterating on it... which again, IMO is the best way to learn to code.  However you could still pay a developer for your todo app + the fancy extra features you have in mind. That way you could get the larger codebase, and also integrate it with a bunch of other things that you and he could discuss, like the development, testing, and production setups, various service integrations like email, load testing, error notifications, etc. It also should be well less than $2,000, as it shouldn't be too much effort (although I don't know what features you have in mind)."
digitalnomad,353ppf,igalic,1 point,Fri May 15 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"I think your plan makes sense overall, but here are a few suggestions:   Don't go learning too many technologies at once just for the sake of learning them. Don't kid yourself you'll be able to read and understand someone else's code (in a real app) after learning the basics of a language. I think your primary goal should be to get to the point where you can build a very basic app using one technology stack, so you understand how the technology comes together. That's the important (and hard) part -- learning 5 languages won't really give you a good ROI, and can more easily be done later if needed. As for what that technology should actually be, I don't think it matters that much. I wouldn't choose something esoteric and completely different, but whether it's Django, Rails or Node, it doesn't really matter. Since you already learned basics of Python, perhaps go with Django. If you care more about being able to build your own prototype than to really grasp all the technology, you can even skip some parts. Use Parse for back-end and focus on front-end, for example -- that can cut your learning time in half.  Your idea of starting with a todo app makes sense to me. Even if you were to actually become a developer, I don't agree it makes sense to start with something overly ambitious, as some other people suggested. In my opinion, it just makes it more likely you'll get lost, make a mess of the code, overcomplicate everything to the point where it will be very hard for anyone to help you, and just lose motivation. I did that (more than once!) when I was starting out :) I do agree with others that starting off an open-source project and trying to build it into your own app might not be a great idea. An open source project doing something simple like you'll want will probably either be a beginner's work, or an experienced developer testing something out -- in either case you're probably not going to be starting off a good base.  Regarding your last point, of earning 60% of your salary before you start transitioning out, that may be the hardest part. With 15-20h / week, you can get reasonably far with learning programming, but once you try monetizing and making it a business, it tends to either suck up a lot more time, or you just won't be putting enough effort into it to make it work. You could get lucky (very lucky), but don't plan on it."

digitalnomad,353ppf,humanefly,3,Wed May 27 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"On a side note, I was diagnosed with ADD when I was younger, and the way I deal with it is this:   I make a prioritized to-do list of ALL the things I want to do. Then I start crossing shit off the list until i have a top 3 list. These 3 projects are all things that I'm really personally interested in (therefor motivated) and have the capability to complete. I break these 3 projects down into smaller tasks and make a rough timeline. Then I focus on one project out of the three. If I get bored, or tired and I need a break, I permit myself to spend time working on one of the other 2 projects. If I enjoy the first project so much that I can focus on it until it's completed, that's fine; but I have a tendency to get side tracked, so I try to channel that energy into other useful projects. I do make a point of completing projects; and if I already have 3 on the go, I do not permit myself to start something new, without finishing and cleaning up one of the existing projects. It's preferable to walk away and do something for entertainment, than surround myself with the detritus of unfinished projects.  Often each day I will try to kick all 3 projects along a little further.   Also, I bought a motorcycle. It's a form of meditation; it forces me to focus to the exclusion of everything else, and helps me to get rid of excess energy: I get to work refreshed, fired up and ready to buckle down and go. It's obviously required to be mature enough to handle the urge to twist the throttle, and ride safely.   I've also purchased rental property. This gives me a stable form of income that pays the mortgage. I've learned to hire and manage tradespeople to help maintain the rentals. By day I'm a systems engineer; I recognized fairly early that I didnt want to be management in IT, so owning rental gives me a side business that can grow into full time work if I choose, builds my net worth, and generates cash flow. I get the rewards of ownership without having to manage someone else's business. It also gets me away from the computer from time to time, and I need that. My point here is that some people can create multiple streams of income; that is as viable a path to wealth as specializing in one area, and you may find it more stimulating in that: when youre at the 9-5, you know you are using it to work towards freedom; at some point, it will give you the freedom to walk away from the 9-5 if you choose; or you can do parttime/contract work and spend your free time on the rentals.   There are multiple paths to success; ADD definitely creates certain weaknesses in today's world but there are ways to optimize your path and play to your own strengths. Recognize your weaknesses and try to create methods of managing/mitigating them.  onwards,"

As long as you keep working from 9-5 (or whatever your current hours are), you'll be ahead of them.  So if the Internet is a bit slower, they'll still get the files on time.  Sites like WeTransfer, ProofHQ, and Dropbox are a boon.  As is the FLV codec.

digitalnomad,34zrel,EwanG,6,Tue May 5 22:26:04 2015 UTC,"I've run a small startup for a few years and some of one of our core philosophies is travel -- work from anywhere. Take time off as you need it. See the world and be inspired by it.  It works, and for us it works really well now. But it is extremely difficult to get right.   You need to have a set of people who subscribe to the nomadic ideal (even if they all don't actively participate).   You need to have a set of tools in place that not only streamline project management and collaboration but really make it engaging. It is super easy to unintentionally start bucketing someone as ""the person that's out of the office all the time"", even if the quality and consistency of work doesn't change. Think about how you can carry on your professional relationships effectively through alternate media. We use a wild combination of Slack, Zoom, GitHub, Zendesk, and Hackpad.   You need to have the right kinds of projects that can adapt to not being face-to-face with your client or coworkers all the time.   You need to have super personal discipline. It is really easy to say ""I'll work from this beach in Thailand""—it is really hard to get to the beach in Thailand, look out the window of your room, and confidently choose NOT to go out in favor of your work that day.  (Conversely you can't forget why you went nomadic in the first place. Have the discipline to enjoy yourself and be flexible too!)  So, it's hard and we've nearly killed ourselves making it work. But it works beautifully now and we adapt pretty well as conditions change. It's worth every minute we spent making it work.   Good luck, new nomad!"

One of my business partners just got back from Miami Beach. Another is in San Francisco now but was just in Asia for a while. We were all in the Caribbean a few months ago. And so on and so forth.  I have an [untested] hypothesis that this gets exponentially harder to do as the size of the team scales up. Our team is small-ish (< 10 people) and it works. But I doubt it's impossible above that. I just go back to that ""have discipline"" mantra... with the right team and good discipline I suspect it could work just as well."

digitalnomad,34zrel,Kopi99,2,Thu May 7 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"I share your pain! Google Docs is a difficult thing to break people of. It took us a while to get off Google Docs, and even more awful products like JIRA.  The workflow is pretty straightforward. We create pads when we're collaborating on marketing copy, feature deployment timelines, or even just wanna brainstorm ideas. Typically one person creates the pad but everyone has access to it. When the person is ready for team collaboration, he posts the link into one of our Slack channels. With edits, comments, and the little to-do checkbox thingees, we quickly get into a smooth cadence within a pad.  What I love about Hackpad vs. Google Docs is it lives by K.I.S.S.—Keep It Simple, Stupid! Like most Google products, Docs is bloated now. It does too much for too many people. Hackpad is focused and concise:    Collaborative editing ""just works"". I know when people are editing with me and it's very responsive (even on, let's say, shitty Mexican Internet).  Minimal style capability—you can't overthink how many nested tables and bullets and embedded documents and etc. you're gonna use. :) Super clear history/changelogs.  The mobile apps are pretty tight, with some minor complaints—the push notifications are really nice for keeping up with your team's changes. Easy, tight linking across pads. Plus it's just friendlier on the eyes.   It really is a collaborative notepad, instead of a collaborative document creation package. I know very few teams that actually need what is effectively Microsoft Office jammed into the web (this is just in my industry of course—I know many industries do need that).  I think Hackpad defers to you and team making great content, rather than to ""collaboration"" for collaboration's sake, if that makes sense."

It provides a personal ID card which can be used to authenticate yourself online, and to create digitally signed documents. Estonian businesses and government organizations are required to accept both the authentication and the d-signed documents; as proof of your identity and the documents as legitimate, respectively.  The only notable exception is that banks require you to be physically present when creating an account. This is because of some legislation requires that as an anti-money-laundering measure."

As an private citizen, you still retain any existing citizenship and follow their tax laws on personal income. Any business entity you create in Estonia follows the same rules as any other business in Estonia would (which may or may not be more lenient that the rules in other jurisdictions). The main benefit of the e-residency is that without it, you will need to hire a local lawyer and give them full authority to represent you if you can't be in Estonia physically to represent yourself. With e-residency, you can represent yourself in Estonia remotely, through digitally signed documents.  Mind you, I am Not A Lawyer and this is not legal advice."

The internet situation is supposed to have gotten a lot better over the past couple years though. Still don't expect to be able to torrent and download large files but I could do most of my programming work over the ~2mb/s internet I could afford.  While Costa Rica is definitely more expensive than the surrounding countries, it is much safer and friendlier to foreigners, and still much cheaper than anything similar to it in the US or Europe. I paid $600/mo rent for a furnished nice 2bdrm condo 2 blocks from the beach in Tamarindo, which is one of the most popular (and thus more expensive) beach towns in costa rica. I'm sorry but that's US prices compared to a small town in the corn fields, not US prices for a furnished 2bdrm condo on the beach. And it gets much cheaper outside of the touristy hotspots.   I traveled for a while around the rest of central america and honestly, if you are serious about working while travelling and not just making excuses for vacationing, it just doesn't work out that well and Costa Rica is definitely the safest bet."

First, the US has some of the cheapest prices around for manafactured goods, consumer goods, and  a lot of food. Costa Rica is tiny and thus anything imported is going to be more expensive than US prices. However, if you eat the local food instead of going to buy pizza or something, then prices can be cheap for really good food. Like, $5 for a plate of rice, beans, plantain, fish and salad. You aren't going to get non-local food or goods anywhere south of the US for cheaper than it is in the US."

It will be tough to learn how to program while also in a foreign place. You should probably not change too much in your life or the shock of change will lead you to fail in all efforts (come home penniless with no technical know-how).   Why wouldn't you enroll in summer classes at the local community college to see if you even like programming? Granted, you should've done this while you had the income.

For bootcamps I'd recommend going for the most intensive ones: 40 hours of lessons per week and tons of work outside of that. I heard good things about www.devbootcamp.com.  Edit: If you want to learn online by yourself and are sick of RailsTutorial there's also the great http://railsapps.github.io/
digitalnomad,34x6kh,pjcelis,2,Wed May 6 07:10:47 2015 UTC,"You don't want to learn to code,  you want to learn and love how to solve problems and build things. Otherwise your motivation might not be enough. That being said, learning to code is very stressful but also rewarding when it finally works. I remember back in the days that I would literally google in all caps something along the lines of WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT NOW WORKING since I was just so overwhelmed, frustrated and tired at the same time :) good starting resources would be code academy, khanacademy and the odin project, good luck!"

digitalnomad,34x6kh,geeklimit,1 point,Tue May 5 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"South east asia is a great place to live cheap while doing this but I think south america might be worth looking at for you. It is going to be cheaper to get to, you will be likely on the same timezone as family/friends, also buritos.   I am a few months into SEA and have Thailand to be the best so far in terms of internet speed and comfort."
digitalnomad,34x6kh,Asswizards,0,Tue May 5 14:42:39 2015 UTC,There are also coding bootcamps you could look into.
digitalnomad,34x6kh,thedazzler,3,Tue May 5 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"IMHO if you want to travel immediately and don't have much in the way of savings, these are a terrible idea. The goal of most of these camps is to get you a position with a startup in their local area, which means you're going to likely be tied down."
digitalnomad,34x6kh,alwaysonesmaller,1 point,Tue May 5 13:41:27 2015 UTC,"OP said nothing about budget or savings, s/he said learn to code, travel, social vibe. Hacker paradise fits that description perfectly."
digitalnomad,34x6kh,thedazzler,2,Tue May 5 13:47:20 2015 UTC,"Hacker Paradise isn't a bootcamp, though. They don't promote themselves as a place to learn to code, but rather as a place to get things done and network."
digitalnomad,34x6kh,alwaysonesmaller,2,Tue May 5 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn to code as fast as possible this is your best bet, but it isn't cheap. I just finished one of these bootcamps and I can answer any questions anyone might have about one. For me it was a positive experience — I'm about to accept a job today, but it's not for everyone.   I think there should be a coding bootcamp in a cheap foreign country rather than an expensive tech hub. It could be cheaper for everyone involved, and probably more fun as well. I know a senior level instructor that is on board with this idea, if anyone wants to make it happen."
digitalnomad,34x6kh,Soulbow,1 point,Tue May 5 14:48:15 2015 UTC,How much did you know about coding before you went to the bootcamp? How long was the bootcamp? Can you give a general idea on how much you are going to be making at your new job? Are you working remotely?
digitalnomad,34x6kh,cmoneyt8ker,1 point,Tue May 5 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"I knew what a div was, that's about it. My background is in print design however, so that helped a lot. My bootcamp was 12 weeks, and I've been told by a senior developer that my freelance rate should be around 75 per hour. For full time with benefits I'd ask for around 35-40 per hour.   This job will be partially remote, however I'll likely have to go in to an office a couple times a week so I can't travel.   The thing to remember about freelancing is you need to pay for all your own benefits as well as quarterly taxes, which can be a significant amount. You also have to go out and find the clients yourself, which can take up a lot of your time. Personally, I'm starting a side business which has nothing to do with tech. If all goes well, that will be my source of a location independent income, however plenty of people do it with web development as well. I also built a small but valuable SaaS product which I'm hoping to sell to a very niche crowd on a subscription basis."

digitalnomad,34wds1,SUBZEROWINS,2,Tue May 5 02:42:17 2015 UTC,You're gonna find it hard to do any of that on the island. I work with video amongst other things and have given up on the entire country's Internet for any sort of large filesize uploading.   Hubud would probably have a freak-out if you hammered their connection - they monitor and disconnect offenders. Best to fly to KL/Singapore/Bangkok and do it there. It's relatively cheap and internet is a heckuvalot faster than Indonesia.
digitalnomad,34wds1,thatgrumguy,1 point,Tue May 5 07:59:53 2015 UTC,Have you tried Hubud?  I was under the impression it was specifically designed for people working online.  How can they block users who need the bandwidth?
digitalnomad,34wds1,thatgrumguy,1 point,Tue May 5 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've tried Hubud. Hence why I mentioned them. They block certain ports, manage the bandwidth and have chats to abusers."
digitalnomad,34wds1,levelsi,3,Wed May 6 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"The airport at Depansar has the fastest (free) WiFi with 50mbps down and 50mpbs up (at least). It's insane. It's a shame the telco's are too incompetent to wire up Ubud or any other part of the island properly.  It seems the uplink to the island itself is FINE (as the airport speeds show), but the uplink from there is broken or insufficient.  To be honest, I'd avoid Bali completely. The internet situation is unworkable now. I just came from Ubud and I wasn't able to do any serious work for the 2 weeks I was there. I've given up Bali. It's a shame as it has SO much potential if they fix the internet.  And it's going to take a long time for them to fix it. Telecom in Indonesia is a state-owned monopoly and Indonesian bureaucracy is very, very slow."
digitalnomad,34wds1,levelsi,1 point,Tue May 5 18:22:18 2015 UTC,You can get 50mpbs up on free airport wifi?!  Honest to god I wouldn't mind going to the airport once a week to just use their wifi for a couple of hours...  Can you access it without having to check into a terminal (basically public access?)
digitalnomad,34wds1,ohheybry,2,Wed May 6 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can. You can sit outside the arrivals in a coffee place and log in for free. It's pretty amazing."
digitalnomad,34wds1,crackanape,1 point,Fri May 8 20:16:31 2015 UTC,I'll definitely try that out! thanks!
digitalnomad,34wds1,lucaspiller,1 point,Sat May 9 02:07:40 2015 UTC,I need to upload videos/raw photos too! How did you go with this at the airport?
digitalnomad,34wds1,ruinenlust,3,Thu Jul 2 03:37:22 2015 UTC,"How much data are you generating on a monthly basis? Can you trickle-upload it overnight?  Broadband in Indonesia is generally crap, especially away from the biggest cities (none of which are on Bali).  Most of the net cafes are run by friendly folks who are amenable to various arrangements. One would be to pay them some amount to leave your stuff uploading overnight, when you have the entire net cafe's connection to yourself and the local internet is generally less congested."
digitalnomad,34wds1,mistalaba,1 point,Tue May 5 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"Someone suggested trying to upload overnight on the mobile 3g, but even leaving it on overnight I don't think it would be able to upload that day's worth of stuff.  I'll definitely test out your suggestion, maybe cafe connection will be better than mobile."
digitalnomad,34wds1,sobri909,1 point,Wed May 6 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"When I was there last year, outside of Kuta, both 3G and any wifi I could find in cafes / guest houses was pretty hopeless. I was just trying to check emails and have Skype audio calls, so I don't know how you'd fair with video. In Uluwatu I didn't even have cell service at one point."
digitalnomad,34wds1,sobri909,2,Fri May 8 08:21:04 2015 UTC,What part of Bali are you?

digitalnomad,34wds1,baliexpat,2,Tue May 5 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"If you're near Ubud, you might try Hubud (hubud.org). Haven't tried them but it seems promising for your needs."
digitalnomad,34wds1,baliexpat,1 point,Tue May 5 05:28:52 2015 UTC,"Yea I've been looking into them, but I'll be on the coast most of the time.  I'll definitely stop by at some point tho"
digitalnomad,34wds1,calcium,2,Tue May 5 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"The only fast-ish and reliable internet I've ever had in Bali was at the Mercure hotel on Kuta beach. But a) that was 5 years ago and might not be true now, and b) you don't want to check in to a hotel just for their internet.   If you're only staying in Bali a short while, I think you're better off just accepting that your backup isn't going to complete, leave it going, and don't pay attention to its progress. It'll finish up eventually in another country."
digitalnomad,34wds1,Rhody401,1 point,Tue May 5 09:46:02 2015 UTC,"I'll be leaving the country every couple of months for visa run/backpacking, but I'm be a bit nervous keeping two months of stuff only on my external hd...  In the end, tho, that might just be what I have to do...."
digitalnomad,34wds1,calcium,2,Tue May 5 15:39:18 2015 UTC,"Buy a second external drive and do a local backup. You should always have at least one local and one remote backup anyway.   Also, keep the two external drives separate when travelling. I put one in my checked luggage and one in my carry on, so that if one of those bags goes missing I don't lose both the originals and the backups in one go."
digitalnomad,34wds1,Rhody401,1 point,Tue May 5 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"assuming i can upload once a day or every couple of days, my harddrive is my local backup.  That's why I want to upload to the cloud so that I can clear my memory cards each day."

Or only villas?  Where in Bali are you?  I'm planning on staying in canggu for the next month or so, possibly make this my homebase for the next year. I'm trying to find an apartment and if I could get fiber that would be amazing!"
digitalnomad,34wds1,crackanape,1 point,Sun May 24 06:36:56 2015 UTC,"Someone from Telkom just came around and asked if we wanted it installed. I think we got lucky, but maybe because we have a hotel. You can try applying at Telkom office. I noticed they have many promotions on now for it. This is our place if you are ever up this way: http://www.mumbul.net/"
digitalnomad,34wds1,calcium,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:58:12 2015 UTC,You'll also want good latency.  Speed doesn't mean shit if the ping to your server is 500ms.
digitalnomad,34wds1,crackanape,1 point,Tue May 5 07:35:23 2015 UTC,"Uh, why would high latency (~500ms) create an issue for backing up large files to cloud storage? Latency is really only of concern for stuff like VoIP and gaming."
digitalnomad,34wds1,calcium,2,Tue May 5 08:05:04 2015 UTC,"High latency will cause your files to take longer when backing up.  The data is going to be chunked in general, so say each file is RAW and are 15MB each.  Depending on how the service is configured, it could use parallel chunked processing which would send a chunked subset of the file (say 50KB) to your server with a hash digest.  Once the server receives the data, it too hashes it to verify the data transmission and then returns a HTTP 200 status code (round trip 1 second).  So while you may be sitting on a 10Mb/s up line, your real data transfer speed is 50KB/s.  It all depends in the data transmission algorithm being used."
digitalnomad,34uqe4,rbm5020,4,Mon May 4 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"Hey @rbm5020, to make the prices on Nomad List as accurate as possible, they update live now based on accommodation cost.  This means that with seasonal fluctuations the cost for nomads will also vary. I think with holiday season in many places starting soon, prices of hotels, hostels and short-stay apartments are rising therefore.  The expat prices being at zero is a bug though, I've fixed that now, thanks for mentioning.  P.S. Site will be a bit slow and buggy for the next week though while I make and deploy a new version that has better caching to deal with the increased traffic. And it'll also have snappier UX etc."
digitalnomad,34uqe4,levelsi,3,Mon May 4 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"Hey levels, love Nomad List. Just have a suggestion, perhaps it would be more accurate if cost of living was linked to Numbeo and it updates live? Numbeo is crowd-sourced and I find it's pretty accurate. Not sure what your current data sources are...  Anyway, let me know what you think."
digitalnomad,34uqe4,slayerazure,3,Tue May 5 00:40:45 2015 UTC,I disagree with the model showing the current prices from any source.  It is used a research tool for planning.  There is no reason to believe the user wants high season or low season prices.  Show the variation over the year if there is a meaningful difference.
digitalnomad,34uqe4,curiouscat,1 point,Tue May 5 04:41:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is why i'm suggesting Numbeo. It does not provide seasonal prices. It's average cost of living prices throughout the year. The current model uses seasonal prices as levels just stated here - which I also don't agree with."
digitalnomad,34uqe4,slayerazure,1 point,Tue May 5 05:40:36 2015 UTC,What would you think would be a good middle ground? Show current prices and then add some functionality to time travel to e.g. December 2015 and see estimated seasonal changes?
digitalnomad,34uqe4,levelsi,1 point,Tue May 5 08:49:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, that would work. So it should show the average prices by default. But you can drill down by month (or quarter?) if you want to time travel - useful for shorter stay planning in a country.   Not sure what the back-end looks like, but I'm sure you could do this with a few tweaks and calculations."
digitalnomad,34uqe4,slayerazure,2,Tue May 5 11:08:32 2015 UTC,I think displaying it as the average price throughout the year and mouseover shows high/low would work well.
digitalnomad,34uqe4,Asswizards,1 point,Tue May 5 14:45:51 2015 UTC,That doesn't help figuring out what the prices are for a certain time of the year though. Highs and lows don't tell me which time of the year is high or which time is low. Unless you have an extensive knowledge of tourist seasons in different countries of the world...
digitalnomad,34uqe4,slayerazure,1 point,Tue May 5 21:16:58 2015 UTC,I meant something like this.
digitalnomad,34uqe4,Asswizards,1 point,Wed May 6 01:33:33 2015 UTC,High: December-february: $1000  Would work just fine.
