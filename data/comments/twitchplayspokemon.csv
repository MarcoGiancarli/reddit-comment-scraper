He's joking of course. But then he tells you how you will die... Ephie - The Fading Grace A girl who appears lifeless and still.  (Name comes from ""ephemeral"". Her design is inspired by a flower called the Ghost Orchid. Head canon why she remains a ghost-type is that she is possessed by the hidden ghost girl) Dahlia - The Woman in Black A woman perpetually in mourning. Her many husbands have all met early demises, she growing richer each time.  Rumor has it that she has a heart of ice. Darius - The HazMaster Darius is an expert in all things hazardous.

I forgot how tough it was to create animations for someone who doesn't have one... So here's Sidney, he was always kinda well dressed originally so I wanted to keep that with his new type. I figure magicians tend to wear fancy suits of sorts and that works well with the psychic type.  The name Sidney is a real name sharing the first few letters of ""sinister"" to symbolize a dark type. So I found the name Espen for psychic because it starts with the letters ESP."

But now that she's ghost type again I can just make her actually look like a ghost type trainer and call it good."
twitchplayspokemon,3e2urn,SlowpokeIsAGamer,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:57 2015 UTC,Maybe you should re-name her Persephone.  Phoebe never made much sense to me.    Edit: Unless that's what we called Lorelei in FireRed.  I don't remember...

twitchplayspokemon,3e42n3,Brandon00151,9,Tue Jul 21 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"If you mean on the hall of fame, then yes."
twitchplayspokemon,3e42n3,NotHolyLatios,9,Tue Jul 21 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest, that's really the most unique part of this run (and how heavily Ghost-leaning the run has been in general with how few Ghosts previous teams have had).  That's why I'd consider the Jelly couple to be the Signature 'Mons of this run.  They really stand out for what the randomization element brought to this run (a Duskull and Wingull caught minutes within each other ended up evolving into the same 'mon).  As others have stated, the Jelly couple felt like the Mom and Dad raising the family (including the Swinub egg from the daycared 'mons).  It also really helped that Female and Male Jellicents have such distinguishing features that make them so different."
twitchplayspokemon,3e42n3,zg44,8,Tue Jul 21 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, this is the first Egg we raised to the Hall of Fame too right?"
twitchplayspokemon,3e42n3,jespoke,6,Tue Jul 21 20:39:58 2015 UTC,Yes.  And it might get to level 100 before we're done too.

twitchplayspokemon,3e42n3,jespoke,0,Tue Jul 21 20:44:14 2015 UTC,I thought the signature mon was Sabu the lanturn... at least after Arrr's reiterment anyways

twitchplayspokemon,3e42n3,mesamus,7,Tue Jul 21 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Yep. It was a good pokemon to have too, with a typing that was offensively good against 3/5 E4 members, and defensively good against two of them."

But it's not likely when the chat leadersare here they won't help the chat to fix that...  (well when I am writing this message they are here already)  And the fact that is we are gradually doing better and better is prev urns before we lost Thief. Even Wigglytuff itself nearly beat Drake last time with some luck. If moveset is fixed we will be able to reach Drake again and beat him in not many runs....  And another key is if Steven really in Fire type. If yes, he would be much easier for us to beat because of those 2 high level jellies.  If our moveset is fixed quickly and Steven is in fire type, I guess 60 to 70. If Steven isn't, it may take to 80.  But sure I am still dreaming for >106, which Emerald record will be beaten.  WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!   PS: For round 2 there's too few information now, but that all lv100 I should still bet on my >100 attempts dream maybe   PS2: For round 2 there's another important factor that we guaranteed to get OP BST Mega-Rayquaza to our team, even it is with suck randomized move, by teaching TMs it probably won't be bad. May lowered much round 2 attempts from what we imagined."

twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,itsNowOrNever13,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:04 2015 UTC,We are. I have no idea how we're going to manage that considering what this is taking though.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,M4Lyfe,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:40 2015 UTC,160 for round 2 makes no sense.  By then all our pokemon would have been level 100 for like 100 runs and we obviously would have made a big change in strategy.  If it takes like more than 20 runs once we all hit 100 then it's obviously not possible and we'll probably resort to item use.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,itsNowOrNever13,4,Tue Jul 21 16:38:06 2015 UTC,We are struggling with most of our team being 15-20 levels over the E4 ones. I honestly don't see how we can do it quickly with even levels (unless randomizer blesses us with crap movesets for the E4 R2).

twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,Sereg5,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:03 2015 UTC,Using items properly in TPP? Really?
twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,M4Lyfe,3,Tue Jul 21 17:23:21 2015 UTC,I'm one of the most vocal people against E4 item use but if it's not possible it's not possible.  Of course I'll want us to try various different strategies before even thinking of using items.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,Sereg5,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:17 2015 UTC,I think they're saying that they're saying that using items correctly is itself impossible.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,M4Lyfe,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:26 2015 UTC,All part of the challenge.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,CakeWantMore,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:27 2015 UTC,I've been saying that using items correctly is a challenge in itself for ages.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3254,Singmeloetta,3,Tue Jul 21 19:14:50 2015 UTC,Yes but not nearly as much of a challenge as doing an E4 urn without items.  Using items outside of battle is fairly easy.

I mean, in OR we didn't really have one either because of how the team all had their roles, but in AS its been interesting that they all sort of bounce off each other. We've got a giant family now (with half the team being considered an actual family) and each has had their big moments.   Though if I had to pick one, I think Mr. and / or Mrs. Pringles would probably be it. Once they kicked off the ghost theme (while we still had Ra in the group) just everything to come up with them and their role as parental figures to the group have become quite a staple in almost all team artwork and several stories. Battle wise they've been fairly reliable, between their movesets and Mr. Pringles having Flame Body saving us at some odd times, its been a pretty sweet run having them."

The Jellies are a couple and choosing one over the other would be wrong, but Swinu is their adopted daughter and her life has been quite important, she took up Ra's role and and her psychic is helpful in the E4."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Sereg5,6,Tue Jul 21 18:39:30 2015 UTC,Which pokemon has been with us the longest that's still in our party?
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,M4Lyfe,9,Tue Jul 21 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"That'd be the Male Jellicent, by about 3 minutes.  Hilariously enough, 3 minutes later we caught the female one."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,M4Lyfe,8,Tue Jul 21 17:41:38 2015 UTC,Maybe we should just say the Jellicent Twins are the Signature mons.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,boolerex,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:03 2015 UTC,"Was one of the jellies,don't know which one."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,jespoke,5,Tue Jul 21 17:41:00 2015 UTC,The Jellies as a couple definitely takes it for me if you discount the Lamp
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Spirit_Tsunami,5,Tue Jul 21 18:15:13 2015 UTC,"Most of the mon-based lore revolves around Lamp. If I had to choose from among the party members, it's obviously Swinu because of how she plays off of the rest of the crew and what she means to the run, but it's kind of...I guess the Decoy Protagonist trope is in play. Lamp is the star, but not actually the hero in the end.  And I wouldn't say he was gone MOST of the run. He left early in Day 2, came back early in Day 3, and was boxed near the end of Day 5...huh. I guess that's not even 4 days."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,MegamanOmega,9,Tue Jul 21 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"Lamp if you really need to narrow it down to one.  But really considering our current team no one really stands out above the rest. Thanks to the exp share I find we're more focusing on the team as a whole rather than one specific mon.  More often than not the best lore I've seen with our team has two or three mon bouncing off each other rather than the traditional ""look at this one awesome mon and their five tagalongs"""
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,tustin2121,7,Tue Jul 21 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"The Lamp has been the signiture.   Of the rest of the party we have now, probably the Jellies and their adopted son Swinu (seeing as we raise Swinu from a baby, and he's now the acting Lamp)."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Sereg5,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:11 2015 UTC,Um... Swinu's a girl.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,tustin2121,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:56 2015 UTC,ಠ_ಠ
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,RJWalker,4,Tue Jul 21 19:30:09 2015 UTC,Chanseytuff and the Jellies.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,super-redguy,7,Tue Jul 21 19:12:01 2015 UTC,I guess Lamp's really our most prominent member.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,smokemonster84,6,Tue Jul 21 17:46:08 2015 UTC,Lamp overall  Jelly Couple from the current party
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,UselessBeedrill,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:18 2015 UTC,Either lamp or jellies.  Maybe lantern
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,mrdrsirman,3,Tue Jul 21 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"Corsola for sure, 100% best mon, literally God, #SaveSenpaiCorsola"
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Wahisietel,3,Tue Jul 21 19:05:13 2015 UTC,Wigglytuff or Swinu.  IMO Pokémon have to actually reach the hall of fame to be considered a signature 'mon. Sorry Leech King. Sorry Lamp.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,zg44,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:11 2015 UTC,Leech King reached HoF though.  I assume you mean have to stay in the party to the very end to be considered the signature 'mon.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Deadinsky66,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"Wait, then if Leech King isn't the signature mon of AR, who is?"
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,zg44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I would call Leech King the signature 'mon overall, but if people are talking about only 'mons that reached the ending, then it was clearly ICU which carried the 2nd half of that run (from Yoshi's corner grind onward, ICU was the powerhouse by far and remained on the team the longest other than Leech King)."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Kelcyus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'll go Swinu Pringles, the torchbearer."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,LyraCharles77,7,Tue Jul 21 20:29:09 2015 UTC,"Lamp  Even if not on the team anymore, Lamp  Otherwise, probs Swinu"
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,MKRX,5,Tue Jul 21 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"Nobody has been more influential to the L  R E than Lamp, but as far as usefulness, probably a tie between the Jellies."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:07 2015 UTC,Whenever he was on the team he was the most useful. Even with that ability.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,ChezMere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Only because everyone else was underlevelled, because we kept him on the team too long..."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"We had XP share on and he wasn't the front of the party, we didn't help anyone but Feer by replacing him. Everyone else would level up about the same, except for the fact that they blacked out more."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,ChezMere,0,Tue Jul 21 18:19:33 2015 UTC,Wrong timescale.... I'm saying back in Rustboro is when we should have done it.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,MKRX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only time he was useful was when he was SE on something and had a massive level advantage. Most of the others usually didn't need those two things to be good."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,3,Tue Jul 21 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"He had FUCKING LAND'S WRATH, not to mention his two stab moves. Most 'mon in this urn don't get one stab move."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,MKRX,0,Tue Jul 21 18:18:11 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really matter when all it takes is one mon that's faster than him to make all his moves half power (which is basically everything, 55 base speed is slower than a lot of unevolved Pokemon, lol). He'd definitely be useless right now too with E4's speed and coverage gimping him before he takes out 2 mon. He'd basically be another Revoseed."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:04 2015 UTC,"Only if they can get rid of half his HP in that one hit. Plus, even half power, Land's Wrath is still better than a lot of our other 'mon's moves."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Revoseed, isn't he a hell of a lot worse than Lamp? Why not leave him behind instead of our top 'mon? Too late now, I guess."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,MKRX,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"Stat wise, they're almost identical, they have the same speed and tankiness and Cacturne has slightly higher offense, but who knows what moves Lamp would have if we kept him as long as Revo, he could easily have been way less useful without Land's Wrath and whatever other good stuff he might gain and lose."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"He'd need to have every move changed. He had Land's Wrath, Shadow Ball, Fire Punch, and Rock Throw. In other words, two stab moves, a legendary signature, and two moves to cover electric types. And we had to raise Revoseed from a really low level. If we had Lamp, he'd probably be 100 by now."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Sirrianne,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:58 2015 UTC,Jelly couple should be an option
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,pfaccioxx,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"Arrr, with Swinu being a close 2ed  (thoth Feereon was an amusing adisson what with her trying to act all thouth wile being so naturally cute)"
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,ChezMere,3,Tue Jul 21 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it could be anything besides the Jelly Twins, counted as a pair. Counting either one on its own kinda misses the point."

twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Armleuchterchen,4,Tue Jul 21 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"I know, right? I put it on there more as a joke and then EVERYBODY votes for it.  Are we really going to have a signature 'Mon who's not even on the party for 3/4ths of the run?  Also kinda surprised Chanseytuff isn't winning, it hit 100 first, it was our main grinding 'Mon the whole run."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,8,Tue Jul 21 17:44:39 2015 UTC,"This is reddit, it's not about the run, but about the lore"
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,zg44,6,Tue Jul 21 17:57:54 2015 UTC,This is true.
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,N8-disciple-of-foot,4,Tue Jul 21 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Even on chat, most of the hash tags were about the lamp."
twitchplayspokemon,3e3fph,Sereg5,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"That was just the #DampTheLamp movement though, didn't really represent the majority of anything, perhaps a strong minority at best."

twitchplayspokemon,3e36fm,Chauzu,3,Tue Jul 21 18:35:28 2015 UTC,I think it's more that Psychic types are physically weaker rather than Cacturne is physical. And we need to be careful not to teach it to a mon that doesn't need it.
twitchplayspokemon,3e36fm,vulpinator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though I do agree that it'll be useful against that Hypno we can't risk accidentally erasing a better move on a different 'mon. The Jellys should be able to one-shot them with Shadow Ball after a little while, though that won't necessarily be easy to coordinate (since there's a few people that spam the coordinates to switch Pokemon and how neither Jelly is leading)."
twitchplayspokemon,3e36fm,animex75,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"It can't be too much longer until one of the jellies can 1-hit-KO Hyno, right? Can't we just move one to the top of the party? Then cactus can actually level up via exp share."
twitchplayspokemon,3e36fm,NebulonsStyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think we should get Wiggly to 100 before getting Thief.  Just to wrap up that loose end."
twitchplayspokemon,3e36fm,Duplex_be_great,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"Not necessary.  If we really need to teach something, teach it Dark Pulse, which will buff it from a 4hko to a 3hko on Hypno."

twitchplayspokemon,3e36fm,M4Lyfe,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:20 2015 UTC,Yes but the cactus's job is just to make it so no one gets poisoned.  He doesn't need thief to do this job therefore it isn't worth it to go out of our way to get it.
