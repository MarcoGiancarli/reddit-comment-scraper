homura,3dkmqs,TheDisappointedPanda,5,Fri Jul 17 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"Dude what if Homura stored technology and notes in her shield every time she rewound, and kept getting people to advance her technology every timeline, and then eventually she got AI-controlled jets and tanks and other weapons and beat Walpurgisnacht thru tech advancement? :O"

homura,3d2ijp,kjs309,6,Mon Jul 13 00:23:13 2015 UTC,Those contests are some bullcrap.
homura,3d2ijp,JubJub87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:29:33 2015 UTC,"Guess I won't disagree, they're just an amusing way to see what /r/anime thinks of certain characters."
homura,3d2ijp,JubJub87,2,Mon Jul 13 00:34:53 2015 UTC,I guess I just like the contest because people dump votes into new characters so much.
homura,3d2ijp,JubJub87,6,Mon Jul 13 00:41:31 2015 UTC,"Oh the contest is surely skewed towards the newer characters, I mostly vote for fun... if my favorite characters are eliminated I don't take it too personally. After all, homura will always be best girl, even if everyone who has ever watched PMMM vanishes off the face of the earth. homura = best girl is simply a universal, unchangeable fact."

homura,3d2ijp,homurakomura,2,Mon Jul 13 05:22:49 2015 UTC,I'll admit I had trouble voting for Homura against Konata.  But I'm not subscribed to /r/homura for nothing!

homura,3cvc67,TheDisappointedPanda,16,Sat Jul 11 02:06:40 2015 UTC,The letter is either from Homura or not from Homura. Both possibilities are equally terrifying.
homura,3cvc67,ChainedProfessional,7,Sat Jul 11 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is the start of a yandere anime, I'd be on board"

homura,3cmjta,TheDisappointedPanda,16,Thu Jul 9 01:54:30 2015 UTC,Those images imply that Homura wouldn't try to do the classic yawn and reach which is absurd.
homura,3cmjta,Battlepidia,12,Thu Jul 9 03:17:29 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, sure, but she'd do that in the middle of the movie.  The end of the movie might make things a little awkward for them."
homura,3cmjta,man_and_machine,13,Thu Jul 9 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"Probably tried that midway through the movie, but they went back to their own seats after the ending"
homura,3cmjta,Kyakan,16,Thu Jul 9 03:53:31 2015 UTC,"This image is implying that Homura is mortified by the ending, implying that she thinks it wasn't the right thing to do...which is of course preposterous.  Homura did nothing wrong!"
homura,3cmjta,Tazato,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:42:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's more 'oh shit, that's the last time I get drunk and start ranting during one of Mr Urobochi's brainstorming meetings.' than 'what the fuck?' there.  I also think Madoka's 'someone's about to get SHAFTed' look is pretty funny.  And if this is the canon timeline, Kyubey's gonna die. Permanently."
