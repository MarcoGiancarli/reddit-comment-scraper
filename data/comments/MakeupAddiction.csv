MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lallybroch876,14,Mon Jul 20 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"This isn't make-up related, but still in the beauty realm - what do you do for your hair? Is that it's natural texture or do you style it with products/tools? Looks similar to mine after I work on it a bit, but I'm trying to cut down on the time it takes."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lallybroch876,28,Mon Jul 20 04:02:22 2015 UTC,"I wish i could say i have some super styling secret, but that's just my natural texture! Although, a couple things that help my waves look nice is that i co-wash (washing with silicone-free conditioner only, no shampoo), and i don't use heat on my hair. I just let it air dry. If I want my hair to be really wavy and voluminous, at night i'll spritz my hair with water so it's a little damp (or 90% air-dried if i took a shower), then french braid it and sleep on it. Then i take it out in the morning and voila! Beautiful, natural-looking waves all day. just make sure to braid it as far down as you can to avoid an awkward straight part at the bottom haha"
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lallybroch876,14,Mon Jul 20 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's amazing to me, haha. I wish I could fully air-dry, but my hair just stays eternally damp without heat. Do you have problems with getting too oily using only conditioner?"
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,Inkwell1988,48,Mon Jul 20 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"I have stupidly thick hair, so i also have the eternally damp problem, but unless i'm going somewhere that requires me to actually look nice, i take all my fucks and throw them out the window. Also I take showers at night so my hair is dry in the morning haha.   And no, not at all. The opposite actually. When you co-wash, you don't strip your hair's natural oils like shampoo does, so your scalp doesn't freak and over-produce oil. It HAS to be silicone free though (no dimethicone or other -cone ingredients), because silicone isn't water soluable, so it has to be washed out with shampoo. Then it's just a vicious circle. With silicone free conditioner (i like Suave naturals or Tresemme's new silicone free conditioner), you just saturate you hair with it, massage it like you would shampoo, and rinse it out with water and you're good to go! Much healthier for your hair and will extend the time it takes for your hair to look greasy. Check out /r/FancyFollicles, they have a ton of great info about it!"

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,1_800_COCAINE,5,Mon Jul 20 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"Co-wash for life!   Even works with straight hair that began to have oil overproduction issues. I used to be so oily that I thought I had to wash it every day (sometimes twice a day), but now I'm good for 3/4 and the I do a dry shampoo day and start over. As a working mom of two, this saves my time."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,1_800_COCAINE,3,Mon Jul 20 12:58:53 2015 UTC,"Does co-washing work to remove product, too? I have a pixie cut and usually wear a pomade or something that I feel a need to wash out before bed."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,milkthi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"if your product has silicone in it, you will need a shampoo to wash it out. Silicone is not water-soluble so it cannot be rinsed out with just conditioner. However, Here's a great list of silicone-free hair pomades/styling products!"
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,milkthi,3,Mon Jul 20 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"This is super helpful, thank you for all the detail!"
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,kris10ski,8,Mon Jul 20 05:18:50 2015 UTC,You're welcome! Learning about co-washing was a game changer for my hair. And a relief on my wallet...

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,missgonzo,4,Mon Jul 20 06:05:42 2015 UTC,Would you mind sharing which conditioner you use and your general process? I looked on r/fancyfollicles but there's no general thread
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,missgonzo,36,Mon Jul 20 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"Sure! I started out with Suave Naturals, but right now i'm using Tresemme's Perfectly (un)Done conditioner. I wet my hair, the squeeze out the excess water. Then i completely saturate my hair with conditioner (and i mean completely. you're going to use A LOT of conditioner. That's why Suave is good because it's cheap). I run a wide-tooth comb through my hair to distribute the product evenly (you don't have to do this, i just like to because my hair is so thick), then i massage the conditioner in for a few minutes. I like to sing a song as loud as i can, or pretend i'm being interviewed on the Tonight Show during this time. Then, rise the conditioner out completely. If you rinse it all out, your hair should not be weighed down or oily looking. Let dry and there you have it! I was so surprised how soft my hair was the first time i did this, and that it was actually clean! And after doing it for a couple months, my hair can go up to week before it looks greasy and needs washing (I do not recommend testing out how long you can go if you have to be around people. It's the summer, i'm in a cave of laundry and netflix. But my hair looks fabulous)."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,missgonzo,8,Mon Jul 20 06:23:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for taking the time to type this out and fully explain it! I have straight, fine hair but a lot of it and co washing seems to work best for ladies with curly and thick hair. Would this work? Also, how do you know when the conditioner is washed out?  Thanks again:) I'm looking forward to trying this!"

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,Valiant__Dust,2,Mon Jul 20 09:12:55 2015 UTC,Try Walgreens! That's where I get mine. :)
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,MBA_IN_WUMBOLOGY,2,Mon Jul 20 09:54:03 2015 UTC,"I found em at a drug store today actually haha. I'm curious, which one do you use? The coconut and jojoba or the aloe and avocado?  They were on sale so I got one of each. In the past I only used the aloe/avocado kind."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,tryshapepper,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"I use the Tresemme Perfectly (un)Done conditioner, which is different from the Tresemme Naturals line, but i think the are both silicone free. As long as you look in the ingredients and there is no dimethicone or other -cone ingredients in it (or the bottle says silicone free), you're good to go!"

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lahema,3,Mon Jul 20 21:18:47 2015 UTC,I find it helps to towel dry my hair before i let it air dry. Scruff my scalp then flip my hair over and rub down sections from root to tip. That also seems to help my waves gain definition.
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,yoyohydration,7,Mon Jul 20 09:15:13 2015 UTC,So u see you've used the dip brow and the brow wiz. How do you use them both? :/
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,dewhashish,27,Mon Jul 20 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"I use the Taupe dipbrow to fill my brows and block out the shape, then I use the brow wiz in a darker color to clean up the tails, define the edges, and darken any sparse areas not taken care of by the dipbrow. Using a lighter color pomade and a darker pencil allows me to get a consistent, even brow without having to use a dark color all over and end up looking like Groucho Marx, which is easy because my brows are very blonde haha. I hope that makes sense!"
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,Valiant__Dust,8,Mon Jul 20 03:29:41 2015 UTC,That is such a good idea! I'll try your technique tomorrow. Thank you :)

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,thundercloudnine,8,Mon Jul 20 03:33:18 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this look is lovely! Dramatic yes, but still very wearable. The only CC I would give would to maybe blend out the inner corners of your eyeshadow a teeny bit. On the left eye in particular it seems a little harsh around where it lays by tearduct and like it doesn't really blend to your skin. If that was intentional though just ignore me!  Also, is that your natural hair color? Because it's gorgeous and I am so jealous. I've been trying to achieve a shade like that for almost a year as I attempt to go back to my natural color."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,Wildernessinabox,4,Mon Jul 20 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know if i see what you're talking about. The little lines extending in the inner corner from my lashline? Because that was intentional haha. But thank you!  And no, but it's VERY close. i have about 6 inches of roots right now so you can see my natural color on top in the pictures. I dyed my hair dark brown a year ago and the color you see on the bottom is the result of three separate salon visits to get back to my natural color. I loved my brown hair but being a blonde, my roots shone like a beacon of laziness in the sun. The struggle."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,justabagel,3,Mon Jul 20 05:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yes! I'm terrible at describing things properly. As an intentional move it's awesome then!  I know that struggle, you look like your balding if you don't recolor the roots within a week or so of them showing. D: It was such a hassle when I had darker hair. We look to have about the same natural color then, it's a really hard color to match with dye."

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,ShesGotSauce,3,Mon Jul 20 06:26:49 2015 UTC,Yup I love it on you specifically because it's mauve.  That color has a way of 1) popping and 2) still making someone look sophisticated and color-coordinated

When using a graphic liner I try to do the side that is harder first then it helps that the side of the face that is generally easier to do is easier to make even. Cuts the back and forth trying to even it out for me.
