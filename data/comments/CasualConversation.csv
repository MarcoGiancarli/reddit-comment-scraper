CasualConversation,3e2g5w,foxsable,11,Tue Jul 21 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"Awesome story man  I always wonder when I hear this, aren't you like sweaty and miserable? I hate being in sweaty clothes when I have to actually do stuff like walk into places.   You might want to troll pawn shops and find a cheap used gps that still has active data. you can get a cheap bike mount for it. A hydration pack would help with the water if you didn't want to stop. Or just buy a cheap backpack that has a ""headphone hole"" and you can usually poke a hose through there. You can get a bladder pretty cheap at walmart."
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,foxsable,8,Tue Jul 21 13:29:07 2015 UTC,"Sweaty is an understatement. By the time I made it, all of my clothes were soaked. I mean soakkkeeeddd. My shorts were even dripping at one point. It was absolutely disgusting, you're damn right. I smelled like ass. But when I got to Taco Bell I wiped my body down in warm, wet paper towels to clean up and put on a fresh set. I dried my old clothes off with the hand drier so they didn't soak through my bag. And I brought a hat to put over my dirty hair. So now that I'm settled down in the air conditioning, I feel quite clean, honestly. Just not my hair.  I have no desire for a GPS. I will be getting data back in a few days so I'm not worried about it. And stopping for water is no problem for me, it gives me a chance to rest and relax for a moment while I hydrate. Those couple minute breaks do a lot for me."
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,foxsable,4,Tue Jul 21 13:36:37 2015 UTC,"Cool. I like neat devices, and I have a backpack fetish, so... I have way more than I need.  The extra set of clothes was well done. Nice work with the drier too. You'll know next time to pack a few extra plastic grocery bags to put wet clothes in. And some deoderant/cologne if you didn't already!   I like the initiative though. Like your own personal stand by me journey."
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,Ellazilla,3,Tue Jul 21 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, I definitely thought of the plastic bag. But not until after I hit the road. I will still pick one up later, my clothes are fairly dry but I still would like something to contain it just in case, because of how long I will be out. And yes, I alwaayyysss bring deodorant. It's an essential part of my every day carry, even when I'm not biking.  Do you do backpacking, or hiking, or camping?"
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,Direwalrus,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:44 2015 UTC,"Sadly no. My wife doesn't do outdoors very much. Maybe once a year i can get her to go hiking with me, which is nice, and when she does, she does everything I do as hard as I do it. I would love to go backpacking and camping again but none of my friends seem to want to commit. I am trying to do a bike trail with overnight stay on the C & O Canal Trail soon, if I can get a friend to go."
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,BrinxJob,8,Tue Jul 21 14:07:51 2015 UTC,"for adventures like this, I would sugggest carrying some dry shampoo. Dove has a pretty good one that is cheap (I think its around 2-3$?) I'm only suggesting brands because some dry shampoos have felt so disgusting and have not worked in my hair at all to the point where I need to immediatly wash it out of my hair Its super easy to use. Your just lift up your hair, and spray your roots, let it sit for a couple min, then brush out"
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,BrinxJob,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:00 2015 UTC,"Sure wish I could bike around and just have an adventure. I'm paranoid that I'll die, get mugged, get mugged and die, or get lost."
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,BrinxJob,5,Tue Jul 21 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for getting lost. But I've gone through all sorts of places at all hours of the night and nobody gives a damn. Of course, there still are incidents, but I honestly think you'll be fine as long as you don't provoke anyone. But you know the area you live in better than me!"
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,BrinxJob,5,Tue Jul 21 17:03:02 2015 UTC,"Ha, that's one way to spend a night! I used to do stuff like this all the time in really bad manic states. Sometimes I'd follow through with my plan, spend a day in the nearest city or what have you. Other times, I'd end up getting off the train in NYC with no recollection of how I got there or why I had a fishing pole with me in the middle of Manhattan.  Thank god for psych meds."

Plus seeing the finished product and knowing you completed something is a big part of how people like us work, I think."
CasualConversation,3e2g5w,PossiblePixx,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I have no tools at all. My parents and family live many miles away, so I can't easily borrow anything. And I have no material to work with either. Maybe next time I visit my grandpa I can ask about it."

CasualConversation,3e0le1,Aurailious,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you've ever studied art and it's been a couple of years since I was properly in the artistic academic headspace, but I'd like to offer some advice. You clearly have found the style you enjoy producing and have put enough practice into your techniques to put up some complete works, but your execution lacks proper forethought, and I'll explain why.  In abstract art composition is everything. When you look at a properly composed piece your eyes will naturally move around the canvas following a visual hierarchy. They will absorb all of the present elements and eventually land on a visual resting point where your eyes can relax for a few moments, before being lead around the canvas again, enjoying the natural flow.  Most of your pieces do not allow for this. They are extremely frenzied and agitate the eyes while they look for a resting point where there is none, and are subsequently overwhelmed and lead off the canvas altogether. You do not want to make your viewer subconsciously uncomfortable to the point of rapidly losing interest and walking to the next canvas in the gallery. You want them to be drawn in and get lost inside the painting. You make some really cool designs, that's for sure, but while there is a lot to look at, there is also... nothing.  Here is a neat little 4 page lesson on abstract composition that relates to what I'm talking about.  Here is an excellent beginners lesson on photography composition where everything there can also be directly applied to abstract painting.  Securely Suspended is your best (not strictly the only) example of composition done right. Let me demonstrate the difference between my own eye path when looking at that piece, compared to, for the nearest example on instagram, Watermelon Frooties.  Path 1, lands at focal point.  Path 2, falls off canvas  As you can see, my eyes had a much smoother, enjoyable time dancing around the diagonal parallel lines of Securely Suspended than they did while following the dark zones and chaos of Watermelon Frooties, where I could not find a comfortable place to rest and so was subconsciously forced to divert gaze elsewhere. Both paintings were made using one technique and share common elements, yet they have very different principles at play.   Both paintings share the following elements:   Form Line Texture Colour   However only Securely Suspended makes use of the following principles:   Rhythm Unity Emphasis Balance Pattern   Despite the freedom you enjoy by putting paint wherever you feel like, try being deliberate with your placement to achieve those principles, then critique your work far beyond conditions such as ""yeah that looks cool, I like it."" There is an abundance of learning materials for art out there, enjoy reading it all. Find some established artists who inspire you and analyse their work in a new way. I want you to research the ""elements and principles of art"" and practice incorporating as many as possible into your paintings. Once you have a good understanding and work out how to properly apply them, this will seriously bring your artwork up to the next level.  I hope this helps, if you have any questions please ask, I'd love to help. Good luck and congrats on selling your first piece."

CasualConversation,3e0le1,Bananaelf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:23:25 2015 UTC,"Connecting with people is the thing.  Its not about if its easy or not or notions of what constitutes ""talent"" ( there is no such thing)  - But context exists, and getting ideas out of your head and into the world, even if its a stream of consciousness kind of process - has value.  People worry a lot about understanding abstract art, as we are indoctrinated by a culture of mass media entertainment where everything is familiar and comes together to make sense - reinforcing these grand meta narratives - good vs evil, etc.   Its natural for people to find security in meaning.   Art rather tries to transcend the deluge of that kind of culture, to present alternative and multiple truths or raise fundamental questions about the our human condition.   I think your paintings have an honesty and a earnestness about them.  I'm not surprised you sold one.  I think 100$ is a steal for an original artwork. From anyone."

Other ones include taking a shoe off and putting it back there with the kid or putting a stuffed animal in the front seat and then switching it out with your kid when you drop them off.

You get in the car and if the kid falls asleep you just sort drive in auto mode.   Little ones aren't very noisy, and they often will take an early morning nap.  Honestly, I always kept my laptop bag in the back with the kid if I could.  Same thing as that suggestion.    It wasn't a value statement, it was just a reminder.    Nobody values string tied to their finger any more than say what they're trying to remember either."

CasualConversation,3e2r2i,sk8rrchik,6,Tue Jul 21 17:11:31 2015 UTC,"It happens usually with parents that take turns dropping the kid(s) off, and think the other patent has the kid. We check for our phones every time we leave the car. That may not check for the kid if the other parent usually has them. Mashes sense to me, anything it takes to keep it from happening."
CasualConversation,3e2r2i,puttysan,3,Tue Jul 21 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"When you're not the parent that cares for the child and work most days, it's plausible you can forget you picked the child up from daycare/sitter/whatever.   Having your phone/wallet on you is probably as routine as it gets. Placing it next to your kid in the car is a good way to make sure it never happens. At least that's the explanation given whenever this topic comes up. The last big coverage this type of story happened, the parent that was the main worker had to pick the child up from daycare and forgot about him/her until it was too late."

There was a long piece in the Washington Post several years ago about infant deaths in cars, and it really drives home the point that this can happen to anybody.  Something disrupts your routine so you focus on that and don't remember the kid is still in the car, you're not the one who usually drops the kid off, you've swapped cars with your spouse so the car seat isn't where you'd normally see it, etc, etc -- add in stress and exhaustion, and even the most conscientious parents make horrible mistakes.

There is never a time where she doesn't ask. omg. She has never forgotten a child but the fear is there. I just don't exactly understand how you forget that you brought your child in the first place? idk. I get it. But I don't. I just can't imagine being in the situation. But who knows, under certain circumstances... maybe I could forget. It's hard to say unless we're in the moment it happens.

He said I wasn't a ""classic beauty,"" but the way I looked around at things and presented myself was beautiful and model worthy. It sounded a lot lovelier when he said it, but I still think about it years later from time to time. It was the most uniquely sincere compliment I've ever received."

CasualConversation,3e3c27,robustinator,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"Terry Pratchett's books are some of my favorites.  I just finished his Raising Steam last night, actually.  There's a great map that shows the suggested order for reading the books so that you have some prayer of knowing what's going on; there are several ""threads"" of novels, if you will, and they substantially stand alone.  I very much prefer the ""Watch"" and ""Death"" threads over the ""Witches"" and ""Rincewind"" threads.  My favorite of all is Night Watch, and I have a copy that he signed for me at GenCon several years ago.  Technically, Pratchett's Discworld stuff is Fantasy, but what it really is (to me at least) is a satirical look at humanity, which happens to be set in a fantasy world."
CasualConversation,3e3c27,BrokenPaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, the map seems a little intimidating, but it at least gives a place (or 5) to start. Thanks for sharing it, it gets me significantly closer to checking it out. I'm guessing from the threads you like you'd suggest I start with either ""Mort"" or ""Guards! Guards!""?"
CasualConversation,3e3c27,robustinator,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the map can look daunting, but really all it means is to start at the left end of one of the ""threads"" and then work to the right, in order to keep up with the back-references.  Actually, I missed one of the threads that I like: The Industrial Revolution stuff is pretty good (although I don't actually like Moving Pictures, which is the first in that thread; to me, that book is trying too hard to tie into pop culture references.  Soul Music in the ""Death"" thread does the same thing, so I have only read it once; all of the others I've read multiple times.  If I were going to recommend a good starting point for Discworld, it would be Guards! Guards!, but that's because I like the Watch, and the progression of a watchman named Vimes, more than anything else in the whole Discworld canon.  Mort is good, too, I just don't like it as much as some of the others.  If I were going to recommend a trajectory, it would be: Guards! Guards! and Mort (in any order), then  Reaper Man and Men At Arms (in any order), then   Feet of Clay,  The Fifth Elephant, Thief of Time, The Truth,  Night Watch, Monstrous Regiment, Thud!, Going Postal, Making Money, Snuff, Raising Steam in that order.  (The last two aren't on the map I linked.  They come after Making Money in the Industrial Revolution thread.)  Of the whole series, my favorite books are Night Watch and Thief of Time, with Monstrous Regiment and Going Postal close in the running.  As for the Rincewind and Witches threads, I don't like any of them in particular, but reading them in order will of course be beneficial.  The Ancient Civilizations thread is...ok; Pyramids is interesting but not great.  Small Gods actually explores some interesting existential ideas related to divinity and worship, but I feel like it was longer than it needed to be."

A Canticle for Leibowitz is also vaguely scifi-ish, but I think has interest to fans of literature in general.

She is really getting into Steely Dan, Fleetwood Mac and especially Paul Simon. Her favorite song right now is ""Mother and Child Reunion.""  I find I'm a lot more receptive to these artists as I grow older. For instance, I've been enjoying older Elton John a lot lately. Especially the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album. I used to think he was a bit of a caricature. And he's a bit of a cranky old queen now. But I've been accumulating his best material, from about 1971 to 1975, and it's been blowing me away.

And Now For Something Completely Different.  Monty Python are actually a tv series called Monty Python's Flying Circus.  4 Series, 45 episodes in all. Around 30 mins each.  Well worth a watch.

While like shitty lyrics or no lyrics don't really bother me, when a song has really great writing it just tends to make me love it more.

I like music for the music, and if there happens to be good poetry that fits or enhances the tone and feelings of a song, that's great, but they could be talking about nonsense and I would still like the song.   I have a friend who loves Weird Al, and he put on his parody of Poker Face. I was like ""ugh,  dude, Lady Gaga, really?"" And he said ""No, it's Weird Al!"" and started singing along with the silly lyrics. But I don't get it. It's still the same song.

CasualConversation,3e3iaq,ThePulseRifle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"I've done this before, but it wasn't with pizza. There will come a time when she'll know your order without you having to say it. That's when you ask her how her day's going."
CasualConversation,3e3iaq,reydal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, best approach is the up-front one. Next time you see her, keep it short and sweet: ""Hey, I think you're really cool. Would you like to get coffee sometime?""  Practice in your head before hand. Say it over and over and over until it ceases to have meaning and it's just sounds. Then when you see her, just say the sounds. That way you can overcome the nerves.  Then be prepared:   If she says ""Yes,"" ask when's a good time that she's off work, and have a place in mind. If she says ""No,"" be polite, smile, laugh and say ""Alright, no worries. I thought it was worth a shot."" Play it cool, don't come off creepy. Keep coming by for pizza, smile and make it a little inside joke. Best you can do now is try for friends. At least now she knows your face. Maybe she'll change her mind. But DON'T be pushy or a stalker. She might have a boyfriend. If she says ""Maybe"" or ""Let me think about it"" then it's time to casually leave your number on a receipt and hope for the best. This is most likely a rejection though. So stop by the pizza place in a few days, see if she has a reaction. If she avoids you: abort mission. If she's normal, ask if she's thought about it, maybe throw in a joke, or offer something other than a coffee date. If she's still hesitant, let it go bro. She's not into you. If she says ""I don't like coffee"" be prepared with a back-up place in mind, or ask her what she does like. This reaction means two things: 1) She's not into you and subtly trying to say no, OR 2) She's a little oblivious and just said the first thing she thought of because she genuinely doesn't like coffee. Test the waters and try to see which one it is, then follow the steps above.   ...man I plan way too much before dates..."

Also well-fitted jeans and any type of non-sneaker (unless you're like into hip hop inspired ""street-style""). I'm really a jeans, boots, and t-shirt kind of guy; but because everything is relatively fitted, that's enough for people to think I'm relatively ""well dressed"".   edit: all this being said, yeah, I was a scumbag in college.

I'm an incoming 5th year Computer Science student (hopefully) I did not graduate last school year because of some problems like health condition that made me fail subjects, and now, the admin of my college(department) decided to debar me from my college. I feel so bad because I'm 30 units away for me to graduate which is roughly 10 subjects.   Well, I'm still waiting for the confirmation if I can still study at the same university or I should choose another one. I'm fine with it since it's my fault that I didn't put much effort into studying. Hopefully I would graduate 2-3 years from now. :)"

In fact, I did try to give my course my best, but they just can't see it because, duh, my first uni was three hours away from my hometown.

CasualConversation,3e2ppt,YaueV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that. If you love programming, it may not be a bad idea to start building up your portfolio, create some apps/games, etc. while you wait to see how you can complete your degree. I have found that a lot of people have Computer Science degrees but they don't actually have the skills/experience/sample codes to back it up. Some people would come to interviews telling us what courses they took, but as soon as we ask them questions like ""Can you tell us more about this project you did in class?"" or things like ""What was in this database you worked with?"" they go blank."
CasualConversation,3e2ppt,Conny_and_Theo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, that hit me like a truck. I really need to do my portfolio and be motivated and efficient.

CasualConversation,3e2ppt,impossible_planet,3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"I will be a sixth year when the next school year starts. In my case, though, I lost about a year and a half due to poor health, and only returned this previous spring quarter (my fifth year). Had all this not happened I probably would've graduated partway through my fifth year at latest.  For me, when I came back, I just felt like an old man sometimes compared to the other kids. I know the age difference isn't that great, if at all, especially considering the fact that there are probably a few others who are older than the average college student, but it was just this feeling that I didn't belong. I suppose it didn't help that what friends I did make in college have more or less all graduated and moved on with their lives.  I was also afraid that my long absence would kind of halt whatever little momentum I had going on before, but I guess I'm just rebuilding my life in general so, well, gotta do what I gotta do. I got real lucky and managed to find an internship thanks to my godfather at the place he worked, so I guess I'm not too concerned about having something productive/work-related to do at the moment.  I do feel pretty bad wasting my parents money, but I guess there's nothing I can do about it now except try to graduate as fast as I can. I will be dropping one of my majors (was history/international studies major, now am just history), though I'm considering throwing in a minor or two to compensate."
CasualConversation,3e2ppt,moonmanonthesun,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"Being older than my batch mates were one of the facts why I had a hard time making friends. Luckily, I had a classmate who was three years older than me and we clicked very well. She's a second-courser though so it wasn't that ""bad"" for her. It was actually impressive.  Like you, I just see the situation as an opportunity to re-build myself, even though I'm desperate for a new start - like move to a new country but that's jut me being overly ambitious.  To be honest I find history and IS really cool - although I was never compelled to take them, I have friends who do!"
CasualConversation,3e2ppt,moonmanonthesun,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:58 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm three years into an 18-month post-grad course and I'll finish end of this year. None of my classmates I started with are still there, they've all graduated.   To be honest, no-one really cares how long it takes for you to get your degree. Life happens, and life doesn't care for your schedules. The important thing is to finish and to finish as well as you can.   Personally I'm glad that I took my time because it meant I was able to focus better and therefore get decent grades. I was able to enjoy what I was studying, rather than just being constantly burnt out like I did with my undergrad. With my undergrad, I kept taking full-time loads when I shouldn't have and as a result, my undergrad transcript is a train wreck."
CasualConversation,3e2ppt,niggchao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"I wanted to take my time off before I transferred, but my parents didn't allow it, even if I knew inside I really needed a break - I had depression and anxiety during my sophomore year. Jumping off to a new school and a new course was just too overwhelming.   Even these days, I feel the same with my undergrad - a train wreck. I can't give the right amount of effort to all my subjects because I'm always loaded and have trouble balancing. I once had semester schedules that required me being at school for 12 hours. I tend to prioritize my major subjects rather than the minors, which is why my minors often have a near-failing grade. Doesn't really matter to me but I'm quite nervous it can affect my medical school application. Hopefully I'll get a decent amount of break/vacation after I graduate. I need a lot of preparation for what might come after.  Even if my fifth year is a mess, I'm determined that I can still deal with it. You're right, what's important is that I finish this as best as I can!"
CasualConversation,3e2ppt,niggchao,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Currently going into attending my 6th year of a 4 year course. I repeated one year due to bad grades and took one year out because I needed time away from my studies. I should have graduated last year, but I won't until next year at least. I'll be 25 when I do.  There are times when I am self-concious about it. Not because of age or anything, there are students at my university far older than me, but because of things like my ID number being very different to others (the first two numbers of our ID is the year we enrolled). So when people see my ID number, they are immediately aware of how long I have been in university. I feel that hanging over me sometimes.  The truth is though, is that people don't even care. They are so wound up and stressed out with their own studies and lives to even give a moments thought to me in my situation.   Some people breeze through university and college, some people struggle. All that matters in the end is that you come out the other side with what you want. If you've been studying something for years and you realise you no longer want to study it, then that's okay. If you need to take a few more years to get the degree or qualifications you want, then that's okay too. Everybody moves at a different pace to get to where they want to go."
CasualConversation,3e2ppt,niggchao,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"You get me! Self-consciousness is probably the root of why I feel down - when I transferred back to my hometown university, I got some ""judgemental-head-to-toe"" looks from some people I shared the same high school with. They know me as a ""decent"" student back then. And seeing me transfer and get delayed, it was just weird. I felt sick and spent most of my days at the library where I wasn't exposed to a lot of people on the campus.  But I'll take what you said on the last paragraph. That's very insightful. My parents try to remind me the same thing but they often bring up my rough first years in college which scars me easily."
CasualConversation,3e2ppt,niggchao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:46 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear you had a rough time in your first years. University is a very tough environment to find your feet.   There's nothing to be self-conscious about (even though I am self-conscious about these things myself) because you're in university studying something you want to do. You're actually working towards something as opposed to flunking out and doing nothing. You should feel proud that you chose the more difficult route in transferring and spending a few more years studying than taking the easy option of dropping out.

CasualConversation,3dxota,creativeusername93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:16 2015 UTC,"Not super often. I'll upvote super cute stuff that I might want to look at later or things I view as really good responses to the post, but if there's a lot I'm like ehh whatever. I'll also upvote in selling subs or nswf subs for people who have 'zeros' since some people think it's fun to downvote for whatever reason. When the number goes up I'll usually just take the vote away lol because I just voted so that it wouldn't say '0'."
CasualConversation,3dxota,eldergeekprime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:43 2015 UTC,Every second Im on reddit. I love learning and reading tidbits about random things. Also people on here are really funny! They make me laugh out loud (seriously!). I even scroll to the very bottom to read majority of the comments so people dont get left out and I upvote so that people know I read their comment and I liked it. Obviously they wont know its me but still I think it makes them smile. I think. Also I have a lot of time on my hands to do so.

Well, she started wearing clothes that was just... too much. Or didn't fit right. She read a poem at our HS talent show and guys in the first row threw dollar bills at her, it was THAT bad. She also had pretty foul smelling feet, but that didn't stop her from wearing them even when people verbally complained about the smell. Then, she slept with with our mutual friend's long term boyfriend. At a party. While the mutual friend was at the party. In the next room. Her excuse? ""They were on a break."" I've tried reconnecting with her on multiple occasions, but from what I hear, she only hangs out with girls that just tell her what she wants to hear."

CasualConversation,3e11ll,Xanthous_King,5,Tue Jul 21 03:32:58 2015 UTC,"Cutting right to the point!   1) A guy who's too old for me, but has already fallen for me. I have to tell myself no for both our sakes but I'm finding it harder to do lately.  2) Another guy who's within my age range, but just joined the army. I didn't consider him an option before but being at his side through the enlistment process has shown me a whole new side of him. He's going to be a combat engineer and that would be hella stressful on my end. And he's asking about a date. Ugh.  Sorry to vent... not very CC of me."

I'm in high school, he's through college, he feels like a creep. But I like him as a person a lot. We really get each other. Like I said before, it's hard for me to stop myself from falling for him.  2) I'm really not so sure about this one. Combat engineers spend a lot of time at risk. Worrying about someone like that is so hard, I had to watch my parents work through the sane thing. So having a thing with him would involve an eventual LDR and a lot of baggage. But he seems to care for me a lot."

But I'm shallow and talked to her because she's fucking gorgeous.   She should be happy. She can fuck literally anyone she wants. Literally everyone I know wants her. And yet she would call me randomly in the wee hours of the morning for the past two years threatening to kill herself.  Like I said, life's weird like that. She's fucking stupid. Hot, but stupid."

CasualConversation,3e2k04,eatingcannedfood,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:43 2015 UTC,Congrats! I hope I can finish the course someday like you!   I'm stuck in level 3 because I don't have internet access on my phone all the time. I wanted to learn German a long time ago but some people say it's one of the hardest to learn. I just think it's a beautiful language and I wanted to learn it more when I knew that my great-great grandpa was of German heritage (we live in Southeast Asia atm).
CasualConversation,3e2k04,blooqazoo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:29 2015 UTC,You live in Southeast Asia and have German grandpa? What's story behind that? Are you from Singapore?
CasualConversation,3e2k04,Zhangar,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"Philippines. My great2 grandpa was from Germany who traveled to the Philippines with some of his siblings where he married and started a family - I really have no idea what's the story behind why he moved here. I just know we have German blood because some traits are still visible in our family line - lighter skin, taller height and slightly bigger compared to most Filipinos, and some of my relatives from my dad's side have a brown eye color that's comparably brighter than most Asians. I for one, have bigger bone structure and inherited the brown eyes.  Anyway, when the Japanese invaded our country during WWII, my great grandpa decided to change their family name into something that's ""Japanese"" sounding so they wouldn't get captured or executed. It's weird because I knew Germany and Japan were allies during that time, yet the Japs who invaded PH captured or executed anyone who they thought were Americans or basically just Caucasians - they based it on family names and appearances. One of my grandpa's brothers who clearly looked like a Caucasian ended up being captured, with his family not knowing what happened to him after. My grandpa had fair skin even though he was a big man, so he was safe.  I'm not gonna tell what's my current last name, but if it weren't for the Japanse invasion, it would've been Holgen. Not sure if it's a common name in Germany but it sure does sound like one.  Not so interesting, really. Sorry it's quite a long story!  Edit: missing words"

CasualConversation,3e2k04,AnakNgKagang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:44 2015 UTC,I did notice that! Some German words sound almost the same in English (apple = apfel; vasser = water).

Not much. Pocket change.  I kept it though. Kept it as a reminder. The reminder of that stranger I passed on the street.  Here. You can have it back now. It's always belonged to you, anyway."

CasualConversation,3e2i60,marcopennekamp,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"The first time I ""coded"" anything was back in 1992. I was nine years old and just got a Commodore 64. It came with a fat manual I didn't understand (I couldn't speak English at the time) and that manual included code examples. I would type those into the command prompt and the computer would answer something. I've had no idea what I was doing and it was awesome :)  The first time I actually wrote something I understood was six years later in a computer class, where we learned programming in LOGO. Drawing squares was never so fun.  As for tips:   KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid! Multiple short functions are better than few long ones. If you find yourself copy-pasting parts of your code - make a function out of it. If you can see part of your code that could be a function - make it so. Give your functions and variables names that describe what they do. This will make your code clearer and easier to read and understand for that inevitable moment you forget what it was supposed to be doing.  The more complex code you write the more you will feel that some things could be done better. While rewriting and fixing code is generally a good thing it's also important to know when it's time to stop tinkering with it. Pick a naming convention for your variables and functions and stick with it. And don't let anyone bully you into using one you don't like - there are zealots out there who will fight to the death for their favourite notation, it's safer to stay the hell away from them."

You will produce bad code at the beginning, but it will get better if you put in the time. Also don't be afraid to show it to others who are more experienced, a nice person can usually give helpful feedback on your code. But, try not to obsess over quality in the beginning and just make it work. :)  It's a bit like writing, you need to do it to get decent and eventually good."

This might sound weird to say and it'll sound a bit dirty... but the baritone harmony feels better in my mouth. It's hard to describe.  The general rules for what part to sing (at least when starting out)...  If you're a bass, you know it.  If you have choir experience as a tenor, start with tenor.  If you have a good ear, know some music theory, or can sight sing; the baritone is for you.  If you don't have the natural ability of the bass, the experience of the tenor, or the skill of the baritone, they put you in the lead section :P"

With cheap insurance premiums (I believe less than $100 for 6 months) I was happy with having wheels."
CasualConversation,3e1dmt,ricky2234,8,Tue Jul 21 05:17:02 2015 UTC,"First, I would like to say I'm so sorry. I understand how you feel.   I turned 16 in November. Less than a month later, my mom died. She had survived breast cancer a few years ago, but it came back with a vengeance. It was in her brain, lungs, colon, stomach, bones, and so many other places. I have an 8 year old brother and my parents have been separated since I was 3 or 4. Although nobody will ever know exactly what you're feeling, I can probably come close. As someone who's been there, let me tell you the most important thing I learned. Cherish the time you have left. Your dad could have a year, or more, or less. Doctors aren't fortune tellers, and they can't say exactly how things will go. Regardless, find ways to make it memorable. Things are going to get worse, so plan for now. They thought my mom would live for six months to a year, but she ended up having way less time. When she was still doing pretty well, she wanted to plan some vacations for us so we could have some last memorable moments as a family. We couldn't do it because of monetary restrictions. My school counselor told me that if my mom couldn't go to the beach, I could bring the beach to my mom. Her condition had worsened by the time I got that advice, and one of my biggest regrets is that I could never take the beach to her. Even if a vacation or fake vacation isn't quite your family's speed, find something that is. Take lots of pictures. Maybe record him telling you a story about his life or you as a child or something. Talk to him about things you want him to make or write or say or do. Do it sooner rather than later because you never know.   Another important thing to know is that it's okay to cry. There's nothing shameful or weak about it. If that's how you cope, then that's how you cope. It's how most humans cope. No matter what, do not hold it in. Trust me. Cry when you feel like it and don't feel pressured to cry if you don't feel like it. No matter how you're feeling, it's fine. Every person deals with things differently and whether you feel earth-shatteringly sad or not really anything it's fine.   Your dad probably hid the cancer from you because he knew how much it would hurt. I'm not saying it's the right decision. Keep in mind that your dad is only human and he's trying to handle this the best he can. I'm sorry he openly criticized anti-smoking PSAs and told you he was going to be around for a long time when he knew that was probably untrue. That really sucks, and there's no way around it. Like I said, he's human. Try to forgive him, even if it's just a little bit at a time.   Don't hate yourself. Never hate yourself. You are your biggest ally, and you've got to remember that. You're the only one who really knows how you feel and what you think. It's natural to get mad at people you're close to, including your parents. Being terminally ill doesn't make somebody morally perfect, and your dad may have done things to make you hate him in the past. You might secretly resent him for not telling you sooner or for putting you in this situation. It's okay. That's natural. The important thing is to realize that, well, it's not the most important thing. The most important thing is being there for your dad and making your time with him count. Trust me.   If you want to talk beyond this thread, please feel free to message me. Please. I know how important it is to have someone who you can talk to. I've been through this. No detail is too upsetting or horrific for me to handle. If you need me, I'm here. This is going to be one of the hardest things you'll go through, but you'll emerge a stronger person."
CasualConversation,3e1dmt,PossiblePixx,6,Tue Jul 21 06:05:51 2015 UTC,"My mom has stage 4 renal cancer, and what could become lung cancer. She had a kidney removed about a year ago and has been on chemo since.   From what I know, if the next type of chemo they give her doesn't work, there's only one more kind they can give her. If that one doesn't work, she maybe has two years to live. She doesn't even know about all that because she doesn't want to know, my aunt was the one that asked the doctor. She still smokes like a chimney, which doesn't help at all."

CasualConversation,3e1dmt,nealofwgkta,2,Tue Jul 21 09:22:16 2015 UTC,"It may not help to say this and I think that by being there for your father and allowing him to tell you what he's going through, to share that pain and allow himself to be vulnerable and bare is very meaningful. It speaks volumes of how much your dad loves you.  I am so sorry you are going through this. I am thankful that you posted about this and seem willing to talk about this. Does anyone else in your family know? Do you have someone who you can share this with, who can help emotionally support you?   When I was going through cancer one of the most difficult things for me was not feeling comfortable enough to share my feelings, not feeling like I could cry. I am relieved that your father finds you a safe person and it must be a heavy feeling to be witness to his feelings, and to share them.   Please continue talking about this, whatever you feel, whatever is going through your mind is OK to feel. Feeling that you hate yourself, hating certain actions, etc does not cancel out the love you have for him.   Take good care"
CasualConversation,3e1dmt,1egbeard,2,Tue Jul 21 09:26:04 2015 UTC,"Props to you kids being able to deal with this at such a young age. I lost my mother a little over a year and a half ago now and I was only 20. Those last few sentences of yours hit home because I felt the exact same way. I still remember exactly how I felt... I needed to hold myself together until I got back to my dorm and as soon as I stepped into my room I broke. Literally cradling into a ball blocking the doorway in.  I wouldn't wish any of those feelings onto my worst enemy. But you still have some time to make some memorable memories. Looking back now is incredibly bittersweet for me, and although my mother wasn't exactly a role model for me, the best piece of advice I kept from her was ""Don't let anyone take your happiness away"". So that includes her death and my manchild level inability to fully move past it. I don't think I ever will, but as long as I can still function I'll be alright.  You have a community here always ready and willing to talk. If you wanna PM me, feel free.  I don't want to sound insensitive, but due to my own personal experience, I don't like people apologizing to me for hearing about my mothers death. My college picked a fantastic day to send a newsletter to the campus telling everyone that knew me about my mother's death: My birthday. So I got a ton of mixed messages that day and I think I grew a little colder because of it. But also after a while you just don't want to hear people say the same thing over and over again."

The Nolan Batman's were pretty good but I didn't like Man Of Steel. The reason I don't like Marvel movies is that there never seems to be enough consequence or fear of death(on screen) and its like watching an old cartoon where everyone just gets knocked out.

Well, you know, it's not an everyday thing. It didn't work out with the girl as good as I expected, but the experience was very good. You know, being all by yourself, and in a different place, with different people. Even with the girl, it was what I needed to move on."

CasualConversation,3e1pou,generationapathy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:30 2015 UTC,All the time. The trips I like require a certain amount of endurance. I love traveling massive distances in short amounts of time. I usually end up car camping in WalMart parking lots to save time and money. Also there's only sleeping room for me in my VW Golf.
CasualConversation,3e1pou,puttysan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:29:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, last November took a trip to New York City by myself (18) for my birthday. Was awesome, really recommend it. I had a blast, I did whatever I wanted, and my days were never rigid. I just explored and never had a set plan. It was pretty awesome.  Now I'm in Hawaii, I'm a solo traveler here. The only problem I've had so far is that I wanted to do more advanced hikes and haven't been able to do them because it wouldn't be safe alone. But other than that, I've  had a blast. It's been chill.   My next big trip (Iceland) is solo.   I really recommend it. I think you'll learn a lot about yourself when you travel alone. You figure things out for yourself. It's very freeing."

It's THE longest running show on the internet and anyone born in the late 80s and across the 90s that played halo and had access to the internet for sure watched the first couple of seasons. And the current audience for rooster teeth for all of its shows is in the millions including rvb. I personally go back and watch the older seasons regularly. It's hugely popular.

CasualConversation,3e2e6b,girl1232,5,Tue Jul 21 12:51:15 2015 UTC,"All the time :( I know a lot of very wealthy people so my social media is filled with these extensive trips to Japan and that.   My flatmates are both going away; was supposed to go interrailing with them but one bailed to go away with her sister and the other one kept delaying sorting out stuff and then finally told me she's actually going away to see her family instead. Cue me hanging around doing nothing...again.   Not as bad as last year, I applied to so many jobs and heard nothing back so my ego was bruised. This year I had glandular fever so at any point I start to feel sad about doing nothing I remind myself that I genuinely need this time to do nothing to make sure I don't trigger a relapse of ME.   The main things that would happen to me before were that I'd get ""fat and sad"". This year I've started a summer routine filled with stuff, I go out a lot more, and I'm exercising well/eating really well (usually I eat fine at uni and then come home to limited exercise and my family's eating habits - now they're healthy, too!).   My main advice is set little goals for yourself; learn the very basics of a new language (I'm using Duolingo for Norwegian), anything that at the end of summer you'll have worked on and seen am improvement in. Definitely helps me with cabin fever :)"

No way was I going to redo a year! But I'm a perfect storm for a relapse, so I rest as and when necessary. How old were you when you had it?  Facebook envy is a horrible thing. What helped me was realising how others will often feel the same way, and that if you're uploading photos constantly whilst you're away instead of enjoying it it means that they also feel the pressure. Somewhat comforting in a way.  Do it! Any little things are good, especially when you feel like you've done something"

I think I lost weight but it's hard to tell because I swelled up so much I stopped fitting in normal clothes, haha. It's always comforting to find someone else who understands!   Exactly, I think it's just an unfortunate byproduct of the digital age. What helped me was thinking about, truly what would I get out of doing what they did?

Thats a fucking cool turntable though, but do you only have one? Also, your Korg is pretty sweet. I've played on one before, its lots of fun.  Anyways, my music gear is my favourite possessions. I barely have furniture but Ive got a bit of gear.  So firstly, my studio monitors. Cant live without them. Once you're used to the clarity of them you cant go back to normal speakers. I've got the baby monitors though, only 3"". But they're loud and they do the job perfectly. I also own a couple of studio reference earphones, but I hate wearing them so they're just collecting dust.  In my lounge I've got a 1979 Washburn Bass and a newer Ibanez GSR300, the sound system in the lounge is a club style monoblock amp (2x 400w RMS) hooked up to a pair of original TEAC subboxes with 12"" subs, mids and tweaters. Its a power system, way too loud for regular use.  Also there I have a numark DJ controller for the days I want to hook up a laptop and DJ.  Then lastly I have a few random music gear things. Midi keyboard for when I'm producing that I never use, USB soundcard that I use all the time since its better than standard soundcard. etc etc.  These days I very rarely DJ although I produce a lot, so my DJ stuff just gathering dust. I wanna get a pair of CDJ's soon though, then I'll play more."

I only have surround sound speakers (I don't have much room, although I might move soon), and they sound pretty good, but I mostly listen with headphones. AKG K240's. I just use my turntable for listening to records, that's why I only have one. I am a producer, but I never want to use computers, I will always use analog synthesizers (amongst other instruments).   For my next set of speakers, I'll get studio monitors. I never really thought about getting them before."
CasualConversation,3e11cm,Yebi,2,Tue Jul 21 08:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember your nick from the last time we talked about analog vs digital synths.  If you want to get studio monitors and you're worried about small environment/neighbors. Look for near-field monitors.  They're the type that dont really project sound far, but if you're in their cone they sound amazing. the only thing you have to worry about is setting them up properly.   Even though KRK's are often cited, I'd avoid them. They're quite finicky speakers. I went for bottom of the range Samsons and have never had a problem with them. When I upgrade I'm just going to get the slightly bigger pair and then use my existing ones to reference."

I occasionally listen to it to get to sleep, but I usually listen to podcasts.  B) tingles. This is the sensation. When certain sounds happen in the perfect way, sometimes I get tingles along my back. It's kinda like when someone draws on your back with their finger. It starts around your head and the back of your neck and then runs down your spine. It's good :).  For me personally, videos the contain binaural (using both audio channels) and close up trigger me the most. Stuff like close up whispering, mouth sounds, tapping etc.  If you can find your triggers, you can get soooo much out of ASMR :)"

CasualConversation,3e1h4n,ThereIsAThingForThat,2,Tue Jul 21 06:10:20 2015 UTC,"Discovery's great.   Are you a big Daft Punk fan? If you haven't listened to their Alive 2007 album yet, listen to that next. Maybe one of my favorite live albums ever."
CasualConversation,3e1h4n,FreeLook93,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:31 2015 UTC,That and RAM are the only ones I have yet to listen too. I'm puling up Alive 2007 on youtube right now though!

CasualConversation,3e159g,Xyuli,6,Tue Jul 21 03:54:20 2015 UTC,I fell out of my chair today. Atleast you landed painlessly.
CasualConversation,3e159g,spunkyass69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:55:48 2015 UTC,Haha be glad it was just a chair. How'd that happen?
CasualConversation,3e159g,spunkyass69,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:13 2015 UTC,I was slouching and lost my grip when I tried to sit straight.  I really want to sky dive. I found some places in California that charge $400 a person. Is it really that cheap? I always thought it would be in the thousands.
CasualConversation,3e159g,spunkyass69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:08:59 2015 UTC,"Oh no! It could've been worse though.   And yes, even cheaper. I'm in vacation in Hawaii right now and I only paid $162. It's because there's two sky diving companies right next door to each other and they both compete with each other for business, so it's way cheaper than normal."
CasualConversation,3e159g,spunkyass69,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:37 2015 UTC,Well shit. You just talked me into jumping out of a plane. Lol.  Hopefully I'll get it done by next year.
CasualConversation,3e159g,spunkyass69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:50 2015 UTC,YES! You have to do it. Trust me. It's a feeling like no other. And the view is spectacular. Why can't you just do it now? Tomorrow? This weekend? Two weeks from now? Why not as soon as you can?
CasualConversation,3e159g,PossiblePixx,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:25 2015 UTC,I could next month if I convince my friends to do it for my friend's bachelor party. It could be a surprise for the Groom!
CasualConversation,3e159g,PossiblePixx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"You definitely could. Or if that doesn't work out, just go yourself. Get it done! :)"
CasualConversation,3e159g,PossiblePixx,2,Tue Jul 21 04:41:22 2015 UTC,Nope. I need a friend to scream with me on the way down. Emotional support.
CasualConversation,3e159g,PossiblePixx,2,Tue Jul 21 04:45:15 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't hear them anyways. And you probably wouldn't see them. When I jumped I didn't see anyone else in my group. If you do tandem, you'll have the support of the instructor!"
CasualConversation,3e159g,PossiblePixx,2,Tue Jul 21 04:48:08 2015 UTC,I commend you for having that kind of courage. Hopefully your new outlook sticks because that's an amazing way to live your life. Have you considered posting in /r/CasualIAmA? I think you'd probably get some stellar questions.  What was the best and worst part?
CasualConversation,3e159g,InconspicuouShark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:53:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words!   Well, I don't feel THAT different. I've done a lot of growing up lately. I think it just helped me realize that the things I worry about everyday don't really matter. I mean, falling like that, and looking at the coast and the mountains and the world in front of me, made me think how free and irrelevant everything really is. How can I be scared of anything small again when I've conquered (and overcame, I think officially) my biggest fear - heights? It reminded me of my thirst for adventure.   I think my favourite part was just that moment right before I jumped. When I was at the door of the airplane, and I kind of had that ""oh holy Jesus Christ oh my god"" and then BAM! It just happened. It felt so insanely free and unrestricted.   Perhaps I will. Thanks for your suggestion :)  Edit: as for the worst part, when the parachute opens you DEFINITELY feel it! It jolts you back and you feel it very much on the harness on your thighs. If I were a guy I would probably have not enjoyed that part one bit."
CasualConversation,3e159g,InconspicuouShark,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's good for all of us to realize that sometimes. What was the most beautiful thing you saw up there? The logistics of skydiving confuse me a little, is it possible to run into a bird...? That would be scary.   I can't even imagine. I would probably start crying and shaking my head insanely. Is there anything you want to do next?"
CasualConversation,3e159g,InconspicuouShark,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man! I'm in Hawaii right now and I skydived at North Shore. So basically, I had the ocean and coral reef and the mountains and nature and so I can't say what was the most beautiful because it was ALL spectacular.   And no, I don't think so because I was 14,000 feet up and birds don't fly that high. And it's at an airfield so I doubt birds really want to fly in those paths. Plus they'd probably see you coming anyways, because you're not really moving at a lightning speed.   And don't worry, a few years ago I would've never believed I would sky dive. But you just have to be ready to face it. It's scarier in your head than in reality. It's only scary when you're at the door. When you're falling, it's calm and nice and unbelievable."
CasualConversation,3e159g,InconspicuouShark,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. That seems like a glorious experience.  Haha, okay, that makes sense. Thanks for dignifying my silly question with an answer!  I think the feeling of falling seems amazing. It's just the jumping and the landing. And, okay, it's a little bit the falling too."
CasualConversation,3e159g,Baby_venomm,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:54 2015 UTC,"It's such a good experience. If you can convince yourself to do it, please do. I swear you won't regret it. And you'll probably earn some street cred. The entire thing was pretty amazing. Honestly, I wish I was more scared. But when I was in that plane, when I saw what I was gonna do, I smiled and I looked forward to it. It wasn't scary. If I was scared, there would've been more adrenaline. It would've been 10x better id say.   I seriously want to do it again haha"
CasualConversation,3e159g,Baby_venomm,2,Tue Jul 21 06:14:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe I will someday. I at least want to do some sort of indoor arena skydiving program. So much street cred! Nononono, I don't like how adrenaline feels. It makes me too jumpy. like I'm constantly on edge.   I bet you'd have a really different experience the next time you do it. Take in different things and all."
CasualConversation,3e159g,Baby_venomm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:25:42 2015 UTC,"Really? You don't like adrenaline? I wish I could feel it more. So often I don't feel anything. I wish I could feel more alive, and I guess adrenaline pumps some of that back into me.   Oh yeah, for sure. Next time I do I'll have to be back home, and the view is VERY different, but I'm sure just as amazing!"
CasualConversation,3e159g,Baby_venomm,2,Tue Jul 21 06:38:07 2015 UTC,"Not feeling anything is awful. I can see where adrenaline would make you feel great, especially after so much nothingness.  Maybe you can make a point to skydive in a bunch of different places? That might not be practical, but it would be cool."
CasualConversation,3e159g,Baby_venomm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:16 2015 UTC,"It's not awful... its just not anything. It's not like I'm sad, I'm just most of the time apathetic. I'd said I'm very content with my life though and I don't have a problem with feeling like this. But I wish I could feel more because I would kill for the kind of emotional rush that some people seem to get that I just... don't. I feel like I am too logical sometimes.   Yes. I actually have a trip to Chicago coming up, and when I'm back home. So that's two potential different areas I could skydive. Then in October I'm in Iceland, and I don't think I can skydive there, but WHO KNOWS?! That would be killer though."

CasualConversation,3e0n1t,Olierien,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:32 2015 UTC,"I had a fight with my boyfriend last night. We've been dating since late February, and were friends before that. We said ""I love you"" pretty quickly and had been discussing how we'd get all his stuff into my house, and if I could go with him if his company transferred him. He stays with me all weekend, and usually a few nights during the week, has clothes at my place, we grocery shop together, etc. Last night, I wanted to discuss moving in more seriously - when it was going to happen, what things we'd need to do beforehand. Turns out he doesn't want to move in now, and doesn't apparently know when he wants to move in together at all.  I was really crushed because he practically lives with me now already. In all the time it had been talked about, he never told me ""not yet"" or ""this isn't a step I want to take right now"". I thought this was something that he wanted to do too, but I was wrong. So, I told him I didn't want him to leave his clothes and everything at my house. I drove him back to his own place because I was just totally crushed. Haven't spoken to him today, and last night he didn't understand what he'd done to upset me. I'm not even sure if what I did was right, but I stayed calm despite the crying."

We said ""I love you"" to each other a month and a half later (seriously not joking about how similar our relationships are).  The fight happened because she is extremely stressed out about college and her test tomorrow. The thing is that we are pretty damn happy together until she has to take a test. Then, she freaks out and tries to start a fight with me. I wish I could figure out how to help her study but I keep failing. I'm starting to think that we just shouldn't live in the same apartment. I think she needs a friend more than a partner right now in her life."

I wrung them out and tried to dry them in the dryer, but ended up having to bring them to a laundromat to have them washed professionally and pay 10 times the amount I usually pay to wash clothes. There are no other machines available here and I couldn't wait for the machine to be fixed because I'm in a tropical climate, and they would've molded if I left them sit around wet.

Total War is different to the first two, in that the battles are simulated much better, but (imo) the level of strategy outside of battles are much more limited.  I'd recommend watching some videos on the games first, though, since the first two require a bit of DLC to get everything out of them."

If some people knew I played a few hours a Minecraft a day, they would start labeling me an addict. However, if I have everything else going right for me and it isn't bothering anyone, then why should I stop what I enjoy doing? Some people build fucking model trains and it consumes their life. Have you ever been to a model train convention? Those are the happiest fuckers on the planet.  The most hilarious thing I hear from people is that people that enjoy  anything PC related that they are, ""wasting their life"" but then, the same person, will sit down and binge watch reality TV shows.   The point is, there are some questions you need to start asking yourself:  1) Is being on the PC actually causing damage to your life? For instance, are you buying in-app purchases from your favorite MMO to the point where it's taken a huge toll on your finances?   2) Are you and your wife's interests that different, that she is demanding you get away from what YOU enjoy?  3) Are you looking at this objectively or through your emotions for your wife?  The most important thing here is that, ""Do you want to do it for yourself or are you being lead to do it because of your wife?"" Yes, love and sacrifice is important to a relationship but when you start sacrificing what you enjoy doing, you risk the very relationship itself.   If you do have a problem, then the problem isn't the PC. It's your moderation and impulse control. Look into mindfulness mediation, it has some merit and would be beneficial to you."

I mean, spending 6 hours in a heated debate about the plausibility of the physics behind stargates is quite a good one, but it's not worthy of being #1. Dressing up as the Tenth Doctor for the cinema showing of the Doctor Who 50th anniversary special doesn't quite cut it either. I did once spend the entirety of New Year's Eve playing The Settlers of Catan with friends, continuing well into the following morning, but come on- that's not even role playing (other years, we've done movie marathons with extended versions of LotR, which is just brilliant). Recently, I ended up spending the better part of a day discussing the life cycle and reproductive habits of Tolkien's elves with someone I had never met before (the nature of elven beards is particularly fascinating).   I could go on and on, but nothing in particular stands out as the single most nerdy thing :/"

Our teams had weekly meetings throughout the school year consulting with engineering, physics and biochem students to improve our chugging devices, determine the best temperature to chug water and a variety of beers, study tape (and movies like Beerfest), chugging technique, and improving our training practices.

CasualConversation,3e2f0w,Yinyeer,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:43 2015 UTC,"That was one of my thoughts, but it doesn't seem to be much of a concern here. I don't have a weak immune system but I've been sick most of the time I've been here, probably because of that. One of us gets sick, gives it to everyone, then another one remains sick for longer, re-distributes the virus around, and repeat.  I don't know when I am allowed to stay in my room due to sickness. The parents do it (when sick they stay home and I look after the child), but I don't know if my symptoms are as strong as theirs, though we do share the same symptoms since we share the same sicknesses all the time. They don't seem bothered when I'm sick, so whatever. If I were to stay in my room every time I'm sick, I would have seen the child only like three times.   Sometimes I wonder if it's because they're German and I'm North American? Germans are so into health and taking pills and going to the doctor and resting, while in North America, unless you're dead, you're just a lazy bum if you call-in sick."

I have mild depression and anxiety with a hint of OCD (so it is something to watch per se but not serious enough that, say, I'm suicidal or need medication or anything).  Anyways, the first round of therapy I had helped sort out the issues I was having with my parents' relationship, which was very shaky for a while (it's better now, maybe partly because my parents realized the effect they were having on me and my brother). I stopped going to therapy for almost two years for various reasons, and have started again with a different therapist recently now as I'm rebuilding my life after my physical health took a nosedive. At the moment, now that I've taken care of the issues I had with my parents, I'm trying to work on building up self-esteem and just become more normal again.  A lot of times the counselor will tell me obvious things. But that's fine, because sometimes it's much easier to digest if a relative stranger tells you, rather than yourself or someone you know well. A lot of times my talks with the counselor will just seem like random talks that I could have with anybody I'm acquainted with. But that's fine too, sometimes it helps get me thinking about things. And sometimes my counselor will suggest doing things just a bit outside my comfort zone. And that is, also, quite fine, because that's just what I have to do (but ideally small steps, baby steps, as my first counselor told me).  Of course, I assume that therapy doesn't always turn out great for everyone. Don't be afraid to switch to a different therapist if possible, and don't be afraid to tell your therapist which issues you would like to sort through."

This was a big hurdle for me to overcome as someone who comes from more or less an upper-middle class well-educated background, and really why I only came for help months if not years after I should have. The way I thought of it is that if someone gets their hand cuts off, should they just shrug it off and say ""well, it's not as bad as some guy who lose all four limbs, so I guess I'm not justified in complaining"" or should they get to the damn hospital as fast as they can and seek treatment?

You need to make sure that your therapist and yourself have good chemistry. That this person, who you're going to pay a lot of money, is going to actually be able to help you. The first might not be the best, and I've experienced that personally. You need someone who can challenge you, and not simply sit and listen with a box of kleenex at hand and a lot of good intentions.   Secondly, you must want to do this. Otherwise there is no point at all. Be open about new ways of thinking and operating during your daily tasks and routines - because your current ones aren't working.   Also - you are where you are now. You can't do anything about what has already happened before. The past is untouchable. You need to be able to do things right now, because now is the only time we as humans can be productive - because even the near future is only a guess. Be you, be good to yourself, do this, do this now, and be patient. It'll work out, and you will be massively rewarded in the end."

CasualConversation,3e0y6c,1egbeard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:27:45 2015 UTC,"As a future therapist who's been a client also, let me see if I can give you a few things to help:  So, the research suggests by and large that the main factor for therapeutic process is the relationship with the therapist itself (I can find sources if you'd like, I've read it many different places.) So with that in mind, chemistry is very important. It'll take some time to feel out the therapist, their style and so on, but if you leave sessions feeling frustrated (as I have with some therapists) that's a sign maybe to seek other services.  While that can be a really important indicator, there's a few that are also important based on my own observations. Individual therapy was REALLY hard for me when I was stuck in a rut. I had a lot of issues that I needed to work through that were best for a group setting.  While I didn't go to a group therapy session, the group I did attend had many therapeutic elements that helped me get to the spot I needed to be in. Off the top of my head, the big elements I needed were catharsis and universality (being able to let out what I felt, and also to realize that I wasn't alone and was accepted and loved.)  Some people like myself shine in group, some work better one on one. If you're not sure which one you are, then try both if you're able.  Once I had that powerful group experience that helped me with many different things, individual sessions are way more productive because my own self awareness and motivation to take action has changed drastically.   Like I said, many therapists have different styles. My most recent one was more...engaged, I guess, in the dialogue. Our sessions felt more like a conversation. That has its perks and drawbacks. On the one hand, I can see someone who's never done counseling before being very relaxed at the informal tone of the sessions, but for me, it was also frustrating at times.   One of my former therapists said I had a phenomenon that was called ""Heal thyself"" where I could go into a session and talk my way to an answer. All I needed was a sound board and a few probing questions. So for me, the conversational style was like pumping the brakes a bit. Maybe that's what I needed. Who knows?  I think the bottom line is that there's lots of factors in play on what determines a successful therapy experience. Ultimately it comes from you being the driver of your journey, not them. You guide the sessions, you set the goals, you do all of that and they just provide you with different alternative directions. It seems like you know that already, so that's good.   Let's see....I think that's all I got. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!"

I'm in Australia, so  it was kind of a thrill!   I'm sorry to hear about your depression. I get that too and am on permanent medication which has helped a huge amount.  I hope you can find wellness and happiness. And please consider staying, even if just for this subreddit."

I read your post on /r/depression and I really wish I had something I could tell you that would help, even by the most minute amount but I don't think I do.  My best friend has some similar social issues and a similar outlook on things, albeit for different reasons, and I can't even help him. I've known him for about 15 years and I probably know him better than his own family does but I still can't help him out his depression.  I guess just know that there was at least one person on CC that enjoyed your presence here and that you will be missed."

I definitely know the lonely feelings. You can always complain about stuff in a message and I'd be happy to be a good bud.   I've also been the target of Internet thug people... a lot of them. That pressure can make you feel worse than actual, physical bullying. At the time I kinda wish someone would just punch me so it'd be over.  Anyway yeah. Let's be friends if it helps."

This place is a shit hole 90% filled with ""I am so smart and right and everyone else is wrong"" kinda people, and a 10% or less nice people.  Say anything that goes against the hivemind, and you are automatically downvoted to oblivion, even if its a perfecly valid/good argument.  The circle jerk is extremely stong here in reddit. Even on the most serious of the topics, the comment section is a chaos (and then they dare to talk shit about the youtube comment section)  Overused jokes. Tips fedora, tipping intensifies, So much of THIS, someone give this guy gold, you sir deserve more upvotes, you magnificent bastard, it sucks that I can only upvote you once, and long chains of replys changing a little bit of that the first one says, for example:  > Its the same  >> It is sane  >>> Who's name?  >>>>Mayday  >>>>>Humpday  >>>>>>Combo breaker  >>>>>>>I laughed way too hard at this.  TLDR; Leave this place, its the best decision you can make. There are some good subreddits, but in my opinion, the site as a whole sucks because the circlejerking and the closed minded nature.  Edit: This subreddit is an extremely rare exception and its being contaminated lately a little bit because its growing so much."

CasualConversation,3dyjy2,TSPhoenix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:22 2015 UTC,"Hey bunny, hope you are still here to catch this post as you were one of the contributors here that I liked so I think I owe you to say what I really think.  I read through your /r/depression post and I very much get the impression you are the sort of person I used to be, where if something went sour your solution is to cut it off and never look back.  Leaving places of unhappiness is not the same as searching for a place of happiness. Your happiness has to come from within, and only then will your surroundings bring you happiness. /u/daaraa is right in that the only way thing will get better is if you come to terms with what you want from life and make steps towards that.  I'm not accusing you of running, if you want to move to the countryside and live on a hobby farm with your husband by all means do so, but only if that is what would make you happy, don't do it to escape from the world because you can't escape from the world, you live in it even if you feel you don't belong in it.   I just feel like i don't belong anywhere.   Because in all likelihood you don't, the world is made for ""normal"" people and weirdos like you and I don't really have comfortable place within it. We have to carve out our own special place.  My advice is take a good long break from reddit, but don't run from it. Never coming back and never knowing why you didn't fit in isn't going to help you at all. Give yourself space, but don't waste three years of growth by closing your eyes even if it hurts.  It is often questions that hurt to ask so much that you can't get the words out that are the ones you need to ask the most. But please do ask them, don't wind up on your deathbed still wondering why life was so miserable."

I literally just ran across my huge garbage bag full of tribbles that I sewed for my Star Trek themed Halloween party last October. heh Each tribble took about 1.5-3 hours to sew by hand and I have an absurd volume of them after asking folks at the party to take home as many as they wanted. Unfortunately I have no idea what to do with the remainder but point is, we created and/or collected a huge amount of Star Trek items for this party (and still have the LCARS overlay my roommate made on the microwave as well as the various signs on all the doors in the hallway hehe) and I love having it all on display. It's particularly amusing when folks want to use the microwave and inquire which button should be used (""Engage!"" is the start button while ""Self Destruct"" is the timer function, for the record).  Hopefully you'll be able to find awesome people who will agree that your collection is awesome and you wont need to feel any embarrassment over it anymore. :)"

I told them that listening to carefree shit like that helps to take away my stress, y'know?  If they judged me negatively based off of that, then fuck 'em.

CasualConversation,3dzoqr,reptasmic,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:16 2015 UTC,"Uh oh, you said the magic words and now I'm going to talk your ear off...  Man, it would be awesome to be able to transcribe into another language. I do a lot of podcasts, I think that kind of conversational language would be so rad to try in another language.  Anyway, if you decide you do want to get into it, get this free software. You don't want to use a regular word processor, with transcription software you are able to speed up/slow down the audio and create hot keys for start/stop and FF/rewind etc. It's pretty crucial that you don't stop the flow of your typing to switch back and forth between your audio player and your word processor."

There's the prejudice that only pre-teens watch Let's Plays and since I spend so much time for it, it's a bit embarrassing.  I also like to translate/subtitle documentaries etc. on youtube sometimes.

CasualConversation,3e1gt7,HarrisonFordFocus,2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, possibly. I change my mind about a lot of things often (like my favorite color :P), so it could very well be possible."

CasualConversation,3e1gt7,HarrisonFordFocus,2,Tue Jul 21 05:58:49 2015 UTC,"Long story short, my family got a fridge from someone who is moving, and we kept that fridge in the garage before we found a time (today) to move it into the house, so basically we were just switching the places of the old and new fridge.  Favorite book..... I really like Robopocalypse by Daniel H. Wilson, but Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a good one too. If graphic novels/ comics count, then it would be Maus, by Art Spiegelman."
CasualConversation,3e1gt7,jayriley,2,Tue Jul 21 06:01:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, the ol' fridge switcharoo. I've done that before.  Big science fiction fan I take it? My buddy's grandfather used to write sci-fi novels, they have a bunch of his book covers framed in the basement of his house. Wish I could remember any of the titles."
CasualConversation,3e1gt7,jayriley,2,Tue Jul 21 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"I love some sci-fi. I've been reading a lot of nonfiction lately. A few books on the evolution and media significance of video games (like Extra Lives or Reality is Broken), a book about reading body language, and Columbine, which is about the Columbine shootings."
CasualConversation,3e1gt7,jayriley,2,Tue Jul 21 06:12:44 2015 UTC,"Columbine is something that intrigues the hell out of me, but something I try to avoid looking up. Generally if I think about it too long, I just get upset thinking about how sad/fucked up it really is for everyone involved."
CasualConversation,3e1gt7,FloodedDistrict,2,Tue Jul 21 06:21:30 2015 UTC,"That happened to me yesterday when I was reading up on Elliot Rodger. His story was actually kind of tragic. Naturally he shouldn't have acted the way he did, but his life was actually pretty shitty, at least from the way he described it.  What's also depressing about that case is that the murders possibly could have been prevented."
CasualConversation,3e1gt7,FloodedDistrict,2,Tue Jul 21 06:24:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, the whole thing could've been prevented if people took action/weren't terrible to start with. It's heartbreaking."

I think that's doable :)  Pm me and we can get this show on the road :)"
CasualConversation,3e27i0,Wilddogette,2,Tue Jul 21 11:55:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, I love snail mail! I've had quite a few pen pals and even though I can't give you specific advice, I hope that some general things will be helpful too. First of all, handwritten letters are amazingly beautiful! Even if your handwritting is sloppy, do put in the effort and write the letter yourself instead of printing it - it is much more personal and it shows that you're really trying. Also, do not use fancy paper, get a plain white sheet and get creative with it! I once received a letter in which the person had ruled off the lines by hand, and even though it was not very orderly I found it a really sweet. Draw some small things that you know she enjoys on the sheet, like her favorite flower, a small drawing of her favorite TV/movie character, a cute animal. For example, I love Adventure Time and a friend of mine had drawn a cartoon me in AT style. Now, he was not a good painter by any means and the drawing didn't look particularly pretty either, but it was immensely touching and a refreshing change from the usual 'fancy' pink paper with some printed roses on it. Another nice touch could be putting something small in the envelope which she wouldn't expect since you've agreed on no gifts. It doesn't need to be big or expensive, it could be that old four-leaf clover that you still keep for no reason, or one of those small tattoos that you find in gums (don't know if you have these in your country), or a small treat (no chocolate or anything that would melt though!). Go through your conversations and find/think of all little things that she doesn't mention very often but genuinely likes - it will really move her that you've remembered and you've put in the effort to materialise them and put them in a letter. Finally, make sure you don't exhaust all options on the first letter! Surely it needs to be really good, but you have to keep the standard with the next letters as well so do not do everything at once.  I'm not too sure if this was helpful and you probably thought of all of these things alraedy, but hopefully you found at least one thing that inspired a great idea that would impress your friend. It is a really kind thing to do, I hope it works out well! Oh, and I'd love to hear how it all went so please do PM me once you get working. Good luck!"
CasualConversation,3e27i0,dropout-eloise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! Seriously, this helped a lot! I really love the idea with the small tattoos! I remember those from when I was a kid, but I have no ideas if they are still around, but I am planning on checking as soon as I am done writing this comment. I will try to think of one or more trinkets. For example, she likes when I show her some music, perhaps I could include a code to an album? I don't know if you know, but whenever you buy a vinyl, usually there comes along a download link for the album; would this be alright to include in the letter? Furthermore, I went back to our conversation and found a thing she likes, but doesn't mention much (at least I think so) and I am pretty sure I can draw it decently!    I cannot highlight how much this means to me! You've got some awesome ideas, thank you so much!"
CasualConversation,3e27i0,dropout-eloise,2,Tue Jul 21 12:33:36 2015 UTC,"I'm thrilled I helped! You are more than welcome!  The code to an album sounds like an amazing idea! I think it's a great thing to include in the letter - it adds an element of surpirse and will sure keep her eager to find out what it is (and since it is something that she enjoys receiving, she will be very pleased afterwards). Also, good job for finding this thing she likes which you can draw!  What you're trying to do is truly admirable though! All the effort, consideration and enthusiasm you're putting into this is very impressive on its own and I'm sure she'll be able to feel it through the letter - this is the beauty of snail mail! Once again, you are welcome and feel free to ask if you have any other ideas that you're unsure about."
CasualConversation,3e27i0,harcole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words! I have to tell you; as soon as I grabbed some gum I knew had tattoos, I got some ideas for the letter based on what you wrote; how I could use the tattoos in a running joke, how I could implement her favourite book, etc. I got so many ideas, and sadly forgot my notebook, that I ran all the way back to my place while reciting the ideas. I didn't forget any and I was sweating so badly in this heat that I had to shower, hahaha!    I am really getting to a point where I am getting confident in doing this! :D"

I find it to be one of the most involving art forms as it makes you work for it. Putting in the effort gives the fruits of your labour. I also find that literature is similar (you have to put in the effort to imagine what is being described, even if you are having your hand held through it) but videogames are surprisingly effective in their art form. I have always said, however, that the more senses an art form uses the more diluted the art form becomes - so literature is at the top (I'm quite passionate about literature, too, so I tend to say it is the purest art form), music and visual art are just below it and videogames, TV and film are just below that. And not every game is a piece of art, or not a good one. But when you get a truly artistic game it can be better than any film, any song, any painting. I just wish the world would see this instead of seeing videogames as ""nerdy"" and ""making us violent"" or what other stuff they say, because they truly are a piece of art."

I'll be using the meat for various gourmet and home-cooked meals throughout the year. I will hold back 4-6 of the nicest birds as breeders, though, to produce next year's crop.  A brooder is basically where they are raised from chicks to young juveniles. It can be anything that can contain them, i.e. a rabbit cage, cardboard box, or plastic bin, and is kept heated by a heating pad, red lamp, or ceramic reptile heater. Once they're feathered well enough to independently maintain a steady body temperature (around 6-8 weeks), they'll be sent outside to a growing pen."

I can go ham on the recorder, too. I'm also a tenor/bass. I reaaaally wanna learn to play the accordion. It sounds like a fun af instrument to learn."
CasualConversation,3e06z3,hawaii_sunset,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:13 2015 UTC,"It's a hoot and there is no standing still when an accordion takes the floor. My friend Julia and I were at the diplomat's ball our freshman year in college and it was held at the library of Congress.  Well, a guy with an accordion gets on the floor and starts a polka so all the college kids clear out. Not Julia and I, though, we tan out and polka'd around the whole floor. It was the best thing ever. Accordions are awesome."

CasualConversation,3e06z3,nickachu_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:29:14 2015 UTC,Have a funnel cake for me! Also go pet an animal for me. I hear 4h hangs out at those things.

CasualConversation,3e06z3,nickachu_,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:19 2015 UTC,I totally know the feeling. I can track different times in my life based on TV shows. Do you have any other shows up on the docket?
CasualConversation,3e06z3,TommyTeaMorrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yes!! Well now that I've finished The Office, I'll probably try to go back and finish Monk and Heroes (both a few years old) and during the fall Modern Family and The Mindy Project are my usuals! Lol I wonder just how much time I spend watching tv. How about you?"
CasualConversation,3e06z3,TommyTeaMorrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:32 2015 UTC,"I go through phases. First action, then Sci fi, then fantasy, then anime. I'm on an anime kick right now. Black butler and Gargantia On The Verduous Planet are my currents... and cause  I am lame I'm watching the K drama version of Itazura Na Kiss.   But before this was Star Trek and Far Scape."
CasualConversation,3e06z3,TommyTeaMorrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"Ahaha I haven't heard of any of those shows! But sci fi isn't my thing, except for a few books like Ender's Game. Okay obviously I've watched Star Trek, cuz my parents are such Trekkies, but other than that haven't heard of those."
CasualConversation,3e06z3,TommyTeaMorrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:47 2015 UTC,Omg I love that show. Can rematch it anytime. Have you watch Parks n Rec yet?
CasualConversation,3e06z3,beta_eight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:18 2015 UTC,"Yes!! I actually watched that while it was airing. That's one of my favorite shows of all time, along with The Office."
CasualConversation,3e06z3,IWouldUnderstand,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:47 2015 UTC,Hung out with /u/azothian we're watching DS9

CasualConversation,3e06z3,Sryden42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:14:41 2015 UTC,Ooh what kind? Is it a blend or straight? Did you make it yourself?
CasualConversation,3e06z3,Sryden42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:28:03 2015 UTC,"It would fall under the puerh category although its a bit more unique, but it is just straight all camellia sinensus material and nothing else. I bought it at a local shop and it was a bit pricey but after trying it I'd have to say its worth it."
CasualConversation,3e06z3,Sovereignty_R,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:19 2015 UTC,"Oh man, do you have one of those fancy teapots for it? An old roommate of mine used to make the BEST tea. It had a little automated basket and a digital readout that heated the water to precise temps. This way tea steeped for the perfect time. I have never had a puerh tea. Do you drink it with anything?"
CasualConversation,3e06z3,Sovereignty_R,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:13 2015 UTC,Well I use more simple teaware some of it is antique and I also had my eye on a ming tea bowl that was around $400 which is a good price.   But well  have a temperature control kettle that I use to get the right temperature. Pu'erh uses boiling water so its easy to make and its one of the stronger and more flavorful teas so it really doesn't need anything added to it. But I make it really strong in small amounts and I drink it all day.
CasualConversation,3e06z3,koryisma,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:12 2015 UTC,"Is there a beginner tea you'd recommend for broadening palette? I like fruit teas, rooibos, black tea, and some green. I also love tart flavors."
CasualConversation,3e06z3,koryisma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:34 2015 UTC,Well I'd say some sort of oolong would definitely be a good idea its  huge category with some interesting flavors.   Well especially most Wuyi Mountain oolongs they are are twisted and dark leaves and they have a very interesting rock sort of bitter/tartness that I find its really unique.
CasualConversation,3e06z3,koryisma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:51 2015 UTC,Thanks! I will save this for later!
