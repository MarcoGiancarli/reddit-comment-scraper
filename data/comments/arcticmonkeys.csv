arcticmonkeys,3e4bv4,pine_apples,14,Wed Jul 22 01:50:15 2015 UTC,Sorry but what does this mean for someone who doesn't go on that forum?
arcticmonkeys,3e4bv4,Gre3nArr0w,22,Tue Jul 21 21:32:48 2015 UTC,"Blake is owner/admin of AMUS and has been since its inception, he has followed AM around on many a tour and has gotten to know members of the management (and even the guys themselves to an extent) so he gets lots of titbits of info before anyone else. You can trust him."
arcticmonkeys,3e4bv4,Spitfire221,5,Tue Jul 21 21:51:54 2015 UTC,Wow that's awesome! Thanks for informing me!
arcticmonkeys,3e4bv4,Gre3nArr0w,12,Tue Jul 21 21:55:02 2015 UTC,It means they will bring a new album out some time next year.
arcticmonkeys,3e4bv4,MattN92,16,Tue Jul 21 21:39:22 2015 UTC,What credibility does Blake have? Sorry I just am wondering if it's legit or a fan or something.
arcticmonkeys,3e4bv4,Gre3nArr0w,13,Tue Jul 21 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"Enough that if he says that's the plan, and puts it publicly on twitter, I would 100% believe it. He runs the fan site, he's met them all countless times, he's got inside sources."

arcticmonkeys,3e1leu,juponeter,5,Tue Jul 21 07:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'd expect the next tour details to come along with details of the next album. Considering AM's success, and what Alex has said so far, i don't see this coming to fruition any time soon.   I'd suggest following all of your outlets (Bands in town, Facebook RSS, Arctic Monkeys official fan page) so you can be as up-to-date as possible.

They seemed happy enough to take it, but it still would be awkward in the anticipation going up to them, since a lot of celebrities don't like this kind of stuff.  I guess that's what makes them so cool."

arcticmonkeys,3dx64i,greatestape,3,Mon Jul 20 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, all the guys do, and have done since around 2013.  EDIT: Actually probably more like 2012, as they moved out there just as they started recording AM."
arcticmonkeys,3dx64i,SnapbackYamaka,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:57 2015 UTC,Alex said one of the big reasons for moving out there was being able to ride his motorcycle all year round
arcticmonkeys,3dx64i,remitroamer,2,Mon Jul 20 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"I'd never want to be famous, but I'm totally envious of the luxuries that come with it. How cool would it be to just be capable of deciding to move anywhere in the world whenever you feel like it?"
arcticmonkeys,3dx64i,arcticmankeys,3,Mon Jul 20 23:22:27 2015 UTC,"I guess it isn't so much being famous as much as being rich. If I was rich I'd travel a fuck ton and probably have a couple vacation houses in my favorite destinations. Fuck, that would be the life."
arcticmonkeys,3dx64i,0utshined,2,Mon Jul 20 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and the tax rate in England is very high. It is quite common for musicians to emigrate once they start making the big bucks, and LA is an easy choice given the culture and proximity to recording industry. Kinda like when U2 make songs about how poor Ireland is, but they live abroad so they don't have to pay Irish taxes."

arcticmonkeys,3do4l1,SausageBarm,4,Fri Jul 17 23:10:09 2015 UTC,Curious guitar player here. Does the quality of drumsticks really affect playing ability? I could undestand weight being a factor but not much else.
arcticmonkeys,3do4l1,xRedDevilx,14,Sat Jul 18 05:03:19 2015 UTC,"Like choosing different picks, personal preference mostly."
arcticmonkeys,3do4l1,gordonderp,4,Sat Jul 18 09:40:19 2015 UTC,"Quality can affect playing ability, yeah. Cheap sticks are often poorly weighted and have an off balancing point meaning you end up getting less natural bounce from the stick/doing most of the work to compensate, taking more energy and causing more pain.  Usually though, different sticks are just for different styles and personal preference like /u/gordonderp said. Lighter sticks for speed players, heavy sticks for hard-hitters, the old 'nylon tip vs. wood tip' discussion, etc."

arcticmonkeys,3d9i97,moiadipshit,5,Thu Jul 16 00:34:41 2015 UTC,I LOVE The Blond O Sonic Shimmer trap. Lyrics wise I thought that was a really great insight into where AM was going with all the references to Cadillacs and tempestuous women characters. It's nice to think Alex was forming that James Dean type of look/character during those sessions. As for early B-Sides I really like Settle For A Draw  - it's got something about it that sounds like nothing else at around then. Also '7' is a stormer from that time. There's a gig they did that was on Radio1 when they were first playing Favourite Worst Nightmare and they used 'If You Found This You're Probably Too Late' as an opener before they went into Brianstorm. That always sounded fucking cool to me.   EDIT: spelling
arcticmonkeys,3d9i97,SnapbackYamaka,3,Wed Jul 15 09:19:14 2015 UTC,"The Blond-O-Sonic Shimmer Trap is in my top 3 AM songs. It has the darkness of Humbug mixed with the arena rock sound of SIAS, which to me is the perfect blend. I feel that it's easily one of their most underrated tracks."
arcticmonkeys,3d9i97,moiadipshit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:05 2015 UTC,Just had it playing on the way to work! It's definitely one of my favourites too. It's got such a great mix of all their influences. On another note Suck It And See was the only album I didn't see a tour gig for because I felt it was too intimate to be played in arenas. Interesting you had the opposite feeling towards it!

Lyrically as good as anything he's ever written. The breakdown is one of the best parts in any of their songs. Live it is incredible (obligatory mention of the Valencia show).  It's one of those that never loses its replay value.  Also the way Homme tells it, it was the first note of the demo that made him agree to produce Humbug."

I think this song has some of Alex's best lyrics in his entire career, and this song damn near gives me goosebumps if played in the right situation.   ""Can you hack your mind being riddled with the wrong memories?"" is probably my favorite line on the entire album...  Amazing song, through and through."

It's a go-go rock song. The song you just want to belt along with and hammer the riff out to. It's a great song, and it's probably to do with the simplicity.   The concert - amazing. The Glastonbury 2013 concert is always on my iPhone. It's one of their best. The orchestrals at the end are gorgeous. There's so much power to the concert and they are all clearly loving it. Also the re-living of all their classic songs and the turn you can hear they are having into the AM era in it... Love it.  This song live - well. The combination of the two explanations above. Powerful rock song performed gracefully and powerfully. Love it."

arcticmonkeys,3ctn29,CommanderPaprika,11,Sun Jul 12 09:17:08 2015 UTC,"The ultimate genre hopping sound changing band would have to be Primal Scream. Their first album is lovely twee indie pop. It's called Sonic Flower Groove. Light and fluffy, followed on by a heavy punk/garage self titled album with really weird semi psych cuts like Kill the King.   Of course they follow up that with an acid house, 90s rave dance album- Screamadelica. I'll say nothing about this one, it stands for itself. Then they followed that up with a Rolling Stones indebted slab of rock n roll, skinny jeans funk and 80s balladry, Give Out But Don't Give Up.  Then they have the ambient influenced and their darkest album at the time, Vanishing Point. Complete with 8 minute instrumentals and wild drum machines its an odyssey of sound, from the uplifting Star to the schizophrenic If They Move Kill 'Em and Kowalski.  Then they have XTRMNTR. This is a filthy angry thrashy album, rebelling against pop, against rock, against establishment, multi nationals, you name it. It's angry and industrial grinding noise. And its fucking brilliant. Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine joined the band with this album and they had contributions from Jags Kooner and The Chemical Brothers.  The direction begun on Vanishing Point, and carried on in XTRMNTR is continued on Evil Heat. This album is more dance floor friendly, with quite a few garage freakouts and gospel hymns thrown in there for good measure. It has some light psychedelic touches to lighten the mood. Also has Bobby Gillespie's old bandmate Jim Reid feature on Rise, a song originally called Bomb the Pentagon.  Then they released Riot City Blues. If Give Out... was Stones influenced, this is more Small Faces and Who-ish at times.  It's ridiculously fun with the silliest lyrics you can imagine- ""She got by giving head to a priest/that fucker choked on his rosary beads""  Then they released the pop album Beautiful Future. This deftly hops between light and dark and has Josh Homme on guitar at one point. It's really changeable and their least focused and least coherent, but it boasts many standout tracks not least Can't Go Back and Suicide Bomb. Very enjoyable.  However, More Light, their most recent is in my eyes, their best. With 9 minute sax and synth driven state of the nation addresses, 7 minute sitar driven portraits of domestic abuse complete with dissonant Sax breakdowns and hard rap, the album straddles everything that the band had done up to that point. Oh, and those three songs I mentioned there? That's only the first three songs.  I'd recommend Primal Scream to anyone with ears tbh. Also the Stone Roses, they changed from indie pop to dance to blues rock and funk"

Radiohead has always kept the rock style but they've basically tried everything. Try comparing Anyone Can Play Guitar to Separator by Radiohead . Both great songs but they sound like from different universes.

arcticmonkeys,3ctn29,TeddyPickNPin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I can't stand Radiohead, but thank you for the recommendation!"
arcticmonkeys,3ctn29,NBlobSThrowaway,2,Sun Jul 12 09:25:35 2015 UTC,Understand. I wasn't recommending them. I was just mentioning their contrast. And Radiohead is not for everyone.
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Interpolice,12,Thu Jul 9 21:32:30 2015 UTC,That was predictable.
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,SimonCFC,25,Thu Jul 9 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"Apparently Humbug is an ""unimportant stepping stone between albums"". I know its the writers opinion and all but.. calling a very different and objectively great album trivial and bullshit is really just poor taste. These are the lads who I know as the Arctic Monkeys Magazine, really didn't expect them to dismiss an album."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,SaturatedEel,11,Thu Jul 9 22:33:24 2015 UTC,Humbug is by far my favorite. The lyrics and sound are so amazing. But I'm into moody shit. AM is the one that made them pretty popular at least in the states. I remember friends making fun of me for some of their songs and when AM came out they were playing it in their car.  it just has a more generally pleasing tone if that makes sense.  Personally I think SIAS is the last but hey
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,ahhtasha,9,Fri Jul 10 02:35:17 2015 UTC,"Who would have thought NME would put AM at #1?    I'm shocked I tell ya, shocked."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,pine_apples,27,Fri Jul 10 01:43:19 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one here who feels ranking their albums is pretty much pointless? They are all amazing original albums, all with their own great memorable top songs. Every single album has its own theme and brings something special to the table. It's just to much of a apples to oranges comparison to come to any real agreement."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Thr998,3,Thu Jul 9 22:07:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Not only are they all phenomenal records from top to bottom, they're each so unique that it's hard to weigh them on balance."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,demosthenes718,16,Fri Jul 10 05:23:58 2015 UTC,I think we all knew what #1 was gonna be.
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,nicknamed_nugget,15,Thu Jul 9 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"Lol mine is literally the opposite. I find Humbug the best, SiaS is second, FWN third, debut fourth and AM last, as much as I like it."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Pedrohht,3,Thu Jul 9 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"I find the first 4 albums tied and AM last by a small margin, but it's still a great album and the one that got me into Arctic Monkeys in the first place."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,lzgr,4,Fri Jul 10 00:16:15 2015 UTC,The longer you listen to Humbug and SIAS the more and more they'll slowly edge their way forward haha
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Played_Out_Monkey,2,Fri Jul 10 14:14:21 2015 UTC,"They're definitely growers, at first you don't quite get the feel of the album"
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Benjaminooo,4,Sat Jul 11 05:31:02 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you, although FWN and WPSIATWIN are pretty much tied for me. AM is a different story and though I like the sound of the album in general and I really like some songs, I feel like it's not as good as their previous works."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Benjaminooo,5,Fri Jul 10 00:00:48 2015 UTC,Humbug ranked number 5: queue this reddit going crazy...
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Russianzombie,8,Fri Jul 10 07:04:12 2015 UTC,"Humbug last and AM first, shouldn't it be the other way around?"
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,Dave-F-Grohl,3,Thu Jul 9 23:15:50 2015 UTC,"I have more of a problem with Humbug being last than AM being first. But then it's NME, they were always looking to appeal to the lad rock section of the Arctic Monkeys fan base."
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,MattN92,5,Fri Jul 10 02:59:59 2015 UTC,am is the worst
arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,fagdrew4l,8,Fri Jul 10 04:22:18 2015 UTC,Such bullshit. Humbug should've been the first no matter what. Such a musical masterpiece

arcticmonkeys,3cq2xo,TheDoomPlayer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:39:16 2015 UTC,"I personally think she's sold Humbug short (it's definitely in my top 2, if not 1st) and if you're going to do a listing like this, at least go through with it. I think the debut album is great, but if you're going to call it 'near-perfect' you can't put it at number 2 just because 'it would be doing a disservice to the band'."

arcticmonkeys,3cq6jy,juansalerno142,3,Thu Jul 9 23:04:30 2015 UTC,Same. I think some people jump on the 'Hate The Bad Thing' bandwagon because just because the band members didn't like it that much. I think it's insanely catchy.
arcticmonkeys,3cq6jy,iEvn,2,Fri Jul 10 02:48:21 2015 UTC,"I know it's not the way recording an album goes, but I love that What If You Were Right The First Time sounds like a B-side"
arcticmonkeys,3cq6jy,moiadipshit,7,Fri Jul 10 12:38:12 2015 UTC,Temptation. Although I totally am aware that it probably wouldn't fit in with the 'feel' of the album.

arcticmonkeys,3cbaan,Dave-F-Grohl,25,Mon Jul 6 15:53:28 2015 UTC,For me it has to be this performance of Dance Little Liar from 2010. The long coats and sunglasses really fit the atmosphere the song is supposed to create. I especially love the ending part where Alex sings the last verse an octave higher.
arcticmonkeys,3cbaan,Dalek356,3,Mon Jul 6 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"Holy crap. It sounds like a studio recording, but because of the power that is then pumped into that last chorus because Turner's hitting the edge of his vocal range and like you said, an octave higher, is amazing!

Still bothers him to this day"
arcticmonkeys,3cbaan,Dalek356,6,Tue Jul 7 12:06:48 2015 UTC,"Personally it would be this performance of 'Snap Out of It'. It's perfect to me in every way. Not a sour note hit, perfect dynamics/EQing, so beautifully simple and so exciting. It is one of the rare instances where I think Turner sung it better live than on the record."

The start and main part of the song has some great guitar, bass and drums, as well as being overall easy on the ear. But the end is even better, the drum parts here are phenomenal and the sound is very strong.  All in all, I would place this high up on the best songs list. It's one of my favourites. I give it a 9.8/10 just because it's not perfect, but still an outstanding tune.     Your do-rights and individes   I've always heard this as ""Your derisory divides"". Is what you wrote definitely right? Just want to make sure, that's all."
arcticmonkeys,3c491a,DJCouttyboy123,6,Sat Jul 4 17:31:49 2015 UTC,Good point about the lyrics.  Genius have the lyrics as 'Your do-rights or individes'.  Whilst Metrolyrics have it as 'Your derisory divides'.  The EP itself doesn't come with a lyrics insert so there is no official answer regarding the lyrics.  However I believe the lyrics are 'Your derisory divides'.

I really enjoy the song, it's got great lyrics, and musically its got the raw energy feel to it. But I don't think it has that mass appeal that so many tracks on the first record did. Mostly due to just subjective reasons I give this an 8/10.    Oh, in five years time, will it be ""Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?""   I wonder if Alex ever looks back at that lyric and thinks ""nope, we fucking kept at it"""

arcticmonkeys,3c491a,TheDoomPlayer,7,Sat Jul 4 20:17:36 2015 UTC,"It's my second most played tune from them so I feel like I should have something to say.  First of all, the structure of the song is awesome. This is the only time they kinda did a regular song, and after it ends (around 3:10) they make a lot of interesting stuff (including THE ONLY DRUM SOLO THEY HAVE ON THEIR SONGS) which leads to the actual end. The only song I know that has a similar structure is The Jewellers' Hands (the song could end in half, but there's an extraordinary outro too).  And the song is kinda unusual. It truly wouldn't fit on the album, it's great that it has it's own place on EP and I can only dream to see it live one day. But it won't happen, because they changed and don't feel it - blah blah. That's one of those moments, when I have problems with accepting their maturity nowadays."

arcticmonkeys,3c491a,ZordonFreemanI,3,Sat Jul 4 23:01:13 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be funny is someone covered this song but the fairweather fans thought they were talking shit about Arctic Monkeys?

arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,SirBruceLillis,26,Sat Jul 4 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"I find Do I Wanna Know significantly more enjoyable whilst listening to it with headphones, simply because the bass in that song is amazing, and its sound isn't replicated as well when listening to it through speakers."
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,SausageBarm,4,Sun Jul 5 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also through this, I noticed what made the guitar sound so cool (Distorted one ear, clean other)"
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,SimonCFC,15,Sun Jul 5 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"Tbh everything sounds better with good quality cans, it's like breathing new life into a song you've heard a million times before. But I'd say the most difference can be heard on AM and Humbug - particularly for the bass on the former, and the instrument separation on the latter.  Listening to something like Dance Little Liar or The Jeweller's Hands, you can pick out all the little melodies and harmonies that can otherwise get a bit blurred. Not to mention, little things like hearing fingers sliding on guitar strings, or a shuffle in the background which just make it feel more real."
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,pine_apples,-2,Sun Jul 5 04:30:07 2015 UTC,My skull candy headphones have made a world of difference in Humbug songs.
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,sukgar,9,Thu Jul 9 23:02:42 2015 UTC,View From the afternoon the constant switching between the left and right side of the headphones is so good.
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,BGrizzle93,3,Sun Jul 5 17:51:31 2015 UTC,Yeah i like Arabella and DIWK more when I listen to them I'm headphones.. And I prefer it that way.

arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,Ryanoski09,3,Sun Jul 5 07:38:37 2015 UTC,If you were there beware became way better when my left headphone started working properly.
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,ZordonFreemanI,2,Tue Jul 7 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"Good responses here. I can also confirm that some parts of AM album sound better on headphones. There's basically an echo for e.g. in ""R U Mine?"" that sounds like something out of this world.  And the switching in ""The View From The Afternoon"" is great as well."
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,TheDoomPlayer,2,Sun Jul 5 21:21:44 2015 UTC,All of AM is a well produced album meant for a good sound system. You'll hear rich sounds with headphones for sure.
arcticmonkeys,3c5egg,tynamite,2,Mon Jul 6 00:40:25 2015 UTC,I think the LSP album sounds better with headphones. That and I.D.S.T.
arcticmonkeys,3bzjta,lzgr,14,Fri Jul 3 12:34:26 2015 UTC,"Though I fucking love Arctic Monkeys, I don't think they're that great of a band live. Maybe during the Humbug tour, but AM tour is definitely a bit bland and the setlist is really repetitive. Sorry guys, gotta step up your live game a bit."
arcticmonkeys,3bzjta,MattN92,11,Fri Jul 3 12:38:40 2015 UTC,"AM tour is definitely a bit bland and the setlist is really repetitive   Humbug tour was exactly like that, at least with the AM tour Turner looked like he was enjoying himself.  Personally I never saw them in 05-07 but I would say they were at their best during 2011, especially the first few months of that tour."
arcticmonkeys,3bzjta,MattN92,10,Fri Jul 3 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but on the Humbug tour they had all that darkness jazz going on, this tour was about Alex walking around the stage like a peacock thinking he's the coolest shit ever."
arcticmonkeys,3bzjta,Dave-F-Grohl,5,Fri Jul 3 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"I don't remember much in the way of ""darkness jazz"". Stage production-wise, I liked the big lit up AM letters (and later the oscilloscope) and the Do I Wanna Know intro tape from the AM tour. And again, give me a frontman who is trying too hard to be into it over one who is trying too hard to not be into it. That fucking Humbug whisper, man."
arcticmonkeys,3bzjta,Grom8,3,Fri Jul 3 16:54:55 2015 UTC,"Saw them early 2012 and again in 2014 and the SIAS-show was arguably a lot better than their AM show. As /u/Izgr pointed out their setlist was really repetitive and bland during the entire AM tour, it lacked energy. Most of the songs from the early records were played at a noticeably lower speed which was a real bummer. Whereas their show in 2012 was filled with energy and fast songs like Evil twin, The View From The Afternoon, Little Illusion Machine and so on. I Just hope they turn up the pace a bit for their next record; more songs like R U Mine or their SIAS and Humbug b-sides, which for some weird reason are often better than the actual album tracks."
arcticmonkeys,3bzjta,Dalek356,3,Fri Jul 3 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, their setlist is very repetitive, I would love some new live songs of em"

arcticmonkeys,3bxwks,Dalek356,14,Fri Jul 3 03:34:14 2015 UTC,When he starts beating up photographers then I'll consider him to be the next Liam Gallagher
arcticmonkeys,3bxwks,AnArcticTaco,7,Fri Jul 3 04:20:32 2015 UTC,"Or shagging around on his own honeymoon.  Or coming out with ""controversial"" statements to stay relevant.  Or losing every single bit of musical talent he has."

Brianstorm, Balaclava, Do Me A Favour, Teddy Picker and Fluorescent Adolescent.   There is one genuine demo for FWN and it's the much better version of The Bad Thing"

If you want to do b-sides by era, you're gonna need to find a list and arrange it accordingly. I would do that for you, but...busy. Then finding averages, well you can just look at the raw data to see how I do it. Of course there are other ways to do it (I think), so just do that however you want.   As for the album, check out here. The guide is unfortunately not finished, as that is something else I was supposed to do but...busy.

arcticmonkeys,3bcbwf,BackTo0151,8,Wed Jul 1 18:58:57 2015 UTC,"A teddy picker are those claw games filled with stuffed animals that you try to win by manipulating the claw, grabbing the teddy bear (or whatever it is) and getting it back to the start. I always interpreted the lyrics to speak to the randomness of reality TV or shows like American Idol. Thrusting people into fame and it not being at all what they expected. ""Already thick and you're getting thicker"" is that English slang for thick meaning slow?"
arcticmonkeys,3bcbwf,Gre3nArr0w,11,Sun Jun 28 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think that the whole teddy picker thing is a metaphor for the Music industry and there experience with trying to find a record label.  ""They've sped up to the point where they provoke The punch-line before they have told the joke""  They want you to hit your peak without building up to it so the record labels can make money off you as fast as possible.   ""Plenty of desperation to be seen Staring at the television screen""  Pretty straight forward, but every artist wants to get noticed and puts the spotlight on a pedestal.  ""Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist It wasn't in the top 100 list.""  If you aren't in the top 100 you aren't worth it.  ""And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder, Don't be surprised when you get bent over, They told you, but you were dying for it""  You will get fucked over, if you aren't careful.  Okay you get the point I'm trying to make, the whole song is about record labels and there experience with it, since every record label wanted them to release Mardy bum as a single and they wouldn't sign if they had to do that."

This is a quote from Alex as per genius.com...  The teddy picker is like, the idea of playing with one of them machines is like keeping peoples attention, you can’t grab on to it.

""Show me the jaccuzi"": she's aware of how classy and high profile this Brian guy is, and really wants to be part of that lifestyle. This fits with the theme of the song, which is that Brian doesn't even have to try but every girl still wants him, and all the guys are jealous of him for it.

arcticmonkeys,3b9g26,Llamaking9901,30,Sat Jun 27 01:46:44 2015 UTC,"OK, different songs you should listen to - to be fair, I'll name 2 from each album, give you my reasons why they are brilliant and tell you my interpretation of them.  WPSIATWIN (Album 1): When the Sun Goes Down - Sums up the sound of the first album very well and is possibly, along with I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor, what made the first album. A song about a pimp (a scummy man) and the girl he whores out.  Mardy Bum - A great catchy song that also shows off the routes of the band. A song about being around a depressed girl constantly, driving down his mood and pissing the protagonist off.  FWN (Album 2): Teddy Picker - Amazing song. Catchy riff and solo. Shows how the band has grown but still connected to album 1. About how new amazing underground/indie bands are ignored and shitty massed produced 'Top 100' songs are all the same crap and pap, and how it's all a game (hence 'Teddy Picker').  Do Me A Favour - AMAZING crescendo and shows lyrical prowess from Turner. About breaking up with someone you love/d. Simple and brilliant.  Humbug (Album 3): Crying Lightning - In my (and evidently other AM fan's opinion) AM's best song ever. Insanely complex and in-depth lyrics, brilliant guitar orchestrations, amazing drumming and catchy as all hell, 'Crying Lightning' is gold. About being suckered in by a man-eater, against all your will, and having all that you loved of that first hit being dragged out of you to the point of hate... and you realised you were suckered in because of her mascara running and her little games (crying lightning).  Cornerstone - Sums up a lot of the sound of Humbug. Slightly psychedelic, soft yet bursting with sound, poetic and with subtle undertones of tragedy. Most likely about losing your partner and looking everywhere for someone to be her, and in the end going nuts because of it and having to find her again in her sister who's gone nuts (in the Cornerstone, a mental hospital in Sheffield).  SIAS (Album 4): Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair - The next step in their growth. A turn to the slight 'US' sound, but with still heavy rock and fun lyrics, showcasing Turner & Co's brilliant use of simple riffs and layered textures. About taking chances in life, but not going too far... because you may push it that little too far and fuck everything up with the most simple act (hitting your arse/ass on the ground 'cause someone moved your chair).  Suck It and See - Sums up the sound of the album once again. Mix of hard and soft, but tending towards a bit harder in sound, and lovely lyrics (I really do think AM's lyrics alone should have sold you the band by this point)! About risking falling in love with someone, doing all you can to love them and not caring about the consequences because ultimately you may as well try and see, otherwise you'll never know!  AM (Album 5): R U Mine? - Catchy as fuck. I mean, holy hell. So catchy. GREAT riff, showing the most complex marriage of riff and vocal line (along with Do I Wanna Know?) and leads in perfectly from what you would have heard of AM (i.e. Do I Wanna Know). However, Arabella also sums that up (another track on this album), but I feel this song is more original and catchier than Arabella, but I would like to point out that that is MY opinion. Pretty self explanatory like most of this album's songs. Also Turner uses an interesting lyrical technique in the opening verse where he answers the line he sings before AFTER he has sung it. He wants to know... R U MINE?! (Also, clever use of text speak to plug into the modern generation's use of communication to find out the answers to big questions instead of doing it face-to-face).  Snap Out of It - The most unique song of AM's (again, very arguable). This is the closest I think they get to pop music, but is SO well done and catchy that I've not found a person yet that doesn't enjoy it in some way. The chorus alone will, I'm sure, have you humming it all damned day. A song about seeing someone infatuation to the point they are losing it over someone, and you having to tell them - ""THIS ISN'T YOU, SNAP OUT OF IT!"""
