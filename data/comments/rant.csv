And on the subject of poor black men, it has absolutely nothing to do with comparison.  My experience while working in the 'hood was that most of the people I met who were unemployed and unambitious dropped out of school in late grade school or early high school. They'd grown up in abusive, disgustingly neglectful homes without both of their parents. No one taught them to brush their teeth, shower regularly, look after their health, stay away from drugs, be respectful to authority or value literacy and education. They were from homes devoid of love, and many had never been out of the surrounding neighborhoods in their entire lives. It's a tremendous density of resentment, racism (towards each-other by darkness of skin, as well as non-blacks) and ignorance.  These people don't have any concept of wealth, or understanding of what works against them. They know what they're told about it, and they're told who to vote for, but no one is actually doing anything about fixing their broken culture and the self-perpetuating ignorance and hate. Those who came up with someone in their life who told them their worth, how to value themselves and how to do better often did, and our ""white corporate"" (educated and literate) culture accepts those who move up, despite their inherited handicaps, and it's highly stigmatized to reject these up-and-comers as it draws easy and often false accusations of racism.  So I don't buy it, that rich white men are directly responsible for the failures of American black culture."

rant,3dxa1i,Samatic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"If there's anything that's terrible to a person's ability to improve themselves, it's unearned privilege without ambition.   This is strictly my opinion, but I believe employment and legitimately earning attention (and being re-enforced with positive attention for real accomplishments) are very strongly tied to self-esteem. When people try to give their children self-esteem without enforcing working for it, it serves to do the exact opposite. People with low self-esteem and low self-confidence have it because they've earned little.   I think it's something engrained in us as hunter-gatherers, a social construct which the self-esteem advocates fail to understand. And it has damaged people, who get out in the real world without self-esteem, who have an unreasonable expectation that their needs will be met by the world instead of themselves.  That's where I think all this #poorme #victimized #unappreciated culture has come from."

It promotes excessive waste and greed goes hand in hand with corruption. If we switched to a new system the equality and rampant waste would cease to exist. For instance when you buy something that thing needs to break. At some point it will, the sooner the better, since then you have to go and purchase it again. This is what makes the monetary system work. Just think if we built things that didn't break. Maybe relied upon a new system such as a resource based economy. Using technology to track the resources instead of money. Only then could we be free and equal. Just think the entire world could become your home."

There is no real power in money. Its just that everyone BELIEVES that there is. So we go on year after year striving for more monetary gain which should be able to buy up all the necessary resources we need infinitely. Problem is we don't have infinite resources on this planet. They are limited. A good example is how we are over fishing the oceans. WHY THE FUCK ARE WE DOING THIS! for monetary gain. What will happen when we over fish them and have nothing left to eat? Will we say it was worth it? Of course not it will become a HUGE tragedy of the monetary system."

Sad to say we are the exception when it comes to women and suicide, and have a high attempt rate and a high success rate.    I tried once.  It was not a cry for attention, I wanted to be alone when I did it.  I took around 25 percocets (not vicodins or oxycontins) and managed to get down a half a liter of black velvet whiskey.  I didn't want anyone to see me, so I took my jacket off, left the party I was at, and walked in the woods in the snow in my t shirt (January in new york) until I felt sleepy, and leaned up against a tree and fell asleep, warm by this time.    I woke up shivering and extremely sick, but with the morning sun in my eyes.  To this day I cannot rationalize how that could have been survivable.  Its like sometimes I almost doubt I'm here because it was simply not a survivable action."

rant,3dwzqz,Idrkc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, no. It's because the methods are different. Men will often go for more direct methods such as using a gun, while women will go for pills because they don't want to leave behind a ""mess."" We condition men and women in different ways as a society, so this results in different methods of death. There's actually multiple studies done on this, including one in India where they found that women committing suicide often tried to drown themselves. The only type of suicide that leaves behind a mess that women seem to have a preference for is self-immolation, actually. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19486437  The fact that you'd take something like suicide or suicide attempts and turn it into something to be perceived as ""whorish"", tells me that you're not grown up enough to understand and educate yourself with this information, however. I pity you for your false beliefs about women.  And please, spare me the rantings about the livejournal or tumblr community, as if they represent the majority of depressed or suicidal people/women.

Don't get me wrong, I'm completely behind you with fuck orthodontist thing, my Ortho was an asshole who almost choked me out.

I was fucking done. Half way through my braces procedure I really gave the fuck up in nice teeth. When I smile now I don't even feel like these braces made such a huge change in me. Sure I wasn't into my teeth before and my teeth look great now but it's not something that makes me feel overly satisfied waiting years for. Now theres a possibility I'll need to pull my wisdom teeth. A total of 8 teeth removed from my mouth?! Wow I'm so overcome by joy.   I've come to the conclusion that orthodontists are masochists."

I currently work at fast food place (though it's all really good barbecue and I can eat whatever I want for free, so it could be much worse). My hours are usually noon to about 9-10pm. I'm not able to do anything because when people are willing to do stuff I'm getting ready for work or am at work. After work, I'm tired as hell and no one is willing to do anything. Also, I have to work days like Friday, Saturday, and/or Sunday, when my friends organize social shit. I can't use my full pay because I have to save up for college. I'm a little fucked in the fun department.  But, frankly, I'm pretty damn happy with my job.  I get free fucking barbecue for lunch and dinner (Real barbecue, not bullshit sauce-soaked shit), I get paid, and I'm not working at fucking McDonalds anymore (where you have to pay for lunch, though employees got half off).  You don't yet have a former job to compare yours to, but you can at least look for the good things in the job. For example, you're already getting real world skills and experience that those spoiled shits aren't. Yeah, it sucks, but you got a head start so you can get a less shit job out of college quicker than them (which means more pay and better hours for you).  I'm not trying to make you feel bad about being angry about your job. Working is shitty all around. The problem is you can't un-shitty-afy it, so take the good parts and enjoy those.  Also, enjoy your days off and drag your friends out to do shit. Go shopping. Go watch a movie. Doesn't matter what you're doing, just bring friends along so you don't go nuts. I brought my friend who only plays piano to Guitar Center to look at guitars for an hour. People will go with you to do whatever. Have fun on your days off.  Finally, quit thinking about the future or past right now. You're not graduating college yet and you don't have your overprotective mother to deal with, nor can you change those things. All you're going to do is stress yourself out more thinking about it. Take this time to break out and have some fun. Also, the fun wont go away going into the working world. You still have weekends and other people to do shit with. That doesn't disappear when you become an ""adult."" Frankly, you don't have to act any more mature. My 50-year-old boss was joking about whispering ""penis"" into our new PA system at work. My middle-aged parents regularly make dick jokes.  So, my advice for you: Quit growing up."
