sophieturner,3dktig,areacode212,6,Fri Jul 17 02:06:39 2015 UTC,She look great as a young Jean Grey. The only issue I have with her in the role is I saw the trailer and she REALLY cannot do an authentic American accent. it's a little off-putting :/
sophieturner,3dktig,OfficialGarwood,10,Fri Jul 17 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she sounds way too much like Sansa, only slightly less British. Emilia Clarke on the other hand, did a Valley Girl accent on Jimmy Kimmel, and sounded like a completely different person"
sophieturner,3dktig,OfficialGarwood,3,Fri Jul 17 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly, normally British actors are good at doing American accents (Henry Cavill, Andrew Garfield, Christian Bale etc.) It seems like Sophie will need to spend a lot of time with a dialect coach."
sophieturner,3dktig,Terakahn,6,Fri Jul 17 02:59:13 2015 UTC,House is another great example.
sophieturner,3dktig,th3whom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:15:31 2015 UTC,I thought they weren't trying to mask the accent.  It's what it looks like in the trailer.
sophieturner,3dktig,OfficialGarwood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"Nope, she's clearly trying to use an ""American"" accent. Remember, she's supposed to be a young Famke Janssen."
sophieturner,3dktig,th3whom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:44:59 2015 UTC,Damn.  I at least hope she can do jean justice.  I love me some jean and some sophie turner.
sophieturner,3dktig,Marry_Me_Sansa,-8,Fri Jul 17 04:13:44 2015 UTC,I'm too depressed now about that 4chan story... I hope it's not true.
sophieturner,3dktig,OfficialGarwood,19,Fri Jul 17 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"What 4chan story? YOu mean the one where she supposedly fucked like a million people? Yeah I don't fucking buy it for a second. Even if she did, who gives a shit, it's her life, she can fuck all the people she wants haha!"
sophieturner,3dktig,limeflavoured,16,Fri Jul 17 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"As I said in the other post, I dont believe it because the description of her boobs was overly detailed. Ive got a fairly good memory, but I doubt I could remember that someone I fucked a year ago had a freckle on their left tit. Its not something you pay attention to while your having sex either. The whole thing reads like an autistic fantasy (much like most of 4chan, and I say that as someone with mild autism)"
sophieturner,3dktig,OfficialGarwood,4,Fri Jul 17 04:07:22 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's just a guy living out his pretend fantasy of what he WISHES happened.
sophieturner,3dktig,HeraldHS,0,Fri Jul 17 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if the general concept was true, given the attitude she sometimes shows, but this individual story was fake. If that's how she wants to go about though, that's fine, sex is great so I don't blame her."

sophieturner,3dlkaj,zderp49,2,Fri Jul 17 07:14:15 2015 UTC,You can totally see a poky (as in r/pokies) on her left breast in the top photo. So there's that at least...  Hopefully some higher-quality version of these pics come out soon because there's definitely something here to be worked with.
sophieturner,3dlkaj,bogheart,2,Fri Jul 17 07:26:25 2015 UTC,"And the right, if you look closely  It's a nice photo"
sophieturner,3dlkaj,Dent18,3,Fri Jul 17 07:36:10 2015 UTC,It's always a good gauge of how good a woman's boobs are when she's lying on her back. Here she impresses me yet again.
sophieturner,3dlkaj,bogheart,2,Fri Jul 17 07:54:21 2015 UTC,"in the first one, looks like she might also have some nice side boob."
sophieturner,3dlkaj,pigeon_man,2,Fri Jul 17 10:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's definitely a good look at them. They sure are lovely. Why all of the shots that were officially released in the photoshoot were above the neck, I'll never understand. :)"
sophieturner,3dlkaj,bogheart,-1,Fri Jul 17 10:54:44 2015 UTC,the real question is can anyone make out a freckle on her left breast?!   /s
sophieturner,3dlkaj,Dent18,0,Fri Jul 17 07:37:43 2015 UTC,Not to go back into that territory yet again but freckles aren't permanent anyways. It would be a mole not a freckle. Just another hole in that particular write-up.
sophieturner,3dlkaj,bogheart,3,Fri Jul 17 07:52:56 2015 UTC,"Meh, most people dont know, or dont care about, the difference. There are far bigger holes in the story than that.

sophieturner,3df8dk,Dent18,-17,Wed Jul 15 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"haha is this common in England? What the hell is that?    I got this picture from a thread on 4chan. A guy there posted a story.  Fiction, perhaps. But entertaining fiction nonetheless.      She's a right dirty whore, slept with half of Leamington Spa, I know this from experience   Was she good?   No, sucked dick kinda good but was a limp fish in bed, came inside her though   shaved?   Had a bit of stubble coming though   need details   She's normally out on the town in Leamington Spa, met her in a bar there about a year ago, we got talking and had a few drinks  Went back to my place, started making out, sucked my dick, had sex, came in her,   Got up the next day and made out for a bit, fucked her again in the shower.  Saw her again about a week later, she blushed then walked out the bar   hey >>628162133 how were her boobs? please describe every little detail   Quite firm, nipples were pink and perky.Got a large freckle under the left nipple   Didn't eat her out?   In the morning I did, Tastes like heaven. She was all good and wet   Proof?   She's got a rather distinctive freckle on her left boob. Got no photos cause to busy having the sex   Where at on her left boob? Under the boob? The side of her boob?   Just as it starts to curve     Again probably bullshit but it's fun to read. I'll post any updates"
sophieturner,3df8dk,bogheart,16,Wed Jul 15 20:26:33 2015 UTC,And here was me thinking that the worst that would come from this photo would be people photoshopping dicks into it. One can only hope it is bullshit because the idea of her sleeping with the sort of guy nasty enough to brag about it on fucking 4chan is pretty depressing to me.
sophieturner,3df8dk,bogheart,-6,Wed Jul 15 21:01:49 2015 UTC,Haha well honestly I'm just glad to hear the story.   It's not like her fucking this guy will increase or decrease my chances of doing the same.  And she's probably had enough sex with enough people that a few aren't moral paragons that also go on 4chan. She's a incredibly sexy girl on an incredibly popular TV show. It'd be more ridiculous if this wasn't happening.
sophieturner,3df8dk,kj01a,13,Wed Jul 15 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"Using ""I took a picture of her drinking"" as proof of fucking her is a stretch though. And 4chan posters have made up a bunch of shit about her in the past, notably relating to GoT nude scenes which obviously never went down. So, although I'm sure she fucks her fair share, this particular story doesn't convince me."
sophieturner,3df8dk,bogheart,9,Wed Jul 15 21:38:29 2015 UTC,And 4chan posters have made up everything that's ever been posted.   FTFY
sophieturner,3df8dk,limeflavoured,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:36:48 2015 UTC,"I see. Makes sense  FWIW he didn't post this pic, it was just a picture I've never seen before posted in the thread that I used as a vehicle to post the story"
sophieturner,3df8dk,limeflavoured,2,Wed Jul 15 21:59:12 2015 UTC,Aha.
sophieturner,3df8dk,limeflavoured,3,Wed Jul 15 22:04:14 2015 UTC,"Well TIL that all good looking women are sluts.   If that wasnt your intent then Im sorry for the sarcasm, but it came across that way."
sophieturner,3df8dk,votre-mere,-2,Thu Jul 16 14:05:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think I was trying to say that  I'm more saying, either this happened or something very similar to this has happened, why not just believe it and enjoy the details rather then vehemently deny it cause there's no point not believing"
sophieturner,3df8dk,TheOtherMyAccount,6,Thu Jul 16 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. And however much I want to believe something, 4chan is pretty much the bottom of the believabilty pile."
sophieturner,3df8dk,bogheart,6,Thu Jul 16 16:01:41 2015 UTC,What makes me disbelieve it is the overly detailed description of her boobs. If I was fucking someone I really wouldnt pay attention to the fact they had a freckle on their tit.
sophieturner,3df8dk,throwawayb8,3,Thu Jul 16 09:04:57 2015 UTC,"It's a fishbowl, although it looks nothing like one. Looks to be filled with Sangria, which is Spanish."
sophieturner,3df8dk,bogheart,2,Thu Jul 16 12:05:02 2015 UTC,"Is Leamington Spa a reasonably well-known area in the UK?  I've certainly never heard of it, which seems to lend the story at least some degree of credibility."
sophieturner,3df8dk,ApplesandEve,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:43:46 2015 UTC,It's pretty easy to look her up and find out she's from there and went to school there. She talks about it in a bunch of interviews. That really doesn't lend credence to this story.
sophieturner,3df8dk,ApplesandEve,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"Look at both these pics of her from /r/xray, both show a dark dot beneath her left nipple. Confirmed.  Image 1  Image 2  Gotta zoom in, but there's something there to cause contrast."
sophieturner,3df8dk,Marry_Me_Sansa,4,Thu Jul 16 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"I don't see what you're pointing out, but even if it's there it should be noted that these pictures came out before the person on 4chan made up their little story."

sophieturner,3cw4jy,OmniBlade,10,Sat Jul 11 07:16:26 2015 UTC,Is that nipple or a fantasy?
sophieturner,3cw4jy,votre-mere,4,Sat Jul 11 07:59:10 2015 UTC,That's the big question really. Is it a bit of areola or is it just a pasty or some of that tape actresses' put on to get the dress to stick. It's hard to tell.
sophieturner,3cw4jy,teh1knocker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:12:00 2015 UTC,In the meantime I've zoomed up on it even closer and the skin around that area looks quite bumpy. So I'd go with areola actually.
sophieturner,3cw4jy,OfficialGarwood,13,Sat Jul 11 09:51:31 2015 UTC,Nah I'm pretty sure those are pasties.
sophieturner,3cw4jy,teh1knocker,3,Sat Jul 11 13:06:10 2015 UTC,I was almost sure that they were too at first but zoom in on this one (on paint or something that lets you zoom even closer). http://www.farfarawaysite.com/section/comiccon/gallery2/gallery1/hires/97.jpg In this picture her boob's moved to the other side of the gap in the dress and I think if you zoom in on the section there it's a bit easier to discern what's there...
sophieturner,3cw4jy,OfficialGarwood,5,Sat Jul 11 23:26:46 2015 UTC,It's one big pastie.
sophieturner,3cw4jy,Dent18,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a pastie. I've seen xrays, her areolas aren't that big! hahaha"

sophieturner,3cugyx,limeflavoured,3,Sun Jul 12 16:32:29 2015 UTC,Is Sophie drunk in all of these
sophieturner,3cugyx,AdmiralAckbarAMA,4,Sun Jul 12 20:43:02 2015 UTC,I kinda wondered if it was one of those pot lollipop or something. Each picture she has it and is getting touchy feels with the other actresses there. The next day she doesn't have a lolly and she is a bit more conservative.
sophieturner,3cugyx,tanne_sita_jallua,2,Mon Jul 13 02:31:26 2015 UTC,Where are these From!

sophieturner,3cu0yn,spilledmilk03,2,Sat Jul 11 05:12:53 2015 UTC,From the outfit I can guess she's going to be on the X-Men panel?
sophieturner,3cu0yn,pearljam9510,7,Fri Jul 10 22:23:42 2015 UTC,"She is on the Game of Thrones panel, I don't know if she appears on the X-Men one aswell."

sophieturner,3cmygu,swedocme,18,Thu Jul 9 21:44:49 2015 UTC,I just bought the Blurays and was marathoning it when I noticed this scene.   Quite exciting. I don't know why I've never seen it mentioned before.   Oh and here's the shot from my TV. A bit less compression (the gfycat is lightened to maximize hype):  http://imgur.com/xqdsx1J
sophieturner,3cmygu,spilledmilk03,8,Thu Jul 9 04:01:23 2015 UTC,i'm just curious what (if anything) she's wearing under that robe
sophieturner,3cmygu,bogheart,4,Thu Jul 9 05:07:55 2015 UTC,Probably not much of anything by the looks of it. Maybe some tape or pasties to make sure nothing falls out too much.  Here's the scene it's from in 1080p on youtube for reference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49_cPvbNA54 There are a few other pleasant shots earlier in the scene...Around 42 seconds in there's an angle that I think is also particularly worth analyzing.
sophieturner,3cmygu,throwawayfhdgs,25,Thu Jul 9 08:23:28 2015 UTC,Probably never mentioned because she was 15 at the time. Edit: Of course I'm saying this while here we have Ariel Winter at 15...
sophieturner,3cmygu,JTaber615,-26,Thu Jul 9 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah someone call Chris Hanson, we've got some guys he'll want to meet"
sophieturner,3cmygu,CuriousBob97,6,Thu Jul 9 07:04:27 2015 UTC,"Not really huge, but it is interesting since she would of been 16, 17 at max, when this was shot. I do very much prefer her season 5 cleavage, when shes bruised and beaten from Reek and there is major cleavage."
sophieturner,3cmygu,imapervandilikeit,4,Thu Jul 9 07:54:01 2015 UTC,Me too
sophieturner,3cmygu,throwawayfhdgs,7,Thu Jul 9 11:13:13 2015 UTC,thanks
sophieturner,3cmygu,BigStereotype,5,Thu Jul 9 17:22:22 2015 UTC,She was definitely only 15 because her birthday is in February and they would have been done shooting by then
sophieturner,3cmygu,Edwwardo,7,Thu Jul 9 17:13:19 2015 UTC,What the fuck bruh. This whole thread is like the worst vibe.
