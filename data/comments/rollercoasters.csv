rollercoasters,3e37o1,JamminJay1986,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"A new credit, hooray!  Actually this looks pretty fun..."
rollercoasters,3e37o1,Imaginos64,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:23 2015 UTC,"Nice looking coaster.  From the article, however, ""E&F is best known for building the legendary roller coaster at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk"".  Certainly they built the Sea Serpent there but that's not what comes to mind when I think legendary roller coaster at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk."
rollercoasters,3e2fqc,TrevorBondi,5,Tue Jul 21 13:06:13 2015 UTC,Great job with the ride.  Somebody needs to do this for the new Kentucky Kingdom RMC. Their No Limits model was awful.
rollercoasters,3e2fqc,lonequark,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:48 2015 UTC,The coaster looks good but the first 50 seconds annoyed me to no end with the worlds slowly flashing on screen.

rollercoasters,3e2bgx,Bricktycoon,4,Tue Jul 21 12:23:59 2015 UTC,"Underneath Intimidator's hard, NASCAR exterior, I think it's really a beautiful and delicate symphony of floater airtime. It's a nice counterpart to Fury's go, go, go! speed and intensity. Best ridden in rows 7, 9, or 11, I think.  I also liked Nighthawk! Easily the weirdest flying coaster I've been on. Starts out with a ""what the heck is going on?"" feeling that pretty much lasts the entire ride. Much better than Firehawk at KI.  Afterburn is a strong B&M invert. I'd put it up near Raptor on my list. The park interaction is fun. Multiple times I had people pointing cameras at me coming down from the station flyover.  So yeah, Carowinds is great. Everything else is kind of a sideshow to Fury 325, but that's okay."
rollercoasters,3e2bgx,vinciblechunk,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:59 2015 UTC,Nighthawk and Firehawk are pretty much the same layout. Theres a few minor differences but the elements are the same. Have you been on both? What makes Nighthawk better? I rode Firehawk when it was at Geauga Lake and was pretty disappointed. Especially after going on Tatsu. I thought B&M flyers were ay superior after riding Tatsu.
rollercoasters,3e2bgx,cubman2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"I think it has a lot to do with Nighthawk being smack in the center of the park, flying over water, geese, crowds of people, and other random things. It's in a much busier setting than Firehawk. I remembered the ending being different, too, although re-watching the POVs for both, I'm not sure why I thought that.  But yes, it's all relative. I do like B&M flyers better. And that's coming from only riding Superman and Manta. I've heard nothing but the highest praise about Tatsu."
rollercoasters,3e2bgx,vinciblechunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:33 2015 UTC,Well I actually just watched them both and they have the same elements but nighthawk approaches the last two barrel rolls going in facing the sky rather than the ground. So what you saod would make perfect sense. Your direction changes more in the nighthawk layout. Now I guess I will ride it whenever I make it to Carowinds. I just hate how long the lines are of the vekoma's for the mediocre experience at best

rollercoasters,3dz17h,bonsaiisuperstar,5,Mon Jul 20 23:49:57 2015 UTC,Here is an article about the ride. Looks like they're going to remake Twisted Twins into Storm Chaser. Not entirely surprising since its been SBNO for 8 years. Here is a POV of what is used to look like.
rollercoasters,3dz17h,Jstbcool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"This, by far, is the best possible usage of Twisted Trash...errr, Twins. Just a total garbage ride, IMO.   This new one looks like it will have a lot of airtime."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,bassististist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:14:15 2015 UTC,"I think the only better way would have been if they kept them dueling, but yeah I agree. Went on it while SF still owned the place, and it was just not enjoyable at all."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,themcgician,7,Tue Jul 21 14:29:34 2015 UTC,Are these for real?  It looks like an amateur design in NoLimits Coaster Simulator.  Usually when I see teasers or coaster pre-renders from manufacturers they look way more professional.
rollercoasters,3dz17h,pipnewman,9,Mon Jul 20 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think I remember reading somewhere that the promo videos depend on the parks budget for marketing the ride.  A smaller park like KK (and kolmarden with wildfire) wouldn't be able to fork out the extra money for a high quality promo animation like with Fury325, Wicked Cyclone, etc, and instead would go with NL2, while a bigger park, like one of the Cedar Fair or Six Flags parks, would go with 3dvip  This also makes me thing that this is the reason almost every B&M promo video has been a 3dvip promo video, since a park that has enough money for fork out for a B&M should be able to pay a bit more for a good quality animation."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,pipnewman,3,Mon Jul 20 22:16:57 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  I just wonder if some of these are just fan videos made at home...or if they're real.
rollercoasters,3dz17h,FlyRobot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I was very confused with Cannibal since it was delayed for so long and I couldn't find any POV or test footage for a long time
rollercoasters,3dz17h,Zephaerus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:20 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that this wasn't even filmed with the professional version of NL2 ($99 -- compared to the $49 of the regular). If you have the pro version, you can actually record in higher FPS regardless of computer quality, as it'll slow down the simulation to render all frames. This video was made straight out of the Play function on the regular version, and a screen-capture tool was probably used to record instead of the actual NL2 video export."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,tideblue,3,Wed Jul 22 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"Wow. Looks fantastic, and it's good to see that they've really revitalized this park in such a short time. Is there anything left for them to reopen after next season?"

rollercoasters,3dz17h,rpungello,3,Mon Jul 20 23:41:50 2015 UTC,Green Lantern is one of my least favorite rides at SFGAdv. The OTSRs give me a bit of a headache after riding.

rollercoasters,3dz17h,JohnnyUpsidedown,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:50 2015 UTC,Nice. Looks interesting but sad to see it not bing left a duel coaster.  So this is iron horse then it will become a steel coaster. Steel track and supports no longer a wooden coaster. It just has the look of a wooden structure. .
rollercoasters,3dz17h,Col_Rolf_Klink,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:08 2015 UTC,Is this going to be the first RMC makeover outside of the Six Flags parks?
rollercoasters,3dz17h,ScottyGefell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:11 2015 UTC,I think so.
rollercoasters,3dz17h,CurbYourNewUrbanism,8,Tue Jul 21 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I think it counts as a makeover just as much as the other ones they've done; the existing station, lift, and parts of the structure appear to be utilized for this."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,themcgician,2,Mon Jul 20 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"It kinda looks like they will be utilizing parts of both tracks, which is pretty cool"
rollercoasters,3dz17h,ScottyGefell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"So I keep look at this...They are only Iron horsing one of the two tracks, right?  Are they keeping the other side of Twisted Twins or scrapping it?"
rollercoasters,3dz17h,CurbYourNewUrbanism,4,Tue Jul 21 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"I think they are using a lot of the structure from both tracks, but yes it will only be one coaster."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,Harakou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:34 2015 UTC,The video itself looks bad but I really like the layout. I think that first drop will be a lot of fun.
rollercoasters,3dz17h,InvertedPrey,0,Mon Jul 20 20:04:11 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who is tired of RMC? It is like the new Intamin of woodies. Make rides intense for the sole reason of being intense.
rollercoasters,3dz17h,foilfencer591,2,Tue Jul 21 00:34:08 2015 UTC,Why does that matter if they are good rides?
rollercoasters,3dz17h,InvertedPrey,0,Tue Jul 21 18:19:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they aren't good rides. If you like them, kudos to you. But, I miss the days when a ride told a story. When it was designed to be something more than a thrill or a photo on Instagram. Before the Gatekepper keyhole or the Maverick Stengel dive. Back when a coaster could almost be seen as poetry. Kumba, Magnum and Raptor are perfect examples of this."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,FoozMuz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"In those days, the nostalgia just tasted better too."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,InvertedPrey,0,Tue Jul 21 21:43:58 2015 UTC,Banshee accomplishes this as well. Not just nostalgia.

rollercoasters,3dz17h,nannerdw,4,Mon Jul 20 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"What would you change?  Considering what they had to work with (especially with just one side of a ride that was originally laid out with dueling in mind), I think they did a nice job with this conversion.  There's not a lot they could really do to change the overall layout, unless they wanted to tear down the entire structure and rebuild from scratch."
rollercoasters,3dz17h,The_DILinator,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"I think it looks amazing!  I'd say just from appearances, this looks better than Goliath, at minimum!"

rollercoasters,3dz17h,kfordham,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"Not a weak design. That was just an ugly presentation.  Why are they not utilizing NL2? Looks 10 times better. Not as good as professionally modeled and rendered, but it still looks way more professional"
rollercoasters,3e0boh,yodawgyo45,7,Mon Jul 20 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"There isn't that much shade expect the lines really. which is kind of a bummer.   I don't recommend fast pass(this is assuming your trip is atleast 2 days?) the longest a line will get is an hour and it's usually flight of fear or firehawk. Sometimes diamondback can get up to 45 mins but it's rare, same with the Beast. Line times aren't that huge of an issue at KI.  Also a hidden gem is the blue ice cream they sell in the kiddy section of the park. You will pass the stand if you go through the kiddy section to get to the diamondback from the front of the park, it will be on the left. That stuff is amazing! Also they have some good ice cream by the banshee.   Also I'm sure you know this already but don't bring a bag. They stop you from going on the banshee if you have one.  Also make time to go on Drop Tower is way better than any other drop towers I've been on   Hope this helped enjoy your trip!"

rollercoasters,3dykr4,Imaginos64,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:53 2015 UTC,I'm a little upset that it has a clone but I've never ridden one so I'm still fine with it. Maybe more in the future? I hope so
rollercoasters,3dykr4,JEEntertainment89,3,Mon Jul 20 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I expected something more interesting and it's too bad that both of LC's steel coasters will be clones but I still think this will be fun. I really enjoy launches so having a launch coaster near us is going to be cool; can't believe this is/will be the only current one in New England!   I predict they'll focus on the water park in the coming years but I do think some expansion and new attractions are in their future. It's very exciting to see them get a major new coaster, clone or not. It's way better than the dinosaurs from this year, lol."
rollercoasters,3dykr4,Imaginos64,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:45 2015 UTC,Oh god the dinos.  Yeah I hope they find a way to expand around the lake but I don't know what's on the other side. If its barren land then I'd love to see a new coaster but that is most likely not plausible.  If it was it'd be in 5 years and I go so college in less than that. On the bright side I'm still hoping for a new Quassy coaster. (Please be steel and not a clone). Also I'll be able to see SFNE's 2nd coaster in the 5 year plan they released

There was a huge work culture, meaning taking days off or not working open-close shifts caused people to look down on you for not working hard. Ride ops often do more than what is listed in the description. You'll run rides during the time the park is open, but before park/open close your picking up trash, cleaning trains, clearing the area of your ride of debris, checking locks, etc. The most fun part of the job for me is being around roller coasters every day.  Besides that, the work environment is quite poor (coworkers often make or break the ""worth"" factor, and thankfully, I had mostly decent coworkers).   EDIT: Oh, we too get free admission to Cedar Fair parks. Before the park opened full time, I took some trips with coworkers to Cedar Point, King's Island and Carowinds. HR also hosted trips to other Cedar Fair parks throughout the summer."

And bask in the knowledge that this is the original Six Flags park."

You may be able to tour the Cowboy's stadium in the same day if they are away that weekend. Save on parking and park by the ballpark and walk over to the theme park for free if you wish.   Really the main attractions are New Texas Giant and Titan. Mr. Freeze's uniqueness also makes it worth the wait (if there is even a line in December).

rollercoasters,3dwiw2,AttackMoose22,8,Mon Jul 20 03:03:09 2015 UTC,I mean its definitely possible. I would imagine that the Gs would affect you alot after a while tho. be sure to drink lots of water during so you don't blackout. Best of luck to you!
rollercoasters,3dwiw2,jutop42,7,Mon Jul 20 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"50 is doable. With Diamondback on the Fastlane and not the plus there might be a few peeps in line but you should be able to do about 8 laps an hour. Walk fast around the Q, be nice to the ride attendance, say thank you, take what ever seat they give you. After a while they will recognize you and you can sometimes request a seat. Always be nice, if the ride ops like you and see you a lot they will see you are there to ride and get you on the ride faster. Ultimately it all depends on how many peeps are there. If the park is not that buisy you should be able to get lots of rides. With 2 train operation there are about 25 laps an hour total so if you get on every third train you will get around 8 rides an hour. Do it for 5 hours well you do the math..  Keep hydrated and eat, otherwise its all about get down the exit and back in line as fast as you can."
rollercoasters,3dwiw2,JohnnyUpsidedown,4,Mon Jul 20 03:59:11 2015 UTC,"I would say 50 is doable in a day. 100 is tough, as the only time i've done 100 laps on a ride in a single day was during a dedicated ride marathon where I didn't have to get off the coaster between. If the park isn't busy it could be doable. Definitely stay hydrated during the marathon. Make sure you take a break at some point and eat a real meal. The first couple rides after you eat will be the toughest if you hop right back on. The only time i've felt sick on a coaster was getting back on during a marathon right after I finished eating. If you're like me and wear glasses I would highly recommend getting a glasses strap so you can wear them on the ride. Doing a few rides with blurry vision doesn't bug me, but when you're doing a lot back to back I enjoy it much more when I can see clearly."

rollercoasters,3dw3dq,JohnnyUpsidedown,2,Mon Jul 20 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"Good possibility, if the article is true and the ride is taller and shorter then both coasters. Superman clone or a boomerang are good possibilities. Glad to see them getting going on phase 2. I know I will be following along."
rollercoasters,3dw3dq,bssoprano,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:15 2015 UTC,My thought too.  Would be a smart fit for the park.
rollercoasters,3dw3dq,The_DILinator,2,Mon Jul 20 10:21:05 2015 UTC,"Let me say: I LOVE this park!  I took my older two kids there a couple of years ago, and we had a fantastic time, even though the park isn't that large!  White Lightning in particular was amazing, and is in my Top 5 wooden coasters, in spite of its small size!  It was my daughter's first non-kiddie roller coaster, and she rode it over 10 times, while I took about 18 spins on it over the course of the day.  The other bigger coaster is okay, but pretty tame.  Still fun though.  Plus, if you like Go-Karts, it's the best Go-Kart place I've been to - though admittedly I haven't been to too many.  I will definitely be making a trip back there with the family every time I'm in the Orlando area, and am pretty excited to see what they are going to be adding yet!"
rollercoasters,3dw3dq,EwokMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:40:11 2015 UTC,Before Halloween horror nights one year (~2011) me and some buddies picked a Liter of Vodka went to the sonic drive in and just chilled getting free icee refills and jamming out in the car. (We had a Designated driver). We eventually got tired of the scenery topped off our cups and parked out the fun spot.   It was pretty interesting watching the different demographic at this park compared to Disney/Universal. Nonetheless the kids were having the best times of their life.
rollercoasters,3dw3dq,themcgician,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:33:44 2015 UTC,"Man they have jammed so much stuff into a park with a tiny footprint. I would prefer a free spin (or whatever they are called, the non-shitty zac-spins) over one of those superman clones though. I've never been on one, but they just don't seem like that much fun."
rollercoasters,3dwamn,InvertedPrey,10,Mon Jul 20 01:48:43 2015 UTC,"Used to be Millennium Force, but that one's done now. Absolutely lived up to expectations.  But anyway, now would honestly probably be the Voyage. I've slowly started to like wooden coasters more, and what better than one with a goddamn triple-down underground because why not. It just looks way too awesome. I've also heard it to be savagely intense, which is exactly what I like, so hopefully I'll get back out to the US one day. You guys don't know how lucky you are."
rollercoasters,3dwamn,HRTS5X,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:12 2015 UTC,Voyage is totally worth it! easily in my top 10. Also every roller coaster at Holiday World is surprising good. All of them made my top 20. Holiday World is a must visit park
rollercoasters,3dwamn,jutop42,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:08 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, they are pretty much stopping the train with a brake right before you go into the triple-down these days.  I got 2 (out of 20) rides untrimmed during Holiwood Nights this year.  If you've never been, however, you won't know the difference, and the coaster is still absolutely amazing (and completely out of control) even without it!  I only mention it, because the one aspect that is affected is that triple-down. It's still a pretty cool element, however!  I hope you can get there soon to ride it!"
rollercoasters,3dwamn,The_DILinator,5,Mon Jul 20 06:49:45 2015 UTC,Have you rode Maverick at cedar? I'd  say its the best coaster there tbh

Maverick seems to be intense for the simple reason of being intense. Raptor is intense in sections (best ending on ANY coaster), but it also has sections that are relaxed. It is like a piece of poetry."

I will more than likely never get to China, so any of those sweet-looking coasters over there are desired, but realisticaly out of my reach.  I try not to even think about them, since it'll just make me sad!  lol   As for attainable bucket list coasters, Bizzaro at Six Flags New England is actually at the top of my list.  In all of these years since it's been out, and considered one of the best coasters in the world, I have still never made it out to SFNE.  So that is definitely on my to-do list for the next couple of years!  I just wish I could have ridden it in the old days, before the re-theme, and the change in restraints, as reports are that the ride's greatness has definitely been affected.  You can also add ANY RMC coaster to my Bucket List, as I haven't ridden any of them yet.  That should have changed in a month, as I'm planning to ride Goliath at SFGAm on the 19th!  Still, most seem to think that's the worst of the bunch (comparatively speaking - I hear they're all awesome!), so I am definitely anxious to ride all of the rest of them!"
rollercoasters,3dwamn,Jstbcool,2,Mon Jul 20 07:00:04 2015 UTC,Well if you go to SFNE you can ride Bizarro AND an amazing RMC. Bizarro is still a top notch coaster even if the restraints and the audio both suck.  Goliath was my first RMC. I thought it was incredible and a great intro as to why people love their coasters so much. It may be the worst of the bunch (I've only ridden two myself so I can't say) but that doesn't mean much when it's your first taste of the company's work and it's still fantastic. Have fun!

The ACE discounts vary by park but you should figure a 5 to 10 dollar discount. 10% on rental cars, and hotels about the same. Basically its the corporate rate or group rate at parks.  Is it worth it, sure, if you are able to hit a few events and get the perks of private ride times and other cool stuff.   Park discounts are good any day you go. Events at parks cost about what a days admission is but you will get lunch, ERT (ride time) a tour or other perks.   You say you are going to be traveling, its all about events to make it worth your time. Riding a coaster before the park opens with 50 other peeps, I would do it every weekend if I could.  As for Florida... We don't get events very often. Sometimes we get invites to filmings. There should be invites to media day for both Mako and Cobra Curse next year. There most likely will be an ACE event in November at BGT.. week before Thanksgiving. You can also attend IAAPA trade show in November at a good price.   Close events.. Every year ACE southeast has an event in April at SFOG and Carowinds in Sept and an event at Alabama Splash Adventure in June. Dollywood has an enthusiast event in Nov, and one in May.   Other wise, its all about hitting events, getting the perks, riding coasters before the parks are open. If you are hitting a lot of chain parks, get the season passes for all parks. Like Cedar Fair parks platnuim is 180.00 with free parking at all parks. HIt 3 parks and its paid for. Six Flags about the same.   ACE is all what you make of it, I have been a member for 15 years. I joined to ride coasters.   Look through my site in my events sections and you can see some of the stuff you can do. Plus you get a cool magazine every quarter about coasters.   So really its about the events and if you use the discounts, it will pay for the membership.   By the way, did you hit BGT last Friday, am thinking of going this Friday and wondered how buisy it was."
rollercoasters,3dwm3p,JohnnyUpsidedown,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm a member but I've only been to two events. You get really good park discounts, I have an associate membership and it's already paid for itself."

rollercoasters,3dsmqk,silvermarsh,3,Sun Jul 19 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"First of all I’m not as proud of these shots as I am of my Holiday World album but I still wanted to share them. I only took my camera into the park once. While I was shooting Maverick in the late afternoon during a light drizzle a drop got into the lens and took my camera out of commission for the day. Sadly I was unable to get any night shots.  I got to ride the three coasters I’d missed out on last year at the park; Top Thrill Dragster, Wicked Twister, and Cedar Creek Mine Ride. Dragster was my first Intamin accelerator as I’d missed out on Kingda Ka last year too. I got to see first hand just what a maintenance nightmare this ride is. On my first full day at the park I headed right to Dragster after using my early entry on Maverick. I got into the station, a few trains went out…and the ride went down. I stuck it out for forty minutes before leaving and I came back an hour later once I saw a train crest the top hat. This time I was finally able to ride. I had trouble the next day as well. I was set to be on the first train of the day, my restraints checked and ready to go, when we were told there was a problem and we would have to get off the train. The same thing happened again when I rode later that day.  I suppose I’ll write a bit about Dragster as it was a major coaster for me to finally ride and one that I’d been in awe of, that even commanded a bit of fear from me as I’d yet to ride anything like it before. Dragster may be good at hyping you up as you stare at its massive tower but the public is even better at it. Listening to the nervous people around me in line set me up with what I would say are unfair expectations of this coaster’s power. My enthusiast sensibilities melted away and I became another unsure and vulnerable member of the public, wondering exactly what I was getting myself into. The launch looked so fast, the tower so high, and all of this with just lap bar restraints? To my surprise these nerves melted away completely into excited expectation as my train dispatched and I waited for launch. I was finally going to ride!  There’s not much to say about the ride experience that hasn’t been said before. I think I enjoyed the anticipation and “challenge” in a sense of riding Dragster more than the ride itself. The launch really is fun but when you’re on the coaster you have almost no perception of the tower’s height. Since you’re staring up at the sky on your way up the tower by the time you get to the top and get a glimpse of the tiny coasters below you you almost feel detached from it all, like you’re looking at a post card instead of living it in the present tense. Maybe this is because unlike a traditional lift hill there is no natural progression that your brain can process from the time you were near the ground to the point where you find yourself 420 feet in the air. Don’t get me wrong; I did enjoy Dragster and rode it a few more times this trip but I guess I wrongfully expected something more from such a fascinating and intimidating piece of machinery. Regardless I’m excited to hopefully compare it to Kingda Ka next month.  By the time I got off the train I was aware that Dragster had wounded my pride. I can’t remember the last time I was the least bit scared to ride a coaster and after riding it I felt so silly for having ever been nervous to do so. After all an enthusiast should know better, right? I may have mentioned here before that I’m terrified of drop towers and couldn't see myself ever riding Power Tower. However, I guess my ego said otherwise after conquering Dragster and I found myself in line for the drop side. The last time I had ridden a (much shorter) drop tower I had felt panicky half way up. This time I was calm and really enjoyed myself on the ride. It’s weird how the mind works. Am I completely over this fear? Will I ride Zumanjaro in August? We shall see but I’m going to try! All I know is that I rode Power Tower about five more times that visit and had a blast. It was a good feeling to get over that anxiety.  I also got on Wicked Twister this visit and I think I liked it a little more than Dragster. It was more intense but still very re-rideable and you can’t beat its location on the beach. I rode Wind Seeker next door for the first time and enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Okay, time to talk about Rougarou. My first ride, in the rain, had quite a bit of head banging in the second half. I came off acknowledging that it was much better than Mantis but feeling a little disappointed. However, I rode it many more times throughout my visit and those rides were much better with very little head banging. I love how fast it runs through the course without that awful trim brake. On most of my rides it even coasted right through the MCBR. The changes in direction during the second half provide some nice pops of air. I like it but surprisingly I think I like the other floorless coasters I’ve ridden better. Maybe I didn’t get the right seat (Though I tried different ones including the outer seats) but none of the inversions provided much hang time which is something I love about most B&Ms. Either way it’s a huge improvement over Mantis and I’m glad it’s at the park. I got some night rides in on my last day which were great. On a related note I tried the Rougabrew beer but wasn’t a big fan. I guess I expected something with a little more bite to it; it wasn’t bad really, just boring. I wish I could have taken the bottle home as a souvenir because the label was cool.  When I rode Mean Streak I spent a good portion of my first ride scanning the open center of the huge structure which serves as a work area for the park. My heart skipped a beat when I saw from a far what I thought were long orange rails (RMC track?) but upon closer inspection when the train went by the area I realized they were just orange posts. As a Mean Streak fan I’m not sure I want RMC to convert it but it still would have been cool to see something.  On my final day I got four night rides on Millennium Force with hardly any wait. I also got to ride it in the rain on night one. Millennium really shines at night. I like it a lot but considering it’s my first and only giga coaster at the moment I don’t feel I’m in a position to say much about it until I can compare it to others. The highlight of my trip was my very last ride, a night ride on Magnum. It gave me some of the most violent and uncontrolled air time I’ve ever felt. This was likely due to the lack of trims on the turn around. It reminded me once again why it’s my all time favorite.  Cedar Point has so much sentimental value to me. I loved spending 2.5 days there because in addition to an amazing amount of coaster rides (It helped that storm threats scared away the crowds) I got to slow down and enjoy the little things; walking around getting pictures, riding the train, visiting the museum, sharing my breakfast with the birds while watching the coasters roar by, riding all the flats…this really isn’t a park that should be rushed through. I can’t wait to see what 2016 brings. Considering the “wall of coasters” only has Rougarou left to add I hope an announcement will come soon. Whatever comes next I’ll be there next year to ride it!"
rollercoasters,3dsmqk,AGiantEgg,3,Sun Jul 19 01:48:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to Ohio and Cedar Point for the first time in just about a week and a half and this only makes me even more hyped.  As a New Jersey resident I've been to Great Adventure a lot and your comment and writing on TTD got me thinking about my parallels to KDK. I don't think I've been riding quite as long or as much as you have but I had finally been starting to build a bit of a coaster ego as my fears dissipated. Only thing was that KDK still got to me. I kinda stalled riding it as I hit stuff like El Toro and Nitro instead. Eventually I figured I just gotta get on. And as soon as I strapped in, well, I was ready. It's odd how any nervousness I may have is completely gone as soon as I sit down.  I'm curious as to how the lap bar on TTD makes a difference. Also excited to hit my first giga. I've never been given the opportunity to ride one until now and damn I am excited. Not only that, but we're headed up north to Toronto and Canada's Wonderland after we're done in Ohio, so I'll be given the opportunity to ride my second giga in a week's span with Leviathan.  Anyways, nice photos! This just gave me my opportunity to rant about my excitement I guess. I think the people here can understand that. haha."
rollercoasters,3dsmqk,Perceptes,3,Sun Jul 19 07:02:36 2015 UTC,Trust me I understand. I type my trip reports out in Word first and this one was close to three pages long. I could talk about coasters forever!  That's interesting we both had similar experiences with our first Intamin accelerators and that we both felt calm as soon as we were actually on the ride. I expected to get some pre launch jitters but I was just excited for what lay ahead! I predict that you'll really like Dragster's lap bars and that I'll be slightly annoyed by Ka's OTSR but who knows?   You're gonna have a blast at Cedar Point. Come back and share any pics you take at the parks with us and/or write up a trip report!

I had my legs lock up before the drop, my body went into panic mode. After the drop, it's like riding the worlds best made ride, especially getting to go under that tunnel that you don't think you'll make it under. The airtime hills are simple amazing.

I agree about the staff; they were controlling access to the stations pretty strictly and trying to keep all the rows full, especially on Fury, which had a crazy crowd. Actually, all of the rides I went on had absurdly long lines. It even rained pretty heavily in the middle of the day, and this stopped no one. The only reason I was able to get on Fury so many times is because I splurged on Fast Lane. Looking around at the other riders on Fury, I noticed nearly all of them had the Fast Lane wristband on. It seems that's the only way to ride it on a weekend. Oh well that's capitalism :/"

I feel like it is a no brainer to go to Cedar Point if it is just one. However, if you are driving I would highly recommend stopping by either Conneaut Lake Park or Waldameer on the way. Every time I drive from New Jersey to Ohio/Michigan I always stop by on the way because it breaks up the drive, it's cheap, and really fun. I would personally choose Conneaut because it is more ""on the way"", cheaper, fun, and not likely to still exist in a few years. You could also do one on the way and one on the way back."

Instead of stopping by a rest area, I feel that $5 to ride Blue Streak, adding not much more than 30 minutes to the trip and save money by avoiding the Ohio Turnpike is well worth it. It makes the option of going to Cedar Point sound more enticing. The other 3 parks are all fun but Cedar Point has that certain prestige about it."

But some good floaty bits in between are fantastic too. Wicked Cyclone's third inversion is the most absurdly peaceful moment I've ever had. You float for almost the entire element.

I don't want to float in my seat a bit as we meander over the hills of a new-gen B&M hyper, I want to be ejected like a 5-year-old when an obese person lands on the AquaLauncher. The lapbar should be the only thing preventing me from an untimely death.  That's one of the reasons I loved Skyrider at CW so much. A stand-up roller coaster with very frequent ejector air."

rollercoasters,3dpckk,Harakou,3,Sat Jul 18 11:27:54 2015 UTC,"I love floater; feeling weightless is just incredible and gives you that crazy sensation in your stomach.

rollercoasters,3dpckk,The_DILinator,2,Sat Jul 18 08:55:44 2015 UTC,"Good topic!  One I've thought about a lot, and thought of posting myself!   My personal stance is difficult to fit in one category or the other...  I definitely enjoy sweet, sweet ejector air, and coasters like El Toro, Phantom's Revenge, and Shivering Timbers are all nestled securely in my top 7 coasters due in large part to that factor.    However, my VERY favorite coasters are ones that combine multiple elements of coaster goodness, and not just crazy ejector air.  The Voyage is just a flat out insane coaster that provides an out of control rider experience that as I marathoned it earlier this year at Holiwood Nights, I best correlated to what it must be like to bull ride.  Maverick is in many ways, the steel coaster that best simulates the experience you get on The Voyage, and is right up there in my Top 3.   Yet, height and speed are awesome factors as well, and that's why my top two coasters are Fury (which has it all - speed, airtime, laterals, and excellent interaction with the environment around it), and Millennium Force (in spite of little in the way of sustained airtime).    While they don't populate my Top 10, I do love B&M Hypers, and the wonderful floater air they provide!  I do not discount these coasters at all, nor label them as ""tame"" simply because repeated rides don't leave me bruised from ejector air (here's looking at you, Skyrush and Magnum!).  That is the great fallacy in this debate that I see rage among enthusiasts.  Floater airtime is JUST AS MUCH valid airtime, and in many ways more so, than ejector airtime.  You certainly spend more time out of your seat on floater, and there's something so cool about floating - especially coming over the top of the hill while sitting in the back of a giant coaster like Fury or MF!  TL;DR (which is a concept that I hate, BTW - read it all!  Reading is good for you!) - I really like both ejector and floater, and while my favorite coasters seem to have ejector air, I don't discount the legitimacy of floater air, and love coasters like B&M Hypers that provide it!"
rollercoasters,3dpckk,InvertedPrey,2,Sat Jul 18 10:11:04 2015 UTC,"I've experienced my fair share of each. I have to say, unlike the majority of enthusiasts, I really prefer the floating sensation over the more brief, extreme air. Something about that really long floating sensation that just gets me."
rollercoasters,3dpckk,wykah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:19:02 2015 UTC,My opinion varies depending on the freedom of movement you're given as a rider. If you're clamped in the eject experience is only going to hurt your thighs as they're pushed into the bar. If you're given room to be ejected it can be the greatest feeling.
rollercoasters,3dpckk,scottwalker88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:23:11 2015 UTC,Floater airtime always.
rollercoasters,3dpckk,vinciblechunk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:12:08 2015 UTC,"I prefer floater, especially on rides like Nitro and Diamondback that do it well. The middle rows on Diamondback get a good five seconds of float on the first hill. It's like gravity goes on a short holiday. I'm guessing the track follows roughly the same parabolic trajectory that you'd get if you just threw the train into the air."
rollercoasters,3dpckk,ExactlyUnlikeTea,2,Sat Jul 18 12:46:27 2015 UTC,I love Nitro for its floater. That weightless feeling is breathtaking.

Fury 325 has both with the banked hills giving good floater( plus laterals) and the ejector at the end completes the coaster.
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,InvertedPrey,9,Fri Jul 17 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think it's fair to complain about enthusiasts' petty arguments with each other or the division of the community without mentioning that literally EVERY OTHER hobby is more or less the same way. It sucks but it's definitely not exclusive to coaster fans. I don't have an answer as to why people feel the need to be so negative and treat each other like crap when they should be trying to befriend and politely converse with others who share their passion but I guess some people can't respect those with different opinions and feel the need to argue. What it comes down to is you just have to find the good people and the good communities and stick with them.  I really hope ACE, along with their spirit of preservation, doesn't die out as younger people join some of the flashier (And sometimes much less respectable) groups. I don't see why age should matter when it comes to enjoying the company of fellow enthusiasts and I don't care if everyone in the group is 22 or 62 as long as they're kind but I guess a lot of people my age don't feel that way. It's too bad and I'm not sure what ACE can do about it."
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,Imaginos64,6,Fri Jul 17 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"Geeks are geeks, and they can really be assholes to each other.  Honestly, one of the things that Gamergate (at least the ""news ethics!"" bit) reminds me of is that long ago and far away I used to write about amusement parks for a news outlet. I was not allowed to publish a negative story (about other park guests, not even the park itself) because we might lose our press credentials. They were constantly held over our heads. We would have had more leeway as Robb Alvey, but not everybody can be Theme Park Review.  There are some other serious critiques to make of this and other fan communities, of course (racism and sexism come to mind), not to mention that nobody even remembers that not too long ago enthusiasts did their dead level best to ride with little to no restraints. Then somebody died and everything changed. When Geauga Lake was closing the enthusiast community was on SERIOUS outs with the parks. Prior to that, enthusiast events at many parks were ran with practically no rules. After? Many were cancelled. Sites lost access. It was, quite honestly, a time when it wasn't clear if parks would continue having special events for clubs at all. It was in THAT atmosphere that people were trying to save Geauga Lake and the Big Dipper, when parks were reminding us that we had behaved badly (and we had) and hadn't followed safety guidelines so they weren't sure they wanted to continue to deal with us.   So it was a little more complicated than ""enthusiasts are assholes who don't stand for anything."" I don't even know that people REMEMBER why things are the way they are right now. :/"
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,ProffieThrowaway,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think this community has to fight some general negative connotations to begin with, so more petty and immature segment of us brings the entire group down even more."

Kudos to whoever wrote this because it's rare to see such nuanced and insightful commentary on this sort of thing.  The timing of reading this is perfect for me because I've really been frustrated lately with some of the things discussed in the article as it related to Thunder Road and other ride closings.  Huge example of most people I see online chastising those who don't get on board with what the park is doing and cite the business case, cheerleading the park.    I think one thing that holds back the coaster enthusiast community as compared to the other entertainment fan communities mentioned is that the parks have the carrot of ERT events and media day invites and ACE and others are scared to risk losing them.  I got really steamed the day Thunder Road was announced because ACE posted on Facebook very matter of factly about it without showing even the slightest concern despite the fact that the first point of their mission statement says ""foster and promote the conservation, appreciation, knowledge, and enjoyment of the classic wooden roller coaster and the contemporary steel roller coaster.""    Everybody now seems to have the attitude of being too cool to care about things."
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,CurbYourNewUrbanism,3,Fri Jul 17 18:16:13 2015 UTC,"You bring up a really good point. I guess ACE doesn't want to start an argument or alienate people by making an ""official"" statement when they're a group of so many who inevitably all feel a different way about things. Plus as you said it's important for them to stay in good favor with parks. It's a tricky situation.  What makes me sad is when people are so focused on arguing or proving their point constantly that you no longer get any sense of true passion or excitement emitting from them when it comes to something that's supposed to be so dear to us, that we all dedicate so much time to discussing and participating in and that ultimately is supposed to be about having fun."

That's probably the way they (and I guess by 'they' I should really say 'we', since ACE is a member driven organization, which is one of the good things about it) see it too, but I don't see it as that tricky.  Their mission statement, which presumably anyone who joins the club supports, is very brief:    -foster and promote the conservation, appreciation, knowledge, and enjoyment of the classic wooden roller coaster and the contemporary steel roller coaster; -to create fellowship among its members; -and to promote the continued operation of roller coasters.    If that's not the mission anymore then there should be a vote to change it, because from what I can tell over the 13 or so years I've been a member, the mission is to be a free mouthpiece for the parks in order to get ERT and access to media events.  And hey, that's great too, and I've reaped the benefits of it myself for years. I've become very spoiled thanks to ACE events.  But for anyone to say that preservation is still the primary mission of ACE makes me laugh out loud.  I may be being a little harsh given that they did try to work something out for Big Dipper.  Maybe they pick their battles carefully, but ACE has been pretty quiet the last few years as wooden coaster after wooden coaster have met their demise."
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,CurbYourNewUrbanism,4,Fri Jul 17 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that it's easy for someone like the author of this article to lament over the community's lack of action but what are he, and you, and I too for that matter going to do to actually get shit done?   It's already been said that the club is having trouble attracting the younger crowd; if they fall out of favor with parks and lose out on ERT, media day invites, and other special events it spells certain death for a group that already has a bit of struggle ahead of them. Like it or not a lot of people join solely to enjoy those perks and that's what I mean by ""a group of many with different opinions"". I'm not saying ACE should give in and suck up to everyone in the industry for perks (And yes, I agree with you that some sadness should have been conveyed in the Thunder Road post at the very least) but at the same time if they piss off the big names in the business and it leads to the demise of the group then they won't be around to preserve or promote anything. That makes it a tricky situation in my opinion."
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,Imaginos64,2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"There are several parks (not particularly amusement parks, but living museums and such) around the country that already have carousels. I've always thought that if they bought and agreed to operate older coasters it would be amazing. They'd be there to ride (probably expensive, but still) and also to educate people about the way braking systems used to work or how rides were designed.  Contacting them, talking to them about that, doing feasibility studies--those are all things that a small group of enthusiasts could easily do."

rollercoasters,3dn5l5,AGG1987,5,Fri Jul 17 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"I have been a part of the coaster enthusiasts and I can say with certain that I may have just hit a bad group but this is one hobby I have had to abandon. I can say with certain this is one group that behaves in public just like they do online. I personally feel that the whole coaster enthusiast community went down after the holiday world incident. After that everything changed. To be fair SOME coaster enthusiasts were doing dangerous things, including unbuckling seatbelts to get more airtime, and the peer pressure to do this was great. Some people would reach over and undo the belt for their seat mate even if they didn't want to. This was among a group of adults mostly in their 40s so they were more than old enough to know better.  I was something like 22 years old at the time, why is it that I know that it's unsafe to undo a belt and the people who are older than me do not. While I do not care about the age difference if we all enjoy the same thing it's all good for me but others don't agree. I would NEVER engage in any unsafe behavior on a ride and I never have. There were 2 very nice and sensible people in our group, however, the rest were ahem.... Yeah.  This was the single most immature group of people I have ever seen in my life, I am talking whining because you didn't get to ride in the yellow car on the coaster because yellow is the person's favorite color....  Attracting the young people will be extremely difficult these days, it's very expensive to go to theme parks and membership is another cost. Most 20 something's dont have the money for this. When the group is mostly older it's hard to attract the young people as well. This economy doesn't really support it for the target age group unless they come from a rich family. I don't think young people are that interested in coasters these days.  I still love parks, but I don't participate in the community anymore. I can go to parks just fine without being a part of this group. I visit mostly local smaller parks where I don't need ERT to be happy."
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,SaraAB87,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree with you more. My experience was similar, except most of the older men I met were racist (like seriously members of the KKK and openly talked about it), and loved to treat park staff like crap. I'm getting back into the hobby by visiting small parks in the east and love the rides, but was upset to find out that ACE would be at the opening day of Knoebel's. I didn't want to listen to enthusiast after enthusiast ask the workers at Phoenix if the ride went fucking upside down, because the worker is required to answer and they think it's funny. :("
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,ProffieThrowaway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:43:58 2015 UTC,"My area is very poor and even the $25-30 admission of the more affordable parks is beyond the reach of most in my area especially when considering a family of four. That doesn't include extras like parking and food and over here one hotdog is $10 unless you pack your own food. Traveling to a park is very expensive and just beyond reach as is membership into this organization. I really don't want to berate a whole organization and I was never a member of ACE but it was another local group but many members were members of both. Someone in my group also committed suicide (thankfully, not on a coaster or ride). But the bad far outweighs the good in this case.  I have never seen peer pressure to undo a seatbelt or commit another crazy stunt that was so great before, it would be so easy to give in. Thankfully they have cameras on the lift hill on coasters these days to prevent this.  I would like to say I just had a very bad experience but I am a member of another community in which I am basically the only female involved and I haven't had a problem yet and no i am not THAT type of girl lol. Well there are other females, it's just a community where the females wouldn't bother to go online to talk about it. I also frequent anime conventions where I find everyone extremely welcoming even if I go by myself. I would definitely recommend the anime crowd to anyone. At least our local group is pretty fabulous. Yes, you get the people who will declare love for a character but overall they are harmless. Also no anime experience is necessary, if you like either gaming, anime or comics or superheroes you are good even if you just like something a little bit (casual gaming) it's fine.  I would not want to berate a park employee, I could never survive a day as a ride op physically so I have all the respect for these people. I don't know of any parks around here that have these ERT events, it's just too much risk for the parks to hold this type of event. I am guessing only very large parks have these events. If you just go to a good park you will be happy and you won't need the events. If you are local to a park you can easily pick a slow day and ride a ton. When I was younger I did 60 laps on a coaster in one day. I would not do that again though! I try to respect retail and service workers as much as possible, unless they are being a complete asshole to me which is a rare event if it happens at all.   I do read the thread for our one local park on TPR and that is it, just so I can see if it's worth it or not to go there.. It's not."
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,SaraAB87,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"It's been a very long time now, but I had a fellow use an allen wrench to pop open his restraint on a lift hill next to me on a wooden coaster, and I SCREAMED and slammed that damn thing right back into his lap, effectively stapling him. And then I realized he WANTED it up. Oops! There were pictures running around of people with restraints on Superman left almost all the way up--I was too scared to try that. Wooden coasters nearly always had the restraints left up at some events. And if you were a member of the media, especially from a park site, you were REALLY expected to do all this crap.   I was 21-22 and stupid and went along, but really the best rides are those that feel good even without all that bullshit. Anybody who thinks you have to ride with a restraint up to have a good time hasn't ridden on Phoenix. :)   I do miss Geauga Lake though, so damned much sometimes. :( We got tickets for free when it was Six Flags from being ""AOL Members"" and just fell in love with the place. Short lines, good food from the leftover Sea World stuff, animals, water park--there was literally nothing not to love."
rollercoasters,3dn5l5,ProffieThrowaway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"This is my first time posting on anything roller coaster related in years. I will agree with you on the anime part. I was part of the anime group at college and we were pretty open to anything. I would sit in the back of the room and watch hockey instead of watching anime and they didn't care. They even made me treasurer. That was how welcoming they are.     I started off with that to show the complete opposite side of the spectrum with the roller coaster community. It was pretty good when I was 13. I may have just not realized it then, or it was that internet was just developing. I have found that it isn't so much the group as a collective that makes the community terrible, it's the owners of the websites that dictate what you're supposed to think and the rest of the community openly (I am sure they do not feel that way on the inside) abuses people who have opposing opinions to that of the owner.     I have met great friends out of this and a highly recommend anyone just getting into this hobby to go on an organized trip to meet people but then just abandon ship once you meet the friends from the trip.     The biggest problem I have with the community is that everyone seems to have low self esteem and somehow needs to make them feel superior. I enjoy talking to people about rides and parks and would love to hear about your trip to whatever park and find out how the experience was, how busy it was, if the latest coaster is good or not, you know.. general chit chat. Instead people after discovering that you like roller coasters will say ""I've been on over 200 coasters"" and I'll tell them how many I've been on and they give me this face and attitude because I've been on more. I really don't care, you've been to parks I haven't and yet the next step the fellow enthusiasts tend to do is try to quiz me about who made what ride, or stupid trivia and get mad when I know the answers.     I remember the big dipper event. I am not sure I agree that was that they were ""bad enthusiasts"". I know some groups felt that way, but to me, it was mostly that there was no plan. Some websites acted very childish about it instead of just dismissing it as ""so, they want our help, but they have no plan. Come up with a realistic plan first, then we'll talk.""    I just don't identify with the community any more and I am having a pretty great time having fun at parks with friends I've met."

Not everyone can afford to go to parks around the world to ride every coaster and for the younger crowd they haven't been born when some rides were around. I don't care about the trivia either.    I have also had my seatbelt come off on coasters before and I am still alive today, but I wouldn't want to take it off on purpose."

rollercoasters,3dn5l5,bassististist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"Wow!  What an excellent article!  I'm truly amazed that this has been out there all these years, and I'm just now discovering it!  Thanks, /u/InvertedPrey!   I could post a similarly sized post as this article right now on this subject matter, but nobody would read it, and I don't have the time at this moment.  Suffice it to say, the writer is spot on, both in regard to the villainy of Cedar Fair in the Geagua Lake matter (and no, I don't think that's overstating things), as well as the second half pertaining to enthusiasts and their clubs!  I will say a few things regarding the matters he brought up, however...  First off, I too, was a dedicated Cedar Fair fanboy, back in the day.  I grew up believing Cedar Point was the greatest place on earth, and literally dreamed about going there when I was young.  Once I was on my own, and especially once I got married, and discovered this online community of enthusiasts, I felt at home, and eagerly joined, and started traveling the country to ride as many roller coasters as I can.  I still thought Cedar Fair was the cream of the crop, and could do no wrong, especially in comparison to Six Flags.    I too (like the article's writer) am from Michigan, and while I go to Cedar Point far more than Michigan's Adventure, I guess it's technically my ""home park.""  I was reasonably excited, given CF's track record with their other parks, by their acquisition of this small park, simply brimming with potential, and looked forward to what the future held.  Sadly, that ""future"" has essentially held nothing, except for minor aesthetic improvements at the park (which were needed, and appreciated), removal of flat rides (more disconcerting), and the addition of ZERO new roller coasters (Thunderhawk, in spite of the GP's naivete, doesn't count in my book, and is more of an insult to MiA than not adding anything at all!) in spite of having more land to do so than most parks.  Adding insult to injury, it is widely known to be the chain's most profitable park, and throwing the faithful fans of the park a bone every few years and adding an exciting new ride, re-investing some of that profit, would certainly not kill Cedar Fair.  However, they are a money-making business first, and customer-pleasing business second, and what happened with GL made that all abundantly clear!  It was when the GL incident went down, that the cracks in the armor of my perception of CF's infallibility began, and in the ensuing years, I have become resolute in my distaste for their ""business"" practices even more.  Are they better than Six Flags?  Yes, but that gap is shrinking.  As Six Flags makes better decisions, yet still doesn't ignore certain smaller parks of theirs, they grow more and more attractive in my opinion all the time.      I think the thing that is the most sobering about the GL closing, and the subsequent treatment of MiA in the years since, is the cold, stark realization that there IS something more insidious at work here regarding Cedar Fair.  These two things are linked, in that they are both pretty obvious (except to the most stubborn, hard-headed, and resolute enthusiast shill) indicators that Cedar Fair intentionally  bought GL with the intention to close it (I don't buy any protestations to the contrary, and the timeline doesn't really support those protestations either), and intentionally bought MiA with the intention to stunt any potential for growth it clearly had.  After Shivering Timbers was added, a world class wooden coaster that destroys anything Cedar Point has ever had in that department, they realized that it was a park that was going to be a thorn in their side when it comes to monopolizing that Michigan market that they long held.  Buying the park, and then blatantly holding it back for going on 15 years now has succeeded in keeping Michiganders focused on Cedar Point every year, and only making the trek over to MiA periodically to enjoy their awesome water park, and give the kiddies something to do.    The enthusiast community, as indicated in this article, has been complicit in this travesty, as they have indeed slathered in ridicule anybody who dares to state the obvious, as I have just done here, and have pontifically decried those who post such things as being out of touch with the amusement park industry, or ignorant of business principles.  However, I am very strong in the business aspect of things, and as such, recognize this for exactly what it is: a calculated, and very shrewd business move by CF that has absolutely no warm fuzzies at the core of it for the fans of parks like GL (obviously), and MiA (wake up people, if you aren't already.)  Just because you don't NEED to do something, doesn't mean you shouldn't, and just because MiA is making a profit without any additions, doesn't mean they shouldn't make any additions.  Heck, Cedar Point is living proof of this!  They developed a trend, especially through the 90's, of adding a major new coaster every other year like clockwork.  Did they need to do this to be a major destination?  No, certainly not!  But they did it because they cared about making the park as good as they possibly could, and rewarding their fan base.  You see this done at their other ""crown jewel"" parks still.  But not at their small parks, because they have no interest in catering to the fans of those places, other than to keep them coming so they can essentially subsidize their bigger parks...   OK, now I've gone on WAY too long for this forum, and only touched barely on the first of the two issues addressed by this article!  I'll keep this one focused on this aspect, and I'll respond specifically to the enthusiast issue more directly in another post here.  Thanks to any of you who have stayed with me this far, and hopefully I didn't step on too many of your toes with this controversial, but I feel very confident accurate, assessment of Cedar Fair, and their wanton treatment of GL and MiA."

rollercoasters,3dn5l5,The_DILinator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"Again, excellent article on the subject matter, and props to the poster for sharing it!    Pertaining to his points about the enthusiast ""morals"", I am also in agreement with what he has seen.  While early on, I wore the title of Roller Coaster Enthusiast with pride, I grew tired of that after seeing what all this community really entailed.  I do not currently identify as a ""Coaster Enthusiast"", though I obviously love roller coasters, and have resumed posting about them online.  I did take an extended break, however, posting nothing online about coasters for over 8 years until starting again with this very reddit a couple of months ago.  I felt this community is at least less controlled, and more friendly and open to expression of free thought, than some of the more popular sites.  I think that is a credit to you, redditers!    I see a lot of people mentioning TPR or ACE here in complaints, but as an online community, I think those are not the worst offender when it comes to this problem of being filled with what I will call a ""culture of enthusiasses.""  That distinction, clearly lies with another popular site and club, and if you aren't familiar with them yet, do yourself a favor, and don't bother!  I won't mention them by name, because that's just not my style, but I will describe them still.  I have often wondered over the years of observing them, whether they could possibly be remotely like they are online, in person.  Because in real life, attitudes like are frequently displayed there are not associated with being ""cool"", or friendly, or anything other than being a tool, or an a-hole of a human being.  I stopped posting there eons ago due to this problem, but continue to observe as a lurker (there are decent things about the site and their knowledge base as well - just don't expect to be treated with decency if you propose an idea that runs counter to the ""Coaster Enthusiast Morals"" espoused in this article.)  Or if you're not part of the accepted inner-clique there.    One thing I think is funny, is that most of the people in online coaster enthusiast groups espouse a lot of liberal ideas, and decry capitalism at every opportunity if it's a political issue.  However, when it comes to amusement parks, they literally shill for the parks over-capitalistic tendencies at every turn, displaying mind-numbing hypocrisy compared to their other leanings.  As the writer of this article mentioned, it's all obviously because they don't want to lose the relations with the parks they enjoy, so they'll overlook, and honestly (since I think many of them believe the tripe they say) delude themselves into thinking that the parks know what they are doing, and are doing it out of the soundness of their business sense, and desire to put the best product out there for their customers.    Speaking to actual observed behavior, I am always shocked at ""enthusiast"" events, how un-enthusiastic most of the enthusiasts appear.  When I am on a roller coaster, you know I am loving it, because I am making that pretty obvious in my enjoyment.  So many ""enthusiasts"", however, look they could be sitting on their couch, watching their least favorite teacher from school drone on about something entirely boring.  And yet they are riding an amazing coaster!  And then there are the attitudes, and entitlement displayed towards the parks, and others, that is nauseating.  I love events, and the perks that come with them.  But I continue to be shocked at how so many in the culture act.  I guess it is truly indicative of ""geek-culture"", as another poster here pointed out, but still...    I could create a whole post of ""Things coaster enthusiast morals say, that are simply not true"" (And maybe I will!), but I do have a life outside of online forums, and I need to wrap up, and attend to that.  So much more could be said on this matter, but I'll hold off for now.  Maybe in the comments below at some point.  I just wanted to say I appreciate the community we have here, and while it may not be a snazzy as some of the other sites, I think the culture seems a little bit better, and more accepting.  And that is a credit to you all!  :)"

Close seconds are my first and only time on el toro.  I got stuck on the lift hill for half an hour, and the ride ops came up and gave us water and were very entertaining.  The time I slouched and stuck my gut out on Apollos chariot and had my calves hold me into the seat at the lapbar(i'm stupid).  Getting to ride Thunderbolt and jackrabbit with my stepson.  Riding Drachenfire.  And maybe the time that i was going to propose on i305, but chickened out and did it somewhere else.  3rd place is my one and only trip to cedar point in the middle of august... Got there 1 hour before general public opening, but had a platinum pass.  Rode MF 5 times, gatekeeper 4 times, maverick 3 times, twisted spike thing 2 times and all the other coasters once.

The weather was great, but the park was pretty empty. Additionally the attractions ran until 11:00 PM. So we basically planned to get the last ride, as we always do, and managed to have the best timing of our lifes: The ending of the Summernights was always marked by fireworks. When we were in the station we heard the fireworks going off and were a little dissapointed. But then on the ride we basically flew through the green mist the fireworks caused.  Riding one of the best rollercoasters in the world, at night (wich is double awesome because Holiday Park is placed in a forest) with 3 great guys through the mist of fireworks was an unique opportunity.  Another one that stands out was my second ride on Troy, Toverland. A buddy and I were on a rollercoaster trip through Belgium and the Netherlands and were so psyched for Troy. We were so psyched in fact, that we didn't let rain stop us. It was pretty cold and we got super wet but man, it was worth it."

Went to IoA right at opening, walked onto Hulk 3 times (once in row 1, twice in row 2- thing kicked my ass), rode Dragon Challenge 4 times, and took a couple of rides on Mummy at UO as well. Went back for a couple of hours after dinner last night, rode Dragon Challenge 5 more times in a row (one of the few coasters I can do that on regularly, thanks to the smoothness and generally short lines), took one last ride on Hulk in row 6 (did not kick my ass). Didn't ride RRR once, because I never caught it with a reasonable line (thing is only average IMHO).  Both Dragon Challenge coasters kick serious ass in the front and back. Fire especially kicks ass in the back, Ice is the better of the two in the front. The line was about 10 minutes long for the front last night, while everything else was a walk-on, so I ended up doing Fire in the back three times last night.  Not my favorite ride experience ever, but one of my better park experiences in recent memory, and my best coaster derby in ages."

rollercoasters,3dmso2,Ewok_Soap,11,Fri Jul 17 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"Trust me Holiday World is worth it. Everyone has different tastes in coasters so I'm usually hesitant to make blanket statements but The Voyage is honestly one of those rides I can't possibly see anyone not falling in love with. They have two other very solid wooden coasters and their new launched wing coaster, Thunderbird, is a blast as well. I've heard good things about their water coasters too if you're into water parks. Holiday World in general has a special charm to it and is a very pleasant park to visit. You won't regret going even if you have to drive a little out of your way.   Cedar Point is always worth the trip and King's Island looks that way too. I've been to Great America twice and though I enjoyed it, both times (Week days) it was PACKED to the point where it got a little over whelming. When you go don't miss out on The Whizzer; it's a fun and special classic."

rollercoasters,3dmso2,The_DILinator,3,Sat Jul 18 04:59:54 2015 UTC,"Holiday World is truly amazing - one of the best parks in the world in spite of its size!  It is WAY out of the way, but definitely worth it, if you can afford the time and money!    Interestingly enough, there are two other little parks that are really not too far off your path, assuming you're coming across I-90 from Cedar Point to Six Flags Great America.    You'll come across US 31 just past South Bend, Indiana.  If you head north just over 2 hours, you'll reach Michigan's Adventure.  It's not the greatest park ever, but Shivering Timbers is amazing (my third favorite wooden coaster after The Voyage and El Toro), and their water park is very nice!  You're not too far away, and if you're not coming back up this way again, you might as well hit it up.  Then, just under two hours south on 31 (and a cut over on a couple of other highways), is Indiana Beach.  It was a pretty cool little park built almost right on top of a lake, but I have heard it's gone downhill since I've been there.  However, they do still have some pretty cool and unique coasters, and would also not be out of the way if you were heading down to Holiday World after visiting Six Flags Great America.   Lastly, if you do go down to Holiday World, on your return to Maryland, you'd go right by Kentucky Kingdom, so if you have time, it's probably worth hitting.  I haven't been there personally yet, but I've heard things about it since it's reopened!    Hope this helps!"

rollercoasters,3dkj7o,scottwalker88,3,Fri Jul 17 00:42:02 2015 UTC,I just went today and rode it for the first time...it was so absolutely incredible! We went on it 8 times and now my throat hurts!
rollercoasters,3dkq25,Imaginos64,4,Fri Jul 17 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"My original plan for my first ever Holiday World trip was to get there at opening, hit Thunderbird a few times before lines got long, book it over to Halloween for The Raven and The Legend, ride The Voyage as a finale, then do re-rides as I saw fit. However, you know what they say about the best laid plans…  In reality the only part of that plan that came to fruition was being in the park by opening. As I stood in the 4th of July section waiting for the ropes to drop I couldn’t resist looking up the weather on my phone. It called for thunderstorms all day. Meanwhile the sky was getting darker. Not a good sign. At rope drop I headed to Thunderbird but as I walked past The Voyage to the start of the path leading up to the coaster we were all stopped by an employee who informed us that Thunderbird would be down for the day. She mentioned that The Legend would be down as well. A light rain began as I saw an empty train thunder by on The Voyage. I might not get on anything else that day but I’d be damned if I drove sixteen hours to miss out on The Voyage.  I jumped in the coaster’s short line, choosing the last row of the train as the drizzle turned into a downpour. I couldn’t help but feel a little grumpy. No Thunderbird, no Legend, and who knew how many Voyage rides I would get before the weather forced it down. Still, as the train dispatched and I found myself heading upward into the storm those feelings melted away into excitement. I knew I was in for something special.   The first drop was fantastic; I floated down the whole thing and it felt like I was forced back into my seat by the pounding rain. I kept my hands up for the first two drops but soon found them around my eyes, trying and failing to keep the rain out. We thundered through the tunnels, which allowed me only brief moments of regained vision. After that I gave up and kept my eyes shut. The train was moving impossibly fast and I had no idea what was going on, just that it was absolutely incredible and I was lucky enough to be along for the ride. We hit the mid course brakes which unfortunately completely stopped the train. This happened on all of my rides and is my one complaint about the coaster. Still, I was surprised that the train regained its speed almost immediately. The first tunnel was pitch black due to the storm and though I’d watched the POV many times the last drop caught me off guard and provided some of the most enjoyable air time I’ve yet to experience.   I love the ride’s finale and for its length it never gets boring for a second, which is quite an accomplishment. As I hit the brake run I had made up my mind; The Voyage is my new #1 wooden coaster and that was one of the best rides I had had in my life.  I eagerly jumped back in line for round two but as I was seated in the train waiting for dispatch the ride op announced that the coaster had to close due to lightning in the vicinity and we were taken off the train. After about forty minutes they started cycling the trains and I jumped back on board…only to be told to get out again due to mechanical issues. Counting my Cedar Point trip a few days later this happened to me at least six times on various rides. Cue twenty more minutes of trains cycling and now the Voyage rhyme that’s played at dispatch is permanently etched into my brain.  When I finally got to ride again the rain had stopped and I was able to keep my eyes open to fully appreciate the coaster’s location and layout. I rode a couple more times (More later as well) and then headed over to The Raven…"
rollercoasters,3dkq25,jpezzznuts,4,Fri Jul 17 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"Part 2: (I did not expect to write this much but I wanted to document this memorable trip. Props to anyone actually reading this novel, haha)  I passed The Legend on my way over to The Raven and tried to see if anything was going on but there wasn’t any activity, nor an employee by the ride entrance that I could ask. Sadly the ride didn’t open that day.  Luckily I was able to get plenty of rides on The Raven. I’ve really enjoyed the CCI coasters I’ve ridden so far and this was no exception, though I do wish it were a bit longer as it feels like the brake run comes while the train still has quite a bit of speed. I was able to ride four times without getting off later on in the day since no one was in line for my row and the awesome employees actively encouraged re-rides. The Raven has a nice combo of air time and moderate laterals and is very re-rideable. I love those sweeping turns by the water. One thing that really struck me is how incredibly smooth the pull out on the first drop is. Perhaps it was re-tracked recently?  After a few rides on The Raven I decided to make my way up the hill to see Thunderbird. If I couldn’t ride it I wanted to at least admire it in person and snap a few pictures. When I reached the path leading up to it I was stopped by the same employee as before who let me know the ride was closed. I was about to say, “Thanks, I know…” when she continued on, “…but the mechanics are fairly certain it will open in a few hours”. Alright, score!  I happily killed a few hours re-riding the two open coasters, exploring the park, and eating a surprisingly delicious lunch. By then it was around three and I went to ask the employee by the hill for the latest news. She told me that the repair was taking longer than expected and the new projected opening time was around six. Considering I had six hours to drive that night I was starting to feel a little frustrated. Not at the park, whose effort to keep everyone updated was outstanding, but at the fact that I might have to leave without riding this new coaster. I killed some more time and walked up the path to Thunderbird around six thirty. I couldn’t wait much longer; if the ride didn’t start testing I would have to give up. My stubborn nature kept me waiting along with the voice in the back of my head telling me that if I left I would almost certainly see the coaster testing as I was driving away, and how awful would that be? Finally a couple of ride ops walked past where I was sitting and entered Thunderbird’s station. Then I saw an amazing sight; Thunderbird’s train inching out of the station, down the launch track. It rolled slowly down the entire length of the launch, then backwards into the station. I jumped up to get in the already forming line. A few minutes later the train settled into the launch area and shot out of the barn into the first inversion. It took another twenty minutes but finally we were allowed into the line and I was nearly running through the barn. An employee was directing everyone to the left or right but I politely asked for the left and got it. Another positive about this park; the employees are extremely friendly!  Some coasters for better or worse have introductions and anticipations tacked onto them that they have to live up to in the rider's mind and after waiting hours for this bird to fly I was ready to have my mind blown. The verdict? It’s a fantastic coaster and seems like a perfect fit for this park. The launch out of the barn, complete with thunder sound effects and mist is so much fun while sitting on the wings of the train. The inversions have great hang time, the final barrel row in particular is one of the best I’ve experienced. Of the three wing coasters I’ve ridden (Gatekeeper and X Flight being the others) this one is by far my favorite. It has a couple of slower, swooping turns that bring to mind Gatekeeper’s over all ride experience but those are pleasant enough and don’t detract from the more intense aspects of the ride such as the launch and inversions. I really wish I could have ridden it again and tried out the right side but the line was long at that point and it was getting late.   Well thanks for reading my rambling trip report! Within the next few days I’ll upload my pictures from Cedar Point and the couple decent phone pics (Left my camera at the hotel) I took at Six Flags Great America."

Even if the uncertainly of the weather was a bit stressful and the downtime annoying it ultimately worked out in my favor. That ride on The Voyage was insane and since thunderstorms were predicted for each of my 2.5 days at Cedar Point the crowds were extremely minimal. Surprisingly most their coasters there were open in the rain and there were only a couple hours total that lightning shut everything down. Besides I'd rather be running around a park soaking wet than over heated, burning in the sun."

It has also aged well and is extremely reliable (for an Intamin coaster especially).    SD2000 was SBNO for 3 years soon after it was built.  Mforce has had it's issues sure but as many times as I've visited the park, it is always operating, I don't think I've ever been and not ridden it.  Can't say that for any other major coaster there.

rollercoasters,3daknj,coasterj,2,Tue Jul 14 19:57:37 2015 UTC,The anti-rollbacks and the chain-dog are two different things.  Anti-rollbacks are the things you hear go click as the train ascends the lift hill. They prevent the train from going down the lift hill instead of up when the hill is stopped.  The chain dog is something on the train that engages the chain (thus chain dog) so that the chain can actually move the train up the lift hill.

I've always thought the big dive machines like Sheikra and Griffon looked a lot smaller than they really are just because of how much the size of the dive machine track distorts your perspective."
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,michaelbrnd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:55:07 2015 UTC,I actually found the opposite to be true when I first saw Sheikra. I thought it looked MUCH taller than it actually is.

rollercoasters,3d8k4u,The_DILinator,3,Tue Jul 14 17:03:33 2015 UTC,"I won't lie:  I will be very disappointed if Valravn is YET ANOTHER orange coaster at CP. (Not in the coaster, to be clear, just the color.)  I mean, seriously, whoever decides on coaster colors there already had proven to have very little imagination.  They may as well call it Rougarou part deux if that track is for CP's next coaster!  lol   I'm hoping it's actually for another Dive Coaster - possibly even one for Canada's Wonderland, maybe the expected Ziz (which fits the color much better, too!)  What if that layout that was leaked is actually for Ziz?  And Valravn is going to be something entirely different?  It would be an interesting twist!"
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,mynameisntjeffrey,4,Tue Jul 14 12:55:58 2015 UTC,"Wait.... Isn't rougarou the only other orange coaster at cp? I mean there's a few red like iron dragon, Magnum, and maverick, but only one other orange."
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,Jstbcool,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is the only one of two oranges. Blue and Red are used for all but 2 4 of the major coasters.

Maverick - Red w/ brown/tan? support  Rougarou - Orange w/ greenish blue? support  Wicked Twister - Yellow w/ light blue support  Raptor - Green w/ green supports"
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,mynameisntjeffrey,4,Tue Jul 14 14:27:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with too many similiae coaster colors. Where are the purple or yellow ones?!
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,TinyFoxFairyGirl,5,Tue Jul 14 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"Ooh! A purple dive machine with acid green supports, themed around a chemical accident! Much fun would be had"
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,Jstbcool,5,Tue Jul 14 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help though that Cedar Point has 16, going on a potential 17, coasters and there are really only so many color combinations that they can chose from that both fit the theme they are going for and are aesthetically pleasing to look at.  Plus most of the coasters, or at least their entrances, are far away enough from each other that you don't really notice. (With the exception of Dragster and Magnum and even still now that it's Molly Orange it's a lot better than it was)  I also remember that around 2009 or 2010 Cedar Fair released something saying they had done research about what the colors of a coaster make people feel when they're in the park and the Red/ Yellow combo made people both excited and want to spend money which whether or not that is true, you could see why Cedar Fair would want to paint their coasters that color."
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,SteamboatWillie,3,Tue Jul 14 17:39:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think the coasters actually look excellent and there isn't really a place in the park where I feel like I can confuse two coasters for being too similar in color. Rougarou was a nice change and I like the way the orange stands out from the trees behind it. Having another orange coaster added next might be a little weird, but there is enough room between those two locations it might look alright. Would be a good contrast to Raptor standing right next to it."
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,Jstbcool,2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:14 2015 UTC,"There also is the fact that if this is indeed the track for Valravn, we don't even know the support color yet, and there is also the chance this could be a primer layer of paint and not the final color. (Seeing as there is unpainted track in one pic I'd then assume they move track in and out of the plant regularly for painting so it could be that it's not done being painted yet)"

The length of the track of about 3,625 feet, according to the memo. The proposed Dive Coaster has a maximum speed of about 80 mph with a ride lasting about 195 seconds, including 30 seconds for loading and unloading of passengers. At that rate 1,310 guests per hour could ride the coaster.  B&M is designing into the ride, a vertical drop in a tunnel, an Immelmann, a 270-degree roll, a banked curve, a ""looping,"" an Immelmann with a half-roll exit, a second drop, a camel back and a spiral with a total of four inversions, according to the memo."
rollercoasters,3d8k4u,bonsaiisuperstar,3,Wed Jul 15 13:27:16 2015 UTC,I personally was hoping Valravn would be purple like Banshee...But the rustic brownish-orange/grey track I guess is okay.  Its not the same bright orange as Rougagrou so maybe this was planned out and the two dark creatures will also have track colors that compliment each other.   (The bright orange track pictured at the plant does not look like a dive machine at all...its normal sized.  I am not sure what other park is building a B&M this year other than Mako which is blue so it cannot be going to Sea World)

Certainly worth the admission on that.  My friend actually blacked out on it.  That said, if the stats are anything like those rumored, it would be a pretty good size dive machine and likely a decent experience."

Millennium, Top Thrill, and Wicked Twister were all very tight fits. Gatekeeper is the only ride that I know of at CP w/ XL seating (Rows 4 and 5 I believe). They say MF has all the same size belts, but I know in the past i've barely been able to buckle my belt in the front seat and I'll then re-ride it in the back where I can buckle and tighten my belt slightly."
rollercoasters,3d9s48,Jstbcool,3,Tue Jul 14 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"A word of wisdom, the CP ride operators cannot buckle the belt or push the harness down to the ""safe"" spot for you.  If you are with someone, they can do it for you.   The tightest seat there is Wicked Twister, follow by MF and then TTD.  On MF and TTD if you're able to get it buckled but they are still requiring the belt to be pulled some, there are a few tricks to help out if you're having issues.  Untuck your shirt from under the seatbelt, and help push/feed the seatbelt thru the buckle as you are pulling.  Hopefully you'll be able to ride.  Good luck.

It probably depends on the ride operators and how strong the person who helps you is."
rollercoasters,3d9s48,Kmac09,2,Tue Jul 14 18:51:48 2015 UTC,I would avoid Wicked Twister (those are brutally tight restraints) but otherwise you will probably be fine.  Also make sure to check out the Cedar Downs.  It is one of only 3 of those rides remaining.
rollercoasters,3d9s48,TheRealWedgeAntilles,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, consensus seems to be that Wicked Twister is the toughest one to fit into. I'm more worried about Top Thrill and Millennium Force though, those are the two I'm most looking forward to, and I generally have more trouble with lap bar restraints then OTSRs.  And don't worry, we have 3 weekdays there with fast lane plus on one of those days, so we're certainly aiming to hit everything, including Cedar Downs!"

rollercoasters,3d73tg,jpezzznuts,6,Tue Jul 14 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"Its interesting that one Marriott Park, California Great America, ended up in the Cedar Fair family whereas the other, Illinois Great America, is now with Six Flags' empire.   Some similarities between the parks include Demon (which began as Turn of the Century) and its a ride I got a kick out of at SF Great America due to its over the top lighting in the tunnel and rock formations.   If you also consider that California's Great Adventure was part of the Paramount family you have a similar pair of rides to Carowinds in Afterburn/TopGun/FlightDeck as well also Vortex. Because of this heritage you have similar coaster and ride names and also duplicate attractions across several parks. There are design layouts and aesthetic features like the pool/Carousel entrance which match other parks build in connection with CA's Great America as well. So although I have never actually been to California's Great America - I FEEL like I have experienced the park due to all the Frankenstein pieces I recognize from other parks I have visited several times including SF Great America, Kings Dominion, and Carowinds. That being said I'd like to get out there some time, especially for Gold Striker."
rollercoasters,3d73tg,theflatdog,3,Tue Jul 14 03:16:03 2015 UTC,I am utterly fascinated by the two Great Americas and how they started out as (more or less) twins and have become such different parks over the years.  This site has some pretty cool stuff on it for anyone else out there like me: http://www.greatamericaparks.com  Lots of nostalgia material. :)  Another fun fact: Did you know that a THIRD Great America was going to be built in the DC area? A few sites were being considered but it never went through.
rollercoasters,3d73tg,cominaroundthecorner,5,Wed Jul 15 16:48:41 2015 UTC,Demon was my first looping coaster. Place holds a spot in my heart as where the love began. Sad that they got rid of stealth :/ seems like the past 10 years hasn't brought major improvments. Maybe I'll go back this season. Is gold striker a worthwhile woodie? Grizzly was always  a headache after one ride.
rollercoasters,3d73tg,slrpatty,3,Tue Jul 14 02:23:49 2015 UTC,"Great America also holds a special place in my heart! Vortex was my first looping coaster and the Slime coaster was my first any roller coaster! I haven't back in years, but I heard Gold Striker is great! Also, they recently re-tracked Grizzly, so it might be much smoother now!"
rollercoasters,3d73tg,sir_squints,3,Tue Jul 14 02:51:24 2015 UTC,Flight Deck was my first invert and my first looping coaster. Loved it.
rollercoasters,3d73tg,bchris24,4,Tue Jul 14 05:16:13 2015 UTC,So glad they finally got their new woody a couple years ago. Gold Striker is awesome and all the sound proofing makes it a pretty unique ride. Which was much needed since their most recent coaster was the mouse one I believe. Now honestly they just need to burn Grizzly to the ground. There is no good reason to keep it running. Obviously I know they can't just replace w with some awesome ride just like that but it would be great.
rollercoasters,3d73tg,theflatdog,5,Tue Jul 14 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"CGA was my park as a kid and I'll always have a soft spot for it, even if I am mostly disappointed in what's happened with it since I grew up. It was awesome when the park was adding coasters back in the 90s (and then there was Stealth, which got shipped off to Carowinds. Apparently the ride has terrible capacity, but I thought it was a good ""get"" for the park at the time).  Now I just look at what Six Flags has done with SFGA and pine for what might have been. It seems like a conscious decision was made that CGA would be a family-oriented park without many thrilling rides. I don't know whether that's due to the small-ish size of the park, the fact that it has office buildings right next to it, or a desire to be different from Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, which seems like it's tried to add more thrill rides.  This enormous thread has some pretty awesome info about plans for CGA during the Paramount years that never materialized:  Concept for Speed Coaster, a Morgan hyper with an elevator-style lift: http://www.themeparkreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=40361&start=2600  Elsewhere in the thread, it's also stated that at various points in time, the original site of the Whizzer was slated for an outdoor version of the Flight of Fear coasters and Hypersonic XLC (the same one that ended up at KD).  Then there was the ""Front Gate"" project, which was going to be like a Universal CityWalk kind of thing. IMHO this might have been a great thing for Santa Clara, but what do I know:  http://www.themeparkreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=40361&start=2570  Edit: Speling"
rollercoasters,3d73tg,Jstbcool,2,Wed Jul 15 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"It absolutely has to do with bad neighbors as at least part of the factor. I don't remember which office it is, but they built next to an existing theme park and now constantly make noise complaints against the park. The reason Gold Striker took so long to get built and has so many tunnels is due to complaints from the group that owns those offices. The park is also pretty land locked, which wasn't helped by them being forced into selling part of their parking lot for the 49ers stadium. So unfortunately I wouldn't expect it to ever be a coaster mecca, but hopefully they can keep finding ways to add more to the park.  SFGAm on the other hand has always had quite a bit of land. They somewhat locked themselves in by building the giant water park onto one side of the park, but their parking lot is still big enough they could probably expand into it if needed. That was my home park as a kid and it has certainly changed quite a bit over the years."
rollercoasters,3d73tg,bchris24,2,Thu Jul 16 12:30:30 2015 UTC,The business you're thinking of is Prudential Real Estate. For a good part of the year Gold Striker was built they installed microphones all over the rooftop and in front of Windows facing the park to try and catch the ride infringing the noise limit. Thank God they didn't win in the end.
rollercoasters,3d73tg,Jstbcool,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:11 2015 UTC,I actually have a question for people who visit this park. I've read various stories that the 49'ers and the city didn't really hold up their original agreement that building the new stadium on CGA's parking lot wouldn't impact the amusement park. Then last year they agreed to close CGA whenever the 49ers have a home game. Do you think this deal has negatively impacted the park at all? Or has it impacted you when you've planned to make visits?
rollercoasters,3d73tg,bionicvapourboy,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:45 2015 UTC,"Not a coaster, but their Intamin Triple Wheel looked awesome. Shame there's none around anymore."
rollercoasters,3d73tg,Jstbcool,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:51 2015 UTC,My family always liked that ride and we rode it every visit (when SFGAm had one) until one hot day it got stuck while we were up in the air and my brother puked in our cabin. That made the wait a lot worse and is also my only memory of that ride.
rollercoasters,3d73tg,Ze_Ubermench,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:39:40 2015 UTC,"I used to go to CGA every year until recently. The Demon was my first looping coaster, but overtime the ride started to give huge headaches due to my head shaking side to side on the shoulder restraints. My favorite roller coaster there is Gold Striker. IT'S HUGE. Although not even half as big as SFMM's Goliath, it's a great fun ride!"
rollercoasters,3d5l7x,CarterGee,14,Mon Jul 13 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"What's actually there is very good...the loop, the launches, straddling the mountain, and the drop off the top of the loop.   I certainly would have loved to have seen them use the momentum of that drop to extend the ride into some bunny hills and helixes covering the excavated Log Jammer site tho...it seems like a lot of space and potential was wasted, and it's more 1/2 a ride than a complete ride, IMO."
rollercoasters,3d5l7x,bassististist,3,Mon Jul 13 18:37:13 2015 UTC,Haven't rode it yet but I agree with after the top-hat straight into a brake run.  Probably budget constraints?

All around it's a fantastic ride and I was very surprised by it."

rollercoasters,3d3yxr,LargeDarkNipplePpl,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"I can't add much since I've only been on two floorless coasters but my top two is the same as yours.   Kraken - One of the few non-hyper coasters I like in the back row.  The zero gravity roll is probably my favorite inversion on any coaster. Dominator - I also haven't ridden at KD but enjoyed it at GL   I'll be hitting up Cedar Point next week for the first time in 12 years so I'll add Rougarou to the list.  I was one of the few that seemed to love Mantis as a stand-up so I have decent expectations.  Next year I hope to add Hydra, Bizarro and if I'm lucky Batman: TDK."
rollercoasters,3d3yxr,jh5292,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:20:26 2015 UTC,I was going to say Hydra too. Really unique layout for a B&M ....Reminds me more of an Intamin looper layout.
rollercoasters,3d3yxr,beekman57,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:40:24 2015 UTC,Krypton is honestly the only one I really love.  I think most floorless are pretty forceless but some of the compact ones almost have too much punch.  I just feel like Krypton has some absolutely amazing points like the zero-g roll and man that first drop off the quarry wall.  Just a beautiful ride using the setting really well.  I hope one day it won't feel so isolated though.  The Bizarro and Scream are kinda low for me as for some reason they were less comfortable and more disorienting for me.  I had a similar issue with Batman at SFNE but there are parts I love on it.

rollercoasters,3d2vrj,Orr6177,8,Mon Jul 13 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that Maverick's restraints changed this year to a softer variant similar to Intimidator 305. The main reason for complaints on over-the-shoulder is that they are often superficial and are constricting on rider's movement and therefore insert unnecessary discomfort of disappointment.   A great comparison is KingdaKa and Top Thrill Dragster - essentially sibling coasters from same manufacturer with different restraints - with Top Thrill having much more freedom for riders to raise arms, not worry about banging their head, and give more sense of excitement without being further tied down to the train."

rollercoasters,3cuqbx,AndrewPwner,4,Fri Jul 10 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"Busch Gardens season pass holder checking in.  Busch Gardens is a lot of fun.  It doesn't have the highest quantity of roller coasters, but the ones they do have are top notch.    Apollo's Chariot is my personal favorite because of the first drop and all of the air time on the following mini-hills.  Also, there's no over-the-shoulder restraints, just a lap bar which gives you more freedom to move about instead of feeling like you're tied down.    Griffon is a great ride.  Very smooth and pretty intense.  Definitely try for the front row if the line isn't too bad.    Tempesto wasn't bad, but it also wasn't up to par with the rest of the rides at Busch Gardens.  They give you an orange fanny pack to store your loose articles in while you ride because with that slow roll, everything would fall out easily.  The slow roll is pretty cool and it's a different sensation than you get with most coasters.  The rest is pretty mediocre and it's a very short ride.  Also, getting on and off the ride is pretty difficult because there's VERY little room between the lap bar/over-the-shoulder restraints and the seat to walk through.  I'm about 5'10"" and 190lbs and I had a bit of trouble, so I can't imagine how much trouble larger people may have.  Overall, it's a good ride, but I'm never upset when I go to Busch Gardens and don't get a chance to ride it.    Alpengeist is great.  TONS of inversions, but it can be a little rough.  There are 4 seats per row.  Try sitting in one of the two seats in the center of the row as the outside is rougher than the inside seats.  Also, the part that used to always get me was when you think you're doing a full loop, but it turns out to only be a half loop then a sudden roll to the left.  I think it's a cobra roll if I'm not mistaken.  It's the 3rd loop of the ride, right after you go through a wooden tunnel.  I know when it's coming now so I can brace myself for it and don't bang my head on the restraints now.  Other than that, it's a fun ride!    Verbolten is great too.  Very smooth ride most of the way, and the part where the entire track drops to the lower level is awesome every time.  There is a bit of a rough bit after the drop over the river after the tunnel going through the turns, but nothing too bad.  Not the fastest or most intense, but a lot of cool gimmicks and it's well-themed.    Loch Ness Monster is the least intense coaster in the park (unless you count the kiddie coaster in the Sesame Street area), but still a good ride.  It's been open since 1978 so as you can imagine, it's a bit rough, but for a ride that old, it's held up pretty well.  Give it a go.  Be prepared for the heat.  It's been incredibly hot the past couple of weeks here.  There are a lot of trees in the park so there's plenty of shaded areas, but the park also has a lot of hills to walk up that will get exhausting in the heat, so be prepared for that.  Also, if you go on a Saturday, I'd also recommend the quick queue pass as it's a front-of-the line pass on most of the main rides.  They have 2 different Quick Queue passes.  One gets you to the front of the line once for all the rides listed.  The other gets you to the front of the line an unlimited number of times for the day.  I'm not up to date on the prices because I live just 10 minutes away from the park and can go anytime I want so I go on the least busy days.  If your schedule is flexible, I would try to go on a Monday-Thursday if you can.  Saturdays, as you can expect, are the busiest days.  Fridays during the day are manageable, but later in the day, it can get crowded.  Sundays are usually manageable, but seem to be hit or miss in my experiences.    As for shows, Celtic Fyre is probably the best one.  I wouldn't waste your time with London Rocks unless you have plenty of time to spare.  It's not a bad show, but it's not worth it in my opinion.  If you enjoy animals, More Pet Shenanigans is a fun show.  There's also a show in Das Festhaus called Roll Out The Barrel.  It's entertaining enough for what it is.  Das Festhaus is a large dining area with a stage propped up in the center.  It's fun to grab a bite to eat in the air-conditioning and enjoy a show.  The overall food quality in Das Festhaus is so-so and there are better places to eat if food quality is your number 1 priority, but as for the overall experience, I prefer Das Festhaus.    Overall, I love the park.  It doesn't have the most rides and you can easily do everything in a single day even on the more heavily crowded days.  The real charm of the park is the beauty and overall environment.  The landscaping is well-done, the theming of the park is excellent, and the staff does a great job keeping the park clean and maintained.  All of that makes for a memorable trip every time for me.  I hope you enjoy it and if you have any further questions that I didn't cover, feel free to ask!  EDIT: Formatting"

rollercoasters,3cuqbx,tabakers5,3,Sat Jul 11 19:08:05 2015 UTC,"If you're going to ride Alpengeist, try to ride in the front. Being able to see what's coming makes it a lot less rough.  Griffon and Apollos Chariot are must rides, they're the most intense in the park.   Verbolten is a ton of fun and offers a good change of pace from the other bigger rides.  Loch Ness Monster is a classic and the interlocking loops are pretty unique.   Beside the coasters, Mach Tower, Escape from Pompeii, Le Scoot, and Roman Rapids are a ton of fun and can help you cool off during the day (with the exception of Mach Tower)"

The roughest ride for me was Alpengeist, which caused me to hit my head against the shoulder restraints. Still pretty fun though, just a precaution. If you're looking for more of a high-thrill ride, Griffin is definitely the go-to roller coaster. But in my opinion the best ride there was Verbolten, although it's not as intense as some of the other coasters, me and my friends had the most fun on it! Definitely get the Quick Queue unlimited pass, we went on a lot of rides many times because we didn't have to wait in a long line. The website says they're $50, but when we went to one of the guest services stands, we only paid around $30 for them. They work for almost every ride except for Tempesto, and Loch Ness Monster. I hope that helps!"

rollercoasters,3cswgk,HRTS5X,13,Fri Jul 10 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"What astounds me is that this costs more than Boulder Dash. Possibly the best wooden coaster in the world, custom made to the landscape, costs less than a compact steel clone. I'd assume that CCI gave them a discount to build their portfolio like they did for Megafobia but jeez did they do value for money apparently. Probably the biggest loss of a coaster company."
rollercoasters,3cswgk,nukii,9,Fri Jul 10 15:00:03 2015 UTC,It likely has to do with inflation over the last 15 years.  But also steel structures are expensive.  $6m today is equivalent to $4.3m in 2000.  $6m in 2000 is equivalent to $8.4m today.
rollercoasters,3cswgk,JamminJay1986,6,Fri Jul 10 15:27:09 2015 UTC,CCI was pretty well known for being super cheap in all aspects of their company. It's why they went out of business.

I took a road trip up to Carowinds earlier this summer and I'll tell you, if I hadn't ridden Goliath at SFoG the day before, I might have noped out myself! Instead, I'm just unimpressed with what my local parks have to offer and am dying to get back on the road. More airtime, please!"

Also take a look on Fbook...  https://www.facebook.com/LakeCompounce  BRISTOL -- Lake Compounce plans Friday to announce ""the single largest investment"" the nation's oldest amusement park has ever made.  It appears almost certain that it intends to erect a new roller coaster that will be ready for the 2016 summer season.  On its Facebook page, the park said today that its last roller coaster -- the acclaimed wooden Boulder Dash built into the side of hill -- was erected 15 years ago.  ""Are we FINALLY adding a new coaster?"" the park asked. ""Any guesses about what kind?""  Roller coaster fans around the country are taking the question as an admission the park plans a major new coaster.  ""We are excited to see what kind of roller coaster this is!"" said the American Coaster Enthusiasts in a Facebook post.  The New England chapter of the national coaster group called the park's declaration Thursday ""practically an admission that it's a roller coaster.""  ""What kind will it be, and where will it be located?"" the group asked.  The park plans to announce details about the new addition at 11 a.m. Friday.  It has two coasters in addition to Boulder Dash now, the 1927 Wildcat and Zoomerang, a metal one installed more than a decade ago.  Steve Collins can be reached at (860) 584-0501, ext. 1801, or at"

rollercoasters,3coc5g,CombustibleLemonz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:05:16 2015 UTC,I found it a bit tougher and the drop track is gimmicky. I think it would have been better if Premier had built it.
rollercoasters,3coc5g,aerikson,5,Thu Jul 16 12:47:07 2015 UTC,The plot of land is too small and landlocked for a coaster (in my mind). How about a new thrilling flat? Giant top spin or (even better) a Skyhawk size S&S swing!
rollercoasters,3coc5g,jpezzznuts,5,Thu Jul 9 14:34:30 2015 UTC,It's a small footprint sure but there is PLENTY more room in the woods behind the coaster and I suspect that's where any new major coaster investment goes. I do think a dark ride investment is coming soon also to KD - and perhaps before the new install on Shockwave's grave - but that will likely go in the action theater location (formerly Days of Thunder and SpongeBob 3D). I still have hopes for an RMC original on the land where shockwave stood with mineshaft tunnels and tree lined inversions.
rollercoasters,3coc5g,Kmac09,3,Thu Jul 9 21:23:02 2015 UTC,That would be an amazing space for a larger El Loco...  I mean if they could build the 4 wide cars like in Australia it would be reasonably capable capacity wise too.

rollercoasters,3cp074,ScottyGefell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:20 2015 UTC,I would like to see what you think now after they stopped dueling. IMHO I think that ice dragon is very forceless and has been hurt the most since they stopped.
rollercoasters,3cp074,AbsolutelyClam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I dont remember liking the Ice Dragon much even dueling.  I need to get back there anyhow for the Harry Potter world soon.
rollercoasters,3cp074,spdivr1122,4,Mon Jul 20 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"My ranking if we're including Vekoma/Intamin inverts as well as B&M looks a little like this:  Afterburn (Carowinds)  Montu  Raptor  Silver Bullet  Alpengeist  Dueling Dragons Red  Batman (SFMM)  Great Bear  Dueling Dragons Blue  Volcano  Mind Eraser (Darien Lake)/Hangman  Afterburn is just solid as hell, everything happens so quickly and the little trenches between elements are phenomenal and add to the speed. It's also probably the most forceful and sharpest transitioning Invert I've ridden.   Honestly the 5 after Afterburn are practically tied. Montu's sequence leading from the loop to the batwing is probably the most intense on any invert I've ridden. Raptor is just fast the whole way and it's flat spins are second to none. Silver Bullet has the floaty invert Stengel dive that leads into the cobra roll and has its fun Helix and Alpengeist is just fast as hell and has a good setting. Then dueling dragons red has the Immelmann into the helix around it which is just insane.   Then there's Batman which happens nearly as fast as Afterburn but is too short, and Great Bear which has sweeping transitions taking some of the excitement away, and too short for its own good. Dueling Dragons Blue is cool but lacks a lot of the fun forceful elements of red.   Volcano is fun from the first launch to the top of the volcano but the rest of the ride falls flat cause it's just zero g rolls. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   And Hangman/Mind Eraser are hang n bangs. Nothing can really make them better but the layout isn't awful. I guess we'll see as it comes if the vest harness helps T3 at all."
rollercoasters,3cp074,X7123M3-256,2,Thu Jul 9 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough I liked ice on dueling dragons way better than fire as well.   Also,  alpengeist. Damn I miss that ride. Last time I went on it was the finale of their fireworks show on the fourth of July a few years back. Was pretty damn cool"

rollercoasters,3cp074,The_DILinator,2,Thu Jul 9 19:18:15 2015 UTC,I've been on some of the best inverts but Silver Bullet is just really unique. Strong forces and great moments of Zero-Gs. The Overbanked turn is the greatest.
rollercoasters,3cp074,Xarith0,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"Silver Bullet is one of the more underrated coasters out there, as I just rarely hear anybody talk about it.  I really like it, however!"
rollercoasters,3cp074,exp09,2,Fri Jul 10 06:16:48 2015 UTC,"My favourite would be Black Mamba, it's the only B&M invert I've ridden so far. Other inverts I have ridden are all just basic vekoma SLC's which are, well, not so pleasant."

rollercoasters,3cp074,talmo91,2,Fri Jul 10 05:59:25 2015 UTC,"Ahh, the Invert!  A coaster style I've always really enjoyed, but tend to take for granted too often...  My ranking will include Volcano, but not the Vekoma SLCs, because they would all congregate on the bottom anyway, and are pretty much the same.  Also, no Arrow Suspended coasters, because I feel they are really an entirely different ride experience...   So, B&M and Volcano rankings are as follows!   Banshee (Kings Island) -  Not really a surprise that the newest is the best! Such a great coaster!  I haven't even ridden it at night yet!  I imagine it'll only rise further after that acclaimed experience! Volcano: The Blast Coaster (Kings Dominion) - My favorite KD coaster when I last went there - though that was 13 years ago now!  Maybe it would drop in my ranks were I to ride it again with more experience... Montu (Busch Gardens Tampa) - Everybody knows this is one of the best Inverts, yet it STILL seems underrated!  Such a great coaster, start to finish! Alpengeist (Busch Gardens Williamsburg) - I know some feel like it's tame, or too drawn out.  But I prefer my Inverts to go somewhere, and do more than just flip around constantly.  Until Banshee, no coaster did it as well as Alpie! Dueling Dragons (Islands of Adventure) - I haven't been on them since there Harry Potter re-theme, so my ranking of them refers to when they were dueling only. Silver Bullet (Knott's Berry Farm) - VERY underrated Invert! Afterburn (Carowinds) - Very good Invert, but I don't think as much of it as most people, it seems...  That part right after the flyover the jet plaza hurt - bad - and really ruined it for me. Great Bear (Hersheypark) - I'm glad to see some love for this coaster here, because I loved it, and almost hear people mention it among the best Inverts!  Again, I like that it goes somewhere, and has a nice setting... Raptor (Cedar Point) - Now we get into the compact Inverts that it seems most enthusiasts love.  Of these more intense models, Raptor leads the way.  Still a great ride, these many years later! Batman - The Ride (Various SF Parks) I've been on four models, and while I could try to remember the variations, to break them down further, for simplicity's sake I'll just rank them all here.  Fun coasters all, but the intensity detracts from the overall ride experience, for my personal taste at least..."
rollercoasters,3cp074,Sage_Rosemary_Thyme,2,Fri Jul 10 06:39:38 2015 UTC,Nemesis @ Alton Towers. The theming and how close it hugs the ground makes it one of the best in the world IMHO.

rollercoasters,3cp074,nannerdw,2,Fri Jul 10 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"This may not be a super popular opinion but I would put the original Batman The Ride at SFGAm high up on my list when you ride in the front row. Yes the back rows have gotten pretty rough, but the front is still relatively smooth and the layout is so tight and forceful and fun. That ride never fails to spike my adrenaline. I honestly always have a good time riding it, even though there have been many inverts that have surpassed it. When they built Batman it was basically a prototype - they had no idea how it was going to run and how intense it was going to be, it was basically a giant educated guess. IIRC the wingovers used to be even smaller and they had to rework some of the track to make it less intense.   I also LOVE Great Bear. It's such a bizarre and unique ride and the setting is so gorgeous, intertwining in that area of the park with the other coasters. It's a travesty it's so short, but it's a fun layout and there's nothing else like it.  And my third favorite would have to be Montu for the reasons listed already.   I have yet to ride Alpengeist but I think that may be one of my favorites some day as well. I was not a fan of Banshee as I've said before on this sub. Not a fan of Raptor. Patriot at Worlds of Fun is a good ride and very solid but not particularly forceful. Dragon Challenge is good. When it comes to manufacturers other than B&M, I enjoy some of the Intamin launced rides, I enjoy the giant inverted boomerangs, and a couple others. HATE the hang and bang mind-eraser clones, etc."

I've ridden:  -Great Bear @ Hershey  -Dragon Challenge (both) @ Universal FL  -Batman @ SF Great Adventure  Think that's it.  Great Bear is what got me into big coasters so it holds a special place for me. Damn I love that Immelmann.  Dragon Challenge is fantastic, I loved both. I think I liked fire a bit more.  Batman is my least favorite of these. A decent bit of headbang and just not as much enjoyment.  Overall, my fave is probably Great Bear. I love it too much. Objectively the best is probably Dragon Challenge Fire though."

They seem to live or die on you being in the front seat, and they're less about airtime and more about inversions which I mostly don't find interesting. Batman is really forceful and fast-paced though and I like that. Afterburn has some tunnels that are neat and a strong batwing. Volcano's launches are amazing and IMO it's the best ride at KD."

Definitely hit up the front row at least once.  Wildcat has been re-tracked partially in recent years if I'm not mistaken... It's a rough little bugger, but fun. Worth a ride as it's one of the oldest coasters in America.  Zoomerang is probably THE SMOOTHEST Boomerang coaster you will ever ride. It used to be a fantastic green color. Not anymore.

rollercoasters,3ck94r,themcgician,6,Wed Jul 8 19:01:05 2015 UTC,The Sahara Hotel was sold where Speed stood. I got to ride it once and it was definitely the best coaster in town (there wasn't many). Now the casino is the SLS which is supposed to be a more upscale place.
rollercoasters,3ck94r,NickCannonsHilarious,4,Wed Jul 8 19:25:40 2015 UTC,The Sahara Casino where the ride was located closed and the ride removed as owners did not want it.

rollercoasters,3ck94r,JohnnyUpsidedown,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:27:38 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it doesn't look like Akita Plaza will ever open. It was originally scheduled to open in 2014 but construction stopped sometime in 2012 or 2013. It's a shame that a roller coaster like that just has to sit out in a field. One of the other resorts on the strip should buy it.
rollercoasters,3ck94r,provoaggie,2,Wed Jul 8 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"Thought so, figured the project was dead.   Wish a 6Flags park would pick it up call it another Mr Freeze ride. I would imagine that the plaza got the ride for the cost of removal and now want a ton of money for it. Kind of surprised a China park has not gotten it.  Maybe the owners of the ride still are thinking of doing something with it."

It hasn't built one since 1993 and the only other steel coaster in the park, the Dragon, is THE WORST ROLLER COASTER IN THE WORLD.  Needless to say.  Pumped!"
rollercoasters,3ck7tu,bbisgard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yah I was visiting Iowa, and even after that one super rough woodie, dragon really disapointed me. It wasn't even that painful, it was just a lame ass ride."
rollercoasters,3ck7tu,yotecayote,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"Which woodie, the Outlaw or the Tornado?  I don't think either of them are too rough; the Outlaw is meant to be rough.  The Dragon shouldn't even be considered a steel coaster.  Its bumpier than any woodie in the park."
rollercoasters,3ck7tu,bbisgard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"Idk I was fine on the dragon just bored to death, the one that was painful for me was the bigger of the two that was all hills, I remember enjoying the more twisty one. Idk it was before I was into coasters and I didn't know what to expect going in so I had no bias, maybe that is why I enjoyed the dragon more because in most people who don't know much about coaster's heads, steel = smooth, and wood = rough.  Edit: Just went on the website, saw some pictures, and remembered more. The Tornado was a bit painful for me and beat me up at the bottom of the hills, but I think I had an overall good time. I remember really liking the outlaw though. But my home park HAD Gwazi, which is much rougher than any of the rides there, and I still had fun on Gwazi, so I was fine on the rides there."
rollercoasters,3ck7tu,yotecayote,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:01:30 2015 UTC,When I was 13 I rode the Tornado 46 times in one day with friends.  No one was at the park and the conductor wouldn't make us get out of the car unless there were enough people for a full load in line.

rollercoasters,3ck7tu,crysco,2,Wed Jul 8 23:03:37 2015 UTC,Some will use it when making bids to parks for a project but it's more of a rough idea than what the ride will actually look like/ do.  They normally will have there own software that's better for calculations/ design and is more accurate than No Limits and then the park itself may have it's own rendering software for advertising. (See any Cedar Fair promo video since 2005ish)
rollercoasters,3ck7tu,gigasteelbyter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:34:00 2015 UTC,To be fair most companies simulations look considerably better than this. Would rather a small park skimp on the simulation and blow the budget on the actual ride personally
rollercoasters,3ck7tu,foknboxcutta,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:25:33 2015 UTC,Looks like there are going to be some gnarly negative-Gs on that rollercoaster. Especially through that 3rd(2nd?) inversion.
rollercoasters,3cl91w,CarterGee,11,Wed Jul 8 19:57:49 2015 UTC,"Good god DON'T do Twisted Colossus first! I live 3 minutes away and go to the park 3 or 4 times a week, sometimes more. I have a gold pass and get the 10 minute early entry and still even if I head straight to Twisted Colossus I'll always be passed by everyone running and by the time I get there it'll be at 20 to 30 minutes of a wait. By the time people with regular tickets get there it can be upwards of an hour, even if it's the first ride you head to when the gates open.  Park opening is a magical time when virtually all the lines are short. If you are careful, you can ride as much in the first hour and a half as you will in the next 8 hours. The key is staying one coaster ahead of the crowd. When those gates open everyone is going to head for Twisted Colossus, Full Throttle, and X2 in that order.   If you have a regular ticket (not a gold pass) you'll need to either be at the park 45 minutes to an hour before gates open OR be there about 10 minutes before the gates open and be vigilant. What you'll see is a huge line for all the turnstiles at the gate and on the right side a short line for the gold pass owners. When the park opens the gold pass line will be converted to a standard line. So, instead of waiting in a long line, wait out in front of the gold pass line. As soon as it becomes standard jump in and you'll get in the park as fast as the people who got there an hour early.  Now that you're in the park, you have to stay ahead of the crowd. Forget Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus for now and head for X2. No time to dilly dally, keep up a faced paced walk. You'll be amazed at how short the line is! Give it one ride and head out. If for any reason it looks like it's not running, immediately abandon it. You may feel like it's worth the wait and ""but the line is sooooo short"" but don't let those feelings get to you, just bail. If you do get a ride on it you're going to love it and want to do it again because the line is soooo short. DON'T. If you do this, you'll miss out on the lineless bliss that will only last for a short time.  Now head straight to Tatsu. Skip by Viper, skip by Revolution. Those rides will have 5 minute waits come 4pm. Tatsu is going to blow your mind and you'll be amazed how short the line is and you'll want to ride it again. DON'T. Stay ahead of the crowd.   Now head straight for Superman. It's just up the hill around the Tatsu entrance. Skip by Ninja and head to Superman. Ride it, don't reride. You're probably getting the idea now.   Now you have some choices. There may be a couple people at the hill by now but you're further into the park than the vast majority of people. My recommendation would be to hit Ninja since it's so close, then head down to Apocalypse, and then Riddler. You should be able to do all these by noon. Once noon hits the park will be saturated and you can do your own thing.  As for riding Twisted Colossus I HIGHLY recommend using the single rider line. It's about 5 minutes and then you're on. You even have about a 25% chance of being sat with your friend. That is, a lot of times there is a whole row open and two single riders are put in it.   Goliath may also be open by the time you go and the line is generally shorter in the early afternoon than it is later. Make sure you also do the Drop of Doom as well which has a single rider line and can save you big time. The other rides with single rider lines are Green Lantern's First Flight, The Riddler's Revenge, Viper, and Revolution. The single rider line on Riddler is amazing and you're pretty much guaranteed to be on the same train as your friends with a high probability you'll be able to sit next to them too.  Splitting a pizza is probably the best value for food there and you can do that at the Waterfront or in DC Universe."
rollercoasters,3cl91w,Xope_Poquar,2,Thu Jul 9 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"Um. Okay. So. You're getting gold. Seriously you're insanely helpful. I'm going on my birthday so I can absolutely drag my friends wherever I want ;)  One small thing, I have a Gold Flash Pass. Does that change anything?"
rollercoasters,3cl91w,Xope_Poquar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"Woohoo! Thank you, I'm glad to help! The Gold Flash Pass will definitely help in the afternoon, especially if you go on a weekend. I'd stick to the plan at least until noon and then go nuts with the flash pass as best you can.  Just make sure you're in the gate as close to opening as possible. If you don't get in the park until say 7 minutes after gates open I'd skip X2 and go straight to Tatsu. Come back with the flash pass later. If you're 20 to 30 minutes late just head straight to the back and hit Apocalypse, Riddler, Green Lantern, and Batman.   Stay hydrated. Every food vendor is required to give you filtered, chilled water on request (much better than drinking fountains). If you can avoid bringing any bag that won't fit in your pocket do it. Bring ziplock bags to put keys/cell phones in if you plan on doing water rides.  Oh, and check out the show at the GearWorks Theater. It's surprisingly good and not something people usually consider doing on a roller coaster trip. Have a fun trip!"

rollercoasters,3ck5nv,sneakyfrankie,11,Wed Jul 8 15:24:17 2015 UTC,I like the B&M variants - Vekoma rarely wins in head-to-head manufacturing comparisons. That being said Tatsu blows them all out of the water.
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,jpezzznuts,4,Wed Jul 8 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"The actual layout of the Vekomas are better, but they ride so terribly it doesn't matter.    ""Boring"" B&M over ""interesting"" Vekoma every day of the week."
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,JamminJay1986,3,Wed Jul 8 16:23:08 2015 UTC,I'm going to be the odd one here.  I really don't like the pretzel loops as high g-forces on my back are just uncomfortable to me.  I also really dig the roll over on the Vekomas.  That moment is easily one of the most hair raising because you are suddenly supported by the restraints.
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,Kmac09,3,Wed Jul 8 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"The B&M Superman rides are my least favorite flyers. So. Boring. The Vekoma ones feel totally out of control and that makes them more fun in my opinion. Overall though, B&M makes better flyers (Manta!), but if we're just comparing the Superman clones to Vekoma, I'd rather ride Vekoma - and I don't normally wan to ride anything by Vekoma."
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,CarterGee,2,Wed Jul 8 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Flying Dutchmen any day of the week over the B&M Flyers.  The Superman clones are rather boring, and its awkward to sit in the brake run for so long due to poor operations.    I will say that Manta is my favorite flyer, but if I had one of each next to each other, I'd pick the Vekoma.  I'd really like to try their Stingray model, they look fun and have a quicker load/unload because of the redesigned harnesses.  But I'd really like to try Starry Sky Ripper, it's unlike any other B&M flyer."
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,Woirol,2,Wed Jul 8 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"Superman any day of the week. The ride is smoother, the restraints are significantly more comfortable, and the load/unload times are way better on the B&M fliers than Flying Dutchmen.   Firehawk is the only roller coaster that's ever made me throw up while on the ride, so that's a strike against it in my book, no matter how petty that may be :p"
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,exp09,2,Wed Jul 8 22:14:29 2015 UTC,"I think the Vekoma clones layout is better than the B&M superman layout.  B&M needs to do more lie-to-fly, fly-to-lie elements and while i love the pretzel loops, add the regular loops too.  Both rock.  However, I do like the B&M restraints more."
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,ScottyGefell,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:40:56 2015 UTC,"The specialty element that flying coasters are really good for is the inside-out loop. What I've noticed is that the B&Ms pretty much chuck you straight into that element at the beginning of the ride, while it still has a ton of energy, while the Vekomas kind of wait for it."
rollercoasters,3ck5nv,vinciblechunk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"Only one I have ridden is a superman clone. Other than the loop right at the start which was cool, it was boring.

rollercoasters,3ck5nv,BCawth06,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer the Vekoma clone flyers. That moment of flipping upside down at the top of the lift is really rather impressive.

Even the more ""boring"" Superman clones for B&M are a better ride experience in my opinion, than any of the Vekomas!  And Tatsu and Manta?  Both in my top 25 coasters (out of over 200)!  Excellent coasters!    Having said that, I still find I enjoy the Vekoma Flyers more than most of my friends, both enthusiast and non.

rollercoasters,3chfwg,tideblue,2,Tue Jul 7 23:36:05 2015 UTC,Yes! Watching this I just kept thinking about the thread a couple weeks back about recording on rides. This is a perfect example of why so many folks gave a hell no to that idea.

rollercoasters,3chfwg,cYzzie,22,Tue Jul 7 23:12:08 2015 UTC,Actually most parks already have a ban on any kind of recording device.. Be it strapped down or not. A lot of places will remove you from the park/revoke season passes/ban from other parks owned by the company if you are caught. Even media outlets are very rarely allowed to bring recording devices on media days. Most parks will provide you with park shot footage.. And will even set up a camera that has been tested and certified to film The reaction of riders (aka the media riding.)  As someone who has personally been hit with a camera on a roller coaster. It pisses me off to no end seeing people try to sneak crap on. That is why I do.. And will always report anyone I see doing it.

rollercoasters,3chfwg,johnnyhala,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"Local here too. I have friends that work for the park and they've heard talks behind the scenes. I also asked a couple workers last time I was there and they both said 'they're working on it.'  Taken with a grain of salt, but I'm optimistic."
rollercoasters,3chfwg,bejaydoubleyou,6,Sun Jul 12 17:28:57 2015 UTC,The GoPro couldn't stand riding Tempesto.
rollercoasters,3chfwg,studiopzp,4,Tue Jul 7 23:02:20 2015 UTC,I just rode this three hours ago. I don't know why they let this person on. This shouldn't happen.
rollercoasters,3chfwg,yaminub,2,Tue Jul 7 23:55:07 2015 UTC,It's very strange they let him on Tempesto like that. They are incredibly strict about things being in zipper pockets or phanny packs.
rollercoasters,3cib4i,jutop42,11,Wed Jul 8 03:14:06 2015 UTC,"Have ridden both.  I think the major difference is the restraints. TTD is the clear winner by only having the lap bar. But there's a lot else I like about it. TTD has better placement in the park - you cannot ignore it as people shoot past you down the length of the midway. There's also TTD's grandstand, where people by the dozens really do sit and watch. And the theming is both over-the-top and completely appropriate to a ride that's about acceleration.  Kingda Ka, meanwhile, has an entrance at the edge of the park (which is a little hard to get to; they should connect Golden Kingdom with Plaza del Carnival), and it shoots you way out into the woods where nobody will see you. It's named after a tiger which isn't on exhibit anymore, and the ride is completely wrapped in ads for göt2b glued. ""Take your style to new heights!"" No thanks, I'm not going for the Jersey look.  The thing Kingda Ka really has going for it is Zumanjaro, which is great, although you have to walk the entire length of Kingda Ka to get to it and there's zero else in that corner of the park."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,vinciblechunk,9,Wed Jul 8 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"I've only been on Kingda Ka, but from what I've heard, TTD is better. People say that while Kingda Ka gives you some good airtime on the hump, they say TTD is smoother and has better restraints."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,vinbel121,4,Wed Jul 8 03:16:38 2015 UTC,I thought kk 's restrains were quite comfortable. I love that ride. I will admit it's more rough than my liking towards the back of the train though.   I'm biased though. I haven't had the pleasure of going to cedar point :/
rollercoasters,3cib4i,spdivr1122,2,Wed Jul 8 05:12:32 2015 UTC,Same here. 1: I don't think KK's restraints restraints are too bad. 2: Haven't been to Cedar Point.
rollercoasters,3cib4i,vinbel121,3,Wed Jul 8 09:24:03 2015 UTC,I'd actually say they're pretty comfortable. I like those restraints.
rollercoasters,3cib4i,spdivr1122,2,Wed Jul 8 14:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they aren't too bad. I'd just perferblap bars. Tbh. I just rode it and it's not as bad as I remember."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,vinbel121,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:04 2015 UTC,Does Kingda Ka have OTSRs like i305? Or are they like Mavericks old restraints?
rollercoasters,3cib4i,vinbel121,7,Wed Jul 8 03:17:48 2015 UTC,Maverick's old restraints :(
rollercoasters,3cib4i,KaiserCoaster,4,Wed Jul 8 03:23:41 2015 UTC,Ew I hate those things . Definitely prefer TTDs lap bars to those
rollercoasters,3cib4i,nannerdw,3,Wed Jul 8 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"Which are also i305's old restraints! In fact, we're pretty sure Kingda Ka got the exact restraints that i305 got rid of. Right around the time i305 switched, red licorice colored restraints started appearing on Ka. (They were orange)"
rollercoasters,3cib4i,phantomtails,7,Thu Jul 9 04:09:58 2015 UTC,"TTD.  My ride on Ka was basically the equivalent of sitting on a chair made of jackhammers for 20 seconds.  In fact, the jackhammers probably would have been more tolerable.  Those horrible bacon strip OTSRs sure didn't help either."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,CarterGee,4,Wed Jul 8 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"Seconded. I love Dragster and wanted to love KK as well, but it's rough as hell. It's not the restraints (though you can get a good whack on the head/neck if you aren't braced for the drop), but rather simply a matter of the car violently shaking the entire time. There are several coasters at Great Adventure that seem to suffer from this problem so I imagine it's a maintenance issue."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,MrBrightside711,3,Wed Jul 8 04:49:27 2015 UTC,Haha dramatic....
rollercoasters,3cib4i,Psirocking,11,Wed Jul 8 16:56:10 2015 UTC,You are begging for the CP fanboys to rip this thread up
rollercoasters,3cib4i,ScottyGefell,2,Wed Jul 8 03:15:31 2015 UTC,Sorry I didn't mean too. I wanted honest opinions
rollercoasters,3cib4i,The_DILinator,2,Wed Jul 8 03:16:36 2015 UTC,I may be in the minority too but I prefer KK.  I feel like TTDs theming is lazy and unoriginal and KKs location in the park is nicer.
rollercoasters,3cib4i,Ruboswhy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"I've been on both many times living in both Ohio and NYC.  Kingda Ka wins on the launch, its actually seems much more intense to me than Top Thrill.  Kingda Ka wins on height but you really dont notice the difference.  Top Thrill wins on theme, I love the drag race light tree and how the tower lights up with the tree at night too.  And the stadium seating is a nice addition.  Top Thrill murders on location.  Views of Lake Erie vs Jersey win by a landslide.  Top Thrill wins on smoothness.  I have no idea why...but Kindga Ka is rough.  Top Thrill wins on restraints.  The freedom of the lap bar adds another level of thrill.  Top Thrill wins on capacity.  The line moves faster on Top Thrill and now Kingda Ka has to wait for Zumanjaro to finish in between launches making lines even longer.  **Side note Zumanjaro is the BEST drop tower I have ever been on!  Cedar Point really should invest in one and demo Power Tower.  I lost my breath TWICE on that fall."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,The_DILinator,3,Thu Jul 9 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely in the minority here, but I prefered Kingda Ka, despite having been on TTD many more times.  It's faster, higher (though that isn't really noticeable), and I preferred the airtime hill to the brake run.  I also think it's a LOT better looking, as Green/Blue are soothing colors, and Yellow/Red are garish, and obnoxious colors.  But I digress..."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,notmuchgoingontoday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:01:49 2015 UTC,I don't know if soothing is the main priority at 120 mph...

rollercoasters,3cib4i,exp09,2,Mon Jul 13 06:51:01 2015 UTC,"i rode ka before i got to ride ttd and prefer ttd. i wasn't able to tell the difference in height and i don't remember which launch was more intense, but to me personally not having OTSRs really made a huge difference. it's much more exciting without them imo. and the airtime hill on ka is totally useless. i also like the whole dragster theme/setup with spectator area etc. it's fun to just sit down for a bit, grab a camera, practice panning shots and just watch the expression on people's faces."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,XmertonX,3,Wed Jul 8 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"Guys. They're like.... the same. Let's cool it with ""Kingda Ka is LITERALLY the roughest ever and broke me in half!"" and ""TTD is the smoothest greatest thing everrrrrr!""  I've been on both. I enjoy Kingda Ka better because of the colors and because I know it's taller (even if I can't tell when I ride it)."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,jwilphl,2,Wed Jul 8 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"Also the brakes are so much better coming down that second hill than on TTD, if only for the fact that it doesn't feel as sudden."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,KingdaToro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"The difference in height and speed is negligible and since it is not possible to ride them side by side, it is unnoticeable. Many people will complain about the restraints on Kingda Ka and I usually hate any ride with over the shoulder restraints due to head banging but I don't think the restraints make much of a difference on rides like these which have very little lateral movement.  The airtime hill at the end on KK is a nice addition but loses some impact by hitting the breaks right after cresting the hill.  The only significant difference is that Kingda Ka is ruined by violent, brain rattling shaking.  I absolutely love the feeling of the sustained acceleration that both rides provide but I could ride TTD over and over again and for Kingda Ka it's one and I'm done."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,JamminJay1986,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:20:27 2015 UTC,"Most opinions seem to favor TTD largely because no OTSR (over the shoulder restraints).  The stats are pretty similar and you won't notice a big difference between them in terms of overall operation.  I think I still prefer KK overall; the acceleration feels a bit more intense to me, but I haven't actually measured on both to confirm that.  It could simply be psychological.  TTD is a bit smoother presently, but I did get to ride KK the year it opened and it was just fine then.  I don't think these rides tend to age very well, especially with limited maintenance.  In the end, if you've been on one, you've more or less been on both."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,The_DILinator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"Hooray I can finally contribute to this discussion!  Having finally ridden Kingda Ka back in June, I can easily say Dragster is better.  And it's not even close.  Most reasons I think people have stated, but Kingda Ka is so so so rough, especially for how relatively new it is.  Maybe it was the seat I was in, but both the pull in and pull out were worse than SoB's rose bowls in terms roughness.  On top of that, the twists both up and down slammed my neck into the restraints, which isn't a problem on Dragster.    Add to that, the fact that there is no real noticeable difference in the extra 36 feet in height and 8 mph in speed and the launch didn't seem as powerful and the extra hill had maybe mild floater at best and didn't add to the ride and Kingda Ka falls well short of Dragster.  Kingda Ka does have Zumanjaro strapped to it though, which is better than Ka itself."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,BCawth06,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:43:48 2015 UTC,"TTD is smoother, but the biggest difference between them (and one that nobody seems to mention) is that TTD doesn't have trim brakes on top of the tower like Ka does. Those brakes totally ruin the drop in anything but the first two rows, while TTD's back row has AMAZING air going down the drop."
rollercoasters,3cib4i,JamminJay1986,-2,Sun Jul 12 02:25:24 2015 UTC,They both suck.   Didn't want to disappoint you /u/RealNotFake

rollercoasters,3chbnq,CurbYourNewUrbanism,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:18:55 2015 UTC,I have never felt anything like that launch since they demoed it. She truly was a monster.
rollercoasters,3chbnq,_ARCHANG31_,11,Thu Jul 9 18:24:39 2015 UTC,Dodonpa. That launch has to be getting up into aircraft carrier catapult territory.
rollercoasters,3chbnq,Firree,7,Tue Jul 7 22:59:33 2015 UTC,The acceleration is faster than the most recent U.S. aircraft carrier launch system.
rollercoasters,3chbnq,PagaroDog,2,Wed Jul 8 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"Dodonpa's accelerates from 0 mph to its maximum speed, 172 km/h, in 1.8 seconds, giving it an acceleration of 26.6 m/s2 (87.2 ft/sec2), and up to 2.7 G's.[10][11] By comparison, astronauts only experience 3 G's at liftoff, though for a substantially longer time than 1.8 seconds"
rollercoasters,3chbnq,bonsaiisuperstar,9,Wed Jul 8 23:53:10 2015 UTC,"Not the most powerful, but the second launch on Maverick is so awesome."
rollercoasters,3chbnq,kbups53,6,Wed Jul 8 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe not a very common answer, but Flight of Fear at Kings Island is pretty awesome. The dark, indoor lighting and loud roar of the track combined with the usual comedic ""3...2...launch"" from the ride operator makes for a very thrilling start.  Honorary mention: Wicked Twister at Cedar Point. There's just something about the screeching of the launch that sounds like screams from the riders. Took me forever to figure out that it wasn't the people on the ride screaming. You'd know exactly what I'm talking about if you've ever ridden."
rollercoasters,3chbnq,savingprivatebrian15,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:20:05 2015 UTC,I was thinking the very same thing. The launch and initial cobra roll on FoF remains one of my favorites.  I'd give the HM to Full Throttle. That's one intimidating loop on the other side of that launch :)

rollercoasters,3chbnq,vinciblechunk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:23:59 2015 UTC,Will agree on this one since my answer was for Hypersonic which is no longer around. The Volcano launch into the wide turn and back into the LIMs is sick.

Kingda Ka is definitely the most intense launch I've had. It's just a monstrous acceleration rate.  The Old Batman/Robin Chiller rides at SFGAdv... I've only ever been on the Robin side before they tore it down.... but it was FUN. The restraints were very uncomfortable, and I felt very cramped.... but it was a pretty darn fun launch.  And Lastly... Hulk... It's ""launch"" is very different, but the whole ""story"" of the ride is quite nice. Plus, immediate barrel roll after the launch? Hell yeah."

I'll got with Formula Rossa which has a long launch section which gets increasingly faster beyond the speeds that TTD and Kingda achieve."
rollercoasters,3chlej,CombustibleLemonz,6,Tue Jul 7 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"They certainly have the space to expand but it doesn't seem to be a ""necessity"" for them to have a major steel investment. Since i305 they have had the generic Windseeker, expansion of Planet Snoopy, 40 year anniversary celebration that spanned nearly two seasons, and expansion of water park. I think that they are ready for a thrill investment but the recent comments regarding cedar fair dark rides makes me think that is next. If RMC gets in on Cedar Fair I would love a Virginia countryside wood runner that chases behind the grove that is behind Shockwave.   Edit: New entrance does fit with the model but KD was looking good from the front and has Dominator out for all to see. I don't feel that upon entering its underwhelming as KD has the beautiful fountains and Eiffel Tower welcoming you. They have seemed to avoid putting many rides near the entrance also. Bezerker and Scambler were the only two for decades with now only Bezerker and Dominator being right as you come in."

Plus, as an added kick to the store, my brother lost his keys on the ride - and he drove us!  Luckily, a worker was easily able to retrieve them for us (though he did it while the ride was still going - a questionable move), so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  Still...  Just say ""No"" to that mess!"
rollercoasters,3cfzhc,delanto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:15:21 2015 UTC,It isn't the most comfortable but that doesn't destroy all enjoyment for me; it's actually pretty funny spinning uncontrollably in the second half of the ride. Especially when you come into the station completely upside down.

I think it does have a good collection of coasters for working kids up to big coasters, if that's something a family needs.  As somebody who loves thrilling coasters, I found it VERY lacking in that department, outside of the obvious names.  I also know that my kids are all at the point where they will ride the really big coasters (even my 8 and 6 year old), so while they would appreciate the park more than I do, I don't think this ""build up"" would apply to them.  Still, I must confess that I have probably been too harsh and dismissive of the park, previously, as it has plenty of nice attributes as well.  It may be my ""home park"" in a few years, so we'll see if I warm up to it more then, and if my youngest (currently 1) enjoys some of the benefit of what this article is referring to!"

rollercoasters,3cdg5k,JamminJay1986,5,Tue Jul 7 11:19:18 2015 UTC,I much prefer a thrilling rollercoaster and the fantasy story of a dark ride does nothing for me. I know that the budget only allows for one at a time and personally I'd take coaster over dark ride any day. Only now with kids does a dark ride appeal to me and not really me but if the kids are happy I'm happy.

rollercoasters,3cdg5k,tideblue,4,Tue Jul 7 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"The wall of the construction sight currently has a countdown feature titled ""A Legacy Of World Class Roller Coasters"", And there are plaques for each CP roller coaster, oldest to newest. So far the countdown is at - Blue Streak->Mine Ride->Corkscrew->Gemini->Wilderness Run->Iron Dragon. They add a new plaque every week. Obviously this indicates that the final plaque to be placed will be the new attraction for next season. It would be pretty nonsensical for CP to use this method of countdown to announce a ride that is NOT a roller coaster. It looks like CP is 100% getting a new coaster next season."

rollercoasters,3cdg5k,Harakou,2,Tue Jul 7 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that ""tease"" was nothing more than a reference to the fact that they'll be growing actual pumpkins in that location for Halloweekends.  I don't believe that had anything to do with next year's addition, or even future additions beyond that.    FWIW, I still believe they'll get a roller coaster (likely a Dive Coaster) next season, and then the interactive Dark Ride the following year.  There is plenty of room cleared out in that entire area for both.  Another option would be putting it where the arcade is currently, which wouldn't surprise me either."
rollercoasters,3cdg5k,The_DILinator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:18:03 2015 UTC,Not sure about growing actual pumpkins but what if that is just a tease for the fact the announcement will come during Halloweekends as it has so many times before. Something will def be growing there soon :)

rollercoasters,3cdg5k,TheQuassitworsh,3,Tue Jul 7 14:43:01 2015 UTC,You have to understand that Cedar Point's butter zone for profit is not from roller coaster enthusiasts who are already going to come to the park and have season passes. Their untapped market and where they can really squeeze extra money out of the system right now is the family market. There really isn't that much to do that is family oriented when you compare it to Disney or even Kings Island.
rollercoasters,3cdg5k,TheQuassitworsh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:47:15 2015 UTC,I understand it's for money and that they'll have a greater appeal to the general public if they cater to families. I'll be fine if they don't put too much focus on being more family-oriented and keep most of the focus on big rides.
rollercoasters,3cdg5k,Imaginos64,4,Tue Jul 7 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's something you have to worry about since it's almost guaranteed at this point that 2016 will bring a new coaster. They've been doing a good job balancing thrill rides and family additions. I mean, last year we got two family rides, this year we got Rougarou, next year we will likely get a coaster, and then I'm guessing 2017 will be the dark ride.  For the record I can't get too excited over this announcement either but Cedar Point needs to make smart business decisions so they can afford to keep building those expensive new coasters we love."

No real structure, there are issues with stylistic consistency (e.g. mentioning dates somewhere, not elsewhere where it would logically make sense to include them), grammar errors... I like what you're going for, but I think there's a ways to go. You say it's rushed; I say don't release it if you already know that. You're not on a deadline, so why put it out if it's not finished? Sloppy content is the sort of thing that makes me as a user not want to bookmark the site or check back for new articles in the future.  A couple other general thoughts on the site/format: I would advocate for removing your (large, prominent) image watermarks entirely, or at least making them WAY smaller and more subtle. You also seem to have disabled basic UX functionality (select text and right click)... this is a huge nono. I understand the point - you want to protect your content. That's fine, but throw a Creative Commons license disclaimer at the bottom of the page, or even a ""Copyright [yournamehere] 2015, All Rights Reserved"" if you really want. Disabling basic UX features and watermarking images just makes your site less fun to browse, and your content less fun to look at, all the while doing literally nothing to stop people from ""stealing"" your content (exhibit A).  I hope this doesn't come across as overly critical.

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,drbeer,7,Mon Jul 6 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"Ohhhhh my gosh. So wrong about that haha. I305 is completely badass and insanely unique for a giga being so close to the ground. I think it's an exceptional ride, one of my favorites."

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,bonsaiisuperstar,5,Mon Jul 6 23:53:07 2015 UTC,El Toro is amazing. Is it really considered that intense?

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Jstbcool,3,Sun Jul 5 23:50:16 2015 UTC,Rode it the week after opening (pre changes). It was overly intense.

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Bricktycoon,5,Sun Jul 5 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"I take it you rode it after they made it better? It used to keep squeezing your thighs on the station brake run... It made the ride almost completely unbearable, especially if someone was holding up the station."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Dear_Watson,4,Mon Jul 6 00:23:21 2015 UTC,I rode it in 2012. I don't know if that was before or after.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Bricktycoon,3,Mon Jul 6 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"That would be before, I believe they fixed it in 2013 or 2014..."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Dear_Watson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:55:57 2015 UTC,...squeezing your thighs?
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,vinbel121,3,Mon Jul 6 01:08:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the lap bar used to crush your thighs while you were waiting on the brake run. Now they have the lap bars release a little on the brake run"
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Dear_Watson,3,Mon Jul 6 01:24:40 2015 UTC,That little release always gives new riders such a good scare.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Travis100,2,Mon Jul 6 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"I heard more audible sighs of relief than anything.  ProTip, the restraints only pop as far as the seat belt allows them to. After a couple rides, I learned to loosen the seat belt a little bit as soon as we hit the brake run."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,vinciblechunk,3,Mon Jul 6 12:12:41 2015 UTC,"Wait, the seatbelt stops the restraints? I'm sure they must be set to stop after a certain distance. If not, wow."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Travis100,2,Mon Jul 6 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know all the mechanical details, but from what I remember:   The restraints pop once, and then re-lock. After that, they won't pop up any farther until you're back in the station, even if you undo the seat belt completely. The seat belt stops the restraints. There may be something else stopping the restraints, but I'm not sure.   This is from memory. I rode it about two weeks ago.  TL;DR if you don't loosen the seat belt, you get cheated out of the pop. But I was able to get quite a bit of slack going by my third or fourth ride. Perhaps a Hershey ride op could explain, if there are any reading this."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,vinciblechunk,3,Mon Jul 6 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"Well the pop is a release of the hydraulic restraints. Since it is a short pop the restraints will stop after it is over, even if your seatbelt is off, I'm guessing. It makes sense."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Travis100,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:56:27 2015 UTC,"Being an Intamin ride, hydraulic restraints would make sense.  (I got to watch ride ops use the battery pack on Maverick once. That was educational.)"
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,vinciblechunk,2,Tue Jul 7 03:41:17 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. I'd assume the force of the ride pushes the lap bars down during the ride? I've been on some coasters that did that.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,vinbel121,2,Mon Jul 6 01:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the design of the lap bar is also pointed so that it drives directly into your bone."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,2,Mon Jul 6 03:37:40 2015 UTC,"Ouch, that sounds painful. Good thing they fixed that."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,vinbel121,2,Mon Jul 6 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they've actually fixed the shape of the restraints - maybe someone who has ridden recently can weigh in on that? I know they have made it so the restraints release early on the brake run to provide relief, but that's not really the same thing. It's just not an ergonomic ride like say, a B&M hyper."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,3,Mon Jul 6 16:23:29 2015 UTC,I've only been on one B&M hyper (Nitro) and I can tell you that it had hands down the most comfortable restraints I have ever felt.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,vinbel121,3,Mon Jul 6 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, you can literally just let yourself go limp in those rides and not feel any pain."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,2,Mon Jul 6 18:58:18 2015 UTC,The restraints are softer from when it first opened.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,disownedpear,3,Mon Jul 6 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"I rode it last summer. I've been on I305 the week it opened and I found Skyrush more painful. I think it would have been nice if the drop was 50 ft shorter (I'd argue this on I305 as well), since the rest of the layout doesn't really need the 200 ft drop."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Krakatoacoo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"I did that ride 30 times in one day last year! Thighs did hurt after that, but I thought it was very enjoyable"

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,3,Mon Jul 6 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"First time I went to Six Flags Over Georgia, before I went, my mom reminiscing on when she went when she was a kid and how Georgia Cyclone was the best thing ever. All I remember from it was how painful it was to ride. :("
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Orangerrific,2,Mon Jul 6 07:04:17 2015 UTC,"This is pretty common. I'm not sure how old you are, but I'm 25...when I rode the Georgia Cyclone was a kid it was hands down the best coaster at the park and from what I remember, right when the Internet happened, early coaster lists had it as one of the top 10 woodies in the world.   I don't remember the year, but there was a gap of a few years between rides for me and I remember getting on it first thing one morning and halfway through the ride was like, ""what the hell is happening? this is awful!""   It got too rough. I've not ridden it since the retrack."

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,windog,9,Mon Jul 6 05:07:08 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoyed that ride a lot when I rode it, but I also thouroghly enjoy the boss at sfstl. So I suppose I'm in the minority of people who enjoy rough wooden rides"
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,themcgician,3,Mon Jul 6 05:45:57 2015 UTC,Hurts my lower back to much. Also it goes to slow on those overbanks. I didn't like it all that much but I always make sure to ride it when I go to CP
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,jutop42,3,Mon Jul 6 07:48:45 2015 UTC,"The Boss is a fun, unique ride though. It's rough but at least it has other things going for it. Mean Streak has no thrills, it's just pain."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,9,Mon Jul 6 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"Mean Streak is a ride that suffers from its own immensity, if you ever get a trimless ride on a day that's not freezing cold it's actually an amazing ride but with how much the trims have to slow the train down to just to keep the ride from tearing itself apart it becomes a big painful piece of shit."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,acu2005,2,Mon Jul 6 07:58:58 2015 UTC,"Last time I rode it was on a crazy hot day in 2000. Was expecting it to be comparable to the Texas Giant, but wasn't nearly as intense or fun."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,windog,4,Mon Jul 6 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"Cheetah Hunt has some of the most painful over-the-shoulder harnesses. They were so bad that I couldn't enjoy the ride. Of course, I'm also around 6'5"" so it could be that I'm just too tall for them to be comfortable."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Ritz527,2,Mon Jul 6 12:09:26 2015 UTC,I'm the same height and I've always found raising my hands on coasters with those Intamin OTSRs kind of cradles the restraints and mitigates any pain on my shoulders/neck area. At least it did on rides like Maverick (before it switched to the softer restraints) and Storm Runner.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,aerikson,2,Mon Jul 6 16:11:13 2015 UTC,Definitely because you're tall. I don't even touch the top of the shoulder bars

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,yotecayote,12,Tue Jul 7 00:42:14 2015 UTC,Millennium force(less). I was expecting for my head to explode after I had ridden it the first time. I was actually really quite disappointed when I got off.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,rollercoasterfanitic,20,Mon Jul 6 00:33:14 2015 UTC,I must be riding incorrectly because the forces on that ride make me grey-out every time.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Obamasmanpurse,13,Mon Jul 6 01:24:52 2015 UTC,Same here. The big turn after the drop through the first tunnel is all fuzzy for me. I love it!
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,robkabob,4,Mon Jul 6 01:51:45 2015 UTC,I actually kinda second this. The first drop and the speed is fun. But I wish it had more airtime.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,SethRader,4,Mon Jul 6 04:58:56 2015 UTC,"I LOVE MF, but I too wish it had more in the way of airtime.  That is definitely its one weakness.  That is also why Fury is now my favorite coaster!  ;)"
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,The_DILinator,3,Mon Jul 6 07:36:30 2015 UTC,I hear that!!
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,jutop42,4,Mon Jul 6 07:39:49 2015 UTC,The only force Millennium Force(less) is missing is airtime. I laugh at the MF fanboys.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Krakatoacoo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"I, myself, often wonder why it's been voted the best roller coaster in the world so many times. I think it's the drop angle and speed really, combined with smooth runs and turns. Every time I get off that thing, my eyes are a watery mess and my hair is crazy, so it must be doing something right."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,savingprivatebrian15,2,Wed Jul 8 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"No, just no!  Calling it Millennium Forceless is like calling the Atlantic Ocean the Atlantic Desert!  lol    My enthusiast friends all like to do this too, and I always give them crap about it (so don't feel picked on!)  You can say it was disappointing, not your thing, didn't like it, yadda yadda...  But to say it's forceless is just flat out incorrect, and unfactual!  ;)"
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,The_DILinator,3,Mon Jul 6 07:35:37 2015 UTC,"Compare it to something like Skyrush or even Magnum at the same park and it is completely forceless. It's a comparison thing - many people who claim it is forceless have been on much better rides that don't get nearly the hype of MF. MF has a beautiful design and gorgeous view from the lift and it really shapes the skyline as you drive up the peninsula, but that's about all it does well."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"No, it is VERY forceful.  Fact.  People don't often struggle with greying out on a ride that is ""completely forceless"" regardless of what other coasters they've been on.  What I think you are missing, is that the rides you mentioned have different kinds of forces - negative g's (hard ejector air) - but that doesn't diminish MF's extremely forceful ride experience.  Like I said, some people clearly prefer those forces to the kind of forces MF delivers, and that's fine. But again, to call MF, Millennium Forceless, is an extreme misnomer.   And for the record, I've been on over 200 coasters, so there is absoluetely no lack of experience when it comes to me.  In spite of that, it is STILL my second favorite coaster.  That doesn't make me wrong, or any less intelligent about coasters.  Coasters are subjective.  What is NOT subjective, however, is that MF is in no way, shape, or form, forceless."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,The_DILinator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:11:25 2015 UTC,"Chill out bro, I never called into question your coaster experience or anything like that. You are welcome to having MF as your #1 coaster for all I care. I know there are plenty of people out there who love it and have it has one of their top coasters. All that said, that doesn't change the fact it's still relatively boring compared to many of the rides that have since surpassed it. There's no way I would ever take MF over Fury 325 if you're talking about pure thrills, however MF might come out on top when you consider the history of the ride and the gorgeous location. MF was revolutionary for its time, but now it rests on its laurels. FYI - Greying out can happen on any ride that has a period of extended positive G's - It has to do with the blood temporarily draining from your head and some people are more sensitive to it than others - it's not an overall mark of intensity."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:45:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I came across as ""unchill"", but I was just calmly discussing facts, and my contention that Millennium Forceless is the ultimate misnomer, propegated by enthusiasts who prefer a certain type of coaster intsensity over the obvious intensity MF offers.  Extended positive G's ARE a mark of intensity, and MF sustains its intensity (though thankfully not that initial burst) the entire ride - a rare feat for a roller coaster.  I agree that Fury is better, which is why it is my new #1 over MF.  I have also ridden The Voyage and El Toro, however, and still prefer MF (though The Voyage is still the most intense ride overall there is, in my opinion.)    Like I said before though, roller coasters are subjective, and everybody is entitled to like or dislike any coaster at their whim.  I just always have felt compelled to point out the factual errency in calling MF forceless, regardless of ones opinion of the ride itself.  (Believe me, all my enthusiast friends have heard this contention as well, I'm not just picking on you! ;) )"
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,The_DILinator,7,Wed Jul 8 06:36:56 2015 UTC,Gatekeeper.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,drbeer,2,Mon Jul 6 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"I was going to saw this as well, I knew probably a dozen people that went to the media day for the ride and all of them told me it was a really good ride. When I finally rode it it was just slow and meh. Riding it later in the front made it a bit better but it's still not all that great of a ride."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,acu2005,18,Mon Jul 6 01:38:15 2015 UTC,Ya'll are crazy. I love Gatekeeper because you can enjoy the ride from any row - you don't have to wait for a front seat. To me it's like soaring up and around the front of the park - it's just a very fun ride. It doesn't have to be intense to be a good time!
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,allysonlovescats,3,Mon Jul 6 02:36:21 2015 UTC,"It does suffer slightly from the ""Cedar Point"" bar of what I expect.  But at the end of the day, its still kind of a boring, force-less ride in my opinion."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,drbeer,7,Mon Jul 6 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't see it, though I know many people feel the same as you.  I love the ride!  It's my third favorite coaster at CP after MF and Maverick!  Yes, it's very deliberate going through its course, but I just love the smoothness, and the flow from one graceful element to the next.  And it's a beautiful coaster to look at, and be on!  To each their own I guess..."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,The_DILinator,5,Mon Jul 6 07:38:57 2015 UTC,I agree it's an amazing coaster! Sure it's not sure intense like the maverick or super fast like MF. But it's nice to have a little variance in roller coaster types instead of just having the same type. If every roller coaster was air time coasters that went super fast people would get bored of them. I think gatekeeper is not only a great ride but it makes CP whole
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,jutop42,2,Mon Jul 6 07:45:30 2015 UTC,"Same as another comment on here, Pepsi Max Big One was pretty dull after the first drop. Also Goudurix at Park Asterix was pretty lame considering the amount of inversions. Far too rough for my liking."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,talmo91,2,Mon Jul 6 09:38:14 2015 UTC,"The first time I rode nemesis inferno. For some reason it was really un-intense. However, now it's my favourite coaster at Thorpe Park."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,Fa7Tony,4,Mon Jul 6 16:03:33 2015 UTC,For me it was Mamba at Worlds of Fun -it was my 200th credit and gave it some unnecessary pageantry- and after seeing it on coaster shows and specials growing up It became somewhat of a white whale but in the end it was not a much of a gem. I was happy to find other great rides in the park though.

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,lucidflower,9,Mon Jul 6 04:49:57 2015 UTC,Haha that's so funny because the smoothness was what I enjoyed about it. I don't like a lot of cobra rolls because they usually end up knocking my head around but Dominator's is probably the smoothest I've ever been through.

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,jutop42,2,Mon Jul 6 05:21:37 2015 UTC,"There are probably a few that deserve this tag, but the one that immediately comes to mind is Goliath at SFMM.  It looked great, and I heard that the final helix was amazing.  But when I rode it I got off and found it entirely unremarkable.  I rode it again when I returned to SFMM years later, and still felt the same way.  A very ""meh"" ride in my book, and certainly one I would skip if I were pressed for time on a visit to SFMM!"
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,The_DILinator,4,Mon Jul 6 07:48:38 2015 UTC,Goliath was my first hyper coaster and I thought it was awesome...

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,SethRader,3,Mon Jul 6 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"Did you ride it before the lady died of a brain aneurysm while riding it?  After that incident, they really clamped down the mid track brakes.  Totally ruined the final helix.  It was one of the more intense helices I've ever experienced.

I guess I just heard so much hype about it before riding it, so I was expecting it to jump up into my top woodies, so in that respect it was a major disappointment. The Raven is a much better ride at that park, IMO."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:06:14 2015 UTC,Yep.  My wife and I drove down to Holiday World for our anniversary because of the Voyage.  Maybe it wasn't running well or something but neither of us found it very intense or mind-blowing as so many people have claimed.  Two rides in the back and one in the front and we walked out of Holiday World stating The Raven was our favorite coaster in the park.  It was a huge disappointment.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,ZeroCignal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:27:15 2015 UTC,This is such a disappointment to hear. I rode it the summer it opened and the second half was one of the best sections on any ride I've ever been on. Super smooth intense and surprising.  This is why I hate ptc trains even if they are iconic. They tear the hell out of the track.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,fidgetting,2,Fri Jul 10 04:53:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I wish they could have made the Timberliner trains work out. It's definitely a love letter to coaster enthusiasts the way the layout was designed. If it wasn't for the roughness it would be a fantastic ride. I guess now they're fully stopping the trains on the MCBR to try and reduce the intensity at the end.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,RealNotFake,2,Fri Jul 10 13:36:04 2015 UTC,The Beast.   I still can't understand who likes and enjoys that kind of pain.
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,TwisterII,11,Mon Jul 6 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"Really? I don't find the Beast to be particularly painful, all things considered. I think Vortex, Flight of Fear, Firehawk, and Racer all hurt way worse than the Beast on my last trip to KI."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,exp09,6,Mon Jul 6 02:51:30 2015 UTC,Vortex is one of the most painful coasters I've ever been on. Probably second to the Carolina cyclone

It was my third favorite ride at the park, but compared to other B&M Inverts?  Not mind-blowing.  Montu, Banshee, Alpengeist, and Dueling Dragons (what they were called when I rode it) were all much better in my opinion, and I'd even rank Silver Bullet over it.

rollercoasters,3c8rx1,foilfencer591,2,Mon Jul 6 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"I did.  I would also, I guess, like to formally apologize for this opinion.  The downvotes it has received has made me realize that this opinion is wrong.  But seriously, rode it back when Superman and MF were jockeying back and forth for the top steel coaster position in the Golden Ticket awards (and I know, the awards mean nothing, yada yada) but it still remained that they were two coasters in quote unquote contention with one another.   And for me they were like night and day.  MF is an incredibly paced ride with amazing views and intense lateral/vertical G's, awesome tunnel sections, etc.  Superman was a basic out and back with an uninspired spaghetti bowl at the end.  I just didn't get the hype that surrounded it.  I still don't."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,kbups53,3,Mon Jul 6 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"I didnt downvote you, you are entitled to your opinion. I think the reason you are getting downvoted is because of the tone of your comment. You make it as if Bizarro has no right being considered anywhere close to MF, which is simply not the case. There's a reason both of these coasters have been number one multiple times over the past decade. I can get over its layout being ""uninspired"" because every element is chock full of force. IMO, Bizarro utilizes its layout far better than MF, as there is never a dull point during the ride. But again, we are here to express opinions."
rollercoasters,3c8rx1,foilfencer591,3,Mon Jul 6 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"I think that, in many respects, Bizarro/SRoS and MF are just vastly different rides that appeal to different people. MF seems to be about speed and some positive G's for the most part, which some people seem to be crazy about. Maybe the overall impression with layout and scenery as well, since I've seen that talked about. I'd bet that there's a lot of overlap between MF and i305 fans.   On the other hand, I really love negative G's and feeling tossed around, which is why I love Bizarro/Maverick. MF was a disappointment because I was expecting something more like the former and it didn't really deliver in that respect.  It's kind of a shame that there's so much contention over the two, but when you have two coasters in close competition that appeal to very different tastes, I guess that's just how it goes."

rollercoasters,3c47q4,dakanektr,3,Sat Jul 4 16:49:44 2015 UTC,I wonder what kind of process the train/track/employees have to go through to run backwards?   There's no way it can be as simple as just throwing the train on backwards.
rollercoasters,3c47q4,TwisterII,3,Sat Jul 4 19:12:37 2015 UTC,"The train is not that much different from a normal train. What they did is basically take the seat section and reverse the seats. The top part of the train is forward facing and is built exactly as a regular train. All they really have to do is put the trains on and run them. There were new bolt holes put into the top of the train section so that the seat sections could be reversed. With a few modifications to the OTSR release mechanisms. Other then that there really is no difference in the top part of the trains. So they will run more or less on any B&M inverted coaster.   You can see in this pic that they remove one row of seats due to them not fitting in the station. And you can see how the top section is forward facing as would be normal of any B&M invert.    The trains were created by Six Flags, they have two of them and are moved from park to park."
rollercoasters,3c47q4,JohnnyUpsidedown,2,Sat Jul 4 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"So Six Flags packs up this specific train, plus one other, and ships it from park to park across the country every few months? No wonder why this company is broke."
rollercoasters,3c47q4,TwisterII,3,Sat Jul 4 21:04:48 2015 UTC,"Yes they move the trains from park to park. But you have to think about advertising dollars. Get people to come to the park to get a once in a lifetime ride on a coaster. It really does not cost that much to move a coaster train around. Just a truck and driver.   Mostly its all an attempt to get more peeps in the park. Each peep is about 50.00 in there pocket, considering average money spent by each person, food, souvenirs, parking and other things in the park."
rollercoasters,3c47q4,JohnnyUpsidedown,3,Sat Jul 4 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, they only usually send a small portion of the backwards train between parks. Just the chassis is traded around, and then each park uses parts from their normal trains to form the backwards train. You can verify this by looking at pictures of the backwards trains at different parks. They all have different combinations of colors of seat posts (black or grey), seats (purple or black), restraints (yellow, black, or yellow&black) and wheel coverings (some have different decals).  However, Great Adventure and Over Georgia came up with a great idea to minimize ride downtime at each park to only 1 day! Instead of having Over Georgia disassemble their backwards train, send the parts up to NJ, disassemble GAdv's train, and reassemble GAdv's train backwards, they just swapped complete trains. Both Batman rides took 1 train off and sent it to the other park, while each ride remained open with 1 train each. As soon as the first set of trains were received, the two parks swapped their other set of trains. I verified this with the park's PR department. It only took about a day to test Batman Backwards at Great Adventure and have it approved by the state. It opened early with 1 train, then 2 trains the next day. I am pretty sure this is the first time Six Flags has actually shipped an entire backwards train to another park."

rollercoasters,3c47q4,bear-ginger,2,Sun Jul 5 23:35:38 2015 UTC,How is it? I'm riding it this Wednesday.
rollercoasters,3c2dls,Imaginos64,3,Sat Jul 4 03:03:57 2015 UTC,"Today I made the trip to two parks in Maine that I had yet to check out; Funtown Splashtown USA and the nearby Palace Playland at Old Orchard Beach. I stopped at Palace Playland first to ride their Galaxi coaster and their Orient Express. This was a major nostalgia trip for me since a different Galaxi model was the first coaster I ever rode as a kid. It was really cool to ride one again; it’s a pity these are disappearing because they’re great family coasters. The Orient Express was fun too. That first little helix is surprisingly intense for a kiddie coaster. The ride op sent the train through three times so I guess I got my money’s worth along with the credit. I wanted to ride the Zamperla Power Surge but by the time I got to it the ride ops were no where to be found and I didn’t feel like waiting around to see what was up. I’ll catch one at Knoebels later on. I also rode Adrenaline, a pendulum ride that provided great ejector air but had a very short cycle. Over all I was impressed with how pleasant and tidy Palace Playland was for a little seaside park. Unfortunately it’s a bit pricey with not a lot to do plus parking at the beach is a pain so I’m not sure I’ll be racing to return.  Next I headed to Funtown Splashtown USA eager to ride their CCI woodie, Excalibur. After dealing with the beach crowds and concrete jungle of Palace Playland this charming little park was just what I needed. Most the people seemed to be in the water park so crowds were minimal in the dry park. I was able to thoroughly marathon Excalibur and try out every seat. The verdict? It’s an awesome hidden gem of a coaster. The laterals are crazy on this one and my favorite part was during the first half after the bunny hop when you go back uphill and you get a crazy pop of air as the train dives into a right turn. This was especially prominent in certain seats. A big complaint many people have with this coaster is that it sort of dies out during the second half. I have a mixed opinion on this myself. My first couple rides were in the back and I got off thinking, “What are those people talking about? That whole ride was wild!”. The last couple turns provide incredible laterals and I felt that it held its speed well throughout. However, when I rode towards the front I was very aware of how much slower the second half was; a pity for an excellent coaster with a wonderful location in the woods.  Taking a break from Excalibur I rode the park’s wild mouse (Named, appropriately enough, “Wild Mouse”). It’s fun for what it is especially since it tuns without much braking. I skipped most the flats but one that I did ride was a stand out and that was Astrophere. It’s an indoor scrambler similar to Canobie Lake Park’s Psychodrome. Though Canobie’s runs faster, Funtown’s strobes, periods of darkness, and light show set to “Fire on High” by ELO beat out Canobie’s effects by a mile. I found it much more of a relaxing break between Excalibur marathons than a true thrill ride but it was still a blast.  If you find yourself in the state of Maine I would highly recommend snagging a few (Or 10, or 20!) rides on Excalibur. It’s worth it. As for me, my next adventure will be Holiday World/Six Flags Great America/Cedar Point. I can’t wait to see how The Raven and The Legend compare to Excalibur. Thanks for reading!"

rollercoasters,3c2dls,JEEntertainment89,3,Sat Jul 4 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"Raven is probably most similar to Excalibur, and Legend is like 2.5 Ravens.. And then Voyage is just on an entire different plane of existence. Make sure you ride them in that order too, Raven, Legend, Voyage. It's amazing to see the jumps in the differences.  CCI was an awesome company. It's amazing how many are simply gone [EDIT- only 3 gone, 2 SBNO], or just ride terribly now.  Rides like Raven, Legend, Excalibur and others are proof that you can have an amazing ride (that doesn't cost 30+ million, sorry Fury) for many years, you just have to maintain it properly. I wish Cedar Fair and Six Flags understood this."

My only concern is that I have to leave the park sometime in the late afternoon and I have no idea how crowds are; I already know I'm going to fall in love with The Voyage and want as many rides as possible so it's going to be hard to save the best for last.  Sadly I think a lot of the big parks are solely focused on the next record breaking new coaster they can build and successfully market to drum up attendance instead of looking after some of the amazing coasters, particularly the woodies, that they already have. I'm a big fan of wooden coasters and it's a pity to see so many of them either removed or neglected."

rollercoasters,3c2jfn,bchris24,6,Sat Jul 4 13:56:31 2015 UTC,Here on the West Coast the big rumor is whether RMC is going to upgrade Roar in SFDK or Ghostrider in Knotts. SFMM just got their new RMC ride so they are out of the picture. CGA got a new woody several years ago as well and I doubt they are going to upgrade Grizzly (the only upgrade that ride needs is by being burned down).   That leaves SFDK and Knotts. SFDK seemed like the frontrunner first since Roar is becoming aged and starting to run a little rough. SF already has quite the history with RMC so it would make sense they would be in talks again. However it seems like a lot of workers at Knotts have been saying something big is being planned and it would make a lot of sense if it was an RMC retracking of Ghostrider
rollercoasters,3c2jfn,bchris24,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:23:04 2015 UTC,Yah I have heard more on ghostrider getting love than Roar... is Ghostrider really getting that rough?
rollercoasters,3c2jfn,JohnnyUpsidedown,2,Sat Jul 4 13:55:52 2015 UTC,Last time I rode it was 3 years ago and it was horrible. I know how historic it is and I love the layout but after that I was done with riding it unless it got any sort of retracking. It's just not fun. Roar just got retracked in the off-season and is running better. So if the RMC job goes to Ghostrider it will be a win win no matter what.

I would think that a hilly hyper coaster will also be added as the park does not have one. Something like what they did with Carowinds, new entrance and new coaster around it.   Knotts... rumor of topper track on Ghostrider, no change in layout.   BGT... I speculate and have been getting a feeling that they may do a RMC to Gwazi. With a new CEO in the park chain and letting go of Attchinson. The park has seen what 6Flags has done with some of there coasters. So my though is maybe they are changing there minds and could do something with it, instead of just tearing it down.   CP... rumored 235 ft tall dive coaster with a tunnel and a water splash. I speculate the splash will be over the main drop so you would look down the drop to a pond heading into a tunnel.   CF parks in general. I think they will get into the RMC stuff eventually, Mean Streak and other coasters at the parks will get RMCed one day.   SFMid America... I would speculate that the Boss will one day also get RMCed or topper tracked leaving the layout. Some of the old coasters need to be saved or at least the layouts preserved. With the topper track you can create a better ride but keep a decent layout.  SFOG... I have thought that they may get a wing coaster, the new GM was very impressed with the one at SFGAmer. It could also be that they may get one of the Batman free spins as rumored for SFGadvent.  Kentucky Kingdom... Work has already started on the RMC conversion with track being removed. Looks like a full iron horse making this a steel coaster.  As I stated in the top this is all just speculation. I have no foundations for anything just rumors and speculation on what seems logical at some of the parks."

BGT- something is in the works, in my opinion the lack of action after closing tells us that. Having never ridden an RMC I don't really have a stance on how I feel about the retrofit; but, would love to see something other than demolition.  Unless it is Giga footers ;)  CF- I feel that is pretty much exactly correct."
rollercoasters,3c2jfn,Hedgey,2,Sun Jul 5 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"KI.. Don H the PR guy hinted at something coming to the building last year while on a tour. Lots of peeps asked about it. CFs new CEO stated all parks will get a dark ride. So with Banshee pretty new it just seems logical but anything can happen.   BGT.. Dont know on the GIGA. With SW getting a hyper dont think BGT will also, at least not a B&M. They usually have a proximity agreement with other parks in a certain distance to not build same type ride for 7 years. So could always be an Intiman. However can GIGAS and HYPERS be considered different type rides.  On Gwazi guess i would rather they keep it and do something with it then tear it down. Seems to me the Cobra Curse ride could have been put there instead. So have the feeling they might do something with it."

I'm thinking that next year we'll get a flat ride, maybe a super loop since the chain is so keen on those lately and we do need an inverting flat. The park has said that 2017 is going to be a big year so I think we'll either see the rumored Superman conversion or a new coaster. They did say we're supposed to get another coaster within the next few years...  My hopes personally? Get Bizarro back to #1 territory with new restraints and no more audio. Fix the issues with Goliath and its train. Get rid of Flashback. Add a couple thrilling flats. Replace Mind Eraser with a new coaster, maybe a launch coaster. Start running a better cycle on Tomahawk."

I hate Goliath, but that just makes no sense.   For Bizarro, they just need to remove the audio on the carts, that should fix the visuals. All the other effects IMO enhance it over Supes. That's just me though.    What they need to do is either get rid of or get new trains for mind eraser. The new vekoma trains should at least help the rattle.  They also need to invest in flat rides. They cant keep removing flat rides without adding anything... Or adding planters where the ride was (that's the worst)   Overall, the park has a real flow problem that needs to be addressed. The side where WC and SScreamer are is extremely congested, and that has been the case even before the new coaster."

So I'm thinking they're planning on removing Flashback in the future. I don't see them keeping two of basically the same coasters next to each other.   I think they should do something with Batman, maybe new trains, backwards?   Get rid of Poison Ivy it's an eye sore. Maybe expand The Hall of Justice, and make it like the ride in Texas.  I also had no idea about the Batman Mouse trap ride, I really don't think it was a good choice for them, too plain and boring. Although I guess it's a good alternative if they get ride of Poison Ivy  That's all I can really think of right now, not much more room for any big coasters, only if they remove Mind Eraser any put a new coaster in that spot.

rollercoasters,3c1h8w,Woirol,4,Sat Jul 4 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"As bad as it sounds, its almost better for a park to have someone killed than for someone to be brutally injured.    I don't see Smiler ever opening back up.  It sounds like Merlin needs to go in and and retrain all of their maintenance division, hire more and bring in specialists to check every ride their to make sure everything is good.  They need to be very public about the fact they are rechecking every ride, post how much they are spending on safety, and make it your main focus for a while now.  After a while, and maybe some slower seasons, things will be back to normal.    Gerstlauer on the other hand needs to be very public about designing new safety systems and offering yo work with parks to check their existing rides.    Alton Towers luckily has the benefit of being a bigger park and being part of a bigger company, so I don't see as big of a deal as the Kentucky Kingdom accident that basically shut down that park.  I'm also not familiar with how lawsuit happy the British population is.    Overall, I think AT will bounce back, Gerstlauer on the other hand will have parks being hesitant towards buying from them after this and New Texas Giant.  I think they will have a bigger issue than AT."

After the Texas Giant death it seems like every park has added seat belts to rides to help prevent that from happening. I dont see much changing from this accident. The block system failed due to the computer or human error. There isnt much a park can do other than train their ride ops the dangers of overriding a security feature.

What likely happened is that after the first train valleyed, someone reset the blocks without noticing it, then returned it to normal operation. This caused the computer to think that the block occupied by the valleyed train was empty... and the rest is history.

Emotions cloud the reality that coasters are extremely safe, and I'm saying this as a ride op at one of the biggest coasters in the world and an engineering student. The amount of redundancies in coasters is astonishing, and there are very few places I feel safer in.   EDIT: Whenever I read news about coasters in the media, I am appalled at the amount of misinformation or ignorance presented. I don't waste my time trying to correct every little tiny thing, such as calling an inversion a ""loop"" or making a news story out of a coaster stopping on the lift, also known as a coaster doing what it was programmed to do. Coasters will continue to get safer, more thrilling and more innovative, and the Alton Tower incident will not be the catalyst; coasters have been doing this since their inception."

I'm disappointed in Alton Towers, I love the park, I think it's the best in the UK but this shouldn't have happened.  I think this will take a long time to blow over and I don't mean that in any disrespect to the victims of the accident, this was a severely life changing event that just can't be pushed to the side."

The Alton Towers incident is unfortunate, but all of this unnecessary reporting is trying to incite fear into the population so media can make a quick buck. If people would take the time to learn about these machines, they would approach this situation much more intelligently. Ignorance breeding ignorance DOES NOT help the situation.

rollercoasters,3c1h8w,MrFlamingQueen,5,Sat Jul 4 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if Alton Towers are being overly cautious, stopping rides for something they would never have before and this is resulting in more rides stopping than average.  The problem Alton Towers will face when they decide to reopen The Smiler, is that the story will be more about the accident and any time Alton Towers is mentioned in the future, they will mention the accident.  It's also a weird situation, Roller Coasters need to give the illusion of danger. Oblivion gives a pre show that the ride will not end well for the rider, I actually wonder if that will change in the future. Anybody who knows a little about theme park knows that you're more likely to die on the way to a park than in it."

The odd, and extraordinarily unique, thing about it is that it's a stand-up roller coaster that gives you airtime. A SHITTON of airtime. If you're sitting in the back left seat (by far the best out of the 24 on the other clones, not quite as good on this one), you get ejector air on the first drop, crushing Gs into the loop, massive ejector air over the first hill and into the helix, crushing Gs in the helix, then massive air over the second hill.

rollercoasters,3c0pas,ExactlyUnlikeTea,2,Sat Jul 4 13:07:36 2015 UTC,the distribution of weight both across and along the train makes a huge difference as Maverix08 said. I have had very smooth and not smooth rides in the same seat.
rollercoasters,3c0pas,brentd86,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"In my experience smoothness in Wild Eagle greatly depends on whether or not there is equal weight on the wings (this applies to all wing coasters really). Whenever I ride it with all 4 seats in the row filled it's butter smooth and fantastic (little bland force wise but still) and on the flip side, riding on an outside seat with no-one else in the row was headache inducing. And this was in the same seat on the same train. So i imagine then if the weight difference is to great it'll cause some vibrations but it's not the track or wheels that causes it."
rollercoasters,3c0pas,ExactlyUnlikeTea,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:42:43 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a lateral shaking, it was a sort of slipping vibration. I don't know how well the car was weighted so you could be right"
rollercoasters,3c0pas,rr499,2,Sat Jul 4 21:29:16 2015 UTC,That sounds about right to me for what the vibration would be. It's definitely not lateral but it's not a silky smooth ride.

I thought it would be a great ride, on par with Colorado Adventure in Phantasialand, but it's more of a kids ride.  Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain: It looks great in my eyes. I really like the look of this coaster. But I don't like the ride at all. The first drop isn't great and all the turns are boring.  Additionally: Almost half of the ""old"" wooden rollercoasters.

The lack of shade and uninspired theming of the rest of the park is why I have it so low on the list.
rollercoasters,3c0gq1,jpezzznuts,2,Sun Jul 5 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"I've been to every Cedar Fair Park except Dorney and California's Great America.  Now, bear in mind, some of them I haven't been to in years, or since they added major new coasters or other additions (since my coaster travelling has been severely restricted since beginning to have my four kids 11 years ago), so my ranks will be based off of my personal experience there, and appearances/word of mouth from others who have been there more recently, and ridden what I have not.   Cedar Point - While it has some stiff competition from other parks I've been to, I think only one park in the CF chain really comes close to the ""Roller Coaster Capital of the World""! Canada's Wonderland - This is that one park that comes close, and I haven't been there since Leviathan or Wonder Mountain Guardian.  It's an excellent park, no doubt!   Kings Island - This gets my narrow vote over Kings Dominion, simply because I've been there more recently, and have ridden every coaster.  It also is the prettiest CF park, in my opinion. Kings Dominion - Full disclosure: I haven't been here since it became a CF park, so a lot has changed.  I imagine once I get back there again, it might move up my ranks.  However, I have ridden Dominator at Geagua Lake, so the only major new coaster I haven't ridden is I-305.  I do really like this park, however! Worlds of Fun - This is another park I haven't been to in a while, so this ranking is based off of glowing reports on Prowler I have received, as well as the addition of Patriot (I like Inverts), and the subtraction of Orient Express.  Considering I really enjoyed the park before, I think this is a fair placement. Carowinds - I finally went here this year after wanting to for years, and anticipating it highly...  and came away disappointed, for the most part.  Fury is my new favorite coaster, Intimidator is an awesome hyper, and Afterburn is definitely a fun Invert!  I didn't think much of any of the other coasters, however, and the park was not very well shaded, other than in the County Fair section.   Knott's Berry Farm - I was tempted to put this above Carowinds, but hey - Fury's amazingness has to be worth something extra, right?  Knott's was a pleasant park.  Some really nice coasters (Xcelerator, Silver Bullet, kinda Ghostrider), but not many exciting ones overall.   Valleyfair - I wrestled with putting this on the bottom, as I was very unimpressed with this park when I went.  However, Renegade wasn't there when I was there, so that ultimately gives this park the prospective boost it needs to get out of the cellar - barely.  Michigan's Adventure - As much as it pains me, since this is my ""home park"", this is not a great amusement park by any stretch.  Honestly, I think CF is intentionally holding the park down to keep Michiganders from ever considering visiting here, instead of nearby Cedar Point, but that is a different topic, for a different thread...  Shivering Timbers is one of the best coasters in the world, but everything else is so ""meh"", it can't quite pull this park out of the cellar - assuming Renegade is as good as I think it looks like.  Otherwise, I'd take MiA over Valleyfair."

rollercoasters,3c0gq1,Woirol,3,Sat Jul 4 01:23:02 2015 UTC,"Shivering Timbers certainly didn't blow me away like I was expecting, which was a real disappointment.  Still a fun ride obviously, but by no means Top 10 or anything.  Got to love the Cedar Fair effect on woodies.  I can understand why they don't put big rides in, there's just no return on investment to be made in Muskegon, Michigan. The market just isn't there. There's always the chicken and the egg debate, ""well if they add a coaster that will bring people,"" but how many of those people would show up once (if that) and never again?  Michigan's Adventure is a small family park, that probably should have stayed a small family park. For the most part I think Cedar Fair is running it correctly, but since they have all these other properties with giant coasters going in every year, people look at MiA and say, ""what gives?""  It's really not fair."
rollercoasters,3c0gq1,JamminJay1986,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:32:54 2015 UTC,"As somebody who has been going to Michigan's Adventure since it was Deer Park Funland, I have to disagree somewhat with your appraisal of the situation regard Cedar Fair and MiA.  Other than minor infrastructure improvements (which I am not discounting - they were very good moves), nothing has really changed other than a transplanted hang n bang coaster that wasn't great to begin with.  In fact, they have steadily removed even the smaller flat rides, further depleting what little there was to do already.  Yes, the water park is fantastic, and I DO think Shivering Timbers is a world class coaster, and I've ridden over 200 coasters.  But the park does need a spark, something to draw new crowds, and make them a place people will go out of the way for.  Look at Holiday World?  Knoebels?  These are small family parks that are revered in enthusiast circles because they have the coasters, and park experience to merit going out of the way to go there.  MiA could be that too with the right coaster addition, and at the very least, it would give those of us locally who have longed for the park to do something - anything - exciting for over a decade.  Ironically, back when it WAS a family owned park, plans were in place to add a new coaster, but CF scrapped them...    I firmly beleive the reason CF is not putting anything major there is to keep Michiganders from saying ""Wow! This park is really good!  We don't even need to make our annual trip to Cedar Point this year!""  From where I live, it is only a half hour closer to go to MiA, and for those in the Detroit area, CP is actually closer.  We already saw what CF does to parks that are too close to competing with its crown jewel in the awful fate of Geagua Park - which was a much better park than MiA!  They're certainly not going to build up MiA and have it become a destination, because they're making a ton of money as it is, and don't want the competition for CP.  So, it's an understandable win/win for CF to hold back MiA.  Unfortunately, it's a lose/lose for those of us who have been with the park for years, and have seen it abruptly stop growing, and slowly slip in irrelevance, despite the fact it could be so much more..."

My third favorite CP coater is GateKeeper, which is way better than Afterburn, in my opinion, and both TTD and Magnum would be better than Afterburn as well.  If I were splitting up park vs. coasters, I would actually have Carowinds as a park slightly better better than Carowinds for coasters.  FWIW, I think KD, CW, and KI can also make compelling arguments for their top 3 over Carowinds'.    Obviously, coasters are very subjective, but this is my perspective on the issue."

I thought their coaster collection was surprisingly sub-par.  Other than the big 3, their best coaster is Nighthawk, which isn't a good thing, in my opinion.  I'll definitely be back, and it may become my home park in a few years when I move down to North Carolina, but I'll probably just marathon Fury and Intimidator most of my time there."
