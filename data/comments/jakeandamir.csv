Just write their name in there and it will be counted This is the the big one. The Jew cowards at survey monkey only allow me to have 100 respondents per survey, which i didn't think we were going to pass, but we did. As of right now there have been 200 respondents to this survey and i am only able to view 100 of them. So that is the bad news, although the good news is that i can create as many surveys as i want. So firstly i would ask anybody that has yet to take the survey to not click the link above but instead click this link. This link is an exact copy of the last survey but with a different link so it can hold another 100 respondents.    Thank you  -Yours Bitchly"

Who is going to remember exactly when they started watching their content.   ""Allot""  You should let people select more than one answer for who they want to be on the podcast, forcing people to pick one doesn't allow a real distribution of desires to be formed.  Question 8 is literally retarded.  There is almost no logical flow to the questions, starting out with one demographics question, having a bunch of questions about J&A and then throwing in other random demographic questions at the end.   Also, only having one real response for where people are from? At least fucking try to put a little bit of effort into it. The USA isn't the only fucking country in the world, and forcing people to parse through individual responses gets rid of the fucking point of trying to get the demographics of where people are from. It comes off as offensive and amateurish.   Why not add in an other option for gender? It's 2015, this shit is standard now.   The whole survey comes across like a child wrote it."

I don't know if it was because Drake wasn't as big then as he is now or if it were because I was totally ignorant of the new hip hop scene (probably that, lewronggeneration phase lol), but I just thought the joke was that Drake wasn't a real person because I didn't think it was a real name haha  EDIT: actually im pretty sure im retarded i just rewatched the video, its because jake and drake rhyme? lol fuck"
