Fantasy,3e3cdz,DrBodyguard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"My response is a bit meta, unfortunately.  I am currently reading The Sword of Shannara, but the annotated edition.  I am finding the annotations to be unintentionally hilarious, as they are incredibly serious and ignore all of the problems with the book.  I haven't read it in decades, so I am largely coming at it as if I am reading it for the first time.  The writing is clunky, the descriptions are overdrawn, and the characterization is rough.  Of course, it is a first novel, and Brooks gets better as his writing goes on.  But I just wonder what went through his mind as he was rereading this and annotating it.  There are pages and pages with no comments at all, and I just wish there was more, where he would talk about the problems and how he learned from them.  The funniest thing so far is what I read last night, where he told his whole theory on brothers, where he had already had two sets of brothers who got along, so he figured that he now needed a set of brothers who did not get along.  Really?  Was that really what he thought about as he was writing it in the 1970s?"

If you have, I would like to mention the greatest brick joke in webcomic history. In the beginning of the comic strip, Black mage is running away from a giant. He consults a gaming magazine on the way and rejects one solution because it requires four White Mages to work. At the end, the Big Bad of the series reveals himself and is about to destroy the anti heroes and the world when he explodes. When the dust settles, what do we see? Four White mages. From set up to punchline it was nine years and about two thousand pages worth of comics.  Also I would like to mention another great joke but this one I won't spoil. The identity of Sarda, the demented all powerful mage who has been toying with the party from the moment they met him.  Edit - In case you don't accept webcomics (in which case shame on you) I have another one. In Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora we get the fantastic line 'There's a few things I'm going to ask him.

So he goes on a murderous rampage, mercilessly slaughtering the enemy army, using his own band of psychopathic friends and a bunch of goat herders in the process. He does so out of pure stubbornness and rage.  The scene itself is not funny at all, it's actually rather morbid, but his single-mindedness and zeal really rubbed off on me.

Fantasy,3e2wni,NameIdeas,26,Tue Jul 21 15:26:03 2015 UTC,This is why I love raymond feist's books.  They are groups of trilogies set in the same world that all lead to the final battle/outcome at the end of the last series.  So you get that epic world feel without the slog like you see in wheel of time or other long serieses.  I stopped WoT in the middle of book 8 a year ago because it was just too much.  But am now on book 11 of the dresden files so I cant totally hate on the long ones.
Fantasy,3e2wni,lepfrog,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:34 2015 UTC,Plus the decade long gaps between each series guarantees the world grows and changes.  Going off of the Riftwar Cycle I started WoT when TGS was on sale.  I remember seeing the cover and thinking it was Rand's son or ancestor depicted considering how I was used to time passing.

I cannot believe the series takes place in 2 years. Once I realized I was wrong about the wheel-turning, I thought from looking at the covers that Rand et al had aged decades! Hm...

But even in the wild reaching Feist world, I get a little lost between trilogies.  If you haven't read one in a long time, it's hard to jump right back in.  Don't get me wrong, I think that is a great way to do the ""epic"" style, but I don't know if it is any easier."
Fantasy,3e2wni,10aciousTed,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:57 2015 UTC,Only trilogy I ever finished was The Broken Empire. And perhaps in 2056 when the 3rd Patrick Rothfuss book comes out then I will have finished 2.
Fantasy,3e2wni,8nate,5,Tue Jul 21 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"They're different reads, but I do prefer a trilogy because I feel like the pacing is a little better and the story stays more focused. A long epic is great but sometimes it can get too confusing with all the characters and subplots, but overall it's still great. But I think nowadays we see a nice combination of the two: multiple trilogies set in the same world. It allows for all the awesome pacing of a trilogy that tells a larger story. I think it started with Feist and maybe even before with Terry Brooks. But now Mark Lawrence is at it with the Broken Empire and Red Queen's War set in the same universe, and R. Scott Bakker is doing it with his Second Apocalypse Trilogy. I think it's a great thing, because you can read the trilogy, take a break and read something else, then return for the next trilogy. It's a pretty good union of ideas."
Fantasy,3e2wni,Eastclare,8,Tue Jul 21 16:02:42 2015 UTC,Robin Hobbs are similar- lots of interweaving stories. So you get the world building without the 'kill-me-now' feeling I sometimes get in around book 6/7.  I really like that structure.

It's cool staying in the same world, but if I were to try to dive back in now, I would be LOST!  I enjoyed Baker's Prince of Nothing series and wanted to read more of his stuff.  I might keep going.  Keeping stuff in the same world is great, but sometimes they try to link the trilogies almost too much so that you can't remember who did what or with whom.  The long epics are fun, but yeah...a bit much these days."
Fantasy,3e2wni,crowqueen,6,Tue Jul 21 16:59:06 2015 UTC,"I have not so far completely abandoned a series. If I make it far enough I will be invested to an extent that I would like some closure. It may move down lower on priority. Like instead of instant pre order I will pick it up when I feel like it.  It also helps knowing if there is an end in sight. If I know there are only 4 books or so left, I will likely persevere. If it is up in the air I may cut my losses.  Although, as I said, I have not had to deal with this yet. It is speculation really.  I think I am more likely to decide in the first book or so. If I am not enjoying it at that point, I will drop it, if I make it past that, I will persevere. Probably."
Fantasy,3e2wni,JW_BM,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"I stop reading a book when I'm done with it. Sometimes this is even 90% of the way through, but I just don't care any more and am wanting to get on with something else more interesting. I don't tend to care about waiting for something. There is plenty to be getting on with in the mean time. The only series I'm fully up to date on are the Mistborn books and ASOIAF, so there may well be a time when this matters more to me, but I'm not on the edge my seat waiting for Shadows of Self or Bands of Mourning, and I've largely given up on Winds of Winter so it will be a nice bonus when it comes out rather than anything else. (I have just about resigned myself to the fact that we'll never get another Hunger Games book ;). Sad, I know, but my heart leapt when I saw someone reading another Suzanne Collins book at the station, only to find out it was a different, older series :( :( :(). A lot of things - compelling plot, exciting characters, the usual ingredients of a good story. I think it helps if the conclusion of the previous books leaves a few things hanging: it makes me more eager to read the successive books rather than let things go for a while. I know writers need to finish the book off to the point where they're not just ending in the middle of a sentence or scene, but case in point here is the Daughter of the Empire books: I read the first one in 2009 and again in 2012, intending to read the second book, and then never got round to opening it (it's still pristine from where I used a birthday book token to buy it; I got into ASOIAF instead which swept me off my feet). It took me twenty-two years to get round to reading the next two books in the Forgotten Realms Avatar series (Shadowdale was one of the first non-Tolkien fantasy books I ever possessed), and I still haven't read the two published later about how spoiler even though this series is ancient."

I remember that I read the first 7 books of the Malazan series. And I still haven't read the final three because I remembered when I picked up the eight book I couldn't make heads or tails of it.   Even now, I picked up the audible versions for listening at work, but the idea of something like 400 hours of listening is a little scary.

I'm even a bit weary when looking at a new 'trilogy.' I hate the idea of picking up a book and then having to wait years to finish them. I change so much in between each book that I can't get into the same headspace that I was when I originally read the book. For example if/when the third day of the Kingkiller trilogy is released I probably won't pick it up, as even though I loved the books when they first came out, I tried rereading the first book a few months back and couldn't get into it anymore."

Fantasy,3e2wni,Voidrith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"I am not willing to read a book that promises something great at the end of book 7 if book 1 is a slow, derivative piece of boredom that ends without resolving anything.  I will happily read sequels to a book that entertained me. But I'm really not willing to give an author more than about 700-800 pages to tell a single story. I have too many other things to do to hold a story in my head that long.  I have no problems with ""the continuing adventures of a fun character"" or ""another story in a neat world"". I'll happily pick up a fourth Locke Lamora book or a forty-leventh Discworld (RIP Pterry) or whatever. But these are authors who have a proven ability to tell a story that will leave me feeling satisfied when I finish the last page.  (There are, of course, exceptions, she says, glancing at the second omnibus of Wolfe's ""Book of the New Sun"" sitting on the coffee table waiting for her to pick it up. Wolfe's magnificent prose and oblique worldbuilding provides more than enough reading pleasure to carry me through a series whose first volume mostly takes place over a single day and barely even hints at the ultimate goal of the overall plot.)  I suppose that the length of time I'm willing to wait for a series is, as yet, undefined. I will not know for sure what the upper limit is until such time as David Gerrold finishes volume 5 of The War Against The Chtorr, which I have been waiting for since 1993 when volume 4 came out. If I don't buy it then I know that I've found my limit."

Fantasy,3e2wni,xland44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:57 2015 UTC,I tend prefer epics. I often find the pacing in trilogies to be a bit rushed for my taste. Even with the best paced trilogies I'd rather stick with a story I enjoy spread out over a decade. I'd certainly prefer having something to look forward to then having something be finished forever after three books. Of course sometimes authors add trilogies onto the series afterwards but these often seen disjointed and decidedly worse than the older series. Of course all of this varies depending on the series and the author.
Fantasy,3e3tfi,p0x0rz,15,Tue Jul 21 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about writing, especially in the beginning. Nothing you put down paper is going to match what you have in your head. Words are imprecise representations of our ideas, representations that we all kind of agree upon as sort of meaning the same thing we all think they do. The problem is, the idea in your head is so much more nuanced than you're ever going to be able to put down on paper, because whatever words you use to describe the thoughts bouncing in your head, those words are going to fall flat.  The trick is to practice, practice, practice so that the difference between what's in your head and what's on the page get closer and closer in similarities. The trouble with this is that in most other creative pursuits, it's easier to see, hear, or taste your progress. the writer's skill progresses at such and intangible rate, over so many thousands and thousands of words that it's frustrating at best. It's also one of the easiest creative pursuits for people to delude themselves that they are doing it well when that's anything but the case. (Yeah, I know I opened myself up for that one.)  As for pitching them to writers, most writers have more ideas than we know what to do with. Ideas are easy. It's all about putting in the time to get the ideas out of our head that's that problem. Remember. Stories aren't just written; they're rewritten.  I say, give yourself permission to try. Give yourself permission to suck for a while. Who knows, you might wind up surprising yourself."

It's easy to look at those of us with ""author"" as our job description and think we have something special that helped us get there, when most of the time what got us here was a mountain of junked manuscripts, rejection letters, and years and years of exasperation and determination.  Those who say ""I can't do it"" never will. But those who say ""who knows, maybe I can"" are on their way. Not everyone will succeed, but you'll never know if you're one of the ones who can unless you give it a try."

The book has so many woah moments (and Words of Radiance is even better) that it would be too bad to give up but...   The series is so venerated in this community that I feel like I'm failing somehow.   Of course not. If you don't like it, you don't like it and that's it. I would advise you to keep reading because I am a total Stormlight Archive fan, but really, there is no shame in giving up a story you're not interested in."
Fantasy,3e219l,Sharadee,6,Tue Jul 21 10:30:39 2015 UTC,To use an analogy; I think I'm trying to tell myself that I'm still in the 'concerning hobbits' phase of the book and that soon the ringwraiths will turn up in the shire and we're off on the adventure.
Fantasy,3e219l,toqueville,4,Tue Jul 21 10:33:45 2015 UTC,Pretty close to how I felt about a fair percentage of that book.  I did get hooked on it though.  Book 2 was much easier.
Fantasy,3e219l,Szeth_Vallano,2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"This is a very accurate way to look at it. I completely ADORE the series, but it took me a good for the first book to really sink its hooks into me. Kaladin's chapters are, as you stated, great from the get go. I really struggled with Shallan though. Stay with her until the last quarter of the book though. She gets really interesting, really fast.   As someone else stated, book 2 is way easier to get into since a large majority of the world building is taken care of."
Fantasy,3e219l,deadlast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right.  The book starts out kinda dull, becomes interesting midway through, and then ends with a huge bang.  The last 15% of the book is probably responsible for 90% of the praise."
Fantasy,3e219l,SirBiest,13,Tue Jul 21 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"I second Sharadee, keep reading. I had similar difficulty getting into way of kings, but it really just keeps getting better and better and Words of Radiance was incredible. Shallan's start is quite boring but she is a lot more interesting in the second book and Kaladin's depression can get a bit tough to get through but thats how depression is I guess :P However, whenever the opportunities arise, Kaladin shows his qualities. Trust me, it's pretty freakin awesome sometimes XD"
Fantasy,3e219l,Final7C,3,Tue Jul 21 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that this seems to be the consensus. While Sanderson is renowned for his worldbuilding and knowing the difference between a safe hand and a free hand is a part of that process it doesn't make for compelling reading.   I guess I was looking for confirmation that, once the framework is set out, the narrative picks up a bit."
Fantasy,3e219l,gdrouill,6,Tue Jul 21 10:42:35 2015 UTC,"Shallan's chapters do seem like an odd and rather boring aside from the awesome Kaladin storyline. But eventually you (or at least I) started to enjoy Shallan's story for it's seeming ease. Because as much as I'd love to hear about Kaladin's badassery I need it to be toned down every so often so I can miss it. And eventually I even started to enjoy her character.   Edit: I should note. Shallan and Kaladin are two different points of view of persistence and growth. Both overcome adversity in different way. You get to see the learned gentry of Shallan and Jasnah, and the brutal harshness of Kalandin's situation. The compliment each other in a clunky way at first and moving to a smoother view later."
Fantasy,3e219l,xolotl92,5,Tue Jul 21 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"Plus, in WoR you get to find out what a hard core badass with a dark past Shallan actually is. She was easily my least favorite character before. Now she's easily my favorite."
Fantasy,3e219l,brova,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:58 2015 UTC,"It definitely does.  I know the first time I read it I felt the same way, especially about Shal chapters, but once you get rolling it really takes off.  Also, the second book doesn't have to build up, as the story is already chugging along, so it's even better than the first."
Fantasy,3e219l,nowonmai666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:54:09 2015 UTC,"I think it took me until like halfway through Way of Kings to really get into it and hooked.  The shit gets turned WAY the fuck up and becomes awesome.  The first book suffered pretty heavily from Brandon writing a lot of the early portions a very long time ago, then rewriting a whole bunch, so the pacing is definitely off.  Luckily, It picks up and really finds its groove. Hope you enjoy it!"
Fantasy,3e219l,monkpunch,12,Tue Jul 21 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't particularly enjoy the book.  I felt that Shallan was nowhere near as witty as she imagines herself to be (and still don't know whether that was intentional or just a sign that Sanderson himself is no Oscar Wilde) and that spoiled her chapters. I also felt she reached a point where telling her story might have been a better idea than executing on her original plan, but there you go.  As for Kaladin, I never found him compelling, in part because his combination of prior experience and accomplishments and subsequent world-weariness was at odds with his youth; it didn't make sense. And his plot seemed to move extremely slowly: it seemed to take pages for him to minor spoiler - such a minor task when I presume he will go on to do much more difficult and important things in the future. It reminds me of the early stages of an RPG when you're killing rats in the basement to earn copper pieces.  The concept of the bridge crews was interesting, and of course any action sequence that Sanderson writes is always thrilling, and the chapters with Dalinar as well as the minor viewpoint character interludes were all excellent and kept me going until the end, but I felt that the book was needlessly long for the amount of stuff that actually happens. Sanderson is at his best when he keeps a plot moving along briskly; he's not the kind of writer whose prose you can savour whilst nothing happens.  My other complaint was that I found it hard to visualise the very alien world in which the book was set. The Shattered Plains were very clear, but the rest of Roshar with its strange lifeforms I found difficult. This is probably at least in part because I too was listening to the audiobook, and I understand the print version is illustrated.  The biggest issue for me was the lack of resolution to the questions raised in the book. When writing a long series it's necessary to provide a steady supply of ""closure"" events. Some questions that are raised will not be answered until the end of the series, but if readers are going to have to wait for years between instalments, you need to drip-feed them some answers. After reading the book, however, I had this exchange with the author which out me at ease somewhat."
Fantasy,3e219l,brova,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:15 2015 UTC,My other complaint was that I found it hard to visualise the very alien world in which the book was set.   I must admit I've had a similar problem. The concept of an ecology that has evolved to survive brutal storms was interesting but the imagery it conjured up for me is very barren world inhabited largely by crustaceans. Kind of like the sea floor.
Fantasy,3e219l,nowonmai666,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way as well.  Like many others I'm sure, I tend to form a picture of the world/environment in my head relatively early on, and despite of Sandersons exhaustive descriptions none of it seemed to form into a cohesive picture for me.  In fact, I had to stop about halfway through and mentally force a picture of what the terrain would be like, after reading about some of the much larger features (like how whole cities had to sit in protected areas) and just how bad the storms were.  I've never had to do that before.  Before that I was just picturing a generic, if relatively desolate part of the world."

I've spent a lot of time advising people in this subreddit that a lot of the complaints they may have read about Wheel of Time are no longer applicable now all the books are available, and I think the same thing will also be true of my reservations about Stormlight Archive."

Fantasy,3e219l,ArgentIV,4,Tue Jul 21 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"I have not started the series yet but I went to a Brandon Sanderson signing at Comic-Con this month, and Brandon told me to stick with the series once I start. That it is a little slow to begin with but that it will pick up and pay off the more I read it. We only talked for 30 seconds, so for him to mention this specifically I felt it was pretty relevant."
Fantasy,3e219l,Final7C,6,Tue Jul 21 17:16:36 2015 UTC,"I think taste is very subjective, meaning just because the series tends to get praised to high heaven, doesn't mean there's something wrong with you for not liking it.   I could never really get in to GRRM stuff, and since I never read the books, I didn't see much point in watching the series either, critical acclaim non-withstanding.  That being said, Way of Kings is awesome (In my opinion)."
Fantasy,3e219l,soberirishman,3,Tue Jul 21 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"The audiobook might be your problem. If it's the same single narrator who did Mistborn I can't imagine how you've handled even 17 chapters of gravel throated monotone worldbuilding, with little to no variation in pace.   Minor rant aside, I understand only identifying with Kaladin at this point, there hasn't been much in the way of introducing us to the world of politics on Roshar. The series has a knack of taking a lot for granted and assuming you'll keep up, with the result that some reveals and actions have less of an emotional heft to them than they should, but if you can manage that, it does get better over time.   I think the second book does a better job of filling out everyone who isn't Kaladin, but I can understand if you can't stick with it till then."
Fantasy,3e219l,lolboogers,3,Tue Jul 21 11:42:01 2015 UTC,"It's done by Kate Reading and Michael Kramer. Whereas Michael Kramer was alone for Mistborn. They generally make a deal to voice specific chapters with Shallan, but occasionally they'll mix it up.   I enjoy Michael Kramer, but I've also heard some god awful narrators in my time."
Fantasy,3e219l,glorkcakes,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"Huh, I actually feel like Michael Kramer is one of the best in the business. To each their own..."
Fantasy,3e219l,SirGrimdark,3,Tue Jul 21 16:47:51 2015 UTC,I didn't like the book at all until ~600 pages in or so. Now it's one of my favorites of all time.
Fantasy,3e219l,Retsam19,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"It is really slow at first, luckily I really enjoyed the characters (especially kaladin and his flashback chapters) so I managed to pull through that part.  However in the last 100-200pages of the book its probably some of the best fantasy I have ever read.  Each chapter brings so much more to the table and drops bombshell after bombshell, and the ending is AMAZING too  I know this is kinda shitty advice but IMO just bear with it and you will not be disappointed"
Fantasy,3e219l,SirGrimdark,4,Tue Jul 21 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"Opinion: I felt the same problems. I powered through, solely so I could be fully aware of the entire work. I still loathe it, and think Sanderson's quality as a writer fell off a cliff (loved the Final Empire, myself). It has some epic, enjoyable moments, but the prelude, and especially the video game manual mechanic explanations of the magic system in the prologue is horrid and self-masturbatory on behalf of Sanderson. Kaladin's angst is so dull and boring, as is Shallan's 'shyness' and 'properness' which turns around and becomes 'tough' and 'inappropriate' when required by the plot for the first book. TBH, you're not failing at all. You're thinking for yourself. I loathe the damn work and its alleged 'universal acclaim', and the fanboys of it who will tear you a part for criticising it. What you like and love derive solely from you, and do not reflect on your worth as a community member."

I've participated in discussions, where upon someone requesting various opinions and responses to a work, I've criticised a particular work. For example, while I enjoyed most of Dune, I called out some flaws that I felt were worth commenting on, and of course, out of the the woodwork comes insults. Similarly, because I disliked Kaladin's (and what I saw as a) jesus arc, I was insulted. It's just a thing that happens. Fanboys exist of all works, wouldn't you agree? Have you never been insulted for offering a differing opinion on r/fantasy?"

Fantasy,3e219l,SirGrimdark,2,Tue Jul 21 11:57:28 2015 UTC,I think the Final Empire was a well crafted post-modern fantasy piece. I really got into the book. I thought it was very intelligent for what it was.
Fantasy,3e219l,_eternalreturn_,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:59:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it was ok. To my point, I think the idea was a good one, but the prose, as always, was clunky, and the dialogue was (as ever) bad.  Not 'Words of Radiance' bad, but not something that a good editor should have let pass. That said, a lot of Stephen King's dialogue is stilted and unreadable, too, and he knows it.  For some reason, the two of them just can't write believable human interaction, but are very good at coming up with interesting ideas."

Fantasy,3e219l,guyonthissite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think it gets better later on in the book/series.  Shallan's chapters are remarkably boring until towards the middle/end of the book at least I found.  Her part does pick up and even more so in the second book.  Adolin is kind of a whiny baby in my opinion but he does get better.  It also gets better when you start to see some of the actual battles.  I also love when it starts to really explain more of the magic as the characters try to learn and grow themselves.  But then again I am also one of the Sanderson fanboys.  I read the book, not an audiobook so I don't know if that has anything to do with it.  It may depend on the quality of the audiobook (one actor doing all the voices or multiple different actors/background effects etc).  I personally like reading better just to use my own imagination.  Also, if you haven't read any Sanderson yet, I definitely would not recommend you start with this behemoth.  I would recommend starting with Warbreaker or his Mistborn Trilogy.  They are much faster to get to the action.  His Stormlight Archive is supposed to rival The Wheel of Time in length so if the first books did disclose all his secrets and felt like they were moving very quickly, I would honestly be more concerned than if I was bored reading some parts of it."

And that was reading the book, so I could skim read and go at my own pace! I can't imagine how it would be listening to the audio, since audiobooks always seem slower than the written version.   But seriously, keep on reading and remember: he is setting up a gigantic story and world that will span on 10 books of over a 1000 pages each! I promise it is worth it, the pace picks up and eventually Kaladin won't seem like the only really interesting character in there. If I remember correctly, I really got into it only past 1/3 of the book (though it's been a few years now so I can't be sure).   I hope you end up enjoying it as much as I do! :)"

On one hand, I was really amazed at the level of detail Sanderson put into his worldbuilding, but on the other hand...it bogged everything down.

The 'twist' at the end had me on the edge of my seat and for the first time I realized that, yes, I do care about these characters!  Of course, you may end up not feeling the same.  Life's too short to read books you're not enjoying, and Way of Kings is a damn long read.

That being said, the farther in you get, the more the story and the characters start to intertwine, and the story as a whole is intricate and entertaining.    It seems like a long lead up, but by the end of the first book, you are on the trail of a good story, so it's definitely worth finishing."

Trust me, the action picks up, but also the details of the world and everything that is going on that will pique your interest.  I think Sanderson did such a good job showing the drudgery of life as a bridgeman that I didn't care very much for it at first.  If you like Kaladin now, you will really enjoy what the future holds."

You will wind up developing all kinds of expectations that may or may not be fulfilled. This is exactly what happened to me with Malazan. It was built waaaaaaay up to me. Then I read it and was thoroughly underwhelmed. On the other hand, I bought Way of Kings knowing basically nothing about it and absolutely loved it. I don't know how to correct the problem besides to just take a few months off and try to forget the hype and try again later (which is what I plan to do for Malazan... eventually... on day... maybe...)."

Don't worry if you are having trouble falling in love with it initially, especially the non-Kaladin chapters. I found myself having that same problem at first. Trust me, the other characters become just as gripping. Shallan (not to mention Jasnah) seriously grow on you, in particular. Like vicious whale barnacles. But lovable, vicious whale barnacles."

Mine were ""Polynia"", ""The 9th Technique"", ""The Rope is the World"", ""The Bastard Prompt"", ""A Second Slice Manifesto"", and ""The Design"".  ""Säcken"" and ""The Rabbet"" were both also memorable for being balls-out scary. Miéville does good horror."

I read most of it, many years ago, and loved it, but it took so long for the series to be completed that I never finished it. I prefer Elliott's books over Forsyth's. Her steampunk novel, Cold Magic (which has a bit more of a YA feel to it), was also a fun read.  I also remember liking J.V. Jones's A Sword of Shadows series and Laura Resnick's Chronicles of Sirkara."

My TBR pile is huge, but I really want to check out what the female authors are doing. I have read a fair few but my reading lately has definitely been male dominated.  Soeone mentioned Forsyth's series as being like WoT, but it's hard to tell. The whole dialect thing will end up annoying me. I gave up on Peter V. Brett because of it (and other things).  What Elliott stuff have you read?"
Fantasy,3e1zrn,lrich1024,2,Tue Jul 21 11:05:52 2015 UTC,"I've only read her Spiritwalker trilogy which was quite good but probably isn't what you're looking for. Some people call it steampunk because there are airships and some other tech (gas lamps and stuff). It has a lot of stuff in it mixed together -- the fae, mages (who are kind of pissed about the rise of tech in the world), trolls, airships, a land that is based on Earth but is like an alt history version of Earth... The thing I loved about it was the friendship/sisterhood between the main protag and her cousin. Because you don't get that a lot in fantasy.  As for Kate's other stuff, her works vary greatly in tone depending on the series from what I understand. If you're on the fence about any of them here's a good write up she did about where to start with her stuff."
Fantasy,3e1zrn,lrich1024,2,Tue Jul 21 11:21:56 2015 UTC,It sounds like a good series. If you like the friendship/sisterhood/family theme then you must read The Invisible Road by Elizabeth Knox (It is an omnibus of Dreamhunter and Dreamquake). Beautiful books and very unique. It's set in New Zealand in the early 1900's. Dreamhunters perform dreams for people in theatres. I higjly recommend it.  Thanks for the link!

We really don't know what the hell the Tears of Edgli are at this point (other than being colorful flowers that just happen to be really useful in a color based magic system), Sanderson is very tight lipped about them (and trust me, I keep asking him about them). All we really know is they aren't Endowment's physical manifestation like most people (including me) thought."
Fantasy,3e2l1e,SageOfTheWise,11,Tue Jul 21 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that Brandon Sanderson's whole writing philosophy can be boiled down to: He Writes Stuff He Thinks Is Cool.  He thought it would be cool to see what would happen if the chosen one failed, if a person had multiple personalities that manifested to help him solve crimes, if a world  had hurricanes of such force they shaped the whole ecosystem, if all his worlds were actually connected. That stuff sounded cool, so he wrote it.  It is fortunate for us that he has the skill and the work ethic to convey these ideas.  It is fortunate for him that so many readers also think this stuff is cool.  I think the Cosmere is really cool."

I am about halfway through the Way of Kings, and am enthralled with the world and story. I had planned on following up immediately with Words of Radiance, but after a cursory search I found that there is a recommendation to begin with Elantris, then Mistborn, and onward.   Words of Radiance is freaking huge in this subreddit and also in all reviews I can find, which makes me want to start it immediately. I do also want to enjoy the entirety of the Cosmere, though, and given that would I be better off going back to the beginning? I don't want to take away from the story, but I feel like my itching to continue the Stormlight Archives prior to any others is clouding my judgment."
Fantasy,3e2l1e,A_stick,4,Tue Jul 21 19:07:27 2015 UTC,You really don't need to read Elantris or Mistborn to enjoy Words of Radiance. Brandon has said before that the books can be read in any order.

Fantasy,3e2l1e,MaxLord,6,Tue Jul 21 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"There's 16 shards, but that doesn't mean 16 series. Mistborn has 2, Stormlight Archive has 3, Elantris and Warbreaker have 3 or 4 between them. We've seen at least half the shards already.  Also the underlying story Sanderson is trying to tell with the Cosmere elements seems to center around Hoid and won't necessarily involve showing every shard beyond the extent to which they'll appear in the Shattering origin story."
Fantasy,3e2l1e,Forest_Green_,3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, good.  I mean, he writes impressively fast but sixteen series seems like more than even he could deal with in his lifetime."

The Mistborn series is almost 700,000 words long (Stormlight is already longer than that). If we were to take Mistborn as a baseline, 16 series would be 11.2 million words.

Fantasy,3e2l1e,OlanValesco,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"Well, in all honesty it's a pretty daunting task. In 16 years Robert Jordan put out 3.3 million. It's taken GRRM 20 years to put out 1.8 million. Steven Erikson did 3.3 million in 12 years (not taking into account the writing date of the first one). Sanderson is currently at about 3.9 million in 11 years, so he's not even halfway on track for reaching 11.2 million in the next 11 years (he'd have to pump out over 7 million)."

Whether you choose Elantris or Warbreaker first really doesn't matter, but if I was going to pick I'd say do Elantris first, then Warbreaker. Get to see the writing style progress over time instead of regress.  Stormlight is awesome, but it's going to be even more awesome when you have all the Cosmere background.   Also you mention having only the 'first' Elantris, but there aren't any others. I guess you are thinking of The Emperor's Soul, which isn't a sequel in really any way.

Fantasy,3e195i,tilfordkage,27,Tue Jul 21 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"I enjoy background wars. The Red Queen and the Lady Blue, Bayaz and Khalul, the various factions in ASoIaF. It adds a depth to the world and makes the characters feel like a small part of a much wider conflict.   I'm starting to dislike epic, end-of-the-world storylines. They can be well done, but I've read enough that the idea of the end of the world is starting to feel really stale. I know the world will be saved because anything else would be a shit ending. Some people might say it's more about the journey, and they have a point, but I'd rather have a great journey and an unpredictable ending. Once the stakes get raised too high, victory for the protagonists becomes a foregone conclusion and I find that the tension in the story actually falls. Not every fantasy series needs to build to some melodramatic, epic battle for the fate of the world."
Fantasy,3e195i,Candidate88766,5,Tue Jul 21 06:39:30 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Ideally, though, the TRUE story is the one strung between the characters. Since the A-story ending is nearly always a foregone conclusion, the real interest, for me, becomes what happens to the characters involved? Which ones survive? Which triumph over their inner demons, and which are consumed by them?"
Fantasy,3e195i,AnotherThroneAway,7,Tue Jul 21 07:52:29 2015 UTC,"Good points, a story is as much about the journey as it is about the destination. You knew that Rand had to win in The Wheel of Time or that Sauron had to be defeated in The Lord of the Rings, but the focus was on how the characters changed over the course of the story.  However, I'd still like to see fantasy stories with a smaller scale because then it becomes possible for the protagonists to fail. The Heroes by Joe Abercrombie is a perfect example: the book tells the story of a three day battle, showing it from the perspective of characters on both sides. Neither side is good or evil, they just happen to be at odds. The story has added excitement because either side could lose, the ending isn't a foregone conclusion."
Fantasy,3e195i,Candidate88766,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:49 2015 UTC,The Lions of al-Rassan by Guy Gavriel Kay is another books which makes it really exiting who wins in the end.
Fantasy,3e195i,LaoBa,22,Tue Jul 21 12:48:37 2015 UTC,"God help me, but I love a good line.  I'm a total sap for good dialogue and there's few things that are as awesome to me as a good one-liner, portentous speech or biting insult.  The line is fine as hell to walk because when someone sounds like they're trying to be badass or witty, it's painful to read.  And this goes double in fantasy books, where a painful line comes with an extra-helping of fantasy cheese.  But when it's done right?  You get gems from authors like Scott Lynch, Rachel Aaron and one of my very favorites from Joe Abercrombie.  Said during a torture scene in which a man's finger is chopped off:  ""Hope you weren't planning on playing the violin.  You'll be lucky if you can play a fucking gong by the time I'm done with you."""

Fantasy,3e195i,starbreakerauthor,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"IMO, this is totally fine as long as something else in the story allows the reader to draw the conclusion that the author knows the character is a pretentious try-hard.  That sounds a bit convoluted. Let me give examples: Either the pretentious try-hard character has moments of ""fuck, I'm a pretentious try-hard,"" or other characters snicker about it behind their hands."

But I consider emotional stakes to be a pretty believable reason to do so.  Withholding information because it might hurt someone you care about, make things more difficult or cause you intense amounts of pain is pretty believable to me."
Fantasy,3e195i,SamSykes,10,Tue Jul 21 07:39:40 2015 UTC,"But at other times (which I think he's getting at) is the Big Misunderstanding, where two grown adults won't clear up a small incident by at least listening to each other.  She walks in on him talking to another girl and immediately storms off, angry that he would cheat on her. They've trusted each other for years, but... how could he do this to her? None of his explanations are good enough, and she cuts him off at every chance because he's so cruel!   It can happen, sure, but this is often the entire plot of many a romance film or story or even subplot. Relationship issues are reduced to one Incident, one Misunderstanding, and everything is thrown into jeopardy by it.   It's annoying for two reasons: 1) a simple, thirty second conversation would clear it up; it's false tension to drudge up a sense of ""drama,"" and 2) relationships are so much more complex and there are so many better, more three-dimensional conflicts to choose from that don't turn the protagonists into angsty preteens."

People forget to tell important things, or refuse to listen, or don't say anything, or misunderstand each other, etc. all the time, and the reasons are often absolute irrational bullshit. Hell, I'm guilty of it myself.    In fiction, though, it often comes off as cheap and lazy. There are thousands of ways for starting a plot, creating conflicts - and things like withholding information for no reason, not talking, not listening to each other...they are, well, easy. Too easy, sometimes.    Like any trope, it can be done well, especially if it's in-character and well justified, but the potential for abuse is enormous."

It is hard to explain why a person randomly goes on a selfless quest like that so often you either need to give them a special role (someone in a position of authority), special skill (someone uniquely competent to do the task) or special destiny (someone who is meant to complete the action). Simply put, the special destiny requires the least effort and gives the most freedom, so it tends to be relied on as a crutch even though its not the best way of achieving character motivation."

Fantasy,3e195i,randomaccount178,4,Tue Jul 21 14:05:13 2015 UTC,"I have been reading and listening to audiobooks a bit too much in the past couple years and have thought about this.  The first thing I hate is love at first sight. I do not really believe in love at first sight, but in fantasy books lust at first sight is what I see. Then the main character falls even more in love for sometimes no reason, while there are plenty more amazing women in the book. I read a book called Emissary this year which had the worst love story I have ever read. I goes from saving a random beautiful girl. To being married with very little in between.  Withholding information from characters to make a plotline is very annoying. I see this is many fantasy books, but let me spoil some of Outlander for you. The father finds out that her daughter was raped, and does not tell the daughter. Daughter was raped by another man after her wedding and tells no one. Her husband comes back after his journey and meets the daughters father first who ends up beating him up and sending him into slavery. The rest of the book is them trying to find him. If a whole plot line could be avoided by talking among main characters that are together I hate it.   Vague prophesies and mysteries in a book can be either bad or good. In the Kingkiller books I want to read more to find out the University and old mysteries and stories, because they are interesting and will add more to the world. I recently started reading the Licanius Trilogy and came up with too many ""you will understand when it comes time"" type statements that were supposed to add mystery to the book, which actually just annoyed me with the frequency."

Fantasy,3e195i,kazmanto,4,Tue Jul 21 21:05:10 2015 UTC,I like it when an author takes a group of seemingly unrelated cast.

I'm not really fan when an old villager or a person who shows up around when the main character did secretly is the character's mother or father.   This is just my personal opinions.

Fantasy,3dzng2,dmoonfire,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"Minor other thing, you have an upload for the cover but don't give dimensions or size that I can see. I just kind of had to scale it down until it worked.  Nice job on handling accents. There are a lot in this book.  I noticed that on my profile screen, my first book (Sand and Blood) shows as ""Rutejìmo #undefined"" even though I put that on the edit page. On the home page, it shows as #1 correctly.  If I go to my profile from the home page, I see my first chapter draft. But if I click the ""summaries"" link, it goes away. The only way I can see the first draft is if I go to home and then back to the profile.  It's sad you don't have ISO dates (2015-07-20). :P"

Fantasy,3dwq0i,morallyharmful,4,Mon Jul 20 12:50:22 2015 UTC,I'm glad to hear that. Maybe I should actually check it out.
Fantasy,3dwq0i,AvalonBright,5,Mon Jul 20 13:17:05 2015 UTC,You definitely should. It feels like the perfect blend of 3e and the parts of 4e that actually worked. My only complaint is the fact Wizards releases less new material than Paizo for it. It's been out for nearly a year and there hasn't been a single new splatbook. If people don't want inundated with the things fine but jesus christ it's getting a bit ridiculous to play for an entire year without a single new class and only a minimum of new options from Unearthed Arcana articles monthly.
Fantasy,3dwq0i,morallyharmful,7,Mon Jul 20 16:11:27 2015 UTC,The optimist in me hopes they are being very careful about what they put out. Just about every tabletop rpg in the past gets bloated at some point. I'm already starting to feel like Paizo is getting to the breaking point with content.
Fantasy,3dwq0i,shadowplanner,5,Mon Jul 20 17:13:48 2015 UTC,"I heard it took things from 3e but went more with a 1st edition feel.   4e sucked ass in my opinion.   Trying to MMOify PnP.  I like the content in 3e, 3.5e, PAthfinder... but my first session usually is absorbed by making characters.  1st edition (and even 2nd) I could make a pretty detailed character in 15 minutes and spend the rest of the session actually playing.   I miss that aspect.   I've heard 5th edition has brought some of that back."
Fantasy,3dwq0i,vampatori,4,Mon Jul 20 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"I came from 2nd basic (red book) and 5th feels very natural to me.  The thing I liked most about 2nd was that there were so few rules, you focus on the role-playing - however it actually had too few, there was no class/race separation, magic users couldn't do much most of the time, there were no ability checks, and so on.  So we ended up homebrewing a lot of rules.  We looked into moving to 3.5/pathfinder/4 but there they had the opposite problem.. far, far too many rules.  There was some sort of rule for everything, which meant looking it all up, and so on.  5th really sits almost perfectly between the two.  There's enough rules so that it's obviously a modern RPG game.  But, there's so few rules that you still focus on the role-playing.  And it's interesting, but most of our homebrew 2nd rules are actually in the game (some slightly different, others spot-on).  It just feels right - it's intuitive.  If I don't know the rule for something I'll just guess, and I'm almost always right (well, as DM I am always right.. but you know what I mean!)."
Fantasy,3dwq0i,deathkraiser,0,Mon Jul 20 19:38:53 2015 UTC,I heard that Wizards doesn't want to put out many (if any) splat books and wants to focus on adventures and settings.  Sounds great to me!
Fantasy,3dwq0i,AvalonBright,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like shit. Who wants to play the same game for the better part of ten years with barely a single actual update? We have DMs, we can make our own damn campaigns."
Fantasy,3dwq0i,deathkraiser,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"Well as I understand, a majority of the complaints about 3.5 and 4th Edition were about the number of splat books that bogged down and broke the game. I guess Wizards wants to try alleviate that.  Honestly I think if a system and DM are both good enough, you could easily play the same game for the better part of 10 years.  DMs can introduce new mechanics as needed for their campaigns."

Fantasy,3dzx97,sindeloke,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:59 2015 UTC,"I think he misses the point on the sexism complaint. I'm not sure anyone has ever just baldly said on reading a book ""this should be less sexist because that society wouldn't be that sexist."" They simply say ""this should be less sexist because sexism is played out, unfun, painful and ubiquitous and I just want to read something that doesn't revel in it for once,"" and then some jackhole responds with ""but it's realistic for the setting!"" And that's when people start saying ""no it isn't even that."" Also a big thing in the universe of incessantly white medieval fiction, where the automatic and universal response is the patently false ""but there only were white people in the real world version."" The defenders of he universe are the ones who bringing the idea up to begin with, and the objectors only address it to dismiss an illegitimate defense against a legitimate complaint, not because they give a damn about ""historic realism"" themselves.  Now, verisimilitude, that matters, and is a hell of a lot easier to create and maintain if you base your work on research about how people and cultures actually function. He's right that that's not absolutely necessary, but you need a fair amount of both talent and luck as a writer to go without. I think probably a fair number of readers don't realize the distinction themselves, either, so probably a lot of the ""realism""-related complaints he sees are really due to an author's failure to establish verisimilitude. After all, if a world doesn't feel real, it's a lot easier to identify and therefore blame a particular odd bit of magical physics than to parse out the nebulous quality of narrative that isn't there to make you willing to overlook it."

Second, you just called anyone making a reasonable point in a debate a 'jackhole' purely because a fact annoys you, not cool.

Off the top of my head:   Unplug your modem for few minutes. Most people get dynamic IPs assigned to them by their ISPs. When you plug it back it, it's very possible that you will get a new IP assigned to you. Even easier, use one of dozens of free or paid VPNs. Even easier than that, use one of dozens of free or paid proxies. Use some onion routing software. Go to the library and vote from there. And vote next time you're at your friend's house. Or your mom's house.   To just say it's not true that people can't vote multiple times is silly, and honestly your tone in a lot of these replies is condescending. It reads like you're using your status as an author to push people around here. Just my 2 cents there.  edit: apparently I have a hard time properly formatting bullet points on reddit."

Each time you have merely pointed out it is not as easy to rig the system as implied, and have gotten blasted for it. They have even waffled between qualifiers, from:   any ip can vote unlimited times, to ok, any network can, to well, if I use a variety of systems to mask my ip, I can.   Finally, when you point out there are protections against that too, there is still blind denial. I mean, anyone can attempt to rig any vote system, even the Hugo (obviously). But no one claims it is rigged simply because it is possible to attempt such actions.  Reddit is odd sometimes."

Fantasy,3dyigr,MarkLawrence,9,Mon Jul 20 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"Mark, I'm basing this on my own experience voting in the Gemmell awards. You may believe otherwise, and you're fully entitled to your opinion, but please believe me when I say with great certainty that it was extremely easy to vote multiple times in the Gemmell awards. I'm not saying many people did this, because I have no idea how widespread it was. I'm not saying it affected the results in any meaningful way, because I have no access to that information. I'm not trying to take away from the achievement of winning the award. However, if you truly believe that it's not possible to vote multiple times in an award that doesn't require any form of registration or vote identifier, you are mistaken. I hope that this vulnerability in the DGA voting process will be resolved in the future, but right now it's there for any 15 year old with rudimentary programming skills to take advantage of."

Are we to understand that your claim to have voted multiple times is based on you using your rudimentary programming skills to cheat?   It is not possible to vote many times without hacking or owning many computers at many different locations. Registering, passwords, and eyeball recognition would not stop people with sufficient determination gaming the system (or any system) either. You can hack government military computers or people's bank accounts. Nobody is going to say you can't hack a public vote.  It is however disingenuous to just say 'oh anyone can vote as many times as they want' or words that give that impression. It's not true.  Finally. Just because you think you voted multiple times does not mean that those votes were registered as legitimate. As I said, the voting software performs all manner of anti-cheating algorithms designed to identify suspicious clusters in time, IP space etc and votes can be and are discarded if deemed suspicious."

You are, however, moving the goal posts from ""It's not possible to vote multiple times"" to ""It's not possible to vote multiple times without hacking.""   For what it's worth (since you seem to enjoy challenging people's reading comprehension) I didn't use the word hacking. In this day and age, anyone can google a workaround, use proxies, mask IPs and so on and so forth. That's hardly ""hacking"". It's cheating, sure, and I don't condone it in any way, but it doesn't require much in the way of programming skills. For an award that requires no registration of any kind and with an extensive open voting period, it's simply too easy.   It's only a matter of time before someone does this, just like it was only a matter of time for someone to exploit the weakness in the Hugo system by creating a slate.   At that point, I hope the administrators of the DGA will take the sensible precaution of requiring some form of registration. I don't think a membership and PIN number is required, like for the Hugos, but at least requiring a name and/or email address would be a good idea, don't you think?

You moved the goalposts.  You said one can vote multiple times. You didn't qualify that. You just said it. The only reasonable interpretation of that is that anyone can easily vote many times.

Based on your wording, you seem to imply that simply because the voting system leaves room for manipulation, there is no way that the number of votes recorded can be realistic.

A person can run 100m in under 9.6 seconds.  Saying ""A person can vote in the Gemmell Awards as many times as he/she wants."" implies that the poll allows that. It implies that if someone clicks onto the site and reaches the 'vote' button they can click it as many times as they like and vote as many times as they like. It's deliberately misleading. It's easy to see that it's deliberately misleading.   So I can understand why you'd want to believe these awards are somehow ""superior"" to others.   I won't say that's beneath you, but it's beneath most people. Yuck it up if you like.  Unless you know what the anti-cheat software the pollsters employ then you have zero idea how easily gamed a system it is. I won't speculate on why you would wish to believe it easy rather than hard.

And furthermore I could vote 60 times from my workplace alone without switching IPs. I didn't, but I could have.  As much as I'm a fan of the free for all fans approach, if they want to be taken seriously, this needs to change. There needs to be some kind of entry barrier."

Here is the warning EasyPolls gives you when you turn on the stricter anti-cheat options:  Warning: When using advanced anti-cheat algorithms, there is a chance that genuine answers are considered cheating. The system uses an advanced calculation based on geographic location, client information, and other elements to calculate whether it is likely that a response is a cheat. If respondents are located mostly within the same sub-net (for example same company or university network) it might appear to Easypolls that they have the same IP address. If so, genuine respondents might be considered to be cheaters."

Rather than appealing to a small base of ""true fans"" in his blog post (link because it's hard to find in the Guardian article) I would say it seems more like he's throwing the term back at the Hugo complainers/Puppies/conservatives. The results of the Hugos opening up to a wider audience of fans will prove definitively (so GRRM hopes) that their side is not in the majority among a larger (but no less 'true') audience either."

I had no idea that this was just the award from a science fiction convention voted on by the fans that attend the convention.  It explains a lot of the confusion I felt over the years over a lot of choices, some writers are heavily in to that scene and others are not."

You can't fault them saying the Hugo represents the entire community when you understand the motive behind it. If you're the voice of the people, you can enforce your standards unto what is allowed to be said, and by necessity what can't be said. Every group has the same problem, from feminists, to libertarians, conservatives and democrats alike. The Irene Gallo situation is a prime example, she said some horrendous things and when she got called out for it, the forces got out in masse to defend her and thus shape the message around the situation into it being a blatant attack on Gallo for being a woman. Your own Tor.com review is also an example, though it kinda backfired.  I disagree on some things with Correia, but you have got to give it to him, the man has balls."

I understand how it's a validation for the authors. Which is great but I think they should just change the hugos to be voted only by published authors and editors therefor it becomes an award given to authors by their peers. I am sure there is already an award that is this but for whatever reason hugos are the most predominant award so keeping it as a quasi people's choice award seems weird. The real people's choice award is the best sellers list anyway. It even comes with a cash prize."

Everyone knew that if a group of 10-15% (about 150-300 people this year) decided to all vote for the exact same slate, things would go bad. However, before the puppies no one was willing to do such a thing, because the people who normally vote and nominate for the Hugos actually care about it.   If your talking broken as in 'being controlled by the clique' well the puppies never actually showed anything of the sort. They sad something, but never cared to back it up with anything as simple as evidence.    And exactly how are the authors who got voted in supposed to feel about GRRM basically calling them ""the weakest slate ever""? You're not exactly churning out quality work yourself lately, George.   And how are the authors of the last 10-30 (depends on who and when they are talking) years of the Hugos supposed to feel about being told they only won because they wrote the right message, or because of affirmative action. Don't pretend that the puppies did not start that kinda talk.   And if you have actually read all the works on the ballot this year, you see he has a point.

It's perfectly legitimate to organize and publish a slate of works one thinks are worthy of the award.

Please vote for who you think deserves it the most (but who am I kidding, vote for me because you're already a fan and this post was only intended to make you aware that you could vote for me).""

Heck the man even said that he published a list for your consideration every year...  Do you think the work is hugo worthy? Vote for it (or don't, i'm not)   Call me an SJW, but GRRM has been making a lot of sense in this debate.

To many self promotion is also considered bad and something that should not be done.   However, the there is a difference between what the sad puppies did and what others (like Scalzi has he seems to be the main target of the puppies) do. Self promotion is asking fans who liked something to vote for it. It can range from what Corriea did in 2013, which comes down to asking people to vote for a work because the author wants an award, to what Scalzi does which is to remind people of what of his works are eligible.   Slate voting is different because it is asking the same group of people to all vote the same way, for many works. Its the volume that is different. Self promotion will never (well unless you have a very busy author) take over a category, like slate voting did this year.   What the puppies did was the worse kinda of slate voting. Because it was not based around what one person liked. It was based around a group of people that gathered on a political idea (that the Hugos are shit because of leftists and sjws). And it was put together by a group of people (or one person who did not read what he put on his slate, depending on who you believe)  not as a show case of the best works of the year, but as a movement to 'show the establishment'.

So each of Martins books count as an individual novel.   He also has not won a hugo for asoiaf. Been nominated a few times, the last three of the top of my head. He has won hugos for his short fiction however.   Those Hugo winners however are the best of the year. As decided by worldcon, the con that invented, runs and decides the award. You might not agree, but 'best book' is such a subjective thing. Thats why there are like 50 thousand speculative fiction awards. Each one given out by different people with different tastes and voting around different criteria.   The only thing a Hugo winner has to (and should be) is something that worldcon enjoyed."

Fantasy,3dyrtg,tuf-havilandtuf,6,Mon Jul 20 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"Seems a one-dimensional taken on the trope, with an emphasis on the specialness or glory of the One while neglecting the flip side.   The One is usually cursed, isolated, orphaned and having a destiny is pretty much an excuse to pile more misery, drama & loss upon the character. The trope becomes a necessity in narratives with lone protagonists who have to consequently withstand a disproportional amount of the conflict needed to drive the story forward. Fate and prophecies come into play when practical survivability no longer makes sense."

However, research shows that black people in the US associate with white protaganists as easily as white people do, suggesting that people's attitudes are more to do with conditioning than any sort of inbuilt racism.   On that note, I think the increased social awareness that is currently pervading fantasy writing is doing great things."
Fantasy,3dyrtg,ThrowbackPie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"Actually I don't think its economics. It's the fact that without producing media that actively has protagonists of other ethnicities or gender you can't then say that white men protagonists sell more. Cause you're not even producing things to check that very statement. Then, when you do produce work you often see the industry cite that work as an outlier or not representative of a true demographic. Also, to then try and state that black people for example can associate with a white protagonist easily is not an excuse to not produce work that is representative of other groups because they still want to see themselves reflected in media. You can see it for example in the out pouring of support that people have for superheroes like Kamala Khan and Miles Morales. People do want diversity(or most do) and unless we create work to actively see if it's more economically viable then all you're doing is creating an audience that have just accepted the status quo rather than actively buying into on their own."

He has some humanistic leanings, but thinks that deadly peril is the best way to motivate people to progress.  When the rest of the gods become worried that creation is going to rebel against them, they delegate the destruction of the world to Acerbus.

I’ve made good progress on the setting, which is going to be awesome. I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the teen series I do once the Reckoners and the Rithmatist are both done.

I think he said it was an unimportant planet in the Cosmere, so he might not revisit it :(  A Crown for Cold Silver, hmm. The sheer amount of hype has made me a bit wary.

Fantasy,3dy61d,crowqueen,7,Mon Jul 20 16:54:27 2015 UTC,"I liked A Natural History of Dragons. It did have a different sort of tone to it though, since it was written in the form of a memoir. Also, I really need to read the Temeraire series."
Fantasy,3dy61d,lrich1024,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"I found that ANHOD didn't really hang together for me - and the memoir style meant the author couldn't get deeper into the characters and the whole thing felt very much like the author was too into the pastiche and forgot characterisation had moved on since 1913 - so the Eastern Europeans came off as dehumanised stereotypes, which I couldn't really forgive despite the memoir style. There were some odd worldbuilding choices as well (I mean, the Jewish references were just ...bizarre, particularly because the whole set-up was emphatically not built around a Jewish idiom at all).  On the whole, I think Marie Brennan could have made some better choices."
Fantasy,3dy61d,crowqueen,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was perfect by any means, but I still enjoyed it overall. I agree about not being able to get deeper into the characters. If it had one major shortcoming for me it was that (especially as a reader that loves to connect to characters). The only one we really got to know was Lady Trent. But I put it down to the style in which it was written (as a memoir).  I'd also argue that certain things were deliberate on the author's part (ex: the Eastern Europeans were viewed through Lady Trent's eyes as a young girl and several times in the book Lady Trent said things like 'when I was young and didn't know any better' as if to excuse how she portrayed certain elements....)   On the whole, I think Marie Brennan could have made some better choices.   Perhaps. I still want to read the next one (eventually) because I'm really curious as to how she becomes Lady Trent after everything that happened in the first book."
Fantasy,3dy61d,lrich1024,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure :). I can see that. I tend to be a bit Doylist when I read - if I'm jerked out of the story or didn't enjoy a book, I'm a lot less inclined to look at it through the lens of the story and more likely to look at it objectively.  As someone who has travelled a lot in Eastern Europe and writes stories in a similar setting, and pays attention to setting authenticity, not falling into stereotypes and looking at how I portray other people and classes with respect and dignity, I thought it was a let down and she could have done a lot more with it. The mangled EE language was something pretty much objectively poorly researched, for instance, something independent of the perspective.   It felt as if it was lazy stereotyping - the memoir aspect was fine, but I think she owed the setting a lot more, and modern books shouldn't really be playing those kind of tropes straight. It made me sceptical about whether she could really handle that perspective and give the characters the dignity they really deserved, or whether she was just doing something clueless. And the Jewish bits - the sitting shiva etc - didn't fit at all and I almost flung my Kindle against the wall because of the unwillingness to do some basically seamless worldbuilding on that score. Some of it can be explained away by Isabella's perspective but I found myself cringing at most of it. Because the next books in the series deal with non-European cultures, I'm not sure whether I want to read them given the first book - because her treatment of eastern Europe was so hamfisted, and presumably Isabella doesn't get any more of a sensitive narrator.  Plus the main character got herself into stupid scrapes and the author was always there to bail her out. There was no way Isabella should have been doing what she was doing and again I think that was the fault of Brennan's premise and perspective. It felt like she'd had the wizard idea for the first half, which was a good idea, and then got increasingly constricted because the adventure story she wanted to tell in the second half - to give her the benefit of the doubt - couldn't be done with any sensitivity and Isabella was too young and too much in the straitjacket of patriarchy to have any agency of her own without just coming across as stupidly reckless. Making her a little bit older and a little bit less restricted by her gender would probably have made more sense.   Sorry to lay into the book. It was so promising and yet fell so flat. I know what you're saying about the memoir bits...I just think playing Ruritania (or any other cultural stereotype) straight doesn't really work very well any more."
Fantasy,3dy61d,crowqueen,3,Mon Jul 20 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry to lay into the book.   No need to apologize. You came into reading it with a totally different perspective than I did (what with your experiences in Eastern Europe and all), so of course you'd pick up on things that maybe don't bother other readers as much.   You bring up some good points. I didn't really pay much attention to the religious stuff in the books at all, tbh, as they seemed rather...forced? So, I mainly skimmed those parts.   The character of Isabella was headstrong and she didn't think and got herself into all kinds of messes, but again I put that down to the stupidity of youth (which I think was also acknowledged in the book). And it's not as if it didn't have some consequences. spoiler   I know what you're saying about cultural stereotypes, but again, I totally think the author was aware of it. Whether that's a good or bad thing in this case I guess is a matter of perspective. I took it as this is obviously some kind of time period in her world which would line up with our historical period of anywhere from the late 1700's the mid 1800's? So, it didn't seem totally inappropriate that it somewhat reflected cultural attitudes of the time rather than our modern sensibilities. If that makes sense. (But, I get what you mean and why it would be a turn off. And perhaps I am giving the author too much credit in this instance...)"
Fantasy,3dy61d,lrich1024,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:16 2015 UTC,"No, you're fine - it's nice to discuss and I'm sorry about the rant. I can take a bad book on the chin and move on, but it's the disappointing books which make me really upset.  Regarding the stereotyped plot: it's always a fine balance. If you play it too straight, you do get into unreconstructed territory. If you play it too modern, you get into the territory of whitewashing the attitudes or anachronistic/politically correct history. While I write third person limited, which is a subjective viewpoint, that's largely why I do prefer to give perspectives to a variety of characters so I avoid objectification. I think this is what Brennan wanted to achieve - because her character is a woman, and that's still a relatively 'minority' viewpoint in fantasy fiction - but when dealing with the peasants, it's hard to tell what is part of the story and what is a problem with the writing.   I do think the first half was better than the latter half. The scenes with Izzy and Jacob at home were really well-crafted: the argument over going on the trip in the first place was well handled because Izzy did keep her cool and didn't just throw a tantrum until she got her own way; it felt like a richly human compromise between both partners and that is where Brennan should get credit - maybe that's the side she should focus on (although I guess writers do want to try to spread their wings a bit - I've spent nine months tangling with the adventure genre and couldn't help myself adding in a political strand to the story, because straight adventure just feels cliche to me. I quite like the results because I've ended up with something that feels like Jurassic Park - the humans are battling both external and internal monsters). firstpart!Isabella seemed like a different person to the character in the second half of the book. I've heard someone critique a book before and say that they could see the joins where one part was subject to extensive revision and one part read more like an earlier draft, and the seam moment for me was when they left on the journey: I had very little problem with the first half, it was the second half that annoyed me much more.  That's a good point about the consequences for spoiler!. Also, kudos for her setting gaslamp fantasy in a constructed world. I'd like to see more of that too.  Now...have you ever read Anno Dracula? That's a brilliant, brilliant gaslamp fantasy book. Shame it wasn't a trilogy (well, it is in a way but the subsequent books are set in different time periods rather than being one single story arc to do with the Victorian period), but it's probably the best example of the gaslamp genre."
Fantasy,3dy61d,crowqueen,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:21 2015 UTC,"it's the disappointing books which make me really upset   Oh, I feel ya. It's always when you have expectations that it's worse. (I try really hard not to get excited about books and movies anymore, but it's hard...lol.)   It's always a fine balance.   Yeah, I agree.    it's hard to tell what is part of the story and what is a problem with the writing   And like I said, not sure if it was deliberate on her part or not, but I am going to give the benefit of the doubt for now.  I really loved that scene between her and Jacob as well, for the same reason. It would have been really easy to go the 'character throws a fit' route, but she didn't and I have to respect her for that.   It's actually a nice example of a man getting fridged :D.   Hah.

Did nothing even slightly wrong, and whenever he had to make a hard decision, something would happen to make it easy. Not to mention how the book mentions that the elves are sorto racist to the goblins, but that isn't really a problem for him.   Edit: Not that I didn't like the book.

He does realize it and he feels bad, but they are faults nonetheless that he works on overcoming throughout the book. So he's not really a perfect person.  And the whole thing about the Elves being racist to the Goblins...it's all sort of hinted at and more than anything I came away with the impression that some Elves felt Goblins were ugly more than anything else.

Not just because of it being character driven like /u/MikeOfThePalace noted, but also because it was so.... There was a lot of goodness in it. Where it would have been easy to take the cynical approach with a lot of the 'issues' that were covered in the story, it was never really approached that way. It wasn't 'well, the world sucks, there are hateful people, there are parts of society that are not treated equally, oh well, can't really do shit about it' it was decidedly hopeful. It was, 'hey, wait, there are a lot of good people after all. And even if we don't agree on everything we can still work together to solve problems without being jerks to each other.

Fantasy,3dy61d,Lord_Frost,20,Mon Jul 20 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"The Craft Sequence, mofos. Gladstone turns so many of his themes and cultural critiques into actionable parts of the world. The characters don't just have themes: craft and souls are literal currency, and corporate mergers are literal bloodletting rituals. In Three Parts Dead, the crisis of faith isn't the old stock fallen priest gimmick, it's because for the first time in his life a character's prayers haven't been answered. When his characters have that ""do you believe in God?"" chat that is an annoying trope in so much SF, it's because everything they're about to discuss literally affects the choices they're about to make in dealing with SPOILERS.  Gladstone is taking advantage of Fantasy's ability to create any world you like, and change any rule of our world you like, to far more deeply immerse characters in thematic narrative than most books steeped in historicism and pseudo-realism can. He's making the most of his Secondary Worlds."
Fantasy,3dy61d,JohnLenn0n,4,Mon Jul 20 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Just finished Last First Snow a couple days ago and I fully agree with you.  Your second paragraph is spot on.  I think the books are technically urban fantasy, but they are so far removed from The Dresden Files and such that you think of that the term does not really qualify.

Enough Noble Savages. Give them physical traits, sure. Tusks, green/brown/black skin, tall, short, pig-like aspects, whatever but let them be interesting characters beyond the one or two exceptions. Even if you make them all still very tribal-based, that doesn't mean they're going to lack cunning or just be hate-filled towards each other all the time.

There is always a wind blowing, touching peoples lives briefly, and then continuing. Like from The Eye of the World;  “The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, and Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning, there are neither Beginnings nor endings to the turning of The Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.”  Love it."

That was where I went whenever real life was too hard or too inflexible.""   The age stuff really got to me. As someone in their late thirties wondering...is my youth leaving me? Am I getting old? I don't feel old (except sometimes when I get random aches). It was just good to know that everyone kind of feels that way when they get older.

Yesterday I rode the merry go round with my godchild. Something I haven't done for something like 20 years.  The sounds of laughter and the popcorn smells from the fair, a squeaking, laughing, waving kid next to me, proudly, seriously grabbing its ears while riding her camel and me on my elephant, obviously adulting all over the place, outstanders slightly blurred by the motion, sun hitting your eyes every few seconds, big grin on  our faces.

Fans of what will love it?  Second - you're trapped on a deserted island with three books. Knowing you'll be reading them over and over and over again, what three do you bring?"
Fantasy,3dxp0x,MikeOfThePalace,4,Mon Jul 20 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"My first book is called The Liberation of Sundrian City - and I'd say fans of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. That one specifically because it has the most action, I reckon. In my first book, Linus, 13, finds out the hard way that he is a gifted war-elephant rider. This makes him overnight go from a regular kid to an extremely powerful weapon. He then has to work out where exactly to use that power - with the rebels trying to free their city, or the army, trying to protect it. The whole book is a bit of an allegory on whether it's better to live a safe life but in ignorance, or to know the truth, even if it is dangerous. It's made interesting by the fact that Linus is 13, and at 13, most boys are a bit torn between boyhood and manhood, and it's probably, in my opinion at least, the most tumultuous year of your life.   My second book is called A Duet for Swans, and geek magazine said it was ""Like reading a Miyazaki film,"" and I'd agree with that. It's book one in a trilogy, and in it a young sorcerer travels across the land in a flying tugboat looking for the ocean. It is told from the perspective of the girl Grace who wouldn't let him make the journey alone. Alex is feeling his power growing stronger, and fears that if he doesn't find a mentor, his power might become too strong to contain. His non-magical mentor sends him on an errand to complete during his trip to the ocean - to visit the evil Witch Shakti on the Black Mountain. Reading level, I would say fans of Spirited Away - meaning I've had 8-year-olds read it and 80-year-olds and they love it just the same.   I'm trapped on an island. I'm taking Golem XIV by Stansilaw Lem, Harry Potter (the whole series, if it's all the same to you...), and IT by Stephen King, cos I'm currently halfway thru it, it's long (good rereadability) and it's awesome."

Fantasy,3dxp0x,tomolly,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I am not much of an illustrator though. The artwork from my first book, including that big banner picture on my website with the elephants charging each other, is done by Jimmy Manton, another Melbourne dude. I went to high school with Jimmy, and even back in those days when we were just kids, the guy could draw. I'd be sitting next to him squiggling stick figures in class, and I'd look over and he's just doodled a photo-like giant rhino being ridden through a dust storm into war or something. And then 10 years later, trying to track him down to get him to do the cover for my book, I learned that he wasn't even an illustrator by trade, he's an architect! Had to hound him for weeks to make him agree to draw my cover!  I love collaborating, and with a novel there really isn't that much collaborating to be done. But I think of it like, I'm making this item, a book, and I want it to be the very best I can get it, so I gather up a team of people to work on each element. The typography is always done separately from the image too, because that's a whole different art form. (On that, one advice I tell a lot of indie writers, if you are going to spend money on cover art, and have a limited budget, spend it on typography, not on an illustration. It's more important, and a crappy image with good custom type looks more professional than the other way round.)"

My fav board game: The Game of Thrones board game. I played this pretty solid for a year when I lived down in Tasmania (2013), but now I'm home in Melbourne and have no one to play it with. Such an epic game.  Fav sport: Probably tennis. I don't really play or watch much sport, but I do like watching tennis and playing it. I like rally cars too, when they race.   Superpower: I'd probably say being a jumper (like the film jumper) or telekinetic like in the film chronicle (including being able to fly). I really love the bit in that film where he goes to his dad (possibly step-dad, can't remember), ""I could crush you!"" and throws him against the wall. So good."

Fantasy,3dxp0x,starbreakerauthor,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, actually I don't really know. I'm not much of a genre man, to be honest. I'm reading IT right now and horror doesn't interest me in the slightest, but I'm reading it because it is more than just a horror book - it's an Epic, it's a whole town's history, and it's kind of a masterpiece! That's what interests me, different works of great art. Not so much genres, really. I loved Harry Potter, His Dark Materials, A Trio for Lute - but fantasy isn't one of my favourite genres either. I read more sci-fi than fantasy, even though I write fantasy novels.  Err... tough question, I don't think I really answered it at all!"

Fantasy,3dxp0x,WovenMythsAuthor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:44 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool! Are you an Aussie? Roadbumps... I think persistence is key, especially if you're an indie author. Making a cool book isn't all it takes, you really need to stand behind it for a long time before it gets off the ground. It's not easy to do the overnight success thing, but if you stick to it long enough, you can slowly build an audience. Kind of like being a garage band, you gotta go and do the legwork yourself!"
Fantasy,3dxp0x,swish22,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:05 2015 UTC,"I am indeed haha. Aspiring author like so many of us peon's :)   I've recently become really interested in the  phenomenon of Australian cultural cringe. It seems like many Australian's are unwilling to help support many of our creative industries, for a myriad of weird and depressing reasons. It feels as though you have to ""make it"" out out of Australia, before anyone see's your work as credible. It feels like an extension of the tall-poppy syndrome to is unfortunately lodged into our culture.  Next time I have cashola I will pick one of your things up :)"
Fantasy,3dxp0x,swish22,2,Tue Jul 21 06:45:06 2015 UTC,"Oh man, yeah don't even get me started bout that! I don't like to go on about that really, because I'm aware that I've sold a few thousand  books to aussies who are very supportive of indie artists, and who get right behind what we're doing. But yeah, the problem with especially Melbourne is that everyone is an artist, and yet most of them never do any damn art. And when you tell them you have a book out all they say is ""Oh, yeah, I'm working on a book too.""   The shops aren't much better. Getting my book in stores was the flip of what I expected - indie book sellers and pop-culture stores were either completely dismissive or kind of took it as a favour but didn't really get behind it at all. One popular pop-culture store (cough Minotaur on Elizabeth St end cough) straight up said to me when I took my book in to ask if they'd stock it, ""We don't believe in indie authors"". To which I promptly replied ""I definitely exist, I'm standing right here!"" They have a fricken 50 meter long bookshelf of sci-fi/fantasy, but won't get behind an author from their own city, making waves in the genre that the claim to be such fans of... But major book chains got right behind my stuff, promoted it in store, put it on shelves in multiple shops, put it on their blogs, etc. I guess the small indie shops can't afford to take a chance on something that might not sell, so they just call up their book distributor and say, ""30 copies of Hunger Games, 30 copies of Twilight, better make it 80 of 50 Shades...""   Errr... end rant."
Fantasy,3dxp0x,matilda93,2,Tue Jul 21 08:03:13 2015 UTC,"Oh no don't stop I love it! Hahaha. That sounds really bizarre, but I guess not completely unexpected when you flip it that way! I am a dancer as well, and once when I went into a shop looking for costumes, that they won't stock any Australian indie brands. It was a bit disheartening. The response they gave you must have been pretty shocking however.  I published a novelette last year, then proceeded to not tell anyone about it because I was afraid of backlash like that haha. I have become more thick-skinned since then however. You have inspired me to head to all the fantasy bookshops in Sydney and ask if they stock Australian artists! I know that in Brisbane, Pulp Fiction near Central station are big supporters of local talent :)  Of course, there are some absolutely amazing people out there supporting independent artists, but it unfortunately feels like a black-and-white scenario: unless you are actively supporting Australian a creatives, you are actively not supporting. It doesn't help with these recent Reclaim Australia shenanigans tying themselves so close to ""Australian Identity"", blergh. It makes sense why people want to shy away from our culture when crap like that is dragged up.  I saw on your website that you were at the Melbourne Ozcomicon.

Fantasy,3dxp0x,sevendeadlypings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's tough for us indies. I went to a meeting right, get this, and it was about how to get published. And it was held by publishing industry professionals. And they said that the first step these days is to be an indie author and make a name for yourself, then you can more easily get a traditional publisher. Then when you ask them how does one successfully be an indie author they just sort of mutter something about social media and shrug and change the subject. They don't know! And that's completely fair enough, cos why would they know? They are traditional publishers! But if they are saying to be indie authors, and the indie bookshops won't stock indie books, and the papers and mags and mainstream media won't review an indie book... then what can we do? We either do the legwork, or we go digital and sell our books to Americans! And watch and see, once you get an American audience, suddenly they wanna know all about you. It honestly, they only way I can understand it, is that they don't trust their own judgment on stuff. They don't know what's good, they just know what other people think is good. Even if you do get traditionally published, they aren't looking for the Next Big Thing, they are looking for their version of the current Big Thing. They don't trust themselves to go ""This new thing here is gonna be HUGE!"" The most faith they can stock in their opinions is ""Wow, this was reminiscent of that other thing that was popular!"" Our inability to read something and go ""Heh, I liked that!"" without relying on popular opinion to guide our opinion is turning literature into utter trash.   My advice: stick to your guns. Write what you think is important. Someone, eventually, will come up to you and go ""Wow, I really got that! Thank you for writing what you wrote, it meant a lot to me!"", and it'll be worth a hell of a lot to ya!   But hey, I'm no best-seller.   Oh, and I probably won't be at that con, but I will be at one in Sydney soon. Supanova, Anime thingy, or Ozcc. Follow my FB probably is the best way to see where I'll be."

I've read a fair bit of ""serious literature"" for school,  but that's the only one I enjoyed enough to reread purely for fun.  It's a bit of a tough one to describe; it takes place following two different families over a few generations, it's sort of a analysis/retelling of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel, and has some interesting insights into good, evil, and human nature.  (I did also reread Crime and Punishment... but more because I was interested in it philosophically than because I enjoyed the experience of reading it)"

Fantasy,3dzf8l,CowDefenestrator,6,Tue Jul 21 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. Time to shine. Once every year or so I pick one of the big names and read as much of their shit as I can stand. Just because I want to know what the fuss is all about.  Your examples I've read. Big fan of Count. In that vein I also read Don Quijote and Les Mis. Both alright but do they ever drag. As does Moby Dick. Liked reading Gulliver, Musketeers and Crusoe. More adventure to keep my attention. Same with Huck Finn and the like.  Read about half of Shakespeare's works over the years. Many I didn't care for (those various King named books) but a big fan of Midsummer Night's Dream, Hamlet and Tempest. Also MacBeth way back when in school. Never felt the need to re-read it, but it was one of the more enjoyable mandatory reading experiences.  From the classical period, I've read the Iliad and Odyssey both in 'original' if translated versions as in modernizations. I've read some of Plutarch's accounts. I've read a few of Caesars books. Specifically Bello Gallico and his treatise on the Civil War. Can only rec all of that, especially Caesars accounts. A real life source talking to you from 2000 years ago. Incredibly fascinating, if obviously biased, read if you keep that in mind. The Civil War account is pretty much Game of Thrones with Romans.  I've read the Dystopian Triumvirate, Fahrenheit, 1984 and Brave New World. All good, though I like BNW the most out of the three.  Jane Austen's books were a thing I once really forced myself to read. It's alright, but I wouldn't exactly recommend it. Liked it well enough overall but I'll probably never touch them again.  Read Tolstoi. If you want historical epic, you can't go wrong here. Sometimes tedious, but I liked it overall. The scope makes his books.  My favourite ever 'classic' author would be Kafka. His shorts have this wicked, twisted, experimental feel to them. As do his books, but there aren't many of those. I think I've read everything he's ever written prose-wise. (Don't care for correspondence.) I liked him because I could only take him in small doses, but one of the few authors that made me think after consumption and re-read after.  Don't know how much of it counts as classic, but being German I've read all of Günther Grass. And it's good, weird reading if you want to read literature level prose with Nazis in it. No idea of the translated quality, but his prose is top notch if dry.  Again, as a German, I've had to and sometimes by my own free will, read Goethe. Faust 1+2 is pretty fun for all the wrong/ right reasons. Sorrows of Young Werther is bullshit emo bullshit for emos.  In a more Fantasy vein, everyone should read Lovecraft and Poe. I did, and don't much care for Poe, with notable exceptions like 'The Masque of the Red Death'. (That story is gorgeuosly morbid. Bit in your face with its message, but I loved it.) Still, hugely influential. If you're interested in the roots of the genre, even if it's more Horror than plain Fantasy, you need to read Poe.  In the same vein, if you're interested in the genres roots, read Schillers The Ghost Seer. Necromancy in the 1700s. (He also wrote a version of Jeanne D'arc which I liked very much.)   In the same vein, everyone should give Chaucers Canterbury Tales a go. It's basically an anthology without a theme. The genres switch with every tale.  Burroughs and Howard are well worth a read for similar reasons. You need to be able to put up with cheese and tropey tropes. Just because something is tropey though, doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Barsoom is entertaining as shit. B-movie/ Flash Gordon like fun. Same for Conan.  There are more, but I'll stop now. Honestly, while I didn't like all, I found something to like in most any classic I attempted. They're classics for a reason. With one exception...  Fucking Ulysses. Maybe I need to be Irish or something, but that thing gave me nothing at all. I've read the different reading approach recs, don't bother trying to help, that tome will remain a secret to me. And that's fine."

He writes short stories and Ficciones is a mind-blowing collection that has had a great impact on me as a reader, I wish everyone would read it.

It inspired me to write industrial age fantasy (alongside Crime and Punishment - which interested me in the urban genre - just add magic and put it in a blender) but also because it was literally unputdownable: I read it under the desk in Chemistry class :D.

They end up saving the day, but Nathaniel is blatantly only doing it for revenge, and Bartimaeus is a demon who would just as soon kill the main character as help him.    Also, I feel that most people complain about the Nathaniel chapters, but I think the Nathaniel chapters are well-written, have a interesting story... but just don't have the funny narrator that the Bartimaeus chapters do.  It's a case where the problem isn't that the Nathaniel chapters weren't written badly, but that the Bartimaeus chapters were just written too well."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,kzielinski,11,Mon Jul 20 04:38:07 2015 UTC,"I heard an interesting point about the Snitch and the history of Quidditch that makes it make sense in universe (though out of universe, clearly Rowling just built a sport around Harry being the hero.)  In book 1, Harry's Nimbus 2000 is top of the line. By book 2, the Nimbus 2001 takes the crown. And by book 3, the Firebolt blows that one out of the water. Huge improvements in broomstick speed in a short time, making the Seeker's job much easier - and necessarily, making matches shorter.  Go back in time a few centuries to when Quidditch was being developed. The Snitch would have been just as fast ... but brooms would have been much slower. If you think about it, suddenly the talk of weeks long matches with much bigger point differentials makes more sense. The game was outstripped by the equipment."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,MikeOfThePalace,5,Mon Jul 20 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. The Quidditch history book actually clears a lot of this up, whether it's all contrived or backpedaling or what. The original Quidditch matches were just in random fields and the Snitch was an actual bird. People would fly around in forests and stuff just to find it.  The points also make sense in the frame of a season. They mention that in GoF at the world cup. If a team knows they're losing, they'd rather lose by as little as possible so they won't be so far behind in the season as a whole."

You're right though. It's almost like how Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings as a vehicle for his invented languages, Sanderson seems to write books as a vehicle for his invented magic systems."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,complex_reduction,10,Mon Jul 20 04:16:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree, honestly.  I really think Sanderson is more interested in writing characters first, magic systems second, despite how he's always talked about and recommended as the ""magic systems guy"".    Magic plays the biggest role in Mistborn out of any of his books... but even then I think it was secondary to the characters.  Allomancy was cool, but I don't think it's really what makes or breaks the book for anyone.  Either you find Vin and Elend and Kelsier interesting characters or you don't.    Look at Way of Kings, for another.  It's often considered Sanderson's ""magnus opus"" (so far at least), and yet there's really very little magic going on.  There's a bit at the beginning and the end, but very little throughout the rest of the book."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,forknox,49,Mon Jul 20 06:30:37 2015 UTC,"I don't like reading Tolkien at all. His writing puts me to sleep. I love the world and story but his writing is so dry, it bores me to death."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,rj20876,26,Mon Jul 20 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"We're in an unfortunate position reading Tolkien in our time.  For his readers he had to be super slow and descriptive because his readers knew nothing about the world LoTR is set in.  However, since it established and solidified fantasy settings and tries for the next 50 years, we don't need all the description. We know what elves and dwarves look like and how they act; but his original readers didn't."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,haaplo,8,Mon Jul 20 12:47:38 2015 UTC,I think it's indicative of the state of the genre currently. Anything kind of fresh and different is elevated to classic status. A lot of writers are just troping way too hard.

The thing is, I don't dislike erotica. I love her Merry Gentry series. But I'd been reading Anita Blake since right after the second book had come out and was a huge fan. And at first I didn't mind her adding some sex and relationship stuff to the series (heck, I loved it at first). But it was when that took over the plot, when she ruined Edward, when Anita didn't really spend much time doing her day job as an animator, her side job as a vamp executioner, or her other side job helping out the cops because she was too busy doing every supernatural hottie in town...well....yeah. It just wasn't a consistent run and that's what ruined it for me. (At least the Merry Gentry series started out as erotica...)   I still think one of these days I'm going to read the rest of them anyway. For shits and giggles."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,universal_straw,8,Sun Jul 19 23:11:52 2015 UTC,I'm in between. I like Kvothe (though not as much as some other fantasy protagonists) but there are some moments when he's just way too Mary Sue. The whole Felurian thing. Ugh.  I'm hoping some of it will be in some way justified by him not being totally human (his weird eyes and out-faeing Felurian and whatnot).
Fantasy,3dvqnt,writeswords_,4,Mon Jul 20 04:30:19 2015 UTC,"The whole felurian thing was sooo long, sooo unneeded and boring ... Those what .. 100/150 pages were are to read really."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,haaplo,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:49 2015 UTC,"This opinion really upsets me.  Felurian was such a secondary part to his trip to the Fae.  There was so much more to that portion of the book than him having sex. The amount of time taken on them having sex is so miniscule, not nearly 150 pages, and is the least important part of the whole section.    The story of Jax, the making of the shaed, the Ctheah, the way time works in the Fae, the fact the Fae was real, him naming her, the information she tells about the realm, the past, all way more important than him having sex.  I don't want to sound like an asshole, but it seems like the fact that there was sex in that portion of the book blinded everyone when reading that part.    EDIT: I am obviously bias, but I don't see how people can make that portion of the book about just that one thing."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,BeanAlai,5,Mon Jul 20 14:23:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for me it was the ninja sword training followed by sex with at least two different women that annoyed me.  Felurian?  That's cool.  She's a goddess.  Kvothe is famous and there's all the stuff with the fae and the setup of tragedy because of the tree.  But the whole sword training thing just wasn't very good.  It was ok, but it just came off as really weird.  Also, the entire notion that a group in Kvothe's world that isn't isolated would somehow not understand that men make women pregnant is just...beyond stupid.  The other differences were interesting on  cultural level, but the former is just dumb.  Edited some words"
Fantasy,3dvqnt,Drakengard,4,Mon Jul 20 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"I honnestly don't mind them having sex, why would I ?  But i found the whole portion way too slow for me. I enjoyed the 2 books, maybe not as much as others but it was a nice read and i'll check the 3rd.  But those .. 55 pages (i just checked), really looked like 150 to me."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,haaplo,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"It honestly seems like you do mind it.  I am not trying to be hostile about it, but I am just not sure how that section could be slow to anyone.  It is a magical realm where the rules are completely unknown, with a being who has lived for seemingly ever telling stories of the creation of the world, another being that can see the future talking to Kvothe, a cloak that is shaped from the shadows, then he names her to escape what no one else has seemingly escaped, and you don't like the section because he has sex.  I mean can you see where I am coming from?  If you (and its not just you who does this, so I may be wrong) can only bring up that part, the sex, then it does seem like it was an issue for you."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,BeanAlai,19,Mon Jul 20 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"I never understand this point of view.  He is clearly extremely proud and he is clearly extremely talented. But very little of what he says or does goes beyond what any accomplished person says or does. Kvothes pride tends to be towards his music or his heritage... assholes just have pride in themselves. Most of what Kvothe has in that direction is just self-respect.   I've known egotistical shits before. They're far more blatant. Far more insufferable, with far less reason.  I can't help but feel people who actively dislike Kvothe miss the subtext of half the things he says. There is a vast wealth of self-awareness and mockery in many of his ""prideful"" moments.  Or perhaps people have gotten so used to ""idiot protagonists"" who stumble through the story with no plan, no skills, and no idea what is going on, that they're incapable of handling the first person perspective of someone who takes action and solves their own problems.  Let's be clear, Harry Potter is an idiot. At best he charges into dangerous situation after situation blind. More often, he has to be lead by the hand every step of the way. He's also almost completely unaccomplished, and incapable of pride or most other human emotions.  He's a half complete and empty character, but he's what readers have come to expect.  At least Kvothe isn't that."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,inkedexistence,19,Sun Jul 19 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel people who actively dislike Kvothe miss the subtext of half the things he says. There is a vast wealth of self-awareness and mockery in many of his ""prideful"" moments.   Let me rephrase. Older Kvothe (Kote) is okay. He's the self-aware man who mocks his younger self the same way many readers do. However, younger Kvothe is the character we spend the vast majority of the novels with. Even knowing he eventually grows out of it doesn't make the younger Kvothe any more likeable though. The character we're presented with is still an annoying little shit who thinks he can do no wrong. Now if we see him change in the third novel I'll revise my opinion."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,universal_straw,18,Sun Jul 19 23:51:45 2015 UTC,"I still don't see it.   Yes, older Kvothe has the weight of tragedy on him which gives his character depth. And yes, younger Kvothe is... well, young. But I'm trying to think of a single instance in which younger Kvothe brags in the casual, self-assured way that assholes routinely do. I'm coming up empty.   He's young, and that skews his perspective a bit with regard to some of his actions, but he's also at pains to illustrate how terrified he is of the various problems he has and how aware he is that catastrophe could come. He takes pride in his skills and heritage, but never rubs it in anyone's face and never looks down on anyone.   At worst, I guess you could attack him for how he builds up his reputation. Yet there, sometimes he's doing it simply for the protection it provides. And often he's doing it as a kind of joke--spreading outrageous rumors that could not possibly be true with the help of his friends. Whatever is left, I have no problem chalking up to reasonable egotism and youth. Never once does he parade it in front of anyone or sit down at a table and start working his brilliance into the conversation.   I guess what it comes down to is that I'm attempting to think of how a character who was like Kvothe could come across differently, without ending up as a Potter-esque caricature of a human being... and I can't think of anything.    But oh well, to each his own."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,inkedexistence,4,Mon Jul 20 00:10:36 2015 UTC,"I think we're starting to become the minority in this opinion, /u/inkedexistence, but I completely agree with you. Kvothe will always be one of my favorite characters."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,-hondo-,7,Mon Jul 20 00:18:59 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I'm not saying that Kvothe doesn't have flaws. He does, big ones. But that's much of what humanizes him. He is arrogant at times, and prideful. But I never see those moments as particularly distasteful.   I've liked characters who were far FAR bigger shits than Kvothe."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,inkedexistence,2,Mon Jul 20 00:23:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with that, too. In fact, generally, characters having flaws tend to make me like them even more."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,NoNoNota1,2,Mon Jul 20 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"That made it worse for me. because it's told in the first person, every time he's describing something brilliant he did, it comes off like self congratulation. Overall, I really didn't understand the framing story (if that's the correct term). Kote has apparently forgotten who he is, yet when a scribe shows up he gabs for three straight days about his own awesomeness. I haven't read the second book so maybe it all gets explained, but i was so confused by all the stuff in the pub."

Normally I devour fantasy.)  And the culmination of Mistborn was a preachy letdown.  I feel like I'm going to be kicked out of the cool kid club admitting to those.  Edit to add: Neverwhere was the first novel I couldn't finish since Twilight. I found myself hoping dear bumbling Richard Mayhew would just die already.

I didn't enjoy the story all that much. Felt childish or something (might not be the best way to describe it, but its plot wasn't my jam).  So I mostly agree with you!"
Fantasy,3dvqnt,apgtimbough,5,Mon Jul 20 03:14:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed about the narration, completely. I don't know that I'll be able to finish the series. I know I am going to have to read other books between the Malazan ones at the least.  My enjoyment of Mistborn decreased with each novel. With the first one, I was very into allomancy and thought the cast of characters was fun. The second one was still alright, though any dialogue between Elend and Vin made me cringe. By the end of the third, I felt like I had been tricked into reading a doctrine of Sanderson's personal religious beliefs."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,thevertchai,8,Mon Jul 20 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"Malazan: every main character is a literal Mary sue (they were the d&d characters played by the writer and his friends); the ""complexity"" of the narrative leads to only tangents and long winded explanations of set -pieces; it ""challenges"" tropes that are prevalent in only the worst of fantasy, I.e. The d&d books that were apparently the only things anyone read before.   The prose is ugly, the world building is inhuman and empty, and it suffers deeply from H. G. Wells' observation: if anything is possible, nothing is interesting. Death? No barrier, there are doors. Really REALLY dead? Well, not if you have this machine. Every swordsman is the greatest, even if he never draws his sword (themn he does and dies immediately)...   It is pure, overwrought tedium.

I actually bought the first two books at the same time, and I disliked Prince of Thorns so much I never opened King. I would happily give both of those books away to the first person who walked up to me and asked for them."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,codexofdreams,16,Mon Jul 20 00:22:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Prince of Thorns either. It felt like the main character was constantly being rewarded for doing illogical things that usually involved craping on someone who was loyal to him. I'm all for morally suspect characters but he didn't have any redeeming qualities. He thought he was really clever and charming, but he was just a flacid cock."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,benscott81,5,Mon Jul 20 04:17:27 2015 UTC,the world was comprised of disjointed ideas   As opposed to our homogenous world?
Fantasy,3dvqnt,OlanValesco,19,Mon Jul 20 07:53:59 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Sanderson to be fairly overrated, imo. I like some of the ideas he presents and he does a decent job world building but some of his characterization and prose is just bad."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,bookishultan,3,Mon Jul 20 02:41:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like his biggest draw is the speed at which he produces new work. Maybe I'm not giving him a fair shake judging him off a single book, but even the people who love Sanderson generally agree that Stormlight is among his best work, and I figure if I didn't like that, I don't see a lot of reason to invest time and money into the rest of his stuff."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,codexofdreams,13,Mon Jul 20 02:57:17 2015 UTC,"The speed is nice but I wouldn't say that is the main reason they enjoy his work. I'd say people enjoy his world/plots the most. I always felt that he writes epic fantasy thrillers, which I really enjoy. It is just a matter of preference I suppose."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,azninvasion99,4,Mon Jul 20 03:27:39 2015 UTC,I read him more for his magic systems and world building than his plots honestly. I like how he actually explains the magic systems in detail and seeing how it is used and different aspects of powers are combined like seeing the different mix ups of mistings that fight together in the mistborn trilogy
Fantasy,3dvqnt,Frejian,17,Mon Jul 20 03:47:12 2015 UTC,"That a Song of Ice and Fire is mostly too boring to read. I've only read select story lines (from a few points of view), and I have no plans to read the rest."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,JohnLenn0n,11,Mon Jul 20 04:49:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with recommending Hobb is that her style is so slow. The plots plod forward in every book because so much of the content is introspective. It's a huge turn off to people who aren't already invested in the characters, but she gives you such a payoff. I've been a die hard fan for a decade, and I still find myself wishing she would get to the point sometimes. Then suddenly she rips out my still-beating heart and I don't know why I can't stop crying."

I haven't gone back to her but I intend to do so and start in the proper place."

It's like how people say to skip the first two Discworld books because they're terrible compared to the rest of them. I love the first two Discworld books (and the rest of them).  Same goes for Dresden Files. I enjoyed the first few books. Yeah, the later books are better, but it's not like the first few are unreadable. I dunno, again, maybe I'm just too patient?"

Fantasy,3dvqnt,RushofBlood52,2,Mon Jul 20 16:24:35 2015 UTC,I tell people this as well.  I hated the first few books then really got into the series as some nice filler between meatier books.  I only started reading because amazon had a sale where the first 7 were like 99cents a book.  so I bought them all and was willing to power through the first 3.

Fantasy,3dvqnt,RAL_9010_POWER,2,Mon Jul 20 05:34:52 2015 UTC,"I like Harry. The one thing that really bothers me is how misogynistic he is. He hates it when he sees women mistreated, but he can't meet a new female character without describing their breasts in detail."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,rakony,5,Mon Jul 20 09:55:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe not for you, but thats not a great sampling. Codex Alera is very different than Dresden, and dresden book 1 is vastly inferior to books later down the line. Dresden is one of the only series of its length I would say consistently gets better with each book.  That said, I liked the first one."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,mrbolt,7,Mon Jul 20 09:53:38 2015 UTC,"I really wish more authors would just give me the cliff-notes version of their fight scenes, particularly non-magical fights.  I'm particularly feeling this in the Malazan books.  I really don't need to know the exact details of which way Karsa Orlong twisted his sword right as he stabbed it into his opponent's upper left kidney before following through crossways, up the sternum, exiting through the neck and leaving his opponent twi... yeah, no.    The more you attempt to precisely describe something like that, the less I can picture it, and the more I'm pulled out from the flow of the narrative.  Unless there's a specific narrative reason, just give me a vague description of the action and let me fill in the details in my head, or just cut to an after-action scene and find a way to summarize what I missed.  I really appreciate the Wheel of Time approach, which just uses fake sword maneuver names, so you get fights like ""The Boar Rushing Down the Mountain was countered by The Falling Leaf into Fanning the Air..."""

Many key characters are superficial, the plot and the setting adored for their ""expansive"" nature actually lack depth and realism, the grit and gore is often there for the sake of it, not because it's an organic part of the narrative.  Sanderson's books are all the same. You've read one of his series, you've read them all."

I found the MC to be a marty stu who was to perfect (he even had the trench coat) and he came in of course to teach the girl who was soo special and unique. And the girl lost all character after leaving the gang hideout. Also the world was just to bleak and ashy for me. I like light and adventure and this world was just to somber and dull. The inquisitors didn't really feel new to me. Though im used to the idea of them from history and other fictions with hunters like them (star wars for instance)  The only thing i did like was the fighting scenes because they were really cool. The magic system its self was also cool as well.  Also i didn't like Ready Player One and stopped after the four page angry atheist rant.

Definitely with quirks, though."

Immortal OP soldiers, unnecessary resurrections, deus ex machinas, annoying marines flood during hundreds of pages, dozens of unnecessary useless characters.  And cheesy disneyish happy happy end...

It was a tolerable enough YA fantasy, until that final book. Such an overbearing, shove-religion-down-your-throat, invalidate all the sacrifices that have come before, kind of ending. One of the few books I've tossed in the trash, unwilling to inflict upon another.  Also, loved the first Mistborn novel, but really didn't care for the rest of the series."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,kzielinski,2,Mon Jul 20 04:29:48 2015 UTC,I never notice the religion in Narnia.  That may be because I read them first when I was 8 and also I was in a real life religion that was already taking up all Sunday and Monday nights and mornings and evenings the rest of the week.

The first few were fantastic but it just got more and more dull with the story not advancing and the shock value of killing important characters disappeared when it kept happening over and over again. Haven't even read the 5th book yet; don't really have any interest to anytime soon either.
Fantasy,3dvqnt,FishPhoenix,5,Tue Jul 21 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"I think the Stormlight Archive is utter drivel with poor writing, which is seemingly made up for in 'epic' plot and world. It feels like pseudo angst from Kaladin, Shallan is really inconsistent and a poor attempt at a 'strong' female character'. None of it is made up for in the prose, which I often allow for. The magic is like a poor video game mechanic that is explained to us in the prologue like a bad video game's manual. The unnecessary flashbacks are unnecessary and offer nothing that couldn't have been shown in the main narrative with intelligent craft. Another magic jesus in the form of Kaladin is a bit lame tbh. I honestly thought that The Final Empire was a better book than both the Stormlight Archive books together."

Another thing that made me abandon the book was the dialogue with a plenthora of curses that I found to be fourth-wall-breaking because of their total lack of realism and overplayed wit. Hard to explain, but similarly infuriating. Not sure what I am going to do with my copy now."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,PresDeeJus,4,Mon Jul 20 07:11:29 2015 UTC,"I stared at this comment for awhile, and it's hard to properly put this. But, magic can be made into behaving like a super power(a definite specialized ability that does x, like just being able to shoot eye lasers). Magic however is often grander, it speaks to the artistry of existence, it's a way of seeing and interpreting the world, and so much more. Like, the thing is, most writers these days don't seem to really look into magic and how it fits into worldviews and such in reality but instead seek to super define it in the manner that it becomes a science rather than an Art, or it becomes a super power. I mean, I'm on my phone so trying to articulate this properly is kind of hard. But yeah."

Mistborn is fine, but that's all; an interesting magic system is not sufficient to carry a 600 page novel, and the novel had little else to recommend it.  The ending of Broken Empire is the worst ending I can recall. It makes the finale of BSG look like a goddamned masterpiece in comparison."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,mxlm,4,Mon Jul 20 04:11:06 2015 UTC,"I find The Wheel of Time's popularity to be completely baffling.  I could understand it if it was well written. It is not. Jordan's prose is overwrought, clunky, and far too fixated on pointless detail and minutiae. He has much maligned repeated phrases and tics that he keeps coming back to. He stops the action to have characters explain the history of one location for pages on end.The books' length is inflated far beyond the actual length required to tell this story as a result.  I could understand if the characters were really interesting and dynamic. They are not. Our protagonists are painfully one-dimensional, archetypal, and above all dull. Meanwhile the villains are cartoonishly evil. They are antagonists, because they threaten people, wear black, and cackle. The core conflict of the series is simply not very interesting, because none of the people involved are interesting.  I could understand it if it wasn't mind-numbingly sexist and gender essentialist. Which it is. The core message of the series, at least from the part that I read, is ""Men do men things and women do women things, and they'll never really understand each other, but they have to get along or else nothing great would ever get done."" Which is, frankly, total BS, as I hope anyone who has ever spoken to a member of the opposite sex can attest to. Given how he characterizes the vast majority of his female characters, I don't think it's that much of a stretch to say that Jordan had major issues with women.  I try to avoid dropping series whenever I can, but The Wheel of Time is one of the few times I've made that exception. I made it 200 pages into the fourth book before realizing that I didn't care about literally anything in the series, and I still had 10 books to go after this one. As it turns out, that seems to be a fairly common stopping place for non-fans of the series, at least on this sub.  If 1-4 are supposedly the ""good"" books in this series, I can't even conceive of how bad Crossroads of Twilight is."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,greatlaker7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"I dislike Joe Ambercrombie's writing.  I read through The First Law trilogy and several other of his books.  I wanted to get into them, but it was just awful to me.  I liked some of his characters but the story was half-hearted and felt secondary to coming up with more and more terrible people.  Most of it felt like he was pulling plot from a hat and trying to wrangle it together with duct tape and wishes.  I think it was The Heroes that finally I had to quit on.  I know people gushed on how the battle scenes were written, but they felt overplayed and boring."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,Decyohno,3,Mon Jul 20 10:55:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, this is the thread to for me. Now, where to get started.  First: I'm so done with people saying Tolkien is the father of the fantasy genre when historically there were others you can point to for being the start such as Lord Dunsany or going further back, George MacDonald or William Morris. Like, there are many people and arguably better people writing before Tolkien.  Second: Tolkien's not even that good. I'll give him points for worldbuilding, but his writing is dry and plodding, his characters leave much to be desired, and I'm just done with people acting like he did all this great stuff.   Third: Harry Potter wasn't that great either. Harry was a shitty protagonist who was literally a jock with a trust fund who found out he was the most special person ever, fuck that. Hermione would've made a better protagonist, Neville would've been pretty interesting, but really Rowling's characters lacked a sense of realism considering who they are. Any person of our world that finds out they have magic powers and their only limit is knowledge would hop to when it comes to studying such that they can become truly great. Also, her plots create massive holes, such as the time turners! I'm done with how people see her as being that great, and I hate how it seems that people think of her as the creator of the magic school trope or that she even did it that well!  Fourth: This is less an unpopular opinion about a novel or series, but just thinking in general. Sanderson's rules about writing magic are to me, rather bullshit especially because the magic systems he creates feel more like freaking super powers than anything reflecting magic. I wouldn't trust any rules this guy made on writing.  Fifth: Continuation of Fourth, any rules on writing be it grammar or how to write magic or stating that ""Any sufficiently advanced technology are indistinguishable from magic,"" are stupid and should die. It's incredibly frustrating, strangles thought, and imo points out how little you know or truly have thought through the many ways something can be portrayed if you have even a bit of fucking skill.  That's all I got for now, and I'd like to state. Just because I dislike a lot of stuff doesn't mean you can't still like it or read it. I'm not gonna come break into your house and set your books on fire. That'd be a crime, and I'm also way too lazy to do that."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,MadxHatter0,25,Mon Jul 20 00:57:27 2015 UTC,"Regarding the ""Father of Fantasy"" thing it's more that Tolkein is considered foundational to a lot of the fantasy that followed his work, not that he somehow invented the genre. As many have pointed out, epic fantasy is arguably the first example of written literature period. Homer, or Ovid or whoever wrote Gilgamesh may as well be the father of fantasy."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,7ujmnbvfr456yhgt,6,Mon Jul 20 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"And Tolkien's arguable greatest contribution to the 20th century fantasy genre was to be a respectable person (Oxford professor!) who said ""Hey!  Great old works of literature are great because of the dragons, not in spite of the dragons!"""
Fantasy,3dvqnt,UnsealedMTG,22,Mon Jul 20 03:49:50 2015 UTC,"Sanderson never said that your magic systems have to have specific rules the way his do, but rather that your audience has to understand magic if you want to use it for plot resolution. The rule is meant to keep authors from using magic as a cheap handwave for justifying ridiculous Deus Ex Machinas, not from having loosely defined magic systems to begin with."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,Logic_Nuke,18,Mon Jul 20 02:50:39 2015 UTC,"It's actually part of his rules that you can have vaguely defined magic and still make it work as long as the audience has some understanding of its limits. His best example is Gandalf, who's magic basically amounts to him just being Gandalf."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,Momojo,7,Mon Jul 20 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"I personally love the way Sanderson does his magic systems. I love that he takes the time and energy to actually think out and explain what the magic systems in his books can do and how he leads you throughout the book to different uses of them as the story unravels. I think his magic systems and world building in general are why I love him as an author so much. I absolutely hate when stories just say something along the lines of ""and then everything was fixed because he waved a wand and magic happened."" That gives no thought at all to how the magic is done or if there are any limits to what it can do. Everything in the universe has some type of limits."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,Frejian,4,Mon Jul 20 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"See, but that complaint has to do with crappy writing as opposed to anything having to do with the magic. I don't truly know how magic in The Broken Empire series truly works but the series still works perfectly fine."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,MadxHatter0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:32:09 2015 UTC,"I couldn't read the important latter three books of Harry Potter because after Goblet of Fire I just could not read through another Dursley passage ever again --- but it's so important to Order of the Phoenix. I keep meaning to try again, because it's been ten years now and the series is complete, but no dice.  I just thought, why doesn't Dumbledore make him a ward of the Weasleys? Why doesn't Hermione take him home? I know the Dursleys are important to the latter part of the story, but they just sickened me as people. I found that with Kylara in Dragonquest as well and actually that's a compliment to the writers, because they made me care about these characters as much as I care about, e.g. Cersei in ASOIAF or Cheerwell in Shadows of the Apt...they were just people in whose company I didn't want to spend any more of my time.  Regarding Sanderson's laws - they are pretty important to avoiding magic just being a deus ex machina and I've listened to him on Writing Excuses stress that they are not meant to make magic directly into superpowers; they're more designed to help construct a convincing narrative regardless of actual system-building. But I sort of agree on his actual execution. I enjoy his stories, but he is responsible for the fad of over-complicated, weird and often gross magic systems, and maybe there is beauty in simplicity."
Fantasy,3dvqnt,crowqueen,2,Mon Jul 20 09:47:46 2015 UTC,"The prose in Lord of the Rings was flowery and dry, the dialogue was stilted, and the characterisation was incredibly minimal for virtually everyone. Tolkien just wasn't an amazing author and I think his enduring fame owes more to the fact that he was a decent worldbuilder and one of the first guys in fantasy who could write above the pulp level than to his writing skill.  And don't get me started on Lovecraft."

Fantasy,3dvqnt,crowqueen,0,Mon Jul 20 09:22:11 2015 UTC,"The Sword of Truth is a strong series with a few niggling issues. The author made a bad decision in turning it into a political vehicle, whether you agree with the politics or not, because it has all the appearance of escapist fantasy before it does a 180 at around book 6.  Otherwise, most of the major criticisms are unfounded. I see so many detractors who invent scenes or just do not understand the characters at all. For example, Richard did not murder a bunch of pacifists for being pacifists, nor did he abandon his army because they let him down, nor does he become an unstoppable super wizard at any point in the books, up to and including the last one.  I see others laughably criticizing it for resembling the Wheel of Time, when both series are just playing up generic fantasy tropes going back decades. Or they say the prose is weak, like almost every mainstream fantasy novel of the last 20 years. Or they don't like book 10 or whatever, or some petty issues with one particular chapter they use to denounce the whole series.  I just find it irritating. If you don't like a book, fine, but why lie about it to make it look worse?"

Fantasy,3du0vb,MarkLawrence,15,Sun Jul 19 16:41:06 2015 UTC,This is a really good introduction to a VERY good trilogy. It's very action-based with a well-developed industrial setting backdrop. I think the second book (The Crimson Campaign) does a really nice job of keeping the same pace and originality of Promise of Blood and adding depth to the characters.   I'd encourage pretty much everyone to give it a shot for $1.99. It's a steal.
Fantasy,3du0vb,justamathnerd,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:23 2015 UTC,trilogy   Trilogy? On goodreads there is 10 books from the same serie. Are they not worth reading?

Here's the main trilogy:   Promise of Blood The Crimson Campaign The Autumn Republic   Then, there are a bunch of short stories/novellas.

To see how they fit chronologically, here's a link to the /r/powdermage wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/powdermage/wiki/short-fiction-read-order  I really like the short fiction, but they aren't ""essential."""

Fantasy,3du0vb,justamathnerd,12,Mon Jul 20 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"It's been almost 2 years since I first read this book, but my takeaway at the time was of an exciting, action-packed story and amazingly cool concept - the powder mages whose magic is worked via gunpowder - which made up for what I felt was a lack of fully developed characters in book 1. To be fair I read it almost immediately after The Lies of Locke Lamora, so what I felt was a fantastic character development and action combo in Lies could have influenced my perception of tPoB's shortcomings in fully bringing the characters to life. I still gave it a rare 5 stars on Goodreads (Lies being the only other 5-stars that year) because what it did well made for a super entertaining read that I couldn't stop thinking about well after the final page."

In the recent /r/powdermage survey, the general consensus was that Promise of Blood was not the best of the trilogy.  Personally, I thought that The Crimson Campaign (the second in the series) was amazing. So yah, it does.  BUT...I don't know if it'll get much better for you. The writing definitely tightens up, although I enjoyed the style of writing in Promise of Blood, and it doesn't really change. If you're not enjoying it, then you probably won't enjoy the rest of the series."

One is training to be the future emporer with a bunch of monks that teach him crazy letting go of your emotion tricks, one that is her father's secratary and is trying to figure out a big plot,and one that is training to a sort of super soldier that flies on a giant bird. It is amazing."

Fantasy,3dy5tv,Zakkeh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"Try Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Jim Butcher, Scott Lynch.   None of them are exactly like Rothfuss, but they all share certain elements.   Rothfuss considers Jim Butcher's Dresden Files to be the single best fantasy series ever written (though the first three are the weakest).   Neil Gaiman is a genius. Try Neverwhere and Stardust first.  Terry Pratchett wrote the funniest and smartest stuff you'll ever read.   Scott Lynch is usually my recommendation for ""a book anyone should enjoy."" If you don't like the Lies of Locke Lamora, you probably just don't like fantasy."

Fantasy,3dupba,mmSNAKE,6,Mon Jul 20 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"Want an intelligent read? Try R.Scott Bakker's Second Apocalypse. Starting with The Darkness That Comes Before. It certainly has themes worth thinking about, though his books can be exhausting, but brilliant nevertheless.  Acts of Caine by Matthew Stover, if you want philosophy of violence, choice, identity, primal urges and a very heavy dose of social cometary and criticism, look here. Main character doesn't really do much magic (he kills people with his bare hands mostly) but series in general has a whole damn lot of magic and other fantastical elements.  Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson if you want to have a series that covers more themes than I can remember. Ranging from social, political, ethical, moral and all sort of philosophical musings all packed with magic everywhere soldiers, shapeshifting super elves, ice mage centered orcs with a sense of humor, and a race of super zombies hell bent on targeted genocide.  Wars of Light and Shadow by Janny Wurts, free will is a very good theme that it explores throughout the series. Obviously morality and choice. Story is about two half brothers who are bound to the fate of the planet they are having their err disagreements.   Broken Empire by Mark Lawrence. Follows a sociopath prince in exile that really does some nasty things with a fairly blase attitude regarding it.  The Black Company by Glen Cook, following a band of elite mercenaries that go from one job to the next. Morality is a big one here, essentially teaching you not try try to be certain to label things good, bad or evil. Since it is a mess.   All of these should have plenty of what you are asking for."

Fantasy,3dupba,RonnieRim,2,Sun Jul 19 22:09:17 2015 UTC,How exactly does the theme of compassion's virtue manifest in the series? Is it mostly in large fate-of-the-world type or conflicts or is it in the characters' narrower and more personal conflicts? What are some of the other more prominent themes?
Fantasy,3dupba,yetanotherhero,7,Mon Jul 20 00:30:58 2015 UTC,"Compassion manifests itself in everything from the smallest character interactions to the largest of world-shattering events - when people say that Malazan is about compassion, they really mean it. There are possibly dozens of themes in this series, Erikson loves his themes and has said before that his stories are virtually written around them. Some of these other themes include the follies of pride and greed, the importance to never underestimate even the smallest players in the game (eg. in the battles between gods, even a lowly mortal can make a real impact) etc."
Fantasy,3dupba,Tarcanus,5,Mon Jul 20 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"In regards to your first two questions, it's both. The reader is first introduced to compassion as an overt theme of a particular character's arc. From that point, we see compassion rear its thematic head several times throughout the story, with different characters and settings, until finally its relevance to some- perhaps all- of the most central, earth shaking conflicts of the series becomes clear.   Other prominent themes include the cruelty and cost of war, the nature of justice, power and its use for oppression or liberation, and vengeance. Close reading and re-reading reveals how the central theme of compassion interweaves and over-arches the rest of these themes. It's an incredibly ambitious work, and not without its flaws. But it really is something to finish the ten books and realise you just read an epic fantasy examination of the human condition. Featuring undead dinosaurs with swords for arms."
Fantasy,3dupba,jabari74,0,Mon Jul 20 04:14:38 2015 UTC,"It won't do it justice to even try to explain.  Whereas many fantasy books have characters as the focus or plot or magic, Erikson focused on the themes of the novels.  The books wind up being a bit philosophically heavy at times, and he does explore other themes as he goes along(civilization, empire, greed, excess, etc) but compassion is always there at its core.  The main plotline's resolution is nothing but an extreme act of compassion.  To try to boil down the ""how is the theme expressed?"" question would be futile."

Fantasy,3dupba,lrich1024,4,Sun Jul 19 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"I just meant themes that can be easily tied to peoples everyday lives. Things like family, friendship, finding ones place in the world are themes I'd consider grounded and relatable. Themes like power, good vs evil, justice are all much more abstract to me and I wouldn't consider them very relatable or grounded."
Fantasy,3dupba,yetanotherhero,5,Sun Jul 19 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"Daniel Abraham's work is what you're looking for.  The long price quartet is about self-sacrifice, aging, and responsibility; the dragon's path books are about guilt, selfishness, the banality of evil, and professional ethics."
Fantasy,3dupba,pornokitsch,5,Sun Jul 19 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"If you're into court intrigue and not expecting too much action/adventure, I'd highly recommend The Goblin Emperor. Very grounded and very relatable themes. Very prominent themes. One of the reasons I enjoyed it so much, relatability. It has some magic, but it's not a huge feature in the series, but it about fantastical races of beings so it's very much fantasy."
Fantasy,3dupba,wishforagiraffe,5,Mon Jul 20 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"Based on this, I'd heartily recommend the work of Guy Gavriel Kay. I've only read two of his books so far, but both were very human and involved the themes you mention. Tigana especially weaves a heartbreaking tale about family, loss, grief, revenge and above all the sense of belonging to a home."

I got to sit down with Terry Dowling and listening to him speak was worth the whole event for me. He is such a great guy, full of fantastic advice and you can see the pedigree he comes from. Stories about Christmas dinner with Jack Vance; Harlan Ellison picking apart your major award winning story backstage after you just received the award; lunch with Raymond Feist, I could have listened to Terry all day long. Bought his book Basic Black, the stories are incredible.  /u/benpeek was a classic on the panels bringing some fire and comic relief. I think his point about lazy fantasy writing is spot on. Got a chance to chat with him and he is a great guy. Totally forgot to get my book signed, idiot.  Robert Hood's Fragments of a Broken Land is excellent so far and is such a departure from the tired, old fantasy that's everywhere. I bought it after listening to him talk, I'd never heard of him before.  Getting to tell Kaaron Warren how awesome Slights is was a highlight, too. All in all a great day for me.

Fantasy,3dseg8,sharklops,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"He was indeed a fight choreographer, and he sometimes still does staged fights at literary events.   He’s a really interesting guy to talk to about writing sword fights. He tends to avoid historical terminology because he’s writing about a fantasy world and doesn’t want to disrupt the reader’s immersion in it, but he knows his stuff.   The really intriguing thing he told me was he tries to put in a few cues about how the fighters think early on, so when the battles really get going the readers are able to choreograph the scenes for themselves in their imagination. Apparently, readers tell him about their favourite fight moments all the time, and they’re usually remembering things he didn’t even write — he supplied some cues and they created their own scenes/stories. Very cool. Exactly what you want as a writer.   I should probably have him back for a podcast just about writing fight scenes. He’s such an interesting guy to talk to."

(The first time I watched Escaflowne it was a copy of a copy of a copy of a fansub on VHS. Unwatchable now days but back then you took what you could get.) Also why conventions were so important! Now days everything is right at your fingertips and videos are streaming. Man, what a time to be alive."

Like I paid this guy good money for a VHS rip of the Fist of the North Star movie once, and as a special surprise, the tape ran for 4 hours so he just taped Ninja Scroll at the end of it as a bonus without telling me. Winked at me though and told me to watch through the credits. Still one of the greatest true surprises I ever received.  He was like that drug dealer that gave you extra just because.

Mecha, telaporting to another world, etc. It's got a great story (imo) and has a very fantasy feel to it (even with the air ships and mecha...I mean the mech do sword fighting at one point iirc...lol).

Kids these days are not limited by what the library or local bookstore has on the shelves, and (even more critically IMO) spending your pocket money on a book is no longer a roll of the dice. With 10 seconds effort, you can make sure you're reading in the right order, how many other books are available, and most important of all, if a book is likely to be worth your time and money. It's been a long time since I read a book that was just not worth reading, and I have the internet to thank for that.  Secondly, connecting to others who share your interests. No one in my high school that I knew of was into fantasy and sci fi like I was.

I didn't grow up with a computer at a very young age like kids do now, but I started using the internet probably in my first year of middle school a lot. I love delving into things but I think the problem is when you realize just how much information is out there its hard to motivate yourself to learn about it in depth when you're not sure you're ""into it.""  People at a younger age are just figuring out what they like/don't like. Sure its easier to find what you like/don't but those things also change all the time. There have been some studies surrounding music talking about how taste solidifies at a certain age (sorry too lazy to look up more) but maybe that's the reason.

Fantasy,3dsd14,TheShroomer,2,Sun Jul 19 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"I think part of it may also be the ability to skim through information on a huge variety of subjects, versus the previous tendency to really delve into something. What with sites like wikipedia, one can simply ""wiki-surf""--click on the meta-links contained within each wikipedia article and learn a little bit about a lot of things. so the meaning of a sentence like ""I know a litle bit about planetary science"" means a very different thing from what it did several decades ago.  on a somewhat related note, I think this goes for reading too. Those who do read a lot tend not to dissect the books they are reading, but skim through them. There's something really special about going back to a book and marvelling at all the little details that you missed, or thought unimportant the first time around."
Fantasy,3dsd14,eean,3,Sun Jul 19 01:56:20 2015 UTC,"I agree about the delving.

Like I'll make an analogy with spell check. I think it has done more to improve my spelling than anything else. The ritual of spelling a word wrong and then fixing it reinforces correct spelling. Maybe there are issues it creates - when I don't have spell check I get paranoid and start googling words that I actually spelled correctly but look 'weird'.   So similarly I'm open to the idea that there are side-effects to having so much information at our fingertips. But the idea of ""laziness because you can look something up"" is odd. Yea we don't memorize phone numbers anymore, but being able to look up a fact the second you want to know it is just enabling learning."

Then try not to roll your eyes when I explain that you're not banking on skill, you're banking on a very temporary biological advantage, and that those ""campers"" you whine so much about are really just owning your ass with superior tactics. (Oh by the way, do you know where the term camping from? Because I do. I've played that map. Setting an ambush ain't camping, junior. Sitting in the fucking tent all match is camping.)  So  take your COD and your weapon skins and your furious insistence that you really can tell the difference between 30ms and 50ms pings, in defiance of all knowledge of neurology and step the fuck off...  ...of my lawn."
Fantasy,3dsd14,TroubleEntendre,3,Sun Jul 19 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"I remember pulling off a dark horse in UT2k4 (TAM) or Clan Arena in Quake. With people who make split second decisions and tactics in less than a second. Kids these days don't understand what sort of reflexes and tactics were needed for games that don't have such HUGE 'margins of error' for performance.  In general when it comes to shooters I've been around since the start of it all. I dislike getting lectured on the genre, what it means to be a good player or worse on history and purpose of some mechanics in these games. No kids, CoD did not invent the wheel. Quake was what really jumpstarted the whole thing. It was not the first, but Quake had a MASSIVE impact on the MP portion of the genre.  Oh lol the ping thing. I played UT2k4 hardcore. Going from LAN to 30ms to 50ms to 100ms. Those who say it makes no difference are the same as people saying one can't see difference between 30fps or 60fps more.  Honestly I don't feel I'm getting old in this. I just feel that some younger generation are so badly misinformed and aggressively opinionated in their limited point of view. I honestly marvel at it. All information they would want a keystroke away, and they chose to argue in ignorance...  Anyway I feel that these posts are more for pcmasterrace sub haha."

Fantasy,3dsd14,tilfordkage,3,Sun Jul 19 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"26yo here, but I work with kids (middle school, so 12 to 16 yo).   My take on this: the ""nerdy kids"" we almost all grew up as still exist. They're still reading (caught a 12yo girl reading Stephen King's It a few months ago), playing D&D, Magic and Warhammer, and they're still a tiny (mostly middle-to-upper class, mostly white) minority.  The difference that a lot of us are seeing is due to the fact that some things that were nerdy and ""underground"" when we were kids are now completely mainstream. Lord of the Rings. Game of Thrones. Star Wars (not that underground, but shit, it's owned by Disney now). Marvel/DC comics (mostly through film). We look at this and think we're seeing a generation of geeks growing up, but we're really not, not once you get past the superficial similarities.  Most kids know of Star Wars and have seen some of the movies and/or animated series. Will it make them SF fans? Nope - they'll watch the next ""Explosions in Space"" blockbuster, but they're not gonna read Peter Watts or China Miéville. Most people have watched Game of Thrones. That won't make them all fantasy fans waiting on pins and needles for the next installment of the Gentlemen Bastards or Kingkiller Chronicles. Most/all kids own and use computers regularly...for Twitter and Instagram. That won't make them all Unix geeks or coders.  I guess what I'm trying to say here is that while some nerdy cultural milestones have indeed gone mainstream, the ""nerdy"" personality type is still very much the same - mostly the province of lonely, socially awkward boys and girls. I'm not passing judgement on anyone or anything - for what it's worth, I'm glad than ""geek culture"" and fandom are both becoming more visible, more inclusive and more ""mainstream"". But just because there's a fad for fantasy in mainstream culture right now doesn't mean than geeks are everywhere."

I did know about the Transformers Cartoons and I love Star Wars, when we would go over to some friends house when I was like 5/6 my parents and their friends would want to talk without kiddo rushing around being annoying. So i would get plopped down in front of tv to watch Star Wars on tape.  I've never really gotten the 10 miles in snow fantasy version. If i'm honest haven't really met that many older fantasy fans.

I assume this puts me mostly in this ""growing older"" group but I do see things my generation does that  makes us like the younger one, too.  I always feel like I have to play catch-up on a lot of stuff.  There are a lot of great authors that have put out work in the last ten years, but all that wealth of fantasy between mythology/fairy tales and 2005 is gigantic.  The last hundred years has had a boom, but the later you're born, the more likely you are to read books by yourself or have to look to the internet for kinship (meaning that current buzz of new stuff dies down eventually and less people pick it up).  It's easier to find people now through the internet now; back in high school you had to pester your nerdy friends to read the Belgariad or the Xanth novels so that you had someone to talk to about it.  Finding new stuff was also harder, knowing you were probably going to be alone with your thoughts on it.  I didn't have an internet connection steadily until I was 18, so word-of-mouth and perusing the library were how I found new books to read.  I just didn't know how large the scope of fantasy was.  There was no way to.  Occasionally I'd get someone to take me to a used book store or Borders :( where I could look at what was there, but then if there was no demand, there was no product.  Just wanted to point out there was a thread on /r/AskReddit some time ago about what the Baby Boomers/Generation X liked about the younger generations.  Someone pointed out that Millenials tend to not be stuck in liking the tastes of their generation.  It's exciting to see that there are new nerds out there, but know that it might take them a long ass time to take on the vast collection of nerddom."

Clarke and similar when I was in high school. The newer exceptions like Terry Pratchett or Douglas Adams were because of friend recommendations. I really didn't figure out the scope of how much scifi/fantasy was being written right now and how great it was until after college really and started reading Charles Stross. There's just so much history to get through.   Someone pointed out that Millenials tend to not be stuck in liking the tastes of their generation.   There's another unnamed generation, the one the 8 year old downstairs is in. He was playing Super Mario on his Wii U the other day (even if his dad hadn't mentioned it I would've known from his singing the theme outside lol.) Well for one thing it shows both the strength and weakness of Nintendo that they have 8 year olds playing 20 year old games on their latest-greatest system. :D But is also a good example of your point. I mean for that unnamed generation Minecraft is probably the most important game which is really all sorts of awesome."

It didn't matter to me that it was my old man's book (in fact, it was written six years before he was born so it wasn't exactly of his generation, either); in fact, having that connection with him, finally, made it better.  And I just so happened to like Bradbury, so that helped.  My thing was always comedy.  When I got my own TV in my room, around 12, I watched Comedy Central constantly.  Any sort of stand-up, specials, even some of the movies I didn't really get that they were playing (which reminds me, I have to give This Is Spinal Tap another go since I've aged a little bit since then).  There was always something new to discover.  Monty Python? How about The Kids In The Hall or Are You Being Served or Fawlty Towers? It just never ends.

It helps, too, that many younger readers are happy to gab about the media they're passionate about. They feel more accessible than older nerds did to me when I reached out to them while I was young and seeking out novel media.  At 33, turning 34 in a month, I'm amused by people younger than me who are struggling with the even-younger-still crowd. I didn't just grow up after the Pokemon wave - there is a bracket of people younger than me annoyed than the kids younger than them didn't grow up with Pokemon. It makes me feel two generations out of date. It's the same reckoning as every generation experiences.    I grew up without C.S. Lewis and Ursula Le Guin. I didn't know who G.K. Chesterton was until I was 25, or Richard Matheson until I was 28. I think we all have canonical authors we missed, but also every generation has different media that becomes core to their psyches.

Like /u/benpeek suggested to me, you might find some in the New Weird push: Mieville, Charan Newton, Swainton etc.  Woops: Caitlin R. Kiernan is one of the best dark fantasy, cosmic horror writers out there.  Stephen Graham Jones is awesome. His story ""Raphael"" is available at www.nightmare-magazine.com for free.  These two are probably closest to what you are looking for:  Something Red by Douglas Nicholas  Between Two Fires by Christopher Beuhlman  I will recommend the DarkFuse novella line:  Whom the Gods Would Destroy by Brian Hodge is SF, but one of the most exciting finds of the last couple of years for me.  Conduits by Jennifer Loring is based in Japanese folklore and is a deeply emotional work about pain and loss. Incredible stuff.  For me, I think the literary horror/weird lit stuff is a lot more interesting than fantasy at the moment. You are getting more experimental styles and writing, and generally a higher level of craft.   Terry Dowling is an author I have just found and had the pleasure of meeting yesterday. He counts Jack Vance as a close friend and Harlan Ellison. His story Nightside Eye is a great cosmic story.  I could go on all day about this stuff. I beleive /u/TFrohock 's Miserere: an Autumn Tale might fit part of what you a looking for.  /u/AuthorSAHunt 's gunslinger/cosmic horror/weird steampunk western/epic fantasy Outlaw King Series is a must.

I recognize Kiernan from a documentary I watched about Lovecraft's life, so I guess there are some automatic credentials. I don't think I ever would have picked up one of her books based on the cover art, which look like those supernatural romance novels that are so popular. If you don't mind my asking, which would you say is her best? Or which work best captures that oppressive atmosphere?"
Fantasy,3ds7uq,thelonelypubman,2,Sun Jul 19 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"They all have it. The Red Tree is fantastic: twisting narrative, unreliable narrator, creeping dread. The writing is incredible.   The Drowning Girl is very good, too. It's a tie with them two. Her novel Threshold looks very intriguing.   I would recommend Kaaron Warren's Slights. Not fantasy, but easily one of the best horror novels I have ever read. It such an interesting premise; when you die everyone you ever slighted is waiting in a room to do things to you.

Add that with the creeping dread and off-kilter feeling she expertly builds throughout the novel and you have something that feels very cosmic - to me, anyway. It might not be what your idea of Lovecraft's cosmicsm is, but I think it's pretty close.  Also if you are into Lovecraft try /u/RamseyCampbell. He is regarded as a modern successor to Lovecraft and I found his novel Ancient Images very good. His short fiction I have read is excellent.

Fantasy,3ds7uq,Bergmaniac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:11:51 2015 UTC,"Does any of Kiernan's work involve "" the minimizing of humanity's importance in the grand scheme of things""?   Definitely. It's probably most overtly expressed in her science fiction works. The Dry Salvages, (which is a short novel or a long novella depending on classification), is probably the clearest example, but it's also pretty common in her short fiction (e.g. Riding the White Bull). But is a common theme in her supposedly more overtly horror and fantasy works too, though it's usually more subtle. Her earlier novel Threshold is probably the most clear example of that. There the alien entities are vastly powerful, mysterious and quite indifferent to humanity."

Fantasy,3ds7uq,eferoth,6,Sun Jul 19 02:28:32 2015 UTC,"This won't quite fit, as I don't think it's really what you're looking for but I'm gonna rec it anyway because it was the first time in ages that I got a major Lovecraft vibe throughout.  It's Stephen King's last year novel called 'Revival'.  Now, this is a decidedly 'King' book. Drug abuse, small town, journey through life, reflection on it, but while writing that, he wrote one of the greatest homages to Lovecraft ever put to paper. He even acknowledges it from the start.  If recced it wholeheartedly and enthusiastically on /r/lovecraft after I read it when it came out and got mixed responses. Some agreed, some just called it boring. The lesson learned was that you need to like King with all his trappings as well as Lovecraft to enjoy it.  The themes match, the topics match, the outlook and outcome matches. I called it 'the book HPL would write today if he weren't shit at dialogue' before and I stand by it.  It's subtle though. This is not a tentacle fest. This is a subtle tale even for, or rather despite being by King. This would be subtle for any author. Next to no violence or gore or anything. It's just the story of a random dude's life, starting in the 60s up to nowadays, interspersed with paranormal mad-scientist stuff via the secondary character. It's very Charles Dexter Ward sometimes and there are dozens of different parallels one could draw to other HPL shorts. Telling more would spoil.  It doesn't fit quite what you're asking for because the cosmic horror thing isn't quite present, but it features something that HPL was equally as good at because they go hand in hand.  Existential Horror. Questioning your own existence. In spades! Can't stress this enough. Shivers all over.  Suffice it to say, that I love reading SK anyway, but this was something else at the end. Creeped me the fuck out for all the right reasons.  Edit: My /r/Lovecraft post from a year ago."

In any case, you'll run into a lot of books that call themselves Lovecraftian, but almost none that actually are. It tends to just be a term for tentacles and the end of the world. The Laundry Files are an example of this. They're sometimes decent novels, but silly and stupid more than they are scary or depressing (for that read his novella ""A Colder War"").  Other books include the Maplecroft series (not very good), American Elsewhere, the Milkweed books (excellent).  Of those, only Milkweed is genuinely dark, and even then it's not really Lovecraftian. Great books though  You might also try the short fiction of Thomas Ligotti. He's the closest we have to a modern day Lovecraft.  If you're looking for scifi, try Peter Watts' Blindsight."

Daryl Gregory just won a Locus and Shirley Jackson Award for his novella ""We Are All Completely Fine"" - a disturbing horror story about a support group for people who have survived attacks from supernatural monsters/killers.

While it stuck with some fantasy tropes it also eskewed a lot of the typical heroic ideals. However, I think he's really hit his stride in his Elder Empire series, which began with the double novel Of Sea and Shadow/Of Shadow and Sea. They take place in a world where elder gods and their minions have a huge role in the daily lives of the populace. As a fan of both fantasy and lovecraft, this scratched an itch that I didn't know I had. I strongly recommend it.  Edit: also Christopher Kellen's Arbiter Codex/Elements of Sorcery take place in a world where the backdrop is sort of lovecraftian (the only gods are Elder gods)."

Also has a downright gorgeous (relatively speaking) description of a shoggoth in the third book I believe it was.  To some degree, the Vampire Hunter D series walks the line. There is lots of little Lovecraftian flourishes throughout. Ironically, the one book that specifically talks about an Elder God was the least Lovecraftian. Also more on the gothic atmosphere than straight up cosmic horror.  If you dig The Elder Scrolls at all, and never have dug around in the lore, snoop around. Hermeas-Mora and his realm are straight up madness/forbidden knowledge and there's other things around that.  I'm fully planning on building these aspects in my own series. The first book has a few bits and bobs here or there. The next one will build on that, so and so forth, until I get to what will most likely be The End. I haven't decided yet but eventually, one of the books will go balls out.  I'm really trying to think of more but off the top of my head, this is all I can think of.

Maybe foraging with Woodcraft or being able to conceal yourself?  My argument is that the book doesn't show a clear picture on the rules of Furycraft. We have Amara, Bernard and Isana as main characters that only ever display 1 or 2 areas of Furycraft and display not even a small amount of skill any other area but then we have the Lords who are very strong in all areas.  In the last book Amara thinks she sees Attis Aquitaine binding wild furies to himself, it was really just a ruse, but it implies that people can find and bind furies so why over the course of the 10 or so years that the book covered.

We have Amara, Bernard and Isana as main characters that only ever display 1 or 2 areas of Furycraft and display not even a small amount of skill any other area but then we >have the Lords who are very strong in all areas.   From what I understand this is partially genetic. The reason Max has access to more areas is because his father was High Lord Antillus. Same with Tavi and Septimus. There was a chance that both of them could have ended up being less capable due to having less capable mothers but the way the probabilities sorted out gave them the skills of their fathers.   In the last book Amara thinks she sees Attis Aquitaine binding wild furies to himself, it was really just a ruse, but it implies that people can find and bind furies so why over the course of the 10 or so years that the book covered. Why weren't people trying to >'Catch'em All'?   Its stated quite clearly in the book that most of the furies had already been caught in the lands closer to the cities and those furies were only released once citizens died. It would probably take years to recpature them all and the strong crafters in the book were a bit distracted by the vord.  In the Hinterlands I'd assume that the wild furies wouldn't be caught because no crafter strong enough to capture them could be bothered to do so."
Fantasy,3dtaji,Oshi105,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:52 2015 UTC,"It is fully genetic. The laws of the Realm in fact support this, forcing powerful crafters to marry and have children of even more crafting power."

Jim states clearly enough that most of the so called ""civilized lands"" had bound away or though passing down furies reduced the wild furies to tame bits without personalty. It's specifically stated that a great deal of what High Lords etc do is bind the greater furies in their lands for the safety of the land (kalrus and the volcano) and as use as weapons. Majority of folk simply do not have access to those furies. The wild furies the Vord were using were wrested out or broken out from bindings to be used as a weapon. Most likely after Alerens were killed or pushed out allowing them to release the Furies."
Fantasy,3dtaji,Mars445,3,Sun Jul 19 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"Her tiny bit of metalcraft, if she had much, would have been overpowered by the watercrafting. She was an uberpowerful watercrafter. On terms with the strongest Citizens (High Lords) in that one area.   Those Citizens also tend to be equally as powerful in other crafting disciplines such as metalcrafting and have experience using all aspects. So in their case the +100 emotional sense  could be mostly or fully dampened by the -100 emotional sense granted by active metalcrafting. Isana was has that +100 emotional sense and maybe only -1 from metal crafting.  Though to note, apparently metalcrafting is a bit of an oddity among the crafting disciplines. Most do not even know they have it until they serve in the Legions (seen with Schulz in the First Aleran).   It's quite possible, and probable in my opinion considering the social aspects of freeholders on the frontier, that Isana was never exposed to metal a lot (besides basic cooking utensils) and the metalcrafting discipline until she trained with Araris at swordsmanship.  In my opinion it's a combination of the two. She's too powerful for a small amount of metalcrafting to matter compared to the emotions she is exposed to, as well as her never training extensively in other crafting aspects.  Also, she's not alone in her lack of metal crafting. Odiana is the same way in terms of emotions and not being able to block them out unless concentrating."

Fantasy,3dtaji,SonOfOnett,3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"The fieldcraft exams are a recent phenomena. Trying to remember but when it was mentioned in the books Tavi states they were implemented because someone without Furycraft (him) got somewhere he shouldn't have.   As for crafting as a whole in an army setting I would think that the crafting examinations would be more an assessment of what a soldier is capable of. Thus a way to find how to use them best for example the case of Isana. You are correct that she doesn't have the kind of crafting needed to serve in the regular legions. Thus she would have been moved into a position that fit her crafting/skills e.g. healing/medic who rides rather then marches. The tests are likely ways to determine the skills (crafting) of an individual to insure that they were utilized properly. In the case of a marching set of soldiers they would need to be able use the roads. A scout on the other hand would need to be able to communicate properly and move quickly but would likely be moving outside of the roads thus not need earth crafting as much.  The skills a standard legionnaire needs are dictated by what the legions do. March on the roads, fight with weapons in tight quarters and be used to preparing basic camp quarters. It would be unlikely for a standard legion soldier to have any strong aircrafting/woodcrafting/watercraftng. It's more likely anyone with strong skills in those areas would be transferred to specialized parts of the legions as a whole (engineers, archers, and healers etc)."
Fantasy,3dtaji,khaalis,3,Sun Jul 19 13:31:37 2015 UTC,"Fury crafting was very poorly developed in the series in my opinion. It was massively underutilized by non-main characters and didn't really seem to have a major impact on the world. In a world where people can control elements by controlling spirits of the land (or whatever they were, it's been a while, forgive me) one would expect many aspects of people's lives to be different, but they really aren't.   I also have a gripe about the furies aspect of the magic. Even when people did use magic, the furies component wasn't really very important. It could have been any sort of magic, and generally felt very generic. The ""Pokemon"" aspect is MUCH better done in the Eli Monpress series for example.  But hey, I love Jim Butcher's writing more and more with every book, so while I might not love the Furies (the Vord are sweet though) Dresden more than makes up for it"

Fantasy,3dtaji,Daemon_Targaryen,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Furycrafting made perfect sense to me. As far as the Legions go, not all Legionaries had to be proficient in all furies. It's like any form of military. Your field test are a test of aptitude to decide where you get placed in the Legion. If your aptitude was metal you were a front liner. Earth and wood mostly in the engineering corp, etc. the legion excels at using the legionaries' skills to their utmost. As stated by others, not everyone has aptitude in all elements. Additionally it is far more common for country folk to have a strong specialization with one or two events whereas city folk tend to be generalists without a strong aptitude toward any element. However something else to keep in mind is that many feature characters are the Outliers of the norm, that's why they're feature characters. If the story was about every average Tom dick and Harry it wouldn't be much of a story."

After we're introduced to the characters and some emotional backstory, we see what basically amounts to a training montage. Characters train, they suck at first (except Mikasa), but they slowly get better and better until they feel confident enough that they can take down a titan. Then a very shonen (the japanese word for boy but also the genre that AoT falls into) moment happens when the lead character declares that from that day forward, humanity will rise......only to get shown up by the thing that started all of the terror in the first place and have everyone get put in their place. It was that moment where most people saw that this wasn't going to be an easy adventure with smiles and laughs along the way. This was going to be a grizzly and gruesome experience.

If the writer had just stopped writing for 6-12 months and written out the 'big plot' for the anime and then just went on writing the manga as he saw fit, that would've been a best-of-all-worlds situation, but of course that's just not going to happen."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,KibaKiba,4,Sat Jul 18 22:57:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of manga publications are monthly. Jump Square, Bessatsu Shonen (which AoT is published in), a lot of Dengenki magazines, yada yada. He's one chapter a month cause that's just when the magazine comes out. About that ending, I think it's actually better for him to rethink his ""everyone dies"" ending, not just because the series got crazy popular but because he may have just thought of something better along the way. Endings change and I feel like an everyone dies ending is just sort of lazy. Japan is known for their stories not coming out all sunshine in the end, and I'm not even asking for everyone to live, but I think an ending with a little more thought than everyone dies is worth working towards."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,s-mores,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"Oh huh, that's true. Didn't think about that, just got a short rundown from a friend who read the manga when the anime was coming out, and he was a bit peeved that the manga was so slow, maybe the chapters were short or something?  Oh, I don't mind the ending changing, I just would've liked a bit faster-paced anime schedule. It's been what, two years since the anime came out and it left off in a cliffhanger and with half the important characters dead. So now I'm thinking there's a GRRM thing going on where the mangaka kills off the good characters and forgets to write new good ones in their place... or that center politics become more of a thing, ugh."

Fantasy,3dqp1a,Mountebank,7,Sun Jul 19 13:24:53 2015 UTC,"The technical aspects of AoT are notoriously bad. The art is terrible (but gets better) and the pacing and placement of flashbacks are strange. It's clearly the author's first work. Yet, its explosive popularity despite these limitations show how good the ideas are/were (depending on your opinion on how the plot develops later on).  The other comments are right: AoT is exploitative in how bad things gets. It goes out of its way to make things always seem hopeless and terrible. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It depends upon your tolerance for such things.  I recommend you watch the anime instead. Not only does it fix the bad art issue, it also has an amazing soundtrack and it fixes the weird placement of the flashback early on."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,EctMills,4,Sat Jul 18 16:51:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the anime has it's own artistic issues, namely the physics used which are forgivable in a manga and are absolutely absurd when animated.  I found myself thinking in just about every action scene ""wait, what did they tether to?!?""  It makes the least sense in the heavily forested scenes when they are having conversations without the need to re-tether.    Someday a main character will pull a George of the Jungle and I will laugh SO hard."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,s-mores,8,Sat Jul 18 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"Really? If you get past the ""They would actually die during training from the stress and rapid deceleration"" the physics are pretty good, IMO.  As for the discussions in midair, everyone knows that when airborne, anime characters move at the speed of plot. If they need to have a two-hour conversation during one jump, they will."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,EctMills,2,Sat Jul 18 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"Generally for me it was more a problem of what they could possibly be anchoring to.  In the town there were limited buildings tall enough and they mostly seemed to be traveling down a street, so where is the anchor point?  And in the Forrest even if the speed is slowed down they're wizzing past dozens of trees, was this forest planted with lanes?  I'm not saying it has to be 100% realistic, these were just the things that tweaked me while watching."

Fantasy,3dqp1a,burpinator,3,Sun Jul 19 04:02:01 2015 UTC,"After seeing the anime, I tried reading the manga, but sadly the art in the first chapters is just unbearably bad (at least for my taste - and compared to most of the other manga I've read).   Now, I don't have problem with the mangaka's sketchy, somewhat rushed lines, but what mainly irritated me was the shitty anatomy (every second page someone suffered from Squashed Head syndrome) and stilted and awkward looking poses/expressions. Honestly, some of the first chapter pages looked like someone's ""My First Manga!"" project.  That said, it seems to get somewhat better later on. Still very far from the likes of ""Berserk"", though. In fact, just read ""Berserk"" instead!"
Fantasy,3dqp1a,Kongo204,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the manga. A ridiculous amount of characters die, but they never really got enough screen time for me to care. The anime was much better, which is something I don't say very often."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,Agriasoaks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:57:40 2015 UTC,"It's alright. It's not gonna be bad for someones first anime/manga/etc. The artist doesn't really get good at drawing humans for a long time, so things will always look a little bit off for a good while. It's also overly melodramatic, and don't expect it to look much like the movie trailer at all.  If you are looking for fantasy anime/manga there are much better candidates in my opinion, but I would have to say if you're looking for something very basic attack on titans will be good for a first timer."

Fantasy,3dqp1a,Arsestolemyname,7,Sun Jul 19 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"E: Shift apparently submits. Added my entire submission.   Attack on titan carries almost no character development. It's more of a story of a place than a set of characters. The series takes a slow twist from action into politics later. It's very over the top and can seem extremely dramatic at times for things that don't deserve the screentime. There are way too many speech scenes.   That being said, the concept itself is hard to dislike, and the action itself is amazing. Definitely worth your time to anybody who isn't looking to have their mind blown by a complex story but still looking for something refreshingly new."

Fantasy,3dqp1a,PeterAhlstrom,8,Sat Jul 18 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty terrible and formulaic.  The writer tries to keep reminding you how bad of a place humans are in by introducing characters, and giving them some backstory, only to off them for cheap feels. This process takes an incredibly long time, and brings in some major pacing issues for the main story arc.  What's worse is every time one of these characters die, the main characters act like they were just again reminded how terrible the world is.  I'm not saying you'd get used to losing friends, but after a few hundred years of constant attacks and deaths, societies skin would be a little thicker.  Especially for the people in the main cast, who knowingly joined the branch of the army that has the highest mortality rate."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,AugustK2014,2,Sat Jul 18 16:18:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love the manga. The first episode of the anime was too gory for us (some things are just too much in live action or animated form), but later I started reading the manga (via Crunchyroll manga) and am up to date.  There are chapters that make me gasp out loud from the audacity of it all. But more than that, I really enjoy the story.  The art leaves something to be desired especially toward the beginning of the series. Body proportions are sometimes a bit off (and I'm talking about the normal humans). But the art does get better as the series develops."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,IdlePigeon,2,Sat Jul 18 18:08:01 2015 UTC,"Fair warning, if you're sensitive to the uncanny valley you might want to proceed slowly.  Honestly I found the AoT story to be nothing special, but that dude put his finger right on ""physically repellent"" when he created the titans.  Everything about them makes me want to puke.  Their dead eyes, deformed limbs, overlarge mouths with too many teeth that are too small... eugh.  Just thinking about it makes me want to barf."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,FifteenthPen,2,Sun Jul 19 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"I only read the first volume, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but all I could think reading Attack on Titan was ""Wow, this series really wants to be Evangelion and it's failing pretty hard."""

Fantasy,3dqp1a,Hergrim,5,Sat Jul 18 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the translation of the title is unfortunate, the original ""Shingeki no Kyojin"", is more literally something like ""Advancing Giant"", but ""Attack on Titan"" is the original english subtitle given by the original author, so that's what they went with.  (StackExchange question on the subject)  I enjoyed the show, but I was a tiny bit disappointed when I discovered it wasn't a sci-fi revolving around the moon of Saturn, honestly."
Fantasy,3dqp1a,8nate,4,Sat Jul 18 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it's a literal translation, as Japanese has few plural forms of nouns. So, the title is literally ""Attack on Titan"", but would probably be more accurate if it was, as you suggest, ""Attack on the Titans"". That doesn't roll off the tongue so well, though, so I suspect that it's a deliberate ""bad"" translation."

I bulled my way through almost to the end because I liked the premise and I liked how things were subverted following the training montage, but the pacing is just so bad and it has such a large number of monologues that ruin the tension that has been building up to that moment that my interest slipped. Then there was the interminable recapping and overblown emoting.  What really sealed the coffin for me was the pathetic defences thrown up after the first Titan attack. Really? You're going to only put two ditches barely two Titans in width and not even a 15 metre Titan in depth between you and the gate? You're just going to leave the cannons sitting out there in the open instead of building an earthen wall and mounting cannons in protected pillboxes? You're not digging a large moat around the other gate and surrounding that with a series of earth and stone walls containing baffled gates to prevent the Armoured Titan from building up momentum? Seriously?"

The over-emoting shit didn't really matter to me in either format. I watch Anime. It often shows up. It's just a thing that sometimes happens. I'm used to it. (But yeah, they tend to overdo it...)  Anyway, I read this review here.  It actually convinced me to give the series a third try. I like the setting in general but don't much care for the approach but an entirely new, do whatever and we'll make it Horror approach? I'm sold."
