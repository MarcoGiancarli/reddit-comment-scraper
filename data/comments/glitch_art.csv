The Shape's expansion is now so fast that attempts to stop it have been completely overtaken and have resulted in, at the time of this report, 42 tragic deaths. At this moment, The Shape has completely engulfed the city of San Francisco, but its consumption seems only to be accelerating, and is travelling outward in every direction. Scientists estimate the size of The Shape to be doubling approximately every 42 hours, and caution that anyone hearing a distant, incessant sound of crinkling paper is in the danger zone. Citizens are advised to immediately get underground with whatever supplies they can carry, and wait for further instructions. The authorities are urging anyone within 42 miles of the danger zone to act quickly, but calmly, to avoid being consumed by what the world community has, grimly, dubbed ""The Polycaust.""

I can't recall all of the algorithms I ended up applying on this, but basically from what I recall:   Take original image A Copy it to image B ""glitch up"" image B, this is done by shifting random rows of pixels to the right or to the left  rotate image B by 90c, apply previous step again rotate image B back move image B 100 pixels to the left copy image A to image C Glitch up image C same way as image B Move image C 100 pixels to the right Iterated over every pixel in image C and increase the green value by 30 Open pattern A (a simple black and white pattern, taken from this link posted in the same subreddit before: http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/13/8919677/early-computer-art-computers-and-automation) Resize pattern A to the exact size of images A, B, and C iterate over every pixel in pattern A. If the pixel is dark  (pixel's R + G + B values smaller than 100), take the coordinates of the pixel and darken (reduce pixel's R G and B values by 50) the pixels in the same coordinates in image B and C Iterate over the every pixel in original image A. For every pixel N apply: if in the same coordinates of pixel N in image C contain a light pixel, replace pixel N with the one in image C. If not AND pixel N is dark, replace pixel N with the one in image C in the same coordinates.   Writing it down I understand it's pretty confusing.

glitch_art,3d0wb6,NaT3z,2,Mon Jul 13 03:27:42 2015 UTC,"I'm using it as a mix of the Wordpad effect and a hex editor. I open up the image with Notepad++ and start manually inputting bits of data (or even removing or altering). There are certain patterns you start to recognize to kinda have some control over how the image is going to end up, but sometimes it's kinda random. It mostly changes the colours to some shade of green or red and chops/scrambles it up.  I'm not so good at Photoshop, so for example in this image I just used it to mirror the pic and make it horizontal. If you were to chop it up the middle and make it vertical, that's how the original image with only Notepad++ treatment would be. Maybe drop in a filter or two but I try not to go crazy with that. As you said, this could be easily replicated in Photoshop (and probably more quickly and efficiently), but what's the fun in that? For me, it's more about the process than the result. I just listen to some chill tunes, maybe get a coffe and just start tinkering with bits and pixels.  EDIT: I also use a mix of Photoshop and taking pictures of my computer monitor to give my pics some pixelation and jpeg artifacts, just because I enjoy the look of those things. I'm now experimenting with digital photography feedback and artifacting when you take pics of monitors and TV's.

We just rolled them out so it's good to see you and so many others following them.   The only thing I'd say is that next time try to use the square brackets [These].  No big deal, just trying to keep everything uniform.  Thanks, and keep posting!"

glitch_art,3d1d11,sackopuppies,2,Sun Jul 12 19:33:11 2015 UTC,Looks great. I never thought about combining double exposure and glitch. Gotta go try that now. Thanks :)
glitch_art,3d1rd3,a9s,2,Sun Jul 12 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"I got frustrated with trying to fix this image in Processing (imgur's compression makes the problematic pixels invisible) and tried to translate it to JavaScript. Here I thought there was a problem with the HSV->RGB algorithm, the only thing it doesn't have in common with the Processing implementation. There wasn't."

glitch_art,3d1fq3,aphexmandelbrot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:02:54 2015 UTC,Did you write the script in processing for this yourself?
glitch_art,3d1fq3,hipnosister,2,Sun Jul 12 19:52:26 2015 UTC,Could you provide some links to some of the interesting github projects?

Starting the other day, we rolled out new rules and posting guidelines, so in the future please make sure to follow them.  Don't worry about today, as these only came into effect on Thursday, but if you want to remove your post and resubmit with the right tags it would definitely help get the ball rolling.  Thanks again and keep posting!"

glitch_art,3d17qu,6sweet6leaf6,3,Mon Jul 13 03:44:16 2015 UTC,It's a programming language
