I found Inceptus to be a very palatable and enjoyable sour.  It's something that could win over people who may be a bit uncertain about sours while still appealing to the converted.  A Night on Brett, on the other hand, was a truly funky, citrusy experience, and I loved every bit of that brash beer.  Nice to meet you this past weekend, Jarrett.  Congratulations on such a successful event, and cheers to everyone at Three Taverns!"

atlbeer,3dm95i,blakeleywood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"If it stays on the shelf until after 07-04-16 I'll buy one but I don't appreciate a brewery who sells a beer that isn't ready (in some markets they were selling them before 07-04-15, which is the earliest Stone recommended one drink it) and then make that lack of readiness a marketing gimmick."

Hop City in Krog has Ballast Point Habanero Sculpin on tap.  I know it isn't local, but this stuff is incredible.  It's like a Monday Night Serrano Eye Patch, but it actually kicks your ass with pepper flavor and burn."

I personally haven't been to the brewery but my friends have and say it's still a good your with tickets for tasting.  There's coastal empire brewery too but I'm not a huge fan of their beers.

atlbeer,3dke5j,EagleBoro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:31:34 2015 UTC,Yes totally forgot to mention moon river. They only have their beers locally as in their location and a few other bars around town have some of theirs on tap. Aberration ale is my fav.
atlbeer,3dke5j,BGFreak99,3,Fri Jul 17 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"You have Southbound, Service, Coastal Empire, and Moon River brew pub for breweries. All but Coastal are within walking distance to each other. Could easily park near River Street, hit up Southbound (recommend) and Service, then head to Moon River for dinner and more drinks.  Coastal has recently been making some awesome beer (not the cans you see everywhere). Their hours are a little weird (open like once a month). Check out their site or call them to see if they'll be giving tours this weekend.  The Distillery and Crystal Beer Parlor aren't breweries or brew pubs, but they always have an EXCELLENT tap list as well as good food.  Your best bet for a beer store is Habersham Beverage. They have two locations. The one on Abercorn in the Best Buy shopping center is the biggest and best.  Savannah is all about drinking."

If you were to only hit up a could spots, I'd recommend Southbound and Moon River. Good beer, good food, and both close to each other.  If you want to try to find Coastal's limited release beers (or any other Savannah brew to take home), try Habersham. Coastal's Dawn Patrol Breakfast Stout is such a great beer. Also recently had a collaboration with Burnt Hickory called March to the Sea. Might be able to find either at Habersham.  Just moved from Savannah. Pretty decent beer scene."

atlbeer,3dke5j,ultimatesideboob,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:44 2015 UTC,Habersham Beverage is your answer. Also highly recommend Green Truck Pub.

atlbeer,3dkp80,bonerkebab,2,Fri Jul 17 01:28:11 2015 UTC,Thoughts?  I think this means that eventually we will see FW on the shelves around Ga. I love me some FW. Their brewery was amazing.
atlbeer,3dkp80,Velvet_Buddah,2,Fri Jul 17 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"Their BA series are some of the few beers I'll spend the $$$ to get off trades. FW knows what their doing, and the craft brewers Duvel owns (Boulevard & Ommegang) both put out awesome beers. I think this could be a big positive for them."
atlbeer,3dkp80,Velvet_Buddah,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:44:50 2015 UTC,I feel the same with regards to Duvel and yes I will pay the extra for trades or buying their mainstays from places that ship beer. I loaded up with their stuff last October at the brewery. I didn't realize it but I have accumulated a 3 year vertical of parabola so now I try for 5 year before drinking them
atlbeer,3dkp80,Velvet_Buddah,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:52 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. Parabola is incredible, but it's actually my least favorite of the Reserve series, which says a lot."

I have had a few of their other reserves when I visited the brewery last October

If you want to take stuff home Bottleworks and Chuck's Hop Shop are both good stops.  Whole Foods out there will sometimes have some good gems too.  Edit: both Bottleworks and Chuck's hop shop allow in store consumption and sometimes have some pretty good locals on tap too.  So you can drink while you browse.  :)

You also get to talk to some great brewers and try their beer, which is always fun.

Grapefruit Sculpin is good as well, and it's widely available. And finally Victory Dirt Wolf, though it's pretty earthy and piney too so that might not be what you're after."

atlbeer,3d4js2,southernbeertours,2,Mon Jul 13 14:08:22 2015 UTC,That's shocking to me that Sweetwater 420 would be more likely than Bud Light. I would have guessed that Bud Light is on the menu at 90+% of bars.  Perhaps it's because lots of dives don't even have a beer menu or a website that lists beers.

That's the attitude I was speaking on in general.

atlbeer,3cv801,HunaTopper,2,Sat Jul 11 04:22:51 2015 UTC,"CC,BHB, and Orpheus are blowing up. 3 Taverns and Wild Heaven are killing Belgian stuff IMO. Future is bright in the GA ! Wrecking Bar is an elite brewpub with killer food to boot."
atlbeer,3cv801,bravodawg,2,Sat Jul 11 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between what I would consider to be the best beer produced and what I would consider to be my favorites. My favorites go as follows:   Creature Comforts - Tropicalia and Athena are two of the best beers in GA if not the best. I got to try Tritonia the other day and it was also fantastic. Terrapin - I'm a huge fan of Rec Ale (if you didn't know already) and I think Wake & Bake is top five best beers in GA. They put out very palatable interesting beers.  Orpheus - Transmigration, Peace. War. Truth. Lie, & Serpent Bite are all top notch beers. I also love their brewery. Sweetwater - A year or two ago they would have been my number one but business practices and a few other factors have made me take a step back lately. I still drink a whole lot of 420, their IPA is one of the best in the state, Hop Hash is unique and very tasty, and Happy Ending is another one of my favorite stouts. Burnt Hickory - I don't get to drink as much as I'd like so they're not as go to as some others. Consistent quality beer in all of their styles makes this brewery one of if not the best in GA.  Red Brick - I'm a sucker for their IPA and Session IPA. It also helps that all the dudes that work there are awesome.  Eventide - Their Pale Ale is one of my favorites. Red Headed Haley is pretty tasty as well and I like their business model of DIY."
atlbeer,3cv801,daebat,2,Sat Jul 11 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"No order: creature comforts, Orpheus, BHB, wild heaven, wrecking bar, 3 taverns... Ehh, not sure on the last one. I'd love to put MAZURT (hello, are you there?)... I'd normally put terrapin because I actually enjoy moohoo and liquid bliss (so sue me), but their recent release have been a huge disappointment. I may be putting Sweetwater soon, depending on how corked and caged turns out. Their IPA and EPA are both alright.   Edit: the 7th may be twains, I went once but haven't been in a long time. I don't remember anything absolutely flooring me, but I remember them being pretty good."

I know they are often better than what they release and I want them to be one of my tops, like they used to be. i like the ideas. Just seems like rushed execution."

atlbeer,3cv801,HunaTopper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:57:32 2015 UTC,How much do they own? How many board seats do they have? What do they do day-to-day at the brewery?
atlbeer,3cv801,HunaTopper,-3,Sat Jul 11 04:19:10 2015 UTC,"Miller Coors purchasing stock in terrapin alleviated some debt and allowed to expand their production to make more beers like their deliciously adjunct flavored Liquid Lunch (sarcasm). While Miller Coors may be a minority stock holder it's still a sell out nonetheless. Plenty of breweries succeed without selling out. It's this brilliant idea of making good beer that people like. Crazy right? BHB is a prime example. So the fact terrapin had to sell out in order to accomplish this, I'd say they don't deserve a spot here but that's just me. But if you want to enjoy your warm kept terrapin by all means, don't let me stop you. I'll take my business elsewhere though in an effort to avoid supporting InBev, Miller Coors, ect."

atlbeer,3cv801,HunaTopper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:36:00 2015 UTC,MillerCoors bought 33% share of Terrapin originally.  Terrapin has since purchased them down to 24% so they still qualify as a craft brewery according to The Craft Guild.  Basically MillerCoors saved them with an influx of cash so they didn't go under a few years ago.
atlbeer,3cv801,seabaugh,3,Sat Jul 11 07:06:26 2015 UTC,"I know all the answers to these questions. I was being facetious. But now you're just spreading misinformation.    MillerCoors bought 33% share of Terrapin originally. Terrapin has since purchased them down to 24% so they still qualify as a craft brewery according to The Craft Guild.   Source for that?  It's always been a few points under 25%  http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2011-10-17/terrapin-brewery-selling-minority-interest-miller-coors-craft-beer-division   “We’re not disclosing what percentage it is, but it’s less than 25 percent,” he said. “And it’s not like 24.9 percent. It’s well below that.” -John Cochran   Oh also -- The Craft Guild is not a thing.  It's the Brewer's Association.    Basically MillerCoors saved them with an influx of cash so they didn't go under a few years ago.   DEFINITELY going to need a source for that.  Terrapin wasn't just sitting on shelves in 2011 unable to pay their debts. Converting debt to equity with a large investor no doubt allows them to spend money on expansion, but by no means were they facing closing the doors.  Those are the facts.  There are many reports from people inside of Terrapin (if Reddit's search feature didn't suck so much i'd go find them) that say Tenth & Blake has one seat on the board of directors.  Even assuming there are only 3 seats and John and Spike hold the other two... you're still looking at minority board control. 10th and Blake has at most (but almost certainly much less than) 33% board control.  Meaning they have no real voting power over the original ownership in things like recipe formulation, where the company will roll out, who it hires, etc."

Regarding your question, I do think the events and releases posting are useful.  However, much of the release information is for past releases, whereas I suspect most people tend to be more interested in upcoming releases. Just wondering if that has something to do with a lack of upvotes, but it is a useful compilation.  Also, there seems to be a disconnection between what is being released/events beers and what people are actually drinking.  Nothing wrong with that at all, and it probably is reality for most.  I often will buy a beer and not get around to it for a couple of weeks."

I'd favor the idea of an upcoming releases thread, but you are correct that it's difficult to say precisely when certain beers will make into stores.  Then there are beers that we anticipate for a long time and then just appear out of nowhere, like Coastal Empire Dawn Patrol did a week or two ago.  Speaking of which, I enjoyed Dawn Patrol a few days ago, and let me tell you that it's an outstanding beer.  Very different flavor profile from the likes of Mexican Cake--more of a mole sauce.  Lots of cumin and roasted red pepper with just a hint of bittersweet chocolate to counterbalance.  If that sounds enticing, then Coastal Empire killed it with that beer."

atlbeer,3ctcgt,brianhewitt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:09 2015 UTC,I wish I was going to be in town for this. Someone save me a growler.
atlbeer,3cqe13,Shufflapagus,12,Thu Jul 9 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what has been said already.  IMO it's just that they don't ""wow"" some people and so they don't think highly of them.  Of all the beer I've tried in GA I've only had a couple that I would consider bad beers, but some are just average - and there's nothing wrong with that.  Every time I go to Red Hare it's packed so there are obviously a lot of people that like their beer.  Not to mention they are in the process of a big expansion so they are obviously selling plenty of it.  I hope folks can remember that there is an actual person behind these beers and no matter what others think the brewers are putting a lot into making a product they believe in and offering it up to the public.  There's nothing at all wrong with saying you don't like a beer or even a certain brewery, but I hope on here we can try to not take that to the level of just bashing them.  I'd like to see all the breweries come to this sub to share info, but hateful comments will discourage them from posting."
atlbeer,3cqe13,itsme_timd,6,Fri Jul 10 01:48:42 2015 UTC,"There is one other factor at play that I haven't seen mentioned (though I may have missed it).  I'm not sure how many of people here were around the craft beer scene when Red Hare launched, and had their initial batches. I knew the manager at the Decatur Taco Mac at the time, and they got one of the first batches of the Red Hare IPA when they launched. A few buddies and I were curious about it, so we gathered at the bar to give it a shot.   It was awful. Thin, very minimal hops, completely lacking in complexity. It tasted like a pale ale, not an IPA, and a bad pale ale, at that. Soon, we learned they rushed it to market before it was really ready, but I can tell you from conversations I've had with lots of people, they lost a sizable chunk of the Atlanta beer community when they did that.   Of course, most people who aren't craft beer geeks either didn't taste that initial batch, or didn't really have the experience to understand why it was bad. So they don't care. But that move still colors many people's perception of them.   Also, I've tried the IPA a couple of times since then. It's not as bad as that first time, but I still find it to be a fairly poor effort. I did think their Sticky Stout was pretty solid, though."
atlbeer,3cqe13,shiftysquid,3,Fri Jul 10 13:11:53 2015 UTC,"Sticky Stout and Long Day are the only Red Hare selections I've been able to drink more than one of, to be perfectly honest."
atlbeer,3cqe13,LoveChildNumberNine,2,Fri Jul 10 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I've had Sticky Stout twice now. It's a nice, drinkable stout. Not something I'd drink all the time, but there's nothing wrong with it at all. In fact, I think it could be a pretty good introduction to the stout style, almost a ""stout for those who don't like stouts.""  Long Day ... Well, I'll say I don't tend to like lagers, so that one didn't really have a chance with me. If you like it, cheers to that."
atlbeer,3cqe13,shiftysquid,5,Fri Jul 10 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"So I feel that beer, in the subjective sense is either ""loved it or hated it"" or you think ""it's okay"" I think that if you go too extreme you'll alienate the average consumer.   Imagine when you had your first Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It was WAAYYY too hoppy. Now it seems like Child's play. Enjoying craft beer is a journey, and the only way is similar to training for a marathon when you've never ran. Start slow, begin to jog, and then run. Everyone (myself included), forgets sometimes the gateway beers that really made you enjoy craft beer.   You can sip nostalgically, but you'll wonder why that particular beer made you have a paradigm shift and see beer as a whole a new, frightening Dreamscape."

atlbeer,3cqe13,underscorex,3,Fri Jul 10 12:48:26 2015 UTC,Do people really drink long day lager who arent paid to do so?
atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,3,Fri Jul 10 13:01:14 2015 UTC,"Red Hare is my go-to beer at Costco. It's relatively cheap ($26 for 24 cans), has four different cans in each 12-pack, and I like all of them. I wouldn't call any of them my favorite beer, but I don't need my favorite beer all the time."
atlbeer,3cqe13,OccasionallyWright,4,Fri Jul 10 14:17:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this point. A couple of people have said things like ""their only aim in life is to make meh beer"" and I bet if you asked the guys who work at Red Hare, they'd get pretty offended.  I don't agree with some of the comments on here, but I can understand why people would consider them an intro to craft beer. I just happen to like their stuff, and wanted to know if the community really dislikes them or something. I'm not sure I agree with the sentiment that everyone needs to be making the most groundbreaking, top tier stuff, because someone has to be part of the market that introduces new drinkers to craft beer."
atlbeer,3cqe13,KrakowKid,3,Fri Jul 10 18:03:51 2015 UTC,I agree with most of the posts on here...overall there is a lot we can all agree on. Most of you guys were spot on.
atlbeer,3cqe13,LeRoytheAlien,22,Fri Jul 10 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"From what I've noticed, breweries like Red Hare and Monday Night don't seem to focus entirely on pushing boundaries of taste, but rather making widely approachable beer with mass appeal. I've always thought that Red Hare's beer is decent, drinkable (especially Cotton Tail Pale and Whabbit Wheat) but not EXTREME, which can lead to a lot of negative opinions from so-called ""snobs"" who only want breweries that make sours, DIPAs, and Barrel-Aged Stouts. One of the guys from Monday Night specifically said, during a tour, that their mission was to make ""craft beer for non-craft people"" and I think Red Hare does the exact same thing, spectacularly.  I personally wouldn't be surprised if Red Hare or Monday Night end up giving SweetWater and Terrapin a run for their money in 5-10 years."
atlbeer,3cqe13,DoctorPnut,7,Thu Jul 9 23:27:58 2015 UTC,I agree. I think BHB gets a ton of attention for the beers they are making (for good reason) but the big beers and special releases aren't for every day consumption unless you have a spare liver sitting around.
atlbeer,3cqe13,daebat,3,Thu Jul 9 23:39:13 2015 UTC,This is a great way of putting it. I'm a big fan of their IPA but I wouldn't say it's remarkable or anything. I also don't think they're trying for it to be.
atlbeer,3cqe13,LoveChildNumberNine,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:57:30 2015 UTC,You think they're NOT trying to make a remarkable IPA?
atlbeer,3cqe13,daebat,3,Fri Jul 10 12:24:27 2015 UTC,"I think if you asked them if they're trying to make a decent local ipa to compete with SW IPA, Red Brick IPA, Monday Night IPA, they'd agree. They're not trying to create a Hop Drop & Roll or Pliny."
atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,0,Fri Jul 10 12:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, you cant criticize our beer because were not trying to make anything good."
atlbeer,3cqe13,daebat,2,Fri Jul 10 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, getting defensive :) Nobody said you can't criticize beer and nobody said they're not trying to make anything good. My comment was about their IPA and whether or not I thought their goal was to make the #1 ipa in the country."
atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:41:48 2015 UTC,Im just saying its a cop-out for a brewery to be immune from criticism because they werent trying to impress you. I dont understand why you wouldnt try to make the #1 ipa in the country. People need to advance the industry and not languish in the  percentile where 3000 other breweries already exist.
atlbeer,3cqe13,daebat,3,Fri Jul 10 19:00:16 2015 UTC,Well then you just don't understand the beer business. If you can't admit that average ipas are a niche or that there's no money in it then we're done here.
atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"I think they were more of a niche before people started making good ipas. Its been a looooong time since I've seen a red hare handle in the inman park/east Atlanta village/ Decatur area. They're not making any money on all those handles they don't have.  Its only a matter of time before this brewery has to get into the pay to play model along with goose island, magic hat and widmer."
atlbeer,3cqe13,daebat,2,Fri Jul 10 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, since then they've shown up in almost every grocery store and beer store in town with an increasing number of canned product. Stick to creating one day old reddit accounts to talk smack on and let the big boys handle the business side."
atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,3,Fri Jul 10 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"this is silly, Monday Night has done plenty of barrel aging, even has a GABF Gold Medal for it. They also just released a wine barrel aged sour beer, which is quality."
atlbeer,3cqe13,LeRoytheAlien,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:26:18 2015 UTC,"I did say they don't focus 'entirely' on pushing the boundaries of taste. But I get what you're saying, and thank you for it.  I never said they don't do delicious sours and barrel-aged beers and one-offs. To clarify I think of them as a great brewery with a good variety of brews, and a helluva personality. Every time I go there I feel like I'm part of their family, and I can always find something different and fun to try."
atlbeer,3cqe13,underscorex,2,Sat Jul 11 04:38:55 2015 UTC,"This is the deal.  BHB is great and all, but they're catering to Beer People.  Red Hare and Monday Night are making much more approachable beers.  I wouldn't bother giving a bomber of Big Shanty to my brother, he'd be like ""what the fuck is this?"" and try to sink it.  But he'd drink the hell out of Nerd Alert or Eye Patch."

atlbeer,3cqe13,underscorex,6,Fri Jul 10 04:04:55 2015 UTC,I disagree. You'd be hard pressed to find a better tailgate beer than Athena.
atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,7,Fri Jul 10 04:11:29 2015 UTC,"Man, you know what I mean - accessible beers.  Some people just don't like IPAs, you know?  Or, not everything has to be some sort of gonzo experimental flavor profile.  But anyway, I think Red Hare in particular catches flak because they had the same three beers available at retail for a couple years now, and they aren't seen as doing much else.  EDIT TO ADD - I don't think Athena is a bad tailgate beer, either.  But something like, say BHB's Didjits?  That's going to blow the minds of people who don't get much crazier than Sam Adams, you know?  There has to be a... leveling, I guess?  You don't go straight from Bud Light stolen from your friend's dad's house to DIPAs."
atlbeer,3cqe13,underscorex,5,Fri Jul 10 11:13:08 2015 UTC,"Tropicalia is the perfect tailgate beer, so is Emergency Drinking Beer."

atlbeer,3cqe13,underscorex,2,Sat Jul 11 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"I'd pit Zeke's wheel against any solid everyday beer though, that's BHB's appeal, it has an everyman(or woman) beer. That said I agree it has more appeal to a craft beer person than anyone else, but you can find something for everyone there too if you're looking. Not so for RH or MN."
atlbeer,3cqe13,ohhbacon,5,Fri Jul 10 12:42:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know that BHB is the fairest of comparisons here - there's an entire other thread about how their lineup is basically a murderer's row right now.    Most breweries don't have the killer lineup they do.  RH doesn't do anything spectacular, but they're not awful.  It's decent, drinkable beer that you can run in and pick up at Kroger (or even some finer gas stations) and take to a cookout and nobody's going to be turned off.  Looking at this thread, you'd think they were making Zima and Mango-Ritas."
atlbeer,3cqe13,underscorex,3,Fri Jul 10 12:51:33 2015 UTC,"It's not a fair comparison, that's true. It is a great example of how a brewery can make beer that anyone can like though without pandering to any particular group. I don't think it's wrong for other breweries to strive for that."

atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,3,Sat Jul 11 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"This nails it.    They are a small brewery making craft beer for the masses.  If Red Hare opened up years later, I doubt they would have been nearly as successful.  But they got in relatively early and have a pretty strong hold on the new craft beer drinkers, or people who just want to drink local beer.  Their beer has truly gotten a bit better over the last few years, between that and some of the newer breweries in the state they have far from the worst beer in town.    I'd rather drink Gangway and Long Day than anything hoppy or lager-ish i've had from some of the new Georgia breweries that everyone loves to pat on the back."

atlbeer,3cqe13,itsme_timd,5,Sat Jul 11 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"Anybody can make a decent brown or a pale ale. What are you doing to separate yourself from the others?. While I never have had anything that I thought was bad from them, I also have never had anything that I would consider exceptional either. I can think of 3 or 4 other local breweries where I can't wait to try anything they put out. My top 3 locals are burnt hickory, creature comforts and Orpheus. In that order"
atlbeer,3cqe13,r_slash,2,Fri Jul 10 23:49:30 2015 UTC,"What are you doing to separate yourself from the others?   This isn't the goal of every brewery.  I talked to the guys at Strawn and they said they have no interest in doing the one-off, soured, fruited, barrel-aged type beers; they just want to make beer that the Average Joe likes to drink.  Seems to me Red Hare falls in between there somewhere.  They've got some basic core beers and occasionally do something a little different.  Seems to be working pretty well for them."
atlbeer,3cqe13,dontdrinklocal,3,Fri Jul 10 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"You don't have to make a ""one-off, soured, fruited, barrel-aged type beer"" to be successful but you do have to give people a reason to buy your product. That reason can be price, or it can be novelty, or quality, or maybe something else I haven't thought of. But if Average Joe has a lager he already likes to buy, he's not going to change brands to Long Day Lager (for example) unless you give him a reason to do so.  So, in a sense, you do have to separate yourself from the others, but that usually doesn't mean brewing unusual or extreme beers."
atlbeer,3cqe13,r_slash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:52:20 2015 UTC,"You do have to make well made beers to be respected by the industry. Thats essentially what this thread is about, do you respect Red Hare? Coming up with the Olive Garden of beers doesn't get my respect even if its geared towards the Average Joe. Average Joe isnt even a craft drinker, he may be a support local drinker, but I would argue those are 2 different things now."
atlbeer,3cqe13,LoveChildNumberNine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:50:42 2015 UTC,"I can't really recall ever drinking Red Hare so I don't have an opinion on them specifically. Just saying that you don't have to go to extremes to be worthy of respect. Just deliver something to customers that gives them a reason to buy it.  I don't think they're striving to be the Olive Garden of beers. I think they're striving to be Shake Shack or Farm Burger (or Chipotle), where Bud is McDonald's (or Taco Bell). Unpretentious but good quality. Not pushing the limits, giving people a good version of something they already like."
atlbeer,3cqe13,radicalpants1,2,Fri Jul 10 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"But there is so, so, so much beer for the Average Joe already. This line of thinking makes absolutely no sense on the part of a brewery."

Any brewery can pop up and fill in that 'who gives a crap' niche, if you even call that a niche.   Nobody is screaming ""Sweet! here comes an American Wheat Seasonal!"" and thats probably a bad thing for brand building.

I don't think that's fair, nor makes good business sense.     I would however agree with you if your position was that they are doomed among beer aficionados that have advanced pallets.  Meaning, very few people in this subreddit will be buying RH (as seems to be the general consensus with this crowd).    Also, to be fair, I tried RH for a little & sampled all of their products.

Some folks want to drink decent, but not challenging beer, made locally.  That is the ecological niche for a Red Hare.  Solid, drinkable, everyday beer, made locally.    Some nights when I'm getting home from work and cooking dinner, I don't want a 10.2% barrel-aged imperial whatever or a crazy-hoppy IPA, I just want a regular old lager to enjoy with my meal, and if I have my druthers, I'd rather have a beer that's local."

They are boring. I don't care for boring and all the other beer nuts that I know share the same opinion. Boring is not what the craft beer scene is about. If you want something basic, there are plenty of non craft options that would be right up your alley. Unfortunately for red hare, they do nothing to separate themselves from anyone else in the craft market. Therefore, when I am looking for a basic brown or lager or whatever, I am just as likely to grab from any local brewery as I am them b/c anybody can make those styles of beers relatively tasty. On another note, farm to table has absolutely nothing to do with this. That is all about where the ingredients are sourced.  Has nothing to do with where it's made."

That's sort of telling right there...   Further, I have yet to see a great example of a Marzen brewed in our local market.  Red Hare brews a very good one in Hasenpfeffer Oktoberfest, but no one really seems to know about it or acknowledge it.  Perhaps that will finally change when it comes to cans this fall.  This thread has gotten a bit out of hand, and I hope that people will note some of the observations that /u/itsme_timd offered early on.

atlbeer,3cqe13,mondrarytomic,7,Fri Jul 10 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"For me Red Hare is absolutely forgettable and sub par. I think they're simple, both in complexity in beer and their branding. One thing I've noticed of all these breweries started by homebrewers is that they still after several years, brew homebrewey beers. They aim for a C+. Their goal in life is to make ""meh, they'll drink it"". Red Hares Long Day Lager tastes like boiled peanut water and west coast hops and they call it a Bohemian Pilsner. Might as well drop trow on deuce on 150 years of brewing tradition. My Day seems longer every time I have one of these in front me. Gangway is ok for an IPA they do a good job keeping it fresh but there's 3500 breweries now who also make an 'ok' ipa. Some breweries in GA are brewing great IPAs and I'd rather have those every chance I get, aroma. I'm glad you love Watershit Brown ale, I think its terribly unbalanced and is a terrible frankenstein of a beer I'm almost never in the mood for. National Common is alright but again Anchor Steam is better and its been around for over 100 years. This failure of breweries who exist only to copy existing beers annoys me and their failure to improve on them in any way makes me wonder why they even try in the first place? Their one offs irk me as well. You're going to make a tequila aged beer and the tequila you choose is Jose freakin Cuervo? Is that even considered tequila? I drank a bottle and my reaction was exactly ""Hey thats a beer that tastes like terrible college nights I wish I forgot about forever.""  Red Hare offers nothing to the craft beer world other than being local to Marietta, to me, that's not enough(if I lived in Marietta maybe I'd feel different) Their tasting room is fun, its gotta be the only fun thing to do in the burbs, other than killing yourself slowly with fast food.  Everyone is very nice who I've met from the company. One of their owners also works for their distributor which I'm sure is a little bit illegal."

atlbeer,3cqe13,nickpurdy,5,Fri Jul 10 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"I'm reading a lot of people commenting and comparing Monday Night and Red Hare. I personally wouldn't put them in the same category of quality at all. Monday Night produces a very consistent product and they have the best year-round Scotch Ale being produced in Georgia.  Unfortunately i have to agree with those that think Red Hare is down right awful.  There only remotely drinkable beer is the Brown, and even it taste different each time i drink it.  I go to the brewery for a tour once every 4-5 months to see if they'll wow me with a special taproom offering and the last time i was there they we're offering a Wheat that was a straight up Diacetyl bomb.  In general, all the breweries in Georgia have niches that are either ""snob centric"" or ""mainstream centric"".   The smart breweries are currently trying to reach out to both demographics. As examples:  Wild Heaven (Civilization vs. Emergency Drinking Beer) Three Taverns (Quasimodo vs. A Night on Ponce)  But, i think both of these breweries are reaching a point where they will be forced economically to decide what they want to be.  Three Taverns continues to call itself a Belgian Inspired brewery but if you look at what they are producing in quantity it is moving completely away from that inspiration. Similar scenario for Wild Heaven who's English inspirations are going to clash with Emergency Drinking Beer.   Unfortunately, I think economics is going to get the best of some of the ""worst"" breweries and some the ""best"" breweries if the laws don't improve in the next few years. Not to mention i think a lot of us ""snobs"" are going to see the snob centric beers disappear because the breweries just won't be able to justify their production."
atlbeer,3cqe13,KrakowKid,4,Fri Jul 10 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"Little bit of horse's mouth here: Our inspirations have never been English, though Ode To Mercy sort of starts from the English brown concept. We'd certainly claim European-inspired, and due to Invocation & Eschaton being two of our first beers, some lumped us into the Belgian-inspired category, which was never the target either. As far as whether or not it makes sense to go high/low like we recently have (Height of Civilization, a tequila-barrel aged barleywine, was released the week before Emergency Drinking Beer cans, and our Dionysus Cuvee came out yesterday, while we'll be canning a double batch of EDB all weekend) portends a future either/or choice, I know we'd beg to differ on that. We can talk more about this during the AmA later this month."

Most of these comments are accurate, they make generic styles that appeal to the masses and non craft beer drinkers...but so does Miller Coors...Given more lax beer laws (like North Carolina) and a better craft beer scene, breweries like Monday Night, Jekyll, and Red Hare won't last. We need less Red Hare's and more BHB's. Georgia needs more breweries pushing the craft beer boundaries. Anyone can make a lager or a pale ale, it takes a trained palate and skills to do what breweries like BHB, Wrecking Bar, and CC are doing. While Red Hare serves its purpose, I don't see them hanging in there when Georgia gets on the same level as North Carolina. Unpopular opinion of the day...."
atlbeer,3cqe13,bonerkebab,7,Fri Jul 10 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds you're looking at beer drinkers in general as though they are all beer geeks, and that's not the case.  We're a small subset of beer drinkers.  It was just last year that craft beer broke double-digits with  market share, 11% IIRC.  That means 89% of beer drinkers aren't looking for beers that push the envelope, actually a smaller percentage than that as within that 11% not even all of them/us are looking for those beers.  If I go out with a group of my non-beer geek friends and we have beers they are much more likely to order something from Red Hare than they are BHB/CC/Orpheus/etc.  There are also still a lot of people out there that will grab a 12-pack of beers like Long Day Lager to take to a BBQ or keep in the fridge and have a couple after work or after mowing the yard."
atlbeer,3cqe13,HunaTopper,2,Fri Jul 10 02:52:58 2015 UTC,"That's all fine and dandy but my point remains. They make boring styles and generic beer that isn't any better than a bud light. They have a place in craft, sure. But I think we are selling ourselves short by justifying it with the ""making craft beer for non craft beer drinkers""...that's a cop out. Asheville doesn't have breweries that make generic beer. I hate to see Atlanta settle for such bland boring breweries. Sorry about it Red Hare, Jekyll, Monday Night, and Terrapin...truth hurts. Think about it, beer to begin with is an acquired taste. When you're 16 and crack open a Pabst Blue Ribbon you want to puke it's so gross. But eventually it grows on you. Your palate evolves. How about challenging your novice craft beer drinkin' friends to try some crazy styles and branch out from the ""norm""!? It's like being that 16 year old kid again experimenting with whatever crazy stuff you can find in dad's liquor cabinet. I've turned my miller high life drinkin friends onto Orpheus and they loved it, screw settling for mediocre beer. Atlanta deserves better. That's my long winded opinion on Red Hare."

A lager, a pale, an IPA, a brown. Everyone does that. But they also have one offs and weird shit that they brew but don't put in cans. For instance, they've got their Soured Sticky Stout in barrels right now to be put in bombers in the next month or so, they've got the Imperial Red IPA which is a doozy, the Jose Cuervo aged IPA out now. They're expanding their business! Keep in mind they've only been there for less than 5 years. They established a brand and are trying new and adventurous things, and people are acting like they need to have the maturity of a brewery that has existed for more than a decade."

atlbeer,3cqe13,bonerkebab,2,Fri Jul 10 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"Wow, this thread blew up. I just read through it, and the general consensus is that they make basic, uninspired, and average at best beer. Now, that's not to take away from someone else liking it. You should never go off of what someone else rates a beer, because everyone's palate is different (not to mention hype trains coming into play).   As I saw someone else state that very few people mentioned sticky stout and some other beer- and that's kind of the point. I've had sticky stout- it's not bad. Not typically the type of stout I usually go for, but I've ordered it more than once, which at least says something. But this basically reinforces what a lot of people are saying, which is their beers are very forgettable- unless they are memorable in the sense that you remember how bad it was."

I don't think that you actually believe that, given your username and general attitude towards everyone else in the thread that disagrees with you. And that's ok too.

Also please quit comparing Red Hare to Monday Night because they're in the same distribution house. Monday Night makes a much better/consistent product and their limited releases range from good to great where Red Hare ranges from trash to that wasn't crap.  From a branding perspective Monday Night is also far superior, their company feels like a concept, Jonathan Baker has done a great job building a great culture and brand.

Draft beer also tastes different than bottled beer. Mind illusion or not, Hoplanta in a can tastes terrible but that's my opinion. Your mileage may vary."
atlbeer,3cqe13,underscorex,3,Fri Jul 10 03:15:57 2015 UTC,Why are you drinking Hoplanta? Did you lose a bet?
atlbeer,3cqe13,LoveChildNumberNine,0,Fri Jul 10 03:43:22 2015 UTC,I always try different beers each time I drink. I was on a local kick so I picked it up. It was terrible.
atlbeer,3cqe13,mondrarytomic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:37:00 2015 UTC,I can't say how hoplanta tastes from a can as I haven't had it.
atlbeer,3cqe13,bonerkebab,0,Fri Jul 10 19:22:46 2015 UTC,That's because you're actually tasting the can.
atlbeer,3cqe13,mondrarytomic,2,Fri Jul 10 04:12:49 2015 UTC,"Modern cans are far superior in every way. The air exchange rate it thousands of time less than a bottle, and with the polymer linings the liquid never comes in contact with the aluminum. It is also opaque which prevent UV degradation. If kept in relatively consistent cool temps a can should taste as fresh as the day it was packaged several years later."
atlbeer,3cqe13,bonerkebab,-3,Fri Jul 10 11:21:10 2015 UTC,I tasted Hoplanta from Red Brick in the can and all I tasted was metal. It was terrible.

atlbeer,3cqe13,jfulcher,5,Fri Jul 10 18:08:36 2015 UTC,Sweetwater is wayyyyy better than Red Hare
atlbeer,3cqe13,j00dypoo,4,Fri Jul 10 12:29:45 2015 UTC,"I've never been a fan. Obviously they are targeting the demographic of ""I don't like craft beer, but I want to drink local craft beer."" I have a problem calling long day lager a craft beer, because what is craft about it? It's a generic, macro beer on a micro scale. Which is great for them, and I'd love to collect a paycheck for brewing beer. However, as this craft beer trend keeps going forward, I can't imagine someone like red hare sticking around when the bubble bursts."
atlbeer,3cqe13,ATLBeerTrade,3,Fri Jul 10 13:15:29 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree - there's always going to be a call for lawnmower beer.  I'd rather pay a little extra for a local lawnmower beer than drink something from a macro.
atlbeer,3cqe13,DoctorPnut,2,Fri Jul 10 04:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, but can a brewery survive on that alone? We've seen the trend of the session IPA in the last year. With over 4,000 breweries in the U.S. now and more being added at a historic rate, it's naive to think that they will all survive. I can't see someone like Red Hare surviving in the end, because a bigger brewery will make that same session lager (a few already have) that will catch on. Now, that's not to say that they can't change their ways. Red Brick has done a fantastic job at that, IMO. Red Brick was always unimpressive to me, but then the 20th anniversary beer came out and totally floored me. Now they have a pretty solid lineup running and I stashed some bottles of their imperial stout in my cellar.   Also, it's hard for anyone to convince me red hare doesn't care about appealing to craft beer drinkers when they just released a tequila IPA..."

BAR | Beers Above Replacement.  A replacement level beer is the worst rated beer in the top 70% by volume for that particular style.  Basically the worst rated beer of the style that is available to most people. BAR25 | Sum of scores for a brewery's beers above replacement for top 25% of their beers.

atlbeer,3cp7q7,r_slash,3,Thu Jul 9 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I'm pretty sure they're not saying BHB is the best brewery out there. It's an analysis of top-heavy-ness. The first list (without BHB) is the most top-heavy breweries - the breweries that have some great beers but also a lot of unremarkable ones.  The second list, with BHB at the top, is for the least top-heavy breweries. Basically they're saying BHB is very consistent - all of their beers find themselves in the ""solid"" or better category. That's a big compliment for sure, and it's never a bad thing to find yourself on a list with Tree House, Cantillon, and HF. But it's not the #1 brewery by their BAR or Average BAR scores."

atlbeer,3cphnk,mef08d,5,Thu Jul 9 18:58:36 2015 UTC,I'm surprised to not hear about this kind of thing happening more often. There's no other place in Atlanta with four breweries in a mile and a half (30-minute walk).
atlbeer,3cphnk,LoveChildNumberNine,3,Thu Jul 9 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"If you are planning on stopping by Three Taverns, make sure you buy tickets before hand for the 2nd Anniversary party. Nothing worse than showing up 20 people deep and not being able to get in because its sold out."

Luckily my wife was fine picking us up and driving us to Twains. My advice would be to look up the hours and plan the trip. It seems that most breweries have expanded their hours recently, so you should be good."
atlbeer,3cphnk,DoctorPnut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:07:38 2015 UTC,I would say pre-purchase for 3 Taverns with it being their 2 year anniversary.

atlbeer,3cphnk,aubrewer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:59:54 2015 UTC,The sequence works 3 Taverns--Wild Heaven--Blue Tarp.  I've done two of three on a Saturday myself. And I've seen wandering gangs of folks making the tour over the last few Saturdays.   Look on w.atlantabeer.com for the calendar and timing that day.
atlbeer,3cphnk,HopPirate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:12:19 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea, and definitely doable. Bit of a walk from Wild Heaven all the way to downtown Decatur, but easily workable if you guys don't mind that.   One thing you might keep in mind is you can now bring home beer from breweries (not Twain's, though, as it's a brewpub). That'll be tough to do if you're walking, though. So, if you think that's something any of you guys may want to do, it might be worth having at least one car with a couple of coolers in it, to act as a beer carrier. It'll be a hell of a lot easier than trying to carry it all.  Have fun, man. Cheers."
atlbeer,3cphnk,shiftysquid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:18:07 2015 UTC,"I've done this as a beer5k since I'm about a mile away from WH and 3T, then I usually end up at Twains or Brickstore. It's not impossible to walk between the breweries, but it isn't easy considering their tours have such similar hours. You have to be pretty motivated to hit all three. For Saturdays, start at 3T at 1, then make your way to BT and WH since WH closes the latest."

atlbeer,3cmn8v,itsme_timd,4,Thu Jul 9 02:31:36 2015 UTC,In addition to Tims list I would add  Sante Adairius (if you can make it out there) Firestone Walker Heretic Bear Republic Speakeasy Drakes Fiftyfifty
atlbeer,3cmn8v,bonerkebab,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:36 2015 UTC,Also if you go to Russian River and/Bear Republic you might as well stop by Lagunitas on your way. It's a free tour and samples.

My personal list in the greater SF area is:   Sante Adarius Russian River Almanac - no facility open to visitors, but the bottles are all over the place Rare Barrel Lagunitas - Sometimes they have special stuff at the brewery that doesnt get doesn't get distributed. Cellarmaker   While you're out at Russian River, I recommend stopping to buy bottles at Beer Craft in Rohnert Park.  They also sell bottle shippers for reasonable prices, and will include extra packaging materiels to be sure your stuff makes it home.  They'll even ship for you if you live in a state they can legally ship to... so not GA.  And if you happen to get out to Sacramento, go to Corti Brothers.  Its an italian grocery store with a killer sandwich counter, and great bottle selection.  Chat up the staff and find out what they've got behind the counter.  Typically some good stuff."
