Yamaha R-S500 receiver, Schiit Modi DAC, Technics SL-D2 turntable, Raspberry Pi 2, and Amiga towers.  As this is DIY, I'll keep it to the parts that are DIY.  The component stand is a semi-retired TV stand that I made several years ago. It's a minimal design, but it works great for what all I have here. I sometimes wish for better cable management, but not enough to do something about it.  The speakers are the Amiga towers designed by Paul Carmody, finished in a satin white. I wasn't really sure what I was expecting when I started that project, but these have blown my mind over and over since I've gotten them done. The sound is full and rich, but still very flat. For $300 all-in I really don't think they can be beat by anything off the shelf. The finish work isn't my best, but it was rushed a bit and still looks good from a few feet away."

I love these speakers, in all seriousness I suggest them to anyone interested. The sound is very flat from 34hz on up, so they're very full and rich for their size. I listen to everything from Led Zeppelin to Bassnectar and Dre right now, and they always handle it in stride. I sometimes would like just a bit more on the low end, but I think that's just my adjusting from overly bassy systems of my past."

diyaudio,3e1c1n,GeckoDeLimon,4,Tue Jul 21 05:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'd trust neither of them. We can't tell what they're using for a lot of the supporting parameters, such as box losses, changes to Qts due to excess series resistance, etc. If each tool is assuming a different set of known parameters...that'll do it. Also, you have to be very careful specifying the cone diameter, as the physical measurement and the ""effective radiating area"" are two different things. These calculators rely upon the effective radiating area, and asking for the diameter means that somewhere along the line there's an estimation or two going on.    What are you looking to do? I have that driver in my Unibox database and would be glad to whip up whatever you like. However, the BR-1 box volume is just about optimal. It's slightly undersized and tuned slightly high, but these are good decisions that raise the overall system power handling."

diyaudio,3e1c1n,dcoolidge,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"Your enclosure should be 14L (.5 cubic feet), with a port that's 1.5"" x 6.5"".   The woofer requires an extremely low box tuning of around 40hz, so the port diameter is kept small to limit the required length. You may get some port chuffing noises if you really crank it up, but the original BR-1 did that as well, and there's really no way around it. A larger diameter port with equivalent tuning would need to be so long that actually fitting it in the box would be impractical. I would highly recommend using a flared port. You could take two of these, cut 1.25"" off (you need the extra .25"" length to account for the flares), and glue them together, butt to butt.   Also, there's a fair amount of flexibility to the tuning with that Dayton classic. You could make it as short as 5.75"" in total length without really throwing off the alignment more than 1dB. I wouldn't go any shorter than that, though."

It's running on OSMC and is paired with a Schiit Modi DAC for a better audio signal.  The RPi gets you 4 USB connections, ethernet, wifi if you want it, analog audio if you need it, and an HDMI connection for a monitor/TV. You really can't beat it for the price.  I'll forewarn you though, getting the Schiit Modi to work with it was a headache, but it can be done pretty easily with some code additions.  For an amplifier, I would base that on what type of speakers you want to drive. I've got a Lepai and it works well with smaller speakers, but lacks the power to drive anything I really like to listen to."

diyaudio,3dx4lf,iBuildSpeakers,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"Starting a speaker design with the cabinets is backwards and that's what is causing you trouble right now.  I'll second the suggestion for an active crossover, look into the miniDSP. This will make your crossover design really easy. It has built-in EQ which will (with enough power) fix your low-end issues.  Plus you can repurpose it for your next project."

Two sawhorses, a rotary saw, a jig, and some clamps shouldn't set me back too much.  I've been eyeing a miniDSP or similar for a while for a three-way system, but I've also been trying to get EqualizerAPO to perform the same tasks, as it seems pretty robust. I haven't quite figured out how to route different audio to different outputs, but it seems possible, so I'll get around to that at some point. What advantages would a discrete DSP offer me that a software solution wouldn't, aside from the obvious lack of a need of a PC?"

It's self contained, small, easy to use, has its own inputs and outputs, no worries about drivers and considering the cost of the PC and any additional hardware you might have to buy (extra sound cards) it's probably cheaper.

I'm pretty sure that was a sealed cabinet - so you need to make sure there are no air leaks in order to get decent bass out it.  Some of the guys on Audiokarma use rope caulk to seal the woofer to the cabinet to prevent air leaks."

diyaudio,3dtg2h,kokyunage,3,Sun Jul 19 08:18:01 2015 UTC,"Most tweeters are sealed back so they have no effect on the enclosure. If you manage to find one that is open backed you wouldn't want it sharing the same enclosure as a woofer since the large amounts of air moved by a woofer can easily overpower a tweeter and destroy it, you would want to give it a small space walled off from the woofers enclosure. Another thing is high frequencies aren't really effected much by enclosure size so it's not really important."

diyaudio,3dneaa,totallyshould,5,Fri Jul 17 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"I have built the lx-mini and the orions.  I'd say the lx-mini would be lacking in that sized room. I have mine in my bedroom and it's fine there, but I'm not listening especially loud and the room is quite a bit smaller. The bass is plenty adequate into the mid 40s.  For your larger room, I'd recommend either the LX521 or the new lx-mini studio which is the lx-mini with the bass unit from the LX521. The LX521 will probably have a bigger sound, but it's also more difficult to build and will need a decent amount of space behind it and to the sides to sound its best. If your room will accommodate that, go for it.  The lx-mini studio is going to be a lot easier in terms of placement, it can go much closer to the wall. With the help from the added bass unit, it should be able to fill a large room just fine.  I just love Linkwitz's designs, they sound fantastic. The aesthetics are lacking if you build them as specified, but check out the gallery on the web site for lots of ideas for how to make them look nicer."

I am into this studio idea, but also a bit curious about how the 4"" driver compares to a design with tweeters. i was worried about IM distortion at first, but really the 4"" should be able to go crazy loud with that 700hz crossover."

diyaudio,3dg6k6,kokyunage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'll +1 the Amiga suggestion if you're interested in doing some floorstanding speakers.  I bounced between them, the Overnight Sensations and the Tritrix for a long while before I made up my mind. The Amiga's are a better speaker than either of the others, but also more costly to build. I found the additional expense to be worth every damn penny.  My biggest tipping point that finally made the decision was that they run cleanly down to 34hz (and punch pretty hard down there if you want them to) which meant I didn't need to set aside money for a subwoofer. This means they were cheaper in the end than most every thing else I looked into.  The tritrix IIRC really only gets to 40-50hz on the low end, meaning you would probably need at least some sort of a subwoofer to really fill out the low end if you like to listen to dubstep, edm, rap, etc.  The overnight sensation is a great speaker for a 5.1 system or a near-field listening setup, but they just don't have the punch that a larger tower would have.  My only real drawback to the Amiga's is that they aren't very sensitive so you really need some power to hit their potential. I'm running 75w/ch into them and I get my receiver to +5db on occassion."

Youre going to need to pull it to make space and to see if utilizing the power switch will work for you.  Without getting too complex, a quick easy option would be to use a bookshelf amp that has a usb port and 3.5mm aux. Its pretty easy to connect a bluetooth carkit dongle to that.  You might also need a ground loop isolator since there tends to be some feedback powering the bluetooth through the amp.   The bluetooth will automatically start up whenever the amp is powered on. If you can splice the power cord across the switch on the radio it could work."

The answer is yes, but the chances of someone with no knowledge or experience turning a random hardware-store wheel into a bicycle that someone would actually want to ride are effectively zero.  To learn about tubes and get started building your own stereo amp, your best bet is to build a known good design, where all the tricky bits have been worked out for you. There are lots of kits and/or worked-out designs available. Here are a few:  http://spudkit.com/ http://cuamps.com/harmless.html http://tubelab.com/designs/tubelab-sse/   Does anyone with more tube knowledge than I know if I can do a stereo amp with this one tube, and if not, what can I do with this tube?   That tube can be used for pretty much anything you'd use a couple of triodes for. It would be a pain in the ass to design around, since it uses 23 volt heaters. You'd also have a very hard time finding any subjective opinions about it, since it's an oddball tube nobody uses."

Those and maybe /r/electronics would be your best bet for the rotary phone -- you want someone local who can do the soldering etc. I suggest you advertise the rotary phone task as ""use arduino to convert rotary phone into HID keyboard"". They can take the instructables link I posted and use the Arduino Keyboard API to send 1-9, 0, *, #, etc over USB. The arduino is powered by the same USB connection.  Now you have a rotary phone that acts as a keyboard, and will plug into any computer via USB. It can also have the numbers remapped via USB if you want it to send different keystrokes or keystroke combos in the future.  This really frees you up to use any software capable of recording and playing back audio, when the numbers 0-9 are pressed. It also means whoever develops it doesn't need to be local. This is where a freelance programming site would work well. Hire someone to write some record/playback scripts in a dynamic language (python/ruby/shell/javascript…) that will record the audio to a local directory. Setup a raspberry pi with the software and plug in your rotary phone keyboard. The pragmatic first step implementation of an ""approval queue"" is sharing the raspberry pi's storage drive using wifi and samba or a similar suitable protocol. The result is you will connect to the pi in your own computer as a remote harddrive in finder or file explorer, and be able to listen to listen to, copy, delete, or rename any file recorded by the system."

Below this frequency, the response falls off and goes to nearly (but never actually) zero because of phase cancellation.   In your case, you have no baffle, so the ""width"" is the driver dimension. Assuming you have 4-5 inch woofers, that means you're getting nearly zero response below 500 Hz for any realistic listening distance.

On Meniscus Audio, they also have a Blues MTM speaker, although this may be hitting above the budget I'd like (30% extra for the exchange rate, extra $100 bucks or so for shipping) really limits things..."

GR did the design for this company and bought out the rest of their stock and is selling it for great prices.    If you want something smaller, I really like the Sopranos.  They're a huge step up from the muddy sound of the OSs, and are in a very nice, compact size.  I'm actually running some Sopranos in my bedroom http://imgur.com/a/9FhaL along with a small sub that I built around an Exodus Anarchy woofer http://imgur.com/a/TXkHj.  This setup can get plenty loud and is used for movies/TV mostly.  I simply downmix the surround to stereo and boost the center channel in the mix by ~ 3-6db.  I never miss a whisper with this.  Never felt the need for a center channel although a 3rd Soprano would do just fine.  Try something like this out, maybe you'll be able to focus your budget on better stereo speakers rather than spreading them across multiple surround speakers.  As far as the Swopes - never really felt the need to try them.  The OSs I've built (several at forced requests) have never really impressed me, so I feel I just don't like Paul's voicing on his lower end stuff.  The Speedsters however, are a different story.

diyaudio,3d6hf5,Elaborate_vm_hoax,2,Tue Jul 14 11:16:53 2015 UTC,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a scientist, so my measurement capabilities are limited to basic RTA with a calibrated mic.    I know that Danny's reputation is a bit polarizing over the years.  Thankfully, I missed some of the heated debates that took place in various forums and came across GR Research on my own accord and have been able to build and evaluate his designs without knowing anything about him until I had built a couple sets. To my eyes, he doesn't try and over-represent or promise anything on his website and is pretty straightforward in my personal interactions with him.  I don't necessarily agree with everything he preaches, Electra tube connectors, No-rez, solid wire, but it could just be because my ears aren't that good.  However, overall, everyone who has listened to any of the GR speakers I've built remarks on how clear they are.  I've built many sets from the X-Series and a couple of his planar designs.  I feel that his voicing keeps an amazing amount of coherency to the midrange when compared to other offerings in the price range.  I know that he takes spectral decay very seriously, not just flat frequency response - I'm not an engineer, I don't pretend to understand it fully, but I have built many of the ""under $500"" DIY designs, and GR's are always very very solid when compared.  The only time I recommend anything else is if someone is looking for something in a smaller footprint for the price.    TLDR - Sorry, I don't have any more accurate frequency response measurements than what Danny has provided in the past - I could swear that I've seen more accurate than 1/3rd octave though.

Orders over $100 ship for free on Parts Express so it looks like buying them new may actually be a dollar or two cheaper. I know you said they're in mint condition but you didn't say they have never been used so it just doesn't seem like a good deal.

It isn't much, but cheaper than buying from them. They won't refund my purchase because it's been too long...I wanted the aluminum version, they sent paper. They have been used once, for 5 minutes... If you or someone else is really interested, ask me for $5-10 less, that's usually how internet bartering works.

The size of it: It's harder to be accurate with larger cuts Veneer work on curved surfaces   I would consider this a challenging build for me, and I have built a lot of speaker cabinets.  My advice: If you want to take this on as a first project, I would advise lots of practice cuts.  Every time you need to use a different technique, do a little experiment on some scrap wood. Once you feel confident that you can perform it accurately then you do the real work piece. Take your time and think things through."

The crossover takes a single, full-range signal (all frequencies) from the amplifier and splits it into two or more band-limited (small range of frequencies) signals for each of the individual drivers within your loudspeaker enclosure.  The picture you're looking at is almost certainly a mono speaker, so it would use one 50w side of your amp, not both 50w sides.

The cue lever can be fixed with an epoxy, provided the mechanism for pushing the arm up is not missing. If it is, it is not something you need to be concerned with. It will still work, just won't have the 'semi-automatic' feature. Returning them is not a good idea. You can just sell them for the same amount or more, after eBay fees, online, especially the Yamaha. I would say more for that definitely. The MCS problem is most definitely a dirty potentiometer gig. 40 is a bit much for something from a thrift store for this type of thing, yes. However, it is a pretty simple fix and you can either keep it and replace the Marantz, or sell it and use the funds to upgrade to an even nicer unit. MCS were usually made by NEC and Technics. They are good units and cheap too because, well, they were a JCPenny brand and there were price considerations in their manufacturing process. Knobs seem to be a little cheaper, a la Panasonic/Technics stuff of that period. The Marantz you have is actually a Phillips receiver after it had been sold by Superscope to Phillips. It is a good receiver, but I think the MCS would actually be an upgrade in this case, in looks alone, if not sound."

The output from the potentiometer will be the Lin/Rin.  You can find raw drivers on sites like parts express or madisound. Assuming your budget is pretty low here are some recommendations. hivi, fountek, faitalPRO. The hivi have a pretty broad bandwidth (more low end) while the faitalpro's will get louder on the same power. The fountek's are in between the two and would be my choice. I think this option will work better in a small enclosure.  The music and volume dial will determine how much power you use. 15w is a sinewave at max output.

diyaudio,3cskqz,mispeltname,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:56:37 2015 UTC,"The B3N really doesn't need a tweeter at all, I played the box for a few days prior to my soldering of the crossovers. However, my design looks cooler with them ;)  After first hooking up the left crossover, it really brings out subtle details like breaths and such on my benchmark songs when compared the single-driver setup. I have decided it was worth the ~$20 on crossover parts and the tweeters. I'll post my crossover schematic I drew later tonight."
diyaudio,3cskqz,MYNAMEISNOTSTEVE,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"Although you seem to think that the impedance rise will be an issue it really isn't, unless you have a low end woofer that will be placed in the same box I would suggest letting the speaker play down closer to 80-100hz since it should be able to get clean response that low."
diyaudio,3cskqz,CentralOhio,2,Fri Jul 10 21:39:49 2015 UTC,Without knowing what the tweeter response is like its a bit tough but for a first project that crossover point should be okay. Remove the high pass filter on the woofer though as it won't do what you're after. Use a parallel notch filter instead if you're worried about the impedance point. I'd also recommend buying some 1 and 2 ohm resistors and put different combinations in series with the tweeter to use as a attenuator as the calcs are never that accurate and is sometimes better to listen to your ears to work out how much to use. The crossover won't be perfect but its a good start to crossover design.
diyaudio,3cp64y,tenaciouscian,2,Thu Jul 9 17:31:03 2015 UTC,Not that mini amp as it is meant for 8ohm and up. Go for a tda2021 or something that is spec'd to drive 4 ohm speakers
diyaudio,3cp64y,ztoundas,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:48 2015 UTC,I'm not to familiar with car speaker harnesses but a quick google search will tell you how to remove the 4 pin harness and strip it down to the wires. Then figure out which wire is which and plug it into the speaker outputs of the amp. Power the amp and supply an input ( a stripped headphone jack cord should work) and you'll be good to go.
diyaudio,3cp64y,ztoundas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"I did a similar build here.  It's pretty easy, you just need a battery, an amp that's stable at 4 ohms and some type of enclosure."
diyaudio,3cojzb,Piklikl,24,Thu Jul 9 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Ideally, given the sheer number of speakers you're going to deploy and the distance you are travelling, you really should consider a 70V speaker/amplifier system.  This is commonly used in facilities like airports, malls, etc for large distributed paging systems - it has the capacity to run many many speakers in parallel or series and since each has its own transformer/autoformer, impedance matching isn't an issue.  With the 6 ohm speakers you are now considering, and the distance you want them to go, you'll be hard pressed to find a single (or even multiple) amplifier that could drive the entire chain at once."
diyaudio,3cojzb,hailhalehail,2,Thu Jul 9 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"The 70V system is what most are telling me, do you have any suggestion on how to go about finding one? Because of the size of this, would you recommend simply having an audio contractor of some kind do it for us?"
diyaudio,3cojzb,hailhalehail,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"I would.  Installing this many speakers to cover such a large area is a job for professionals; you'll also benefit from having a system that's not an assemblage of random bits bought off the internet, but rather a system designed and specified to do exactly what you need it to do and built using professional grade products as opposed to semi-pro or consumer electronics.    While I don't know the context of your project nor its location, there may be safety issues such as pulling cables through plenums where a professional could spec the correct wiring as to not violate fire safety codes.  Either way, running several thousand feet of wiring is a tough job, compounded by the problem(s) of how to physically get from point A to B to C, etc.  Standing on a ladder all day hammer drilling through masonry walls, pulling through conduits, snaking long distances - all stuff that unless you're experienced, would best be left to someone who has the tools and the knowledge.

diyaudio,3ci6od,tucsonmike,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:56:05 2015 UTC,"The lights dim because the hafler draws a lot of current. Replacing capacitors will not change that. I believe you already figured out the problem when mentioning the old wiring. It actually doesn't make sense that you would replace the bigger  electrolytic capacitors(there are two) in the system when small ones will go out of spec sooner due to age. Check the idle current and dc offset, if those are good then leave it be until your ready to devote some time to it. Edit: here are some random pics from my rebuild. The biggest bang for the buck I found was using a shielded wire for the signal wire. The transformer buzz is now gone."

diyaudio,3ci6od,tucsonmike,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:00:57 2015 UTC,"The initial power surge is from charging up the capacitors.  The caps are huge on this amp and someone may have changed to even bigger ones.  If you think somone has been in there upgrading, that's the first thing on the list.  Modern caps have much higher capacitance for the same size as old ones.  Check the values that are installed and make sure they aren't bigger (or more caps) than the orignals.  You can probably find a manual online somewhere to tell you the correct size.  In fact it's the first thing that comes up in Google.  That being said, unless it causes the lights to really dim, it's probably not a problem.  It only takes a second for the capacitors to charge up and after that the current draw is much less.  Make sure there's a proper circuit breaker in the place.   This is a big class-A amplifier and will throw off a lot of heat just in normal use.  Unless you can't live without the sound it makes, you might want to sell it to someone who lives in Alaska and buy something class-AB to save on your electric and air conditioning bill there in Austin. I like the big old Kenwoods from the 70s.   Prop whatever your turntable is on against the wall.  You can put something under the front two legs and then put something at the top in back against the wall to make it level.  Make sure everything is secure.  I have a similar old house and this worked for me."
diyaudio,3ci6od,analoghole,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:19:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'll take a look at the capacitors vs stock and see if I can't replace some of them.   I probably don't need the thing, but I am running a pair or Magnepans so in this case, most receivers won't cut it."

The NTC is a pretty easy fix as it limits inrush current at the primary (and consequently, to the secondaries) so your filter caps fill up a bit more slowly. Once at operating temp, the NTC should have a low enough resistance to be negligible."

diyaudio,3bu89r,lutkeveld,2,Fri Jul 3 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"That's not the problem here. The problem is the powerhungry amplifier. If you want long battery life (20+ hours), you have to switch  to barebone class-D boards. Those only use 0.4A on full blast, while having the same output as a headunit"
diyaudio,3bu89r,lutkeveld,3,Fri Jul 3 07:37:25 2015 UTC,with insensitive speakers needing 100W to get the same level as 10W (in the example below) it doesn't matter if you are comparing 90% efficient amplifiers vs 50% (worst case) efficient head units. Certainly you can do both but ignoring speaker sensitivity is foolish.
diyaudio,3bu89r,RZALECTA,2,Fri Jul 3 19:55:32 2015 UTC,"Why would 50% be worst case? Those class AB headunits are way worse than that. It depends a bit on the setup, but in my experience it's often the inefficient amplifier that is the main factor for low battery life. If you're comparing certain (car) speakers of the same size, parameters won't differ much. They are all designed around; Q~0.8, Fs~60hz, Vas~15L. There is a bit of variation, but way below 10dB"
diyaudio,3bu89r,classicsat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to stick with the head unit for a couple reasons, 4 channels (I've got 4 speakers now and I don't want to split the power between 2 speakers) a higher RMS (22 watts truly with 1% thd), and multiple audio inputs (it has a usb port as well to charge my phone), and the am/fm radio. The benefits outweigh the battery draw in my opinion) I'm mounting the whole system on an 80 quart wheeled cooler, and likely going to buy a marine deep cycle battery (or two) to power it all, and should still have about 40 or so usable quarts as an actual cooler.

diyaudio,3bu89r,michelework,3,Fri Jul 3 11:31:37 2015 UTC,"The headunit won't do 22W on 1% THD, it's more around 12W. Any headunit that claims to do 22W RMS on 12V in 4 ohm is lying. The powerclaims are often made at 14.4V in 2 ohm. Not that it matters much, because the audible difference between 22W and 12W isn't that big.  I can definitely see why you would want to stick with your headunit. though.

Any speaker driver, like a tweeter, is only as good as the design behind it, the crossover, cabinet (not really as much of an issue here, but the front baffle can play with the tweeter's response in unwanted ways), the quality of the components used, etc.   The size of the tweeter also doesn't necessarily mean better either. So, yes, the 3"" paper cone tweeter on these speakers, which is likely wired to a single cap as the ""crossover"", is bad (sorry!). There is a lot to consider when replacing a driver, and maybe you'll hear an improvement if you do, but you'll probably just waste time and money.   Enjoy them for what they are, or sell them and buy something else. That's my advice, for whatever it's worth. Good luck!"

diyaudio,3bm66p,totallyshould,2,Tue Jun 30 13:32:21 2015 UTC,Better would be if you can get a sub amp that takes both the left and right as an input and mixes it to mono before doing its own low-pass. The bass from all the speakers should add up a little nicer that way.
diyaudio,3bm66p,meezun,2,Tue Jun 30 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"That's a ludicrous amount of bass for someone who doesn't know what they are doing. Be careful you don't hurt yourself, or damage any structures.  Anyway, you are absolutely going to need a crossover and a dedicated amplifier for your subwoofer. You want the bass signals to go to the sub and you want to mix the left and right channels together. You want the high signals to go to the mains. You also want to balance the relative volume of the mains and the sub. That's what a crossover does.  You want an active electronic crossover. It goes between the input and the amplifiers. Here is an example.   You need a dedicated amplifier for the sub, because it needs its own amplification channel.  You also need some form of volume control before the crossover, but since you say you are using a mixer to driver this, you probably have that covered."
diyaudio,3bldl8,BurningCircus,6,Tue Jun 30 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"You want 20Hz if you can. You very rarely hear it because it's expensive, but it's delicious.   I have no experience with the LT as linkwitz meant it to be used, but there's one thing you didn't mention; it is meant to be applied to subs that are in enclosures that are too small. You get the system resonance Fb up above the driver's free-air Fs and then push tons of power in. It's for super tiny subs.   Normal application of whatever eq gets the job done is totally valid in sub-bass; necessary for best results. Do it. To reduce distortion, reduce excursion; get more drivers. Cheaper if you must, then add eq+power, you'll need less. There is no replacement for displacement. Sorry this has been a ramble."
diyaudio,3bldl8,derwhalfisch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:34:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! That's very helpful. The box as designed has a Q of .707 already, but the corner frequency is about 35Hz, while the driver's Fs is 22Hz. I'm not sure if this qualifies it as a ""super small sub"" (it's ~1.8ft3 ), but I doubt it. If I'm not shooting to change the Q of the system, but only the extension, can I still use a LT?  I definitely have plenty of power to sink into it, but I don't have the space/time/money to put together a second one of these at the moment, especially since this one can shake stuff in my living room from across the house."
diyaudio,3bldl8,GeckoDeLimon,3,Tue Jun 30 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"I suspect that boosting frequencies below the natural rolloff of the sub is a recipe for excessive harmonic distortion. Am I crazy for thinking that this idea sounds like it works better in theory than reality?   You can always apply EQ. Super-small boxes are used to reduce the chances of cone motion ""getting away from you"". But when it comes down to it, SPL is a function of cone motion, and if your target SPL @ 20hz requires 30mm of one-way excursion, the box size will not matter one lick. It'll take the same amount of cone motion for a .75ft box as it will for an infinite baffle.  Go find a copy of WinISD Pro Alpha. The later builds of WinISD are buggy (sometimes the application refuses to exit, errors when it tries to divide by zero, etc), but it DOES do modeling of LT circuits, with accurate simulation of excursion. I think it even has the Lab12 in its database.   Personally, I'd rather have the LAB12 in a horn. THAT is how you get bass you feel."
diyaudio,3bldl8,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:43:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I have WinISD 0.44 (which helped me design this box), but it doesn't do LT simulation. I'll download Pro Alpha and give it a go.   Personally, I'd rather have the LAB12 in a horn.   Me too. I seriously considered a BFM horn sub for this build, but I just don't have the space in my student house for the horn I would need to get the extension that I really want. I also don't need the 105dB efficiency. I'm running a single 100W channel to it right now at half volume (so I'm actually sending it 10W) and it's still overkill. I'm going for accuracy, not ""demolish my house."""

What I found to be more transformative to my system was doing measurements with RoomEQ wizard and then 3 or 4 parametric EQ filters. My sub went from boomy to ""lean and mean""."

For less shouting at the paint in the future, if you want a glossy finish I'd recommend a flat paint with a glossy clear coat over the top. Matte paint dries much quicker and is much less of a hassle in general, and clears aren't too bad to work with. Also, if you didn't use it, a good primer helps a ton.

diyaudio,3bc5om,special_20,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"You can also put small pieces of metal inside an air core inductor to increase inductance, and with some, unwind a bit of weird to reduce it. How close your inductor has to be too the design... that's another matter. Depending on the circuit I've seen the designer recommend anything within 25% to only a 5% variance. Oh, also the ratio of turns to henries is very close to linear: for example, if you have a 22 mH coil with 44 turns of wire but only need 20 mH, just remove 4 wraps of wire."
diyaudio,3bc5om,rickspiff,0,Sun Jun 28 09:38:42 2015 UTC,"An inductor is a frequency-dependent resistance. Its impedance rises with frequency. It works even better if you connect it to a capacitor in order to get an LC-filter. The impedance of a capacitor gets lower with frequency, so putting it together with an inductor, you get a filter, either high pass or low pass, depending on your configuration.   The ESR of an inductor is the resistance of the wire that the inductor is made up from. Its small, but its there. I wouldn't worry much about it, but im sure some hifi-freaks would. Just hit something thats roughly the same. Regarding the core: It has a big influence on the inductance, because a core concentrates the magnetic field created by the inductor turns, meaning that you would need a smaller number of turns to get the same inductance.  But the core is frequency dependent and dependent on the magnetic field that it has to concentrate. Since the magnetic field of an inductor is directly related to the current through it, the core material chosen will put a limit to the current that can flow in the inductor. Too much current will cause saturation, meaning that the core doesn't work anymore and the inductor looks like a short. Depending on the type of core, it could be any current that sets the limit. The core is also frequency dependent. At frequencies set by the core material, the inductance of the inductor starts to drop.   An air-core, however, doesn't saturate because there is no core material to saturate and it is frequency independent as well. So it works very well if you need stable impedance over a large range. The downside is that you'd need more turns because you don't have a core to concentrate the magnetic field, and thus you will either end up with a big core or a smaller core with a smaller wire diameter. The smaller wire diameter leads to larger ESR, which again puts a limit on the current through the resistor, due to resistive heating.   The question of what tolerance you can handle is entirely up to you. Most cores already comes with a plus/minus 20% tolerance.   If I were you, I'd start to work through distributors, because there must be similar devices out the. Another solution is to wind them yourself. Get an LCR meter(cheap on ebay) and a roll of cu wire and start winding. Its a lot of work but may be the only way if you can't find any other solution."

I just meant that if your intent is to increase the effective volume of the enclosure, you usually do that by stuffing the whole enclosure. You usually line the enclosure with absorbent material when your main goal is to reduce internal reflection.  If your goal is to increase the effective enclosure volume only slightly, but you aren't concerned with internal reflection, you can do that more easily and cheaply by using a lower density of stuffing. It's easier to tune that way as well."
diyaudio,3b4462,meezun,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"Stuffing slows the speed of sound within the box, which has a similar effect to increasing the volume of the enclosure.

A significant increase in the effective volume of a sealed-box loudspeaker can be achieved by a filling of fibrous material, typically fiberglass, bonded acetate fiber (BAF) or long-fiber wool. The effective volume increase can be as much as 40% and is due primarily to a reduction in the speed of sound, and not to the popular misconception of a change in operating conditions from adiabatic to isothermal."

Connect the DC adapter to one side of the switch, connect the battery to the other side, and the amp to the middle.  If you use a DPDT switch, you'll have 3 unused terminals, which is fine."
diyaudio,3b3r5q,photonoobie,2,Thu Jun 25 19:45:11 2015 UTC,If you use a switching dc jack with the pin negative and the shell positive you can switch the battery simply by hooking it to the switch terminal on the dc jack then just use an on off switch.  That way the battery will automatically be overridden by plugging in your dc adapter

diyaudio,3b2n8z,TheSmex,4,Thu Jun 25 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"Buy any 5.1 receiver with HDMI inputs and you should be set. Some are better than others, but all will do the job in this case.  The five speakers should work. I'm not sure what connectors your subwoofer uses, and/or if it connects in a standard way that will allow it to work with any receiver. Post a photo of the connectors on your subwoofers so we can be sure if that works.  For future reference /r/hometheater or /r/budgetaudiophile might be places to ask something like this."
diyaudio,3b2n8z,leica_boss,2,Thu Jun 25 17:30:20 2015 UTC,You're great thanks.  The Subwoofer has the same connectors and wire as the speakers.  Thanks for the recommendation for the subs. In the future I plan to turn a spare room into a wee cinema and /r/hometheater is just what I'll need.
diyaudio,3b2n8z,leica_boss,2,Thu Jun 25 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"If the sub only has high level (bare wire terminal) inputs, and does not have a power connection, then there is no amplifier inside. You need a subwoofer amplifier to use with it. For the price, you may have to buy a new subwoofer to use with a standard receiver that has pre-amp level (low level) output to a subwoofer."
diyaudio,3b2n8z,leica_boss,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"so when i'm looking for a subwoofer will it just say ""pre amp-amp level output"" ?"
diyaudio,3b2n8z,thyratron,2,Thu Jun 25 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"Nearly all receivers have a ""Pre out"" for the subwoofer. Sometimes labled just ""Sub out"", ""Subwoofer"", etc. This is an RCA jack.  Standard subwoofers will have a ""Low level inputs"", via one, two, or three RCA jacks. Any combination of a single LFE, Left/Right, or LFE/Left/Right. LFE stands for Low Frequency Emitter Effects (aka subwoofer) and essentially means just a mono signal.  They may also have high-level inputs, which means it can piggy back the full-range speaker outputs of a stereo receiver, extract the low frequencies, and use that for input. You would plug the subwoofer in between your stereo receiver/amplifier and your front main speakers. This method of connectivity is only used if you cannot use the previous method.  TL;DR: Look for a powered subwoofer (connects to AC power) that has a RCA input, usually black, or write/red.

diyaudio,3b2n8z,200pcd14,2,Thu Jun 25 20:00:05 2015 UTC,Any stand-alone subwoofer will be work. 99% of them have the connection you'd need from a A/V receiver.
diyaudio,3b2n8z,slccsoccer28,3,Thu Jun 25 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"3 Ohm doesn't necessitate that they are crappy, I have a pair I built that are ~3.5ohm and are very nice... but they're probably not that great assuming they came from a home theater in a box set-up.   Doing a quick search it looks like this receiver can handle lower impedance speakers but it'll probably be pushing it. Most budget friendly receivers can't run low impedance speakers well. Look around and make sure they at least have a rating for wattage with a 4 ohm load.  For something more budget friendly you could look at craigslist or similar and looking up the specs of the ones that pop up there. Yamaha is usually fairly good for low impedance speakers same with Onkyo.  At this price range though you might be better off finding a used one with working electronics.  Hope this helps!"

diyaudio,3axa09,jrshaul,2,Wed Jun 24 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"For all noise related issues with your power supplies, filtering caps will help a lot, a ferrite bead or two never killed anyone. In audio applications you generally want loooots of capacitance on the output of your PSU, due to the dynamic nature of sound reproduction. SMPS don't like looooots of capacitance on their outputs though, so you have to find some balance in there.   When you says there a lot of noise on the outputs, how do you know? Do you have a scope you're checking with, are you just hearing the noise through the speakers, or what? If you're hearing noise through the speakers when testing the amp boards, a lot of it could be that you haven't housed them in a metal case yet. Shielded cables can help a little, but unless you live next to a radio station, live in a super old house, or are wrapping your cables around that SMPS a few times, they shouldn't be required."
diyaudio,3axa09,Jcsul,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:01:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Is there a noob-friendly formula for calculating the filter caps? I noticed the power supply datasheet says the 150mVp-p max ripple and noise was ""measured at 20MHz of bandwidth by using a 12"" twisted pair-wire terminated with a 0.1uf and 47uf parallel capacitor. Would these work?  I have this same amp and power supply inside an active speaker. I get a decent amount of noise at higher volume. The speaker is all MDF, and the noise is audible (I have no idea how to use an oscilloscope). There is also a raspberry pi and dac inside it powered off a 5v step down. I get a lot of digital noise from that.  I'm planning on building the amp case out of wood - would you recommend laminating some light gauge aluminum to the inside?  Thanks a lot for the advice!"
diyaudio,3axa09,Jcsul,2,Wed Jun 24 14:49:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of switchmode supplies have them built in. Adding more ay not be advisable.  If you want to keep down electrical noise, you can use 3m 77 spray glue and put down a layer of tinfoil. Not pretty, but it blocks RF just fine."
diyaudio,3axa09,meezun,2,Wed Jun 24 17:38:21 2015 UTC,Sounds cheap and easy. This will be the first thing I try. Thanks!
diyaudio,3axa09,jrshaul,2,Wed Jun 24 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"Haha sorry, I don't know the formula for determining the size limit for capacitance on a SMPS. I'm not a pro, just a hobbiest trying to share what I can. You could probably go with a few hundred μf and get away with it just fine and probably be good to go. It's hard to tell over all since it was measured at 20Mhz and your using it for audio signals  It won't damage anything, it'll just present itself as noise.   Scopes aren't terribly hard to use, but they can be expensive and aren't necessary for building stuff for your own enjoyment. Lame sort of metal shielding would help in two different implementation methods. 1: covering the inside of the the wooden enclosure keeps outside noise...out. Noise from the mains, or radio, or in home wifi, etc. 2: You could more efficiently just mount the amp in some sort of metal case within the larger wooden case. This would keep all the previously mentioned noise sources, and also help block noise broadcast by the SMPS and the wifi."

More so than not they are ported. The ports need to be tuned to the box. The diameter, length and positioning of the port are factors. The box will require some sort of damping.

diyaudio,3aq2hq,athlaknaka,4,Mon Jun 22 16:11:37 2015 UTC,It's definitely possible to get a new connector on there. First things first though: do you have the part number for that connector?
diyaudio,3aq2hq,starburstases,3,Mon Jun 22 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"Beyond the part, you'll definitely need to get some ESD-safe tweezers and some fluxed solder wick. The job will also require a fine-point tip and 0.15"" diameter solder wire, so you may need to buy those, too, if that's not what you have already.  I'm not sure if this is what you meant by paste flux, but I've used a flux pen before with good results. It's very easy to lay down too much of the stuff that comes in the tub. The pen will put on a nice, thin layer.  Edited to add that it looks like one of the USB contact traces has come off. You'll need to get something to fix that, too. Since it's on the end, you may be able to hack a resistor lead or something onto the pin and solder it to the trace somewhere down the line.

diyaudio,3aq2hq,MrTallSteve,2,Mon Jun 22 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"yeah! I bought some solder wick and it was quite simple! this is the result , I finally discovered that the first two pins on the left were actually shorted together, I sucked all the excess solder with the wick anywaus, I used regular flux, put in place with the help of a small brush, fine solder thread and a soldering iron with a normal tip. The usb port is now in place and the controller even worked! But sadly just for a brief period, something like 2 minutes, even had the time to test it and all the controls were working, then it just went off, and everytime I plug it off and back in it stays on only for 3-4secs, but if I leave it disconnected for some minutes, then it stays on for a longer time....looks like some capacitor-related problem, or can it be something caused by a wrong soldering?

If it's a capacitor issue, you'll probably be able to see it as a damaged component.  Looking up what was on those pins might lead you to something else on the board.  Check the USB port on the source side, too, to make sure nothing's wrong over there.  Beyond that, I have no clue.  My circuit skills are limited to basic troubleshooting."

As far as technique for soldering a new usb on to those pads, I would lay some flux on them, and get some solder on the iron and ""pretin"" the pads so they have a little bit of solder on them, and do the same for the pads on the usb. Apply more flux to both, Get a pair of tweezers or needle nose pliers to hold the usb against the board (obviously line the pads up) and then heat the USB's metal case  as close to the pads as possible, the heat should melt molder on the pad and usb after a few seconds.

The motor is driven by a circuit called an H-bridge, from the logic signals the syscon provides.  Another way is to have an R2R or other DAC, and have it control a voltage controlled attenuator or amplifier. You can get package ICs, or DIY that.  Last is digitally controlled sound hub ICs. Those have direct digital attenuators, set by a serial line from the system controller. More modern ICs will have some EQ and source selection.

ELNA makes the list of high end Japanese caps as well BTW and are the God Kings when it comes to incredible sounding audio grade caps, that are also extremely affordable relative to anything else. No good reason not to use them, considering the unrivaled sound quality that they make possible.  Nichicon are middle of the road sonically and have a really strong 80's characteristic that I can't stomach and you find how limiting it is to the experience when you hear a good Elna setup in comparison. But Nichicon are much more detailed than Panasonic tend to be and they're both colored in their own way.  United Chemicon are quality as well and have some in the low ESR variety and high CV/miniaturized that are great in supplies like this application and also sound detailed while staying clean neutral.

The lower the capacitance, the smaller the cap (typically, always check dimensions in the cut sheet).  In LM78XX or LM317 circuits I've never had an issue with going with a larger capacitor (I'm not recommending it for your circuits now or in the future, just saying it hasn't been a problem for me), but I would definitely shy away from going with anything less than a 4700uF cap, unless you've done the math and proved that you can get away with something smaller."

diyaudio,3a8c8g,woodman1200,2,Thu Jun 18 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"Two things:   Often, capacitor manufacturers have a 'compact' line. Elna, United Chemi-Con, Nichicon, Cornell, etc. all have compact lines. Take a look at Digi-Key or Mouser - you can select your caps based on physical size alone. If the cap is too tall for your enclosure, you can lay it down on it's side. Lead length is not critical in this part of the supply, but try to keep them short -it's good practice.   As mentioned before, you can also use paralleled smaller capacitance caps of the same voltage - this will give you slightly lower ESR, and the caps will charge faster. Good luck."

diyaudio,3a49mo,JediNewb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yes both speakers get blocked, and the crossover frequency will change as well since the crossover frequency is a function of the speaker impedance.  Basically, if you had a 300 Hz bass blocker (per your link below) meant for a 4 ohm speaker then it will act like a 150 Hz bass blocker if hooked up to an 8 ohm load (two 4 ohm speakers in series).  Why do you need the 5.25 inch speakers?  Can't you just run the 6.5's ?  You could put a 300 Hz low-pass filter on the 6.5 inch speakers and a 300 Hz high-pass filter on the 5.25's.  That way the load impedance seen by the amplifier will be 4 ohms throughout the whole frequency range.  If the 5.25's are for the front, and the 6.5's are for the rear, then you should hook the 5.25's up to the 'front' outputs on the car's headunit, and the 6.5's to the 'rear' outputs.  That way you're not overloading the outputs."

I own and operate Microphone-Parts.com (having developed chronic GAS after working on RecordingHacks.com for years -- the only way I could afford to own all the mics I wanted was to build them myself!).   Regarding the circuit kits, I agree that neophytes should start with something easier and less expensive, like a direct box or stompbox or any of the beginner soldering projects available on Ebay.   Our documentation is pretty solid, though, so if you're able to reliably form a solder joint then the transformerless kits should be within your reach.   The transformer kits are harder because they tend to involve rewiring the mic. Soldering wires is, IMO, harder than soldering components, because the wire doesn't want to stay where you put it. It feels like you need 3 hands (in addition to a ""third hand"" tool).  The SDC kit is another exception, because the diodes and resistors all have to be installed vertically. That configuration adds a layer of complexity that elevates the kit beyond the reach of beginners (IMO).  All that said, we have had first-timers successfully complete our mic kits. I don't recommend it, but if you have the patience to read and follow the documentation, and you can reliably form a good solder joint, you'll probably be very happily surprised.  Regarding broken parts: we can send out replacement parts in many cases, for a flat $5 fee.

Also, I am of the opinion that surrounds should not be pointed directly at the listener, and THX specs agree. When you point the tweeters at the listening position, it assumes one single spot, and that goes against the ""every seat is a good seat"" mantra. You're better off shooting for uniform dispersion. Mount them perpendicular to the wall. Otherwise, you will have spots where the tweeters are noticeably brighter than other spots. This is especially true if you are arranging two rows of seating.   Much better that you're always ""a little off axis"" everywhere. The receiver's calibration mic will also give you better results overall."

I feel it is better to engineer around the amplitude problems and  then not need to correct for them. That means pick a c/o for the tweeter that is low enough  to avoid problems from the woofer or mid, and at the same time be high enough so the tweeter resonant peak is 2.5 octaves below that c/o, at second order (meaning -40DB at the tweeters resonant peak).

diyaudio,39ulve,lutkeveld,3,Mon Jun 15 10:19:37 2015 UTC,The whole point of modern simulators is that you don't have to purchase anything and still get a prediction of how your XO will work. It will save you time and money. Then you can measure your speaker to see if your speakers are functioning correctly.
diyaudio,39ulve,lutkeveld,0,Mon Jun 15 11:12:26 2015 UTC,In my experience the whole point of simulators is a waste of money. They don't do any of the things that matter most.  Read my sub.
diyaudio,39ulve,jrshaul,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:15:08 2015 UTC,And what matters the most iss.....? There are a lot of free simulation suites that can predict your response very precisely. Accurate input is the key to accurate output though.
diyaudio,39ulve,walkinthecow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"Imaging is far more important than a line on a piece of paper.  If you can't trust the graphs provided by the driver manufacturers then you need to use different drivers. If you don't know where to start when choosing drivers and crossover frequencies then read my ""getting started"" post.   This is the crossover calculator I use, http://www.apicsllc.com/apics/Misc/filter2.html.  It is accurate.  I don't need a simulator to tell me what I already know.   Can a simulator predict imaging?  Does a simulator account for the problems that capacitor brands and voltages produce?  Mixing the wrong brands is a disaster. Mixing voltages is a big mistake.  Frequency response is a choice of drivers more than anything else. Do your engineering right and the frequency response is a non issue.  Compensating for the flaws in the drivers construction materials is another matter, simulators don't know that subject exists."
diyaudio,39ulve,jrshaul,2,Mon Jun 15 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"'Imaging' is a pretty vague term, but can also be explained with engineering (psycho acoustics, room interaction).   The problem with textbook calcs is that you only calculate the electrical response, not the acoustic response. If you cross at, say, 4khz, but there's a bump in the response there, the effective XO point will be much further. You're also completely ignoring the varying impedance of a loudspeaker unit.  A simulator does not account for different capacitor brands and voltages because there is no audible difference. I believe that there are differences between elco's/film/tantals/ceramics etc. Just like mixing woofers and tweeters from different brands, mixing capacitors of different brands is not an issue.  Simulators indeed don't know that flaws in driver construction exist, they just take the input and calculate an output. If the input is the parameters you measured of that specific driver, the output is automatically compensated for the driver flaws.   I can definitely see that you're knowledgeable on this subject, but you have a completely different take on it than me."
diyaudio,39ulve,jrshaul,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:29:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, a completely different take, especially the fact that caps sound different. If you haven't learned that yet, then you have a lot to learn."

diyaudio,39tfri,OJNeg,4,Tue Jun 16 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"DACs are not a component where DiY adds a lot of value. Most of the implementation is internal to whatever chip you use. So it's a matter of picking a chip and hooking it up. Accomplishing that is highly technical and ideally involves custom PCBs and soldering surface mount components. That's not something you want to get into as a beginner.  You can buy a fully stuffed PCB and put it in a case with a power supply easily enough, and that's fine if that is the level of DiY that you are looking for. You won't learn much about the actual function of the circuit, though.  If you are interested in DiY audio in general, I find speakers to be the most rewarding thing to build. If you are sure you want to go into the electronics side of things, I would try my hand at amplifiers."
diyaudio,39tfri,meezun,2,Sun Jun 14 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.  Very informative.  For motivation reasons, the DIY project I was aiming for would be some sort of audio mixer that could be plugged to a computer.    From what I've gathered (see here), simple audio mixers don't pose much of a challenge, and the Texas Instruments audio codec with USB Interface are very affordable and are extensively supported by any operating system.    Loosely speaking, the main goal would be to provide a way to let the user plug a couple of musical instruments into phone sockets, let the user control the volume of the input signal, plug the signal into the USB port of a computer, and record at will.  Putting together something like this might be a daunting task for a newbie like me, but it also sounds like fund and appears to be a great learning experience.  I've noticed that there are some PCBs on eBay that appear to cover the interface bit, but that may eliminate half the fun.  Furthermore, if this project worked well, in subsequent projects I would like to explore the idea of adding functionality or even using different chips.  Do you believe this project would be feasible for a complete newbie?  And what possible courses of action do you suggest that a newbie should get in order to prepare for this sort of project?"
diyaudio,39tfri,meezun,2,Mon Jun 15 09:29:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is not a DAC, what you are describing is called a USB audio interface. Something like this.  But it sounds like what you really want is a learning project. To that end, I would suggest that you look into the Arduino platform. Arduino is a powerful microcontroller platform that will enable you to do all sorts of projects. More importantly, there are a ton of beginner-friendly resources available.  The project you are describing is not beginner friendly, and cheap commercial models exist that are superior to what you could build yourself, so I do not think that would be a very good project for you."

It comes with an onboard DAC unit, or you can use the I2S outs to add a higher-quality external chip.

It was tuned using bassbox and crossover pro software.  http://i.imgur.com/RrnSB8a.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/zViw8OV.jpg  Guess I ended up explaining more than I thought I had time for.

Once the engine is started the battery doesn't get used for running electronics (alternator takes over). For this use case he wants a lightweight battery that is good at constant long-term loads."

Get a 12V to 35V boost converter to power the amp. Plug-in the PSU to charge the battery when needed.  So basically, computer PSU - 12V battery - dc voltage boost converter - amp - speakers."

A lot have something like ""Max. input Wattage"" listed, but that is a super useless metric. A more useful one to lookout for is ""sensitivity"" as in decibels at 1W power and 1m distance.   None of the given amps provide a whole lot of power, so if you plan on playing loud you will need fairly sensitive speakers, so at least 90 db @ 1W/1m"

diyaudio,39a4qw,roadiegod,4,Wed Jun 10 11:54:35 2015 UTC,Depends on the she of the amplifier. New amps have very good protection against square-waving or DCing. But old ones do not and can cause issues with your speakers going to whats essentially a short circuit under DC voltage.
diyaudio,39a4qw,Monopun,2,Wed Jun 10 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"I think /u/lutkeveld meant that in these days people only focus on watts and believe that somehow a 50w amp wouldn't be able to power 1200w speakers. That's more myth than truth ;) If the speakers have a sensitivity of 85 dB, then yes, the output would be disappointing, but if their sensitivity was 99 dB, then 50w RMS would be sufficient in most cases"
diyaudio,39a4qw,lutkeveld,2,Wed Jun 10 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"A shortcircuit under DC voltage?   Square waving or DCing is only a fault state, those won't happen under 'normal use'. Key to staying within the limits is setting your gains right  Clipping in itself is not harmful, it's the properties of the clipped signal. Crest factor is reduced, so average dissipation in the speaker increases, which can result in thermal failure. If you clip a 200W amp on a. say, 1000W speaker, you can clip all day long but the speaker can handle the full thermal load, so it won't be damaged.  It's also a mix with what /u/monopun says. If you have an inefficient speaker you'll be pumping in more watts for the same output. Some people believe that a 100W amp on a 200W speaker 'won't work', which is simply wrong."

If you are going to Craigslist anyway, just pick up a cheap sub and be done with it.  If you want to build a good sub, wait until you have the money to do it right. Also, when you do build a sub, plan on actively crossing it to your mains for optimum results, don't just low-pass the sub using the built-in filter on the plate amp. You need to high-pass the mains as well."

And if it was, you would probably have problems with interference between the different speakers and where their sound fields overlap. Whether or not that matters in the real world is up for debate. If you want true 360° of sound, you'll need a Coherent Line Source (CLS) driver, like what Ohm Acoustics makes."

The woofers might be able to mask some of it.   Also the side by side woofer design causes a reduction in dispersion. And having the pair of tweeters improves nothing. Maybe putting the second set of tweeters on each side would improve the design."

diyaudio,392wt9,lutkeveld,-5,Tue Jun 9 10:04:39 2015 UTC,"Seems large for it's purpose, also not vented so a reduction in efficiency. I'd also like to hear the reason why two drivers (vs one on each side) increases efficiency? Each additional driver in a setup adds 3db, but that's also with double the power, even halving the resistance increases 3db, but also again at double the power. There is no free efficiency from adding drivers, just more power, if your amp is designed to handle it.   All the additional drivers did was add weight, box size, and lower dispersion.   Also again adding four tweeters doesn't make any practical sense. The two on each side face the same angle, don't add efficiency, or needed power handling.  I'm glad you are happy with the design, and it's cool to see people building custom things like this though, sorry to be a party pooper."
diyaudio,392wt9,Hardcorex,3,Tue Jun 9 08:52:06 2015 UTC,"It is vented, the handles double as a bassreflex port. There are several  advantages of a bipole setup: -No baffle step, so no need for a circuit to cut down 6db on midrange -Bucking magnet, reduction of stray magnet field -Strong, can't flex because the magnets are glued to the centre brace -Sound in all directions (increase in dispersion, not reduction) -Halving impedance so double the power, handy when you're tied to 12v."
diyaudio,392wt9,lutkeveld,-4,Tue Jun 9 09:13:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize the handles were kept as holes but they are not ports, they are holes in the box, which will ruin any desired sound properties unless calculated to the volume of the box.   I should of been more clear, I think their should be only two drivers, but still back to back like this design (Keeping Bipole design). Therefore bafflestep and gluing magnets still work. Bucking magnet can change driver specs so it is a complication to be designed for, which I doubt this was. Stray magnetic field should not be an actual problem in this design as far as I can see.   Dispersion is reduced when two drivers are side by side, such as this setup, or a 4x4 guitar cab.   Halving impedance does make amplifier selection somewhat easier but you can just use two, eight ohm drivers in parallel."
diyaudio,392wt9,Monopun,3,Tue Jun 9 09:48:02 2015 UTC,"They're calculated to the volume of the box, the dimensions are not picked at random.   A bucking magnet makes almost no difference in driver specs. I've seen the designer mention a 1db boost because of the focussed magnet field. It can be handy to reduce interference with cell phones. The main reason to go with bipole is (the lack of) baffle step and the sturdyness.   Almost all decent 12V amps are stereo, that's why the Boominator has two sides. You can build half of it, dubbed the 'halfinator', but it will obviously be 6dB less loud on the same amp."
diyaudio,392wt9,lutkeveld,2,Tue Jun 9 10:02:03 2015 UTC,"You should read a bit into what you are commenting on. The design is VERY specific, and absolutely no dimension or choice of woofer/tweeter, reflex size etc. are random. If you look through the Boominator thread on diyaudio (I know it's long) it's all explained.  But as /u/lutkeveld mentioned, the halfinator, which uses only 2 woofers, is also an option."

Not hard to understand why -- they are just another component in the crossover network...and are modeled as such during the crossover design phase.  Choosing a driver with a different coil impedance or inductance, for example, will naturally alter the performance of the crossover.  The question then becomes, are you likely to notice the change?  That all depends, of course, but I dare say no, particularly if you use a driver with similar specifications.  The closer the better, obviously.  I have not reviewed your driver choice but before you start replacing drivers in an established design you should understand each driver specification value and research how it influences crossover design and ultimately performance.  If you are unwilling to learn about these things, you have no business changing the design.  Sorry to be so blunt, but that's the truth."
diyaudio,38t856,moneyshift,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"Well said. One thing I would add is that I think this crossover would survive if you omitted the woofer section and used a minidsp as an active crossover and four channels of amplification to drive these. If you do that, you could (without much danger) tweak the woofer DSP crossover to get a fairly different woofer to sound good without influencing the rest of the circuit. I think I'm reading the schematic right, but I confess I'm not familiar enough with a three way crossover to understand if the three sections interact much.

The chip seems to distort at ~13Wpc (12v 4ohm). The MaxAmp is designed to get full output with 200mV (standard mobile output) input.

Each doubling of power gives an additional 3db from the rating at 1 watt, and you can read more about that here  The T-amps are quite efficient (compared to class AB) so the majority of the juice from the battery will end up doing useful work on the speakers. If you had some reasonably efficient outdoor speakers (say 96 db/watt) then you could be averaging around 115db at one meter distance.

So when you're playing at full power, let's say 15W, the amp will only (theoretically, not including losses) draw 1.5W. Several people have measured the power usage of their 12V class-D amplifier to be around 0.35A with two channels driving 4 ohm speakers playing music.  2000Dk can get you some quality equipment. No need to go with car speakers and a lepai amp or such :). Have a look at the Halfinator, that might be within your budget.   Don't purchase that amp. It will use more power than a normal 12V amp, but won't put out any more power.

Max efficiency in a portable formfactor while maintaining high sound quality was the main focus.   More bang/buck than a Boominator is next to impossible. If weight isn't a problem I'd go with a double 12v (so 24V) battery setup, driving a STA508 amplifier. Gives you ~60W total, is still very portable and doesn't cost much."

Those huge batteries aren't necessary unless you want to go days on days without an outlet. A double 12V 7.2Ah will cost you around $40. Get a STA508 from eBay with that for $15 and you have a setup that doesn't weigh much, doesn't cost much, is efficient, puts out significant power and lasts 50+ hours continuous on loud levels."

diyaudio,38slgh,jrshaul,2,Mon Jun 8 16:59:24 2015 UTC,Double 7Ah will give you about 15 hours on full volume (loud!). You could go with double 17Ah which will give you about 35 hours. Triple or quadruple those numbers to get your runtime on normal to pretty loud volume.
diyaudio,38slgh,lutkeveld,2,Mon Jun 8 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"The short answer is ""for anything this big, no."" They're designed to power an entire house.   I like the simplicity of wiring a car amp to a giant deep-cycle battery, but YMMV. Try Craigslist and see what you can get locally - if you can find a used class-D amp for $50 and get a big deep-cycle battery for $100 (not hard), you'd be pretty much set - and a lot of car amps are pretty efficient, too.   Alternately, if you'd like something designed for a fair amount of abuse, R/C airplane batteries are designed for stupid loads. They're also extremely lightweight. $40 at Hobbyking gets you two 2.45 Ah 5s (~22.5v) li-po packs - enough voltage to run a lot of the less expensive boards off one while the other's on a charger."

But these do not have a split. I'd tried to make a cable with a split for one of my cheaper headphones as an experiment a while ago.  My best success was braiding 6 strands of wire I stripped out of a Cat5 cable. I did two grounds, two left, and two right. At the Y, I split it off, and did a 3 strand braid to each ear. I did Heatshrink on both sides, and the main. Then, I cut a piece of heatshrink, put it over the split, and then put another piece over it on the main side. It reads as way more complicated than it was.  I also did some PTFE tubing, and cut a hole in the side so the two pairs could go in the side, and out the end. It was functional, but not as pretty as I had hoped.  I've made some pretty nice cable using the inner wires of some Mogami microphone wire. I've wrapped the wire in PTFE tubing, paracord, and techflex.  I remember seeing some places that had things for the y-split. One site I remember had some that were heat-shrink. I recall them being called ""cable pants."" I also recall seeing some custom splits using shell casings, and blocks of wood.

They need to be buffered, ideally right in the instrument with a battery like your usual accoustic guitar setup.  Otherwise the buffer needs to be placed as close to the instrument as possible.  You can't go right into a passive DI with a piezo output (though an active DI intended for guitar/bass should be ok). Any sort of guitar pedal that provides an onboard buffer, such as many guitar tuner pedals, could be inserted between the pickups and DI to provide the buffer function."

It will also be highly dependent on your choice of enclosure.  Full-range drivers are all about trade-offs. To get a wide response of frequency range out of a single driver you need to potentially put up with not-very-flat response curves, anemic bass, high frequency beaming, low maximum output, large unwieldy enclosure designs, etc.  Full range lovers are willing to put up with these compromises because they think that crossovers introduce worse compromises, mainly phase issues in the crossover region.  BTW, the drivers you linked have fairly low QTS which means that you aren't going to get any bass from an open baffle design. You might be able to get away with equalizing that somewhat, but you will run out of xmax pretty quickly. You will also need rather large baffles, and you probably will still want a subwoofer."

diyaudio,385lfh,jrshaul,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"An acoustically dead enclosure will not resonate at any audible frequency. The theory goes that there's actually three things you hear from a speaker - the direct output on-axis from the drivers, the summed off-axis response of the drivers, and the buzz of the cabinet itself vibrating.   Stereophile has a neat test for this - they actually place an accelerometer on the cabinet and measure its' vibration.   As for hardiboard, it's denser and stiffer than sheetrock - the fiberglass in the concrete makes it very strong. It's too brittle to make a cabinet out of, but if you use some sort of flexible epoxy (often sold for the purpose of dampening sound) to glue it to the inside of a cabinet, the end result will be extremely non-resonant.  A lot of the testing on this was done by a guy who went by WmAx. He died a few years ago, but you can google some of his loopy rebuilds of surprisingly humble speakers.   He also proved that old couches outperform ~99% of audiophile room treatments in objective testing. You need a lot of 'em, though."

diyaudio,383iph,sparkitect,3,Mon Jun 1 16:22:36 2015 UTC,Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) batteries work well with electronics and come in good sizes for what you are doing. I don't think it matters if you get the gel cells or AGM. Look for the ones used in UPS systems or for electric scooters (if you want a big one.)  I picked up a bunch of used ones for cheap. Commercial security companies will replace the battery backup in alarm systems on a regular basis even if the battery is fine.  Something like this.

diyaudio,383iph,Jcsul,2,Mon Jun 1 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"I think LiPo is what most people use for powering boomboxes. At max power pushing 40 total watts that would be 11.1v (closest LiPo voltage to 12v) @ ~3.6 Amps. Any LiPo battery should be able to handle that. I don't know the design of that amp at all, but looking at a shot of the insides on Amazon, I see 2 trimmers in there. Not sure if it has a boost/buck converter stage, but you may have to fiddle with those in order to it to sound just right running at 11.1v instead of the normal 12v.   As far as battery capacity (Mah) you run into issues trying to push 40 watts on the go. A 6000 Mah battery would only push this thing at max volume for about 2 hours. However, with it at 10 watts (which would still be over half as loud) it would last about 8 hours. All that assumes everything working at 100% efficiency, but you get the idea. A 6000 Mah LiPo battery at hobbying is around $50 though. Or you could get two cheaper 7.4v 6000Mah batteries, and run them in series for 14.8 volts, and possibly get a little more bang for your dollar. Or you could try getting 2 or 3 or 4 lower Mah batteries and run them in parallel, which would be more battery life and a cheaper over all cost, but it takes up more room.   I too, have been wanting to make a boom box, and have been looking into the battery issue ha."

I think the biggest disadvantage that the LiPo has is the cost. I think it will last longer, recharge/discharge wise compared to the SLA, but the SLA is almost a quarter of the price. The one I'm looking at can power a golf cart so, I think it can handle a 40 watt amp for some hours. I plan on making a post on the final project, so look for the results soon! Thanks again."

diyaudio,3812sh,tehsalt,2,Mon Jun 1 09:17:23 2015 UTC,I've done a little research myself a while back and recall finding this forum with different cable retailers.  After finding out the cost on these cables I figured it's worth recabling it if you own 300+ IEMs. If you have soldering equipment (which is not that hard) you could reuse the same cable by cutting the bad part and resolder the new end; that's unless the bad part is on the plug obviously.   The other alternative is to purchase other cheap IEMs and use the cable they come with them instead. I did that using these Monoprice 8320 on my Klipsch IEMs and they worked flawlessly.
diyaudio,3812sh,_somebody_else_,2,Mon Jun 1 10:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yes I have done a few pairs. Cheap ones and expensive all seem to use the same wiring inside... It's a PITA even with a few years soldering experience (I work at a bespoke audio cabling firm). The few custom repair jobs we've done were loss-makers in terms of the time spent fixing them...  The wiring inside IEMs and earbuds is horrible. Incredibly thin cores that are bulked out with synthetic fibres that will melt instantly, and the wires themselves are usually coated in a tough enamel type material that insulates them. Usually a green and a red set.  To get solder to take to the wires you have to lay the wires on a flat surface and scrape off the enamel with the edge of a craft knife, as if you are trying to remove paint (do this until the bare copper shows through). The exposed wires will barely take to any solder so you have to get the surface as shiny as possible.  It sounds like you're trying to re-solder inside the actual earpiece. Which makes things even harder, though not impossible. You really need a tiny solder tip so you can reach in without melting everything nearby. You'll have to be quick and accurate otherwise the mini-pcb with the solder pads will just melt and deform...  But since your IEMs aren't really expensive it's worth experimenting on them. You may find it easier to use donor wiring from another set of earphones - though expect the same quality of wiring regardless of brand.  Good luck!!  EDIT: PS, the earpiece shell will probably need gluing up again once you've cracked it open as they use a gum-type of adhesive that probably won't stick them together again. Ensure the phones are fixed, then use a dab of superglue to put it back together for good!"

diyaudio,37z34w,jonnyb95,5,Sun May 31 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"The danger relates to the current handling capacity of the output devices, and their power dissipation ratings. Using 2 Ohm speakers on something not rated for them, could cause the speakers to draw more current from the source than it can provide, causing damage.  In general, if you restrict the volume to low levels, you can safely operate it in this condition (although some amplifiers might have problems such as instability and oscillation with a low load.)  The Lepai uses a TA-2020 chip, which features built-in overcurrent and overtemperature protection, so you are unlikely to be able to cause catastrophic damage even driving it too high, but you might get output instability nonetheless.  The TA-2020 isn't a bad module for what it is, but it gets to be pretty distorted at high power levels - which in my experience were the levels you'd normally want to listen at. Of course, a boombox isn't generally something you sit and listen to but it's more portable.

Apart from that, I'd look at the following:   Check all solder joints & clean up flux with IPA. Inspect your (virtual) ground layout for ground loops. Look at beefing up your power supply, especially if you can do away with the voltage divider.

diyaudio,37tu8p,cosmicdog,3,Sat May 30 14:14:30 2015 UTC,"Scored a pair of Realistic NOVA-16s at an estate sale for $7 a couple weeks ago, that looked brand new, and picked up an STA-800 at a thrift store today for $20. When I tested it all out, the surrounds self-destructed after a few seconds. Sounded killer up until they let go. I have the basic idea of how to refoam a set of speakers, but since it's my first attempt I was wondering if anyone had any tips or tricks to pass along. Thanks in advance!"
diyaudio,37tu8p,HotCharlie,3,Sat May 30 09:57:25 2015 UTC,"My first attempt at refoaming was with a Realistic 40-4050 subwoofer, using Tacky Glue (much, much more forgiving than the adhesive that's included with a lot of kits) and pretty much just aping this guy.  And it worked great. Good luck!"
diyaudio,37tu8p,chazmotazz,3,Sat May 30 19:47:01 2015 UTC,"The video you linked to is a pretty good tutorial.    I use an acid brush to spread a thin layer of glue.  Otherwise I tend to lay down too much and get squeeze out, which looks bad.  Also, I after doing the initial alignment I clamp the surround down with clothespins, and check everything with a test tone.  The speaker should operate without any buzzing, scraping, etc. over its functional frequency range.  I'll typically run a sweep from the crossover point down to 30hz on a typical woofer.  Just hook the woofer up to one of the speaker outs on a receiver/amp, and use a test tone generator on your phone or computer.  This way you have a chance to correct any alignment issues before the glue drys."
diyaudio,37tu8p,brandvegn,2,Sat May 30 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"I just did 18 surrounds on some Bose 901 Series IV I got for free. I think this is a pretty easy project when time is of no concern. I would say I think going for the cone first and letting dry first for about an hour will get you there with less headache. Then pull up the edges of the new foam and get your frame prepped with a steady bead and hold the cone down a bit and make sure there is clearance where the coils meet the cone. Once you get this aligned, just monitor the tacky glue and make sure it is adhering to the frame. It should not be too much of an issue, but there may be some adjustment and so I would keep checking and make sure every 2 or 3 minutes until you can see it has clearly set and will not be moving too far off from where it is."

It won't boost bass, instead it'll widen the frequency range it can reproduce. Currently it rolls off earlier than what is preferable. You can also increase the value of the large electrolytic filter cap on the board, this will smooth your power supply help reduce bass distortion at higher levels."

diyaudio,37661y,DaveDischord,2,Mon May 25 05:16:56 2015 UTC,"Well, its an acoustic instrument preamp, so the plan is to have it setup for piezos and/or mic.  Basically, without a battery, I wanted to make the preamp able to run signal direct to the mixer and run off of phantom power provided by said mixer, but also, if a mic is used, it is also running of the same power.  The way I've understood it, I can use voltage regulators on either Ve+/GND or Ve-/GND to provide 9+V to the opAmps that each channel uses, however, on the mic input, I need to provide regulators adjusted to equal voltage on both Ve+ and Ve-, using a switch to go between adjustment resistors dependent on what the mic operates under.  As far as signal path, I don't know how to lay it out to where the mic signal travels through the opAmp before leaving to the mix.  Also, how to, if possible, to have 1 OpAmp output signal to, say pin 2, while the other 2 output signal to pin 3, that way I can provide an effect to the signal from one input, piezo or mic, while the others run clean."

If you're from EU they can be bought at accusafe.nl, not sure about the US though. Muse has made some great amps with the TA2020 chip, they're on eBay. Also the amplifier is designed to clip at 90-95%, so that's nothing unusual. Do as /u/meezun says and wire the speakers in series. Also remember to have a 10A fuse on.

diyaudio,36rp5l,Monopun,2,Fri May 22 07:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you say the Maxamp won't work? Unless the car speakers have a horribel sensitivity, 20 watts will be enough. If not, I'll recommend investing in some better drivers. The Sure linked to is also a viable choice but consumes almost 10 times the power of the Maxamp/TA2020-based amps. Also I would never recommend wirering lead acid batteries in series unless their Completely identical. This also means same amount of usage, recharges etc. It's alot easier to just invest in a 12-24V DC boost converter."

diyaudio,36rp5l,Crackertron,1 point,Fri May 22 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"No the both the Lepai (assuming it's lepai TA2020) and the maxamp20 outputs roughly the same. However the speakers you're using are really ineffecient, rated to 93  dB pr. watt @ 1 meter. This is really really bad. Buying drivers with a sensitivity of 96 dB would sound twice as high with the same power applied. However you would need 10 times as many watts to play the same level with the ones you have now. Therefore I recommend buying another pair of drivers"

Keep in mind, however, that fitting an adapter or alternate power supply inside is likely impossible, simply due to space constraints.  Edit: I found the service manual. Internally, there is a simple set of linear converters.

A use able tube power amp needs high voltage, so you're looking at a DC to DC converter to step up the voltage to 150-200V, where you can use any typical design. A pentode class AB would probably be the simplest.   I agree that it's a bad idea. Those tubes are going to break and are very inefficient. Why a tube amp for a car radio? Modern car audio gear is really, really good these days."

diyaudio,36hy3g,yoholmes,21,Tue May 19 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"It's not quite as easy as selecting a schematic and knowing whether it is quality or not. Parts quality, layout AND design are the factors that make an amplifier quality or not - does not matter if it is tube, solid state or digital. The other factors are experience, i.e.; knowing which circuits you like and don't like, and experimentation. That's where the fine details are; they cannot be adequately conveyed in a reddit comment :-)  If I may recount my amplifier story: I am/was a tech for 23yrs. I started my career at Adcom (when they were in NJ) because audio was the driving force that got me through trade school. I have owned dozens of power amplifiers over the years just to hear how they sounded and to see if I could make them perform better. Over the years, I found out which front end, VAS, and output stage circuit topologies I liked, and which modifications and specific components worked best on that particular circuit, etc.. After a while, I stopped drooling over other people's designs and started building my own based on the circuits I liked. My ""thing"" is making the power supply(s) as quiet and stiff as possible (my quietest preamp had a noise floor of 40uV). I also prefer simple topologies, but there are exceptions. I look for what I like and then integrate it into what I have learned. Don't expect to be original in your designs, as most audio designers use tried and true circuits that have been used for the last 50 yrs. My latest amplifier borrows a little from Adcom, Goldmund, PS Audio, Krell & Classe - nothing is original about it, I just put it all together MY way.   I highly recommend Audio Amplifier Design Handbook by Douglas Self - this is like a bible for amplifier design. I also recommend spending many hours/days/months on diyaudio.com as you will be able to ask actual designers (like Nelson Pass or John Curl) any design questions you have. Also, an audio analyzer, dummy loads, and an oscilloscope are a big help in developing your amplifier.  Good luck!"
diyaudio,36hy3g,woodman1200,4,Tue May 19 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"Comment hits the spot straight on. Your comment coneys what makes amp design (and even broader, electronics design) a true difficult craft to master. There are simply too much ways to do one thing, that -as you mentioned- there is no straight answer for what quality or basic is. Each design has it's own flaws and benefits. There are simply too much parameters and that's what makes it a true craft. It requires a certain feel and experience to know what does what and how it reacts to certain layouts.  For example Philips and Bang & Olufsen use the exact same components, but there's still a significant amount of difference in quality. Bang & Olufsen simply hold the components to a stricter requirement."

He specializes in high-quality Class-A mosfet designs, and provides great support to the DiY community.  With DiY amps, there are a number of ways to go. It all depends on your goals.   You can buy fully built and stuffed boards. Just add a power supply and a case and you are good to go. Not a lot of DiY satisfaction, or knowledge gained but it's easy and you can get good bang for the buck.  You can go the chip-amp route. With chip-amps you can buy a kit with a circuit board and parts and just solder it, or you could source the parts yourself and wire point to point.  Or you can build an amp from discrete parts. With this again you can get a kit with a ready-made PCB, or source parts yourself. Lots more knowledge gained here and you can explore more exotic topologies.  There is also the question of what kind of amp you want to build. Tubes? Class-A? Class-A/B? Class-D?"

diyaudio,36hy3g,jwmatx,3,Tue May 19 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"Class-A is lower in distortion than A/B, but it comes at a cost. Class-A amplifiers waste a lot of power and generate a lot of heat. You end up spending a lot on your power supply and heat sinks and you need a large chassis to hold it all. It's generally only practical for low power amplifiers.  Tubes are expensive, hot, inefficient and high in distortion. The distortion is primarily 2nd or 3rd order, though, which can be pleasant to listen to.  Class-D amps aren't all that practical for DiY. They use high frequencies, and you need to be really careful with path lengths and layouts. You are also generally using a chip which contains most of the implementation, anyway. Fully built class-D modules are my go-to for a quick and easy amplifier, though. Just stick them in a box with a switch mode power supply and you are good to go. They are cheap, efficient and can sound great, but you aren't really doing much of it yourself."

A good frequency to use would be anything below 20 Hz, as this is the limit of human hearing. A simple high pass rc filter is designed to allow 1/sqrt(pi), or about .7, of the input signal voltage at the designated frequency, so to have a frequency response which extends the full range of the lower end of the spectrum, you may want to use a lower frequency. You can use the Objective2's output stage's rc filter for a cutoff frequency of under 1Hz iirc. Not sure how well the cmoy will drive speakers though... Doubling the voltage to both rails would allow more headroom for signal gain, and shouldnt alter any ac characteristics of the circuit, just make sure that whatever op amp you use can handle the extra voltage."

Yah I am not sure how well it will drive speakers either but I am going to try and if not I will make another amp for this.

B&Q may have the same issues. If this is your first circular saw, know for this you need a guide to ensure all of your cuts are exactly aligned.  Run the saw along a clamped down straight edge that you are certain is in the exactly correct location.  A table saw will be faster and more accurate, but with some effort a circular saw can work. For the router, you will need to make a jig to ensure the holes are exact circles - not a big deal.  Or you can buy a prefabricated variant - though they're significantly more expensive. You could probably get by with 4 clamps if you have a fast enough drying wood glue, just use a right angle block to align things.  I use my kreg jig for this kind of stuff, but for speakers I'd exercise caution granted it may generate acoustical abnormalities.

Prepare to waste some wood. Luckily, MDF is cheap. Do some practice cuts to get used to the saw.  Also, if you have not done this before you should be aware of the dust generated by working with MDF. When you cut MDF, it disintegrates into a fine dust that hangs in the air and gets everywhere. Personally, I refuse to use it anymore for this reason. Do your work outside if possible and wear a dust filtration mask."

diyaudio,36db58,Firebreathingwhore,1 point,Mon May 18 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"You may want to include additional bracing at the corners, which in addition to making the box stronger also gives you more area to glue to, and generally helps keep things from sliding around during gluing.  Also, for gluing the large cabinet, that angle looks shallow enough that the clamps will hold fine. For the smaller upper cabinet, re-use the angled cut-offs during your glue-up so you have flat clamping surfaces (toss a sheet of waxed paper in there so your cutoffs don't accidentally get glued to your speaker)"

You will probably end up with something that costs more and performs less well than what you could get commercially.  Some specific issues...   You don't build a passive radiator by just using speakers and not driving them. The cone needs a specific mass which is calculated along with the parameters of the active drivers and the volume of the enclosure to get a specific response.  You don't get decent bass of out 3"" drivers, no matter what configuration you use.  If you just want to have fun experimenting, I would grab a copy of winISD and do some simulations to see what kind of frequency response you can get from the drivers you want to use with various enclosures. It will allow you to simulate passive drivers as well as ports."
diyaudio,36awm6,PatientWho,10,Sun May 17 21:51:54 2015 UTC,"Think about how much noise a saw makes through Styrofoam insulation. And then about how much noise it'd make cutting a couch cushion. That's a big part of why its not used.  We have to consider the purpose of the foam. If the foam isn't actually foam, but fluffy fiberglass or polyfil, then it's purpose is to slow down the speed of sound in the box, and it works specifically because fiber filaments are small and they easily absorb kinetic energy. Styrofoam is not dense enough or compliant enough to do that job.   Alternately, open cell foam is also applied to the walls of an enclosure as another way to try to absob excess midrange energy bouncing around and resonating inside the cabinet. It works similarly to fiberfill, but without much affecting bass frequencies and box losses the way the fiber does (you see this method employed more with ported speakers that don't want their box calculations altered). Still, the one thing it has in common is its open cell nature. Its breathable. Air can pass through it. Packing peanuts are not not really porous, so again they do a bad job of absorbing energy.    What else can be used? If you need to knock down the required box size, anything like fluffy fiberglass is your friend. High end dudes use lambs wool, since the fibers are not round, but flat. They feel it does a better job of knocking down frequencies,  and they're measurably correct. It can take 10-15% more cheap acrylic / polyester pillow batting (by mass) to do the same job. Sure, you can just add a little more poly, but in some cases that extra density can begin to choke the midrange"

With all this in mind, I'm thinking that I might have to settle for only using the system when able to attach to mains voltage... or if anyone can recommend the cheapest way to get 4 channels of 100w with decent frequency range at 12v that'd be amazing (all the car head units i look at are 25w rms / channel max)"
diyaudio,36807q,lutkeveld,2,Sun May 17 03:57:05 2015 UTC,This sounds all wrong for a mobile system. What you want for starters is efficient speaker drivers. This will give you more volume for the power. With the right drivers (>90dB / watt) you can get plenty of output for just a few watts of power.  Then you can get a low power amp that will work quite nicely with 12V and run for a long time off of a charge.

A pre-amplifier's job can include source-selecting and/or volume control.  A pre-amp can be as simple as a 10k potentiometer wired between the line-out of the source and the line-in on the amplifier (passive) or it can be a piece of hardware involving tubes and op-amp or other transistors/IC's (active).  An L-Pad attenuator is usually used to lower the volume of an individual driver in a 2-way or 3-way speaker, usually only by about 6-12dB, and not intended for use as a volume control.  You can get volume controls that work at the high-level between the amp and the speaker, but they are less ideal.

That said, I'd advise generally against glued butt joints.  I don't care how little stress the box will get, a glued butt joint is just a very weak joint -  especially if you're using actual wood as opposed to MDF (the end grain will soak up the glue leaving a poorly glued joint - some people use a technique called ""sizing"" to combat this, which is just pre-applying some thinned glue to the wood grain and letting it dry first).  Alternatively, reinforcing a butt joint or building a stronger joint is so damn easy it's hard to justify not doing it.  The comment here that the box will probably be plenty stable because it's small and it's glued on all 4 sides is completely correct, but if I were going to the trouble of building my own speaker box I'd want the added security of a little reinforcement.    For me, the easiest joint for a box is a locking rabbet.  A few passes on the router table and it's good to go.  Alternatively you could use anything from pocket holes to wood blocks to biscuits to simple screws.  Here is a good article outlining your reinforcement options."

It seems like you are coming from a different place than the DIY ethos.  Most of the projects here are (well) under $500, start with the design to solve the particular problem, and then spec out components to match the design, generally with value in mind.  Your approach seems more like you have fallen in love with a particular component, or a particular ultra-high-end design, and you're determined to plow ahead in trying to realize your vision without any real design work.  You generally can't take an existing high-end design and try to swap out components with different specs and hope to improve things.  So if you are determined to clone the Salks, then I would reuse their driver selection, crossovers, etc.  If you are determined to use a Raal ribbon, then you'll have continue the kit/design search, or look into doing the design yourself.

But for $5000, I could build a world-class set of speakers that you might have to pay $25,000 to beat. That's because the margins are a lot slimmer at the low end. High end speakers often cost 5x-10x the cost of the parts that went into them."

Why not just save your pennies a little longer and get what you really want?  $3000 is an awful lot to risk on your first build. Even if you manage to match the sound of the those speakers, you will never match the fit and finish (unless you are already a pro woodworker)."
diyaudio,35v7j0,prozackdk,2,Thu May 14 21:32:30 2015 UTC,"No one's really answered your actual question yet, although it's probably a moot point.  Properly designed speakers have custom crossovers for its particular drivers, driver mounting location, and baffle size. You change any of those and you've changed the frequency response. You might get lucky and the variation might be small, but still most likely not ideal.  Jim Salk designs great stuff, but they're effectively being sold as retail speakers. DIY is always going to give you more bang for the buck, but it requires skill, knowledge, and proper equipment to design a good crossover. And most folks who can design good high-end speakers don't necessarily want to give those services away for free.  I've lusted after RAAL but only because of what I've read. Since I've not heard one I went with the cheaper route and used a Fountek ribbon tweeter in my design.  $700+ each for a RAAL tweeter is a bit much for something I've never heard.  That being said, $3K will get you a very kick ass DIY speaker. The issue is finding someone to design it for you...."

diyaudio,35qsrd,silock,2,Tue May 12 19:16:01 2015 UTC,"I have yet to try any paid software for speaker design, so all my recommendations will be for free software, which may be good for someone just starting in diy speakers.   Jeff Bagby has some excellent free software available, they're all Excel spreadsheets on steroids. The standout piece here is Passive Crossover Designer, a really good crossover designer. Baffle Diffraction and Boundary Simulator and Woofer Box and Circuit Designer are not bad, but I prefer other software instead. WinPCD is a standalone piece of software based on Jeff's Passive Crossover Designer. It has basically all the same functionality, but I personally prefer it to Jeff's Excel sheet. Here's Charlie Laub's site that has some more free software/spreadsheets available, including the excellent Unibox. BoxSim is another box modeling software, one of the better ones. The website is in German, but the program is available in English. WinISD is a super basic box modeler. It's my least favorite box modeler, but I actually really like their ISD Online java applet as a quick and easy way to estimate enclosure requirements for a driver; it's excellent when browsing for drivers online. If you're interested in Horns, HornResp and Akabak are good for those.   EDIT: I realized after I posted that I listed a lot of stuff here, and honestly, function-wise, there's a lot of redundancy. I'd recommend starting with either:  Passive Crossover Designer / WinPCD (essentially the same thing) + Unibox  OR  BoxSim  I currently use WinPCD + UniBox, and quite like it, but am working towards using BoxSim. BoxSim has a steeper learning curve (and finding tutorials is harder since all the official documentation is in German) but is all-in-one and is quite powerful (and looks much slicker than most of the other free software)."

diyaudio,35qsrd,GeckoDeLimon,2,Wed May 13 11:07:25 2015 UTC,"After building them I would like to measure the output.   IMHO, that's the wrong time to do the measurements.   The goal behind crossover design is to shape the response of the drivers to work as a cohesive unit. Yes, manufacturers give specifications sheets, and depending upon the company, they're accurate. But they're accurate depictions of the driver's response on an IEC infinite baffle--NOT in a room, not installed into a box. There are some very good tools that will help you transform the manufacturer data into something you can work with in a simulator (I did a write-up on using those tools). But if you have the ability to measure, the time to do it is before crossover design. Build the boxes, test fit the drivers, and measure each one individually. So many of the various acoustic phenomena that we have to account for in simulation tools (like baffle diffraction effects and acoustic offsets) will all be inherently included in your data.   When it comes to the actual crossover, the simulation tools model real-world results astonishingly well. Mathematically, their job is extremely simple. I've measured, built the XO, and measured again, and the only deviations in response were due to subtle shifts in microphone and speaker placement. Unless something sounds extremely off (due to crap soldering or something), it's to the point where I don't even bother doing final measurements anymore.   As they say, ""garbage in, garbage out."" The better the data you feed into your crossover modeler, the better the results. And the best data to gather is in the final assembled box in your room."

Took me a bit more than 3 months to finish them.   The small fullrange driver (Vifa 8 NE 125/4) has a very clear sound well suited for vocals or acoustic music. Given the small cabinets I am pretty surprised what a full sound they produce if you crank the volume a bit. They have surprisingly good imaging and bass response is very good for their size.

I found this (Warning, German, but the pics say it all) and intended to build something similar. Sadly the mount for my router was a bit different and I had do it a bit different.  As you can see in this picture I made three slots in a piece of MDF. Two to mount my router on and in the middle for the router thingy. I had to get longer screws to mount the jig to the router. To the right of the middle slot you can see a single screw which I used to mount the faceplate of the speaker through a drilled hole in the center of the cutout. After that all you need to do is turn on the router and spin around the MDF. Only tricky moment is the very last bit of the cutout when your middle piece gets completely cut out.   I did a few test pieces to get the radius right. Not sure if was my lack of experience or the crudeness of my selfmade jig but after a few tries I got it right and did the real pieces."

diyaudio,35ksdz,lol_r_amiibo,2,Mon May 11 08:38:27 2015 UTC,"The most common setup for a volume attenuator is basically setting it up as 23 voltage dividers (well x2 really, since two channels). Unless you're using balanced audio, you don't actually have [+L, -L, +R, -R], you really have [+L, G, +R, G], perhaps that's where the confusion is setting in.  All the ground-side resistors are always tied to a common ground, so you're using one switch gang to control which + side resistor the input connects to, and the second switch gang to control which voltage divider you pull output from.  Can you take a picture of the switch, or link to where you bought it from. It shouldn't be hard to find a pinout diagram, although for switches it's sometimes implicit and you can always test with a multimeter."
diyaudio,35ksdz,howmanydads,1 point,Mon May 11 10:50:39 2015 UTC,Thanks.  The audio is indeed balanced. This is the switch in question.

diyaudio,35ksdz,howmanydads,1 point,Mon May 11 11:53:51 2015 UTC,"Using this finished switch as an example, are the rings the ends of the top and bottom-most resistors my ground in the case of balanced audio?   Yes, the rings of exposed solid wire at the top and bottom are the common grounds. If you want to build the switch with balanced in and out, you could wire it the way that switch is done, but you'd need 4 switch gangs per channel (as opposed to 2/channel for unbalanced), which seems somewhat wasteful. I'm gonna think about your situation a bit and see if there's a more sensible way to set up a balanced stepped attenuator.  EDIT: So the way that the finished switch you linked to is setup, and the way I was expecting you'd want yours set up is as a resistor ladder, where each switch position has 2 resistors of its own. There's no reason that the switch has to be set up like this though. It could be set up like a potentiometer, as you first described, but with resistors acting as the resistive substrate.  EDIT 2: This site is actually perfect: http://www.goldpt.com/attenuator_types.html It describes exactly what I was talking about with pictures rather than my convoluted descriptions. You could use a series or shunt type attenuator, one for each half of your balanced audio. That said, I still do question whether this switch needs to be balanced, but that would depend on the circuitry around it and is probably a question better answered by someone more knowledgeable than me.   And I'm guessing the voltage divider diagram only relates as far as an unbalanced signal?   Yes, the voltage divider diagram as shown only works for an unbalanced signal; if you feed a balanced signal in, it will be unbalanced out. You'd need two voltage dividers, one for each half of your balanced signal.  That said, that isn't necessarily an issue; if you're amplifying shortly after the voltage attenuator, it shouldn't matter whether or not it's balanced. Really, balanced audio makes sense on long line-level (or mic or phono level) interconnects, where electromagnetic interference can be problematic."

diyaudio,35eezk,harveywalbanger,2,Sat May 9 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"I personally use an Audiosource AMP 100; it's a true 50wpc into 8ohms, from 20hz-20khz (Ken Rockwell did extensive measurements on it). It also is an old school A/B design, and has a high dampening factor, around $120. Downsides are the size, and simplistic features of the amp, and the larger size. OS's are very inefficient (trade off for the bass extension when compared to the woffer/driver size, and cabinet size).  With a properly powered amp, I find the OS's can easily fill up a small/medium sized room. The Lepai amp, though cheap, honestly barley puts out 10wpc considering the power supply and distortion numbers. IMP, the OS is not a good pair with that amp. At least 30wpc really help them imo."
diyaudio,35eezk,ksneote,3,Sun May 10 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"I think that amp is a bit under powered. I use an old Yamaha AVR stereo to power my Overnight Sensations. The Sherwood RX-4109 is an amp that should do well for you, and its around $100. But since it is spring time, I would look at garage sales to see if you can find an old receiver and save some $.  The OS will not have massive bass but the bass is great for their size. Just remember, a 4 inch driver provides bass. For my use, as a set of bookshelf speakers in my bedroom, they are awesome. So build them, and if you still want bigger bass, your next project should be a powered subwoofer. The highs will be great with that tweeter.  The OS kits are a great way to get your feet wet with building. I would buy some clamps to hold things together while the glue dries. Or ask around if you don't want to buy, a family member may let you borrow a set for a couple days.  I would use Titebond wood glue for this project. Type of Titebond doesn't really matter for a project like this, original, II or III. Don't use a poly based glue for your first project - cleanup is a massive bitch. Regular wood glue cleans up with water. The wood will fail before the joints.  Good luck!"
diyaudio,35eezk,Luxin,3,Sat May 9 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"The Overnight Sensations are not sensitive at all, so you want an amp with a decent amount of power. I wouldn't use a Lepai at all. This SMSL amp for $105 should work nicely. The 160 wpc figure is a bit inflated (rated for 4 ohm speakers with a high THD) so 50 wpc undistorted for 8 ohm speakers is more realistic. If you want more advanced features or the ability to eventually move to surround sound, you may want to go for a full receiver instead. /r/zeos has receiver recommendations.  The OS's have a surprising amount of bass given their size, and can get decently loud, but you can quickly hit the upper limits. These aren't for raging house parties though. These start to noticeable roll off below 45 hz or so, so if you want lower bass you'll need to buy/build a sub as well."

diyaudio,353wyo,Fudge-alpaca,2,Thu May 7 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"I grabbed the 18U rack rails from partsexpress.com, picked up some 1.0625"" thick poplar planks that were 48"" x 5.5"" from a local lumber place. Ran the planks through a planer to get them 1"" thick, then used a biscuit joiner to cut slots for the biscuit joints. Applied glue, inserted biscuit joints, clamped things up. The resulting boards were 48"" x 16.5"", so they went through the table saw. Two boards were cut to 40"" x 16"" for the sides and the last board was cut into two 21"" x 16"" boards for the top and bottom. Drilled pilot holes into the top and bottom board sides, applied glue to the edges and screwed everything together. Two coats of urethane, and 3/4"" screws to hold the rack rails into place. Then I tried racking some gear and realized quickly that including the rails made for a very tight fit. Most gear fits very snugly, some gear doesn't quite fit. Next rack I built will give a bit of extra tolerance, so 19.2"" instead of going exactly 19""."

You'll also appreciate a flux pen and some cleaner. It's possible to get by without this stuff but man it makes my life easier.  A temperature controlled soldering iron is incredibly handy - mainly for its stability at a temperature - Farnell/Newark have a brand called Tenma. it's a cheap Chinese unit for sure however I have clocked up 1000+ hours on my Tenma 'Digital Soldering Station' without complaint.

I had some shielding issues but they are mostly fixed now; I have to set my pretty powerful amp up to max to hear any hum.   I have also struggled with inner track distortion but it was due to the azimuth being slightly off and me, in my inexperience, addressing it by applying anti skating. I've since been told that 12"" arms doesn't need anti skating and after fixing the azimuth it proved to be true.  I am currently running it without the anti skating weight.   It sounds great; I've exposed it to a few audiophiles and they have not complained about anything. One even told me there is no reason to believe that his Rega Planar 3 is any better.   The tone arm wire was quite a problem.  I've rewired since the photos have been taken.  The best wire, that's not too restraining, is from old headphones.

diyaudio,34y5ev,Asomewhatclevercomme,3,Tue May 5 15:12:14 2015 UTC,My only comment as to their sufficiency for a 5.1 is that they don't make a center channel. You generally want the center to match the left and right as closely as possible and I doubt you'll want another whole tower in the middle (though this would be ideal).
diyaudio,34y5ev,awgoody,1 point,Tue May 5 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! That was actually one of my biggest concerns, it seems that a lot of DIY kits are made to be solely used in 2.1 systems as opposed to surround sound systems."
diyaudio,34y5ev,meezun,1 point,Tue May 5 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"One thing you will discover in speaker building is that small, simple speakers can sound really, really good and larger systems with many drivers are exceedingly difficult to get right.

diyaudio,34y5ev,Armsc,1 point,Tue May 5 18:20:10 2015 UTC,I think I would start with something like the Overnight Sensations kit and see how it goes.

Plus their power requirement is perfect for most 5.1 receivers.  As for using the MTM as the center channel I've heard some gripe over using that horizontally; I've also seen some people redesign the cab to account for this.  I've been looking at doing a set with OS and emotiva before a full 5.1 set"
diyaudio,34sp3s,F_D_P,7,Mon May 4 05:59:35 2015 UTC,"I havent tested this is depth to give you scientific explanation, but main reason you want to couple speakers to enclosure is because speaker is a large moving mass which is capable of moving whole speaker assembly just by moving ""piston"" area a tiny bit. If allowed to move whole assembely freely, This creates a lot of distortion due to no linear cone movement relative to listener. Linearity will therefor depend on frequency and amplitude.  If you happen to listen to same speakers in same type of enclosures, but different materials, lets say wood and granite, boy they sound different. Ofcourse thats a lot due to cabinet resonances, but mass and speaker coupling to this mass plays a big role."
diyaudio,34sp3s,tiqa13,5,Mon May 4 11:01:37 2015 UTC,"if i understand what you're saying, then one way to think of it is that you don't want to decrease ""noise"" (music!) from a loudspeaker, like you do from a fan.  assuming that the amplifier is ok, the speaker is receiving a clean signal. you want all of that signal converted to sound.  so you want to mount the driver as rigidly as possible.  if you use a soft mount then you're going to start not reproducing certain frequencies, because instead of moving the cone, and so generating noise (ie music), the driver is shaking around."
diyaudio,34sp3s,andrewcooke,3,Mon May 4 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"Most speakers are designed with cabinets that compensate for lacking frequency response in the driver, for example most bookshelf speakers have a bass port which resonates at low frequencies helping the bass sound louder. Completely isolating the driver from the cabinet would mean you would get rid of some of the unwanted resonances in the cabinet however this might damage the sound as you'd rely more on the frequency response of the driver being what you want. I've seen some speakers where this is totally wanted, for example the tweeter is not even in a cabinet because it provides all he high end needed, however that requires careful driver selection and crossover design. I haven't seen any subwoofers without a cabinet, I think it's probably to help the drivers reach those elusive low frequencies.  If you're looking to apply this in some speakers I highly recommend the DIY Audio forum, I'm sure someone there will have more detail or may have attempted it themselves."
diyaudio,34sp3s,Swazbuckle,4,Mon May 4 09:12:40 2015 UTC,"That's like saying you want to decouple a guitar string from the guitar. It makes music because it's coupled. Think of the rim of the speaker enclosure like the body of the guitar, and the cone like the strings. It needs to be tightly attached somewhere so it has something to push-pull from. Otherwise it would be like holding a speaker in the air in your hands, without an enclosure. They don't sound correct that way. Much of the sound comes from the enclosure.  Also, think of it like a traditional drum, where there is material stretched over the a rim to create a tight surface that is bonded at the circumference, but can flex in the middle."
diyaudio,34sp3s,leica_boss,2,Mon May 4 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"The driver frame needs to be mounted rigidly for maximum transmission of acoustic energy. In the same way that putting shock absorbers on a bicycle saps some of the pedaling energy from the rider, putting vibration absorbing material between the driver and it's mount would sap some of the acoustic energy from the driver.  It is desirable to prevent vibration from being transmitted from the driver to the baffle though. The baffle can vibrate sympathetically with the driver which will color the sound. The is the reason why you want your baffle to be thick and made of sound deadening material.  One technique that I have seen is to brace the back of the driver against the back of the enclosure. This will transmit some vibration energy to the back of the enclosure, but since that's facing away from the listener, it's less of a concern.  In open baffle, it's not unusual for the driver to be mounted by the magnet on the back of the driver like this. This is more important on open baffle because the baffle is not braced by being attached at the sides."
diyaudio,34sp3s,meezun,2,Mon May 4 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it ""decoupling"" so much as resonance control so the cabinets don't color the music, and your higher end speakers do use some fairly exotic materials besides MDF to accomplish this."
diyaudio,34s733,faruqmarican,4,Mon May 4 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"why the ground loop iso?  i don't think you will need tweeters. the full ranger should be fine for highs. with it and the tweets you will never hear the ""sub"".  as for wiring, make sure you can bridge that amplifier safely. assuming 3 drivers you would wire the fullrangers in stereo then take positive from one and negative from the other for your sub. hopefully not nuking the amp. impedance can get a little weird with three drivers in this config. maybe 8 ohm fullrange and 4 ohm sub?"

diyaudio,34s733,AndrewLucksNeckBeard,3,Mon May 4 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"You should probably re-think your crossover network. You're making a 3-way speaker but only using a high pass filter. Also, you amplifier is rated for 4 ohm speakers. Are you going to be hooking up these speakers in parallel? Also, are you using the radiator to for the woofer enclosure or sub-woofer?"
diyaudio,34s733,lutkeveld,2,Mon May 4 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"I planned to put all these into a single enclosure. Also, I was on going to high pass filter the input into the tweeters, I did include a low pass filter, it should be the first item on the list.   Should I only be using 4 ohm components if i do plan to wire it in parallel?"
diyaudio,34s733,AndrewLucksNeckBeard,3,Mon May 4 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"It's definitely an expensive build. Here's my suggestion. Cut out the tweeters, woofers and passive radiator. Just buy two really nice full-range drivers. If you buy nice enough full range drivers you shouldn't even need a a crossover network. Ports should work just fine. They're also very cheap and easy to tune because you can cut them with a saw and not worry about ruining something expensive. Just buy an extra port and try out a few lengths. Also I would highly suggest separating the woofer enclosures from one another with at least one wooden barrier."
diyaudio,34s733,swrrga,1 point,Tue May 5 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"PR's are better than ports for small enclosures. Low tuning in a small enclosure requires a big/long port, which doesn't fit most of the time and eats up space.  For portable applications 4 ohm is better, you can get more watts at the same voltage."
diyaudio,34s733,swrrga,2,Tue May 5 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"Also, get a 8 ohm speakers and a Class D amplifier for 8 ohm speakers. Sure Electronics is a great, cheap amplifier company in China."
diyaudio,34s733,lutkeveld,3,Tue May 5 02:34:58 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's an expensive build.    Can you give us links to the actual items instead of just a screenshot? Kind of hard to tell what exactly you're working with. Why that amp? How do you plan on powering this thing? What's your plan for the enclosure?"
diyaudio,34s733,lutkeveld,3,Mon May 4 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"1 x low pass filter  1 x amp  2 x full range driver  1 x sub  2 x passive radiators  2) I honestly chose the amp from guess work, the one a step below it is 2x15w at 4 ohms  3) I plan on powering it with a 12v power supply, not a battery. So I will need to figure out an appropriate power supply.  4) The plan for the enclosure is to build one using wood. I understand that the dimensions of the enclosure can impact the bass sound so I will need some guidance on that.  Thank you very much for your time and Happy Cake Day!"
diyaudio,34s733,lutkeveld,1 point,Mon May 4 08:56:49 2015 UTC,"The size of your box is one of the primary things that determines the sound quality - generally bigger is better. Does it need to fit into a pocket? Does it need to fit into a backpack?  What I would do personally is search thrift stores for the biggest pair of old speakers I could find, bolt them together, and mount that bluetooth board and a cheap class AB amplifier inside.  Old speakers should have all the internal crossover etc stuff sorted out for you, are supposedly tuned and ported correctly for their drivers, and lots of vintage stuff is high sensitivity so you don't need much in the way of watts. Half a watt into a big pair of bookshelf speakers sounds WAY louder than half a watt into some tiny laptop speakers.  You can get some really high quality stuff for $20 if you know what to look for.  If you do really want to build your own speaker, I would recommend finding a reference design and building that, then adding your bluetooth and amp at the end. There was a ~ $60 3-inch full range build posted here recently that seemed pretty interesting."
diyaudio,34s733,meezun,1 point,Tue May 5 03:40:13 2015 UTC,AB is a waste of power. They consume 4 to 5 times as much as class D on full power.
diyaudio,34s733,mrdoom,3,Tue May 5 17:13:07 2015 UTC,Amp isn't suited for this purpose and tweeters aren't needed.  This is going to be a very expensive speaker that performs worse than commercial options if you're not going to take the time to simulate the enclosure and crossover networks.
diyaudio,34rp7p,CorporateHobo,3,Sun May 3 23:59:40 2015 UTC,"If you want it to be truly correct, use a third Cornscala."

diyaudio,34rp7p,Doc_Spratley,1 point,Mon May 4 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"Another Cornscala would be the best option. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Crites. He has done a lot for the Klipsch community. But, I don't see how there will be a good match between the center channel and the Cornscalas. He is using the same driver (the D220TI) for the tweaters. But, the CSC-1 depends a lot on the woofers for the midrange (2k and above). The Cornscalas are using horns from 400 Hz and up (I believe). So, you will definitely get a mismatch in the lower midrange between the two.   Of course, this is all if budget is not a concern. If budget is a concern, the CSC-1 probably does a lot for the price. But, it looks like your talking about $500 versus $700.   As far as putting the tweeter in the Mission bookshelf, there are crossover considerations there. The output may not be matched. You may have very loud output (most likely) or very quiet output from the tweeter if the crossover is not modified. You also have to consider if that tweeter can handle the same frequency response, etc."
diyaudio,34rp7p,dman87,1 point,Mon May 4 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed feedback. I am trying to reduce budget. Space is also a concern, there is no way a center Cornscala would pass WAF. Perhaps Bob might help me with a crossover for the existing speakers and a D220TI."
diyaudio,34owar,badmak,2,Sun May 3 04:41:12 2015 UTC,"I got this kit about three weeks ago and have had to slowly whittle away at it. I'm go to share my thoughts on how I approached it, so hopefully it helps someone who is also a dumb ass.     First thing I did was go to the home Depot and buy a four dollar rubber mallet and glue, I should have bought the #6 square drive screws at the same time. The ones they sent would strip out before they would sink into the wood, l also used a bit a little bigger than they recommend for pre drilling. So I assembled all, but the final side and was able to hammer it on, clamp it and screw it down with only two Harbor Freight clamps, no problem, just clamp, screw, clamp, screw.  I do recommend dry fitting everything a couple of times, before gluing it. Then I sanded and used wood filler on the edge, probably did this about three times before primer. The primer was shalack based spray. If I did it again I would have done a better job with the primer. It was kind of expensive, ten bucks a can. I should have used three cans and my sander was a little too aggressive. After three cans of spray paint I had enough and called it good, a little splotchy though.     For the crossovers, I used Curt Campbell's design instead of the PE one, so I could zip tie and glue them to the braces instead of using a piece of wood and then mounting that.    Lastly, If you go through some build post, there are a lot of tears about the tamper proof allens not being included, well, I just use a flat blade control screwdriver I had laying around the house and tightened them as tight as I was willing to, with no stripping.    After getting them all finished I was disappointed with the paint job. It's not so bad that my wife or sisters would start pointing out mistakes, but I know they're there. Once I got them set up though, I was not disappointed at all, my lighting isn't showing the mistakes and they sound nice, but I haven't really got to listen that much yet. Tomorrow I will."

diyaudio,34owar,leica_boss,2,Mon May 4 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"I use them for HT and they are fantastic. I went without a sub for 6 months and it was fine. I later built a sub to assist them, but alone they probably can hit lower and harder than whatever sub came with your friend's soundbar. I also like that there is both a ported and sealed MTM bookshelf option to use for a center channel. Also, you can build MT versions for surround speakers, which is my next project."

diyaudio,34m5wb,lutkeveld,1 point,Sat May 2 15:30:25 2015 UTC,Im thinking of going with the lower Qts that way i can just make it ported and have a smaller box. 0.5 sealed is gonna need a lot of space.   edit: the first one is cheaper by 20 bucks

Rubber surrounds, and no paper cones (as they'll not like big changes in humidity). Stick to metal or mylar tweeters for the same environmental reasons.  Alternately, you may want to get a pair of marine-rated coaxials and just plop them in boxes, since they'll basically do the things I've mentioned. Also, they have a passable crossover already in place.  Plywood, since it's dimensionally stable. Stay away from solid wood because it'll be prone to cracking & splitting. Stay away from MDF, because it REALLY swells with wetting, and never really gets its old shape back."

Output Voltages from consumer devices can go up to about 4 V p-p but usually lower than 2 V p-p. Even at 10 V p-p most opamps available will be fine with this - you will have no issues here.  Output Voltage is a bit more difficult to give an answer to as the dynamic nature of headphones and the large range of impedances. A better criteria to hit is a supply Voltage. If your supply is +/- 4 V you should be able to drive most headphones just fine assuming your opamp isn't a very low curent output chip. If you are able to get +/- 9 V + you will have little issue driving most stuff."
diyaudio,34i4m7,TomAskew,2,Fri May 1 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"So you've connected the -ve supply of your op amps to ground and your +ve to 15V, using precisely half the 15V supply as the analogue ground reference?

diyaudio,34i4m7,Einmensch,2,Fri May 1 13:25:19 2015 UTC,"This could work fine as long as you AC couple the input and output, but I'm guessing either /u/TomAskew is already doing this or is just lucky in that the equipment he's using doesn't care or his power supply isn't grounded which I doubt since it's an SMPS. That said throwing in AC coupling caps at the input and output tuned for a very low cutoff frequency is probably the easiest to understand way of going about this, but in that case you can probably do away with the virtual ground entirely if you get clean voltage from your power supply, and for these amounts of currents a linear regulator would be fine so this shouldn't be an issue."

Make sure the surface is as perfectly clean of dust as you can before applying, and as you trim flush, wipe the razor blade down with WD-40 to keep adhesive gum from building on the sides of the blade."

Happily, the vinyl material is fairly inexpensive and a single yard is probably MORE than you need, so when you cut your front baffles, cut a spare to test your methods on. :-D  This also seems like a method that would work best with removable front baffles.

If you disagree, you should hear what Andew Jones did for Pioneer for maybe $30 in materials cost.

Placing your speakers too close to a wall, hard wood flooring, lack of furniture, etc. are all things that can make the bass seem ""boomy."" I would suggest connecting your amp to the subwoofer channel only (isolating the other speakers) and testing them out of few different placements/room configurations. $2000 speakers will still sound like shit in a cave. If NONE of that works, I would suggest taking the crossovers you have and shifting the lower crossover point to something near 150 Hz.

The Bottlehead stuff means (to me, anyway) that you are pretty serious, so I might recommend an inexpensive but very efficient kit. Don't know how you feel about single drivers, but some of the Fostex kits are very efficient, look good, and look easy to build - should work very well with single ended amps. Check out Madisound, Meniscus, Parts Express, Speaker City, Zalytron, etc for kits and parts. If you want to buy, there are many brands - Klipsch is well known, JBL, Zu, maybe Silverline, etc.   Matching components requires some test equipment like a LCR meter, DMM, and if you are measuring speakers, a calibrated mic, good quality audio interface/audio card, and software of your choice. It's a lot of work but it's worth it when everything works out.  Recommendations? Looks to me like you are on the right path!

I've owned a pair of CSS FR125FR full range drivers, and many smaller 3"". I've heard little Tang Bands & Auras and bigger Fostex. All of them do it, the 3"" simply to a lesser degree.

Anyway, instead, we have diaphragms that vibrate in and out. As those diaphragms get bigger, the sound they generate becomes more and more directional at high frequencies. The larger they get, the lower the frequency this begins to occur at. More and more of the sound beams from the cone. It's why we need tweeters at all.

Something like a single 5 inch driver and a tweeter per speaker plus an external sub?  Also, what would make more sense for something like a small home theater? Something like this or something like this? Price differences aside that is"
diyaudio,349z63,ftbghs,2,Wed Apr 29 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"The sweet spot will depend on your room and distance from the speakers, but generally, the sweet spot will be with the Fostex toed-in, pointed directly at your head.  If you listen alone, that's fine. You can tune the system for one exact spot of awesomeness. But in building a home theater, remember this that every seat should be a good seat. On the sofa, to the side in a beanbag chair, everywhere. It's not something that full rangers excel at, but a well-designed 2-way with clever crossover...does.   Funny you should mention the Tritrix. If you purchase without cabs, there are alternate cabinet topologies available, including a much smaller sealed cabinet that should integrate better with a subwoofer. There's also a single-woofer variant that works well as a surround speaker."

Also, do the Tritrix require a subwoofer? I know they are MTM, but since I'm fairly new to this I don't fully understand what that means. If I had to guess though, since they are two midrange drivers and a tweeter, I would need one, right?"

I found that the best cables for the money are coax cables made for digital a/v transmission and I went with Belden 1505F + Pro Signal RCA plugs (if you decide to get a cable like this, make sure the connectors you buy can accept the large cable diameter!). Otherwise, there are a few pro audio brands which make very good cables suitable for this purpose, sometimes even specially designed for this such as Sommer Cable SC-Sinus-Control.

Also, you can try downloading a RTA app for your phone and playing some pink noise through the speakers.  You'll get a rough idea if you're seeing some really early roll off - If you're saying clock radio, I'm imagining roll off starting at ~ 1000hz.  If your woofers are out of phase with your tweeters, you'll see a big dip around the crossover point.  Have you tried a different amp?"

I tested it first with a lapai 2020 first as I didn't want to blow my yamaha if something was amiss and both had similar results.  The tweeters in the ZX are intentionally out of phase with the woofers by Paul's design. I've double checked that they are hooked up according to the schematic.  I have not tried one at a time yet. I'll try that one first when I get home.

I guess part of the problem is going from old Pioneer 4 way speakers with 2x12"" woofers in each and expecting to get a full sound from the single 6.5"".  Would crossover parts make much of a difference? Paul's design used air core inductor for the woofer side while the Menisucus kit came with an iron core (3.3 DCR vs .93DCR). I had contemplated redoing the woofer side of the crossover with better parts to eek out whatever I can. I guess I should start saving my change for a sub."

As a start, I would try using a two speaker setup (one source, one cancellation) and see if you can at least get a -3db or -6db reduction directly behind the cancellation speaker. IMO the best you can hope for (wildly optimistic) is maybe a -12db max reduction in the bass frequencies, enough to make it quieter/less annoying but you'll never get it to be silent. You'll have the best luck if there's a highway nearby or something else to provide a 24/7 high noise floor your audio can hide behind. If you live in a quiet rural area/suburb you're screwed.  I think a much better idea is a network of small satellite speakers that can run relatively quietly instead of a loud-as-hell point source for covering a decent area, though this might necessitate delay lines depending on the size of the area/desired sound quality.  Maybe someone else can provide a more theoretical grounding."

diyaudio,33pfq4,judgejuddhirsch,2,Fri Apr 24 12:51:46 2015 UTC,"So the size of the port and length does matter. Basically the port resonates, the amplitude/freq of this resonance is based on it's length and diameter. So cutting this shorter may induce some unwanted resonance at a potentially bad frequency (mid bass coloration)"
diyaudio,33pfq4,bab5871,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"Will cutting shorter tubes will ruin response, even if I add a second tube to give the same overall length (and volume and surface area) as a single tube? What about a single shorter tube of wider diameter?     I like the bend idea, but is there a relationship between port tube volume and length that I should aim for?"
diyaudio,33pfq4,bab5871,2,Fri Apr 24 13:45:36 2015 UTC,"If you use a shorter tube it needs to be a smaller diameter. I've heard of people using a single 1"" port that's 4 inches in length instead of the 1 3/8""@6"". The tuning I believe these are going for (and someone PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong) is 53Hz? Also I'm pretty sure these are meant to be stuffed because the calculations to get 53Hz tuning with a 6"" port are off for a ~4.5L volume. Stuffing it would make the internal volume roughly ~5.5L and fall in line with a 1 3/8""@6"" port size."
diyaudio,33pfq4,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"so what causes the port to affect resonance frequency (which is the same as tuning, right?)? Is it the movement of air through the tube or the pressure difference from fast moving air inside the tube compared to outside the tube as the woofer compresses air in the box? This should cause the tube to vibrate, just like an airfoil, and if its the proper size/length, should cause the box to vibrate to. Or is air movement not a factor, just the extension of box volume? By resonate, I assume that at 53Hz the box itself will excite and start to vibrate and produce its own noise?  So if I go for the bend, am I trying to preserve the original tube volume, surface area, or path of air? This could could influence the size/shape of the elbow."
diyaudio,33pfq4,lutkeveld,8,Fri Apr 24 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"Ports are helmholtz resonators. The volume of the air in the port and the volume of the box work together to decide the resonance of the system. It's important to think of the two things as linked. If you increase the box volume, the port lengths decrease to maintain the same ratio. Therefore, if you shorten the ports but maintain the box size, the tuning of the system will rise.   It's all very much like blowing over the top of a coke bottle. Drinking more soda increases the port length, so the sound gets lower.   Around port tuning frequency in a speaker, the air pressure inside the enclosure rises significantly, limiting the woofer's back-and-forth movement. But that's okay. At that frequency, the system wants to ""hum"" all on its own and the majority of the system's output issues from the port. It also raises the power handling of the system because now the woofer can't flop about too much.  All woofers will roll off on the bottom end at a rate of about 12dB/oct. Where that roll-off occurs, and how the woofer behaves just before roll-off will vary from driver to driver based on its specifications. What a ported box does is use a resonance to ""prop up"" the response and extend the system's response lower than the woofer would be able to achieve on its own. Tune too low, and the port's contribution will occur too late to be of much use. Tune too high, and the port and the woofer will work TOO well together, creating very boomy, very ""chesty"" bass.   Again, what matters is the volume of air inside the port. If you use an elbow, you will need to find the volume of air. I would suggest purchasing the elbow, filling it with rice, and then pouring that rice into a measuring cup. Do your measurements in metric, because mL are cubic centimeters and it's much easier to do math when all your systems are based upon a base-10 equivalency.   Measure the INSIDE diameter of the 1-3/8"" tube because we don't want to have wall thickness as a factor. Measure it in cm, or convert as needed. Divide by two to get radius. Then get the volume of the cylinder of the original port:  V=π r2 * h  I'll save you the google conversion lookup. 6"" is 15.24cm.  Once you have the volume of the original cylinder, subtract the volume you measured for the elbow. That tells you how long the remaining straight piece of the tube needs to be."
diyaudio,33pfq4,bab5871,3,Fri Apr 24 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"Search for Helmholtz resonance. That's the principal a bassreflexport is based on. If you make it shorter, tuning will be higher and you get a midbass peak and earlier bass rolloff. Try to keep area and length the same as originally intended."
diyaudio,33pfq4,Elaborate_vm_hoax,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:29:13 2015 UTC,"Air movement is a factor, do some googling on speaker port velocity, there's a lot to read! As far as a bent port, I'm not sure how much the tube path matters, I have seen 90's, 45's etc. That being said You need to measure from from the center around the bend, if I recall a bend will make the tube ""longer"" so you might have to cut it a little shorter. Port tubes are referred to by their inside diameter. So if you add couplers and what not you may end up increasing the ID over a specific length which might require a longer tube.    I didn't ask this before... you can't just pop the back off and make a new one with the port hole in a different spot? :)"

diyaudio,33pfq4,MYNAMEISNOTSTEVE,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:28:12 2015 UTC,"If you use a second tube, you are effectively increasing the cross-section of the port, not its length. That will make things even worse.  Putting a bend in the port tube is the simplest solution."
diyaudio,33pfq4,prozackdk,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, the problem stuck with me and I had to solve it.  The original plan calls for a 6"" x 1.4"" ID.  The relationship between length and width is: L=Xr2- sqrt(2)r where L and r are length and radius, and X is a constant If I broke the tube in half, the new radius would be r2=0.502, or a new ID of about 1"". This is rather far below the minimum acceptable diameter, but it exists just in case. And if anyone wants to use two pipes instead of one, the diameters of the smaller pipes are related to that of the larger by pythogorians theorem: dlarge2=d12 + d22."

diyaudio,33lqzb,leica_boss,3,Thu Apr 23 16:27:38 2015 UTC,Here are some subwoofer plate amps that would give you a solid power supply. It's not cheap per-se and it would probably be a waste to spend that much to power a cheap sub. I'd be wary of spending anything to drive that sub if you're looking at upgrading fairly soon. When you upgrade you can get an amp and sub that work well together and come out with better results.
diyaudio,33lqzb,MasterBettyFTW,2,Thu Apr 23 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"Used Crown amplifier (craigslist/ebay)  Keep in mind for a Pro/PA amp, you might need an unbalanced/balanced converter to eliminate ground noise and/or get the level correct. $50 or so.  A subwoofer plate amp, on sale, would come close to that price. More expensive but easier solution and no need for converter.  Another option is to get an amplifier board/chips on ebay, and source a large enough power transformer, and build you own power amplifier. Keep in mind 500va+ transformers are expensive, as are decent looking aluminum enclosures to put the components in. You'd be close or at the cost of a plate amp."

You could get the voice coils replaced, but you would have to find a place that will do it for you and it'll likely be expensive.  I don't know that I would do that myself either.  Replacing the driver is actually a pretty good idea and you can likely find something fairly similar.  Are there any specs on the back of the driver?  Like a sticker on the magnet that specifies the impedance (Ohm) and the sensitivity (db/m/w) ?  The sensitivity is pretty important when trying to match a driver.  If you end up with a replacement driver that's a lot more or less sensitive, it'll sound like junk and you will have wasted your hard earned Euros."
diyaudio,33kqsh,NCSeb,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:38:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. All that's listed on the driver is the impedance and eltax part number, no sensitivity, but I'll have to replace both so maybe matching it to the original isn't so crucial? unless it also has to be matched to the tweeters or enclosure..."
diyaudio,33kqsh,NCSeb,3,Thu Apr 23 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"The sensitivity is important in matching a woofer with a tweeter, so it definitely will be important.  Think of the sensitivity as being the volume at which a driver will play for a fixed volume setting on your amp.  Now if you tweeter outputs 89db at 1 watt and your woofer also outputs 89db at 1 watt, the sound will be homogeneous between the highs and the lows.  Now if you replace the woofer by one that will only produce 80db at 1 watt, now your tweeters will sound a lot louder than your woofers when listening to music.  That's what you want to avoid.  The crossover circuit in the speaker is there to ensure that the drivers have a similar frequency response  based on the measured raw drivers frequency response across the spectrum.  So that circuit  is really built specifically to the specs of the driver it will be connected to.  That's why it's important to get as close a replacement as possible (and that's why they gouge you on the price of replacement drivers).  From looking at pictures of those speakers on the web, I think I noticed that they are flush mounted with the cabinets.  That's going to be anther issue since their outer edge isn't spherical.  The straight cut on the edge of the driver will be very hard to find in a driver.  I know peerless makes some, but the cut doesn't exactly look like the one that's on those drivers."

However, I don't think there's going to be a more economical solution than Mission 733's at €70, and the Eltax speakers aren't that special that they're worth fixing, sadly. At least it'll teach me to be more careful next time...  Thanks again!  edit: hello fellow motorcyclist!"

diyaudio,33kokz,array_repairman,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"The first one is designed for connecting instruments to an amplifier, and would be most appropriate to your use. It's shielded (important when it's signal will be amplified), and likely more flexible than the 14-gauge wire.  The second one is for connecting a speaker to an amplifier. It's designed to handle around 1000 watts of power, but likely isn't shielded (not necessary for speaker-level cable). While this cable would work, you might get audible interference."

Speaker level signals would probably smoke that cable.  Speaker cables are meant to connect power amplifiers to passive cabinets, probably up to a couple hundred watts. Much more power you probably want Speakon. If you use them for an instrument/line signal, you likely will get induced interference. Yes, that it is 14/2 makes it speaker cable."

The bass is going to drop off fast, so you need to EQ them for best results.  The phase alignment on the drivers isn't very good the way they are mounted. Offset the woofer drivers so their cones are aligned. Like this.  The Ess Heil baffle seems too small, Here is a simulation tool for open baffle that will help you fine-tune the baffle size."

diyaudio,33k6ce,benedictishii,3,Thu Apr 23 04:22:52 2015 UTC,"The left circuit will work.   The right circuit will not work. Diodes will distort your signal (signals below ~0.7V will not be passed at all). However, if you replace the diodes with resistors (perhaps, 10k or so), then it will be a passive summer (the output will be a blend of the two inputs, as long as only one preamp is outputting at a time, this will be fine).  Wire gauge: doesn't matter. 24AWG is a nice size, but again, not crucial.  Wooden cabinet: ideally, line the box with foil and ground the foil. Your jacks should have grounding lugs, so use those."
diyaudio,33k6ce,uint128_t,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I'll give the right circuit a rethink.  If I get what you're saying about adding resistors instead of diodes, both of the left signals from both amps will be summed into the left output of the box, but since only one of the amps will be producing any signal, it should be fine.  I added the diodes because I thought they would protect the amps. I thought that damage might occur if the output of one of the amps was sent into the output of the other. Perhaps this isn't something to worry about, though? Just curious, what is the point of the resistors at all?  Thanks again. You've been a big help."
diyaudio,33k6ce,esquilax,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the resistors are necessary, because otherwise you'd be driving the output of the other amp as much as the input of the downstream amp, which could cause damage depending on how your amps are constructed."

They have the advantage that they can be easily controlled via software, since you're just flipping an output pin high or low. With it, you wouldn't have to worry about finding the correct switch, just do it via software, and have some kind of interfacing with the raspberry. I'm not sure how you're doing it, but since it's software, it can be anything: an app in your phone, a command line through serial/ethernet/webserver, or a couple of pushbuttons.  I haven't used volumio, and I don't know exactly what you're going to do and how many sources, so it might be a bit overkill.  A good thing about using the mux, though, is that you can use a simple rotary encoder-type of switch (like this ), which is cheap and fairly easy to come across.  I only know of the 4051 and the 4052 off the top of my head, not sure how well they do in audio, but I'm sure there are better analog muxes for audio, probably even for stereo."

There's only one wire going to each of the rows of speakers the way it's drawn and it's not super clear what's your +70V and your Common on the output. That said, I'll assume for this post that there's a 70V and a 0V wire running on each ""row"", the power tap on the line transformer to the 70V rail and the finish of the primary to the 0V rail, and the 8 Ohm speaker wired across the 8 Ohm secondary?  Here's a nice whitepaper/appnote from Crown about constant voltage audio distribution systems that might help you troubleshoot: http://www.crownaudio.com/media/pdf/amps/138905-1_10-05_constant_voltage.pdf It has wiring diagrams and such.  If everything is legitimately wired correctly, I'd suspect a defective speaker transformer that shorts out your system after some time. Start off by making sure you don't have any random shorts in your cable runs, though. Disconnect all the transformers from the distribution lines, and disconnect the distribution lines from the amplifier. Measure the resistance between the distribution lines. With everything disconnected at both ends, you should have an open circuit/no reading. If you get a reading, you have a short circuit in your wiring somewhere.  Moving on, measure the DC resistance of every speaker transformer's primary while disconnected from the distribution lines. They should all be pretty close to one another in resistance, if you find one that's vastly different, it's likely bad.  Let us know what you find."

Lepai 2020. 20w per channel, 12v input, extremely popular amp, many boomboxes and speaker projects made using this cheap amp (google search will reveal heaps of projects) . Quite large though. (search ebay or Amazon or literally anywhere).  As for bluetooth, I have only heard good things about the sure module. I have one myself and can assure you it's sound and build quality is very good. The main benefit for this module is it runs directly off a 12v circuit. Many other bt modules run on 5v,and so you need to build a voltage step down circuit for them,and they often ""buzz"".  http://store.sure-electronics.com/audio/aa-ab41136  Anyway, I hope that's remotely helpful and you managed to read it all.

diyaudio,336sg8,krumpinjugger,3,Mon Apr 20 04:40:04 2015 UTC,Parts express is the most widely known. They have some pretty good guides too IIRC and might have some with metal dust covers. Don't go overboard. You should be able to get good drivers for $10-15 each. The drivers should also come with Thiel/Small numbers. With that data you can modify the port for the best sound. I think some enclosure calculators  will take passive radiators into account too.  Edit: Enclosure calculators.

diyaudio,331q7c,kclo4,2,Sun Apr 19 08:04:16 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/ilpGpNj That's the same left speaker measured in room, on axis with and without the WG in place.  The blue trace is with the WG. you can see a large gain in  the 2.5-5.5kHz range and some taming of that 12 kHz peak. Also interesting is that the THD and harmonic products within this range (not shown) are about a the same level for each case, meaning the distortion at least is a good 12-18 db down from the program material at this range.  This also happens to be the range where tweeters have the most distortion, i.e. the lower end of the crossover.  With this setup and this tweeter, you could cross over as low as 1 kHz with a 2nd order crossover and be fine!  This is crossed over at about 2kHz with a first order (plus filters) because these speakers are so well behaved.  The crossover is not my design BTW."

diyaudio,333kip,AndrewLucksNeckBeard,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"Here's my idea for what you equipment you have.  1) Buy 2 crossover networks on parts express. The crossover network is located between your speakers and the amp in your signal chain. These limit the audio frequencies sent to each speaker to get the best performance out of each driver.  http://www.parts-express.com/dayton-audio-xo2w-2k-2-way-speaker-crossover-2000-hz--260-140  2) Next, and very important if you're making a boombox, separate your left and right speakers with some kind of barrier. Each speaker works to push air, and you don't want them interfering with each other.   3) Making your enclosure. Since you have some random parts here it's really hard to decide you enclosure to use. Cars speakers are generally meant for infinite baffle (open back) designs. Could you find the model numbers maybe?   Rules for making the box:       a) Bigger = better.      b) Keep the inner dimensions unequal (width, length and height). A 1:1.618:0.618 is optimum to cancel standing waves within your enclosure. A perfect cube is the worst enclosure design ever.     c) IF you do a sealed or ported design, line the inside of you enclosure with foam. 1in. thick quilting foam from Walmart will do.    4) Set up your amp, crossovers, and speakers before building and make you know how they all go together.    5) Get a bigger battery. A boombox isn't really portable if it only lasts 90 minutes."

diyaudio,332381,substrate80,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:17:09 2015 UTC,I've considered that but it seems to me that building/finding a highly transparent active xover would be equally difficult/expensive.

diyaudio,332381,substrate80,2,Sun Apr 19 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"I find designing an active crossover to be easier, because you don't have to worry about zobel networks and it's easier to do sensitivity matching with an active.  If you're building a three-way design, a passive crossover can be expensive because the inductors become quite large.    I typically use 24 db/octave Linkwitz-Riley alignment.    I have built my own using circuit boards available from Elliot Sound Products:  http://sound.westhost.com/projects-0.htm#xvr  http://sound.westhost.com/project09.htm  Project 09 is an active 2-way or 3-way Linkwitz Riley crossover.  This design uses potentiometers for level matching.  I'm not a huge fan of potentiometers, and would rather use stepped attenuators, if the budget allows.  I have purchased the Marchand Electronics XM44, which uses stepped attenuators and has replaceable modules to allow you to change the crossover frequency.  It's great.  http://www.marchandelec.com/xm44.html  You can get a balanced (XLR connectors) input/output option, which is what I have."

diyaudio,3302db,AhrenGxc3,3,Sat Apr 18 04:44:05 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you want to take a frequency response measurement of your speakers.  You'll need a measurement mic like Behringer's ecm8000. It's pretty flat and calibration files are easy to come by. For software you could use REW or HOLM impulse, both are good though there are plenty of alternatives. These programs generate a sine wave sweep which the mic records, the software then shows various frequency and phase plots of the results. For a complete sweep of the system you will generally want to take the measurement at around 1 meter from the tweeter (on axis), also only measure 1 speaker cabinet at a time. You will of course also need an amp and a sound card. Try to take the measurements as far away from reflective surfaces as possible, inside is fine if the room is fairly large but outside away from buildings is better. You can use gating to limit the frequency plot to a certain distance so that (for example) reflections further away than the distance between your mic and the speaker are discounted, this provides a more accurate picture of your speakers.  If you are making a measurement indoors be aware that sound below 300 hz is not usually accurate at 1 meter due to room modes so the usual method is to place the mic 1/4 inch from the bass driver and stitch the response with the 1 meter overall plot. Any bass ports/vents should also be measured and added to the response.  It's a bit of a crash course but i hope it helps."

With ported systems, 0.5m or 1.0m ground plane is probably a more accurate description of output, especially with ports not adjacent to the woofer on the baffle. Point of radiation is most likely in front of the woofer and ports. When you do polars of lower frequency output you get a pattern at frequencies you shouldn't as it is supposed to be omni-direction radiation from the woofers surface or ports throat.

More formally, it decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or, equivalently, complex exponentials). The Discrete-time Fourier transform is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series. The Z-transform, another example of application, reduces to a Fourier series for the important case |z|=1. Fourier series are also central to the original proof of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis.

You can tell if you're 'out of phase' by disconnecting one speaker entirely and listening again. If it sounds similar or louder with only one sub working, then you have a phase issue.  It's so very common in subs that almost all have a switch on that back that can swap them. Very much worth checking, as it has nothing at all to do with 'I wired them correctly.'

The software architecture isn't that well designed. At least using the LCD display. I've got a Mac which can't operate the amp via USB.     Go into the filter settings and turn the gain all the way up. And, like others have mentioned, set your low pass filter between 60-80 Hz. If the sub box is sealed you don't need to use the high-pass. If it's a vented/ported box and you push the subs hard, you might want to set the high-pass at 20Hz to protect them from damage. And  obviously turn up both gain knobs all the way.       If that doesn't fix the problem then tweak the PEQ. Try adding a couple db's of boost either side of the resonant frequency of the port if vented. If sealed, experiment with what sounds best.  And then there's the DEQ. I haven't needed to use this but be careful adding too much boost with either EQ.      Lastly, if all that doesn't work, take the subs out of the box and make sure you've wired the voice coils correctly. Big difference between a 2 and 8 ohm current draw"
diyaudio,32w1ix,TomAskew,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:40:59 2015 UTC,Try adding a couple db's of boost either side of the resonant frequency of the port if vented   The stonehenge sub box is ported and its resonant frequency is somewhere between 18 and 19 hz.  Probably don't want to add a few dbs below 18 hz.

diyaudio,32w1ix,Bermnerfs,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:29:28 2015 UTC,"Before scrapping your boxes, stop. Hold up.  I used to run a 15"" ported sub. 5.6 cubic feet, tuned to 21hz (it's sitting unused because of living arrangements). It was loud, yes, it would shake things, yes, but it certainly wasn't a tactile experience and I was about ready to scrap the thing and start over. Then I purchased a used Behringer Feedback Destroyer and set about taking measurements & applying some EQ. Here's the before (green) and after (purple):  http://i.imgur.com/vvb2c.jpg  (you can ignore the roll-off on the top octave, I had Room EQ Wizard's target set to 12dB/oct instead of 24dB/oct)  Those 5 filter cuts completely transformed the subwoofer. By getting rid of the ""boominess"" on top, the response became deep, powerful, and more than a little ominous.   The first thing you should really do at this point is, as you suspect, get some measurements. I cannot recommend Room EQ Wizard enough in this regard. It works wonderfully with the Radio Shack SPL meters (there are calibration files that will get the Rat Shack meter ""in the ballpark""). Only other things you need are some long RCA cables, some adaptors, and a quiet afternoon.   With measurements in hand, you can decide how to proceed. It may be a matter of room placement. It may be that you've got some boominess masking all the good stuff and an EQ is the way to go (these days, the miniDSP has taken over as the go-to parametric EQ device).  But measurements are definitely in order."

diyaudio,32vcnd,GeckoDeLimon,2,Fri Apr 17 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"That's actually one of the better uses for a full range. The RS100 makes a fairly good ""plop in a box"". It has a peak in the top octave that you may find to be a little shrill. However, it goes away when you aim the speakers away from your ears ever so slightly. So either experiment with the toe angle, or implement a small notch filter to smooth it out.   Some other value leaders in the price category:   Tang Band W3-881SJF. Very smooth response, T/S parameters that allow it to be used in a smallish ported box and produce more bass than you'd think (you'll still probably want a sub for full sound). It's been around a long time and is often overlooked. I've never been able to figure out why.  HiVi B3S / B3N. It's been a favorite in the community. Some people run them without any filters, others use a notch filter to clean up a bit of a peak around 7khz. I've heard both, and I feel like the ""notchless"" version sounded the same, but did make for a little ear fatigue after extended listening. Otherwise, extremely smooth response through the upper bass & midrange. Only downside is that a subwoofer is basically required since it gets very muddy when you near Xmax, and that happens fairly fast. The B3N has a more traditional round frame, but is otherwise identical. Vifa / Tympani TC9FD18. T/S params limit it to a sealed box, but the response is quite extended and the voicing is extremely neutral. It's got a sort of classic ""paper"" sound. I'm using it in my center channel and in my surrounds. If there's one thing I don't like about it, it's that it requires a little bigger of a box. Still a reasonable size for desktop use. I'm a big fan.   Yes, these drivers are significantly cheaper than $40, but they're also really damn good at what they do and a great place to start."

The RIAA equalization curve was intended to operate as a de facto global industry standard for records since 1954. However, it is almost impossible to say when the change actually took place.   Before then, especially from 1940, each record company applied its own equalization; there were over 100 combinations of turnover and rolloff frequencies in use, the main ones being Columbia-78, Decca-U.S., European (various), Victor-78 (various), Associated, BBC, NAB, Orthacoustic, World, Columbia LP, FFRR-78 and microgroove, and AES.

As you draw too much power, the voltage supplied to the whole amp will drop causing disasterous distortion. Keep that up and you'll either smoke the amp's power supply or blow a fuse somewhere.   In terms of blowing the actual output stage, drawing too much current is going to cause it to get hot. If it fails, it's going to be because there isn't enough heat dissipation going on (the transistor package itself may be inadequate, so no matter the size of your heatsink the overcurrent could melt the transistors inside). I strongly suspect though that you will run into power delivery issues before you run into blown output stage issues though (unless you short the output terminals of course). This is assuming you series your 3ohm speakers to make a 6 ohm nominal impedance (that nominal impedance figure literally means a measured resistanced of X ohms for a 1Khz sine wave)."

Also thanks to everybody else who contributed - I tried it, and it sounded OK at lowish volume - to be honest these are pretty small speakers and the sound isn't really going to cut it,   Having said that, seems the unit has a couple of defects anyway, and I've asked the seller to take it back. I'll probably look for one with matching speakers to avoid this problem."
diyaudio,32kf8t,TramStopDan,5,Tue Apr 14 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"I work in acoustics, and I think you might be over simplifying things. What you are talking about does sort of exist. You can get calibrators for sound level meters. These are small boxes which generate a set, known level of sound to affix to the top of a sound level meter in order to give confidence that the meter is measuring accurately. Typically these generate something like a 1kHz tone at ~94 dB at the point that the SLM microphone attaches.   I'm guessing this isn't what you want at all... I'm afraid to say what you want is impossible. There are so many things to consider. Firstly, you want to control the sound to a particular decibel rating... Do you mean at a particular frequency? Do you mean A-weighted or linear? Secondly once you generate the sound it will propagate, so where do you need it to be a ""known/calibrated"" level? The sound will be louder right next to source, and drop off according to geometric spreading and air absorption further away. So it's not ever going to give you one single level! You'd need to consider the environment you're generating the sound in, is it reverberant, free field etc, this will have a great affect on the resultant sound. I.e the same device would come across quieter in the middle of a field than, say, inside a small boxy room, where reflections reinforce the sound.  So you'd need not only a controlled source, but a controlled environment for that source, and even then it would only work for certain places within that environment.   What you need, for the purpose you're describing, is a sound level meter. A microphone which measures the level of the sound. You get one of these. Turn on any old speaker set up and just turn the dial until you're at the level you want to demonstrate.   I'd be happy to further explain if you'd like!   Source: MEng in Acoustical Engineering"

diyaudio,32kf8t,lutkeveld,2,Tue Apr 14 18:10:18 2015 UTC,It's better to work with Phons instead of deciBells for this purpose because of the inlinearity of the human hearing. If it's only at one frequency I would make a 555 circuit with a piezo buzzer and let it play a 1 or 10khz tone
diyaudio,32kf8t,ThickAsABrickJT,2,Tue Apr 14 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"Looking at what you want to do, here's what I see as your solution:   First, get an SPL meter.  The kind that looks like a microphone with a meter attached should work fine.  Don't use your phone.  Next, make a few recordings of the sound you want to demonstrate.  Be sure that your recording mic is in a proper listening location.  Place the SPL meter near your mic and write down the dB rating.  Now set up your demonstration area with a reasonably powerful stereo system and a well-defined listening area such as a couch or chair.  Put your SPL meter near where the listener's head will be and play back your recordings.  Adjust the volume until the meter matches the numbers you wrote down earlier.  Now, if you're going to be trying to demonstrate volume to a large group of people, this won't be a good idea.  You'll either have to make do by comparing to household noises or hire an audio engineer to rig up a way-too-expensive system."

It would be much better to try and angle the speakers more towards the listener. The radiation pattern of a speaker is somewhat similar to that of a cardoid microphone so use that as a rough guide for speaker orientation in relation to the user.   I STRONGLY suggest that you have internal volumes for each of the speakers. You are going to have some issues anyway because you are sharing so much geometry with different sources so that you will have coupling between the sources which will lead to interactions between them. See if you can contact zaph audio if you want to appropriate his 3inch driver design. It will be a good starting point for you.   Long story short, the speakers most likely won't sound very good due to the positioning and mounting of the speakers."

diyaudio,31zzq4,TheSnydaMan,5,Thu Apr 9 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"If you decide to build a single box for two subs (but only installing a single sub) then you need a solid divider in the middle. Otherwise, that single sub will see a box whose volume and tuning are all wrong for operating solo. It would be at great danger of over-excursion since there would be half as much air pressure inside the box as it was designed to work with (in layman's terms).    By using a divider, then you basically have two single-sub boxes glued together, with the tuning and volume appropriate for a single driver in each. Use the empty side to hold your spare tennis shoes, The solo sub will not care. Each sub is its own acoustic system.  It'll be a little harder to port (due to size limitations), but it's the only way to go without compromising the output & reliability of the single sub."

diyaudio,31zzq4,truls-rohk,4,Thu Apr 9 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"That is incorrect, the increased output has to do with doubling the drivers, whether they are in the same chamber or not has nothing to do with it."

diyaudio,31txrs,preternaturous,3,Wed Apr 8 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"You want a surround processor, like the Outlaw 975. It takes an HDMI input and gives you line level output for each channel. Unfortunately, most surround processors are pretty expensive and there aren't many companies that make them.  Also, how are you transmitting the signal? Are you just feeding the analog signal into the laser, or are you converting the signal to digital and pulsing the laser?"
diyaudio,31txrs,Wail_Bait,2,Wed Apr 8 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"""An audio output transformer pulses the laser to the audio waveform. It basically flashes the waveform aplitude through the laser light level output and the solar cell turns that back into electrical pulses in AC to drive the speakers"" is what my buddy says. So basically, we just need a way to separate each channel to run into each output transformer, to pulse each laser by its individual channel waveform."
diyaudio,31txrs,Wail_Bait,3,Wed Apr 8 04:27:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he's using pulse width modulation, which is exactly what I would do. Photodiodes should work better than solar cells, but I don't know if the difference would be noticeable. The difference is that the voltage from a solar cell changes slowly, but a photodiode can switch on and off very quickly."
diyaudio,31txrs,Ashbaernon,0,Wed Apr 8 05:03:55 2015 UTC,"That is what he's using. Photodiodes don't register the 650nm wavelength of the red lasers we're using. At least, we haven't been able to find any.   I'm thinking about just saying screw it, and forsaking my game consoles and just running the 7.1 Dolby 3.5mm outputs from my mobo directly into this system."
diyaudio,31txrs,Micjahjah,6,Wed Apr 8 05:19:10 2015 UTC,Driving a laser diode via an audio output transformer is not PWM. It's AM. It won't work properly because of the way diodes function and it will sound really (really) bad at low levels. In fact there will be a threshold at which only high amplitudes will power the laser meaning you've effectively created an opto gate.  What you're after is PCM. You need to convert the audio signal to PCM and deconvert it at the other end using a fast micro.  Also be wary of anyone walking in front of your beams. That would annoy me pretty quickly.  TBH this idea is riddled with potential issues and I think you'd be better off with RF transmitters/receivers.
diyaudio,31txrs,swrrga,2,Wed Apr 8 07:51:11 2015 UTC,"Its more about the novelty at this point.  We also have a band pass/high pass for the low end degradation, along with a dedicated powered subwoofer that will be wired directly.  The high amplitude issue doesn't really make sense after that. Plus it will have a dedicated 5v psu for the 7channel laser array so the lasers will be powered regardless of signal output, and when powered without signal the recieved will generate dc and therefore no sound.  Its also being run up the back wall behind the tv, across the ceiling with mirrors, and into receiving diodes.  Any other questions?"
diyaudio,31txrs,Micjahjah,3,Wed Apr 8 08:05:49 2015 UTC,"and when powered without signal the recieved will generate dc and therefore no sound   Nononononono!  You need to capacitively couple your speakers.   100 W AC into a 25 W speaker will be incredibly loud and sound horrible, causing a human to turn the system down immediately so there's no damage.  100 W DC into a 25W speaker will produce no sound, and you won't even know anything's amiss until you let the magic smoke out.  It may be that you already realize this, but it's not super clear from your wording. DC coupling is used for some 'audiophile' applications but there's a bunch of drawbacks in terms of protection circuitry needed."
diyaudio,31txrs,swrrga,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:38:40 2015 UTC,The laser reciever system produces like 2 volts dc at the most and its being eliminated by another transformer in the speaker to return the Line level input from the laser back to high level input for the speaker.

diyaudio,31txrs,qwnp,3,Thu Apr 9 00:02:22 2015 UTC,"Photodiodes don't register the 650nm wavelength of the red lasers we're using.   Most of them do. Photodiodes are usually labeled by their peak sensitivity, which is often near infrared around 950 nm. That does not mean that they don't work with other wavelengths though, it just means that you'll have reduced sensitivity. For example, this datasheet shows a peak sensitivity at 850 nm, and a relative sensitivity of 70% at 650 nm."

That is no fault of the OS, but because it is a great first project, a lot of people build it and it really is the best thing they've ever owned. A $350 DIY project is about as far removed from the OS as the OS is from, I dunno, tiny HTIB cubes and horrible vehicle acoustics.   Add to that that this may be the first time people are taking an active role in listening, and they'll hear things they never heard before. If the OS delivers that experience, I can understand how it gained such a mythic reputation. It really is a good first place to start. And a lot of people find themselves content with ""really good"" instead of ""great"".  As far as ""open and dynamic"", the one thing I've come to believe is that small woofers have a very hard time energizing a room the way a large cone does, regardless of how much excursion is available. The small surface area of the cone isn't in contact with as much air, and that difference in coupling is a big part of why larger woofers (and horns) are way more exciting to listen to."

diyaudio,31orri,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:23:06 2015 UTC,It is very easy to drive at 92db sensitivity.  Very elegant design by Jim Holtz who also designed the Statements.  It uses affordable drivers made in indonesia designed by ex-ScanSpeak engineers so it is definitely HiFi and not crass stupid loud typeof speaker  AND its on sale... the only difficult part is the routing of gje baffle for those woofers.
diyaudio,31orri,jonesey1955,2,Tue Apr 7 14:42:12 2015 UTC,"Design by Jim, but crossover by Curt Campbell. He's the crossover and voicing wizard behind half of the designs mentioned in this thread.

diyaudio,31orri,kokyunage,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:42:20 2015 UTC,I wonder if that could somehow be accomplished without countersinking or a router?
diyaudio,31orri,swrrga,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"I cheat countersinking by cutting larger holes on 5mm boards and stick It over the baffle to provide countersinking.  For this, I reccomend finding a CNC shop to route the baffle for you.  Don't forget to roundover the through holes on the back to improve airflow for these small midwoofers."

diyaudio,31jre8,TehEmperorOfLulz,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:35:33 2015 UTC,Yep. This is what I found. I just used some electrical tape.  http://i.imgur.com/IJII9ln.jpg
diyaudio,31jre8,renesys,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:57:02 2015 UTC,"The electrical tape won't do shit. This is a bit of a fire hazard. The loose connectors go resistive and you burn power at the connector instead of in the speaker coil. I've seen lots of speaker terminals vaporize from this issue.   Open it up again, pull off the fast-on connector, take some pliers and squeeze them so they are a snug fit on the male connector.  If the other fast-on connectors are loose, carefully remove them without breaking the fiberboard mount, and do the same thing.   They should have gone to PCB and real connectors years ago. It's pretty sad, really."
diyaudio,31jre8,influxrye,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"Could be a loose wire (they'll be connected in series more than likely so the wire may be before the middle driver), blown crossover or broken drivers (if the middle one is faulty the top one may not receive a signal).

If you plan on coating the speaker drivers themselves with it, make sure to reapply more often than the wood, or at least check them more often for reassurance, as the vibrations of the speaker might mess with the lasting of Neverwet. I'd go with waterproof sealant and plastic speaker cones for longevity.  Apart from all that, why bother? As long as you seal the box that the speakers are sat in properly, and as long as the drivers are polysomethingorother, plastic, water shouldn't hurt em until it gets to the insides."

diyaudio,31f75k,andrewcooke,2,Sun Apr 5 12:17:14 2015 UTC,"first, do all those actually appear on the board?  there's a lot of, well, varied opinions, about output capacitors.  the circuit shows two capacitors in parallel (on each side) for any of these possible reasons:   so that you can use two smaller capacitors that give the same total capacitance when added together.  the idea here is that you get a lower esr (resistance) for the same capacitance so that you can use two smaller capacitors that give the same total capacitance when added together, but this time to use physically smaller capacitors that fit in the box. so that you can use a capacitor of the size you want, plus a smaller one of a different type to improve high frequencies.  see  http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/21686/whats-the-purpose-of-two-capacitors-in-parallel   in short, it depends how much of an ""audiophile"" you are (for some value of ""audiophile"").  at the simplest, you want one of those capacitors on each channel (eg C13 and C14), leaving the other pair of contacts open.  and really, that's all i would do.  edit: again, i'm no expert.  but those are the only reasons i can think of.  maybe someone will confirm."

Here's one that's relevant: http://diyaudioprojects.com/Schematics/Mullard-SE-EL84-Tube-Amp-Schematic.htm  It sort of depends on the output transformer that you have, too - I'm assuming it's a single-ended type (as most were).    play old radio broadcasts off of.

The drivers used are simply better.   I built the kit posted above and powered with a dayton dta-120. I didn't have access the tools to build the enclosures so a knock down kit was a must for me.
diyaudio,31d6zu,killwish,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:49:59 2015 UTC,you happy with the tritrix??  that was actually the next on the list - i like the design and the parts themselves make sense:  whats your 1 - 10 rating?
diyaudio,31d6zu,killwish,2,Sat Apr 4 09:49:58 2015 UTC,I dont have enough experience with other speakers to give a rating. Value wise they are hard to beat when its comes to kits with a knock down enclosure. If you have access to the woodworking tools and can build the enclosures you save money across the board so that may justify spending more on the amiga.   Next year I would like to build linkwitz's LXmini.

diyaudio,3153am,supergrover2_0,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:39:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do this. Every cable has a characteristic impedance determined by its physical properties (including diameter) and when you bring two cables with different characteristics together you're going to have reflections, particularly in the high frequency domain, because of the impedance mismatch. This may or may not be audible but I wouldn't do it as a matter of course if you have another option. Think of the way light bends when it hits water, the deflection caused by differing indices of refraction between water and air is a similar phenomenon to the impedance mismatch caused by bringing to different waveguides (essentially what a cable is) together without properly impedance matching them.   TL;DR - don't do it"
diyaudio,3153am,will592,7,Thu Apr 2 02:38:27 2015 UTC,So do you open your speakers and rewire the internal connections with the same wire you are using externally?  The characteristic impedance of speaker wire can be ignored at 20 kHz.  This is transmission line theory and isn't relevant at audible frequencies over lengths that the OP is discussing.
diyaudio,3153am,Elviswind,3,Thu Apr 2 11:42:05 2015 UTC,Everybody listen to this person! Speaker wire DOES NOT MATTER. I dare you to Google it and read some blind test results before replying.
diyaudio,3153am,meezun,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:29:58 2015 UTC,That's not what he's saying. He's saying that transmission line theory does not apply at audio frequencies. So you don't need to worry about impedance mismatch in your speaker cables.
diyaudio,3153am,Fudge-alpaca,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. Speaker wire does matter. However, it doesn't matter to the extent that some people would like us to believe."

diyaudio,3153am,Fudge-alpaca,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:49:17 2015 UTC,It still matters in that you need a certain thickness but after that it doesn't really matter at all. I use mains cable as it's cheap
diyaudio,3153am,toroidalinductor,0,Thu Apr 9 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"No, I don't open up my speakers and replace anything inside. I use speakers with published specs measured after the unit is assembled and is presented to me as a 4 ohm load with characteristics specified on the data sheet. You and I both know that there is no perceptible impact to changing anything in the cabling of audio systems as long as the conductor is rated properly for the current it is carrying and it is properly shielded. Maybe I confused this sub with the audiophile subs I frequent but in general people are talking about the effects that changing opamps and power cables have on the sound of their hifi. Is transmission line math negligible on the audible frequency domain - absolutely. But negligible is not the same as non-zero. If someone were worried about which opamp is used in their CD player or whether or not physical vibration from walking is going to affect their power supplies then they should be worrying about reflections in their speaker cables. Should they worry about any of that; no, probably not. But one follows logically from the other. Like I said, I thought this post was in a different sub.   Having said that, I don't know why you would introduce anything half-ass into your signal path. It doesn't really hurt anything to follow best practice cable techniques and I don't think having a butt splice with a change in wire diameter is ever something I'd consider best practice. You know the specs of your amp, you know the specs of your speaker, you know the specs of a single length of cable. Why would you introduce something in the middle of your signal path that you don't know the characteristics of? Do you try to make sure you use the same length of cable for each speaker when you wire a stereo pair? You certainly don't need to at typical room dimensions but I do my best to make them equal length because, honestly, why the hell not. Because of my previous lab experience I try to impedance match signal cables whenever I make a connection - it's almost always unnecessary but why not just do it? It doesn't harm anything and it gives me a certain pride in a job well done. Ask an electrician why they leave all of the screws in a wall plate cover with the drives in the same orientation and they'll probably tell you the same thing - because that's just how a professional does if. I can tell if an amateur wired an outlet because they don't care how the wires are packed in the jbox and the faceplate screw is just turned in as far as it will go. Does it matter? It does and it doesn't."
diyaudio,3153am,will592,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:35:16 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't. As somebody else mentioned the reliability  of the connection is the biggest concern but if he can live with how it looks and that's all he has then there's no reason not too"
diyaudio,3153am,will592,2,Thu Apr 9 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Like what you said High Frequency domain this stuff matters a lot.

diyaudio,3153am,Elviswind,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:07:39 2015 UTC,"This was so beautifully written I almost cried. It makes perfect sense.  So then the question that begs asking is if it is worth trying to make a 16awg cable work for this whole run? I know I am right on the edge of what is suggested. If I had a high end set-up I wouldn't think twice. This project sounds very nice, but I am wondering if it has the fidelity to hear the difference between 18awg and 16awg cable at 13-15ft?"
diyaudio,3153am,EmmEff,2,Thu Apr 2 03:26:21 2015 UTC,"At that difference you will most likely hear an audible difference based on wire gauge. If you are running 8 ohm speakers you can probably get by with 16 AWG wire but if they are 4 ohm speakers you will be in big trouble. Maximum recommended distance for 16 AWG purely for reasons of resistive losses is around 15 feet at 8 ohms. I would highly recommend going with 14 AWG for those distances if you're looking for fidelity, especially if you're talking 4 ohm speakers"

diyaudio,30pp17,xqxcpa,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:00:56 2015 UTC,I'm not a tech and have very limited experience with this but here's what i'd do.  Open the amp up so that you can see all the components. Make sure you aren't grounded to anything. Turn the amp on and use a pair of wood chopsticks to tap the components.. Hopefully you'll see/hear the problem.. Watched a tech find the problem in one of my amps that way and have used this method to find problems and repair a few amps..
diyaudio,30pp17,pissoffa,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"Huh.  I was hoping for a method involving an oscilloscope or multimeter, but I guess I'll consider wooden chopsticks as last resort."

One thing you CAN test with a meter is DC offset. This is the amount of quiescent DC current that flows through the speaker outputs when a load is connected.   Disconnect everything from the amp and set your DMM to DC current. Turn on the amplifier, let it stabilize for a minute, and measure across the speaker terminals. If it's more than a few tens of milliamps (or there's a notable disparity between the left and right) thats a sure sign things are going bad internally.   Without having the amp in front of me, I'd guess one or more capacitors have gone tits up, possibly coupling capacitors."

Do not get distracted by other Lepai products. The LP2020 is a diamond in the rough. The others are just...rough.   Alternately, any old used home theater or stereo receiver will do the job for you. The advantage here is that you'll gain a remote control, significantly more power, and maybe even the ability to go full 5.1 surround sound later on. Solid used receivers go for not much more thsn the Lepai. In fact, if you lived anywhere near Green Bay WI, I'd sell you a three year old Pioneer for $50.  Lets talk cables. If you like option A, then you will need a male-to-male 3.5mm cable (just like you'd use to plug a phone into a car's aux jack). If you like option B, it should be a 3.5mm to RCA cable.

diyaudio,30i1qd,cyandyedeyecandy,2,Sat Mar 28 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"if this is high frequency noise then it's not really the size of the capacitor that's the problem - it's the type.  the 100uF capacitors you are looking at are electrolytic cans, i guess. the trouble is that they're not so great at very high frequencies. what you need is something like a 0.1 uF ceramic (in addition to what is already there).  see for example http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/jun97/basics.html  i think you could probably stick it across the opamp (you have a typo - you say ""on the capacitor themselves"" where i am pretty sure you mean ""on the opamps themselves"")."

Yup, the squeal is around the 7-8 khz rane from what I can hear.  For the ceramic capacitor, I'm still new to this whole electrical DIY stuff, so i'm not sure what makes a good cap.   I know how to pick out things based on their voltage, capacitance and resistance. however, many companies have lots of different models with more or less the same base specs, and from what I read on the internet, all these models actually have their own sound?  Is that true? or is it another case of audiophile snakeoil peddling?"

diyaudio,30dbsc,AUX1_Dub,6,Thu Mar 26 13:26:33 2015 UTC,"That's not how a crossover works. If you have an 8 ohm woofer and an 8 ohm horn, the crossover splits it up. At high frequencies, the amplifier only ""sees"" the horn, and at low frequencies, it only sees the woofer. To be slightly more technical, at low frequencies, crossover raises the tweeter's impedance from the 8 ohms nominal to 16 ohms, 40 ohms, and higher (as the frequency drops). Same idea with the woofer. So take an 8 ohm load and a 40 ohm load and put them in parallel, and you'll see it's nowhere near 4 ohms. You get the idea.  Your horn will not only distort, but probably be destroyed by running full range. So you had better worry about it.  Do you have just two channels of amplification?   And what drivers? We need model numbers and specs, including the dimensions of the horn and the compression driver."

diyaudio,30dbsc,cosmicdog,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"Yes you can just put a high pass on the horn and be fine. That will protect your horn driver from the lower frequencies. Somewhere around 1200Hz is the most common. Your driver should have a ""recommend crossover"" spec. This will not solve your impedance issue, however. It will still be 8ohms. If you built two per side and wired them in parallel (+ to +, - to -) on each side, that would come to 4ohms. You can't change the impedance of the speaker driver with a crossover. And they will not distort with a high pass."
diyaudio,30apni,guywithjazzhands,4,Wed Mar 25 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"What's important to you?  Ease of transport? Compact size? Maximum output? Bass reproduction? Efficiency? Durability?  In general the trade-offs are small size, efficiency and bass reproduction. Pick two.  $200 isn't going to get you much, it depends on what stuff you have lying around. A car battery will last a long time, but you are limited to 12V. They aren't cheap, do you already have one that you can use? A car amplifier will work just fine, but they aren't necessarily cheap unless you already have one. Car speakers are not a great choice (at least on the low end), but the 4 ohm impedance will work well with an amp that runs off of 12V. The box depends greatly on the speakers you use.  At that budget I might just get some cheap speakers from a thrift shop and whatever battery powered amp I could come up with."

diyaudio,30apni,xole,2,Wed Mar 25 23:19:27 2015 UTC,"You could pick up some used car stereo speakers and build an enclosure for them.  They'll also probably be able to deal with the elements a bit better.   If you can find a decent pair of 6x9 or 6"" coaxials cheap, it'd work ok.  Try to get something that's not a paper cone since you'll be using them outside.    Back in the 90s I built a set of enclosures for what at the time was Pyle's top of the line 6x9 speakers.  They actually sounded pretty good, and with a rubberized spray on coating on the outside enclosure (do that before mounting the speakers of course), they were fairly water resistant.  For a battery, any 12 v battery will work, assuming you use a car amp.  A marine deep cycle battery would be better since they deal with being drained all the way down and then recharged.  Car batteries are designed to provide lots of current for a short period of time, whereas deep cycle batteries are made to provide less peak power, but for a much longer time.  Also, you're not going to get deep bass without a subwoofer."

First off, please join us at Festivalanlæg.dk, where all Danish speaker builders reside. I'm on there as well, look for KHesse!  So, the ""halfinator"" is half of a ""boominator"", the best festival speakers you'll ever find. Over at diyaudio there is the 500 page post for the Boominator that was developed by Saturnus, another Dane, back in 2007. The halfinator is basically half a boominator compartment, that still plays plenty loud.  The ""Boominator Mini"" has the same setup as the Boominator, but with smaller units. You can see more of that here.  My recommendation would be to buy a mini. Over at accusafe you can buy a full set of all the units you will need for the Mini.

Sourcing parts in Denmark is expensive and parts from outside the EU will be taxed at 25% + a 180 kr. fee if the order value is 80+ kr. (or is it 180? Can't remember right now). That being said, if you can in any way afford it you will not regret building the mini (€140+ for parts from accusafe + wood + switches, voltmeters, etc. from ebay/dealextreme). Alternatively you can look up the parts for a halfinator from the danish wepshop canopysound.dk, they're the guys running festivalanlaeg.dk Saturnus is very well respected when it comes to portable builds and he has thought of everything in these designs.

I did briefly consider trying to make it removable.. for longevity, security and convenience, but as I'm driving it cross country in a few weeks, that may be a plan down the road.  Another consideration I had in choosing the parts was to be able to reuse stuff afterwards if I went a different direction.  So, if the tablet dies, I can still use the DAC and OTG cable on some other project, I'd still need the Data Bus for another headunit, and the  amp and Speakers would work with any system, so I'm basically only out the $8 step-down regulator and the tablet which is collecting dust anyway.

It accepts the signals and then sends it where they need to go.  For example you transmit 5.1 via HDMI.

If I connect the headphones output to the line-input on the Crate, it connects normally to a preamp from the Crates headphone output.    I really like the distortion of the Peavey, I'm sure I could get my hands on a used one for $50. Assuming it wouldn't have the same error. I do have a lot of ampsims, and as far as hardware goes, I have a Digitech Bad Monkey, Damage Control Solid Metal, the Crate GX-15. Also a Boss DS-1 (which I'm gonna sell).  Is there nothing I can do? I could open the Peavey up and post pictures of the inside. This seems to be the schematic.  Besides the reason that I like the sound, I can't really afford anything fancier at the moment, and though there are amps in the $100 - 200$; with the Peavey, I know what I have. ;/ The Peavey's been that way for as long as I can remember.  I also built a cab with a  Celestion G12 K-100 8 Ohm    I made it so I have an in and out on my Warwick Blue Cab 60.1 and use the amp on that to drive the speaker. I guess I could use the wires of the Peavey (now top) and make a connector so I can use it with the cab, but I guess I'd fry the Peavey if I push it too hard.."
diyaudio,304m1a,esquilax,2,Tue Mar 24 17:02:31 2015 UTC,"I mean the thing I worry about is that the ground in the amp is messed up. So you might be able to clear up the DC at the headphone output with a couple of blocking caps or something, but then it turns out that if you touch the faceplate and your strings at the same time, you're going to get hit with a big voltage. I can't really tell you from here if that's the problem, and I wouldn't be the guy to do it in person, either. I've just heard of things going wrong that way."
diyaudio,304m1a,Barge108,2,Tue Mar 24 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I do know a bit about electricity. If you can feel a light buzzing it's probably AC, not DC. You can get a DC burn if there's enough amps, but that's more like the kind of power that's outputted by a spot welder, not a guitar amp. The fridge at my parents' house when I was growing up would give you a sort of buzzing feeling when you touched the handle with one hand, and grounded yourself with another hand to the metal trim around the counter. This sounds like what you're experiencing. I put a multimeter on it once and it only read something like 5vAC but still very noticeable when you would lightly draw your fingers across it. I'd just check the AC side of the amp and make sure there aren't any loose connections, and that the circuits are grounded properly to the case or at least to a common ground within the case."

diyaudio,304m1a,batstrat,2,Wed Mar 25 08:37:59 2015 UTC,"I am no expert. So take everything I say as bad advice. Don't mess with any electronic gear unless you are well educated in electrical safety and know how to discharge the voltage from the capacitors in a safe way. At the very least, leave it unplugged for a week before you open it and stay away from the power caps...  Light buzz when you touch the strings? You need a new decoupling cap on the input (C6). You'll also have to check the mains for any loose connections and crap on the board. Does it also hum? Your electrolytic caps could be dying.  According to J2 on that schematic, you have a ""Pre out"" just plug that into the power amp that you wish use, and then plug that into your speakers.  You can also plug the pre-out into your mixing board, just make sure you start with your trim on low and have your pad on. Then use a cab-sim on that signal, or re-amp it later.  Believe me, you're much better off using the preamp out, rather than the headphone out.   If all you need to do is step down the gain coming from your headphone/preamp out, I suggest you put a DI box between your source and your mixer and put the pads on. Any other ham-fisted series of resistors and caps will just ruin your sound.  Lastly, a DI box won't allow DC to pass because they're transformer coupled. So you could use it on the input or preamp out, and be relatively safe."

I don't think the amp hums, no. Thanks for going through the schematic, seems I have an old one that doesn't have a Pre Out, as you can see from the pictures. :/  I think I could replace caps, if I know what to use as replacement, and which ones to switch out. If I cut the caps an leave a bit of the old ""legs"" to solder new ones on.  Thomann has a cheap DI box, I could get a couple of those. I'm an idiot, but: Amp HP Output> DI Box Input> Preamp/mixer> PC.  And if I'd use one for the Amp Input (though I have a Daccapo Reampbox), then I'd use the DI box in reverse?: PC> DI Output> Amp input?  With the Crate, that works fine, I go: PC> Reampbox> Crate input> Headphones output> DI/preamp/mixer> PC."

Couple of tips for anyone else assembling this, or other ABS pipe stands:    Use Nylock nuts, or at the very least a lock washer to the threaded rod ends.  If you're feeling extra saucy, add a second nut as a jam nut   This'll help prevent things from loosening up over time and getting wobbly, or leaking sand. When filling the void, do so slowly, and tap the sides of the pipe gently with a rubber mallet.  This'll help it pack and settle as much as possible during the initial fill. After a few weeks of use, double check your nuts, and have a peek in the sand hole and top up as necessary.  More settling can happen, depending on the type of sand you use."

diyaudio,3014cg,meezun,2,Mon Mar 23 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, I assume that you want your batteries to last more than 5 minutes. That means that you need highly efficient speakers that can run off of a low power amplifier. Assume that you can't afford more than about 10 watts of amplification. The tripath ta2020 based amplifiers are a good choice for battery power (note: the specs on these amps lie, they are good for about 6-8 watts per channel into 8 ohms). Charging off of solar is going to limit you as well unless you have a honking big solar panel.  Second, I assume that you want to be able to lift the thing. That means that your speakers need to be small and light weight, so forget about bass. And don't use 3/4"" MDF (or even 1/2"" MDF).  And obviously you are going to be compromised on stereo separation.  I'd look for boombox projects that other people have done. When you are starting out you it's best to go with a project designed by someone more experienced and just follow their lead. A boombox makes a lot of trade-offs for it's portability and it's not easy to know how to do that without a lot of knowledge."

diyaudio,3014cg,ilikemonkeys,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:04:12 2015 UTC,"The biggest challenge I had when building my first box was the battery/charging logistics. I thusly skipped that feature and built it as a plug in only model. It helped me get a good idea of a basic boombox and helped me go foward from there.   I used the 15x2 Sure amp board from Parts Express (Ta2024) and 2x GRS 3"" speakers (rated at 10w RMS, but they rarely reach that). If you tune the box right you can get plenty of bass, and at comfortably loud enough to have to make an effort to talk over it draws 7-8 watts total (1.5 watts under typically listening volume). This is within battery-powered levels. ~$56 for 10x 3.6v li-ion @ 2100mah, then with two parallel sets of 5x batteries give 18v (they will drop voltage slightly as they discharge, but still remain within recommended voltage range for the amp board). You will still need to arrange for a small charging control board ($10-15). At 18v and 4100 mah, thats about ~70 Watt hours. That should give ~9-10 hours at loud volumes and ~50 at lower comfortable levels.  Someone correct my math if I'm wrong  Another tip would be to select a set of drivers with a higher sensitivity, this mean they'll draw less power for more sound. Stay above 81 dB 1W/1m at least.  Also, clever use of a high-pass filter should extend battery life even farther. I found the speaker I used are rated at 135 hz- 16khz. The lower the frequency the more power it consumes. However, when tested my speakers struggle at 135-150hz, yet still guzzle power. Using a high pass filter to remove frequencies under 150hz should improve my sound and my power usage.

I couldn't figure out why my circuit wasn't working when I built a similar circuit, and it is just because the circuit isn't really designed to account for the wide variance in JFETS. This is why they are mostly being phased out in favor of MOSFET's in industry, but the audio world still loves to fetishize certain ""magical"" components, such as the JFET.   It would be much better to use a simple Op Amp based circuit. They are more reliable, easier to build and troubleshoot, and easier to understand.  With that being said, to actually answer your questions: The resistors will not affect anything noteworthy in your buffer, and yes the grounds are all connected -- ""ground"" is a term to define a common return path for current and a reference for measuring voltages in the circuit.

diyaudio,2zwmms,ss0889,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"That one, I'm less certain of, mostly because I haven't spent any time with that particular crossover. The combination of RS28 and RS180 is a good one, though. Solid bass, and for less than party levels, it won't need a subwoofer. I'm running those woofers in my main system right now.   What I can tell you is that those cabinets are hella nice. You'll never DIY a more professional enclosure."
diyaudio,2zwmms,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:43:29 2015 UTC,"what would you think of building those but then using a miniDSP as an active crossover in biamp config? I think all that would be needed there is to take a near field measurement of the woofer and of the tweeter (or fuck, just go off of datasheets) and then set the miniDSP to control the preamp volume, then go input to my amp from there and output from my amp to the drivers. MAYBE have a simple 1st order crossover (which, correct me if i'm wrong, would be just an inductor or just a capacitor)?"
diyaudio,2zwmms,ss0889,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"A miniDSP would work. And because of the nature of the RS180, you'd need all of its capabilities. If you look at the datasheet, you'll see some serious breakup in the top octaves of the woofer's response. These are actually harmonics, caused by resonances an octave or two below the actual visible peaks. In order to keep these out of your final audible signature, the RS180 needs to be crossed no higher than 2khz, and preferably with 48dB/oct. slopes. A number of very good crossover designers took a stab at creating a good two-way using the RS180 and RS28. The better ones implemented a crazy-ass topology known as a ""Cauer-Elliptical filter"" which approximates an 8th order roll-off. In those, there's no harshness or listening fatigue at all.   While I've designed a number of speakers now, I'm currently enjoying Jon Marsh's Modula MT (RS180 + Seas 27TBFC/G) and I don't think I'd want to tackle the woofer in one of my own designs using passive components. I just happen to build these because I already had the tweeters, cabinets, and about half the crossover components. They're keeping me quite happy while I retrofit & upgrade my towers.   As an aside, despite its seemingly ragged response in the top octave, the RS28 is one of the finest tweeters that one can purchase at any price. I like it much better than the Seas unit that it competes against in price. The RS28's distortion is impressively low, and it can take a surprising amount of abuse--like a 1.8khz crossover to the RS180. I'm pretty sensitive to treble, and I've never heard an implementation of the RS28 that was at all lacking.   Anyway, I'm rambling. If you decide to go active, there's no need to put a coil on the woofer, since high frequencies won't damage it--they'll just sound like ass. However, tweeters really don't get on well with bass signals, so a series cap is never a bad idea, simply as ""oh shit"" protection. ;-)"
diyaudio,2zwmms,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"would i just go output of dac or w/e into minidsp, and then minidsp to preamp input on my amp and then amp output connected directly to the woofer/tweeter terminals? (and the tweeter would have a cap placed on it, just for sanity)"
diyaudio,2zwmms,ss0889,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:59:22 2015 UTC,You'd need two amps.   DAC-> preamp-> miniDSP-> four channels amplification. Don't worry about the extra ADC-to-DAC that the miniDSP causes. It's got plenty of headroom and more than enough sample rate.
diyaudio,2zwmms,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:06:07 2015 UTC,"ah, forgot to mention, i can use my receiver's zone 2 as a biamp output. it has no filtering though, so whatever you put in is what you'll get out. figured i'd go pre-out (or fuck, even high power out) from receiver to minidsp, and that goes to the speaker. either that or use a seperate set of amps."
diyaudio,2zwmms,ss0889,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"As long as you can control the gain of each channel pair simultaneously, that sounds like it should work. You may have to fiddle with phase. Home theater receivers get funny notions about speaker delay, given they're built to make assumptions about correlating 5 or more channels. The zone 2 will also rely on the amplifiers for the surround backs, which may not have as nice of a DAC, so put the woofers on zone 2 if there's any doubt. Most receivers are now 192khz across all channels, but with a slightly older gear, you never know.   That said, I've been kicking around a very similar idea as you. I've got a beefy Yamaha with 6.1 analog ins that would make a great stand-in until I can purchase enough separate amplification to take my 3-way towers active. They're getting new mids that will necessitate a completely new crossover, so I suppose now is the time..."

diyaudio,2zq3rl,truls-rohk,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"well the nice thing about them being active is the impedance of the drivers won't affect the crossover point. you will probably have to do some experimentation.  it is also possible that the design takes into account differing sensitivities.

The tricky part will be finding a good 5"" driver, i would probably look for a 4ohm as they do tend to be less effecient then the tweeter and you'll coax some more power out of the amp that way.

diyaudio,2zigfk,andrewcooke,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. That is a good point about keeping the volume at a constant level. I am someone who is always playing with the settings until I find the perfect level for everything so having to reset the volume every time I use the amplifier would probably drive me insane.   Also, I realize that I am making a passive pre-amp for a stock power amp board. The sub out is a feature I am interested and as /u/ThickAsABrickJT mentioned there are some considerations with that."
diyaudio,2zigfk,ThickAsABrickJT,4,Thu Mar 19 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"Overall, the design is fairly solid, but there are a few minor issues that are probably worth being aware of.  When it comes to power, you would probably either need a dedicated switch or a relay.  Check your pot-switch's current rating.  Before considering the use of a buck regulator, take note that there are an enormous variety of relays on the market and you'll probably be able to find one that works on 19V.  Mouser has a good variety IIRC.  (By the way, make sure your DC GND is connected--I don't see it on your schematic but I assume you meant to put it there.)  Your subwoofer outputs have a worst-case impedance of 5 kΩ.  This is somewhat high.  Although you probably won't have issues due to this, some subwoofers have low-impedance inputs also on the order of 5 kΩ, which means that you might experience some minor oddities with how the volume control works.  This is a very minor issue that you probably wouldn't even notice, but if you do, it is fixed by putting an op-amp between your volume control and your sub outs.  (Also, if you use an op-amp, you can build some circuitry to mix the sub outs together into one connection.)  The final nit-pick is that your subwoofer connection lacks a crossover.  A crossover ensures that low frequencies get sent only to your subwoofer and high frequencies only to your main speakers to prevent the speakers from trying to work outside their range and interfering.  This makes it much easier to dial in the settings of your sub, but it's not necessary to do this--there are many fine systems built without crossovers, they just take more tweaking to get adjusted right.  Considering crossovers are a pain in the butt to design if you're not familiar with them, adding a crossover is most likely not worth the trouble.  By the way, as an EE, your schematic isn't bad at all.  It's unambiguous, uses well-known symbols, and gets your idea across effectively."
diyaudio,2zigfk,meezun,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:24:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your input. After considering what /u/andrewcooke said, I think I will stick to a dedicated power switch.   I knew that just splitting the sub out off of the feed into the amp was not the best way to do it, but I didn't know the right way. I know next to nothing about op amps. Which one should I use and how should it be implemented?  As for the crossover on the sub output. Most subs that I have seen (including the ones I have) all have variable crossovers built into them. I don't want to pin myself to a set crossover point because I know I will make changes to this system in the future that will probably require a different crossover point. Also, I agree, crossovers are a pain to design.  Finally, yes, DC ground will be connected."
diyaudio,2zigfk,meezun,2,Thu Mar 19 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"It's not the lowpass on the input of the sub that is the issue, it is the lack of a highpass on your mains amp.  Your main speakers will still be trying to reproduce the low frequencies that your sub is supposed to be handling. Not only does that lead to overlap between the frequencies that the mains and the subs are reproducing, but also puts an unnecessary load on your mains trying to reproduce frequencies they cannot handle.  Take a look at the [miniDSP](www.minidsp.com). This is a low-cost digital crossover that is really easy to set up. It can handle volume control as well and has many equalization options. One of these would make for a much better sounding solution than what you are contemplating."
diyaudio,2zigfk,andrewcooke,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:03:17 2015 UTC,"This is also much more expensive, but an interesting option. I haven't heard about digital crossovers before but I like the idea because I can constantly tweak it to my hearts content and then start all over when I swap out components in my system.   To confirm, this would replace the volume section on my amp and the two outputs would go to the sub and amp providing both with a signal at an acceptable impedance."
diyaudio,2zigfk,ThickAsABrickJT,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, although to use the volume control option you need to get the pcb version of the miniDSP and not the version with an enclosure.  You can also get the miniDIGI add-on board for multiple switchable digital inputs."
diyaudio,2zigfk,ThickAsABrickJT,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"you're probably better asking the engineer, but what you want is a simple (unity gain) buffer circuit.  https://www.google.com/search?q=buffer+opamp+circuit&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8  you need to worry about inversion - either use a non-inverting buffer or swap the ""plus"" and ""minus"" for the signal."
diyaudio,2zigfk,lutkeveld,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"A crossover isn't absolutely necessary, but the most basic way is to build a highpass filter for your main amp and let the sub do the lowpass part.  The issue is that, with a single-sided supply, the op-amp circuitry involved to keep the volume control (and sub's input impedance) from interfering with the highpass filter still gets pretty ugly.  This is a mockup for just the right channel.  So if you feel comfortable doing that, go ahead.  But really, you might just find it alright to do without the crossover, and the sub's effect on the volume control will probably be subtle--you'll most likely only notice it as an increase in volume when turning off the sub.  (Which, come to think of it, might be a good thing because it could compensate for the sub being off!)  EDIT: stray fragments, minor mistakes.   Also, the high-pass filter would be adjustable to match whatever sub you use."
diyaudio,2zigfk,ThickAsABrickJT,1 point,Fri Mar 20 06:06:20 2015 UTC,"Your diagram of the right channel has me convinced. That is not something that I want to do.   I am not totally familiar with how the subwoofer output will effect the volume control other than knowing that it isn't good practice to implement without something like an op amp. I know that it is not something that would be tolerated in a professional design, but I think I am okay with it in this to keep the cost and complication low. As I understand it from what you are saying is that the sub out will mess with the resistance of the volume control when connected. The taper should remain the same, or tolerably similar though. Is this correct? That I can live with.  The miniDSP is a cool an interesting option, but I think I am going to Keep It Simple Stupid for my design."
diyaudio,2zigfk,theblackspanner,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"Well, the effective taper is what would change--consider that the sub's input, in the worst-case scenario of 5kΩ impedance, would act like the extra resistor in this circuit.   But the effect wouldn't be as severe as in that circuit; just that the volume control will seem a little ""different.""  So yeah, ""tolerably different"" would be a good way to put it.  Plus, this is a worst-case scenario--most subs will have an input impedance on the order of 10kΩ, whose effect probably won't even be noticeable.  Heck, most audio taper pots have worse aberrations than what would be caused by a 10kΩ load.    That said, if you still want to do the highpass filter, you'll need to use the final stage of that circuit I drew.  (C6 and rightwards).  C6, R6, and RV2 would need to be changed so as not to be affected by the volume control's changing impedance.  I suggest you wire up your original design and see how you like it.  It's simple enough that, if you find that you need the highpass filter, you can easily add that at a later time.  EDIT:  Also, you'd be surprised what is tolerated in a professional design.  If it isn't going to affect the user experience and it won't cause any reliability/safety issues, why bother overcomplicating things?"
diyaudio,2zigfk,theblackspanner,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:07:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for your input. I think you are right. I will just wire this up and see what happens. I will probably skip the high pass and just add an external passive 2nd order high pass after the power stage because it will be more simple to implement and tweak with my experience/knowledge. I know this adds an unnecessary load on the amp, but the amp has enough power to take it."
diyaudio,2zhy5b,pmalla,9,Wed Mar 18 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Spiked feet do not isolate anything.  If they have any effect, it's a more direct coupling of the speaker to the subfloor (and structure of the house) by piercing through the carpet.  In an ideal setup, the speaker box would have no resonances on any surface.  The ONLY thing you want to move/vibrate is the speaker cone (and in some cases, the air from the port if there is one).  Anything else leaking air or moving/vibrating/resonating is noise not produced by the speaker coil, and does nothing but change the sound in a way not in line with the speaker itself.  Sometimes these are called 'colorations' of the sound.    I'm of the school of thought that the sound should come from the speaker driver itself, anything else is just noise.  Good question, though."
diyaudio,2zhy5b,popsicle_of_meat,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:05:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for that explanation. Is this why some choose to use cinder blocks as bases?
diyaudio,2zhy5b,popsicle_of_meat,2,Wed Mar 18 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"I think the reason for cinder blocks is because they are cheap and heavy.  Cheap is always good, and they're heavy so they're less likely to be knocked over."
diyaudio,2zhy5b,why-not-zoidberg,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"Also heavy means harder to vibrate, which is good if you can couple the speaker cabinets to the cinder blocks. Certainly better than lightweight stands which might vibrate with the cabinet.  Edit: holy old thread batman. whoops."
diyaudio,2zhy5b,will592,3,Thu Mar 26 05:11:16 2015 UTC,I use them and recommend them if for no other reason that giving the speaker/whatever a stable base. If you sit the speaker with a large flat bottom on carpet it's likely going to be able to rock back and forth a bit. Imagine it like sitting a speaker on a plate of BBs; it's probably flat-ish but it's not a great interface. If you have carpet spikes you can create a stable platform with three or four points that will keep the speaker in place. This has the added benefit of keeping people from sliding it back against the wall when they vacuum because they don't like it being in the middle of the room.
diyaudio,2zhy5b,supergrover2_0,5,Thu Mar 19 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"I put some spikes on my floorstanding speakers that were previously just sitting on carpet. I noticed a slight improvement in sound quality, but it didn't wow me. They sounded a little clearer and the imaging sounded a little better. That was only with critical listening. My girlfriend just shrugged. It very well could have just been placebo effect.   I think of it as every action has an equal and opposite reaction. As the cone of the driver is moving back and forth it is moving the cabinet back and forth ever so slightly if the cabinet isn't securely anchored to the floor. With the spikes, the cabinet has better resistance to this movement and so the sound is more accurate. This is just the nonsense that I came up with in my head, but it makes sense to me. YMMV"
diyaudio,2zhy5b,McLurkin,2,Wed Mar 18 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"I think there is a bit of truth to what you are thinking.  If a speaker enclosure had infinite mass, then when driving the speaker cone there would be no energy wasted on moving the enclosure opposite of the cone (think laws of conservation) .  By using spikes with carpet, the speaker kinda digs itself in and is less likely to move back and forth, wasting the energy that the cone is trying to emit as pressure waves.  Spikes on hard surfaces however... that just seems like it might make tiny scratches."

diyaudio,2zdv52,B_Rich,1 point,Wed Mar 18 08:49:45 2015 UTC,I don't know the physics behind it but it plays a big factor in the quality of the amp. Lower quality amps (usually) won't be able to bridge 2 channels.

diyaudio,2zafiw,tribbin,6,Tue Mar 17 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"A port is more than just a hole in a box. It's a carefully picked helmholtz resonator. It gives a boost just below where the response of the speaker would normally drop of to increase the bass extension. At low frequencies the wavelengths are very big, so the placement on the box doesn't really matter because it radiates in full space anyway.

diyaudio,2zafiw,Iglum,2,Tue Mar 17 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"SLA batteries, the type we used, are designed to be cycled. Of course LiFePO4 is superior in every way, especially their cycle life, but they cost much more. Our battery was €20, while a comparable size LiFe would cost ~€100, not even counting the more expensive charger and protection circuits. I'll be using LiFePO4 from A123 or Headway in the future for projects where weight and size matters more than cost/capacity."

While building from a kit can teach you some valuable soldering skills (they are arguably far nicer to solder, what with their pre-tinned, correctly sized and spaced component tabs/holes/pads) you will learn very little about the circuit you are building.  DIY electronics is a valuable skill if you are into cost effective audio hardware, or if you want to have something a bit different (or a lot different!). Sure you wont learn everything in one build but it is the first step and a very good one too.  You may choose to build an A47 (http://benfeist.com/how-to-build-the-apheared-47-headphone-amplifier-for-grado-headphones/) next to get a bit more current or pick one of Rod Elliott's fantastic projects (http://sound.westhost.com/projects.htm). If these 'next steps' sound appealing to you a true DIY CMoy as your first project will make these next projects far more approachable.  As for cost, it may well come out the same but you may be able to get better components for the money.  Quality, dependable components in audio does not have to mean esoteric brands and technologies. A great budget resistor is the Multicomp MF25 which is Farnell/Newark's brand. I use Holco H8 series resistors for something a bit more special. For capacitors in the power supply you don't have to go crazy to get fantastic quality. Panasonic FM or AM series are great and space efficient (2.5 mm pitch, 220-330 uF, 10 V, about 11 mm tall). I exclusively use WIMA film caps for (de)coupling but I sell a product and people do like to buy WIMA. Vishay and Panasonic do some excellent film (1 uF for input caps, 10-68 nF for the opamps power pins if you go that far).  I can send you all of this for cost of the postage if you would like?

diyaudio,2z61x8,TomAskew,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:00:28 2015 UTC,Prefect. I'll start ordering stuff sometime next week. I read on the A47 website that you should test cheap headphones on the amount before the expensive ones. What do I do if I don't have another pair? I do however have a multimeter and access to an oscilloscope. What should I look for on these?
diyaudio,2z61x8,geofft,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"I think testing with cheap headphones is fine if you don't have a multimeter or o'scope but these tools should allow you to test to a high level of certainly that your amp is OK without having to risk any headphones or more importantly your ears.  After building your amplifier but before you plug a source or headphones in:  Check your bipolar power supply for a balanced Voltage distribution (if you are using a 9 V power source, you should have a +4.5 V and a -4.5 V on your circuit both at the decoupling electrolytic capacitors and at the opamp socket(s). If you build with an opamp socket (I would!) then run this Voltage test before inserting the opamp.  If this tests out OK then plug in the opamp and test these Voltages again.  See if there's a Voltage offset on the output - people say about 10 mV is acceptable. I usually expect a maximum of +/-3 mV but that's just me.  If you have got this far OK then get the o'scope out and test each channel output for any oscillation. This will be with nothing on the input.  If you want you can apply some signals to the input (I just run sine/squares through mine at 1 kHz for initial tests) - look for any distortion and on the square look for any ringing or waveform distortion. Dual channel is nice at this stage!  You can then do this waveform test again with headphones plugged in to load the circuit with a dynamic, real world load. You can expect an output Voltage reduction when loaded - this is normal.  At this point you know that everything is connected OK and there's no oscillation. You are as ready as you ever will be to plug your headphones in.  I use crappy Apple buds. Switch on your source/amp and plug it all in. Bring the volume up until you can hear the buds on your desk then bring them up to your ears and don't seat them in your ears until you are 100% that it's not going to spike on the output.  This list is overkill and I've probably missed some steps (anyone else want to add?) but it's a logical approach that will help you identify most of the 'usual' failure points like a misbehaving opamp or poor power supply."

diyaudio,2z5gsh,o0jrock0o,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:31:53 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. I actually didn't know there was that little of a volume difference from that wattage difference. I'll just go ahead with better drivers then.
diyaudio,2z1w7y,schmidty850,3,Sat Mar 14 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"First off, I agree with /u/substrate80 and think the 4"" should be sealed.   But.. you dont even need the 4"". Midrange drivers get involved when the woofer is too big to make it all the way up to the tweeter crossover point. Like when you've got a 12"" woofer. A 6.5"" should make it just fine. The 4"" is simply not needed.   All it will do for you is complicate the build. You're just in the process of building the cabinet and the 4"" is already causing you problems. Wait until it's time to design the crossover! A 3-way crossover is about four times harder to build than a 2-way. I don't mean to sound preachy, but its something to keep in mind.    What drivers do you have picked?"

Do you just suggest a 6.5"" and maybe like a 2"" tweeter instead?  Or should I do as /u/substrate80 suggested and drop the 6.5"", use the 4""ers and the tweeter for my two speakers, and make a separate small sub out of the 6.5""?"

Basically the woofer would play up to 350 Hz, the 4"" mid would play from 350 to 3000 Hz, and the tweeter would play 3000 Hs and up.  The only problem is that the crossover gets hard to design."
diyaudio,2z1w7y,substrate80,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have any of these speakers yet, I was going to buy them. I have tried building a crossover but when I was following the 3-way tutorial on a site I ran into the problem of not knowing what my crossover frequencies would be, I don't really know how you go about finding that.  Asking your honest opinion, do you think I should use all three speakers? Or just go with the tweeter/4"" or the tweeter/6.5""? I'm new to all this and don't really know what would be best.  My ideal design for this is going to be media center/music oriented such that I will have these hooked up to my tv(for movies/tv) and also be able to play music off of them. They are not going to be my primary computer speakers, really only for above mentioned applications"
diyaudio,2z1w7y,substrate80,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"OK, sorry I thought you already had the drivers.  Well, what I would do, since this is your first set, is just build a 2-way (midwoofer + tweeter).    You're not going to get much bass out of a 4"" driver so I recommend you go with a 6.5"" driver.    For the crossover frequency, you'll want to use around 3.0 kHz.  You mentioned that you were using a tutorial site to design crossovers.  I'm assuming they have one for a 2-way speaker.  Use a 2nd order or higher Butterworth filter.  You'll also want to incorporate a Zobel into your crossover to compensate for the inductance (rising impedance) of the tweeter.  http://diyaudioprojects.com/Technical/Speaker-Zobel/  If you want to go for the 3-way, I think it's a good idea, but like I said the crossover is more difficult to design.  Let me explain why.  When you design a crossover, you design it for a particular load impedance.  Most speakers are 8-ohm .. some are 4 ohms and some are 16.  When you design your crossover for your speaker, you need to make sure you design it for the proper impedance.  You might even have two 8 ohm speakers in parallel to make for a final 4 ohm load, and if you design a crossover for this speaker combination it would need to be designed for 4 ohms instead of 8 ohms.  If the load impedance is not correct for the crossover, the crossover point will shift up or down in frequency.  Now, when you design a crossover for a 3-way speaker, the midrange speaker needs to have a band-pass filter, which is essentially a high-pass filter in series with a low-pass filter.  What happens is the low-pass filter changes the load impedance seen by the high-pass filter and screws with the amplitude response of the filter.  Instead of the pass-band being nice and flat, it ends up spiking on one end.  If you're clever you can account for this.  If the crossover points are far apart then they don't really affect each-other so you don't have to worry about this issue.    Okay, that was a nice wall of text.  Anyway, for the mid-range I actually recommend you go with a 2"" dome, that way you don't have to build a separate enclosure.  I really like the Morel EM 1308  http://www.parts-express.com/morel-em-1308-2-1-8-dome-midrange--287-030  This is a sealed-back unit, therefore it does not need a separate cavity within the speaker box.  If you use a 4"" cone midrange, you will need to build a separate cavity for it so that the back-waves from the 6.5"" diver don't hit and distort the 4"" driver."

Home theater? Hifi? PA? Something else?  For example, I XO the DE250 at about 800hz in my home system, but that's really pushing it if you need extreme output e.g. if you were outside.(not to mention that you need a horn that loads that low). Earl Geddes uses the 250 in conjunction with the B&C TBX 15, which, iirc, can play a little higher than the BG driver.   Will you have subs? If not, is the cabinet you already own going to get you low enough output? If it's ported relatively high (>40hz), then you might want to consider a woofer that'll get you above 2khz and separate subs ---- or not.  I can elaborate further if you can give me some more info."
diyaudio,2yxkjh,awgoody,2,Fri Mar 13 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"These are floor monitor cabinets at a music venue rigged as a true bi-amped with outboard XO. Currently XO'd at 1.4k. The cabinets were made by a now de-funct Colorado company called Madison Speakers. They were sold to me and installed by another local company that modified the speakers into their current bi-amped state.  I want these speakers to get to 115-120db and rip someones head off. It'd also be nice if the drummer could hear and feel his kick drum more. In their current state, they are not very impressive in that regard. I've considered adding a single 18"" cabinet to create a drum fill and set the current 15"" cabinet on top of it when drummers require more thump.   My biggest question is whether these amps are big enough to power the 2K watt 8 ohm B&C speaker? Shouldn't you get amps that are even more powerful then the rating? Each amp is on its own 20amp breaker too so I know it's getting a lot of juice.   Here is the CA4 and CA6 Owners Manual: http://www.peaveycommercialaudio.com/media/pdf/caman11-25-97.pdf  Here is the Venue Specs: http://www.moxitheater.com/venue-info/ *Soon to be adding a Soundcraft digital Si3 this month!  I've done my best to ring the monitors out before shows on my 31 band EQ at FOH and replaced drivers when they burn out but if I'm being honest they aren't very consistent sounding. They currently have mis-matched Emminence 15"" woofers and Emminence 1"" horn drivers in them so I'm sure anything I do will be an upgrade from my current situation.  Unfortunately I can't find any specs for the monitors. Here's a picture I found though! (kinda) http://www.moxitheater.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSC_0060.jpg - I'll get more pictures ASAP."
diyaudio,2yxkjh,awgoody,2,Sat Mar 14 05:24:35 2015 UTC,"I will admit that my builds are more for home than true PA, but your proposal doesn't make much sense to me.  First, I'm kind of surprised that the old one used a 1"" CD down to 1.4khz with such high output. Use a relatively steep XO and you'll be alright though. Also make sure you have some kind of protection circuit on there.  Second, the woofer you looked at isn't going to work here without a bigger compression driver. The BG really struggles above 1khz. I should admit that my further research on the B&C website was quick, but they have much better options; See the PZB100, PS100, & the NW76. You lose the low Fs, but you won't need it anyway.   My biggest question is whether these amps are big enough to power the 2K watt 8 ohm B&C speaker?   Do you know how to calculate output? For every 3dB increase in driver sensitivity you double the wattage needed - As far as this getting by, the math says it does, but I'd defer to someone with more expertise in this field.   It'd also be nice if the drummer could hear and feel his kick drum more   Part of that will depend on the size of the cabinet. It's probably ported, right? If it's ported higher than the kick drum (50-60hz, iirc), then it won't help.   I've considered adding a single 18"" cabinet to create a drum fill.    That would definitely do it."

Depending on the layout of your room, front and center may not be the best place to put your sub.    As far as whether or not it would affect your DLP TV, it would depend on how well isolated the top of the stand is from the subwoofers' vibration.

When you wire that ODAC output to P1 of the O2 you will want to twist the left and right channel each with a ground wire. I think JDS just wanted to avoid confusion since NwAvGuy only put 3 holes for P1. You should solder both grounds to the O2.   The wires you are soldering onto the ODAC are electrically connected directly to that 3.5mm jack on the ODAC. So yes he must be connecting those RCA jacks to those signals. The RCA's on the back would be electrically wired directly to the 3.5mm ""input"" jack on the O2.   Basically, if the ODAC is unpowered you can use those jacks as inputs to the O2. Also vice versa.

P2 is electrically connected directly to the output jack of the O2. It's for panel mounting the output jack on a bigger case for example.   Yes I would redo that run. By separately twisting each channel with a ground wire you reduce crosstalk and make them less susceptible to noise (both very important).

diyaudio,2yuf2g,mr_pablo,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"Want quality? Your amp probably accepts a volt or two above/below 12v. Probably no need for a regulator as long as it's close. You could build a nice power supply with a 9v toroidal transformer, a full-wave DC rectifier bridge, and some capacitors. This would provide a little over 12VDC, as much amperage as you need depending on the VA rating of the transformer and size of the capacitors.  Or you can just buy one like this, which worked fine for me for Tripath amps... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VE7GQQ  (there are other cheaper prime eligible ones, not sure if they work as well)."

Voltages tend to also be of the higher nature, somewhere around 18 volts. Not the 12 volts you are after.  Also laptop power bricks tend to be grounded through the third pin on the AC. This can also introduce all sorts of issues.  I would buy a dedicated Meanwell power supply. They are not expensive.  Have a look at these"

I'm using a HP power supply for a TPA3116 amplifier at the moment.   Don't get a no-brand one though, at least get one from a known laptop manufacturer like HP, Dell, etc... In addition, make sure they don't have a center pin or some smart sensing otherwise they won't turn on because they know they're not connected to a laptop.   Those stand-alone power supplies should also be fine (assuming they're not 'too' cheap), however be careful not to zap yourself when connecting them up if they take screw terminal mains input - I guess you can just get the  laptop-style brick ones though. You can buy the DC female plugs instead of just cutting off the plugs, however from a safety perspective i'm not sure if the cheapies off ebay are actually rated for many amps of current through them."

diyaudio,2ytl4i,andrewcooke,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:45:10 2015 UTC,"I saw that site. I like their Headphone amp, but I Read that Amps that have lower output than the speaker is can harm them because they'll give out the peaks as continuous signals and damage the speakers."
diyaudio,2ytl4i,andrewcooke,2,Thu Mar 12 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"that's not exactly correct.  the rating on your speaker is the maximum it can handle without damage, and a lower power ampifier can work just fine with them.  BUT a low power amplifier won't go as loud - it just doesn't have the oomph. and, worse than that, if you turn it up too high, trying to make it loud, then it can distort.  that distorted signal is what damages your speaker (because it contains a lot of treble).  so what you were told is a kind of rough rule of thumb.  if you have an amp that has a higher power rating than your speakers then the most likely way you will damage your speakers is by simply turning it up so loud that you blow them up.  but that's pretty damn loud for most speakers, so relatively unlikely to happen.  whereas if you have an amp of a lower rating, then there is a temptation to turn it too high, and that can damage your speakers with distortion.  hence the rough guideline.  but you can hear when an amp is distorting.  so you are fine with a lower power amp as long as you don't turn it up so high you can hear it distort.  of course, the other problem is whether a lower power amp is loud enough without distorting.  15W is borderline - likely OK for listening by yourself, if you're not into loud music, but too low for parties."

Order the boards from here: http://sound.westhost.com/project101.htm  I found an old dead NAD 2-channel amp and salvaged the case, heatsink, power switch, and wiring terminals.

Most time consuming bit was making the case - probably better off buying or repurposing a case.

It's certainly something that can be done, but because you won't have access to volume component purchasing discounts and won't be making large run PCB orders the cost to quality ratio probably won't shift to be in your favor unless you're talking about cloning a vintage console. The disappointing  truth is that the cost of a DIY clone of a console worth as much as your house will still cost significantly more than the already available and very usable pro-sumer level mixers which for most of us can get the job we need done.     If you just want a project that can improve your front end quality maybe check out the kits at Seventh Circle Audio or similar. I've never built one but was given the opportunity to just sleep on the couches and live in The Bridge for a week while I recorded an album.

Frequency response: 50Hz~3KHzFs   50Hz isn't really a subwoofer, imo, on top of, I'd wager that the speaker probably starts being audible at 50Hz, not ""excels at producing"" 50Hz.   I'd be more inclined to use something like this GRS 12SW-4 12"", even though it's 4Ohms, and thus presumably for car audio, than the woofer you have linked to on Amazon.    Frequency response: 29 to 800 Hz   While probably not accurate, in my mind, a tighter range implies a higher probability of playing tones audibly at the fringe frequencies. Also, if you listen to any audio test on Youtube (20Hz -> 20Khz), the juciest range in my opinion is 35hz or below - seeing as how this is rated for 29Hz to 800Hz, I'd imagine 35Hz is probably playable just fine.

Also, any brand worth their salt should give you specs to work off of, if you're going to DIY. Parts-Express is my go to shop for stuff (I've bought 2 sets of speakers there, for later projects).   Have you watched any videos? What kind of build are you looking to do? You mentioned PA - I'm assuming like PA System? If that's the case, then maybe those woofers would work - PA ""Subwoofers"" imo are more like Woofers with a high Sensitivity (1W/M): 98 dB(±3dB) - they don't do the low rumbly frequencies you usually associate with a movie theater subwoofer, or car audio subwoofer.  Keep in mind, too, There's a lot of electrical stuff your'e going to want to pay attention to - 8 Ohm vs. 4 Ohm vs. 2 Ohm, wattage, and Sensitivity, like I mentioned before. (Note the GRS subwoofers I linked you have an 88db Sensitivity - and like I said, those are car audio and probably not suited to anything else, unless you wanted to... build an 8Ohm box with duals, I suppose.)"

I'm planning on whipping up a pair of speakers for my workshop and need help with a wiring diagram, please. I have a pair of crappy woofers (seen here) and a pair of full range 6x9s. Both are 4 ohm speakers. However, I want to drive them by my garage receiver at 8 ohms. I know I can just wire them up in series in each cabinet, but I want to include a simple passive two-way crossover, and that is where I'm getting confused. Can someone please post a wiring diagram that drives a pair of 4 ohm speakers at 8 ohms with a two way crossover included in the schematic? Thanks so much."
diyaudio,2yk031,InterloperKO,8,Tue Mar 10 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"Can someone please post a wiring diagram that drives a pair of 4 ohm speakers at 8 ohms with a two way crossover included in the schematic?   Sorry, no. It doesn't work out that way. When you involve a crossover, the amplifer ""sees"" the 4 ohm woofer at low frequencies and ""sees"" the 4 ohm 6x9 at high frequencies. Net result...still a 4 ohm speaker. You can't just add a series resistor, either. That has a lot of unforseen consequences--one of which is that your amplifier would be wasting half of its total output and working just as hard as if you hadn't bothered adding the resistor.   Here's what I'd do. I'd go buy a 25W or 70W plate amp and put the two woofers together in a box. Wire them up in series for an 8 ohm load. Or...just use one of the woofers and keep the 4 ohm load (which subwoofer plate amps happen to like).   This will allow you to run the woofers as straight up subs. You can then plop each 6x9 in its own smallish sealed box (.5 to .75 cubic feet sounds good) and run them full range from your garage receiver. Contrary to popular belief, you can almost always run 4 ohm speakers on a receiver that states 8-16ohms. Just be careful and don't go for max volume until you find out how hot the amplifier gets driving the 4 ohm 6x9 speakers."
diyaudio,2yhco8,ZummiGummi,4,Mon Mar 9 20:46:31 2015 UTC,Lovely build! FYI putting inductors so close to each other and on the same axis will cause all sorts of issues. They should be placed as far away from each other as possible and each on a different axis

diyaudio,2yhco8,prozackdk,2,Mon Mar 9 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"Hold the phone! You really shouldn't place the inductors one on top of the other like that. The inductive fields will overlap and the effective value will be altered for each and every one of them. In some cases, by 30-40%. Sometimes up, sometimes down. But the effects are significant enough to impact crossover slopes. It'll mostly effect where each of the pairs begins playing, but it'll also affect the tweeter's roll off."

diyaudio,2ydhsq,MentalWarfar3,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:45:25 2015 UTC,Rather than building new cabinets for them you could benefit from a PA subwoofer or a equalizer if you are willing to get additional gear.   What you can do for cheap is get acoustic foam for speakers and line the inside of the entire box. This should help eliminate some of the sound of the box itself.  If you want to make a pair of hi-fi speakers I would suggest buying a kit and building the box as PA speakers won't give you the fidelity you are looking for.

Unfortunately, it's hard to find; rockler, woodcraft, and most lumber yards don't carry it, you'll have to order online from a specialty veneer supplier.  You can also find a special bending ply sold, it's a plywood made with the veneer sheets all aligned (rather than perpendicular in opposing layers). Buy it in 1/8"" thick, and laminate 6 or so pieces, with a nice show veneer laminated to the outside (probably easiest to add after the main form is made).  Lastly, as an alternative, you can always use the kerf-cut MDF method, although it doesn't leave you with as solid a panel as laminated ply. You can also use bevelled pieces (like a barrel), you'll have to provide adequate internal bracing, and smooth the outside after it's all made."

I'm honored that anyone might have remembered it.  :-D  I'm thinking of rebuilding the cabinets (I still have the original template that I cut with my jig saw). I'll use the same ""rib"" construction, but with a few changes. One, the half-round of sonotube will probably be replaced with a more traditional MDF sub-enclosure, probably in a triangular or trapezoidal shape (as seen from above) to mitigate standing waves.   And when it comes to the external skin, instead of the bendable ply (which was okay, but did not result in a smooth outer skin), I want to use multiple laminated layers of 1/8"" masonite or ""hard board"" and marine epoxy. That was the construction method used on these cabinets:  http://s12.photobucket.com/user/pete_schumacher/media/Speaker%20projects/RSS315HF%203-way/DSC_0055.jpg.html  Pete brought them to a DIY show in Indiana. The speakers were just raw un-veneered cabinets then, but they were BY FAR the most inert enclosures I've ever encountered. Google ""Pete Schumacher Byzantium"" if you want more info. I think his cabinet builder was a guy that goes by ""D_Rose"" on the Parts Express forums. D_Rose or something like it, anyway.   Hardboard has an extremely smooth finish on to one side, and that would make the final veneering much easier. I'd still skim-coat all the edges with bondo to keep them crisp, though. The one downside to hardboard is that my current cabinets are very light for their size--I would estimate about 60lbs each. Hardboard will probably double that."

So, in general, if i want to measure lower Fs (say 20 Hz) i need the voltmeter to have frequency response from at least 20 Hz. Say.. 10hz- right? That is, if i want it to be accurate. Is this correct? Sorry, but i have no idea, looks like i should have paid more attention in physics class."

My MBA team is consulting with iMPOWER Systems and feel that the company has done an excellent job developing the product. We are well aware of consumers choosing tubes because they like tubes. The tube replacements offer a viable option for those who want the authentic sound of tubes while offering a durable socket replacement.  We are trying to tap into a potential market where a tube replacement makes sense.  When we performed our research on similar products we had a difficult time finding true tube replacement products over the years. This could be due to a high failure rate but we could only find products that required soldering and were not a true socket replacement for vacuum tubes. Would you mind sharing some examples over the years that have failed? This would be very helpful for accurate market research to determine if there is a potential market for this device.  We fully understand that vacuum tubes are readily available for the hobbyists and audio enthusiasts. We are not ignoring the existing market or the consumer demand for vacuum tube technology.

diyaudio,2y49uc,gimpwiz,5,Fri Mar 6 09:52:00 2015 UTC,What tip are you using on your iron? Bigger tips transfer great quicker so you can get the solder done quicker without melting the plug.  Or get better quality plugs.

diyaudio,2y49uc,roadiegod,3,Fri Mar 6 11:32:20 2015 UTC,"Try putting a junk plug into the Jack with some wire. It will work as a heatsink and help to prevent plastic from melting. Also, tin your wires first with a bit of excess, and Flux the contact. That way you just hold the wire to the contact for a split second with the wire on top and the excess solder will flow to the contact with the Flux and then remove your iron.   It should only take a half a second if your iron is the right temp. Also, try a different lead free solder in the future, there's some stuff out there that acts close to leaded."

diyaudio,2y49uc,CoryDuran,3,Sat Mar 7 02:34:33 2015 UTC,I use connectors very close to what you have there. I use a small locking hemostat clamped on the pin between the plastic body and the spot where I am soldering. It works as a great heat sink and won't allow the heat to get passed it to melt the body of the connector.
diyaudio,2y49uc,AndrewLucksNeckBeard,3,Fri Mar 6 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"I had this problem when soldering an RCA connection to my speakers. You don't need a new soldering iron. The best way around this is to pre-solder your copper wire strands with a decent amount of solder. Then thread it through the hole, bend it back, and solder it to the actual 3.5mm jack. Another tip, plug another cable into your 3.5mm jack. It will act as a heat sink and keep all the heat from being contained at the tip of the jack.

diyaudio,2y49uc,synthead,4,Fri Mar 6 11:30:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with preparing the surface by scratching it but you also need to buy a no-clean flux pen and apply flux to that before you apply heat.

diyaudio,2y49uc,GeckoDeLimon,4,Fri Mar 6 21:02:04 2015 UTC,"On what scientific or practical knowledge do you base that assessment?  I build my own PC boards and solder with both leaded and lead-free solders on a regular basis. I have found that the lead-free stuff does not wet out / reflow nearly as easily as the leaded stuff.  Part of that is the higher melting point of lead-free, and part of it is the reduction / elimination of fluxes due to toxicity concerns with both the flux and the chemicals used to remove it after manufacturing.  Soldering connectors on a wire can be even more difficult because both the connector body and wire act as effective heatsinks and tend to draw heat away from the immediate area of the connection.  Flux can help wet out the solder and draw it into the wire, making it possible to get in, get the job done, and get out...before melting any integrated plastic components."

Make sure you vacuum the area around the bench to get any splatter drops or lock the work area.  It should be off limits anyway for small children.  Lead free solder makes soldering so much harder and thus novices like you (not an insult btw) make mistakes such as those mentioned in your post.  You need a good iron, a well tinned tip, flux, a clean connector, a stable and mechanically secured joint, and 60/40 or 63/37 solder.  If you get these things right then all you need to do is hold the tip of the iron to the joint of the wire and contact, then after a few seconds push solder onto that joint and it should flow easily around and into the joint.  Once sufficient solder is applied remove it and keep the iron on for another second and remove it.  Do not move the joint until the solder solidifies.  Voila, perfectly soldered joint."

He's very curious about what I'm doing and wants to watch and I don't want to discourage that.  There are many items within your post and others (like flux) to try first, so hopefully I will have success applying that and the other tips here without the lead solder.

diyaudio,2y49uc,VEC7OR,2,Sat Mar 7 06:45:53 2015 UTC,Strip your wire and tin it. Set everything up in one of those helping hands. Put the tip on the jack's tab and immediately touch the solder to the tip. It'll melt immediately. Hold the tip in the area while drawing little circles and keep applying small amounts of solder until you see the solder bond to the tab. Remove immediately and let cool for a few seconds.   The entire procedure shouldn't take more than 3 ish seconds. Your connector melting is a sign that you're taking much longer.

Your sound will improve dramatically if you can ditch the high-to-low level converter and just go straight into one amplifier.  You care correct, the large power output of the amp shouldn't be a problem as long as you don't crank the volume. Is it 750W per channel or 750W for all channels combined?  Also, you can't just use a multimeter to measure the nominal impedance of a speaker. The multimeter is measuring DC resistance but impedance is a combination of DC resistance and AC reactance.  Is the PSU a switch mode supply? If it is, it sounds like it could be the cause of the high pitched ringing. Normally it's best to use an iron core transformer in an audio power supply because switch mode supplies have high frequency noise that can be amplified. Maybe try with another power supply to see if you can narrow down the problem"

diyaudio,2xkmif,kaliwraith,2,Sun Mar 1 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"I think ""true dual mono"" means separate power supplies for each side rather than separate volume controls and/or no balance control."
diyaudio,2xkmif,diamond_dustin,2,Sun Mar 1 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"You'll need separate power supplies for true dual mono, the reason being that sharing a common ground plane on the power supply will allow for cross talk between channels."
diyaudio,2xkmif,dewdude,2,Sun Mar 1 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"It matters for power amplifiers; but not pre-amps.  In a power amplifier; there is some concern that if you have something hitting ""hard"" it can affect the amount of power to a channel due to current draw. Your power supply only has so much current available and if one channel wants most of it; well, that's what happens. Sometimes you get a extra beefy power supply to compensate; but there is still the chance of one channel affecting the other. Yamaha had instructions with some pre-amps to use the inverted output for one channel to your power-amp and to invert the speaker leads; that mitigates the issue with bass..as an inverted bass would make each channel draw evenly.  Having discreet power supplies of course avoids that; also mitiages any chance of crosstalk between channels. But a phono amp isn't putting out gobs and gobs of power; so there's probably little advantage to a pure dual-power supply."
diyaudio,2xkmif,Krantzilla,2,Sun Mar 1 19:11:32 2015 UTC,Channel separation of a phono cartridge is typically only 20dB at 1kHz and 15dB at 10kHz and non-existent below 100Hz.  There really is no advantage in using separate power supplies for phono preamp channels.  Opamps typically have such high PSRR that separate power supplies between channels would rarely ever make an audible difference.
diyaudio,2xkmif,Zergius,2,Tue Mar 3 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"There is a little bit of danger in powering up two devices using one power supply with shared ground. With a little bit of bad luck you can get a ground loop which potentially can degrade a noise performance of your system. Before doing this, carefully consider how grounds are connected in your case.  I would rather say don't make it as a monoblock at all. As it was pointed, channel separation of a phono cartridge if pretty low. It is hard to make it any worse."

They can handel a power surge from a hard drive or 2 spinning up, but not much beyond that even high powered video cards ramp up in power slowly as to not create a surge condition.   Automotive based head decks and amps draw power as needed. They can draw .05 amps 1 second and in the time it takes the bass to hit- be drawing nearly the full 10 amps mentioned, and right back to .05 amps again. Guess what pc power supplies don't like. You can try. But I would start off low and work towards higher volume I'll bet you find a point where it's surge trip kicks in and shuts it off.   How to get around this? Add in a couple of (very) large capacitors between the head deck and the psu. You'll want 16v caps as for farad rating I'm unsure. Larg is the name of the game.

You can either buy just the cable and put your own ends on if you want custom lengths or a premade cable, then you just need 2 rca to f-type adapters.

But generally, unless you are building speakers for sheer enjoyment as a hobby, or unless yo really, really know your shit and are looking for a very specific sound/design, there is no reason to build your own. It will not save you any money, that's for sure."

diyaudio,2xgizn,MasterBettyFTW,1 point,Sat Feb 28 13:57:39 2015 UTC,I have read through quite a few threads - all of which point toward building one single enclosure (which I don't think with the resources I have I will be able to do) and I can't find out how to power the amp from batteries (ones that aren't a 12v SLA) those two areas are mostly what I was hoping for help with.
diyaudio,2xgizn,classicsat,2,Sat Feb 28 14:06:11 2015 UTC,"12V batteries come in all sizes. Bigger just means longer playback time in most cases. Look for UPS batteries. Heavy but compact and usually 12V or so.   If you are deadset on AA, you will have to wire up many many of them. I think the weight will be similar. With 9V you would want a regulator to keep voltage to 12ish I would think.   The enclosures can be seperate or common. You aren't going for actual stereo fidelity here. Maybe 10 liters per speaker? That would give them since breathing room."
diyaudio,2xgizn,lutkeveld,1 point,Sat Feb 28 14:17:14 2015 UTC,Those UPS batteries look perfect! Just one more question -  how will I go about connecting the battery to the amp? Is there a certain cable I will need? Cheers

diyaudio,2xh0sz,zim2411,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"My mother sent me a photo from a thrift store saying there were some vintage Infinity speakers for $60. I Googled quickly and determine they were RS6001's, and saw there's a pair listed for $500 on eBay. (Not that it'll sell for $500 but still.) I told her to get them, but I'm regretting that.  There's some extensive work necessary to fix these up:   One of the speakers has some extensive enclosure damage. I could maybe seal them up with wood glue? The midrange driver on the same one with enclosure damage had one broken lead -- now has two as I broke the other side trying to disconnect it. All 4 sub drivers need refoaming The tweeter/midrange potentiometers on the crossover on the speaker in good condition didn't work, and it still sounded pretty dull. I can't even remove the crossovers easily. They glued the leads to the top 3 drivers to a pass through in the bracing, and the solder points on the crossover itself are inaccessible. I'd have to cut the wires internally to remove the crossover, then deal with resoldering them when rebuilding them.   I think the EMIT tweeters are fine. I listened to the speakers briefly before taking them apart and the tweeters worked. I'm really leaning towards either selling the tweeters on their own to try and make back what I spent on the speakers, or maybe keeping them to use in a future speaker build. (But from what I've read they can be power hungry and difficult to work with, which is why Infinity abandoned using them.)  Anyone have any thoughts?"
diyaudio,2xh0sz,MentalWarfar3,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"It seems like you would have a lot of work to do to fix these back up into working order, how much did you pay for these speakers?   refoaming is cheap and doesn't take too long, if you find a good kit fixing the leads going to the speakers is pretty quick too enclose damage is gonna need some re-enforcement with wood glue and mdf. Using a clamp to put it in will probably straighten out the box. The crossover is an issue if you can't get to it, to rebuild a 3 way crossover isn't cheap. If you can better determine if anything is wrong with the crossover you can see how much a repair is gonna cost you.    If you have to start spending money on the x-over then maybe just sell the tweeters to get your cash back, cut your losses, then keep the midranges and the x-over."

diyaudio,2xanb0,pmalla,2,Fri Feb 27 00:22:17 2015 UTC,I'm interested in this topic because I have an extra pair of Polk S10 speakers with drivers from an LS70.    There are copy woofers on eBay and apparently the S10 woofers (x1 per cabinet) are normally 4 ohms and the LS70 woofers (x2 per cabinet) are 8 ohms.  The tweeters are 8 ohms for both according to the reseller mavin.com.  I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this since the speaker impedance is supposed to be 8 ohms for both of them.  I'm considering redesigning the crossover for better performance and to take into account driver impedance mismatch.  I suppose I need to measure the actual driver impedance to be sure... Unless you have any info on that.

diyaudio,2wxd80,lutkeveld,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of the STA540. Similar to the TDA7297. They are both very easy to use, and require very few external components.  However, keep in mind that you won't get much power unless you have the right power supply voltage, and also, the fidelity won't be outstanding. But I'm guessing you don't mind, considering you are building a boombox.  Another neat chip is the TPA3122D2, but it does require a largish inductor and capacitor per channel, so the added efficiency has severe implications on space."

diyaudio,2wxd80,lutkeveld,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"I'm planning something similar using the TDA7297 and two Fountek FE83 drivers in a ported enclosure; my own cheap version of a Tubecore Duo look-a-like.  Here's some additional information stolen from: http://linustechtips.com/main/topic/257962-list-of-cheap-but-good-amplifiers   1  Chip: TDA7297  Voltage range: 7-18v DC  Max output: 2x 15W  Price minimum: 3 dollars  It's a class AB chip which is often found on a 50x50mm pcb with a big heatsink.  This heatsink is needed because class AB is not very efficient and the inefficiency is converted to heat.   Nice features are the onboard potmeter (volume control), 3.5mm input, 'ON' led.   2  Chip: TA2024  Voltage range: 9-13v DC  Max output: 2x 15W  Price minimum: 6 dollar  My personal favorite. Because of the high efficiency class D chip a heatsink is not needed.  Nice I/O terminals, high efficiency, good sound.... For 6 dollars what do you want more?  3  Chip: TDA2030A  Voltage range: 7-21v AC  Max output: 2x 18W (speakers) 1x 36W (subwoofer)  Price minimum: 8 dollar  Most 2.1 amplifiers at this price point are crappy, this one is not.  It's a class AB chip, so heatsinking the chips is recommended.  Sadly it works on AC, but this can be fixed by removing the bridge rectifier next to the big electrolytics.  Then wire your + and - from the DC PSU to the output of the rectifier.  Bass/treble/volume knobs are on the nice looking PCB.  4  Chip: TPA3116  Voltage range: 18-24V  Max output: 2x 50W  Price minimum: 12 dollar  More volts, more watts.  A 19v laptop PSU brick makes a great PSU for this one.  There are also 2.1 versions of the top pcb (two chips on board)  5  Chip: TA2020  Voltage range: 9-15v DC  Max output: 20W  Price minimum: 20 dollars  Here we have him: the chip used in the famous Lepai LP2020A+  Went through a lot of crappy revisions to get to where it's at now.  Still not my favorite board, that's the one from YJ, but the Lepai has a nice case, tone control and volume knob with LED.  6  Chip: TK2050  Voltage range: 12-32v DC  Max output: 2x 50w  Price minimum: 20 dollar  7  Chip: TPA3132  Voltage range: 10-25v DC  Max output: 2x 25w  Price minimum: 7 dollar  Awesome value. Small footprint, Volume knob onboard  8  Chip: TDA7492  Voltage range: 10-26v DC  Max output: 2x 50w  Price minimum: 9 dollar  High power, can be bridged.  9  Chip: PAM8610  Voltage range: 7-15v DC  Max output: 2x 10w  Price minimum: 6 dollar  General purpose board"

Found this comparing to equivalent hakko. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP0etU7mTwU Tips are interchangeable as its essentially the same unit just made with cheaper materials (and I'm sure far less quality control). Takes a bit longer to heat up.
diyaudio,2wxkwq,skyrice,3,Tue Feb 24 01:17:05 2015 UTC,"I have a Sparkfun soldering station, which unfortunately is no longer available. It's obviously a rebranded version of a knockoff Hakko 936, probably a Yihua or Aoyue. So far it's been good, way easier to use than the $15 Weller iron or the other cheap soldering station I'd been using. The only complaints I have are the same as the guy in the video: the iron is loose in the holder, the holder sometimes slides a bit. The heat-up time is maybe 20 seconds from off to ~350°C."

I have done trial and error with a piece of pvc pipe, cut it to length then cut a c - channel in it, rubber hose will work as well, if for nothing but to test it out but the pvc can be made permanent if you like the sound better. It should result in less port noise."
diyaudio,2wtx35,drfronkonstein,3,Mon Feb 23 03:04:33 2015 UTC,"You could either spend the money on a stereo to mono converter like this: http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/MONACOR-SMC-1-/50-9042  Or you could just wire left and right + and left and right - onto the one speaker. You'll be pushing double the amount of power though so watch out. If the speaker is rated for 20W and the stereo pushes 20W per channel, the speaker will be taking ~40W so be careful. It probably will sound a bit distorted as well, and could cause some phasing issues."
diyaudio,2wtx35,Jcsul,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:26:24 2015 UTC,"If I was to use that converter, are there plug ends that I could buy? The radio has proprietary plugs (thankfully they were included) and the speakers just take standard female blade ends. So to put this in between I would need these jacks. What kind are they and how would I wire them?  I don't want to put double the power through. Could I lower the power in some way with some sort of resistor or something? Could be super cheap that way if thats possible."
diyaudio,2wtx35,krumpinjugger,2,Mon Feb 23 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"you could use an L-pad attenuator to lower the power output. An L-pad is simply two resistors, one in series with the speaker and one in parallel. Read about them here"
diyaudio,2wtx35,Jcsul,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:28:14 2015 UTC,Very grateful for that link. I'm gonna do some research on setups like that! Thank you!
diyaudio,2wtx35,Jcsul,2,Mon Feb 23 12:49:19 2015 UTC,"As far as the wiring goes, you would need 2 male RCA jacks for the input. You would take the left + and - and the right + and - out puts from the radio and wire them to the mail RCA. You can pick up mail RCA plugs just about anywhere that sells electronics components. You'd leave the proprietary plug on one end of the cable, and solder the + leads to to the tips of the RCA plugs, and then solder the - leads to the rings of the RCA jacks. Then, just run the mono output to the speaker. Probably would just need to buy and RCA cable and plug that into the output, and strip one end and solder your female blade ends to that and connect it to the speaker.   As far attenuating the signal of you choose to opt out of the mono converter box, the guy who commented below had a pretty solid solution. I'm sure you can google a calculator to find out pretty easily what resistance and wattage resistors you would need. Or you could by an attenuator, but that probably wouldn't be worth the money.   The best solution would be to cut room in the door panels and install two speakers in order to have an actual stereo set up, but if you either don't want to under take that I suppose the two afore mentioned options are the best choice."

Limiting to my exact body style (which has it's own door cards) I have the only DAF 66 Marathon Coupe in the US known to the club. DAF parts in general are as rare as flying pigs so the last thing I want to do is cut into the door panels. The dash is thin, like maybe 4 inches from the window, so above dash speakers are out of the question, and under mounts might get hectic with the already mess of wiring under there but I am considering it and then leaving the provided center speaker still unpowered.

But actually DAF did make it to the US, but way earlier than this. I believe 1960-1967 they imported some. My model here, the 1975 (which also happens to be the final year of DAF before Volvo bought them out) DAF 66 never made it to the states. The previous two models (55 and 44) didn't either (I think actually like four 44 models made it into the US officially). However DAF 600, 750, 30, 31, 32, & 33's did make it officially into the US. I have a 1965 DAF Daffodil 31 I am in the middle of restoring that was imported into NYC very late 1964.  By the way I co-direct the DAF Club of America, if you are curious as to more information, join! We are a great little group of people with a bunch of car knowledge in general, too!

If you go that route, I would suggest you get a DAC chip with a line driver (easier to design), and SPDIF reciever for the audio side. An Arduino or similar can be used to switch between the two SPDIF signals, and take signals from a remote. Relays can be used to control the power amp (will require some modding).  Everything up to here is entirely doable, as long as you're willing to learn. I recently designed a coax DAC unit and it wasn't too difficult, and adding switching and remote capability is relatively simple.  An analog input will require an additional pre-amp circuitry and more switching, again controlled by the MCU. I feel that android compatibility is too difficult for this type of project, unless you're a solid programmer (interfacing bluetooth with the MCU, writing an app for the phone).  Otherwise, just get a used reciever with coax and optical inputs, which will do everything described."

As unwanted reflections bounce around the room, we have two options: absorb the ""bad"" sound waves or break them up and scatter them. We normally focus on absorbing them, but it's possible to make a room TOO acoustically dead, so a combination of absorption and scattering is usually the answer. Panels like the ones linked operate as diffusers, and are generally used in the back half of the room after the key absorbing locations are taken care of. ""Dead front end, live back end"" as the saying goes.   If something like these panels aren't feasible, bookshelves (with a compliment of books) also make great diffusers.   One last point, if your listening / seating position is up against the back wall, stick with absorbers behind your head. The reflection off the back wall will be the most dominant reflection that reaches your ears, and it will contribute to poor imaging and a certain noisy ""vagueness"" to the sound."

diyaudio,2wbdl8,mr_pablo,9,Wed Feb 18 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"First of all, let's bring up a simple, hard, fact:   It's very hard to get beefy bass out of doors. In a car, a single 8"" subwoofer makes for an impressive amount of output. In a house, an 8"" is mostly adequate if the room is small. Out of doors, it's downright thin. This is because low frequencies travel in all directions. In a car and house, there are walls to bounce back most of that energy. Out of doors, no dice. So that right there takes away -6dB of bass energy. You kind of have to get used to that idea.   Now, you can still get pleasing bass. Not beefy or accurate, but pleasing. Take the Bose wave radio. Utterly lacks low end, but it's still pleasing to listen to because they accentuate the midbass region it CAN reproduce, and it makes the speaker sound warm and listenable.  With that in mind, let's talk parts. The idea of using the Lepai is a good one. It really likes to run off of 12v, and it's easy to find all sorts of sealed lead-acid batteries in whatever size your budget allows. Also note that the more run time, the heavier they are, regardless of manufacturer. SLA batteries are also very easy to charge. There's a simple circuit listed on this boombox build. I would recommend a 12V@4A AC-DC adaptor (shouldn't be more than £10 on eBay).  You can get bluetooth modules for $20 USD that run off of a USB power supply and output to a 3.5mm jack. Probably less now, because it has been a while since I last looked. Anyway, inside of your cabinet, you could wire up a 12V car USB adaptor and plug in the bluetooth dongle. If you got super clever, you could also wire up a USB port on the outside of the cabinet so you could charge your phone. :-D  Now, speakers, and that ""pleasing"" idea. In order to get the most of the Lepai's 10-15WPC, you're going to want highly-efficient speakers. I would turn to a pair of car audio 6x9 coaxials. Here's why:   First of all, they've sorted out a basic crossover, so you don't have to. That's HUGE.  Two, a 6""x9"" has about the same amount of cone surface area as an 8"" woofer, which will help out the bass department significantly. Three, car audio coaxials are fairly high efficiency, as a class of speaker. Since you're not going to have 100W to throw around, you need to find a speaker that makes the most of the power you DO have. Look for coaxials rated for no less than 90dB/1W/1m, and ideally more like 93dB. That's the same as doubling your amplifier power! Four, they're almost all 4ohm speakers, and that makes the Lepai happy. Five, car audio coaxials are generally ""high Q"". This means they naturally want to resonate at a given frequency (usually in the 50hz-60hz region for 6x9's). By placing them in a box instead of a car door or rear deck, this resonance is going to accentuate the bass somewhat and give us that ""pleasing"" sound. I'm skipping over a lot of the science behind this, but let me know if you're curious and I'll expound.  Six, they can often be found cheap, especially if second hand.   So I would build a box, around 1 cubic foot in volume (28L or so). Personally, I'd use 1/2"" (12mm) plywood since it's pretty durable for its weight. It doesn't even strictly need an internal divider to give each speaker its own air volume. But make the dimensions easy to carry, and use a comfortable handle, because with the two speakers and SLA battery, it's not going to be light.  Wire everything up, and away you go. If the sound ends up being a little ""chesty"", add some polyester batting to the enclosure. You can add as much as 350g if you think it needs it."
diyaudio,2wbdl8,GeckoDeLimon,2,Wed Feb 18 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Nice job on the reply. Couple of notes: -50 to 60hz is usually the -3dB point of 6x9"", they peak (due to their high Q indeed) around 100hz which gives them that full sound you need outdoors.  -A lot of brands lie about efficiency/sensitivity. Stick to known brands."
diyaudio,2wbdl8,lutkeveld,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:17:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply!   Just to clarify a few things:   6x9 - what are the numbers defining in regards to the speaker? Dimensions?  Could you link to some suitable speakers?  I understand what you mean about being outdoors with beefy bass, this will more then likely be an indoor party box (90%) an external USB charger would be great, would it be hard to wire in line with everything else?  any idea about having mains and battery?"
diyaudio,2wbdl8,GeckoDeLimon,3,Wed Feb 18 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"6x9 - what are the numbers defining in regards to the speaker? Dimensions? Could you link to some suitable speakers?   Yep. Oval. To be honest, I'm not sure how they list them in metric realms. But they're nominally 6"" x 9"". I'd have a hard time linking to some suitable speakers in the UK (I don't know what's available, or from whom), but if I were to build a system, I'd probably choose something like these. But really,  any 2-way or 3-way speaker with a fairly high sensitivity is your friend. Meet that goal, and don't worry about them being inexpensive. I can assure you, Sony used the cheapest possible speakers, too.    an external USB charger would be great, would it be hard to wire in line with everything else?   Not really. But if this is your first time doing any sort of electronics project, I'd hold that off for a later feature addition until you've got some experience under your belt. Remember you built it, you can mod it, too.    any idea about having mains and battery?   Totally possible. HOWEVER, after some review, it seems I don't understand the process of charging a sealed lead acid battery well enough, and I had better not comment. It'd be a good question for /r/AskElectronics though."
diyaudio,2wbdl8,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:25:47 2015 UTC,"Sweet.   OK some more questions    what the 2/3 way mean?  is there anyway to have a ""sub"" in this setup, or would it need a different amp?  forgoing plywood for the enclosure, if I managed to get  a cubic foot from something like a flight case/el cheapo pelican case knock off, would that work?"
diyaudio,2wbdl8,GeckoDeLimon,2,Wed Feb 18 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"what the 2/3 way mean?   A speaker having a woofer and tweeter is a 2-way. A speaker having a woofer, tweeter, and midrange is a 3-way. A 4-way also exists, but skip them because they're hokey and don't add any real value when that same materials cost could have gone into making the rest of the speaker better.    is there anyway to have a ""sub"" in this setup, or would it need a different amp?   Don't. You would indeed need a different amp (the Lepai with the subwoofer output is complete ass, and should be avoided). The two 6x9"" coaxials will move as much air as a pair of 8"" woofers. They'll play louder and likely lower than the Sony thing your buddy has.    forgoing plywood for the enclosure, if I managed to get a cubic foot from something like a flight case/el cheapo pelican case knock off, would that work?   Sure, if the enclosure is rigid enough, and seals (mostly) air tight."

diyaudio,2wbdl8,GeckoDeLimon,3,Wed Feb 18 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"6""x9"" became a standard because wherever you can fit a 6"" speaker, there's generally a little more room to the sides, so automakers started using that extra space. Think of the shape of the parcel shelf in a sedan.   8"" coaxials are not common, and a 6x9 moves about as much air as an 8"" speaker, but costs about the same as a 6"" round one.

diyaudio,2wbdl8,lutkeveld,2,Wed Feb 18 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"Just a little input for you. The amp pushes 20 watts per channel. Most stock car stereos weigh in at about 20-30 watts per channel, but actual ""loudness"" is determined by a lot of different things.   I know OP recommended some speakers to use, but if you're worried about volume and don't much care about price just find the most efficient speakers you can. Look for the ""sensitivity"" rating of whatever size speakers you go with. 90db and up is a pretty efficient speaker and will give you more volume. The basic rule of thumb is the higher the sensitivity the more volume squeezed out of every watt."
diyaudio,2wbdl8,Jcsul,1 point,Wed Feb 18 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"Don't let them fool you. Car stereos can't get around physics laws.

diyaudio,2wbdl8,lutkeveld,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:59:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, The cardboard worked well to keep things light, but I would recommend something more durable.  This Lapai based boombox used much better materials for the box than I did. I love how it looks.  For the speakers, These would be the equilvalent of what I used. I didn't mention it in my build log, but the first version actually used much cheaper 4"" Pyle brand car speakers.  They were awful.  No bass at all.  So I swapped them out for the Kickers and there was a very large improvement.  If you don't mind going bigger than I did, These would have more bass yet.  It's not going to rattle your windows or anything, after all they are just 6.5"" speakers.  But I think you would find they are significantly more powerful than you average boom box.  Edit: Forgot to answer the ""How loud is it?"" question:  It will go very loud.   Certainty louder than your average shouting level.  If I am within 10 feet of it I can turn it up loud enough that I can't hear my own awful singing.  I have used it as the music source in a roughly 12x12 room with 5 or 6 fairly rowdy people drinking, and hanging out.  At around 1/2 volume it easily overpowered the ambient noise from people in the room.  I can say that several other little boomboxes I have tried over the years were not up to that task."

You could even marble good quality paper and use that instead but it might not last as long."
diyaudio,2wab1f,lankykiwi,1 point,Wed Feb 18 07:47:04 2015 UTC,"Swirling vinyl is a good idea, didn't think of that yet. Though it would be very hard to get a swirl pattern on the vinyl which gives a continous result once wrapping the speakers.  For MDF I thought of sealing the complete cabinet on the inside and outside with the bottom missing. All holes already cut, maybe filling the small screw holes for terminals and speaker with silicone or glue which can be drilled out again afterwards."

You might be able to rig something up with a small pc like a raspberry pi, but anything you do find or make will probably cost a lot more than a set of speakers with a 3.5mm jack.  Alternately, you can open the speakers up and solder a 3.5mm input in bypassing the DAC.   If you're handy with an iron, that might be the best option."
diyaudio,2waivu,eldorel,3,Wed Feb 18 09:13:12 2015 UTC,"The opposite of a DAC is an ADC. I'm pretty sure you can get some tracking ADC ICs which utilised op amps, but it may be a bit difficult to setup everything (the USB transfer protocol may be a big issue for direct conversion). It sounds like a cool project to work on for someone with the skills, but may be hard otherwise"
diyaudio,2waivu,novastorm17,0,Wed Feb 18 12:01:28 2015 UTC,Seems that this will be harder than i first anticipated.  i figured that if DAC's existed surely something like what i want exists and is relatively straight forward but apparently not. Thanks for the info
diyaudio,2waivu,classicsat,3,Wed Feb 18 13:12:34 2015 UTC,"USB is not simply an ADC, it is more or less a full blown USB sound card, which requires a host.  Get speakers with analog in, or mod the ones she has to have analog in."
diyaudio,2w8wa8,fuimani,0,Tue Feb 17 22:57:53 2015 UTC,Using a crossover on a 6ohm speaker designed for 8ohms is going to shift the crossover frequency.   The other thing to consider is the sensitivity of the replacement drivers. Are they identical to the original drivers or different? This is also going to change the intended sound.   Looks like it might be easier to build yourself a new crossover.
diyaudio,2w8wa8,Grendal,1 point,Wed Feb 18 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"I know that changing the impedance of the drivers connected to a crossover changes the crossover point, but I don't know in what way, and nor am I having any luck on finding how.  It does look like I'll have a better time building a custom crossover, no matter the case - 6 ohm crossovers don't appear to exist pre-built."
diyaudio,2w8wa8,Grendal,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:28:24 2015 UTC,I think you would would need the required formulas for deriving crossover component values for a lowpass/highpass frequency. Work backwards from this equation to find out what the affect speaker impedance has on the this setpoint.   I think u'll find it easier to use a crossover calculator and make a new one from scratch.

Basically you want it to look like this http://www.daenotes.com/images/CLC-pi-filter.png where ""RL"" is just a placeholder for your amp.  This will create a simple Butterworth low pass filter with a rolloff at 20Hz. Any high frequency components on the line will be removed and a very large portion of the 60Hz/120Hz hum will also be attenuated.  If this doesn't fix it, the noise is getting in another way and we'll have to look at other options in addition to this filter."

Can it handle 12.8V or more when being charged?  The batteries are certainly over 12V, not sure if this is designed for like clean 12.0V supply.  Have you tried big audio caps on the 12V near the board? What size/how long are the wires from the batteries to audio board? Is this shared with other electronics."
diyaudio,2w5eba,seb21051,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:26:10 2015 UTC,"All three batteries are 12V nominal tied in parallel, everything in the system (it's a boat) connects on a few buss bars which are all at equivalent potential. Measured 12.8V at the bus bars, that is with everything connected and the chargers running.  The input range is ideally 12V but according to the datasheet its operating range is 8.5-13.2 with an absolute maximum of 16V. So it should be fine for when the batteries are being charged by the gas engines.  I have 16gauge wire, about 15' between the bus bars and the amplifier.  I can do some capacitors in parallel with the amplifier board, but there is a LOT of noise, I'll see how that helps."
diyaudio,2w5eba,ehcanadian7,2,Tue Feb 17 04:06:37 2015 UTC,"Well the voltage at board is 0.3V less than battery because of IR drops. Which shouldn't matter too much.  If the 15' run is next to AC line from and inverter, that can add the 60 hz.  Use 2 caps where the board is powered. One large as reasonable for price, whatever, and one about 100 times less capacitance in parallel across the 12V supply.  Or maybe a small marine battery, so it would be a fourth in parallel and charge through the 16ga.  Also slap on some ferrite beads if you get rf from engine, but it is probably diesel. And probably only impacts AM/FM"

diyaudio,2w3fv7,metajames,1 point,Mon Feb 16 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"Belden cable and switchcraft connectors. You can use a mic cable for extreme durability like a Belden 1776 but usually for line level we use 9451. Switchcraft makes a line of heavy duty 3.5mm plugs and jacks (35HD) just make sure the cable clamp and connector body is suitable for the diameter cable you are using. You can buy everything from markertek, full compass or some other broadcast supply or pro audio supply house.   But honestly if you are going through pre built cables your probably not treating them very well, a retail cable where the connector body is injection molded onto the cable is pretty durable. As long as you are not stretching, straining or wrapping/winding the cable (always coil over under) you shouldn't be having durability problems. If your cables are falling apart because you are abusing them then building a cable out of ""pro"" parts isn't going to change anything.

diyaudio,2w0j51,jtn19120,7,Sun Feb 15 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"The big difference is that the paper cone woofers are a bit easier to work with. They both share the same low-distortion motor design--same shorting rings and cap on the pole piece. However, the paper cones are slightly more damped internally, which means they have a lesser tendency to ring like a bell than the aluminum cone.   The aluminum RS180 is extremely rewarding in its detail, but notoriously hard to work with because of the breakup nodes that occur in the upper frequency response. If used in a 2-way, the best crossovers were around 1.8khz, using either crazy 8th order cauer-elliptical filters or series crossovers (which did about the same thing). Even a 4th order LR would leave noticeable remnants of the breakup--usually as audible grit and less-audible listening fatigue. The peaks are that severe. If you're thinking of doing a 2-way...I hope you have an extremely robust tweeter.  The paper cone trades a smidge of detail for a smidge better handling of the breakup. The peaks are still there, but of a lower Q and magnitude. The two woofers are different enough that I do not feel like one can be swapped for the other without changes to the crossover to account for the difference in top end behavior. Keep that in mind if you're looking at building a pre-existing design."

diyaudio,2vxkqi,TaterTotsForLunch,2,Sun Feb 15 01:58:08 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have a problem using the Dayton instead of the HiVi. The Dayton does have a 1-2 db higher sensitivity, so if that bothers you, you can change the divider values on the high pass to attenuate a bit more. Change the 1.5ohm and 6ohm resistors to say 3ohm and 5ohm. But I honestly don't think it will be needed."
diyaudio,2vxkqi,mottld,1 point,Sun Feb 15 04:21:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information.  I know practically nothing about crossover design and am generally happy just building existing designs.  I guess I might have to venture out of my comfort zone a bit.   I looked up the crossovers for both the ND20FA-6 and HiVi T20 versions of the OS MT.  The only difference between the two is the resistor in parallel with the tweeter; 10ohm with the Dayton and 15ohm with the HiVi.  I'm wondering now if all that needs to be changed on the MMTMM to accommodate the Dayton tweeter is a similar reduction in the value of the parallel resistor.  This would be a change from 6ohm to 4ohm.  Maybe I dunno.  I really have no idea.  But I guess I could build it this way and try it?
diyaudio,2vxkqi,mottld,2,Sun Feb 15 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"Well that is what my reply stated. R1 and R2 create a voltage divider. This controls the amount of signal hitting the tweeter. By lowering R2(the one across the tweeter terminals) you are lowering the ratio presented. Since the Dayton has a higher sensitivity (louder than the HiVi with the same signal presented by 1-2db) you want to lower the signal to make the output equal to the HiVi design.  Everything before those two resistor creates the high pass filter. Both tweeter have the same frequency range, so you dont have to change the filter section."

diyaudio,2vxmfl,truls-rohk,1 point,Sun Feb 15 05:00:33 2015 UTC,The mids and highs running out of the halfler work fine. The stereo setup for the subs is not. I decided to alter the design of the mtm speakers because I was not satisfied with the bass. The subwoofers are sealed in the lower level of the mtm and wired separately from the mtm. The inuke has a crossover built in. The subwoofers and inuke were a afterthought. The speaker wire in the album above were originally made to be just for the mtm. I realized that it was overkill and I didn't want to run two sets of wire to each speaker. So I rewired and used an ohm meter to make sure that I had the correct ends paired. So now I have two separate wires in one loom. I am not happy with the xlr adapter that parts express suggested. The rcas are very loose but still make contact. If I have to I may grab some cheap wire while I am at Walmart today and connect the subs separately and see if the issue changes.
diyaudio,2vxmfl,truls-rohk,1 point,Sun Feb 15 13:26:26 2015 UTC,Ok let me try to help here. never set the inuke to bridge while both woofers are connected. You could check if it's the amp by switching the inputs around on it.   If the sub that's working switches as well then you likely have an issue with the input chain

diyaudio,2vxmfl,classicsat,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"Cool, figured it was wiring issue. If you still feel like you have to jack the gains way up on the inuke,  I would instead turn the gains down on the Mtm amp. You don't want clipping."

I would try to look around and find a cheap modern receiver that has a ""maximum volume"" setting, this seems like it would be good for your use case. The receiver can handle your bass boost and then just use any sort of cheap speakers as long as they're big.  An alternative could be a soundbar with a subwoofer out."

diyaudio,2vpqz2,rougetoxicity,1 point,Sat Feb 14 09:14:07 2015 UTC,"What stats would you comprimise for that? Softer suspension, higher Mms or less magnet all give you a less tight bass at the main bass frequency range - additional bass at earth-quake frequencies always comes at the price of the quality of the main bass frequencies (unless you build a horn as big as a room, in wich case the fs of the chassis used doesn't really matter anyway). I like this comprimise."

diyaudio,2vja6h,EightyJay,5,Wed Feb 11 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"I've looked at those woofers. They're certainly value leaders. I'm considering a pair myself.   By going sealed, you will lose some 20Hz output, but after dialing in the crossover, the sealed-box F3 is about 31Hz and roll-off on the bottom end is fairly shallow. It'll be down -6dB at 20hz, but IMHO the importance of that last half octave is overplayed. In addition to proper gain and crossover settings, what's more important to the perceived depth and ""dig"" of a subwoofer is room placement, and it'll be a hell of a lot easier to strategically place a 4 cubic foot enclosure than that Stonehenge monster. :-)  That reminds me...if your subwoofers require two people to move around the room, put it on casters. :-D  You'll also want about 24oz of polyfil or fiberglass stuffing per 4 cubic foot enclosure since it's smaller than ""ideal"". They really prefer a 5 cubic foot box, but it does allow them greater short-term power handling. What are you planning for amplification?  EDIT: I just saw the size of the stonehenge, and as an option, it's out. 5.4 cubic feet, and the Stereo Integrity requires no less than 9. That box only lowers the F3 to 25Hz, so there's not a lot of point for the added size."

diyaudio,2vja6h,GeckoDeLimon,3,Wed Feb 11 23:09:52 2015 UTC,"You got it. Not maximizing the potential for low frequency output. But there are reasons to undersize and tune low. Namely, it increases power handling at super low frequencies while still behaving and sounding an awful lot like a sealed box. But since this thing has excursion for days, it really doesn't need that help in the power handling dept.   Long story short, it WILL play a little louder from 20-30Hz, while not being completely unreasonable in size. Some find that worthwhile."
diyaudio,2vja6h,dorri732,0,Thu Feb 12 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"5.4 cubic feet, and the Stereo Integrity requires no less than 9.   Bullshit.  The Stereo Integrity website says 5-6 cubic feet for the HT 18 sub."
diyaudio,2vja6h,GeckoDeLimon,6,Thu Feb 12 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"If they said ""9-10 cubic feet for the ideal enclosure"", they'd probably sell fewer. I'm not saying they're lying, but they aren't recommending the optimal box for frequency response. But to some, a reasonable box size may be ""optimal"", so here we are.   (shrug) I modeled it in both WinISD Pro Alpha and Unibox. The box Stereo Integrity describes would have about half the output possible low frequency extension of the optimal box.

Using those parameters and this handy tool Link, one can plot expected frequency response for various configurations. I am not sure as to the accuracy of that tool in particular, but plugging in the values shows us exactly what we already know: the ported box will give more extension, but the sealed box will sound more natural. Essentially, the only question is do you want to have bass down to 20 Hz? If so, you need to go ported. If extension is less important than accuracy, go sealed."
diyaudio,2vja6h,psychicSPD,1 point,Wed Feb 11 19:29:36 2015 UTC,Pardon my ignorance but extension is how low the bass will go in terms of frequency?
diyaudio,2vja6h,splitsecnd,3,Wed Feb 11 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"Yep! On my screen here, the parameters the mfg. provided shows that the ported box gives us a -3 dB (or half power point) of 21.43 Hz. That is pretty damn low. On the other hand, even though that is earth shattering bass, the way a ported enclosure works basically means that we lose a bit of fidelity. The ported enclosure can't make square waves as good as the sealed enclosure, so your booms will be louder but will not be quite as accurate as the sealed box. The sealed box has a -3 dB point of 31.63, filling may change that though (this calculator assumes no filling)  Edit: ported box specs are based on IDEAL box. if we follow mfg. specs for sealed box, -3 point becomes 32.29 Hz. ported box becomes much smaller, ideal box would have been over 10ft3 whereas mfg suggests about 5.5ft3 to keep it sane. You wont get 20hz bass with either, but you can with a superbox"

I have a single 15 ported running only 400 watts and I have found that proper placement is more important than extra wattage. If it really comes down to one of those 2 flat packs I would say go ported since the size difference won't be that big from sealed to ported.

diyaudio,2vblq0,BabyExploder,2,Mon Feb 9 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"Very old passive EQs didnt even have the make up stage - instead there was large insertion loss when using the unit, but the engineer was expected to follow it up with a separate line/pre amp of their choice. Passive EQs are still used in the recording world (usually inductor based), but the makeup amp is built into the unit and without a neg feedback loop to the filters."
diyaudio,2vblq0,WingerRules,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say that's up to semantics.  I get what you're saying though. I know a passive EQ wouldn't be able to actual boost a signal at all, and would result ultimately in some loss of signal. The gainclone has a fairly low input sensitivity, but I'd be willing to go powered if that's the only option for getting within the signal range needed."
diyaudio,2vblq0,Bodark43,1 point,Mon Feb 9 20:15:36 2015 UTC,"I think if you expect to be having some specific annoyances- like, way too much bass response around 100 Hz- you can think in terms of a passive filter ( that would be high pass, to roll-off low frequencies)  you could play with some simple RC combinations to see what sounds good, then put it into the box.  But if you want to play with different bands, something that's active ( like the one above with an op-amp) will be more practical."

diyaudio,2v84z7,skyrice,3,Sun Feb 8 21:59:25 2015 UTC,"I used a circular saw for the straight edges. To get them straight I crafted my own jig, thinking that I was clever. However I realised a little bit too late that the provided-guide, with the circular saw, allowed me to cut quicker, almost as straight (nothing that some filing/sanding wouldn't take care of), but most importantly the guide allowed me to be more accurate than my jig.  My wood-work experience at school consisted of sanding a block of wood and drilling 16 holes into it and calling it a pencil holder. Student of least resistance, me! Don't let no wood working experience hold you back; ignorance and enthusiasm will get you going and hopefully your wallet is deep enough to see the project through to the end.  The speaker holes were cut with a plunge router. It was the first time for me using both tools."
diyaudio,2v84z7,fathobbit,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:45:04 2015 UTC,You should go for it. Before I could afford a table saw I used this in combination with a circular saw to cut up 4'x8' sheets. If you are careful and clamp it securely you can make perfect cuts. A router and a circle jig make cutting the holes perfectly round very easy.

It also helps direct the sound better.   so theoretically if properly implemented it makes crossover design easier.  I'm also looking at that tweeter for a build and it seems like it's not generally a good idea to cross it much lower than 2k even with a 4th order design"
diyaudio,2v8mn4,ogurzhov,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:10:39 2015 UTC,Best bet if keeping those speakers and crossovers (assuming they are still fully functional) would be to measure the volume of the original box and make custom one to suit.

An experiment like that is something you do on a cheap pair of speakers you don't care if you ruin the sound of (like daytons or something).  You'd be better off building a pair of mono amplifiers and mounting them to the outside of the speaker box.    Honestly though and I've said this before amps are one of the worst things you can DIY from scratch unless you're doing it for fun and learning only. Bang for your buck DIY is actually much, much worse for amplifiers than it is for some of the excellent cheap amps you can get (like those SMSL SA50s)."

diyaudio,2v73yt,swrrga,1 point,Sun Feb 8 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"A small point: Building a ""great"" or ""audiophile-quality"" amp is indeed difficult, and more expensive than just buying one off the shelf.  Building a ""good enough"" amp is pretty easy and fun, especially if you're just going to buy a kit and solder it together. Velleman sells some easy kit amps, I built their 2 x 5W amp (since discontinued) that I'm quite happy with. It sounds great to me, but then again I'm a musician, not an audiophile.  My advice would be to invest in a good amp if you care about making your setup ""nice"", but don't let that stop you from tinkering around with the $ 20-30 kit stuff for fun."
diyaudio,2v73yt,GeckoDeLimon,3,Mon Feb 9 02:28:41 2015 UTC,"Depending upon where you plan to use them, even 15wpc would be enough. That would allow the use of the Dayton DTA-2. It's like $20, and is basically same internals as the DTA-1 and very similar to the Lepai LP2020."
diyaudio,2v73yt,prozackdk,3,Sun Feb 8 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"In general I agree with /u/StarkyA. There are some drop in full range plate amps, but they're bigger than your Overnight Sensations cabinets.   Parts Express does have amp boards, but the decent ones aren't particularly cheap, and you still have to figure out how to mount them (heatsink on the outside of the enclosure), and provide power. At the end of the day you've spent a good bit of money for something that's as big as the whole speaker itself.  If I were set on making an active speaker, I'd pick something like this from PE. You can attach the amplifier chip to a heatsink on the backside of your enclosure and the circuit will take up very little volume. You'd need a panel with signal input and DC power (3 wires). You need to mount the board at a 90 deg angle to the heatsink. This module requires bipolar DC input so you'd have to make a bipolar power supply with rectifiers and filter caps, place it into an enclosure with connectors to feed power to both speakers. This is a lot of work and not for someone inexperienced with electronics, but right up my alley if I were 20 years younger :P."

diyaudio,2v1v0g,jersauce,4,Sat Feb 7 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"So I have finished and am listening to the first one (I had two sets cut). Some pictures of the assembly process and some thoughts I want to share.  These are not cosmetically finished and will have a cherry veneer with bees wax & walnut oil polish, likely this summer.  My thoughts:   CNC cutting these panels out of 18 mm 4B Baltic Birch was WAY more expensive than I had anticipated. The guy I used was local and probably has a lower end CNC machine, as his largest bit was 1/4"" diameter and could only cut 1/4"" deep in one pass (for a smooth cut). Total cost for the two sub enclosures was just over $400, including the $115 for the 4B plywood. Even with the expense, the CNC cutting was AWESOME. As can be seen in the pictures, everything fits together PERFECTLY!! I did a lot of work ahead of time doing up the CAD drawings to get the fit and cutting that I wanted. The front baffle is about 1 mm too wide, but I will route that and get it back down to size. The back panel I had to chisel a bit off to get it to fit in, but no air gaps anywhere. I very much like working with the 4B plywood. For the driver, I used threaded inserts so that I could remove and install it a number of times if needed, but the amp and feet were installed with regular wood screws. Clamps clamp clamps. I used 12 clamps to put this together, plus C clamps to hold the panels square (first picture shows the square I had made). If I did this again, I would make a larger square, as the one I used was under-sized and so there was still some un-squareness. Also, I would have two of them (or four, so I can glue up two separate pieces at a time). Spring clamps would definitely NOT be suitable to hold the pieces square while gluing up and clamping (I had thought about using spring clamps to reduce purchase cost, but glad I did not). I think I used more clamp force than necessary to put these together. Now on to the sound: The one I have built so far is on par with my expectations. However, I'm at about $700 to $800 in cost for two subwoofers (plywood, CNC machine time, amplifiers, drivers, screws, feet) and so my expectations were high. These blow away the Klipsch RPW10 that I was using, in terms of F3 achieved and level of distortion. I can't wait to get the second one up and running. I'm getting a response down to 20 Hz, and likely would get lower...but I need to get a new program to do this as sigjenny does not work on Windows 8.1. I had a lot of concerns about SPL of this build, being that it's an 8"" driver. This hasn't been an issue, however, I must admit that I have small children in the house and do not care for listening above 75 to 85 dB peak for movies / TV, so having only one of these in a relatively large room (L shape dining room + family room plus opening to front entrance way) of about 800 square feet has not been an issue. I have not yet maxed out the single subwoofer capacity.  Second one seems a little overkill now, but I need another stand!"
diyaudio,2v1v0g,Rullknufs,2,Sat Feb 7 02:12:50 2015 UTC,There can never be too many clamps.  You mentioned having trouble keeping it square. If you CNC-cut the ply like I did here http://phimusic.blogspot.se/search/label/HAD%20Oy (you may have to scroll down a bit). That will make it easier to keep square. You can see what I mean if you look at the big side panels.

The square I made was too small for the job (5"" per side).  I should have done at least 6 or 7"".  Really, though, the one I have built is satisfactory and the squareness was really not an issue.  This is more or less a note for future builds / lessons for other people."

I don't care what kind of reviews C\Net gave it; they are not an authority for hi-fi.  Those speakers are too inefficient for a proper setup; granted that subwoofer has it's own supply and will likely be able to handle the dynamics of gaming; at 85dB the rest of your speakers are going to require quite a bit of power to get any real sound out of them. Tube amps with any power = money.  Strictly speaking; you're going to need say 5 monoblocks at 50 watts each, that's a LOT of money. Transformers aren't cheap; the tubes that put out that kind of power aren't cheap. One 50W monoblock will likely run you more than what the entire speaker setup runs.  Do you want to put $1000 worth of tube equipment on $100 speakers? The answer is no; you don't.  The problem with tube amps is that cheap ones sound horrible; and the ones that sound OK and don't approach ""super fancy"" are still expensive. I paid $200 for mine; that was a steal....$200 usually doesn't buy you two restored vintage monoblock chassis...it might buy you one worn out chassis that needs rebuilding.  But you're thinking ""but I'm going to build one!""; that's not any cheaper. You're looking at close to $200 in transformers per monoblock; maybe $300 in transformers per ""stereo"" amp if they share a power transformer...you're not gonna power all 5 off the same thing. Buying old transformers is a luck of the draw...and you don't want to have a mixed variety; monoblocks are difficult enough to get balanced.  While I love the idea; realistically, it just can't be worth it. If you were serious and putting better speakers in to it; maybe...but you're still looking at a lot of coin just to ""play games"".  Stick to the solid-state...that's the only thing that's going to give you the oomph and dynamics you need for gaming while being cheap enough to be justified for your speaker system. Leave the tube stuff for 2.0 stereo playback...on good efficient speakers."

You are asking for a system that has 2.5x the normal number of channels of amplification, with no regard to whether your speaker selection is appropriate and you are asking for it to be cheap.   It's not going to happen and even if you do make it happen using some bargain basement ebay purchases, it's going to sound far worse than a solid state system that you could get for less money."

I know parts express sells solid state amps for 2.1 systems. Maybe two tube preamps powering two of those? One for fronts/center and one for rear/sub? Or if all you want is looks you could just rig up a solid state in a box with some tubes sticking out and power up the heater circuits so they glow all pretty.

A true 5.1 system is divided into front L&R, rear L&R, center, and a crossover to feed the sub. With 3 stereo amps you would end up feeding either a left or right channel exclusively into your center channel and sub. Honestly tubes are more for music than gaming or surround sound. You could set up a standard two channel stereo set up with some high quality speakers but in the end you're not gaining much because your feeding a digital audio source into the amp."

Is captain foldback's schematic a match and likely to help a rank beginner with the inevitable palaver that comes with DIY repurposing?  Are the plates tied to ground through a cap to effect that 8kHz cutoff?  What kind of distortion are we looking at when driving those speakers to a reasonable level, let alone flat out?  Even in the distortion-friendly tube idiom, I'd wager it would be something pretty heinous.  Is that amp meant for 16ohm speakers only or are there taps for different impedances?  What's with the mismatched output transformers?  Will all four handle full-range output nicely?  It's excellent that you're enjoying a similar setup but I doubt the OP could see it to a satisfactory conclusion, unless it's really as simple as ""have tubes, have speakers, have some kind of sound coming out""."
diyaudio,2v0hwe,chazmotazz,2,Sat Feb 7 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"You are right, it does take a little work:   The Schematics on Captain Foldback are the correct ones. If you look at them you will see no evidence of high frequency filtering on the Output Tube plates. The outputs are specified for 16 ohms, without other options. Recapping it cost me about $10. I took out the originals and replaced all the sections with 100uF 450V radials.   http://www.ebay.com/itm/100uF-450V-Radial-Electrolytic-Capacitors-Test-Equipment-10PCS-20-40-150-New-/330756592249?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4d02a11279  I also replaced all the rectifiers with 1N4007s.   Drilling the Chassis to accept a power cable (XLR) socket, power switch, Indicator, Fuse, 1/4"" input and output sockets took a little time. The Ganged channels obviously have to be split. The large OPT is for the bass, therefore greater energy delivery. I use it with three AR wall mount Speakers from a 6.1 set and an old reconed ESS 1000 for the bass.  I figure both have a sensitivity of around 92dB. Thus far I have found distortion appearing at very high volume.  I was surprised at how loud these things can be.  I do not usually listen to them at full blast.   My expectations were not excessive, and I know its not a ""Hi-Fi"" amp, but I find it satisfies my requirements very well.    The Amp and replacement components cost me under $120, so I consider that to be very good value and sound for the money.   The specs show 4% distortion @ 17W for class AB1:  http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/093/6/6BQ5.pdf  Obviously lower figures may be achieved with 43% Ultra linear Outputs, but that was out of scope for me.

Those speakers won't have the sensitivity to be a good pairing with low power tube amplification.  Remember, power doesn't come cheap with tubes. In addition, if you are using the standard 5.1 line outs from your motherboard you will find that the sound quality will be held back by the inferior D/A and pre-amplification offered by the onboard sound circuitry.   If you want to add a little tube  sound to the mix, put a stereo tube buffer in line with your L&R channels.  That will add a bit of tube warmth to the channels where the most music is coming from.  You can also position it wherever for the appearance you are after. You might have some delay/timing issues with the other channels, though.  A receiver/surround processor with DSP could probably correct that if you care."

diyaudio,2v0hwe,AndrewLucksNeckBeard,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason you are doing this?  My dad built a 5.1 home theater amp with tubes by gutting some old Grommes amps he had lying around, splicing them into this mutant multi-channel abomination, and running line-level signals through the input (no preamps or rectifiers).  It was horrible.  It was absolutely unlistenable.  Each channel had its own EQ and volume, the ""head unit"" he created was an indecipherable mess of unlabeled switches and knobs, fiddling with any controls resulted in a long farting noise followed by a series of clicks and pops.  Eventually he added a rectifier circuit and some preamps so you could actually hear what was going on, but the sound was tinny and distorted.    That said, it did function like a 5.1 setup (powered subwoofer, the only thing that sounded somewhat normal) and once we cleaned up the wiring and oiled the potentiometers we eliminated most of the clicks and pops, but it was impossible to get a consistent sound out of each channel, no matter how you fiddled with the EQ.  One speaker sounded like a megaphone, one had an inexplicable reverb, one sounded like it was underwater, there was just no uniformity between the channels.  anyway, my dad knew it was going to be a clusterfuck right from the get-go, he just did it because he was sitting on a bunch of old amps, had a free weekend, and wanted to see if it was even possible.  Most of the problems probably were a result of the age of the amps and tubes, but even accounting for that, it would have sounded like garbage.  His conclusion was that ""tube amps are meant for guitars and phonographs, not digital applications"".    Ever since that day i have held on to that philosophy.  If the sound is encoded digitally, there is absolutely no advantage in running the signal through a tube amp as opposed to a solid-state.  Unless you spring for a super high-end setup you are wasting your money and comprimising sound quality.  if you are like my dad and just want to see if it can be done, i can send you the remains of my Dad's mutant home theater (it was taken apart and scrapped but still has some usable parts)"

Measure out the internal enclosure volume for the vented system, subtracting the space taken up by the port. Then build a sealed box that is 2/3 the size of the existing box. It'll have you in the ballpark. From there, the sound can be tweaked by the addition of polyfill stuffing.   All that said...don't do it. Stay vented. I think you'll be surprised exactly how much output you'll lose by going sealed. You'll probably have to dial down the crossover knob further than before, and you'll have to increase the gain on the amp, too.

I think that is the only place a limitation lies, where I don't think it's possible to wire with this configuration.  As to the concern you mention, I'm having a hard time visualizing it, but I think that's possible with the correct wiring. I think you split the input signal up six ways, then wire to each pot/switch which either passes the signal to the FX, or the straight output to the mixer. Unless I totally don't understand how you intend for this to operate."
diyaudio,2us8nr,substrate80,2,Wed Feb 4 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the idea, that I want to use the same effects box for many instruments. That's exactly the limitation I'm trying to overcome.   So, basically, each instrument goes through 5 pots, each pot directs some of the signal to a different output on the box. The signals from each signal, are summed to each output... this is really hard to describe. Off to paint.. brb.  Here's a simplified version, with 3 instruments and three effects  So, you can see that instrument 1 (blue) will work just like a normal insert effect, if the pot is all the way left, we get a dry signal, all the way wet, all of it is sent to the reverb. That's all good, but lets say that instrument 2 also has reverb turned all the way wet, so none of the signal will go to the delay.   So that's the idea... I know there are various ways to deal with the level of the signal at each point, but I'm hoping someone has a good sense of what I'm trying to accomplish and can offer a tip on which way to do it. As I have it drawn up now, you just have to be aware of where your knobs are, and not turn all of them up enough that you get no signal out, but then if you want to turn one knob up, you have to turn all the others down.   Hope that explains it? Thanks for the response!"
diyaudio,2us8nr,drtonmeister,3,Wed Feb 4 21:19:27 2015 UTC,If you want to DIY then a simple opamp summing circuit will provide you the ability to take in any number of signals and sum them together for output to your effects circuit.
diyaudio,2us8nr,zimmermanstudios,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:21:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, that'll get me out to the FX units, my problem is that I need to split a signal multiple ways, and somehow make them all add up to 100% (sort of)  So if I have the signal dry, it's going out 100% to the mixer... if I turn up FX1, to 50% I need it to now magically be going out dry 50% and FX1 50%. now if I turn up FX2 to 50% I need the signal to magically go 33% dry, 33% FX1 33% FX2. I think."
diyaudio,2us8nr,zimmermanstudios,2,Thu Feb 5 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, sounds like more opamp summing circuits downstream of the FX circuits.  When I get home from work I'll see if I can sketch something."

diyaudio,2us8nr,zimmermanstudios,2,Fri Feb 6 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"So bring the 5 synths into 5 inputs of your mixer. Then use the mixers channel insert jacks to split the 5 signals to an external matrix mixer. Feed 5 outputs of the matrix to your 5 effects, and then bring the 5 effects outputs into mixer stereo inputs #6-#10. Then the dry synth is on a fader of your mixing console, and the FX return on another fader that you kind of leave fixed in level. If you want the sound of that synth to be more dry, you turn up the dry fader for that synth, if you want it more wet, you turn up the aux knob. Where this gets wiggy is when you have several sources to that aux to that effect and find you are overdriving it -- then you would turn down the aux send master, and turn up the aux-return an equivalent amount. If you find a synth is overall too loud in the mix but the wet/dry blend is perfect, turn it down on the mixer preamp-knob, that will cut wet and dry equally."

diyaudio,2uo2cp,raptorlightning,2,Fri Feb 6 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"Usually when undertaking a DIY project, people opt for making individual components with high degrees of cohesion to facilitate component customization. Instead of a unified receiver you'd find people making power amps, preamps, passive line stages, phono preamps, DACs, FM tuners, etc. separately. This allows for fewer constraints in design and the ability to tweak individual components without incapacitating the entire system.  Just food for thought..."
diyaudio,2uo2cp,leica_boss,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:38:07 2015 UTC,"I think it would be simple to do a traditional stereo receiver, but I would take it in two different paths:  1) A compact unit for desk use by the computer, would need to incorporate a dac, pre-amp, headphone amp, and power amp. This gets costly though, and difficult to do well in a small size, such that I should probably just cave and buy a Teac.  2) An AV receiver/processor. The problem here is I don't see a good method for doing what an off the shelf AV receiver does best, switching and being a 7.1 DAC for HDMI sources. I wish there was more DIY gear/info in that regard. As far as pre and power amplification, this should be straightforward, just 5 or more channels instead of stereo. Also, remote control adds some complexity. I think the biggest hurdle is support for all the HDMI audio codecs (DTS,DTS-HD,DTS-HD MA,DD,DD TrueHD,DD Plus, and all the other theater varieties in addition to PCM and DSD)."

I have some FETs that are hard to come by and it would be great to have the time to do it. The issues I'm afraid of when conceptualizing are impedance, oscillations and power supply. There are some serious gaps in my knowledge for electronics, enough so that I have still not attempted it. Power is easy for a preamp, but clean power doesn't come cheap for something bigger like a receiver. I agree with the other comments here, receivers are done so well cheaply by so many people, getting an amp board (even a <$10 5w amp or something) and a nice fet or tube preamp would be easiest. Then you can have a custom case and you only have to worry about power and switching, which on its own isn't too bad to deal with. If you can etch your own PCB you can have all that done in a snap with a few switches and voltage regulators."

The result is OUTSTANDING! It fixes so many issues with the headphones and puts them in the same class as the 600s. I have the picture of them side by side to prove it. I've been doing A/B tests for an hour and they sound very similar. It fixed the lack of bass on the 595s and made the highs sparkle a bit, but not too much. It's just right! They are more forward, in your face than the 600's with a slightly smaller sound stage. Detail improved. Mid range improved. I was so impressed I just ordered new ear pads. I am curious if the original pads degrade the sound, being over 5 years old and washed multiple times. Over my many modding adventures, changing pads is a surefire way to alter the sound signature. I am seriously considering getting hold of Tyll and sending these in for evaluation! I'll post a ton of details if there's interest.

diyaudio,2ucig3,Adamiciski,3,Sat Jan 31 23:40:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting!  I would like to build something similar, and have a few questions for you as kind of a tube noob:   Would you mind posting a picture (or a few!) of the guts? In the schematics, I don't see any connection to the heater of the 12AX7, which I believe is pin 9, 12 volts.  Do schematics like this assume a person knows this and will apply the heater voltage, and does your transformer have a 12 volt tap, or does this circuit not need that for some reason? I would like to also add a line level input with a switch between inputs, so I could warm up a line level signal.  Do you (or anyone reading this) know the easiest way to add this in?  Would I want to ""pad"" the input somehow? On the funwithtubes site, I don't see mentioned anything regarding expected current draw on the transformer.  Have you done any tests for what kind of draw is expected from the circuit? I am a beginner with tube gear, but it seems like that would be an important factor in picking a transformer. How does it sound!? Do you notice any difference compared to a SS amp?   Thanks for any time you have to answer these, and thanks for posting!"
diyaudio,2ucig3,roustabout,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:32:58 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Sorry, I didn't realize the photo was so bad since I posted all of this on mobile.  I will try to get some better ones up soon.    1.) The guts aren't pretty, but I can do that.(promise not to ridicule cable management too bad!)    2.) I used the 6.3V output from the secondary output coil of the transformer.  This is reccomended here (along with the rest of the power supply circuit: funwithtubes.com -> A Basic Power Supply: Found in the Newcomb D10.  I don't know why there isn't a direct link for this.  My specific transformer had 4A to the heaters.    3.) I'm not sure about this.  I would need to read quite a bit more, but I'm afraid that if you just set the switch at the beginning of the circuit it would further amplify your line level signals.  Can anyone else comment on this?  I would also be curious about how this works.   4.) The transformer does not require substantial power from the wall.  If you're worried about the circuit's needs, then you need to focus on the amperage going to the heaters less than the preamp circuit.  On the 6.3V winding, Max states that 2A is okay, 3A is better.  I went with 4A, because I had 3 tubes and I figured what's the $5?  I figured it might glow brighter or heat up faster, not really sure though.    5.)  It sounds Awesome!  There is definitely a warmer sound, possibly rolloff at the top end?  To me with my nerve Audio preamp, it was a little bright, not bad but enough to cause fatigue during extended listening.  I listened to this new one for about 4 hours last night and had no inclination to stop except for the UK game(proud alum) and again at midnight.  Ziggy Stardust, Highway 61 Revisited, Everything will be Alright in the End, Satchmo, the list goes on, but everything just sounded smoother to me.

I just looked at the 12ax7 info, didn't realize the center tap for the heater could use 6 volts, that's great. Regarding the line level input, yeah, I'd definitely need to reduce the gain and also bypass the riaa correction, will probably just need to do a separate circuit for that channel. Thanks again!"

diyaudio,2u5y2w,GeckoDeLimon,3,Fri Jan 30 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"The math doesn't work like that. The woofer does the vast majority of the work in any given speaker. In reality, a tweeter rarely sees more than a few watts.   That being said, bigger is almost always better with amplifiers. They're like...the engine in a car. I normally dislike car analogies because they never work, but this one sorta does.   If the car can get up to the speed it needs to reach, then it has a big enough of an engine. Want to go fast (ie, go loud)? Get a bigger engine. In fact, it's often useful to have lots of power in reserve, just in case. I mean, you can still use it to get groceries and cruise the mall parking lot, right? In the same way, you don't have to always run an amplifier at full blast.   Now, some cars are very small, and are not designed for Autobahn speeds (12"" wheels, awkward aerodynamics, improper suspension, etc). You could put a more powerful engine in them, but using all that power would be unwise. Similarly, the OS is a small speaker, not designed to be blasted. It can be connected to a VERY large amp and it'll work. Turn it up too much, and there'll be damage. But that's fine; they're still respectable for the range in which they are intended to operate.   So the question becomes, how big of an engine is enough for your needs? And does it fit your car?   Back to speakers, the OS is pretty small, and the difference between a 15W amp and a 30W amp is only +3dB in max output. The Lepai will get loud enough that you have to raise your voice to be heard by the person sitting next to you. Not quite a shout, but close.   There are certainly larger amps that will work with them quite well, at whatever price your budget allows. You may decide to go with a 100WPC receiver or something like that, and it's not a bad idea as a way of future-proofing.  But would the Lepai suit your needs? Almost certainly, and at a price that cannot be improved upon."

diyaudio,2u5y2w,apexian,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'm running a SoundBlasterZ pci card into a Topping TP20 into a pair of Micca MB42X. Planning to upgrade to the OS. The soundblasterZ pre-amps the signal and makes for some seriously loud noise, much higher than the amp alone. Is there a way to quantify the effect of pre-amp and amp to calculate total sound level?"
diyaudio,2u5y2w,autowikibot,2,Sun Feb 1 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"Well, the word preamplifier is something of a misnomer.   A preamplifier actually does very little signal amplification. In the case of your sound card, its primary function is to convert digital signals to analog, then increase the analog signal to the expected range (line level, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level).   It's also the preamplifier which applies other modifications to this line level signal - such as attenuation (volume control), L/R balance adjustments, tone control, etc. The preamplifier can also typically route (switch) several different signals (radio tuner, CD player, turntable, etc.) to the power amplifier. For these reasons, preamplifiers have sometimes been referred to as control amplifiers.  Technically, your Topping TP20 is an ""integrated"" amplifier, meaning that it combines preamplifier and power amplifier functionality. It takes a line-level signal from a source device and amplifies it to speaker level (about 14 watts RMS), but also includes a volume control knob - which is the preamplifier-like aspect of its functionality.  So bottom line, even though it seems counter-intuitive, a preamplifier doesn't function to make the sound level coming out of your speakers even louder. But what it does do is control and prepare the source signal so it can be efficiently amplified to a speaker level signal by the power amplifier.  The strength of the speaker-level signal (measured in watts) is just one variable which influences the sound pressure level produced by your speakers. The efficiency of the speakers themselves has a huge impact, and to a certain extent, the environment they are playing in has an effect on the perception of loudness. So there's no way to quantify the total sound level (SPL) without taking all of these factors into account.  Hope this helps..."
diyaudio,2u5y2w,Armsc,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:13:40 2015 UTC,"Line level:       Line level is the specified strength of an audio signal used to transmit analog sound between audio components such as CD and DVD players, television sets, audio amplifiers, and mixing consoles.  As opposed to line level, there are weaker audio signals, such as those from microphones and instrument pickups, and stronger signals, such as those used to drive headphones and loudspeakers. The ""strength"" of these various signals does not necessarily refer to the output voltage of the source device; it also depends on its output impedance and output power capability.

diyaudio,2u2htd,FowlyTheOne,2,Thu Jan 29 12:36:53 2015 UTC,"Depends, if it is a car amp, most of them are one way. But you can leave the midrange speakers running full down range, they will get quieter the lower they play. Add the sub with lowpass and you got a good start.  Upgrade would then be to insert highpass filter for midrange (i would guess sub -100 mid 100-2k5 high 2k5-20k since you mentioned this frequency)  Just so I get this right, you want to add a sub to your current setup? Not replace the midrange with the subwoofer?"
diyaudio,2u2htd,meezun,2,Thu Jan 29 12:45:16 2015 UTC,"That makes sense to me. well, in fact. If possible i could replace one or two midrange (and tweeters if i go with one way filters?) for one or two subwoofers."

What is the specific amplifier that you are using?  The power of the amp will depend on the efficiency of the speakers and how loud you need it to be. The power rating of the speakers is the maximum power they can handle, usually that's not relevant unless you are trying to drive way too much power into them."

Old ATX power supplies are a good source of wire.  5: I think the main reason of keeping the mains earth connection separate is to minimize the risk of it coming loose due to stress from the other wires.

You might get a momentary short when you first make the connection but whatever bulk capacitance is connected should begin to charge up and you should see the readout change on the meter (resistance should continually increase, or voltage in diode check mode will increase).

To do star grounding do I need to connect all the grounds from the amp circuit to this point, or do I need to create a second point on the chassis to keep the earth and grounds separate?   I would keep them seperate, just to be very sure that the chassis earth is secure. Use a ring lug, double nuts, and a lock washer. If your enclosure has multiple metal parts, the best practise is to wire another earth to each part.  I'm not sure of the legalities, but technically, yes you can use the one post.

diyaudio,2tmarg,heshl,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"I've used mostly all Yuanjing boards and I've been very satisfied. I've had some die but I've also taken chances with them because the 128watt boards are so cheap and versatile.   I've bought about six or seven of these.   http://www.ebay.com/itm/2-x-68W-Watt-LM3886-NE5532-Audio-Amplifier-Board-/121247643728?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c3aec3850  Formerly, my 15"" dual voice coil 4 Ohm subwoofer was running off of one of those and it was not too bad. It definitely had its limits on tracks with deep bass but it was surprisingly decent.   Those boards are easier than the kits I used in Lil' Red because the power rails are built in. You just get a 24V-0V-24V 6A transformer and plug it directly into the board with spring mounted screw clips. It's hardly even a kit. It's basically all there. All you add is the transformer and the heat sink. So if you're just getting started I absolutely recommend those.   Indeed, I will be putting one together for someone's birthday in a few months and I'll post pics of that but it's so easy it's almost unnecessary. There is no soldering and hardly any wiring. But I would be happy to put up pics of how to make one with an RCA input board and a Volume pot like I put on Lil' Red. That's a little bit of customization but still quite trivial. Those things are unnecessary though because you can just control the volume from your digital player and wire the RCA leads straight to the board with a screwdriver."
diyaudio,2tmarg,kevin402can,1 point,Mon Jan 26 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"So just sink the transistors, power it up and you're good?"
diyaudio,2tmarg,leica_boss,1 point,Mon Jan 26 10:41:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's it. You can add more stuff if you like but it's not necessary. For example you can put a volume potentiometer and RCA input jacks but you absolutely do not need them.   There are screw terminals for the transformer, L,R in and speaker outputs. So what I did when I first got started was just cut one piece of RCA dual female cord in half and strip the ends. The outside layer is ground and you put that to the ground input terminal and the inside wire is positive input so you strip the end of it and put that into the signal in then repeat for the other channel. You can just wire them in with a screwdriver directly like that and it's fine.   You need one regular sized phillips and one mini or jewelers type phillips screwdriver and you're good. No soldering and very few things to put in backwards. And even if you do you're probably going to be okay. They're fairly tough. Obviously,  you should get the polarity right anyway but that's the biggest challenge so it's not too tough.   You may also want a drill to put screw holes in the heat sink. If that's too much to ask you can always just cinch it on with a piece of wire but it's nice to add a bit of thermal grease although I confess I've gone without it and not had problems.   Slot I PIII CPU coolers are ideal.   And finally, do add the fan. A fan makes all kinds of difference. You can hear how much more power you get with and without a fan. It really makes a big difference. With nice cooling you definitely get better power."

diyaudio,2tmarg,leica_boss,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"I've never used a switch mode power supply for audio. I believe it's easier and cheaper to get what is called a ""center tap"" transformer. It's just a transformer with three wires coming out of it. For an lm3886 a safe bet is 24V-0V-24V at 5Amps or more.   However, I've also never bought the transformers on-line and now that I went and tried to find one for you I realize it's not as easy as I thought. I didn't realize I might be getting lucky by having a local source of these huge transformers. They are quite large and heavy so shipping could be an issue. There is a shop in Taipei where I can get them for about twenty bucks US.  But finding them on-line does not seem so simple. I might go to the shop where I get them and ask directly. The staff is extremely helpful. They actually sit down with customers and design simple circuits and teach techniques to customers it's a really cool place.   But getting back to your question that switch mode board you link to seems like it would be fine. The key is that it has +25 and -25 and ground obviously. So that would give you approximately the right voltage to power that lm3886 based board. It has input screw connectors that read 26-0-26. In this case it won't matter which side is positive and which is negative. The reason for that is because that particular board has a bridge inverter and smoothing cap built in. Running DC into it won't be a problem it will just be redundant and my understanding is that should not be a problem. You will lose a volt or so by running through the on-board bridge but no big deal.   But I've never done it that way so I'm just assuming. I tend to make assumptions and try things such as when I was doing the power rails on this Little Red I was blowing up expensive capacitors. I tend to just go for it and see what happens. I hate to have you fry your setup. I've done it more than once.   But I think you'd be okay with that.   Just to clarify, transformers are always AC devices. They don't have positive or negative  sides. So those boards seem to be made with transformers in mind because they have DC inverters on them which consist of a bridge diode and and smoothing capacitors. So when you run AC into DC through such an inverter you multiply your input voltage times the square root of 2 which is 1.414. . . then you subtract about 1.4V for the losses caused by the bridge itself.   In the case of running DC through the bridge inverter, my understanding is that you won't get the V*(sqrt2) part. You just get the 1.4V loss (roughly) that comes from running through the bridge. You also won't have to worry about polarity. It should be fine and keep in mind that those chips can handle quite a bit of range in voltage anyway. It's okay to be up or down by say five volts. I've run them off of AC 32-0-32 which is way high and had things work out. Others have said they have used 12-0-12 so there's a huge range and you're right in the sweet spot with that board so it ought to be fine.    But I'm still going to try and find a center tapped transformer on-line. I'm surprised how hard they are to find. However, I concede they're damn heavy so that might be the issue."
diyaudio,2tmarg,leica_boss,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:39:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, now I'm confused about center-tap transformers and DC power supplies.  I've used pre-built ebay DC rectifier boards to go between transformers and chip amps.  Something like this: http://i.imgur.com/y4VjSsm.jpg  I've usually used 12v-0v-12v transformers (24v when measuring ends together) into said rectifier boards, the result is +/- 35v with a center ground. I've also done it with 24v-0v transformers by connecting to each AC terminal and not connecting the center tap on the transformer end of the rectifier board.  Have I been under powering these amplifiers (were they expecting 70v when they ask for +35/GND/-35?), or am I doing it right using 12v-0v-12v transformers?  I'm confused because OP is using a 24v-0v-24v transformer and ending up with what appears to be 35v DC, from what I suspect is 48v AC.  EDIT: I see you're supposed to measure from the center ground on the DC side, and my supplies are providing +17v/-17v, and should be providing +35v/-35v."
diyaudio,2tmarg,Prostar14,3,Sun Jan 25 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"When you rectify the AC, you should get in the neighborhood of 1.414*Vac when unloaded. In your example with a 12-0-12 VAC transformer, the result should be right at +/- 17VDC if you're trying to create bi-polar rails (measured relative to center tap/ground), or if you just need a single rail, 34VDC (measured across pos/neg output).  It sounds like you're only feeding +/-17VDC to your amp. And under load, the voltage will be even lower than that, so your amp is probably clipping at a relatively low wattage."
diyaudio,2tmarg,rainwulf,1 point,Sun Jan 25 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"Ahh, thank you. That clears it up. It appears I wasn't correctly measuring or understanding the specifications for bi-polar rail power supplies. I take it it's common to measure off of the center rail. My simple understanding was to measure from +/-, making me think they wanted 35v total, not 35v in each direction from 0v. I'm going to try re-wiring one of my amps soon."
diyaudio,2tmarg,rainwulf,2,Sun Jan 25 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"I think you are under powering them quite a bit if you're going with 12-0-12.    I'm getting 35+ and 35-. So. yeah 70v total and it runs nice and cool. No problem. Even running hard to the point where the overload protection cuts in they don't get hot. I cranked it up when the next door neighbors were gone and it's loud enough that standing out in the street people walking by were giving me sideways glances because of the decibels coming out of the house. But it didn't warm up much. It's quite stable.   I also run plenty of those smaller 128watt kits on 24V-0V-24V.   In fact, I ran one for years on 32V-0V-32V which is far too much. Should be around 44V rectified and smoothed so well over 80V but it was good for years.  It did finally die a few months ago. After it died I immediately fried a fresh 128 watt lm3886 board and realized that I was just getting lucky with that much voltage. At that point I began to get busy on Lil' Red."

I've heard various things on the guitar forums regarding purely resistive loads, and with how cheap they are, I suggest just picking up a Weber Mass.

Hard: Build your own. If you're intending to run off wall power, class AB amps will give you good performance. You could also go tube, but that's a hipster call and things will get more expensive.

If you are using an FR2/4 board you will be able to see the light clearly where you gave etched the copper away correctly.  Unless you are etching this for surface mount I would err on the side of caution and etch for 'too long'.  Often my board will look great but there are some tiny copper bridges left that I need to scrape away.  If you continue to have issues I can mill the board for you if it's single sided or you could send the design to someone like ragworm.eu or oshpark?  Good luck! Pictures would help too"""
diyaudio,2t4hpt,TomAskew,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:21:29 2015 UTC,The board was actually black (excluding the traces) after etching it for over an hour.  I have been considering getting it milled/fabricated for me but the options are expensive and somewhat more limited here in Australia
diyaudio,2t4hpt,TomAskew,1 point,Wed Jan 21 11:39:36 2015 UTC,Ah I understand about the expense! OSHpark are cheap but slow - check them out of you haven't already - you may be surprised.  I can mill this for you if you are having no luck etching it - it will probably be more expensive in P+P than the work. I'm not trying to make money just trying to help you out.  Do you have a picture of your etched board? You may find that warming the liquid up speeds up the process by quite some time.  Cheers!
diyaudio,2t4s1i,spraycanhead,2,Wed Jan 21 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"unless you can go through and check everything, you probably want to gut it and start with new internals. i would leave the turntable and receiver...just there for decoration.  there are a few decent bluetooth amplifiers that may work. speakers are easy to replace."
diyaudio,2t4s1i,MasterBettyFTW,1 point,Wed Jan 21 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have specified, I would like to keep the turntable in working condition as well. Would that be conceivable?  I will look into bluetooth amplifiers though, thanks!"
diyaudio,2t4s1i,MasterBettyFTW,2,Wed Jan 21 15:03:14 2015 UTC,"conceivable, yes. i hope you are good with an oscilloscope and multimeter  practical for good quality output and not destroy records, unlikely  replace turntable with modern gear, get a decent phono preamp and wire that all into the bluetooth amplifier.  some problems will occur with vibrations from the speakers mounted in the same cabinet structure. you will want to isolate the turntable as much as possible."
diyaudio,2t4s1i,MasterBettyFTW,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:27:24 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why would a new turntable be better suited than the original one? Are they built to different specifications or something?"
diyaudio,2t4s1i,ha1156w,4,Wed Jan 21 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"Better platter material, better motor, magnitudes better internal electronics. Newer stylus won't destroy records as fast. Replacement parts, easy upgrades......."
diyaudio,2t4s1i,classicsat,2,Wed Jan 21 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"The stresses that the tonearm put on the grooves of the record will be significantly and noticeably different, to the positive, with an appropriate turntable.  This changer is rim-driven so you'll get less rumble from a belt- or direct-drive platter. You won't hear the hum and vibration of the motor coming through your speakers, either.  The speed will be much more accurate.  There's a huge list of improvements a newer turntable would bring, record life and extraction of detail being one of the biggest.  In the era this changer was built, they viewed records as something disposable that could be replaced on a whim.  It was expected that records would wear out in a few plays.  We know this not to be the case today.  They also considered smoking healthy in that day too.  Ditch the ceramic cartridge in this and install something with a modern magnetic cartridge and a preamp.  The magnetic cartridge is light years ahead of the ceramic in bringing out the details and nuances that live in the grooves of your records.  Things like the breathyness of the singer.  The sound of the audience for live performances.  You'll easily hear Paul McCartney saying ""bloody hell!"" in Hey Jude when he hits a wrong note on the piano."
diyaudio,2t4s1i,midorikawa,2,Fri Feb 6 08:30:41 2015 UTC,"While probably not exactly a matched set, I would go all or none, as in restore it to original electronics, speakers, and turntable, or strip it all for modern.   You can likely add an aux in if it hasn't one, which will be pretty easy if it has a main power transformer."
diyaudio,2t4s1i,ha1156w,2,Thu Jan 22 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"This thing would actually sound pretty good with a recap.  In the photos in RadioMuseum, look at the photos of the underside.  You see all those waxy cylinders?  Those are your targets.  Remove and replace with modern components.  One last target, the big metal cylinder sticking out the side.  That's a multi-section electrolytic, and should be replaced with modern equivalents.  You should also be able to rig up the input selector to switch between iPod and record player.  Word of caution on this Philco record player - it's a fairly heavy tonearm design.  I wouldn't run any newer records on it.  This actually looks very much like a Voice of Music player, in fact, 1210 series maybe.  I had one, and while it sounded superb, I would never run more than 78s on it."
diyaudio,2t4alc,fivechickens,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:20:22 2015 UTC,"Replacing a jack or two would not be too expensive, just a soldering iron and two jacks, you can find them for less than $2 each on digikey or mouser or where ever you shop.   As for how they compare to Overnight Sensations? Worst I would guess. What little info I can find on them says either 65 or 80 dB S/N ratio, 3 inch full range and 3/4 inch plastic cone tweeter speakers. They are just too outdated to compare to more modern designs. I would recommend a subwoofer to go along with the Overnight Sensations if you are worried about the impact."
diyaudio,2t1pyd,Firebreathingwhore,3,Tue Jan 20 13:16:52 2015 UTC,"Ported enclosures are not ideal, but they will work just fine.   The reason sealed cabinets are preferred is because they work better with the receiver's highpass/lowpass filters for the subwoofer integration. For Yamaha, Kenwood, Pioneer & Onkyo (the only ones I've been able to confirm), the two filters are asymmetrical. The satellite's highpass is 2nd order and the subwoofer's lowpass is 4th order. The natural 2nd order sealed-box roll off cascades with the 2nd order highpass for a 4th order acoustic transfer function, matching the subwoofer nicely. All THX-specified receivers also behave this way.  Ported boxes are a little harder to set up, but can still be done. Ported boxes play lower...and then drop like a rock. It causes more overlap between the sub & sats in the crossover region. In order to emulate this same sort of roll-off, you may need to also use the crossover knob on the subwoofer's amplifier to lean out the sound if there's a ""tubbiness"" from too much overlap. Normally it's left set to the max, but here...you may need the additional 12dB/oct roll off to match your mains.   Also, consider under-voluming the cabinet by about 15% and choose a tuning that's maybe a half octave lower than Fostex specifies. This will give a roll-off that emulates a sealed enclosure with a gradual roll-off on the bottom, but still has more extension like a ported box (and still ultimately rolls off on the bottom end like a sealed ported box). It also lowers group delay--avoiding that ""ported sound."" Also, for those woofers, I would not select lower than 120hz for the crossover point. Just not enough Xmax to push it lower."
diyaudio,2t1pyd,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Tue Jan 20 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks fit the info. I run a Yamaha RX-V 1067 No sub, I use Fostex Fe206eN in their own design back loaded horns.  I'll see where it gets me one the satellites are finished."
diyaudio,2t1pyd,MasterBettyFTW,2,Wed Jan 21 13:15:23 2015 UTC,"If your receiver has a high pass crossover function, use it.   Movies usually have tons of very low frequency signals. If you try to reproduce below the tuning frequency of the cabinet they might have a bad time.   Why use them in the bedroom?"

Check out used stuff in general; professional grade equipment probably won't be as abused as lower grade stuff. It's been a while since I've been into recording gear, but I'm guessing 300 is probably not outrageous for a mid-range professional boom mic.  I would just look into getting some (used) SM57's or SM58's to use until you're serious about dumping some money into more purpose-built mics. They're not particularly great at anything, but they're industry standard workhorses that are good enough for most applications and will have ""familiar"" sound characteristics."

diyaudio,2sxbt4,kevin402can,6,Mon Jan 19 11:01:59 2015 UTC,"It could be pretty bad, I wouldn't pay anything more than nothing for them. Depending on what they are, response may trickle off as high as 100hz. Also, you'll be throwing lots of watts at it, and since there is no power handling number, you will always be in danger of burning up the voice coil, and possibly hurting your amp. Even the most basic speakers from bottom-of-the-line companies stamp their drivers with something. A blank driver is not going to be good.  If you're in the US, $20 can get you a very basic subwoofer driver, with all of the T/S parameters and returns if you aren't satisfied. Here's one: http://www.parts-express.com/grs-12sw-4-12-poly-cone-subwoofer-4-ohm--292-484  If you're building the box, tailoring it to a driver that you will almost immediately grow out of is a waste of time and money. If you want cheap and easy, get a 10"" (or possibly 12"" if it fits) subwoofer and mount it in a 12"" sonotube. You'll have to make the end-caps out of MDF, but that is the cheapest box possible, and may sound decent."

diyaudio,2svyrb,fiftysheds,2,Mon Jan 19 01:33:21 2015 UTC,"Very unlikely. What amp are you using? Be very careful diagnosing your amp as the voltages are likely lethal if not careful.

diyaudio,2svyrb,jtn19120,2,Mon Jan 19 02:02:02 2015 UTC,"My first bet would be the power tubes went bad if it's not a speaker connection issue. Those wear out first and tend to be changed almost regularly.When you turn it on there isn't any noise to suggest it's on?  See if the power tubes glow or show defects. Replace them or take it to an amp tech. Od and boost pedals should not hurt a well made amp...even the ""super hard on"" pushes an amp harder but should not hurt it.   Edit: looks like it's a hybrid amp which means the power amp is solid state. Maybe the preamp tube? http://www.shortscale.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1111332&sid=2d19cc1da2a4c0ef11b39b9431580d9c"

diyaudio,2svyrb,AudioMan612,5,Mon Jan 19 05:02:56 2015 UTC,Just because the tube glows doesn't mean it still works.  Get a tube tester or a new preamp tube (i'm assuming its a 12AX7) should only set you back about $15
diyaudio,2svyrb,compost,2,Mon Jan 19 05:26:50 2015 UTC,"s AC coupled. It's a good idea to AC couple the output of your pedals too, just put a capacitor in series with the output.   I don't see how this would be your problem, but it's worth mentioning just in case.  If the output transformer goes bad on a tube amp (as in it shorts out), you'll usually have similar behavior.  The most common cause of this (that I know of) is running a tube amp without a load (a speaker or some kind of resistor in its place for testing purposes).  Unless at low volume, this can easily fry an output transformer pretty quickly, especially when sounds like pops (plugging in a cable) get amplified.  Oh, and just to idiot test, you made sure that your cable, guitar output jack, and input jack are working alright?  A good cable can pretty much last forever (as long as it's not abused too heavily and wound properly when stored), but jacks will always eventually wear out."
diyaudio,2svyrb,compost,2,Mon Jan 19 12:03:03 2015 UTC,"What kind of amp? Was the gain turned up? A dc offset could definitely cause a component to overheat and fail, but usually the input of an amp is AC coupled. It's a good idea to AC couple the output of your pedals too, just put a capacitor in series with the output.  If you feel comfortable with the project you might open it up and probe around with the oscilloscope, looking for where the signal becomes attenuated or clipped and distorted. Just remember that there is voltage in there that can kill you. Especially if it is a tube amp. In which case you might be better off taking it to a professional."
