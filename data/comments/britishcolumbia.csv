When they arrived it was an old couple with nothing to hide... They invited the fuzz in and they found a massive fat indica plant in the back yard. The lady trimmed it for years and it became a monster.  She told them she just thought it was pretty and was there when she bought the house. I think they did not charge her.

britishcolumbia,3e2gh2,michaelm8,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:55:47 2015 UTC,"For years, I've been saying that an effective measure in winning the legalization battle was for smokers to just start planting their seeds everywhere; traffic circles, parks, public garden boxes etc. And don't just do it once, make this an ongoing problem. The City councils would have to decide what to do; eat the cost of having groundsmen removing plants all over the city in random spots for years to come, as well as draft up laws that fine/jail people who plant seeds, or, you know, let nature be nature and let harmless plants grow."

britishcolumbia,3e20k4,AdiposeFin,3,Tue Jul 21 19:52:18 2015 UTC,So this contraption is going to use how much electricity to do this?
britishcolumbia,3e20k4,strangerunknown,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"Most of the electricity would go into the creation of hydrogen gas. You get less energy out of hydrogen gas than you do just using the energy needed to create the hydrogen gas. However, hydrogen gas is a byproduct of oil refining process, so this could be used on facility to produce slightly more hydrocarbons.   Unfortunately, the only process I'm aware of for turning CO2 and H2 into fuel creates methane which is too inefficient/non-economical to transport off the refinery. The methane that is already created in the oil refining process is generally used onsite to heat the facility, where it is released back in the atmosphere as CO2.   I'm glad to see people researching stuff like this, but it's seems like a really inefficient method to make fuel that is only really good for immediate consumption in the form of heat."
britishcolumbia,3e20k4,MonstersInTheCloset,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:26 2015 UTC,Carbon dioxide scrubbers have existed before this. What makes this one so game changing? Is it just the size?
britishcolumbia,3e20k4,MacThule,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:17 2015 UTC,I think the fact that it's not actually a CO2 scrubber as much as a fuel production plant.
britishcolumbia,3e20k4,MacThule,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"Doing this on a commercial scale has been a long time coming - turning solar/wind power into solid fuel.  Reducing atmospheric CO2 content is a nice side effect, but more for show than any long-term environmental effect since all the CO2 removed is going into a commercial fuel product that the producers want to sell. So it'll quickly be released back into the atmosphere, it's only being removed temporarily.  It would reduce the amount of new carbon-based fuels we need to pull out of the ground though, so it's got potential to be an overall win."

britishcolumbia,3e0z7w,Canwerevolt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:58:22 2015 UTC,"Similar climate to porpoise bay. Theyre only aprx 10km apart. The Tet has some pretty spectacular views of the inlet. However it is not the same kind of camping as porpoise bay, you have to hike in. There are cabins (that i have not been to) but youd still have to bring a fair amount of gear to be comfortable. Also this is a fairly steep region. The park mostly on the side of a mountain rising directly out of sechelt inlet. Id imagine light pollution would be pretty low considering how remote the area is in relation to sechelt, but dont rely on my word for that one. You can see a portion of the park from downtown sechelt just to give you an idea of how present light might be."

britishcolumbia,3dzl5j,zymase,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:40 2015 UTC,"Lots of trade-offs. How about heading out to Crowsnest Pass and checking out the Frank Slide then back out to hwy 22 which is a beautiful wide open valley, Hwy 40 to Kanaskis, then to Banff. But after Banff make sure you take 1A to check out Johnston Canyon."
britishcolumbia,3dzl5j,dcmcderm,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"I'm originally from Calgary, now live in BC so I know all these routes pretty well.    Unless you really want to spend time in Calgary you should skip the TCH between Calgary and Banff - it's basically just a straight 4 lane highway with not much to see until you get to Canmore.  Highway 22 is a nice route but even then you still join up to the TCH around 20 KM west of Calgary then it's the same boring route the rest of the way.  On the other hand it would be the fastest route if you're short on time.  Highway 40 is fantastic... it's been years since I drove it but it's very scenic.  You might encounter snow in September, but if you're destination is Vancouver that's also true of Rogers Pass and the Coquihalla summit.  Highway 93 is also very scenic, plus you'll get to see Fernie, Fairmont, Lake Windermere and lots of other cool stuff like the Frank slide.  You'll miss Banff and September is a great time to see it - still nice weather but lots of the tourists are gone.  Honestly if this your one and only chance I'd suggest not skipping it.  That said, one final option if your final destination is Vancouver is to take Highway 3 the entire way.  It's a bit off the beaten path but there are tons of provincial parks and lakes to check out.  Around Osoyoos (which is the hottest place in Canada) it will still be full on summer and the lake and beaches there are great.  Good luck, I'm jealous because it sounds like a fun trip!"
britishcolumbia,3dzl5j,AdiposeFin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:55:14 2015 UTC,"It will add time, but I would recommend routing through Edmonton to Jasper.  Then take the Ice Fields parkway south to Banff.

Then the Fraser Canyon to Hope, and on to Vancouver."

Victoria and all the surrounding area's area great ( live there myself ) But if you are looking for woodsy. and other places. I would recommend Vancouver Island  for sure. Specifically. Tofino and Ucluelet. They are both small towns along Long Beach lots of camping and day trips go go to. Walking and or small commutes. You can surf. canoe  go for long walks on beach etc.   the Lower Island is great for day trips as well. exploring the inner harbor and all it has to offer.   as for the Affordable part... well the island here is expensive all around... Victoria is the most expensive and the rest all falls in line below that.  Affordable and things to do alone Nanaimo would be the best choice...  it's close enough to Victoria it's only a 90 minute drive. and about 2 hours to Tofino / long beach area.

That part of the province offers unique culture, a young vibrant summer population and outdoor activities abound (lakes, mountains, beaches, hikes paddles, etc. Vancouver Island is definitely also an excellent place for a unique B.C experience, but I really do think the edge goes to the Kootenays.  How will you travelling? Automobile or plane?"
britishcolumbia,3dn6rt,mangletron,2,Sat Jul 18 01:59:27 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be for the North Shore--North and West Vancouver. Lots of great parks (Lighthouse, Seymour, Hollyburn, Capilano, Lynn Canyon, etc.) for hiking (or mountain biking if you're into that or want to try it), plus plenty of great restaurants, especially at the south end of Lonsdale Ave. in North Van. around (and in) the Quay.   Alternatively, try Victoria and its surroundings. You can spend a whole day just walking along the Dallas Road cliffs and Beacon Hill park, then go to Cook St. village for dinner (the pizza at Prima Strada is excellent). There's also public transportation out to places like Swan Lake, Island View Beach, and East Sooke Park, but a vehicle does make things easier.

Take the Inside Passage ferry north to Prince Rupert. If memory serves me, it takes around 16. It's more of a cruise ship over a ferry and provides stunning views start to finish. If you really want to get the wilderness feel, take another ferry from Prince Rupert to Haida Gwaii. My description won't help, Google it and check it out!"

britishcolumbia,3dimbg,kiwican,6,Thu Jul 16 15:59:02 2015 UTC,I feel like people who like the idea of Cascadia are either American or have never been to Washington/Oregon. These places are about as different from B.C as Alberta is.
britishcolumbia,3dimbg,jamez_eh,7,Thu Jul 16 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"Well, consider me the exception to your rule. I'm Canadian, and I've travelled throughout pretty much all of BC & Washington State. Almost every region of Washington state is connected to the exact same region in BC, but they go by different names because the areas are divided by a border:     Gulf Islands (CAN) <-> San Juan Islands (US) Olympic Peninsula (US) <-> Vancouver Island (CAN) (especially Strathcona Park) The Cascade Mountain Range literally runs North-South through BC-Washington-Oregon Okanagan Valley (CAN) <-> Okanogan County (US) Columbia River (flows BC -> Wash -> Oregon)   Those are just some of the most obvious examples that I could come up with off the top of my head."

britishcolumbia,3dimbg,jamez_eh,2,Thu Jul 16 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're largely right concerning the modern, urban population.  But many people that were born and raised here and that were here for a time before the recent booms (maybe 30+ years ago) remember a time when the populations and the everyday lives of people in this area were very similar.  The ""Pacific Northwest"", US and Canada, were basically ignored for the longest time in their respective countries because it was perceived to have nothing special going on, just another place to get some fruit, lumber and fish. So the people were mostly left alone and did more interactions with themselves than the rest of the country. This is the key to the existing, though minor and perhaps waning, solidarity in the area now.  Anyway, now Vancouver is Asian, Seattle is all tech and Portland grasping hard onto a hippie aura. The rural communities have a bit more in common. But so much as changed now that from a modern perspective it's easy to not see many commonalities and to doubt the idea of ""Cascadia""."

britishcolumbia,3ddegh,schafs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:53:48 2015 UTC,"Some of the best spots I have been at, on order from north to south, are the following: 1)Atlin Lake. Towards the south end of the lake are two fee campspots. A few sites are right on the water and face east for unreal sunsets.  2) Stewart. This is hands down my favorite town in BC. The drive in alone is out of this world. I have camped in the town of Stewart which is nice, but if you want the best spot ever make sure you drive past the town to Salmon Glacier. You drive through an Alaskan ghost town (Hyder) on your way to the overlook. People pitch there tents here from time to time, and the view will rock your socks off. There is no border check going into Hyde, but there is one going back into BC, so you'll need your passport.  3) Nass valley. It is north of Terrace and a little off the Hwy. Nisga'a Provincial Park is in a lava bed, and very cool. This spot along with haida gwaii are BC's best kept secret.  I'm on my phone so I can provide pics of the area, but let me know if you want more details and I will be happy to provide them! But in all seriousness, you have to hit at least one of these spots."

My friend is getting married on Aug 1st in Dawson City so I thought I would drive up from Dawson Creek and come back down on 37 but other than right on the road I know of nothing worth stopping for, I plan on staying over night at Kinaskan Lake then going into Stewart but then on to Kitimat but now I might change it up and camp at Salmon Glacier. Thank you and please if you get the chance up load the photos."
britishcolumbia,3ddegh,thfc66,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:19:01 2015 UTC,"Nass Valley: If you are going all the way down South to Kitimat you should take The Nisga'a HWY through the lava fields in Nisga'a provincial park. It will only take you an extra 20 minutes and has 10X the scenery. Not too many people travel the road so it will be peaceful as well. if you have 3 hours (72KM) to spare on this section you should take a scenic drive to the last village in the valley that is called Ginglox. it is one way in one way out. I provided a picture of the drive there and the view from the village. it is a paved road.   Stewart: The weather can be very dicey. It mostly rains in the spring/summer and the road up to salmon glacier can be dense fog. The first time I went it was foggy as hell and I saw nothing. the 2nd time I went it was absolutely stunning. from Stewart it is 40km to the salmon glacier viewpoint on a easy dirt road. You pass a very popular grizzly viewpoint along the way which usually has a lot of overseas tourist (not sure if they are out of hibernation at that time, but if they are then that place is a guarantee to see some grizz.) The viewpoint has clean vault toilets too. the ghost town of Hyder that you pass is very popular with tourists and has a tradition of getting Hyderized which is doing a shot of 150 proof alcohol. good breakfast after a chilly evening by the glacier.  Atlin: it is 2 hours to Atlin from the Alaska HWY, at Jakes Corner.(Consider taking the 40 minute detour of HWY 2 south of Whitehorse to Carcross , then over to the road that leads to Atlin).  The prime free campsoit is called Warm Bay Recreation Site. it is 22km south of Atlin along Warm Bay Road. fantastic views of the sunset. If the small campsite is full you can camp on the stone beach that is 50 yards away.   Ethel Lake: since you are coming from Dawson City, I thoguht i would mentuoin the first best spot heading south. Ethel Lake is a tiny lake which is close to the stewart crossing junction. while it is only 26km from the highway, it takes around 90 minutes to drive because of how rough the road is. I would only do it with a high clearance vehicle. I have a stock jeep patriot, which is more of a city SUV. Because of its location and rough road, not too many people will be there."

Emu are surprisingly soft. Center of Gravity is the last weekend in July in Kelowna. It's a pretty popular music festival. Armstrong Metal Fest is in two days, so probably too short notice haha. There's plenty of great B&B in Vernon, though I think they're probably booked solid for summer by now. If money is not an issue, Durali Villa is something special. Expensive, but special. If you want to stay in Kelowna, if you don't want to camp, you can look at renting one of the condos in the Waterscapes. They run a few units like hotel rooms, so you get a full kitchen and stuff. There's a zipline in Oyama, and I think also in Peachland. If you're still here for the start of September, the IPE is running from the 2nd to the 6th.

Supposedly MLA for Merritt Harry Lali was the one who blocked the completion of what's called the Aspen Cutoff or Kingsvale Cutoff.  It's tricky to find the original sources on the internet for regional news from the early 90s. (Newspaper archives used to be available online through the Vancouver Library website, but no longer if you live outside of Vancouver proper.) The proposal was last revisited and nixed in 2001, it looks like. In 2007 the existing highway between Merritt and Aspen Grove was expanded to four lanes and 100 km/h instead, from two lanes and 90 km/h."

I perused Hansard transcripts from B.C legislature from '87 and '98/'99 as well as very many old newspaper articles. From what I have gathered, the kingsvale cutoff was proposed and the land purchased and surveyed, but due to budget constraints put on hold in '88; it was cheaper to use the 2 lane road already in place from Merritt to Aspen Grove. The cutoff could be revisited at a later date when traffic warranted it. The cutoff made headlines again in the late 90s when it was time to upgrade the highway.

We charge administrative fees for the management of that resource"" she is trying to tell us this - we are NOT selling it. And that is the ONLY way we can protect it.   I understand the defence against the commodification of a natural resource like water (although we already do this with oil, gas, and just about everything else) but this former MLA seems to be tone-deaf to the outrage. If Nestle pays a $2.25 administrative fee per 1,000,000 litres of water that it takes from the Hope aquifer, I think the question most British Columbians may be asking is, why not significantly increase the administrative fee?  Also, while the principle of non-commodification of water is sound, practically speaking, setting a high global price per litre on potable, fresh, deep aquifer water and then working to exclude fresh water from trade agreements to prevent international exploitation might, be the only way to protect it in the longer run, isn't it?  For example, I understand that the real, short-term issue with expecting more money from Nestle in BC is that the company will pull out and Hope will go bust from unemployment. But if the long-term goal is to conserve water for BC, then pricing it at, for example, $100/L would likely reduce demand."

But those studying the issue say the human toll of wildfire needs to be balanced against the reality that vulnerable forests are going to burn either way — especially given the mounting pressures presented by climate change.  “The question becomes, if we’ve got areas where fire can burn, the most responsible thing to do ecologically, fiscally and for long-term health is to let those fires burn,” said Toddi Steelman, executive director of the School of Environment and Sustainability at the University of Saskatchewan.  “If we don’t let them burn, we have to pay that account down the line … the forest will burn eventually.”  – See more at: http://www.timescolonist.com/life/islander/the-case-for-letting-forests-burn-1.1997854#sthash.TiXHcyL2.dpuf"

I remember between 2001-2005 we had some unbearably hot summers, and sure it can be attributed to climate change but weather is a cyclical system.  The global climate is changing, there is no question about that, but it is important to keep in mind that the global climate changed over 2 million years ago when the current ice age began, and the climate changed again over 10k years ago when that ice began to melt.   The glaciers and ice caps that are currently melting are the last vestiges of our current ice age and it strikes me as unsurprising that they are melting more and more rapidly as time goes on.

You look that response up on the internet?, because half of what you're saying makes no sense, and the other half is out by thousands of years.  For example:  The Pleistocene started 2.6 million years ago, so you're out by 600 thousand years.  The Cordilleran ice sheet started retreating about 14kyr (following minor retreats at ~19kyr), so you're now out by almost 50%.  You're getting worse. . .   . . . the carbon cycle is hardly to blame for hot dry weather   This is an entirely meaningless statement.  Whether or not weather trends move from east to west or from west to east has nothing to do with climate change on the west coast.  I'm curious how it is you think that it might be the case that it does, or, for that matter  what role the prevailing winds might play in the ""carbon cycle's"" role in inducing warm temperatures.  The problem is that warmer air temperatures along the coast means that as air cools over the coastal mountains less is precipitated out as rainfall, so we get progressively drier summers as temperatures warm.  This is what happens in California during the summers.  Even though air is coming across the Pacific and should be moisture laden, the air doesn't cool enough over the mountains for there to be the precipitation we normally expect.  Other than being driven by increased atmospheric CO2 (as has been conclusively shown for several decades) the drying has little to do with the carbon cycle proper and more to do with the physics of moisture in the atmosphere, something that is easily shown."

I suppose since the thread was about Vancouver Island I was also approaching it from a local standpoint IE Victoria.  The point I was trying to make obviously wasn't clear enough and that point is that the Earth has never had a stable climate when viewed on a grand scale; it is constantly changing in a cyclical fashion. In fact nearly everything in the Universe as we know it functions as a cycle. Life on Earth has been constantly adapting to the cyclical changes for millions of years, which is why I don't believe fear-mongering associated with climate change is at all necessary.

Carbon dioxide in particular diffuses rapidly in the atmosphere, so regardless of where the carbon dioxide is generated the impacts at a global scale are rapid (with regards to increases in atmospheric concentrations), so whether you're in Victoria or St John's, you get the same effect.  The issue with the 'climate is cyclical' argument is that it holds no water.  Whether or not climate has changed is meaningless when we consider the fact that widespread infrastructure was not present for any of these previous cyclical changes.  We're facing changes that are already causing millions (if not billions) of dollars annually.  The infrastructure is also preventing the natural migrations that species may have been able to use to adapt to climate shifts.  It's also worth pointing out that one of the past events where climate changes were driven by high CO2 saw major shifts in the oceans' pH, which would again be enormously expensive.  It's not a question of fear mongering, it's saying that there will be clear costs associated with climate change, costs we're already seeing, and that early adaptation will result in long term savings.  Whether or not you believe in catastrophism you can at least acknowledge that preparing for costly change is better than facing it unprepared."

My great-grandfather ground wheat to flour with a windmill in Denmark, but now the windmills are taller and provide power to mills that grind the wheat.  Things change, slowly, and over generations.

britishcolumbia,3cws36,uncle_zio,3,Sat Jul 11 17:37:12 2015 UTC,I admit I kinda got sucked in by the hype myself at first.  Being an Alberni native and seeing her in action as I grew up it came naturally.  But after my sister shared this with me I can see why it's actually a bit of a bad idea.  At least we got her on standby for extreme cases in any area that it's ok to use her though.
britishcolumbia,3cws36,beetlez,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"Another fire boss crashed and sank to the bottom of Puntzi lake yesterday, that's the second crash in 6 weeks. Thankfully this pilot escaped with his life.  We are getting rain at Sproat lake and the fire has been contained.  They are still readying the MARS, and I believe the call to use her comes from above a frustrated frontlines fire fighter.  Can you tell me with certainty that if the MARS was sitting on the lake in standby mode that they wouldn't have used her on Saturday?  It was kind of the perfect situation to use it, wasn't it?  Considering the recently lost planes, I'm grateful she's almost ready.  EDIT: Link add here"

More than often those variables make it unfeasible, which is exactly why they have been phased out over the years. The only reason that the Mars is being readied for standby is for the provincial government to satisfy the armchair firefighters (voters).

britishcolumbia,3cws36,beetlez,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"Right, so you couldn't say from a distance, and those of us that have seen the effectiveness of the mars in a similar situation are armchair fire fighters with no idea?   Everyone understands containing and controlling fires, and no one slights the hard work of any fire fighters, the upset is about the fact that it could have been put out on day one, but it took 4 hours for a spotter plane to show up and even more time for machines with retardant or water.  If the bomber is ready to serve these small fires on the island and sunshine coast, so they don't turn into expensive control plans, it makes absolute sense.  Let's break down some daily costs here:  Mars contract: $15,000/day to be on standby, $6,000/hour when flying plus fuel.  The sky crane that was here for 2 days runs at $15,000/hour and the smaller choppers $3-5K/hr  If Chrispy Clark wasn't in bed with Conair, the fire would have been put out for a fraction of the costs to contain it.  Choppers and ground crew wouldn't have been pulled from other fires, and yes, we would have, like we once did, a machine that can be utilized on 113 lakes AND THE OCEAN.  In a coastal province, it almost makes me laugh that the Gov ""Fact sheet"" left out that important bit of info regarding where it can scoop water.  So the latest, they have pulled the bird dog promised in the 30 day contract, essentially rendering Mars unable to attend fires.  This contract wasn't signed to keep voters happy, we have been an NDP riding since 2005, if anything the idea from this fucked up Liberal government was to sign the deal, then not use the plane intentionally so they can pull an ""I told you so"".

They were super gung-ho - so much so that they countermanded an evacuation order when the fire jumped containment. That was probably the most hellish day of my life. One of the managers got control of a tanker truck, and had half a dozen of us with hoses try to hold the fire back on a slope, while two of the company fallers ran a pump down to the creek at the valley bottom. He kept on pushing us further toward the fire. Guys on either side of me got overrun and abandoned their positions, and an open-bed pickup full of men sped down a logging road that was already ablaze on either side. The manager disappeared. The last thing I saw before evac'ing was flames consuming his expensive radio, which he'd left on a log.   We lost the water truck to the fire, and a bunch of equipment. The loggers who'd run down to the creek barely got out as the fire swept up the valley above them.   It was only later that we discovered that the Ministry had ordered an evacuation long before, but the logging company had ignored this and ordered everyone back in.

britishcolumbia,3co2sy,TimMc56,3,Thu Jul 9 12:15:47 2015 UTC,"This is good news.  At the moment we need every resource we have to fight these fires.    As great and iconic as the Martin Mars are, they are old.  I would love to see the Hawaii Mars remain in service, but at some point the Hawaii Mars will have to be retired due to reliability issues and lack of parts.    I would like to see the province buy/lease some Lockheed C-130's that have been converted to water bombers as a long term investment.  These are planes that are mass produced, cheap, there are plenty of spare parts and crews trained to fly/maintain them.  They aren't some special snowflake unique plane built during WW2.    Of course everything costs money, so we'll see how the province does with a limited budget.  I'm no budget analyst or aircraft engineer so maybe I'm wrong."
britishcolumbia,3co2sy,huebort,2,Thu Jul 9 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"They're cool to look at, but they've had their day. I too would like to see the province look into purchasing it's own small fleet. There's so many good options."

I wonder what Harper's plan is for that? Maybe him and his corporate masters see it as more and cheaper labour.

britishcolumbia,3cnj2z,elnormous,0,Thu Jul 9 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"It sucks but the fire ban is province wide and likely won't get lifted until the fall.  I believe those portable propane campfire things are still allowed but you should even double check on that.  Roads and parks are not closed off - I guess if a fire got close to a road they might do that but most of them now are high up in mountains.  Check www.drivebc.ca though.  It tells you in real time if there are any road closures.  The biggest problem right now is the smoke.  I live near Kamloops and it varies by day/hour but sometimes visibility is severely reduced.  I tried to go for a run the other day and had to stop halfway through because I couldn't stop hacking.  Some experts say the rain may knock down some of the smoke, but it's a toss up if the rain will even happen so...  It's going to be HOT - stop at lots of the many beautiful lakes and rivers to cool off.  Even with a bit of a cooldown early next week it's still going to be 30+ most days, at least in-land, maybe slightly cooler on the coast/island but still."

On the Island, if you decide to head up to Long Beach (a big slab of sand), turn left instead at the intersection going to Tofino or Ucluelet. The raw ocean waves that crash on the rocks at Big Beach are worth visiting. Depending on the tides and weather, that place changes continuously. At low tide there are quiet pools to explore, in a storm it rages with the waves making thunderous sounds.  As much as I love Long Beach, I recommend taking the road less traveled."

britishcolumbia,3cilfk,BrownSugarSandwich,0,Wed Jul 8 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"Peaceful Paddle lands Site C opponents on terrorist watch list   Dear Editor,  According to the Toronto Star (March 30, 2015), the Federal government has included the Paddle for the Peace on a terrorist watch list.  And here we thought we weren’t getting any attention.  We are in good company, though.  Also on the list is a physicians’ group opposed to child poverty, Mother Theresa, and a senior’s quilting group from Bugtussle, Saskatchewan.  In an effort to save our government security agencies time, not to mention the Canadian taxpayers a great deal of money, we’d like to present a brief resume of some of the key players on the Paddle for the Peace planning committee.  It is a rogues gallery indeed.  Retired primary school teacher Ruth Ann Darnell is the Chair of the Peace Valley Environment Association.  She has been working to save the Peace Valley from Site C since the 1970s.  Back then, Ruth Ann’s subversive activities were hampered by the fact the Internet was decades away from being created.  After a long day of teaching five year olds to read, she just never had the time or energy to trudge down to the Fort St. John library to research DIY incendiary devices.  After teaching her sixteen year old son to drive, local children’s clothing retailer Danielle Yeoman knew she was one of those rare talents every ISIS recruiting officer dreams of discovering.  She desired to really put her nerves of steel to the test.  But her terrorist career was over before it was started when she learned those torso belts packed with explosives add at least six inches to your waistline.  I mean really, there are limits to what a girl will do to support a violent fanatical cause.  When she was a little girl, Diane Culling dreamed of becoming a pot-smoking tree-spiker fighting to save the rain forests of the Sudan. Unfortunately she found the required cannabis consumption affected her fine motor skills.  She kept hitting her own thumb with the hammer.  In the end, she was forced to limit her mind-numbing activities to sitting through endless BC Hydro consultation meetings.  Local business owner Wendy Crossland’s membership application was regretfully declined when the Al-Qaeda executive realized she never stops smiling and laughing.  They might be a blood-thirsty terrorist organization, but they do have some standards.  And then there’s Tony Atkins.  He was in from the start and in it until his untimely death from cancer a few weeks ago. Educator, tireless community volunteer, virtual saint, and all-round asset to Fort St. John.  He won’t be there in the flesh at this year’s Paddle, but believe me, he will be there in our hearts.  So, that’s just a few members of the notorious PPPC (Paddle for the Peace Planning Committee).  There are others, but they’re like Voldemort – we don’t even say their names out loud.  To our friends at Canada’s spy agencies – I hope this helps.   If you want mug shots and finger-prints please meet us at our rendezvous site on the west side of the Halfway River bridge on Highway 29 on July 11th.  Bring a spare shirt in case you drip pancake syrup.  And don’t forget your life jacket; because, after all, at the Paddle for the Peace we are all about public safety.  Cordially,  Paddle for the Peace Planning Committee"
britishcolumbia,3cilfk,pertanaindustrial,2,Wed Jul 8 19:39:25 2015 UTC,It seems like this writer is making things more extreme sounding then they are. Nowhere in the original article does it say they are suspected terrorists.
britishcolumbia,3cilfk,rrgagne,-2,Wed Jul 8 20:01:16 2015 UTC,Aren't people saying this is going to be used for fracking? I don't know if that's just the way rumour has it or its a fact.

britishcolumbia,3cilfk,Mustard-Tiger,2,Wed Jul 8 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"Again, rigs are already self sufficient.  They operate sometimes hundreds of km from the nearest power line out in the middle of nowhere. The guy who wrote this is an idiot.

If you are not in a commercial campground, you MUST separate your dining and sleeping areas, you MUST secure your food away from your tent, you MUST NOT have any food in your tent.  And even in commercial campgrounds, it’s best to practice safety: bears do come wandering into commercial campgrounds and they will destroy things to access your food.  Storing your food in your car will be fine.  If you’re hiking in, you need to learn how to properly set up a suspended cache, or use a bear canister.  “Bear Attacks: Their Cause and Avoidance” is a good guide.  It’ll also scare the shit out of you.  Which isn’t a bad thing because, in my experience, Europeans are frighteningly clueless about the dangers of wilderness camping.  You’d be smart to bring a first aid kit.  And a compass and map.  And a flashlight.  You can probably leave the sat phone at home.  I strongly recommend you start researching this stuff yourself.  Weather in the mountains can change in a heartbeat, and people die by being unprepared.  When you head out for more than a couple hours hiking, you need appropriate footwear, rain gear, extra layers of fleece, extra food, and simple self-rescue gear.  Canada’s wilderness is fantastic.  It can be the experience of a lifetime.  It can also turn from safe to deadly with extreme rapidity.  Every year, a fair few people end up dead by misadventure.  Don’t be those people."

Lots of critters like to eat the salty leather off your hiking boots.  If you’re around during rutting season, the elk, moose, etc are dangerous.  There are things that sting, including plants.  I suggest you avoid camping alone in the wild this time around.  I think you’re going to find that day-hikes are a fantastic way to see the sights, and that you’ll have more than enough adventure without needing to take on further risks.

I love the island, but jobs can be scarce. The Cowichan Valley is lovely (but I might be biased). So is the Comox Valley, and it's closer to skiing and Tofino (Tofino is great for a vacation but I don't know if I could live there). Victoria is a beautiful city but expensive as far as rent (and jobs can be hard to find). If you like the looks of Victoria though, Langford is very close by and a lot of people commute because rent is less expensive there.  Maybe the Okanagan? Fairly big cities (Kelowna and Vernon) with lots of outdoor activities (skiing, the lakes, etc.). Squamish and Britannia Beach are nice too, close enough to Vancouver that you can go there on a whim (or even commute if you don't mind a bit of a drive). Close to Whistler too, which is an awesome place but quite expensive to live in.  I don't like cold winters so I can't comment on anything more northerly, and proximity to a city would be a must for me.  Don't let me dissuade you from Chilliwack though if it turns out to be the most appealing, it just sounded like you hadn't really considered other places and BC is a big province!"

So, our culture in the states can vary greatly depending on which region you're in, just as it could vary between the states and Canada. I've lived in different states, and hell, even lived in Europe for a couple of months. I feel prepared for the cultural changes, as well as the others. Though, I feel like there may not be as much change in my case compared to the potential mentioned in the thread you linked.  If you have someone moving from California, Texas, Florida, New york, etc... coastal states a distance away from Canada, I totally understand if they end up going through some sort of culture shock.  I've lived all of my life in Minnesota. It seems so similar to Canada in so many ways. Especially when it comes to the stereotypes, like the friendly (yet, more reserved) residents, the love for hockey, the climate... hell, even the accents are pretty damn similar. That doesn't encompass everything, of course. I think it'll be less of a night and day difference as mentioned in the linked post."
britishcolumbia,3cipzi,teddy2kk,2,Wed Jul 8 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"Culture shock from most of the US won't be huge. But the main point of that linked post is: this is a different country, so you can't just move here and expect to stay. You cannot work without a work permit, and you cannot live here for more than a few months without going through proper immigration channels."

britishcolumbia,3cdium,gilbertsmith,7,Wed Jul 8 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"If the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and introduction of carbon taxes ever exceeds corporate tax rates, then they will indeed be paying no net taxes. That is, BC will have to refund the company more than they pay in other taxes.  This is especially concerning because it's quite possible that carbon taxes will accompany more general tax restructuring, such as simultaneously reducing corporate taxes while introducing a carbon tax. This is basically what happened with personal income taxes when BC's existing carbon tax was being phased in. In such a case, LNG would reap all the benefits of a lowered corporate tax, while being immune from the carbon tax hikes meant to replace it."

Young people/all people in the west today use 3-4 times the energy we did when I was young. There are more of us and we consume more of everything. When you add up the energy use of the internet, including the embedded energy, were talking upwards of 13% of electrical generation. All so we can watch cat videos and yell at each other. You are correct though in that there has been great generational irresponsibility and lying starting with the boomers and increasing with each subsequent generation.  We hit diminishing returns in the mid 1970's and have been papering it over with ever increasing debt. We were warned thousands of times of the consequence by some of the most learned people we have ever produced, but they were shouted down and ridiculed by a powerful and delusional propaganda machine and their  econ-O-priests. Most went along, because they wanted the goodies. Infinite economic and material growth on a finite planet? It's a physical impossibility and thinking our ever growing waste stream would not come back to bite us  (7.3 billion and growing) on the ass is the height of magical thinking. Although younger generations anger is legitimate and should be addressed, the root of the problem is that our technological evolution has outstripped our psychological/emotional (still reptilian & hunter gather) evolution by orders of magnitude - were too clever for our own good. ,,,,, Spending some time on this site will explain things in greater detail and clarity than I can, although it's not for the faint of heart or those who think human nature has changed just because we have had abundant energy for a handful of generations. ,,,OVERSHOOT LOOP: Evolution Under The Maximum Power Principle ,,,,,,,  http://www.dieoff.org/"

Chris Alemany’s arguments are, I think, weak.  He talks about relocating the planes inland — but Coulson doesn’t want to do that.  He talks about using the MM at its full capacity for initial attacks — but initial attacks don’t need the MM’s full capacity.  He talks about how much retardant the MM can deliver — but it can only fly for three hours, and then refuelling is a right bugger; the other planes need to land at airstrips to load retardant, but are way easier to refuel.  He doesn’t address the MM’s inability to be used in steep terrain, which is basically most of BC.  He talks about how if the MM engines fail, they can be swapped in a couple hours — except the engines are back at home base, which means hours of flying back to Port Alberni, then back to the fire.  He talks about how the crews have done in-field repairs in a day — but if the MM is involved, that’s a day of a very large fire spreading like (ba-dum) wildfire. He talks about returning the Philippine Mars to service: ain’t gonna happen, it’s been sold to an air museum.  Etc etc.  I love the Martin Mars bombers.  OMG, they are the most impressive airplane ever.  Watching them scoop is amazing.  They are phenomenal airplanes.  And, I’m afraid, their time is over.  If there was a real demand for these aircraft, Australia, California, BC/Alberta/NWT, China, and Russia — all of which have suffered immense wildfires — would be all over those things.

If you work in finance there's a good chance you'll be working downtown Vancouver, M-F, 9-5. There's a commuter train called the West Coast Express that's made for those people. It serves Mission, Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam, and Port Moody and it's faster and more pleasant than driving. The farther you go from Vancouver along those tracks, the cheaper your housing costs will be. (Not sure I'd really recommend Maple Ridge and farther east). The train runs 5 times into town in the morning and 5 times back in the evening.  For other Vancouver suburbs, anything close to a SkyTrain line will work out well, too.  Unless your job requires you to be mobile, don't commute into Vancouver.  Unless you absolutely love urban life and the hustle and bustle of a big city, don't live in Vancouver proper. Something nice will be incredibly expensive, and less fancy places will be expensive and noisy.   If you're looking to buy a home, check realtor.ca for homes in an area you might like. You can get the property taxes at bcassessment.BC.CA.  People love to say its too expensive on the West coast, but everything scales. Yeah, a house costs an arm and a leg but salaries are higher too. If you have marketable skills in a strong industry you don't have to worry too much!"

One bedroom apartments around $700 to $1000 a month.   My advice would be to try to get a job with a large company in a smaller town. Ski resort (example above), mining company, mill, etc. A ski resort would be a really good one though because you'll probably make friends with co-workers which will perhaps make it easier to get into outdoor activities: skiing, mountain biking, kayaking, climbing etc. If you're an indoor person or a real urbanite then Toronto is by far your best opportunity because the pay in so much higher there than metro Vancouver. Then again, moving to Vancouver, getting some entry level accounting job, studying/saving for the fee to get a realtors licence would be...but that's for another post."

Then, a few years ago I accepted a job offer back on the East Coast and noped out in less than two years. Now I'm back in Van.    I was actually surprised by the high cost of living when I moved back to Nova Scotia, especially income tax and food (produce). Vancouver has expensive real estate compared to H̶a̶l̶i̶f̶a̶x̶ most of the goddamn planet, but urban rents are actually comperable. You have to look harder for a good rental in Vancouver. Expect to compete with other potential tenants on attractive spots, and to view some truly awful vacant sub-dwellings that you wouldn't imagine living in. You can find a good one bedroom apartment in Vancouver for ~$1000/month, I've done it half a dozen times, and recently. Vancouver craigslist is excellent. Grocery stores have better selection and prices, restaurants as well (but I do miss Habanero's).  Vancouver's not a booming job market, salaries are often a bit lower than other Canadian cities, but it's nothing like the Maritimes in terms of limited employer selection.   If you're working and paying income tax in NS, you will get a nice return if you move to BC by the last day of December. If you live in NS at that time you'll owe more taxes. https://simpletax.ca/calculator"

BTW, how do you think we have come to get such hot weather and dry trees? What about the dead trees from the pine beetle who's range and numbers have exploded in the last 2 decades? They thrive in a warmer climate. All the predictions are for longer hotter drier summers. Do you require a peer reviewed paper for each and every time a wild fire breaks out or a local temp record is broken? 2014 was the warmest year in the instrument record globally and the first 5 months of 2015  all set global records as well. In the next couple of weeks June's numbers will be tallied and released and I can guarantee you they will set a new record as well. We would need a mini ice age to break out tomorrow and last the rest of the year for 2015 not to set a new record. Simply saying because you personally have not heard a scientist blame the record temps and fires in BC in the last few weeks on climate change, does not mean anything. If your saying it is not the root cause then show us the scientists that says it's not.

britishcolumbia,3bier2,joinourpower,4,Mon Jun 29 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"If the purpose of the solar-panels would be to offset carbon emissions I've got bad news for these students: including the full life-cycle GHG impact of mining, construction, shipping, installation, and decommissioning solar panels are worse than BC's already low carbon hydro power. In a jurisdiction where they'd offset coal or gas this would be a fine idea, but here it's misguided."
britishcolumbia,3bier2,PotentialApathy,2,Mon Jun 29 17:07:09 2015 UTC,"It looks like B.C. Hydro produces GHG emissions at a rate of source   about 10 to 30 tonnes per GWh in recent years   (= 10 - 30 g/kWh) and the average GHG emissions for current tech solar cells are source   about 72 grams of carbon dioxide-equivalent per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated   You are correct.  edit: After perusing the B.C. Hydro source, it gives no indication whether the CO2 emissions account for what is produced during faciity construction. It could be that their number only includes emissions produced directly from energy generation.  I don't vouch for the validity of this source but they state that dams release a tremendous amount of methane from their reservoirs, spillways and turbines. Methane has a much higher warming impact than CO2.  So maybe the students are on to something?"
britishcolumbia,3bier2,Jabernathy,3,Mon Jun 29 19:42:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the methane impacts have been taken into account but like you I'd doubt that source. It would be interesting to read a more comprehensive and neutral account of that impact. It could be that nobody really knows as the methane emissions could be very hard to track. Also, those methane emissions coming from existing hydro are kind of a ""sunk cost"" as they are behind us. It would be more interesting to think about the new emissions coming from things like Site C.   What would be most interesting would be to understand what power the solar cells displace. Do they displace the low-carbon hydro or do they displace the high-carbon gas plants that BC also runs? The latter are used mostly to adjust power supply to meet uneven demand and are not baseload producers. I suspect that solar would not do much to reduce grid fluctuations, so any panels installed would be more like baseload than marginal. In that case they'd definitely be losers.  Also consider that in BC, being relatively high latitude and low annual sunshine, is going to mean that solar panels produce less electricity and therefore have worse lifetime emissions per unit power as a result.   At the end of the day I think what the students are doing is interesting, but perhaps the most interesting lesson for them would be to really crunch the numbers."
britishcolumbia,3bier2,PotentialApathy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"but perhaps the most interesting lesson for them would be to really crunch the numbers.   I agree. That would be a great learning experience.  With regard to the Methane production, it looks like an active area of research and a consensus hasn't been reached. Likely because of the large number of variables involved. The surrounding environment can vary greatly from reservoir to reservoir.  One thing that seems to be constant is that the methane production is not a one-time cost. Reservoirs continuously emit GHGs. Perhaps the solution is something simple; the type of run-off surrounding a reservoir needs to be regulated. Less organics falling into the reservoir means less methane?"
britishcolumbia,3bier2,Jabernathy,2,Mon Jun 29 20:44:03 2015 UTC,You'd also have to take into account that much of what is rotting (and producing methane) in the reservoir would have likely done the same thing somewhere else. Actually tracking the real marginal methane production would be challenging and I suspect highly contentious.
britishcolumbia,3bier2,PotentialApathy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"what is rotting (and producing methane) in the reservoir would have likely done the same thing somewhere else   True. Though, the rate of decay could vary. A tonne of methane emitted over 1 year is going to be a more dramatic than one emitted over 100."
britishcolumbia,3bier2,Jabernathy,2,Tue Jun 30 00:28:45 2015 UTC,"I don't vouch for the validity of this source[3] but they state that dams release a tremendous amount of methane from their reservoirs, spillways and turbines. Methane has a much higher warming impact than CO2.   Here's the thing about that assumption. First, is the methane specifically because of the reservoir created for the dam, or is it just a byproduct of the water that feeds the dam? If the former, well then yes, these dams may have a greater impact than previously believed, however if, more likely, the latter, it's more of misrepresentation. A lot of scientists are looking into both, and there are many theories, but the one thing that researchers looking at this can agree on is that very little is known about the actual cause of the methane other than 'the breakdown of organic substances found in water'."
britishcolumbia,3bier2,masasuka,2,Mon Jun 29 20:22:45 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the reservoirs act as catalysts. Agricultural run-off and other organic substances are broken down by the algae that lives inside. Without the reservoir, the algae wouldn't be there.  Neat stuff. Hopefully the scientists can find a way of storing the water w/o methane production."

I would fish the river with my dad for years without a freshwater license, we would catch a nice fish, clean it out in the river and bring it home and have a meal. Only reason I really bought licenses is to avoid fines."

britishcolumbia,3bj7j2,TheRealMcCoy95,0,Tue Jun 30 03:57:37 2015 UTC,"I think that if you catch a fish and just eat it I don't see how that's poaching.

britishcolumbia,3bj7j2,rayyychul,2,Tue Jun 30 05:15:40 2015 UTC,"Because ""poaching"" means ""to take game, fish, etc. unlawfully."" Your definition is irrelevant."

britishcolumbia,3b824a,trendless,5,Fri Jun 26 18:46:23 2015 UTC,"Possibly if the ""first nations"" wouldn't oppose every thing that comes up ,people would lend a bit more weight to their objections . [A final case, brought by the Blueberry River First Nation of northeast BC, is a wide-ranging challenge based on broken treaty promises which threatens all future development in the region.]  Hydro bought most of that land quite a while ago. The Blueberry is not on the river . Some one will offer the Band(s) more money and all we be forgotten and muddy the water for the rest of the lawsuits .  It is not to say that the way the province is dealing with this is right.I agree that the court should be cleared first of the pertinent cases and causes but ...the frivolous,jump on the band wagon as it were cases ,are turning it into a joke."
britishcolumbia,3b824a,airbiscuit,0,Fri Jun 26 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're getting at. There does need to be some choosing of battles. And I'd certainly like to see all those in opposition sticking to relevant issues so as to protect the root cause. Of course, I don't expect that to happen because there are so many years of situations that haven't been resolved, so every time a situation gets attention, it's used to also point at every other issue that's still outstanding. From what I see re: Site C, a large portion of those objecting are not native. I know many long time BC residents, land owners, farmers, and many people wholly unconnected to the issue or to any native bands that are absolutely disgusted by BC's handling of this situation and with the dam itself -- for thoughtful, salient reasons. So, while I often see non-natives objecting to this kind of thing, it seems that what gets airplay and attention is the objection by the native communities. In some ways, it has made the causes where natives have strong objections into vehicles for change supported by the general, non-native populous, because they're often the only issues where the government will give, the only areas where the people have power. But, the fact remains that the government is heading straight for an economic cliff and could provoke the people to indiscriminately lash out at any development on the future, thus hamstringing BCs own growth and sustainability."

britishcolumbia,3b824a,PM_Poutine,2,Fri Jun 26 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"And the people who could do a really great job will choose to make a lot more money in the private sector instead, thereby leaving only relatively low-quality candidates available to run for public office."
britishcolumbia,3b824a,airbiscuit,2,Sat Jun 27 10:09:36 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the thing! People always argue with me about this, saying that we'll only get low quality people, poor leaders, etc, if we don't incentive with money. But like you say, those who fit the criteria and would respond to this, will always find bigger and better in the private sector -- public can't compete, even now.   Based on the quality of representatives we have now, we're certainly not benefiting from any bang for buck. I'm not sure we could do worse, no matter what sweeping changes were implemented. There's very few, if any, doing a good enough job of representing their constituents' interests that they'd be worth keeping around.

britishcolumbia,3azs9l,mcrackin,5,Thu Jun 25 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"As far as I know LNG is in liquid form because its cooled in the storage tanks on the ship. If a leak happens, the liquid warms and turns into a vapour that isn't really harmful even on a large scale like that."

britishcolumbia,3azs9l,MeesterNoName,8,Thu Jun 25 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"That was my thought. And from what I could see, the ships are very heavily engineered to prevent a detonation explosion.   I'm not sure if they use other fuel sources to power their engines but maybe you could have an issue there. But that's no different than every other freighter in port.

IRP on the spot and I refused to blow. 90 day suspension, car impounded for 30 days, further fines and tickets. Unsuccessfully disputed.  That was a long time ago. I've since gone to university, graduated, and now live in Calgary, Alberta. Never bothered to drive because I've always lived on campus, downtown Vancouver, and now downtown Calgary. Started looking into getting my license back and had to take Alberta's equivalent program. Waiting on RoadSafetyBC to give me permission to obtain an Alberta license now (yes, they can block it).  I don't know...maybe I'm biased, but what a waste of time. But hey, I was kept off the road?"

If we're really mad at him getting 2 years salary we should be asking why it took this investigation 2 years to get us to this point!

Our system considers it worse to punish someone innocent than to absolve someone guilty. If a person is completely absolved of a crime due to a false accusation, is it acceptable to tell them sorry about the last 2 years?  Who hires someone when googling their name brings up all the recent media coverage listing all the unproven accusations and that they're suspended without pay? No good job, certainly.  This officer sure didn't deserve his salary for the last 2 years, but your alternative is basically a guilty-until-proven-innocent system."

You stated that suspension without pay is always appropriate when allegations arise.  I take issue with that on principle.  I also take issue with that in the sense that I think the system can be better designed.  If you have to keep someone who is under suspicion from engaging in sensitive work, then give them busywork.  Make them earn their pay check.  Give them a program where they can get a lesser job somewhere and make some money that way while earning 50% salary.  I feel they should be able to find a job on their own, but people like you say that would not be enough.    Do not put them on paid leave on the public dime, ever.  It is financially irresponsible and it rewards bad behavior.  Because officers who commit real crimes and acts of misconduct do get away with it, and they get a paid vacation to boot"

You could stop somewhere north of Quesnel - Ten Mile Lake is nice, but that will mean a hella long second day. Personally I would look for something between PG and Vanderhoof.

It is important to note that the words speed limit do not appear anywhere in the last sentence. If you are slower, move over.

Inflammatory statements? How so? By sharing peer reviewed science? If you have an alternative explanation to climate change as to why almost every single one of BC's 12,000 glaciers are melting down, please  share it with us. Also, please let us know what BC will do when our hydro dam reservoirs drop below the needed levels to generate electricity (75%). This is already happening in other parts of the world. For example, the levels at lake mead in the US have dropped dramatically and now Hoover cannot produce the same amount of electricity it use to and if this keeps up, and there is every scientific indication that it will, they will no longer be able to produce any. As it is they are already planning to change out the turbines to low volume turbines (guess who is paying for that?) Even that will only go so far as the lake levels continue to drop - band aid. Also what about our neighbors in Washington state ? Most of that state was declared to be in a drought emergency last month and it is creeping north. We even had to release a bunch of extra water for the recently. Have you noticed that forest fire season in  stars earlier every year and there are more fires and of greater intensity? Have listened to any of the many dire waring from thousands of scientists around the world? They are talking mass human die back and some have said it is already too late.

There should be no reason for you to pass if they were doing the speed limit because that would mean you would be speeding....  I wish they would do this in the Lower Mainland. I drive in the HOV lane. Speed limit is 100, I do about 108 to 110. I get cars right on my ass honking, waving, then passing me around on the right because I am going too slow.  Their passing is dangerous. On average people are driving about 120. I wish the police would come out and start ticketing these people and slowing the speed down.  Just crazy that people think they can go 20% higher than the speed limit with impunity especially on a stretch of highway where people think that the best speed to merge is no more than 80 kmh so people in the slow lanes have to pull into the faster lanes."

britishcolumbia,39mt10,trendless,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"It would be hard for you to infer all the specific details, especially since I didn't explain everything exhaustively. I guess I expected some benefit of the doubt. If this is a sensitive issue for you or you're a friend / family member of an officer, I can understand why you adopted a judgmental tone.  Two of the things that I obviously wasn't clear enough about: in keeping with accepted practice and lawful driving activities, I was already in the right lane, since he was hogging the left and I didn't want to be guilty of the same. I did not switch lanes when he slowed. Also, he slammed on his brakes immediately at the speed sign, while I slowed less abruptly. I made no effort to break the law and was keeping with the commonly accepted practice of safely reducing speed on a multilane highway with cars in front and behind who were doing the same. Also of note, it was a ghost truck. Keep in mind that it was hogging / holding up the left lane, which, without application of lights/sirens is just as unlawful for an RCMP officer as for a civilian."
britishcolumbia,39mt10,Doobage,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:02:00 2015 UTC,":) I guess my point was that if he was doing the speed limit and you were behind him you would not need to move into the left hand lane and hence doing what he was doing, though technically against the law, was enforcing the speed limit and making the roads safer.  And yes I had a friend that was killed on the highway by a person who was speeding, and tried to pass on the right.  As a side note concerning slowing down for a speed zone change my friend failed their first driver's test recently because they did not get down to speed by the speed limit sign. They were no more than 2 km/h over the speed limit. The sign was obscured behind a bush. He slammed on his breaks as soon as he saw it but couldn't get to the limit in time... again legally you have to be at the sign's posted limit by the time you hit the sign."

britishcolumbia,392oiw,FauxCapitalist,0,Mon Jun 8 22:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kinda walked right into that one. As for First Nations getting the right to vote in 1960, that was in the context of not losing their treaty status. They had the ability to vote if they lived off-reserve and gave up their special status. That wasn't an option for blacks in South Africa at the time. For their substandard living conditions, at least federal funding was given for reserves, with the option of leaving the reserves, which wasn't available to most blacks in South Africa. Not ""miles ahead"" in that limited regard relative to South Africa. We're talking about only a small percentage of Canada's population versus 90% of South Africa's that was being denied their basic rights."
britishcolumbia,392oiw,strangerunknown,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, First Nation were able to leave their reserves, but only after getting written approval by an Indian agent, a practice that continued into the 40's and 50's. Once they left the reserve, they were still barred from entering some businesses, although obviously not to the extent of apartheid. I agree that in most cases First Nations in Canada were better off than black people in South Africa, but a few cases they were not.  The most prominent case where First Nations were more disadvantaged than black people in South Africa was by having their ability to raise their own child taken away from them. Multiple generations of children were raised without parents, which has caused a great level of dysfunction on reserves that is seen today. Combined with the 60's scoop, we are now, in many cases, seeing children and teenagers to be the first generation of First Nations to be raised by their parents since their great-great-great grandparents. Although apartheid was despicably horrible, South African parents weren't forced to give up their children and were allowed to raise them under their own culture.  Again, I'm not saying that the life of a First Nation person in the 1950's was as bad or worse than the life of a black South African in the 1970's, but we are at least in the same ballpark."

There is no US border inspection station at this crossing, making it the only land border crossing where you may legally enter the United States without reporting for inspection. The US closed its border station, which was located in the same building as the Boundary Gift Shop, in the 1950s. As a result, all flights leaving the Hyder Seaplane Base to other cities in Alaska are treated as international arrivals, and all passengers, including Hyder residents must be inspected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers.   Hyder is the Easternmost community in Alaska.

The family was jobless in Manitoba and desperate, so the dad road the rails to Vancouver, eventually found work, and sent for the rest of them. Crossing through the Rockies by car on the then narrow road with hairpin turns on mountainsides, no guard rails, narrow dirt shoulders, and views straight down into the river, the little children spent the whole time on the floor of the car screaming and crying.   You can rest easy that the Trans-Canada and other BC highways have come a long way in the last 80 years. While driving in mountain passes can definitely be dangerous in the winter (cuz they get icy), especially in a car without snow tires, taking a bus through there in the summer will be as safe as anywhere else."

""say you are a server at a pub, even if you sign a contract saying the pub manager will deduct from your wages for any walkouts, such a deduction is illegal even if you agree to it.  -3 Special Circumstances, this case is what you fall under and the employer has the right to deduct wages, I ""Think"" it cannot be so much that it would push you under min wage though I am not 100% sure on that."

britishcolumbia,38fvme,alphawolf29,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:50:31 2015 UTC,"But it can't be ""just"" anything. If they attempt to deduct monies for a dubious reason you go to the labour board and they end up in deep shit. Not only do the have to reimburse the deduction but they get fined and more importantly they're now on the local labour board's radar.  There can be many reasons that Employers attempt to deduct off a paycheck that aren't legal. For example I worked at a restaurant and one of the cooks was a bit of a fuck up. He'd ruin product and other stuff, but what was the final straw he forgot to leave a tap running in the middle of winter (old building) which caused the pipes to burst. All the owner could do was fire him because no employee can be held accountable for an employer's loss even if they caused it.  In this case if the employee was overpaid the employer can deduct the monies because it's not the employees. That's why if you find out you've got monies in error you never spend it, the bank or whomever will be wanting it back sooner or later. OP, if there's a certain pay threshold that you can't fall below due to bill's and other obligations talk to your paymaster/HR department. They should be willing to work with you so it's not going to cause undue hardship. But don't expect miracles, it is their money after all, not bonus pay to do whatever you want with."

My SO is from Parry Sound so seen a bit of Ontario.   The maritimes were amazing. Friendliest people in Canada IMO. The Kootenays and okanagan Are beautiful.

I've heard that pay and the cost of living is similar to Calgary (but don't take my word for that). New Westminster has a lot of construction going on recently and is a really nice place to live. It's on the same side of the river as Vancouver, Burnaby and Coquitlam but has quick access to Surrey and Richmond. Surrey isn't too bad of a place to live in, but I've found there's nothing to do around here. If you're looking to stay close to Vancouver itself, Surrey or New West are your best bets. Surrey is huge so there is a lot to look around at for housing.   You should also ask over at /r/Vancouver. It's more active than this subreddit."

It's far easier if you can find an employer who will sponsor you on the basis that you have unique skills that no Canadian has. My advice would be to try to find such an employer anywhere in Canada and accept that you'll have to live wherever they're located while your residency paperwork goes through. Then once you have your PR you can start shopping around for the community you'd like to live in.
britishcolumbia,37qgwa,gas12n,2,Fri May 29 18:04:06 2015 UTC,Not true. If you have 6 months left in your work permit you are eligible for the provincial MSP (Medical service plan). Even if you become a citizen you'll have to pay medical costs out of pocket (or get your employer to pay them)

britishcolumbia,37qgwa,BohemianPunk,9,Fri May 29 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"I just spent the winter in Revelstoke, and have now moved to Vancouver. I'd suggest BC over Alberta (way more pretty nature everywhere, vs. a few mountains plus large expanses of flat lands everywhere else).   The Okanagan valley is a good suggestion based on what you seek, and if you need special help for your kids and a good chance of finding work, you'd have to aim for the bigger cities (Kelowna, Kamloops).   That being said there are a whole bunch of really cool places to live in the area that may still meet your main needs of job and good occasional medical care (that can be scheduled far in advance, and you can drive 2-3 hours if need be). e.g. Trail/Rossland/Nelson area, Revelstoke/Golden/Canmore areas. Not all of these will satisfy the 'ocean or big lake' desire tho... but they have awesome mountains, fantastic winters, lots of great outdoors to explore, and more often than not, lots of nearby navigable rivers.  If cost of living is a concern, you can consider living in central BC, i.e. Prince George, or possibly Prince Rupert by the coast but that's smaller.  Still lots of pretty nature, way less crowded / dense than Vancouver, and although they've had rough reputations in the past, things are improving a lot.   Otherwise, Vancouver is always a good bet. Easiest place to find work, medical care, education, etc. and meet all your family's needs. Don't be scared by people telling you its expensive... You can find a 2 br ground apartment for < $1500 CAD / month. I'm paying $1200 for mine, and it's 3 km south of downtown... If you can afford to pay more, you'll get a nicer or bigger place, or a better location. It's a beautiful city."
britishcolumbia,37qgwa,khaddy,3,Fri May 29 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"This is all solid advice. I'm a born-here Vancouverite who travels to the Okanagan regularly and works with people who have lived and worked further north (Prince George, Prince Rupert). All the advice given here is spot-on."

britishcolumbia,37qgwa,khaddy,2,Fri May 29 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"The problem with Vancouver is you'll never be able to buy a house there unless you win the lottery or something.  In March we got bedbugs in our apartment building. We've had to throw out every piece of furniture, about 10 grand worth of stuff. My sister in law in Chilliwack got bedbugs around the same time (total coincidence) and had to do the same. I'll never rent again. Insurance doesn't cover it. Landlords won't pay for it. You're taking a huge risk if you live in an apartment, townhouse, or anything with a shared wall.  Even if your neighbors are the cleanest people around, they could bring them home from a bus ride and get infested, and then they come over to you.  I'm probably a little paranoid right now because I've been living out of garbage bags for the last 3 months and now I'm going to be sleeping on an air mattress for the rest of the year until I can afford a new bed, but I'll never rent again.  At least on the island you can buy a house.."
britishcolumbia,37qgwa,gilbertsmith,3,Fri May 29 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"I think your first and last sentences were correct.   However, many people can't afford to buy a house in most places. Many people don't want to buy a house, because they relocate every few years, or chase jobs, or travel, etc. and prefer not to lock themselves in to one spot.   Also, especially for OP or people like me, who are relocating, it's not a problem to plan to rent for a few years, live in a big city, soak up the new place, establish networks, find a job, and THEN once you know the place and are settled, then you may consider buying a house, based on your income and better knowledge of the neighbourhoods and what you can afford.   Once again, not everyone has to buy a big house in the most expensive parts of Vancouver. Many of the jobs in fact are out in the suburbs, so maybe you can buy a cheaper house (<$500,000 ??) in the suburbs and still be close to the highway, sky train, etc.   I'm certainly not saying that there isn't an expensive real estate problem in Vancouver, I'm just suggesting that it's not a deal-breaker for the OP, especially in the first few years of moving to a new place.   As for the middle 2 paragraphs - that sucks big time and I sympathize :(   but you gotta recognize that it's a pretty rare, and isolated incident. Millions of people rent in BC and across Canada, USA, etc. Results may vary ... but the vast majority of them I don't think have catastrophic problems and losses on anything near a regular time line. Also, many people have their own homes, and suffer some kind of catastrophic destruction that isn't covered by insurance... Then they lose not just $10,000 in furniture, but hundreds of thousands of dollars of their property. It's like winning the shitty lottery ... happens once in a while. :("

We got lucky and came into enough money for a down payment, otherwise we'd be looking for some other place to rent.  At any rate I'd try to avoid as many shared walls as you can. Find a townhouse or duplex or something where you're only sharing one wall with someone and hope for the best.."
britishcolumbia,37qgwa,maybe_sparrow,1 point,Fri May 29 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind very small towns there are a few in the interior like Logan Lake which are close to highland valley copper mine, perhaps can get an industrial job there, plus its a nice area with plenty of land and outdoor recreation nearby. Maybe mid 30s during the summer peaks and can get plenty of snow, down to about -20 occasionally during the winter. 40 minute drive to Kamloops a decently sized city and about 3-4 hour drive to Vancouver and the coast.  It is a very small town though, under a few thousand in population. Like one school. So I'm not sure if it'll meet your educational requirements.   In BC though you've pretty much have to choose snow, or ocean. Rarely get snow on the coast unless you're far up north, but once you pass the interior mountain range you get a lot more snow in the winter. Unless you go coast and make frequent trips to ski hills and whatnot."

britishcolumbia,37qgwa,ReK_,1 point,Sat May 30 03:49:19 2015 UTC,"You could try taking a look at companies in Langley, it's probably the most industrial place in Vancouver area with tons of manufacturing plants, close to the US border and cost of living is much lower than Vancouver itself. Otherwise smaller towns with a pulp mill or a mine nearby could work too.  I believe depending on your age you can get a visa and just come here and work, or you may have to find work first, and then apply for a work visa.  Another big thing is accreditation, I have no clue what the equivalent is in the US but in Canada to work as a journeyman you need to get a Red Seal. I believe an industrial mechanic is a millwright here. Look into what sort of paperwork you need to recognize your welding/mechanical accreditation in BC specifically. Red Seal is Canada wide for trades like Carpentry, Plumbing etc., while each province also has its own trade accreditation for more niche trades.  Hope this helps! If all else fails, take a look at Washington and Oregon States, they are both quite similar to British Columbia but it may be easier on you in terms of moving and finding work. You could also consider working in Washington as a stepping stone before moving to Canada, as its close enough that you could drive up here for interviews and scout out the southern areas like Vancouver, Langley, Abbotsford, Okanagan etc. for where you would want to ultimately settle."
britishcolumbia,37qgwa,Iamthesmartest,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:54:45 2015 UTC,"I live in Vancouver, where the weather is very temperate. We get snow one or two weeks per year, it rarely gets over 30 degrees and it rains a lot. This is mostly because the ocean regulates the temperature yet Vancouver Island shields us from a lot of the coastal weather effects. The island and the interior of BC (places like Kelowna, Kamloops, Hope...) get significantly warmer during the summer and colder during the winter. If you want something near Vancouver yet actually affordable look at the fringe suburbs like Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, Abbortsford and Langley.  Immigration  Do some research on the immigration process. It will really help if you can find work and get your employer to nominate you. Your immediate goal will be to become a permanent resident. Then, after three years, you can apply for citizenship.  Education  Our public schools and the teachers in them vary just as much as they do in the states. All schools support special needs but some will do it better than others. Which school your children go to is generally determined by which area your house is in. Do your research, and you may want to consider choosing a school before choosing a home.  Health  Our public health care system is mandated by the federal government but administered by the provincial governments. In BC it's called the Medical Services Plan (MSP). Initially you will have to pay for all medical expenses yourself. To be covered you:   must be a citizen of Canada or be lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence; must make his or her home in B.C.; and must be physically present in B.C. at least six months in a calendar year, or a shorter prescribed period.*   Once you meet those requirements and enrol you, your spouse and dependants will be covered for many, but not all, things. The primary distinction is whether a procedure is ""medically necessary"" as determined by a physician or relevant specialist. Some notable things which aren't covered are routine dental appointments, eyeglasses, ""devices"" (things like crutches, splints, etc) and prescription drugs. While you'll probably find these things are a lot cheaper than in the US (always ask for alternate brand drugs when you fill a prescription) you must pay for them yourself. This is why we do still have private medical insurers in Canada.  Also, on top of the portion of taxes which goes to health care there is a monthly premium. It does scale with your net income, however, all the way down to $0 if you're in the bottom bracket.  You can find all of this info, and a lot more, at BC Health.  Gun Control  I mention this because of your military background. If you do have any guns you'll need to do some research into what class they fall under and the licences required. Essentially there are three classes: non-restricted, restricted and prohibited. Non-restricted are single-fire (eg: semi-auto, bolt action...) weapons with a long barrel (shotguns, hunting rifles, etc). You don't need a licence but there are limits on magazine size and a few other things. Restricted weapons have a shorter barrel. They also have magazine size limits, require a licence and have a number of rules about storage and transportation. Prohibited weapons are anything with a very short barrel (iirc <4"") or capable of full-auto/burst fire, as well as a long list of specific weapons. The only way you can legally posses a prohibited weapon is through a grandfathering rule.  Canada does have carry and concealed carry licences however it is only available if you work in a job which requires it (police, armoured car staff, etc). Normal citizens cannot carry weapons in public, whether openly or concealed.  Note: BC and Alberta are provinces, not territories. We do have three territories: Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. The difference is provinces have their own provincial government (equivalent to a state), territories do not and are controlled directly by the federal government."

Honestly coming from California, 8 months of -20 to -40 will probably wear thin. I'd probably avoid going north of Kamloops in BC or Calgary in Alberta.  Vancouver Island sounds like what you're after. I'm not sure about the doctor situation there but it's probably not that bad. You've got ocean potential, mild weather, and it's not as busy as Vancouver or as expensive.

britishcolumbia,37eziv,MondayMonkey1,1 point,Wed May 27 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"Cost Benefit Analysis, as the article mentioned, often comes down to the discount rate you apply to future flows of benefits.  Conventional projects discount future positives (electricity in this case) against upfront costs, which in this case include loss of land, concrete, labour, and other services needed to build a dam.  By choosing a higher discount rate, you decrease the stated value of future electricity and tip the scales towards a no-go decision.    Note that this discount rate isn't purely a financing rate.  This is the social discount rate, the rate at which you discount future social benefits against present day benefits.  In a lot of cases, this won't coincide with financial market interest rates, which can be very confusing to policy makers and the general public.   Another related topic the article somewhat mentioned was the topic of risky future forecasts.  A 30 year plan will have more sensitivity to risk and uncertainty than a 3 year project.  We are all risk averse meaning we prefer certainty.  This is a cost itself, which must be included.  Standard analysis only concerns deterministic risk (probability of collapse for example) but often these projects take significant exposure to exogenous uncertainties.  In this case, changes in the global energy market and emerging alternative energy technologies could massively affect this project well into the future in a way we could never predict.    CBA is hard, even without the politics.  We have lots of great examples of great projects to consider all around us (Sea to Sky is a great one)."

Chief among them are the potential for rising domestic gas prices and lowering international  prices, eliminating the arbitrage needed to pay off the multi-billion dollar investments required.  The structure of BC’s LNG Tax, recently halved, means that British Columbians, the public  owners of the resource, will not see peak revenue flows until these capital investments are paid off, making them the back stoppers of these risks, as well as the recipients of the impacts on public infrastructure and the environment.  It is unlikely that anything close to the revenue projected by the BC government for its coffers will ever be realized.    Amongst other information."
britishcolumbia,37dbkt,trendless,2,Wed May 27 08:11:35 2015 UTC,"Well I'm glad SOMEONE is finally talking about the elephant in the room: domestic gas prices. They should be indexed somehow so that regardless of global prices, Canadians still get to pay the low prices afforded by having enough to supply our own needs, fully. This should include provisions to make sure domestic demand is always filled first. I know this flies in the face of profitability vis a vis export, but I'm one of those crazy folks who thinks Canada needs to ensure the good of the many is always put first.  As for global prices dropping, it's inevitable. High prices seem to be entirely the result of east Asian demand. Thing is, they only have a lack of supply because the only east Asian country that has enough land to have natural resources also sucks at internal technology development -- they tend to make advancements in many areas only at the behest of (ahem) ""acquisition"". And on that front, they've made quite a few legitimate, high profile M+As lately, which should provide them with enough know how to properly access their own vast natural gas reserves, of which every nation with enough land seems to have a glut. The di or tri decade LNG contract bonanza we're currently living through -- the thing that is responsible for this vigorously renewed interest in LNG -- may be the last of its kind. Frankly, given the widespread availability of frackable formations, I'm not confident LNG has the potential to be an kind of global import/export kingmaker unless we find (or invest in developing) substantially new and potentially revolutionary uses for the stuff. It certainly could be a nearly drop-in replacement for oil in a whole host of things from fertilizer and plastics to fuel for our vehicles. But the powers that be would have to will it."

britishcolumbia,372o9l,IllPickOneLater,3,Sun May 24 15:47:23 2015 UTC,"I've been through this process.  Many landlords will try to get you to sign a lease when you first move in, as it encourages you to stay for at least a year.  Obviously landlords don't like to have tenants leave without notice, and they will try to find out your intentions as the end of lease approaches.  Does your current agreement have a move out clause?  If not then I would suggest that you tell the landlord that your plans aren't set, and you may decide to transition to a month to month rental.  You still have until the end of June to give official notice, and you can withdraw your notice if you change your mind."
britishcolumbia,372o9l,MyOtherAvatar,1 point,Sun May 24 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you, my lease does have an end date and my landlords will not consider renting month to month (I brought this up last year at lease signing time).   My landlords are snowbirds who are gone for much of the year, which is why they prefer yearly leases (so they don't have to worry about a drop in income or trying to find a renter while they are away). I don't begrudge them this, but it does make it hard to find another appropriate place.  I can't find anything in my lease about having to give two months notice, so I will email the property agent asking for clarification. I just hope they don't actually plan to start showing my home before I have even decided, it seems like a major inconvenience and an invasion of privacy."
britishcolumbia,372o9l,MyOtherAvatar,1 point,Mon May 25 08:03:24 2015 UTC,"Contact the Residential Tenancy Branch first.

We don't need insulation on our houses because we're basically polar bears.   And our roads were designed to provide you a more authentic Wilderness Adventure feel.

You really want to make sure there are no food smells in your tent and bag, for the dead obvious reasons.  And you want to learn how to throw and rig a proper cache line, because going hungry sucks."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,1 point,Mon May 18 07:15:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware of how to behave in bear country, and from what I read, there are also food containers in some of the campgrounds. But I still have a lot of respect of the bears, because it's something new for me. I never had to think about this kind of danger in my previous backpacking trips... But I also haven't seen a bear so that may be a nice experience, if I see one and everything ends up well. :)"
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,3,Mon May 18 07:22:51 2015 UTC,"In my opinion if everything works out nicely on my backpacking trips, I don’t see any large animals.  Maybe it’s because I’m a rural-raised Canuck and have seen all the animals before.  So I wasn’t at all happy when I encountered mom black and her cubs on the trail I intended to hike and had to abandon (it criss-crossed their path too many times, as we were both heading uphill).  Really wasn’t happy to startle a griz.  The elk was neat, but it was rutting season and they’re enormous and pissy.  Very pissy.  And walking within a few feet of a habituated black that was pigging out on berries was not my favourite moment.  And being trapped in a cabin while a black tried to get in, that wasn’t fun either.  …oh, and porcupines.  Not that they’re large animals, but my encounter with them was the worst.  The sound they make, it’s like a baby being tortured.  For hours.  In the pitch black of night.  Fuck porcupines.  (Gingerly.)"

britishcolumbia,36cbop,Rikkochet,1 point,Mon May 18 06:39:11 2015 UTC,"Not yet. I read that they open the registrations at April 17th, and it fills up on that day, so I'm beyond that.

britishcolumbia,36cbop,goodknighte,3,Mon May 18 06:42:48 2015 UTC,"They accept a small number of standby hikers every day, but that means you might not get in and have to hang out in Port Renfrew or Bamfield for a day and try again the next day. Unless you have a larger party you likely won't have to wait (according to the rangers who've told me that numerous times). It's worth it if you have the gear, though. I strongly recommend starting from the Port Renfrew trailhead and hiking north."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,1 point,Mon May 18 19:51:10 2015 UTC,"There will be just two of us, so not a large party, and I think we have the right gear. Why do you recommend hiking north?"
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,2,Tue May 19 05:24:43 2015 UTC,"The first day has a lot happening:   You start from sea level and hike to the highest point of the trail, then end back at sea level Thrasher Cove is a really small campsite and it's good to get there early so you can pitch your tent in a decent spot. I've heard people scrambling in the middle of the night who were a little too close to the tide line. If you can get favourable tides, the second day from Thrasher Cove around Owen Point on the sandstone shelf is without a doubt the most beautiful part of the trail. You can also walk it in the opposite direction.   All the really spectacular sights are (imo) in the first half of the hike. It's nice to be able to appreciate them while you're still relatively fresh.  Another reason to hike north is that you can hike up Sandstone Creek, which is unique and a lot of fun. You walk the sandstone shelf to Sandstone Creek and then pseudo-rappel down a boulder to get to the creek bed (at low tide!). Then you can hike up the creek and rejoin the trail at a foot bridge. The trail up the creek changes every year.  If you haven't read Blisters and Bliss it might be worth grabbing a copy off Amazon. I usually do the trail in 7 days (with one day in the middle where we only hike an hour and spend most of the time relaxing on the beach), and it's nice to know all the tricks of the trail."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,1 point,Tue May 19 06:18:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info. I already read recommendations to hike the WCT north, but I wanted to ask why. :)  I definitely plan to buy the Blisters and Bliss book. I already ordered my GF to buy it in MEC, and send it to me. :)"
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,2,Tue May 19 06:39:02 2015 UTC,"If you don't get on the WCT, your fall back plan could be the Juan de Fuca trail. It's further to the south, but follows the same coast line, and you don't need a permit to get on it. I've done both, and enjoyed the chillness of the JdFT, a lot of people do the WCT because it's so famous, and so there's quite a ""scene"" about it. I did both trails though in the shoulder season (like you will be) and suspect you won't be competing with too many tourists at that time, which is awesome. Have fun!"
britishcolumbia,36cbop,goodknighte,1 point,Mon May 18 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"At first I wanted to do the WCT in the beginning, right after my arrival, 22nd August. But because I don't have the reservations, I decided that it may be better to move it to the end of my stay, so starting around the 11th September. I'm hoping there will not be as many hikers at that time, and we can get in without a long wait. I'd also like to start the WCT during the week, not on the weekend, but I'm not sure if the time will allow it. :)"
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,3,Tue May 19 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"The single most glorious hike in the Rockies is a little walk up Mt. Wilcox on a clear day.  It’s behind the bus barns at the Athabasca Glacier between Banff and Jasper.  You get a 360° unobstructed vista of the ice fields, the glacier, a zillion mountains, and the valley.  For the effort involved, there is no better payoff.  If you can make it to Kootenay Glacier Park there’s some great scenery.  The core is a little busy, but there are several other areas that receive a lot less traffic, especially since several of the trails are no longer maintained.  A ton of mining history there, too, which makes for some pretty neat sights (old cabins, old mineshafts, old mining equipment; look and leave it behind.)  If you make it out to Field you can get a tour into one of the world’s richest fossil beds, the Burgess Shale beds (the area is otherwise closed off to the public).  There are also several caves in the area; I think you can get tours for them as well.  If you’re stuck near the lower mainland (Vancouver), check out Cathedral Park.  I believe the backcountry tenting area is in a caldera; the rim hike is spectacular and full of interesting rock.  Also, the areas up in the Whistlers and Garibaldi are spectacular.  The Juan de Fuca trail is a good alternative to the WCT.  Also, there’s an interior mountain range on the island that I’ve eyeballed a few times; I think it would be an amazing bit of hiking (just looked it up: Strathcona Park).  And, too, there are some kayak excursions that would make an exceptionally interesting alternative to hoofing it.  If you want a hardcore, remote experience, the Stein Valley is between Vancouver and Kamloops, and promises to be rugged, strenuous, and isolated.  I’ve never made it out there, sadly; my hiking days had to end too soon.  BTW, if you’re taking the highway toward Kamloops, take either the 99 through Whistler or the old #1 up through Hells Gate.  They are infinitely more interesting than that Coquihalla.    If you can make it out to Waterton National Park, in the SW corner of Alberta, do so.  An amazing area.  The drive along the Crowsnest highway is sweet, too.  Honestly, there is literally no end to the amazing hiking in this province.  You can hike for years, decades, and not see the end of it.  I recommend you hit up Mountain Equipment Co-op when you get to Vancouver or Victoria.  They are well-equipped with hiking guides and intelligent staff.  They’ll be very helpful in figuring out what you can do in the time you’re here."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,goodknighte,1 point,Mon May 18 08:03:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the suggestions. I'll definitely look into all of those, and see what's possible to do during the 2-3 weeks time frame.  I'd like to order at least some guides in advance, so I can plan ahead, before I get to BC. :)  What about the Coast Mountains? For example the Tweedsmuir Provincial Park or Ts'yl-os Provincial Park. That looks remote, but I didn't find a lot of useful info on the web about backpacking trails. Just some kayak and guided tours. I'm mostly interested in multi-day trails, like the WCT, but not guided. And circular if possible. :)  You're right, there's just so many places to go, that's why I'd like to plan ahead if possible, so I can make good use of my limited time there.  EDIT: Mt. Wilcox really looks like a great hike! The Waterton National Park looks great too, but I think that's a little bit too far away from Vancouver. The Stein Valley looks interesting, and it's just 3 hours from Vancouver."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,2,Mon May 18 08:17:02 2015 UTC,"I’m afraid almost all my hiking was in the interior ranges.  Tweedsmuir will not be on your itinerary unless you’re planning to hire a plane.  Keep in mind that BC is huge.  Four times the size of Britain.  Three of Italy.  Almost two of France.  To get into the good bits of Tweedsmuir would take you days — too much time wasted when you want to be hiking.  I think you should stick to the Island, given your limited time.  For kayaking, you should be looking at the Nootka Islands, IIRC; remote, fewer visitors, gorgeous.  Do the Juan de Fuca (make sure to spend a day at its north end; if you can scuba, that’s a great place for it, a fascinating intersection of ocean life zones) or the WCT hike.  See if you can get into Clayoquot; the old-growth forest is stunning.  Then head inland and stomp around the Strathcona range.  These are rugged mountains, and the views are going to be sweet.  I think that if you really had it together, you could bus to the WCT, hike it, then puddle-jump from Bamfield to Ucluelet, get up to Tofino, try surfing, catch a seaplane to the Nootka inlet, spend a few days paddling the islands there, then get into Strathcona Park to summit a few peaks.  It’d be insanely busy and exhausting, and may be a bit pricey, but would hit all the highlights without wasting your time with travel.  Play with google maps to find travel times.  You’ll find that most of the parks I talked about previously will eat up way too much of your precious time just getting to them.  You really need to come here for about four months..."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,KirbyGiver,1 point,Mon May 18 08:43:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's exactly the kind of information I'm looking for, ""It's too far, don't waste your time."" :)  I'm aware of the great distances, but as an European, I'm used to having roads go everywhere, so I can get almost anywhere with a car. I know it's a bit different in Canada, so that's also the reason I'm trying to get as much information I can, to get a sense what is doable and what is not. :) I don't want to waste money on planes, I guess they are not cheap...  I looked at Banff before, and it's about 850 km from Vancouver, that should be doable in one day, right? And I can stop for a few days at Glacier National Park, if it's worth it. I'm used to driving around 1000-1200 km in a day in Europe... Also the Stein Valley is not a big detour from the route.  What's a puddle jump? I'm not interested that much in surfing or kayaking, although I'm not completely against it. The Strathcona Provincial Park looks like another great destination. It sucks that I don't have more vacation days. :)  Thanks again, you've been very helpful."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,MrPlowBC,2,Mon May 18 09:02:54 2015 UTC,"Vancouver to Banff is one long day.  If the Rockies are where you want to be, landing in Calgary is the better option.  The Banff-Jasper corridor is spectacular.  There are a ton of trails throughout that area.  Much fun.  Stein is a couple days hike in to get above the treeline, IIRC.  Very rugged, very wild, very bear-y.  Might not be a good choice for a solo hiker, come to think of it.  Glacier NP has a few awesome viewpoints, but is otherwise a highway running along the base of near-vertical mountains.  Any hiking there is a grind.  I imagine the puddle jump would be a water taxi; someone with an fishing boat willing to run you across the mouth of the bay to the other side.  Long Beach is between Ucluelet and Tofino, very pretty.  How many kilometers/how many nights are you looking to stay out in the back country?"
britishcolumbia,36cbop,TemplesOfSyrinx,1 point,Mon May 18 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"I cannot change where I fly. I have to go to Vancouver, and I already have a plane ticket. I will not be going solo, my GF is already in Vancouver, so that's our base, and we'll be traveling together. I don't mind spending one or two days in a car. I hope the road will be at least a bit scenic, and we can stop for example in Glacier National Park for one day, or whatever. The plan is not set in stone yet. Rockies are just the place what you see recommended everywhere, so it's one of the possible destinations for me.  I will have 4 weeks total. So I have about one week for WCT, then one week for travel between parks, rest, and Vancouver itself, and I hope to spend the 2 remaining weeks (10-14 days) backpacking somewhere, so maybe two or three multi-day treks. Plus some one-day hikes, for example Mt. Wilcox. :)  I'm not sure about the kilometers, because I don't know about the terrain and difficulty. I'm used to 1000-1500 vertical meters, and 20-25 km distance a day in Alps."
britishcolumbia,36cbop,jayo_bc,3,Mon May 18 16:19:46 2015 UTC,"Four weeks and a companion makes everything possible!  The hikes you’ve done, assuming that includes packing ~15kg (ie. not hut-to-hut) are exactly the sort I did back in the day.  The highways in BC are all spectacular.  And challenging.  It’s a very, very mountainous province.  Lots of impressive highway engineering.  See if you can plan out this route:  Vancouver ->  Kaslo -> Kokanee Glacier Park. There you’ll do a 3 or 4 day hike: in to Silver Spray, traverse to Woodbury, return to trailhead.  Then south to the Balfour Ferry, south to Creston (you can rent a canoe, paddle a wetlands sanctuary), then east into the Crowsnest Pass.  Day hike Turtle Mountain, tour the Frank Slide, tour the mineshaft.  On to Waterton, do the Akamina/Carthew day hike and Crypt Lake day hike.  Head toward Banff via Kananaskis Hwy 22, do any of the hikes along there; or blow on through and focus on any of the many hikes in the Banff/Jasper parks.  Consult the guides to find out which ones are going to be least busy.  Summit Mt. Wilcox on a day when you need a rest.  Now either return to Banff and head west; stop in Field and do the fossil tour, and summit Mt. Stephen.  Stop at the bottom of the Roger’s Pass and climb the mountain you are facing when you come down that steep hill; should be great views over the ice fields.  Then over to Revelstoke, do the Mt Revelstoke flower fields if they’re in-season; head south to catch the ferry and stop in at Halcyon Hot Springs for a well-deserved break.  Head the #6 into the Okanagan and do wine tours to finish your vacation.  Head out via the north end of the valley, along 97 to Kamloops (fascinating hoodoo country out there), then the old #1 to Cache Creek, and then either 99 through Whistler or old #1 south to Vancouver.  Either is much more interesting than the 97C/#5 highway.  Alternatively, instead of doing the #1 after Wilcox, keep going north into Jasper, do whatever you fancy for hiking there, then head west to Tete Jaune Cache and south to Wells Grey.  There is an excellent tour operator there by name of Roland Neave.  There’s a ton of interesting stuff to see there, though probably none of it will involve summiting a peak.  Then you’ll end up in Kamloops and take #1 or #99 back to Vancouver.  A hike in Whistler/Garibaldi would be good.  It’ll be a whirlwind tour, but some of it involves true backcountry camping, a lot of it hits the most spectacular vistas, and it doesn’t retrace your steps.  Have your girlfriend pick up the appropriate copies of the BC Backroads Mapbooks.  For a good chunk of this trip, you can camp in forestry campsites.    (Oh, and if you happen to be in a 4x4 truck, see if you can do St. Mary’s Alpine Park.  Virtually untouched.  Wild terrain, volcanic IIRC.  It’ll be very remote, very unique.)"

Seems like every couple of weeks one of these guys just vanishes despite us having the technology to keep track of them.

The parole board aren't just throwing darts: they release people after a lot of deliberation.  Parolees mostly disappear because they don't want to be involved with the justice system and have to walk a parole restriction tightrope, not as part of a nefarious plan to reoffend. And with all the massive warnings that police departments put out whenever they're trying to integrate into a community, it's not like they can just settle down and get a job."
britishcolumbia,35r9cl,HotterRod,5,Tue May 12 23:29:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all those points, however that doesn't change the fact that he ""has four prior convictions for sexual assault against women and children, and is considered a high risk to reoffend"", and that they don't know where he is.  This might not be an issue at all if they had a low-cost GPS tracker on him. There could even be any number of innocent reasons why he didn't check in, but if they could easily find him it would be a non-issue and the public wouldn't have to be notified and possibly alarmed.  Just because something rarely happens isn't reason not to improve the system."

History tells us he has about a 1 in 4 chance of reoffending, even without his classification. If we have to let him out, then we should be able to track his movements.  I hope they catch him and he goes in quietly, but if he hurts another innocent person then it's the fault of the state."

I'm pretty sure in this case it was the police who labelled him as ""high risk to reoffend"" as they have more direct access to the media, more PR savvy and far more incentive to communicate than the parole board."

britishcolumbia,35r9cl,copperlight,2,Tue May 12 23:34:03 2015 UTC,It's worth the cost if it prevents one person from re-offending. The cost of an investigation and trial runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

From what I've seen on facebook it sounds like she went to bed in the camper and he stayed up sitting by the campfire and fell asleep (which the news articles have been saying). His fiance posted a video on facebook on the 7th of the wolf mentioned in the news story sniffing about their camp as they watch it from inside their camper. In the video the fire pit looks to be roughly 25 feet from the camper and just beyond the fire pit their car is parked. It sounds like it was over fairly quickly as he allegedly had no defensive wounds, its possible he didn't even scream. I am familiar with the area they were in but don't know the exact location of their camp but it may have been close to running water so any sound may have been muffled, which could explain why the fiance heard nothing, we are still getting a fair amount of spring run off in the creeks and rivers up here."

britishcolumbia,35opip,Lydiahall,3,Tue May 12 07:06:45 2015 UTC,"As someone currently in the BC public school system, I would say put them in kindergarten. I have grown up around a lot of kids who go to private school and it is hard for them for a couple of reasons. One being that the school is based more on looking impressive to other private schools in some cases so important things like field trips and fun class activities are pushed under the rug. Another is the stigma put on private school kids by the public school kids and that can prevent friendships if you put your child in sports or something similar, which is sad but true. The thing I am realizing in my grade 12 year is the benefit of being in a public school because of all the bursaries and scholarships offered to the school that aren't offered to any of the private schools in my area. In other places in the province it may be different but a lot more people go through public school than private so nearly all legacy funds are in the public school system. When people think about starting a bursary program for a school, first thought is almost always the public school."

Check out all the lakes in and around Powell River, good place to swim or boat if you happen to meet some friendly locals that are willing to take you out. Eagle River before Powell River is awesome, you can jump off a waterfall. Cortes Island/Hague Lake. There's great mountain biking in seschelt and gibons, just ask a bike shop how to get to the trails. Lund is a nice place to chill, also on the way to Savary.

britishcolumbia,35iory,Firsmith,3,Mon May 11 04:53:22 2015 UTC,"This one is in my wheel house, I grew up there. Question? Are you going from end-to-end? Staying a while and staying somewhere? Where are you coming from? Time of year?    Check out the Skookumchuck narrows (Egmont), but make sure you go when the tide is running (going in or out) it is best to go during a big tide. The walk is about half an hour in. Francis Point Provincial Park is very beautiful and not very busy. Hike to the top of Mt. Daniel is steep, and physical, but the view is beautiful. (If you do any of the above 3, grab a beer after at the Garden Bay Pub) Smugglers and Secret Coves (Halfmoon Bay) are gorgeous. Thomanby Island (Halfmoon Bay) is beautiful, especially on a nice sunny day. Look into Halfmoon Sea Kayaks for a tour/guided trip over there from the Rockwater resort. Its a nice paddle, but it can be challenging during the tide change. Drive through Halfmoon Bay, stop at the old General Store, grab a coffee and walk to the end of the government wharf. Go to Coopers Green for the sunset. The Botanical Garden in West Sechelt is very nice.  Sechelt has a few nice shops, decent restaurants to check out. If you are into hiking, check out Tetrahedron Provincial Park. You can rent kayaks in Sechelt Inlet next to the Lighthouse Pub. The pub itself has a beautiful view (I sat there last weekend and watched a herd of elk above the gravel pit). Take a drive down Sechelt Inlet road to Sandy Hook/Tuwanek. If you are into the mountain bike scene (more on this later) the Coast Gravity Park is up that way. Grab an gelato in Davis Bay and walk along the boardwalk to the pier. Go for a swim. Get a coffee at Straight Coffee Hang out in lower Robert's Creek, grab coffee, meal, drink, or all of the above at the Gumboot. Keep in mind - you're on ""creek time"" here. People/Things move slower. You'll see/meet some interesting people with alternative lifestyles in the creek. Walk down to the beach and check out the mandala. If the tide is low, people will be all over that beach. Check out the shops in Lower Gibsons. Molly's Reach is still there from the old CBC TV show Beachcombers. Some nice places to eat down there, Smitty's oyster bar is very popular with tourists (locals go too). Go to Persephone brewing in upper Gibsons. Hike up Soames Hill first to earn it. I've already named a few hikes, but if you are into that sort of thing, the coast is absolutely covered with great hikes. Everything from wheelchair access, to multiday adventures. Ask locals, tourist info centers, Google, and the local outdoor stores for advice. If you are into mountain biking, the coast is an absolute Meca. Locals have known this for years, and more and more tourists are starting to find out. There are great downhill/freeride routes in Gibsons/Roberts Creek and the Coast Gravity Park in Sechelt. For XC there's amazing riding in Halfmoon Bay, West Sechelt, Roberts Creek and Gibsons. (with lesser known trails in Pender Harbour, Davis Bay etc).  There are many places to rent kayaks all over the coast.    If you have any specific questions let me know.  Edit** It can be fun to do the ""circle route"" Start in Vancouver, do my list in reverse order, take the ferry from Earl's Cove to Saltery Bay, drive to Powell River (see others' suggestions for that area) take the ferry to Comox, spend time in the Comox Valley (Cumberland is a personal favorite of mine), and then drive down to Nanaimo (stop in Qualicum Beach, detour to Coombs, Parksville. Catch the boat back to Vancouver."
britishcolumbia,35iory,iknowwhereiam,2,Mon May 11 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"Gumboot is awesome! We do a lot of mountain biking on the Sunshine Coast and always eat there.   Great list overall. I'd like to add a few things:   If you have kids, hit up the rec centre in Sechelt - salt water pool, diving boards, water slides. Great place to go if the weather turns. Day trip to Savory Island.  Hit the brew pubs - Persephone in Gibsons and Townsite in Powell River. There are probably others by now. Porpoise Bay Provincial Park has a great beach for making discoveries, and allows day visits.    EDIT: Whoops, Persephone was already mentioned. Still, doesn't hurt to mention it again!"

If you're a little more adventurous, there is the Monkman Memorial Trail located in Monkman Provincial Park appx 60km from town. The trail, which is located in the middle of nowhere, goes through some of the most untouched wilderness in the world. Its about 25k to monkman lake, which is the extent of the maintained trail. It continues up into the alpine and drops down for a couple river crossings, but this section of the trail requires a gps and is considered ""expert only"".

If you're stopping in Hope, the Othello tunnels are always fun to see.  Yale is kind of historic I guess, might be worth poking around off the highway.  The tunnels in the canyon are neat.  Hell's Gate is always a nice stop. I've been down the tram once but I'd go again. Their hours are a bit short so I'd plan ahead if you want to check it out.  Lytton was interesting to see. You should stop at the Esso along the highway and use the washroom. It's horrifying. The Thompson and Fraser meeting is neat to see, two different colored rivers. The street signs are bilingual English/Native which is neat.  Quesnel has a few touristy things, that bridge comes to mind. Not much else there.  After PG you've got a 4 hour drive with no cell service to look forward to. The Pine Pass looks nice if you've never been through it before I guess.

britishcolumbia,34vxoy,d4rk_sh4d0w,2,Fri May 8 04:44:55 2015 UTC,"I would seriously suggest moving to Marpole (as someone else suggested), a neighbourhood in Vancouver that's directly north of Richmond. I'm saying this as someone who grew up in Richmond and Delta (south of Richmond), and as an adult eventually moved to Marpole, before moving to downtown Vancouver. Marpole is the last (relatively) cheap rental neighbourhood in Vancouver West. They're building all sorts of huge high rises amidst the low-rise (4 storeys and below) apartments and single family houses that make up marpole. Not the most walkable neighbourhood but parts of it have character.  But most importantly, you're literally right across the Oak St. Bridge from Richmond. Easy commute. I LOVED living in Marpole because my family was still in Delta while I was attending UBC. From Marpole, downtown is a straight shot down Oak, Granville, or Cambie, but if you need to go into Richmond or beyond via Highway 99 to the border you're not dealing with any intracity traffic."

britishcolumbia,34vxoy,rifrif,2,Tue May 5 03:06:09 2015 UTC,"Richmond is nice but it is VERY VERY VERY heavily populated with chinese people.   if you speak mandarin or even cantonese its a great city. but if you dont, it might be a little annoying but not hard. I personally do not like the transit in Richmond, but if you have a car its great.  i know a lot of people who commute to richmond from New Westminster (where i live) or burnaby or vancouver.  some come from Surrey but theres a lot of traffic during rush hour if you come from surrey.  I would say BC and Cali have very similar work culture.   if you are just buying stuff tax is usually 12% 5% GST 7% PST 5% is like the goods and services tax so you'll pay it on food and services but not on clothes etc. Richmond will be fairly easy to rent in since its not vancouver, so it should be cheaper its just... VERY VERY ASIAN. that kind of stuff doesnt bother me too much since i'm part asian, but I dont speak a lick of any language other than english so its hard for me to get around. (and its near a skytrain i believe)   I personally live in New Westminster because its very central to a lot of cities and the majority of people speak english."
britishcolumbia,34vxoy,rhinny,2,Tue May 5 05:11:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely don't limit yourself to living in Richmond, even if that's where you'll be working. Richmond is very accessible from the rest of Greater Vancouver. Richmond is kind of blank and personality free. The residential parts are just apartment block after apartment block and you do feel the need to drive everywhere. Nearby, Marpole is a decent area with a bit more character and more affordable rents, but you could live anywhere along the Canada Line skytrain and have a quick commute. There's much more of a public transit culture here than in California, so it's worth considering leaving the car at home.  I can't help with software salaries, but income tax is easily estimated using online calculators (remember, if you're high earning you'll also have to pay some taxes back home in the USA.)  Rents can vary from 'hmm, that's a bit more than I was expecting' to 'Jesus how does anyone afford to live here?' Surprisingly there are still a lot of places within reach of a young professional in the West End, which is vibrant, fun, and so accessible to great food, cultural activities, beaches, Stanley Park, and transit to all areas (can you tell it's my hood?) Renting an apartment is fairly simple (Craigslist being the most popular option), but watch out for rental scams. They're an epidemic here.   I don't have personal experience with SoCal work culture, but here there is quite a bit of focus on the employee and their welfare and happiness. Workers have a lot of rights and employers tend to respect that. Canadian culture overall has an emphasis on work-life balance and personal fulfillment.  Also want to trade? I am sort of obsessed with California right now and I wish I had the opportunity to move down there for a while. I just got back from a trip to Palm Springs and L.A. and maaan it hurts to be home. I miss the palm trees and the architecture.  edit: Richmond does have SUPER cheap groceries, so it's got that going for it."

If you had more time, I'd suggest driving to Nelson, the heart of the Kootenays.  If you like driving and nature, I don't think there's a better place on earth."
britishcolumbia,34qyzh,TheRealJuventas,2,Sun May 3 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"If you want all, you should stay near Jasper and stay near Banff separately. There won't be a central town good for getting to all those places. Just use the google maps app to see travel times between those places."
britishcolumbia,34qyzh,LafayetteHubbard,2,Sun May 3 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"Having done just such a trip several times, here are my top tips:  where to stay: stay in either Banff or Canmore. Banff is prettier but more expensive. Canmore is cheaper, just outside the park and about a 30 minute drive into Banff. A lot of people who work in Banff live in Canmore. The only reason to stay in Canmore is the limitations of your budget : ) Everything you want to see is easily accessible from here.  Jasper/ Glacier National park: The scenery around Banff is stunning and if I had only a week to get from/to Calgary I would skip Jasper altogether. It's controversial, I know, people!  Hear me out!  Here's what you miss by NOT going to jasper:   Athabasca Falls (stunning) boat trip to Spirit Island (stunning) baked deliciousness at the Bear's Paw Bakery (ohmygodsogood!) scenery and lakes around jasper (meh) jasper town (meh)   The reason I'd skip Jasper is that it's a long drive there and back, for really more of the same kinda thing. Yes, the drive up the Icefields parkway is (mostly) spectacular, but the whole thing costs you three whole days, 2 of which are mostly driving... The only caveat would be if you were to fly INTO Calgary and continue on from Edmonton... but the mileage is still enormous, plus there will be an extra cost from the car rental drop off, so ask yourself, do you want to see the Rockies from the car or do you want some lazy time snoozing by a lake or sipping tea at the Chateau Lake Louise? I loved the Columbia Icefield/ Athabasca glacier tour the first time I went there in the early 90s but at this point there's almost no glacier left, and when we were there 2 years ago I was so disappointed I added it to me 'skip it next time' list. It's now just a muddy valley of rubble.  So, I would concentrate on the Canmore/ Banff/ lake Louise area. It's really beautiful, I'd say the scenery is the most dramatic compared to further north and you get the most mountains for your driving mileage.  Yoho, Kootenay and Glacier parks are not so easily accessible, unless you're really into back-country hiking. Or long drives.  Absolute must-do's (in my humble opinion)   Banff Gondola. I've been on a lot of mountains but the view from this particularly easy, tourist-accessible mountain is mindblowing. Go.  Don't forget your camera and maybe some nuts to feed the chipmunks. Moraine lake & Valley of the 10 Peaks/ Larch valley/ Sentinel Pass hike. (it has a bunch of names) This is a moderate day hike starting from Moraine Lake http://www.trailpeak.com/trail-Larch-Valley-Sentinel-Pass-near-Banff-AB-1384 If you want to do one hike, make it this one. I've done many hikes in the Rockies, but this is special. We took 2 fairly unfit (and quite overweight) european visitors up there 2 years ago and they didn't stop talking about it for the rest of the trip. You'll need sturdy shoes/ light hiking boots and maybe some walking sticks or ski poles to help your knees on the descent. The trails are good and you don't have to go up to the Pass unless you want to look down into the next valley. The first 45 mins is the hardest- it's switchbacks, but on a good trail and you're under the trees, so it's not too hot. After that you're up in the meadows, the path levels out and the views make you forget your sore knees... bring water and lunch- you'll want to stay up there forever.  After you come back down, have a quick look at Morraine lake from the rockpile. It's real purdy. (if you like warm water, head for the Banff Upper Hot Springs. Especially nice after a hike! It's nothing special, but kinda fun to say you've been.) Wildlife watching on the Bow Valley parkway or even better the Lake Minnewanka Scenic Drive Go for a drive along this road in the later afternoon/ early evening. It will take you past lake Minnewanka. Try to be at Two Jack Lake for sunset and gaze at Mt Rundle reflected on the water... http://www.canadianrockies.net/banff/bnpdandw.html You'd be very unlucky to not see ANY wildlife on this drive in the early evening. Lake Louise walk along the shore path, look at the galcier, check out the hotel, maybe rent a canoe and paddle about for a bit, if you feel so inclined. It's nice, and you'll feel like you've stepped into a postcard.  Just avoid the tour bus hordes if you can... Johnston Canyon funky narrow canyon with metal bridges and a surprise at the end. Go see it!   PM me if you need more info. have a great trip- it's a beautiful part of the country!"

After that we'll do a day long drive down through Banff/Yoho/Kootenay, a night in Canmore and then another long drive back to Edmonton via the David Thomas highway which the aforementioned friends said was amazing.

Check it out!  I'm also happy to answer any questions you might have.    To answer your 2 questions:    What would be the best 'central' town to stay in? Lake Louise? Golden? Banff? We're on a bit of a budget so less expensive is better, but we're willing to spend a little more for a more convenient/more pleasant location.   We generally recommend Canmore as a great place to launch your adventure in the Rockies.  It's only about 15 minutes from Banff, right outside the park gates.  You avoid the really high prices in Banff, but enjoy all the natural beauty of the Rockies.  It's also got some absolutely fantastic mountain vistas in it's own right.  Here's a guide specific to Canmore.     If we stay in, say, Lake Louise are Jasper and Glacier National Parks too far away to be worth it? Would we be better off spending that extra time in the closer parks? Would it be worth it to spend one night in a hotel in Jasper?   Jasper is about 3 hours away from Lake Louise by car.  If you give us a call at 1.877.902.1616 we can better understand what kind of adventure you're looking for and best recommend how to spend your time in the Rockies.

britishcolumbia,34k4ru,jawshuwah,5,Sun May 3 08:05:57 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying it's $8k/year per person, but it's actually a lot lower than that.   There are three one-time payments at various stages of the start of the project totaling $27,848,000, which works out to about $7,735.56 per person for a population of 3600. That's a ONE-TIME payment.   The ANNUAL payment is $12,924,000, and it appears to increase annually to roughly match inflation but is NOT tied to inflation (meaning that if there is greater than current inflation, the amount of money they get decreases).  So the annual payment works out to $3,590/year per person, assuming we don't get an increase in inflation.   Is $3,590 worth it? I guess we'll see. That's also assuming the money would be distributed equally, and that the population doesn't increase. With a slight stratification of $ distribution, a slight increase in inflation, and a normal population growth (29% FN average from 1996-2006 according to Stats Can), band members could be seeing less than $1k-$2k per year each, at best.   http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-558/p15-eng.cfm"

And the BCTF was a huge supporter of mainstreaming special needs and even mentions so ""The BCTF supports the principles of equity and opportunity for all learners, and the concept of inclusion...""  “Inclusion is the value system which holds that all students are entitled to equitable access to learning, achievement and the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of their education. The practice of inclusion transcends the idea of physical location, and incorporates basic values that promote participation, friendship and interaction.”  They fought for inclusion because they recognized that this could be the best way to support these students. However this is a much more complex issue. Heck keeping extra smart students in ""main stream"" can be harmful to those students as it can hold them back. I have seen first hand the benefits of mainstreaming and the detriments of it too. I have seen ESL students buddied up with a native speaker and they learned English and adapted into the class much faster then they would have if they were pushed aside. Some children with autism and downs can be great co-learners with a class room with a support worker that is equally as great to allow the teacher to keep the class learning. The benefit is that the children learn to respect and not fear or make fun of these children.  Get the wrong child with a bad case of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) into a class room and they can be nothing but a distraction no matter what they do. Trust me I shared a locker with someone with FAS and it tested me....  And how can you say I don't know much about the issue? Do you know me? Do you know what I know or what I have experienced? I have not claimed once you don't know what you are talking about. I just pointing out facts to you.  And the only way you can disprove my facts are claiming that the judges were paid off. I have more respect for our legal system. If it was able to be paid off we would have pipe lines, First Nation rights would be wiped out and who knows what else. One of the few good things about our system of law and government is that it actually works with in the laws of our Dominion.  So you call me laughable? Show me some evidence that the BCTF didn't ever support the concept of mainstreaming and inclusion of special needs. Show me evidence that our supreme court judges were paid off.   Or maybe realize that perhaps this once the BCTF is wrong. And perhaps they are lucky the government is not suing them for their legal costs that could have been used for education. Those multi-millions of dollars would do our system a world of good."

britishcolumbia,34f558,CanadianLatitude,-2,Sun May 3 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"I do have some sympathy for teachers contending with larger classes and mix of students that includes ESL and special needs, but at the end of the day the province is the employer here - and no employer can let employees set their own wages, benefits, workload (e.g. class sizes), etc.   Teachers are free to quit or to move to other provinces to teach, but I'm guessing that none of them will. It's still a good job with better than average wages, amazing benefits, enviable job security, and holidays that no other profession can match."
britishcolumbia,34f558,hobbitlover,13,Thu Apr 30 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"I think the point wasn't employees setting their own wages etc., but rather them negotiating minimum working conditions with the employer in exchange for other concessions, only to find what they had negotiated gets summarily taken away by legislation."
britishcolumbia,34f558,rbridson,-7,Thu Apr 30 23:15:53 2015 UTC,"What the teachers were asking for was impractical and had huge budget implications, and contracts get renogitiated all the time.  And what you call negotiations, some parents and students might call blackmail - threatening to shut down the education system if they don't get what they want, and accusing the province of not caring about kids if they don't give into every demand.   If British Columbians felt the province was off base in their negotiations, why has the Liberal Party been re-elected three times since 2002?  The reality is that classroom size restrictions are impractical. You don't get a predictable number of students every year for every class, and drawing a line in the sand doesn't work because you end up having to hire another full-time teacher if you go just one student over. Rural school boards wouldn't be able to afford it, forced busines would mandated in urban areas, schools would be shut down, there would be more split grades and classrooms, etc.  My own view is that teachers should be paid based on the number of students they have in their classroom - a set wage based on the first 23 kids, pegged to seniority and qualifications, and tied to inflation. For every kid over 23, they should get more money because it's more work. They should also get extra pay for ESL and Special Needs students that don't have a teaching aid."
britishcolumbia,34f558,hobbitlover,11,Fri May 1 04:57:48 2015 UTC,"If it was impractical to ask for class size and composition limits, why did the government sign an agreement to those limits?"
britishcolumbia,34f558,canadianpastafarian,5,Fri May 1 05:28:43 2015 UTC,"Because they knew they could legislate it away, and figured they'd get away with it one way or another?"

No out-of-the-box solutions were proposed, and if they were and the teachers agreed to them, the government would have still reneged on that agreement like they did on this one."
britishcolumbia,34f558,greenknight,11,Fri May 1 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"the job security is somewhat of a myth.  Until a teacher had ~7 years of seniority, they are laid off at the end of each school year.  They then get to apply for jobs for the next year, creating a situation where you are moving around from school to school.  It's a tough spot for newish teachers to pack up their classroom, and move it to a new room.  It also means that you don't teach the same grade, meaning you need to plan for new grades.  Each grade requires very different things planned for it."

If not worth the hassle call Sidney Taxi from the courtesy phone in terminal or 250-656-6666. Bus is $2.50 each. Cab will be closer to $20.

It's a hell of a drive out there and I have no idea how well you'd be received if you just showed up. My best guess would be that the road has a gate somewhere before the town, and there would be a caretaker on site. I'd image the caretaker would be one of two types: Happy to have a visitor and more than willing to chat and show you around, or reclusive and resentful of your presence.

Living in a city will give you that access but not everyone can move to the city and this province needs people to live in rural communities.  Agriculture, renewable and non renewable resource industries all require access to a rural workforce to some degree or another.  The issue should be ""Will raising the cost for school bus transportation withhold access to basic public education to any members of that community"".  Sounds like options will be in place for low income families.  Besides, I've heard of suburban Albertan parents having to spend several hundred dollars on bus services."

Rural property taxes < Urban Property taxes  I am making the point that billing rural people for maintain the infrastructure for them is nonsensical in a place with population densities in Canada is stupid, especially when it is business interests that actually ""need"" the infrastructure.  Urban population centers are required to subsidise rural, due to wages and # of tax payers. It happen with our telco service, our power and pretty much everything else... look at BC ferries and which runs make $ and which hemmorage it."
britishcolumbia,348t4j,Dirkef88,1 point,Fri May 1 16:20:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misread your response earlier to me about property taxes, edited my comments above.   I am making the point that billing rural people for maintain the infrastructure for them is nonsensical in a place with population densities in Canada is stupid, especially when it is business interests that actually ""need"" the infrastructure.   Rural infrastructure is heavily subsidized by those of us who don't live rurally, but it's still more costly to maintain some forms of rural infrastructure as opposed to the urban equivalent. If you have bus service that needs to travel 100 km every day to and from a school for just 15 kids in a rural area, it's not nearly as economical as it is in a more densely populated urban area, for instance.  And it's not just businesses that need the complex urban infrastructure we have, for example, down in Vancouver. Many citizens need it. And businesses are composed of those citizens, people like you and me.  My original point really is, if you want to live far away from the center of activity, be prepared to be put out with the simplest of things like bus service."
britishcolumbia,348t4j,alphawolf29,2,Fri May 1 16:38:19 2015 UTC,that's fucking bullshit. Schooling needs to be a basic service equally available to the poor. This is like 7% of the wages of someone earning minimum wage.

britishcolumbia,343h81,hansnpunkt,6,Fri May 1 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"I don't do a lot of biking myself, have tried the downhill trails at whistler, but thats it.  So I'll just mention what cities you should visit. You can find areas to bike in most any city we have.  Assuming you are arriving at vancouver airport in richmond, i would head up to whistler mountain.  Vancouver to whistler: Its about 2.5 hr drive from the airport. Whistler is full of a shit ton of aussies who work at the pubs restaurants and shops.  Tonnes of shopping and places to walk around. Also good biking trails between about 5-6 different lakes. Lost lake and rainbow lake we visit. Downhill biking also on the mountains.  Might want to spend 3-4 nights here. We use the summit lodge for decent price, pan pacific is expensive but nice.  Whistler to kamloops:  Its about a 4hr drive. You could stop at Lillooet for lunch. Not a huge fan of kamloops as it has rivers as opposed to lakes. The local mountain sun peaks you could check out for biking.   Kamloops to okanagan valley:  Perhaps book 2-3 nights in each city.  Probably less than a 2 hr drive from kamloops to Vernon. We like vernon as it has 3 lakes. Nice pubs, shitty nightclub, shitty stripclub, and casino. I like the feel of this town. There is the local mountain Silverstar you can check out. The best western in vernon has a very cool indoor rainforest area.  Drive south down the valley and stop next in kelowna. 1hr drive.  Kelowna is the biggest city in the valley, 100,000 ppl. I don't like it myself, and feel its one big traffic jam. But does have nicer nightclubs, strip clubs, and shopping and restaurants. We do enjoy skiing in the winter at the local mountain big white.   Stop next in penticton.  1hr drive or so. My favorite city for summer vacations. Nicest beaches in the valley. Smaller city, 35,000 or so people. Casino, shitty nightclub, nice spot on the water called the barking parrot. Local mountain is apex. Grab any old motel on okanagan beach or skaha beach.  Drive down next to Osoyoos. About 1hr drive. Warmest lake in Canada. Very nice family vacation spot and water sports. Small town 4000 people or so.  Then you would likely choose between heading further east to towns like trail, Creston, and nelson. But since your trip is limited, I would head back towards vancouver and take the ferry to vancouver island.  Osoyoos to Vancouver 5hr drive.  You might want to do this drive and jump right on the ferry from tsawwassen to Victoria.  2hr ferry ride. That's personally what I would do.   The ferries are run by the government, but a huge ripoff. Return trip for a vehicle and 2 adults is about $200. I wouldn't miss the island though, so pay the price.  If thats too long of a day, you could stop halfway from osoyoos at harrison lake for a night. Cultus lake is very nice too, with a beach and waterslides. Both are nice lakes for kayaking.  Victoria: Very cool city. Unique pubs downtown. We always stay at the strathcona hotel. Rooftop volleyball and pub open in the summer. With a pub and nightclub downstirs. Great location hotel. Spend 2-3 days in victoria.  You could head to tofino next if you guys are the surfer hippy types. Wife and I are more nightclub partiers, so tofino isn't our thing.   Or you could drive north through Duncan, boring town.  I would spend a night in parksville. Nice beaches, small summer town.  Drive north, skip nanaimo, and spend a night in courtney or comox. We often just drive past both to Campbell River. 2hr drive.  Campbell River is a smaller city, about 35,000 people. Very beautiful. Stay at the coast discovery right downtown. Nice local shops to check out. It is a fishing and logging town, so rougher type of people.  But cool pubs. The royal coachman is fun. Shitty nightclub, and shitty rough stripclub. Lots of native aboriginals too in this city, so be a bit careful at night. Spend a few nights here.  I would probably then head back down the island and ferry back to tsawwassen from nanaimo. Easier than driving further back to victoria to ferry back.  Spend whatever time you have left around vancouver.  Downtown vancouver is very cool but hotels cost a fortune in the summer.   I can probably get you a deal somewhere.  Locally in vancouver check out stanley park, granville island, downtown shops, kits beach or english bay. Spend a day going to each place. Nightlife is on granville street downtown, yaletown, and in gastown. Club people and young kids on granville street. Yuppies and hipsters in yaletown. Neckbeards and hipsters in gastown. Pick your crowd.  Tsawwassen in a nice suburb. Centennial beach is nice.  Steveston village in richmond is an old fishing village with cool shops and pubs."

If you've got a good idea of where you're biking and where you'll be taking a break someone could start suggesting things, but this is a big province and without any information on your route all I can say is look the area you're going to be online and read for yourself.   That said, if you're going to be in the southern interior you should try some Doukhobor food in Grand Forks or Trail because it's ridiculous how good and rich it is. It will sit in your gut for the rest of the day and it is glorious.   I don't mean to sound like a dick about it, it's just that BC is a big place with deserts, rainforests, mountain ranges, and all sorts of sights so without much effort you'll probably find something to keep you busy, but it's impossible to guide you to something cool if you're half the province away."

britishcolumbia,33t9pt,RichterFry,5,Sat Apr 25 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"You're looking at the Fraser Valley then or basically, anything on the other side of the Fraser River from Vancouver. In order of distance from Vancouver: Surrey, Langley, Abbotsford, Chilliwack (let'scall this the SLAC) and in a different direction Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, Mission (PMM).   In terms of cost of living, housing gets marginally cheaper the farther you go, but it's still not cheap compared to the rest of Canada (it does get a little more reasonable around Chilliwack and beyond, but the towns and work opportunities get smaller and smaller). If you want to commute into Vancouver Surrey has the best transit options by far.  On the PMM side, there is a train that goes from Mission through Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows into Vancouver. It's fairly expensive, but a nice commute - I did it for two years.  The thing about Vancouver is that it's difficult to get to because of the infrastructure. They have built some new bridges, which has helped, but they've tolled them. So there are only a couple of ways in now that aren't going to cost you more than the gas or the price of transit. There are cities that are closer to Van that you don't need a bridge and are serviced better by transit, but they are expensive in terms of housing (Port Moody, Coquitlam, Burnaby).  I live in Abbotsford and I'm currently commuting in the other direction to Agassiz. LikeI said earlier, I have commuted into Vancouver via train from Mission (very close to Abbotsford). It wasn't too bad.   I hope I answered some of your questions."

If you have been working for 5 consecutive years with the company, then you are required by law to be provided with either 5 weeks notice and/or pay (any combination thereof is legal, as long as it adds up to the full 5 weeks) in the case of termination. The only way for them to avoid this is by proving termination for just cause, which involves a serious act (theft, fraud, harassment, etc) or a much more drawn out process for unsatisfactory performance.  Otherwise I'm not really sure in what way you have been disciplined. Simply saying ""you are on probation"" has no real meaning or effect. Is there more to this story?

HR will be able to help sort it out. But the ""3 month probation"" thing (as long as the only scenario/result is the stuff in my original post) is a moot point. You shouldn't be in any immediate danger of losing your job either. A written warning must include detailed information which is outlined in the Just Cause link before it would be considered kosher by the labour board. They have very strict standards when it comes to terminations.  And next time, make sure you understand what you are signing before you sign it, and if you have any questions/issues, talk to someone right away, not after 2 weeks. Also, it might be worth documenting everything that happens to you. That way if (unfortunately) it does end up being something that goes before a labour board/court, you have a timeline of events and a paper trail. When you talk to HR, make sure to ask questions, and don't be argumentative. It may feel unfair, but she may also be completely within her rights to write you up. Don't bring your personal feelings into it, only bring in the facts. And please do not take anything I've said here as fact. Only information from a lawyer, the labour board or HR counts.

britishcolumbia,32p1lq,frozenfire,2,Wed Apr 15 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard this argument before, and it's spurious. There are many kinds of people out there whose productivity is low for a number of different reasons. Advanced age, disability, inexperience, and lack of basic skills are just a few I could name. If minimum wage is set at a level that guarantees that all workers must be able to live comfortably, then these people won't find work, plain and simple.   My wife and I have run a dog grooming shop for almost 20 years now. There are low barriers to entry for the industry, which means we can hire most of these people, and provide them with an opportunity to gain basic work experience, improve the areas of their deficiencies, and earn a glowing letter of reference for when they are able to find a higher-paying job.   Alternatively, we can (and have done many times) provide what is essentially an apprenticeship for those who are interested in becoming groomers--providing free on-the-job training and the potential for much higher wages if they work out.   None of that would be possible with a $15/hour starting wage. At that rate of pay, all potential candidates for employment would have to come to us pre-trained and already highly productive. A high minimum wage would thus drastically reduce the pool of workers we could employ would absolutely, without question, leave many people out of work overall.   Don't get me wrong. We're not minimum wage employers, and I'm not opposed to the current minimum wage, nor the planned annual indexing. But a drastic increase (like to $15/hr) would sink our business for sure, definitely hundreds more in the lower mainland alone, and leave thousands of people out of work."
britishcolumbia,32p1lq,William_Harzia,11,Thu Apr 16 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"The I can't afford it argument doesn't hold water either.  It's a level playing field if minimum wage is increased.  Everyone has to play by those rules.  Prices may have to come up.  Here's something which may not be popular here.  I think a maximum wage would be more beneficial.  When a CEO is making 300 times what the workers are making, that is what drives inequality.  I think something like a maximum gap would benefit everyone (except CEOs) much more.  And then better than that idea is to for worker owned cooperatives.  It works really well for a lot of companies.

britishcolumbia,32p1lq,zoobox,7,Wed Apr 15 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"Bullshit, B.C. is not self-sustaining economy that sources and sells all products and services within the province.  Not all companies in British Columbia exist to sell services and products to British Columbians citizens.  Many businesses in British Columbia, often sell to other companies in other provinces, and other countries.  If a company must raise their prices, unfortunately for them, the field they play on is much bigger, and they may have a hard time making profit, since they can not increase their prices for contracts they already have, nor can they afford to increase their prices and stay competitive in their industry.  Even if they don't have to increase their wages, or can afford to do so, any company who sources materials from British Columbia may find their production costs go up, if they are forced to continue to buy from those suppliers.  If a company can not afford to offer their products, at least, at the same price as before, then their business is going to take a beating.  The only solutions are really to downsize the workforce, find suppliers outside of B.C. for their materials, who can offer their products at a more competitive price, or find new customers willing to pay the new price of their product.  If you are also a fan of buy local/source local, you're going to be an unhappy camper."

I think they could definitely afford to pay me a few bucks an hour more.

britishcolumbia,32p1lq,sndwsn,6,Thu Apr 16 06:11:53 2015 UTC,"Here's an interesting report from Ontatio regarding minimum wage.  I'll direct you to sections 3.1, under ""Impact of minimum wages on poverty"" on page 36   Given what we know about the demographic profile of people working at minimum wages, it is not surprising that the overlap between working at the minimum wage and being under the poverty line is small. Only about 12.5% of minimum wage workers lived in poor households in 2011 according to Statistics Canada's Low Income Measure (LIM). The vast majority (81.5) lived in household with incomes above the LIM. (Estimates provided by the Ontario Ministry of Finance based on the Labour Force Survey). Thus, although raising the minimum wage would reduce poverty for some, its overall impact on poverty as a whole would be limited.   Emphasis added are mine.  In my mind, the campaigns to raise the minimum wage are about reducing poverty, right? The infographic of this post want me to think about the single mom working full time raising two kids on minimum wage. While there are certainly a fair number of people like that, it turns out that's more rare that you'd think. According to the source information above, 18.5% (100% - 81.5%) of minimum wage earners are living in households with incomes below the LIM.  Shouldn't the goal be to help those people, not the 81.5% of minimum wage workers who are not living in poverty? There are better ways to help those in poverty than increasing the minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage is a great political talking point, because it's easy to understand, but look at the last line of the quote.    ""Although raising the minimum wage would reduce poverty for some, its overall impact on poverty as a whole would be limited""   Increase the working income tax benefit, increase G/HST rebate cheques, or do any number of other things designed to get money into the hands of low income households. Don't enact a policy that doesn't effectively target the group who needs it the most."

A surprising amount of people for various reasons either treat the tip as a joke, don't tip on alcohol, or don't tip at all. No matter what they tip I still need to 'tip out' the bartenders, bussers, hostess etc about 6% of total sales. So if someone doesn't tip or tips low I have to 'tip out' from my own pocket. Servers also usually only work for 3-4 hrs at a time during a lunch or dinner so its difficult to have a steady income when one day you make $15 for 3 hrs shift one day but then the next it's $10.5 for a 4hr shift.

britishcolumbia,32p1lq,TheGuyWhoLikesPies,5,Thu Apr 16 00:24:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you. If you make lets say, $11.50 an hour right now which is just over $1 above minimum, then if we raised the min. wage to $15/hr then your wage would also go up to $15/hr and you would make more money. You wouldn't be making above minimum but you would have increased spending power regardless. The economy as a whole would benefit. If you feel your job is worth 16+ an hour you could ask for a raise. If you don't get it, leave. If min. wage is $15/hr and the job is considered slightly above the min. wage pay grade it will get raised because they won't find anyone whos decent and reliable to fill the position at min. wage.  Further, minimum wage doesn't increase the cost of living. Our cost of living (food et al) goes up all the time due to many factors, one being inflation. The minimum wage does not go up along with it. It should. It doesn't. I'm sick and tired of that long debunked argument, ""min wage will increase cost of living!!!111"". No. Not directly. The cost of living is going up all the time because of economic factors, least of all being the minimum wage. The increase you see from min. wage is well, minimal at best. Mcdonalds having to charge 4 more cents for a burger really does not bother me. The price of food has been going up constantly for years. Minimum wage has not been.  Minimum wage needs an adjustment."
britishcolumbia,32p1lq,Dr__House,5,Wed Apr 15 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"Upvoted for good constructive criticism. Consider the reality of making $23 an hour right now. How much did that very same job pay 15 years ago? You are inferring that minimum wage is the primary driver of rising costs, when in reality its supply and demand. Minimum wage is involved in product costs because many of these companies use minimum wage workers but its not as much as you think.  I do agree that suddenly raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour here would be a shock to the economy but I'm not an economist and I would be much more interested in what they have to say about this subject. I think raising it on a scale over a few years might work. I also think that something like $12/hour would be good right now for minimum wage. From what I've gathered, the $15/hour number comes from adjusting for the spending power someone whom worked minimum wage had 40-50 years ago.  In another post in this thread I provided some in context links regarding many of the dire predictions of minimum wage increases, demonstrating that they don't happen or when they do they aren't nearly as severe as predicted.  I live on Vancouver Island, I am affected by constantly rising food and goods costs. They are always going up and down (usually up) yet our wages remain largely steady through that process."
britishcolumbia,32p1lq,Dr__House,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"I guess my posts do come off as stating it IS ""the only factor"" when it comes to the rise of the cost of goods. I guess my statements are sensationalized a bit after re reading them. Yes I do agree it is not the the only, or even the main factor. But I do think it is a factor none the less, contributing to an overall broken situation.  I by no means think that you shouldn't be able to live a good, albeit quite comfortable life off a minimum wage job. Of course I do! Personally, I think it's the way we approach the situation that is the main issue. People think that by solely raising the minimum wage, that everyone will live a life of luxury. That's not the case and I can't stress that enough, nothing is free in this world, and throwing money on top of a broken system to begin with is just ludicrous IMHO. This money has to, and will come from somewhere else. No, I don't have the solution, as much as I wish I did. And this is somewhat defeatist, but even if I did no one who mattered would listen. I just know that this isn't going to fix anything in the long run because we'll be right back here in another 5 years."
britishcolumbia,32p1lq,4rkless,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:38:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that it drives up costs locally.  This makes everything cost more for everyone.  Everyone has the freedom to choose where they work.  Many businesses start people at a minimum wage until workers complete training and then increase their wage as the worker progresses.  An increase in the minimum wage decreases the incentive for an employer to invest in a new worker.  It increases their chances of looking for other options which could include outsourcing to somewhere with much lower wages, automating tasks, or simply not growing their staff.  If you're not happy with what you're getting paid, why not ask your boss what you need to do to reach your ideal wage?"

britishcolumbia,32p1lq,dripdroponmytiptop,2,Wed Apr 15 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, that's not constructive either. I can understand both perspectives, having been on both sides of it.  Employees need to work and are unfortunately put in the position of not making a living wage due to poor minimum wage laws. Employers are struggling to keep up with their costs, and don't see how they could take the hit of a sudden increase in labour costs.  The smart employers will get ahead of it by taking the hit on their own terms when they can dictate how/when it happens, and the smart employees will gravitate towards companies willing to do that.  But, unfortunately, not everyone is going to have that foresight, in a ""can't see the forest for the trees"" sort of way. Both the employers and the employees are playing catch-up, living on their short-term income (""paycheque to paycheque"")."
britishcolumbia,32p1lq,frozenfire,2,Wed Apr 15 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"if there is an employer who blames their inability to pay their workers on a wage increase, instead of literally any other problem, they're running a shit show. Employers who say that raising minimum wage will hurt the employees, that's a giant flashing red sign that says they will blame whatever they fucking can on you. Fuck those employers."
britishcolumbia,32p1lq,dripdroponmytiptop,3,Thu Apr 16 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"Labour costs are huge, especially for small and medium companies.  The problem people often overlook is that some types of work are simply not worth $15/hr.  When that is the case, the work has to be contracted out, or other employees have to pick up the slack.  A small company has to have very high revenues in order to afford a new employee.  A company focused strictly on the health of their business would opt to layoff unnecessary labour, or refuse to hire, and make other employees pick up the slack, in order to maintain the health of their business.  When it costs $26,250, plus any insurance, and benefits, to be able to afford an employee for $35hr/week with two weeks vacation, that is quite a considerable sum of money for a small company with small revenues.  If your company's revenue is in the hundreds of thousands, the cost of a minimum wage employee better be worth it, otherwise your profit margin will go from healthy, or ugh oh.  Not every employer is looking to squeeze all the juice they can out of the company to make the numbers look good, many genuinely have financial trouble justifying certain jobs when wages increase.  Plus, many small companies do not sell to the general public; they sell to other businesses, in other provinces, and other countries, who expect the price of their product/service to remain the same, or become cheaper.  So the whole, ""increased wages means people will be able to afford the more expensive product,"" only applies to very specific types of businesses.  I am sure the company you sell your brushless electric motors too, is not going to care about your financial situation, Company Y can now undercut your prices, and you lose a contract, losing even more money, forcing you to make further changes to your business.  Unfortunately for those companies, they go from a comfortable position, to a more difficult position, when it comes to operating finances.  Let's keep in mind though, that there are a ton of different factors which can have the same negative effects on a small business.  Anytime the cost of business increases, businesses are forced to react.  Unfortunately, reduction in labour costs is one means by which a company can help correct those problems.  The whole adage, ""you have to spend money to make money,"" only really makes sense when there is some benefit to operating in larger volumes, not simply paying more for the same thing.  It is great for employees who can maintain their positions at their company, but not so great for employees who lose their job, or now have a much harder time finding employment because their current job skills are not worth what companies are now forced to pay.  Best to get rid of minimum wage completely, and have unions negotiate industry-wide wages and salaries, like they do in Germany, and Scandinavia."

We gross around a half million per year and are probably the most successful business in our industry in the province. Nonetheless an increase in min wage to $15/hour would basically sink us. With 9 employees, bringing them all up to 15 would cost us around $40 000 extra per year.  To make up for that we could:   raise our prices and watch our income drop take a giant personal paycut and watch our dreams evaporate fire half our staff and downsize to a smaller location start taking and paying cash under the table drop our group benefits plan   Probably we would have to do two or more of the above to stay in business, and I'm dead certain we're doing way better than any of our competitors.

When the HST came in, the cost to our customers increased by 7% across the board, and no joke, our gross the following year dropped by almost exactly 7%.   A lot of this talk regarding dramatic increases of the min wage seem to be predicated on the idea that all that extra cash is already there, hiding somewhere in the company finances, and simply needs to be redirected to staff.

britishcolumbia,32qohs,JayEmBosch,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"From the Friends of Nicola Valley Facebook:   This group is concerned with the use of sewage sludge,, AKA Bio Waste, Bio Solids, Food Waste Compost and Class A or B Compost, all names given to the product derived from sewage treatment of community waste water.   This concern involves the recent contract that have been given to persons in the sewage sludge industry, bringing tons of sewage to the area of Merritt, B.C. The sewage sludge a.k.a. Bio Waste is coming to this location from other areas of B.C.  The issue as we see it is:   One of the properties is directly up hill and behind a 44 lot subdivision that derives its drinking water from an Aquifer originating from the property that has been permitted to spread and store sludge. Concern for run off of heavy metal, e coli, hormone and chemical contaminated water into the subdivision and into other water courses, namely the Nicola River (a salmon spawning habitat), as well as productive farmland in the Nicola Valley. Potential hazardous/toxic waste to be accidentally spilled onto properties during the winter months. Airborne contaminants from stock-piled Bio-waste. Local farmers being talked into taking this product as it is free, and running the risk of contaminating their soil, and harming their livelihood and health of their families. The fact that the economic downturn for the entire area will be strongly felt by having the presence of this waste become the focal point of the Merritt area. Areas known to have toxic waste dumps are severely affected by the lack of investor confidence and risk factors associated with “contamination issues”."
britishcolumbia,32qe4b,feathergnomes,3,Wed Apr 15 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"As for why:   BC has an outdated funding model that makes it difficult to practice good medicine. You make more money doing walk in clinics. Doctors these days want to work less and see fewer patients. New grads are swimming in six figure debt so most will locum (substitute doctor) for a while. There is reluctance to open practices because it's a costly endeavour. Most will eventually opt to join a shared practice with multiple doctors, but these group practices tend to be lower volume than the traditional sole practitioner. Tuition alone is nearly $20,000 a year for medical school. Before the tuition freeze was put to an end in the early 2000s, medical students were paying $2000-$4000. Due to the long training time, any changes in medical school and residency spots take years to decades to affect the status quo. In the early 1990s, decision makers thought there was going to be a physician surplus so they cut enrolment which turned out to be a terrible move.  They've increased medical school spots (via Kelowna site) several years ago but the effects won't be seen so soon, especially since they haven't really increased residency spots concurrently. I know of some classmates that did not get a residency spot (not just locally but across Canada) and they applied solely and broadly to family medicine."
britishcolumbia,32qe4b,hklemontea,2,Thu Apr 16 00:03:22 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to believe your last paragraph. I'm too lazy to look up the CARMs reports for the last few years, but I'd think the vast majority of applicants who are applying to only FM programs, geographically broadly, ranking all the FM programs, and who are ""reasonable"" applicants wouldn't have a problem matching in the first iteration.  There are usually unmatched FM spots for CMGs after the first iteration.   I'm guessing maybe they applied broadly, interviewed broadly, but then didn't CARMS rank all the programs."
britishcolumbia,32qe4b,seanboddity,2,Sat Apr 25 14:36:38 2015 UTC,"Potentially but I knew of a few personally who interviewed broadly and ranked broadly but did not match. Maybe they had red flags or didn't interview well but they seemed like competent, caring and capable people.  The decrease in residency spots to med student ratio was anticipated. Heard from a few UBC Year 4 faculty committee members that they were worried more people would go unmatched. Since it was out of their control, they basically wanted to see what happens. UBC as a whole didn't do too badly but I heard anecdotally that the other schools had higher unmatched rates after the first round. Will be interesting to see what the official stats show.  Many of the unmatched FM spots are in French programs or they're shadow spots reserved for IMG and other 2nd iteration applicants."
britishcolumbia,32qe4b,hklemontea,2,Sat Apr 25 19:15:15 2015 UTC,"This is from last year which is before the 32 student Kelowna expansion:   Choice of Family Medicine is at an all-time high. 38.2 per cent of all CMGs selected acareer in Family Medicineas their first choice.   Despite these positive statistics, the 2014 R-1 match saw an increase in the number of unmatched graduating students. CaRMS will be analyzing the application and ranking patterns of the unmatched students to better understand their career pathways, and will share these results with student affairs offices and faculties of medicine to assist and support their career counseling initiatives.   Out of the 154 unmatched applicants after Round 1, these were the top 3 disciplines of choice:   50 chose a surgical discipline as their first choice. 34 chose family medicine as their first choice. 14 chose anesthesiology as their first choice.   http://www.carms.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-By-The-Numbers-En.jpg"
britishcolumbia,32qe4b,hklemontea,2,Sat Apr 25 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for finding some data! So 39 first choice FM residents went unmatched in Round 1, and 1488 FM matches were made.  That's a pretty low proportion of unmatched docs, considering some of those might match in the second round, anyways.  I'm not sure unmatched FM residents are the source of the shortage.  I think my broader point is that residents aren't going unmatched because of lack of spots. We need to make more (quality) spots AND convince more medical graduates to consider FM as their first choice. I think we've all heard stories of specialists taking additional fellowships because they can't find a staff position. Less urologists, more FM docs.  If you think about it, less than 40% of residents are first choice FM. I know there are lots of guys gunning for a specialty who semi-happily match to FM as a 2nd/3rd rank, but seriously - we need to incentivize docs to choose a career in FM.  That number should easily be 50% or 60%.  That's the conversation.  Then we need to transition these docs out of training and support them in getting started into whatever FM career they want.  Cutting them loose with $200k of student debt and then having them contemplate $300-500k of additional debt to start up a practice is not an appealing transition.  No wonder they locum and kick tires for a while instead of giving 1000 people the new family doc they've been looking for."

In about 10 years in Vancouver I saw very little, beyond the usual below-30-year-olds dropping n-bombs to try and be funny.  Saw quite a bit of racist behaviour on Vancouver Island too.  At least in my personal experience, the cities are the most accustomed to diversity and the most accepting, but your mileage may vary.  Remember for every ignorant racist you encounter, there are many many more Canadians who are caring and welcoming."

In Van, it's almost like people are too comfortable with other races, to the point where it can come off a little thoughtless (I'm guilty of this with my Asian and East Indian buddies).  BUT! When you come to the Peace you might as well be in a whole new world. To be fair, even when people up here are trying to be sensitive, they just don't have experience interacting with a lot of other cultures. FSJ is limited to the TFWs working at Walmart, the few international students, and there's a couple of Sushi, Indian, and Chinese restaurants.  That being said, I haven't seen much overt racism, except maybe in the case of some dealings with First Nations. But everyone is more than wiling to learn about other cultures, from what I've seen."

Two weeks after I moved here, an old lady working at Walmart called my baby a ""nigger in a woodpile"" because her hair is blond and curly and my husband's is dark and straight. Last week I was making conversation with a salesperson and they casually said that Filipinos are stealing all the jobs from ""real Canadians.""

I am going to be very honest and blunt.   Living North of Kamloops or anywhere rural is much different than the Lower Mainland, Okanagan or Southern Vancouver Island.  There is racism towards First Nations. There is poverty in areas that should not exist in a civilized country (this applies to all of Canada). There is (justifiable) hostility that you feel when you walk through a First Nations neighbourhood as a white person and when you grow up with it, things get racist. That being said, I know and am friends with many First Nations people who are hard working, good people. In my experience as eager as people are to shit on a First Nations person who is down and out, they are just as eager to like them if they are a good person. I guess what I am trying to say is that it seems like First Nations people are more likely to be judged,  positively or negatively, than white people.  There are a lot of native people working in forestry. Trust me, you will become a fan favourite with both us honkeys and the natives up there as long as you have thick skin.

I feel like that is why it is so wide spread too, there isn't the same violence associated with it, so there is no active attempt to mitigate it.  edit: Just to be clear, I think overall people are nicer and more considerate as a whole so the bar of what I consider 'normal' politeness and consideration in Canada is higher than the US, reading it again my initial statement sounds artificially dire. I think one is semi-likely to get a distasteful look but it is more likely a rude comment would be made in private, not to your face.

This is what cultural genocide does, and it doesn't wear off in a generation or two. I try to explain this to people who are racist towards First Nations people out of ignorance.

britishcolumbia,32asqd,sowhatnoweh,4,Sun Apr 12 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"Born and raised in a small town in the interior, living in Kamloops now. I never got the impression my community was all that racist. Now granted I was a kid but we had plenty of visible minorities living in a tiny community and I never heard of or saw any incidents. I reckon you'll be fine, attach yourself to a good crowd, the right people, and things will be fine. Can't beat interior living for the weather and outdoor recreation."
britishcolumbia,32asqd,nrtphotos,5,Sun Apr 12 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"Having grown up in a real small town (pop. ~2000) in the interior of BC that was approximately 50% Native, I can definitely say that I saw my fare share of racism both towards Natives and from them towards white people. However, this was more the exception to the general behaviour in he community. For the most part, people got along just fine with each other regardless of skin colour. Small towns can be a very friendly and supportive place.   Despite this though, there was definitely always a bit of underlying tension between the two peoples. As has been reiterated previously, most of the grandparents and parents of the community had been subjugated to the horrors of residential schools when growing up, which has really had a circular effect on both how they act, and how they are viewed by white Canadians. The stereotype of drug and alcohol abuse has its roots in truth, but most people who look down on this sort of behaviour fail to see that in many cases this has been spawned by the atrocities that many of them experienced growing up. Can you honestly say that you could be taken from your families as a small child, being beaten for trying to express your own culture, and often raped by the priests who ran the schools, without becoming a little messed up? It's no surprise that many find solace in a bottle.   On top of that, there are often disagreements over land use between the local bands and other industries such as BC Hydro, mining, or logging companies. This causes some resentment among people who see this as impeding work and progress, though the Natives mostly see it as protecting the last of the land that they have claim to from the being abused by ""the government"" and other ""greedy corporations"". That being said, the Natives often had real concerns about protecting the environment and nature from being damaged. This and more has created at least some level of resentment or mistrust between the two peoples, leading to the unfortunate inevitability of racism. That being said, there isn't a lot of hate among people, more just the clash of differing cultures and annoyance or anger at specific incidences that get blanketed over the entire people.  It's a very complex situation, though after travelling through the prairies and getting to know people in other provinces I can say without a doubt that relations with Natives here in BC are one hell of a lot better than elsewhere in Canada.   Should you move to a small town (though I would consider most of the ""small towns"" you listed to be not very small) you will definitely encounter racism, whether it be confusing you with being Native or otherwise. That being said, there will be many more people who will gladly welcome you into the community with smiles and open arms (and hopefully baked goods).  Anyways, that's my 2 cents. I think I rambled a little, but I hope this helped give you a little more info. Cheers, and best of luck with university!"

britishcolumbia,32asqd,nrtphotos,8,Sun Apr 12 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"First nations people were forced into abusive residential schools across Canada. It was meant to wipe out their culture, language, religion and more. The abuse was neglect, deprivation, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and psychological abuse. These children were torn from their families and given english names like ""John"" and forbidden from speaking their language of origin. These people are the elders of the first nations people. There are significant social and economic issues as a result including heavy substance abuse issues, educational issues and serious problems with violence within their communities. The whole thing really marginalizes them further as they are often associated with drugs,excessive drinking, poverty, crime, and trashed looking reserves. Ignorant, irrational and angry non first nations people tend to have a negative and racist view on them. It is really easy to judge when people dont bother to consider what these people face."

NOAA's assessment of the type of fuel spilled is that it's one of the most persistent types of oil, and may be undetectable by sight or remote sensing equipment. It can do anything from float, sit below the surface, or sink, and sinking gets more likely when it washes onto beaches.  A spill of bunker fuel halfway down the coast of Washington state in late 1988 travelled beneath the surface and washed ashore in Victoria and the Lower Mainland coast in early 1989  Our primary response organization is owned by 5 oil companies, 4 of them are demonstrably irresponsible in their clean-up efforts.

britishcolumbia,31wi9d,CDN_Rattus,10,Wed Apr 8 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"For those looking for a summary:   Under the proposed plan, disputing a notice is a three-part process.  Initially, adjudication officers with the superintendent of motor vehicles provide an opportunity for drivers to plead guilty.  “They can offer you incentives to plead guilty, a fine reduction or giving you time to pay,” Lee explained. “It’s designed at the first instance to goad people into pleading guilty by giving them an incentive to do so. If you don’t do that, then you get to go to a hearing before the Driving Notice Review Board. That can be in any manner: it can be oral, it can be written, it can be in person, it can be in some kind of electronic form, or some combination of those.”  Before you have your hearing, though, Lee added, there is a pre-hearing where the accused must provide evidence.  “Now you don’t have a right to keep your defence a secret and have your witness come and have them testify that ‘he wasn’t speeding, I was in the car with him,’” Lee said. “You have to disclose all of your witnesses and your witness statements to the Crown.”  The police officer must submit his or her evidence by way of a sworn report, but if the officer who issued the driving notice can’t do it, any other officer can.  “Reading the legislation, the officer who issued the ticket isn’t even required to provide evidence other than the ticket itself,” Lee said.  “It’s insane. The decision of the board in the legislation is final — you cannot appeal the decision of the board to any court and you can’t seek judicial review.”  Although traffic tickets are misdemeanours, Lee insisted the consequences can be large, ranging from significant financial penalties and lengthy driving prohibitions to the forfeiture of a vehicle.  What the government is doing is trying to eliminate the ability of people to defend themselves, Lee maintained."

Easter Sunday marks his resurrection.  Now, he may have been a hard worker, his earthly father was a tekton (something like a carpenter or general contractor) so he would have had some early introduction to hard work as a tradesman, though from the story the first few years of his life may have been as an itinerant migrant on the run from the authorities, so it's hard to know for certain and from the records most of his adult life was as an itinerant philosopher living off the good graces of those who believed he was The Christ, and the relatives of his band of disciples.  Eventually, after creating quite a stir, causing damage in a religious community centre, and spreading a message that was largely interpreted as seditious,  he was betrayed by one of his cohort, arrested and executed as a common criminal.  Now even if the comment was made with any intent to specifically avoid offending certain demographics, it really missed the point entirely and anyone of any religious leaning should really take some degree of issue with it."

britishcolumbia,31nsgm,ecclectic,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:19:32 2015 UTC,"Good Friday reminds us that hard work and sacrifice are rewarded.   How does the life and specifically the death of Jesus (particularly the horrific method in which he was executed) teach us that hard work is rewarded?  The sacrifice, I suppose there was a reward for the sacrifice, but that didn't occur until three days later, and while it may have been the direct result of the events of Good Friday, the entire thing was ordained at the birth of Christ, so the claim of self sacrifice is kind of moot in a way.  I don't hold any of these claims personally sacred, I'm just offering reasons that people could see it as offensive."

Now, Fort St. John in the winter gets cold. Or Cold. Or perhaps even COLD, depending on your tolerance. -30°C to -40° for a week isn't unheard of, and four to five months south of 0°C/32°F isn't either. You'll have to worry about heating costs in the winter, which tend to be worse than air conditioning costs in the Arizona summer. On the plus side, there are chinooks which give you a break for a day or so. And the summers do get up into the mid-20s/70s-80s, but nothing like Arizona heat.  There's a lot of nature up there, though. Camping, hunting, hiking, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing...anything like that your jam? That'll be good. Into concerts, museums, huge malls? Expect to have to go to Edmonton or Vancouver, which is a long day's drive or an expensive flight. There is some cultural things to do up there, but you have to take what you can get. And being into country music doesn't hurt.  As for beauty...sure. I mean, everywhere looks like crap in spring when all the dirty, sanded snow is melting. You're more in the foothills than the mountains up there, but it's still pretty. Only a few hours from the proper Rockies. Jasper and Banff are far too the south.  Canada, on the whole, is more liberal than the US, but the Peace River district is about as Conservative as it gets outside of Alberta. Also, the political colours are reversed, so conservative areas are blue, liberal red, and very liberal orange. :)  There will be things that you miss, and new things you love. If you're running from something, well, wherever you go, there you are. Doesn't help. Read up on culture shock, and start watching or listening to the CBC online, as it colours how we perceive the world. If you've never been to a hockey game, it's probably pretty cheap for you to see the 'Yotes in Phoenix; it's probably worth doing. Canadians pick up hockey through long exposure. Also remember stereotypes are only half-true. Sure, there are polite, pale-skinned Canadians, but there are a huge combination of people up here, including attitudes and backgrounds.  Besides that, cheers, and good luck with the paperwork if you decide to come, eh?"
britishcolumbia,31l0w4,sammersd,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I actually very much enjoy the cold. Winter in Arizona is nothing compared to winter up north; but, I love the cold. I used to live in Breckenridge, Colorado and I loved the snow and the environment. I'm not terribly worried about the cold, really, because I can always add more layers. The crappy thing about AZ is that one can always add more layers, but you can only take so many clothes off. Ugh!   ALL of the things you mentioned- minus hunting- are things I'm very interested in and/or very involved in already. I've always wanted to learn to snowboard. We have snow about two hours north of us, but if I'm LIVING in the place where snow is a thing, it makes it a bit easier to find the time to learn it, you know? And bleh, country music. At least the boyfriend likes it.   I'm really hoping to move into a more liberal area. Most conservative politics in the US are just awful. Selfish, angry, greedy- just, no thanks. I will definitely begin researching politics in the area and looking for good fits for him and I.   I'm certainly not running away from anything down here (except maybe the crappy politics). I'm hoping for a new experience, a new adventure- and, if it ends up not being our cup of tea, we just remind ourselves that it's only for a year or two (maybe three or more if we really love it).   HOCKEY IS SO MUCH FUN. In fact, hockey games are the only ones I've ever gone to and actually had a lot of fun at. So, that's great news.   Stereotypes are so funny to me. The American stereotype is that of a fat, loud, obnoxious, angry and selfishly undereducated beast- at least that's what I've heard. I'd like to have a few people who believe that meet me and my boyfriend, so that we can show them that not all Americans are 'Murikuns (lol) and some of us actually care about other humans and cultures. Here in the US, the Canadian stereotype is one of a polite, kind and helpful person- of course, I expect to run into some totally horrible human beings, because those are universal- but the nicer stereotype is pretty relieving, honestly. Hopefully within a few months I'll have molded into the culture and accents enough that people won't guess I'm an American. It's kind of sad that I'm THAT embarrassed by the antics of my fellow countrymen, but it is what it is.   Thank you so much!"

Pharmaceuticals can be either stolen from animal hospitals or made at home, with very little time, effort or expense.

A gram off the street lasts me two days, if I take it as a medicine. The dispensary bud lasts me less than a day, sometimes just a few hours. Understand that; this, for me now, is a medicine.

People get slapped out in some of these dispensaries, like it's just an alley with walls. The 'fancy' place I go to in the West End, sells the same weakened bud as the East side but for $10 a gram, not $5. My other option is to buy my 'weed' in a flap...like coke or heroin.

This is the crux of our disagreement. You take that statement to be true, without any evidence. Where is the evidence that laced weed has been sold to unsuspecting buyers? It's existence, alone, is not evidence of that. My position is that it is more likely that this product would be sold for exactly what it is (at a premium price compared to normal weed), since there's already a market for fentanyl. Or that the person who meant to consume the weed was the one who laced it.   There is no indication of what volume of weed was found to be laced with fentanyl. Are we talking about a few grams or a few kilograms? The fact that the RCMP have withheld that information is rather suspicious.

britishcolumbia,316hzm,EuphoricOnesieHugs,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:38:16 2015 UTC,"STOP! Before you enroll in post secondary schooling, ask yourself this one quick question: ""Is there a job market for the field of study I want to take?""  Look at where the jobs are right now and where they are shifting towards.  Skilled trades are in high demand.  Computer Sciences are in high demand.  Political Science degrees are not. So be sure to enroll responsibly in something with realistic job potential post schooling.  Are you just going to post secondary school because that's what mom and dad want?  Or because you don't know what you want to do with life?  Don't just run off to university because some High School counselor told you that's what you need to do or you don't know what to do next in life.   Do you want to end up being 21/22 years old, $40K in the hole, with no job prospects and a useless degree in some topic nobody cares about?  Taking a student loan means taking on debt.  Debts you will have to repay regardless of your employment status.  Once you're done school you will have to start repaying them in 6 months.  So maybe consider other options, like part time school and part time work?"

britishcolumbia,312sob,CrazyLeprechaun,7,Wed Apr 1 16:57:42 2015 UTC,"Now if we can just keep it closed, maybe employees in BC might have some value."
britishcolumbia,312sob,ApathyLincoln,2,Wed Apr 1 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"The problem is whether BC workers will actually pick up the slack, and whether employers are willing/able to actually pay them what they want. TFWs can be paid as low as 15% less than the average wage, which helps keep everyone else's wages suppressed, and they are often underpaid in their industry, which exacerbates the problem.    The results of the audit are shocking: of the 15,006 employers who were approved to bring in Temporary Foreign Workers, more than 14,500 were offering wages that were lower than what the government says these workers should be paid. The wages were below the prevailing wage rate anywhere from a few cents to $11.45 an hour too low.  “The government shouldn’t be in the business of helping employers keep wages low,” McGowan said. “If an employer is offering minimum wage, they’re clearly not trying very hard to find Canadian workers. I suspect that if they could have paid any less, they wouldn’t have hesitated.”  TFWP regulations give Minister Kenney’s department the power to deny work permits if wages offered a worker in the Program are below prevailing regional wages for that particular occupation.  “The government has the ability – and the duty – to deny these work permits. These applications clearly state the wages that employers are offering, and the government has documentation of the prevailing wage rates,” McGowan said. “The fact that they didn’t bother to cross reference applications to the appropriate wage rates is an abject dereliction of duty. It shows that there is no enforcement of the Temporary Foreign Worker program, and it shows you can’t take it at face value when Minister Jason Kenney’s talks big about a crackdown.”   And they tend to take jobs citizens don't want or won't take. I'm not certain that Canadian workers will necessarily be jumping at the chance, or that employers will be willing to fork over the extra money just to meet prevailing wages in the industry when they've gotten so used to low-balling labour."
britishcolumbia,312sob,CrazyLeprechaun,9,Wed Apr 1 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"With no other job prospects, they will probably be happy to have the chance.  Also, Canadian citizens should just automatically have preference for any job anyway.  If there isn't a qualified Canadian, then the company in question can train a Canadian to do the job."

But realistically a business will choose a cheaper option if it results in the same performance, and hiring a foreign worker with the skills is immensely cheaper than what you suggest."

Employers can pay TFW's 15% less than the AVERAGE wage, not the minimum. You can find the average wage at http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wage-outlook_search-eng.do?reportOption=wage - I can't speak for all professions, but when I was working at a hotel in Banff the 'average' wage was way higher than anyone was getting paid, and so 15% less meant it was possible to sponsor people whilst paying them the same as Canadian employees. Paying the 'average' wage would have meant that TFW's would have been paid more than Canadians.  As far as I understand it, it is never possible to pay anyone less than minimum wage, including TFW's. The article you linked to says ""Under the new rules, foreign temporary workers will still covered by provincial employment standards, meaning they must be paid the minimum wage"""

britishcolumbia,313his,infinus5,0,Thu Apr 2 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"A month-long public consultation begins today, April 1. At least one resident near the disaster site says this amounts to a cruel April Fool's prank.  ""I couldn't believe it,"" says Douglas Gook, Quesnel area forestry consultant. ""One of the problems is—I've been phoning people like crazy—yet nobody's heard about it,"" he says of tonight's meeting, hosted by Imperial Metals. ""I've signed up on all their email lists... only through other connections did I hear about this meeting.""   ...   Because the old wastewater storage pit is still broken, the company has proposed to dump tailings in an unused mining pit instead. Mines ministry spokesperson David Haslam explains if the application is successful, mining will resume at Mount Polley's ""Cariboo"" pit, and waste will be stored in the mine's ""Springer"" pit.  This is a red flag for Will Koop, coordinator of the B.C. Tap Water Alliance. ""One of the issues there is the pit is not secure,"" says Koop, who authored a 200-page report critical of the mine's engineering history, its management, and the environmental fallout since the Mount Polley disaster. Without proper lining, the wastewater could seep into local groundwater, he says.  When asked about this, Imperial Metals' VP corporate affairs Steve Robertson says, ""nobody has brought up that concern."" He says the pit is ""solid bedrock"" and the inflow of water is very slow. By keeping the tailings under 1,030 metres above sea level, he says water will flow into the pit rather than out.  As for the old tailings pond, Koop sees lasting integrity issues that can't be fixed before June. ""What's going to happen to that existing tailings storage facility?"" he asks. ""It's still holding a lot of toxic tailings—how are they going to secure that forever?""  Robertson dismisses this claim as well, adding the storage facility doesn't have any pressure inside it. ""I would say the facility has been very well examined over the last seven months and there are no questions about the stability.""  Daniels, whose background is in fisheries biology, says there's not enough research to move forward with a restart plan. He says the jury's still out on bioaccumulation of toxins in fish and animal tissue, for example. ""I personally feel we're not going to know how tailings have impacted that ecosystem for five or 10 years,"" Daniels says. ""I don't feel the science is there."" So far the company has claimed the micron-sized sediment particles aren't small enough to be absorbed by wildlife."

britishcolumbia,30vf68,Biff_Tannen___,5,Tue Mar 31 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"The Spector360 software didn't have anything to do with the affair.  Atwell phoned the Saanich Police about a confrontation over the affair, the Saanich Police leaked the 911 call to the media.  Before that happened Atwell said he had been pulled over by police 4 times, and he later said he thought they were harassing him.  Keep in mind the Saanich Police endorsed Frank Leonard during the run up to the election.  Now as for the Spector software it was installed the day after he became mayor without his knowledge, from the sound of it based on what the privacy commissioner has said it wouldn't even matter if they got permission anyway since the type of surveillance Spector provides breaks FIPPA(Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act).    The councillors and really shoddy media reporting vilified Atwell making him out to be some crazy Rob Ford like nut.   Now we know Atwell's allegations are legit, thanks to the privacy commissioner.  I think it's time to follow the bread crumbs and find out who is responsible and when they figure this out they should be fired and be criminally prosecuted.

There are different cultures in BC, but there are different cultures in Washington, and in Oregon, too, and yet there's a common feeling to the whole region, that seems to come from the commonalities in the natural environment and the broad strokes of history that shaped European settlement here.  I don't feel that kind of commonality when I visit other regions in the USA, or in other parts of Canada for that matter. I mean... the capital of the USA might as well be on a different continent. It just isn't the same kind of place at all. It doesn't feel like home and I feel very much like a tourist when I go there. Beyond that, I feel really ambivalent about the USA, and really uncomfortable with its generally imperialistic way of relating to the rest of the world. That's not me, that's not my culture, that's not anything I endorse or want to support!   But I really like the place I live, the place I call home. I love it here, I love the environment, I love the people, I love the cultures, it's a great part of the world and I am happy to sing its praises to anyone who will listen.

britishcolumbia,30mpko,Fenora,12,Sun Mar 29 00:38:50 2015 UTC,"Cascadia is built around the idea that BC, Washington, Oregon and (sometimes) Northern California share a great deal in terms of climate, social outlook, challenges and opportunities. We're also very far from the centers of power for our respective countries, so we lack clout in the current political environment. Cascadia is a way of redefining that political environment with a new regional assertion of identity.   Taken to an extreme, Cascadia would mean a new country formed out of the US Pacific Northwest and BC. This, of course, is a fringe and extremist notion.   In more practical terms, 'Cascadia' can just mean that we work together over state and national boundaries to build a cohesive  regional identity. The first goal is usually something like high-speed rail, to bind us more tightly together. After that, we work together to achieve a common agenda. For instance, we both belong to countries that are major petroleum producers, but we're not big producers ourselves. So, we work together to harness alternative sources of energy (solar, hydro, rain?)   Eventually, we create a regional power which can hold its own against other regional powers (the Southern Bible Belt, Rust Belt, Toronto Metropolitan Area (aka 905), Wall St.) Instead of being ignored by our respective President/Prime Minister, we become a force to be reckoned with."

The goal of the Liberals is to take professional autonomy away from teachers. This autonomy is enshrined in our contract."
britishcolumbia,30fmaw,Elaine_dance,3,Fri Mar 27 03:19:20 2015 UTC,Agreed. But the government doesn't really let that stop them now do they? I can think of something else that was enshrined in a contract.

britishcolumbia,30fmaw,Elaine_dance,0,Fri Mar 27 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"I am making an assumption yes, a hunch based on the previous comments and known agenda of the Liberals regarding the teaching profession.    The reason why I'm concerned is that there are two avenues for a teacher to become more skilled and trained in the art of education. One is inservice, or required training. These would be things that are mandated for all teachers and as such, are paid for by the employer. So say the District says all teachers must use a certain type of software. Then fine, pay for my training.   The other avenue in which we enrich our teaching practice is Professional Development. Individual teachers have the autonomy to choose which methods are of interest and benefit to them. This not only helps you personally  engage in the art of teaching, it ensures that there is a wide variety of of methods being practiced. This is a good thing because you can't have a one size fits all format for education. So both the teachers and the students are more engaged.     Teachers pay for their own PD workshops. PD days were added to the regular school calendar in 1972 without an increase of salary for the additional days of work."

britishcolumbia,30fmaw,Elaine_dance,-3,Fri Mar 27 03:05:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they do.  Most professionals (non-unionized ones) don't automatically get paid to develop new career skills either.

britishcolumbia,30ak6w,huge_douche_nozzle,2,Wed Mar 25 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"Let's look at it this way, your F1 and F2 all paid 100 towards the total of 300. You have no clue where F1 or F2 got their money, could be jobs, could be pay day loans could be a rich Uncle.  Now a year later F1 leaves. At this point if F1 wanted his share back F1 should have asked for it and you and F2 should have split the cost, $50 each. Now you and F2 have a $150 split in the final amount.  Now if F1 didn't ask for his money back and left and has been gone for a bit and is clear that he doesn't want his money then the same still applies 50% of the deposit back for you and F2.  Unless of course you have any room mate agreements or other docs saying other wise.  As for F1 lending money to F2 that is between the two of them.   Personally I would say if F1 is not asking for money back just split evenly with F2 and there is less drama and you are walking out ahead.  Another way to look at it is if the place is trashed and the landlord comes after you and f2 for the damages, would you want F2 posting to Reddit saying how much of a something or other you are and is there any way that F2 could bail out of paying for the damages and leaving it all to you? :) Just another way of looking at it....  Now if F2 owes you money then when you get your deposit back, in front of other people, you make it loud and clear that ""hey remember that $$$ you owe me? Harder for them to duck out of it :)"

For example, one question asks km a detailed question about the future possibility of a line reversal. A line reversal is a massive undertaking and a detailed response would require a team of engineers, millions of dollars, and a whole new environmental assessment process where questions could be asked. Kms response was ""we have no plans to do a line reversal"". To someone anti pipeline this may seem like a poor response, but it's reasonable. The purpose of the environmental assessment is to look at the current project, not potential projects 50 years down the line that would require other environmental assessments.

britishcolumbia,2zqsyj,airchinapilot,6,Sat Mar 21 04:58:58 2015 UTC,"I wrote a similar reply to a thread about BC forestry few weeks ago, so here it is.  I'm a forestry student and work in the forest industry in the summer, so feel free to ask any other questions you may have. Basically, here is a sum of forestry in BC and who works in the forest:  Here in British Columbia the overwhelming majority of land is ""crown land"", land owned by the BC government. This map should give you a good idea. Forest tenures are the agreements that give private companies the rights to harvest timber on those lands, there are many different types depending on the stands. Companies need to apply for these and government can grant it out to them. It is a legal requirement here in BC to reforest after harvesting. The Forest and Range Practices Act outlines requirements of tenure holders, including the requirement to develop a Forest Stewardship Plan prior to any harvesting or road building is done in the area. This plan includes maps, intended strategies/results, and other requirements set by the government or that a specific to the area. There are 11 FRPA values that must addressed as part of the plan: soil, timber, wildlife, fish, water, biodiversity, cultural heritage resources, resource features, recreation resources, visual quality, forage and associated plant communities. Before harvesting is done, the FSP must be approved by the government, once that happens the government will issue road building and/or cutting permits.  The private land in BC is covered by the Private Managed Forest Land Act, it's a bit different than FRPA, ""highly flexible and more industry-friendly"". The large portion of private land on Vancouver Island, where I live near the bottom left corner of the map, were mostly a result of the E&N Railway Land Grant many years ago. Now there are a few companies who own and operate on that land. Private land is also subject to different export laws that crown land, and thus these companies have been shipping raw logs overseas in recent years... that's another story... a somewhat complicated one...  Who works in the forest?  There are many companies located all over the province that are involved in forestry, some that handle the harvesting, some that handle the planning, planting, etc. Larger companies sometimes give out contracts for another company to harvest the timber for them, some companies do the harvesting and everything themselves. There are also lots of consulting firms that do engineering and other planning work for the larger companies.  Most forestry jobs in our province require some form of post secondary education, from heavy equipment operators to head foresters. I'm currently finishing up my second year of schooling in Forest Resource Technology and will have a Diploma in it in a couple months. With a diploma you can register, after a few ""forester in training years"", with the Association of BC Forest Professionals (ABCFP) as a Registered Forest Technologist (RFT). Many jobs require this or a higher degree of education, though most companies also hire summer students who do not have these qualifications yet. After anywhere from 4-6 years, or longer depending on how you want to do it, of post secondary schooling in the appropriate program, you can receive a Bachelor of Science in Forestry (or other similar names, there are a few options for this). With the Bachelor Degree you are eligible to become an Registered Professional Forester (RPF). Most higher end employees in companies have this status, and almost all higher end forestry jobs require you to be an RPF."

To add to this, these companies pay a tiny amount of tax on land they acquired for a song, but can sell the land off for real estate development. TimberWest is essentially a development company holding property until the time is right to be able to cash in."
britishcolumbia,2zqsyj,AdiposeFin,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:04:37 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this reply. I will read through all the links you posted.   That map of crown and private lands is amazing. I had no idea there was so much crown land.   A couple of questions:   Does crown land ever/often become private land or vice versa? Do citizens have the right to access crown land if they so desire? What does a professional in the forestry sector do in the winter?
britishcolumbia,2zqsyj,8ecca8ee,1 point,Sat Mar 21 07:23:12 2015 UTC,"You are free to travel  in, camp in and hunt in crown land. The only thing you generally can't do is build permanent structures on Crown Land unless you have a lease that allows you to do so. Companies lease Crown Land in order to make use of the resources  or to maintain a right of way."

britishcolumbia,2zqsyj,mollycoddles,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:50:15 2015 UTC,"The other guy here already answered some of these, but I thought I would too.   Crown land is sometimes sold off and turned in to private land, usually for residential development.  Crown land can also be leased for residential purposes. Every BC resident has the right to access crown land and is allowed to camp/stay at a place for up to 14 days. Log harvesting and other forest activities still happen in the winter. Especially since there's no fire hazard at this time of year compared to the summer. Sometimes it's easier to harvest in the winter when the ground is frozen, there's less of an impact on the site. Here on the island where we get lots of rain the activities can be limited by the sheer amount of water that we get from weather systems. Most forest operations have shut down procedures and monitor rainfall to avoid doing certain higher risk activities when the environment is at risk due to high rainfall."

britishcolumbia,2zqsyj,threelinestory,3,Fri Mar 20 22:07:45 2015 UTC,I've always wished the loging company s would use artists and art grants to at least make them into funny shapes so they are somewhat pleasing to look at  Octopi and squid on a mountain side would never get old
britishcolumbia,2zqsyj,threelinestory,4,Fri Mar 20 22:58:07 2015 UTC,"Hey I walk through those and replant them in the summer.  Sometimes those areas are cut and burned to the ground to stave off the pine beetle infestation, but otherwise it's all devastating clear cut. Logging companies pay for the rights to log the area, and have 50 years to have it back to growing like it was, or else they pay stiff fines. It's pretty much like soft lumber crops, on a huge scale."

Both Tofino and the Juan de Fuca Trail areas are quite similar in that they are both on the west side of the island and have a rainforest feel, so I would suggest picking one (my suggestion is Tofino; however, it is very isolated and I would suggest staying at least two nights while going to one of the beaches i mentioned before would only be a half or full day trip from Victoria). If you plan on going to Tofino, I suggest stopping at MacMillan Park aka Cathedral Grove.

If you will be here on the summer, check out Tall Tree, Rock the Shores, Rock the Woods, Sunfest,  Skafest, Beerfest and Meatfest would all be with getting tickets for.

So things like if the car is stolen, if the RO has bail conditions, if the car is associated to a crime and if the RO has a criminal record.   2: The 10-28; which is the registered owner information.  This includes the address and name of the registered owner, the make model and VIN of the car, the Driver's license of the Primary operator, and if the plate has active insurance on it.  3: The 10-27; which is the registered owners driver's license.  So it has tombstone information like name, address, birthdate.  But also if the driver is prohibited, what class of DL they have, if they have restrictions (like needing glasses or air brake endorsements) and for the past five years if they have had an Immediate Roadside Prohibition.  There is also an option to get driving history, which is the driving offences the RO has been convicted of in the past 5 years.   Then finally is any history about the vehicle on PRIME, which is the police records.  So if the car has been in a collision, broken in to, stolen, or whatever there might be a police record about.    We already have a whole bunch of information about you before we have even talked to you.  So I'm not sure how ICBC giving us your phone number is some sort of privacy breach.  Obviously there is a need to talk to this person.  10-28's from Alberta have the telephone number on the record.  BC does not.  I'm not sure how easy it would be for ICBC to just put the RO's telephone number on the 10-28, but I doubt it wouldn't be more than a few lines of code to add it to the 10-28.    I can tell you this, in my experiences most people who are hard to get a hold of are usually shady.  Most people will either answer their phone, or call me back if I leave a message or a text.  Shady people with questionable practices avoid me, which is probably part of the reason why I'm trying to talk to them in the first place."

The Province, as your link shows, holds 8% cumulative preferred shares. This doesn't mean they only own 8% of the ferry corp, it means that when BC Ferries turns a profit they pay 8% of it to the government as a dividend on the stock (this is usually a quarterly payout, so 32% of the profit annually).   By structuring things this way the Liberals retain 100% control over the operation of the ferry service, milk cash out of it when it turns a profit, but if the ferries run into debt it doesn't get shown as a loss on the overall provincial budget like it did when BC Ferries was a standard Crown Corp. like Hydro is."

Now. if the BCFC had a goal to sustain a small profit (sufficient to cover contingencies) they would be operating at just a bit more than the marginal cost of production.

britishcolumbia,2zhyca,quaintbucket,13,Wed Mar 18 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I grew up there, and...well, I'm biased due to a crappy childhood, but PG is a tough place to grow up. It's been hit hard by poor lumber prices, the closing of a main sawmill/major employer, and there are a lot of issues with crime, poverty, drug use, etc. There is also a lot of gang activity there (Triads and Hells Angel) but that may have changed since the '90s/2000s. Parts of the infrastructure are crumbling, and the transit system there is awful. (Tough if you're a teen or don't have a car).  In terms of employment for your wife, it really depends on what field she's in. There's always demand for healthcare providers, and due to the poverty-related social and drug/alcohol issues I think there's a need for counsellors, social workers, etc. not sure about other sectors - there's some stiff completion for work and unemployment is high.  I said a lot of negative things, but again I found it a tough place to grow up. It's a rough northern town, and it's true that there's a lot to offer in terms of recreation, but there are far better places to live in BC if you have options."
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,FlightsFancy,4,Wed Mar 18 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"It's still not all roses, but UNBC has changed the town a lot since you left. There is now decent transit, culture and sports for a town its size.   The fact that it's the (unofficial) capital of northern BC brings both positives and negatives. It has a more diverse economy and culture than anywhere else in the north, but also the majority of social services so addicted and poor people congregate there.  I left while they were still cutting down pine beetle trees, so I'm not really sure how the economy is right now."

britishcolumbia,2zhyca,NorthernTrash,10,Wed Mar 18 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"It's a rough town. It's not particularly scenic, especially compared to the rest of BC.  I personally would call PG the least attractive place in all of BC to live in... maybe on par with FSJ, even though that place seems a little less messed up in terms of crime and drugs.  For your wife finding a job might be tough, as there are few to none corporate offices around there. Maybe the corporate offices of the lumber companies have some jobs. Government is probably her best shot.  Based on my experiences the only good thing to ever come out of PG is Cariboo (the beer). You do have some pretty awesome provincial parks and what not within a few hours drive, or closer. And you're only a few hours away from towns like Kamloops and Kelowna if you want to get away for the weekend.  Then again: every place is what you make of it, I live in a small and remote town as well, and there really is no such thing as boring towns, just boring people. There are probably tons of people there that are in the same boat as you: got a good job, but not quite sure about the town.  I hope your job and pay bump is worth it!"
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,airchinapilot,3,Wed Mar 18 19:55:17 2015 UTC,It's a more challenging job than what I have (which is what I want) with more opportunities and a pension plan with the city.

Cost of living is not expensive there but its the kind of city you see a lot of 'ghetto' stuff. The only thing I miss about PG is the winter. Lots of snow great for outside activities, its also the only time of year the city does not look dirty.

britishcolumbia,2zhyca,almostlucid,4,Thu Mar 19 03:11:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  I'm currently living in PG.  Haven't grown up or raised a family here, but in terms of my experiences, here's my opinion:  Pros:  Cost of living is pretty cheap.  Easy to find jobs that pay decently well.  Some really good, community involved restaurants (Copper Pig, Nancy-O's, and Chimos all come to mind).  Houses are cheap as hell.    Most of the people are pretty nice.  Cons:  Stinky and ugly.  Pulp mills will make the air smell like farts and hamster cages.  ENDLESS WINTER.  Unless you're into winter sports and outdoorsy stuff there can really be a lack of things to do.  Most of the people running things at the municipal level are fucking morons.  Speaking of that, the intellectual level of the city as a whole is honestly not that high.  Lots of racists, especially against the First Nations population, unfortunately. :(  May begin to corrode your soul if you don't have adequate emotional defences.   (edited for formatting).  PS: If you have any other specific questions, feel free to PM me :)."
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,SwimmingNaked,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! I don't mind endless winter to be honest (used to camp in the snow).  Used to racists but fortunately, don't deal with that often. Would this be an issue for my wife and I? We are an interracial (Caucasian and Filipino) couple with kids.  How are the FN with PG residents? Are they OK with some people interested in their culture and traditions or are they generally more reserved and prefer to be left alone?  what did you mean about the municipal government? Can you expand on that?  What did you also mean corroding my soul? Just curious :)  Thank you!"
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,gwg8420,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"In my experience, most of the racism is directed towards First Nations.  I know a Filipino here pretty well (she's a friend and fellow master's student) and she's never mentioned anything to me about racism, so I think you should be fine in that regard.  The First Nations people can vary in their interaction with residents.  Honestly, most of the interaction I've had with First Nations people has been through the educational system, so I might be seeing a pretty limited side.  I don't know if I'm the best person to answer that question for you.  The municipal government is just kind of disorganized and useless.  They're not excellent with their budget, snow removal is constantly an issue, and it takes forever for any decision to be made.    About corroding the soul...erm...it's hard to describe. There are just places where if you stay in them long enough you feel like you'll become stagnant and depressed.  Prince George feels like one of those places to me.  I went here to go to school and didn't play on staying here a very long time.  It's been good for school and getting a head start with work experience and things like that, but I don't know if I'd want to live here longer than a decade.  Too cold for me, too ugly, too stinky...I'm from the Kootenays originally, so I guess I'm used to prettier places.  Also, I don't have a huge amount of friends here, so that's probably influencing my impression too.  Hope that helps. :)"

They've had crime and drug issues. There's a way to go there yet but it is better than it used to be.  There's a lot of industry and your wife can likely find a position somewhere.  There are a lot of services for a family. There's a burgeoning farmer's market. Many festivals/concerts.

Look around beaverly)   I don't know what field your wife is in or her qualifications for employment so it'd be tough to guess.

britishcolumbia,2zhyca,atrojovsky,4,Thu Mar 19 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"Current resident, I work in the media, and moved up from Burnaby in 2013 after finishing school at BCIT. PG is a great, relatively modern small city with most of the amenities a person could hope for. There is access to nature and a variety of outdoor activities, there are two local Jr. hockey teams which have strong fanbases, there are a handful of golf course within a few minutes drive of each other, and there's all the stores and shops a person might need. There's a fantastic sense of community, and many people are very welcoming and open to new residents.  UNBC seems to be a very nice institution, despite being currently mired in a labour battle with its Faculty Association. There's lots of interesting research going on, and the student body seems active and aware within the community at large. The local restaurant scene is better than Kamloops - there's a very good selection of small, niche eateries offering a wide variety of styles. From BBQ, to Indian food, Thai, Sushi, so-called Pub food, and good, locally sourced meat and produce, there's something for (almost) everyone. The Arts scene is alive in the city, although they could use a bigger space to house everyone under one roof (that's an issue which won't be solved anytime soon). There are two different theater ""companies"" in town,who regularly put on productions throughout the year. One of my biggest complaints is the local movie theatre - the selection isn't as broad as I grew accustomed to living in the Lower Mainland. But with the internet, Netflix, and TV on Demand, it's a sacrifice I can live with. As for the labels of ""rough"" town, due to crime, and gang activity, I've seen little enough of that as a private resident. Crime has been reduced (one of the reasons it was high in the first place was because of a different way of reporting crimes by the RCMP here). There are certainly an element who choose to live outside the law, but if you don't go out of your way to become involved in their ""business"" you shouldn't be in any kind of danger. Cost of living is significantly lower than living in the GVRD - a starter home in PG tends to run in the $200-300K range, which is crazy cheap, (comparatively).  Here's some pro-PG literature from Initiatives Prince George, an economic development corporation in the city.  If you have any questions about more specifics, feel free to ask! Good luck with the decision."

britishcolumbia,2zhyca,BikesBeersCoffee,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"I used to go there on occasion when I lived in Northern B.C.  I know about PG's problems with crime and gang activity by reputation only, since I never encountered any of it firsthand.  One thing that isn't really mentioned in this thread is that PG is not the place to be if you or your family have any respiratory problems.  PG has pulp mill or two nearby so the air is often filthy, sometimes to the point where the city has a distinctive, sour smell.  I am sure people who live there get used to the smell, but you should at least ask the question as to whether you really want that in your lungs."
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,EntsInTheNorth,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:59:12 2015 UTC,"Air Quality has improved significantly over the past few years, as a direct result of the issues that existed in the past. Both pulp mills have decreased the particulate output of their operations, both in the amount sent into the air, and the size of the particulate. There's certainly a... distinct... odor in the air some days, but I'd say the air quality is less of an issue than it was in the past."

britishcolumbia,2zhyca,KirbyGiver,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:37:11 2015 UTC,Everyone focuses on the mills but it's the Husky that is the real culprit.  I work with many people from both outfits and it seems to be the general consensus.  We still seem to have constant air advisory warnings.
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,KirbyGiver,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Good point on respiratory illness. As far as I know, nobody have any respiratory issues so we should be ok on that front.  What caused the sour smell? Is it a chemical from the mills off gassing?"
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,KirbyGiver,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"I could not tell you to be honest.  I would assume that it has something to do with the chemicals they use, I understand that producing wood pulp is a pretty intensive chemical process.  But PG's air quality issues (which may actually be better now according to /u/BigMan_on_Camera) definitely have a lot to do with the mills.  I also know that it depends on where you are in the city too.  I have friends that go to UNBC and apparently the air quality is much better up on campus than down by the river."
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,KirbyGiver,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:34:46 2015 UTC,"The odour is a result of a type of sulphur used in the process of breaking down the wood fibre. I've driven by the mill on my way out to Shelley, and the smell at the site could choke a donkey."
britishcolumbia,2zhyca,alphawolf29,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:23:45 2015 UTC,"I grew up in PG until I was 13 when I moved. I didn't think the town was all that bad until I grew up and began to understand some of the things I saw and experienced growing up. I spent time living closer to the downtown core as well as out in more suburban areas; from my experience, suburbia is where you'd want to be living. The city is riddled with crime and poverty and now that I'm older I can appreciate why my parents where so weary with me going out downtown or to hangout with my friends. PG to me is a big bad zit on the face of BC and does fit in the definition of ""Beautiful British Colombia"". There never was a whole lot to do around town, most of the excitement was to be had hunting or fishing or more outdoorsy activities just outside town. Cheap housing was Prince George's silverlining, especially if you could get a nice place away from ""the bowl"", that way you rarely have to see or deal with any of the ilk that spawns in the center of town. The winters are harsh and not for the faint of heart and the air quality triggered my allergies pretty bad some days. It sounds like a lot of negatives and might seem pretty overly exaggerated, but I am yet to meet someone else who has lived there and had a good story about that city. I wouldn't say don't go live there, especially if there is money to be made, because if you can tune out most of the nastiness it's really not all that bad. I went to elementary school there for 8 years and it felt like a pretty good, standard experience, nothing bad to say about the school I went to but I've heard horror stories from some of the other schools. I can't give you a firsthand source on the High-school system but from what I know, PGSS being the main school in town, is heavily over populated but with that being the only real issue I'm aware of. UNBC is a very good school and I wish I has the opportunity to go there. I feel my opinion might be biased but when I was young I felt relatively safe and comfortable there, it wasn't until I had left did I understand how different I felt about what I experienced there."

It would be really confusing if an established telco started offering plans in mB/s, as it would appear to be 8 times slower for the same price.  Canadian telcos are generally shifty, but I think this is the least confusing way to advertise the service level."

For example where i live shaw said the fastest that they can sell me is 25M download, well techsavvy over those same lines promised more then twice that, and delivered.   The large companies in BC ( and all of canada ) are creating artificial bottlenecks. The infrastructure is not overloaded in any way. It all depends what your provisioning information is.   I had the exact same issues with shaw as you until I switched. Give Techsavvy a call about it, they can explain better then I. There is a setup fee and you SHOULD buy your own modem from them. its worth it in the long run."
britishcolumbia,2z0x0x,fmkaiba,2,Sun Mar 15 08:36:15 2015 UTC,Yes. But maybe they have a higher speed plan for not a lot more money?  Also TekSavvy isn't usually the only option.

Any time of the day you like he gets between 1 and 5.  They're just overloaded. They oversold their service and didn't bother to upgrade to meet the demand they were selling. I'll probably have the same issue sooner or later but for now my speeds are pretty solid.

We also just got 3G coverage all the way to FSJ this month with a new tower they finally activated in between HH and FSJ.  PRIS has started to develop its own fibre optic grid in town with maybe two dozen customers so far, but they don't have their own backbone going out of town at the moment and telus wont let them get on their line, so its all going out on a big wireless link to FSJ which IIRC is on the roof of the Quality Inn."

On a good day I'll hit 10 Mbps with my Shaw ""Broadband 50"" package.  I've tested it at 20-ish Mbps a couple of times and nearly 50 Mbps ONCE in the 4 years and 2 locations I've had the service. Currently I'm struggling along at 4 Mbps because it's dinnertime..  I don't think these bands are broad enough to be called broadband.

britishcolumbia,2yxtk4,Mustard-Tiger,3,Fri Mar 13 19:02:11 2015 UTC,"I am a millwright by trade. I've worked at projects at various types of power plants across BC and Alberta and happen to live in the Peace region as well (Hudson's Hope). The next job I'm going to later this month will be a shutdown at a power plant in Alberta. I have friends that work for BC Hydro so I've spent a lot of time learning from them about operations.  Anyways what it really comes down to is economics. We've spent over 100 years making our provincial electrical utilities in BC into a highly dispatchable system which is why we not only have some of the cheapest power bills in Canada but also one of the most profitable utility companies. Simply, our base load is pretty much all hydro electric which gives greater control over the electricity markets than gas or steam turbines. We can turn them on or off in seconds, you cannot do that with gas or steam, they require long cool down and warm up cylces thus they tend to be kept running 24/7. Which is why the price of power fluctuates so wildly in provinces like Alberta. They always have excess as most of their generation comes from coal fired steam plants or gas turbines. In BC we can sell lots of power during the day when prices are high, ramp down production in the evening and get nearly free power from Alberta overnight because they pretty much have to give it away for peanuts overnight to their neighbors.   I have nothing against IPPs developing their own projects, they're great supplemental sources of power. In fact we have a number of wind turbine projects in the Peace region running and under construction as well as gas generators, turbines, and cogeneration from the forestry and oil and gas facilities in the area. I just don't think BC Hydro themselves would ever build any mega projects other than hydroelectric."

If you really want beach you can't go wrong with Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park but it is a couple hour drive from anything you could consider a city.

britishcolumbia,2yxy5f,Limesareoranges,2,Fri Mar 13 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"A bit late but lemme give you some directions and suggestions.   The two big cities, Victoria and Vancouver are full of small activities in town. You can rent a scooter and take in downtown, you can kayak in the inner harbour of Victoria or English bay in Vancouver, there's tons of various sized parks in both cities and many more.   One thing those two cities have going for them is the huge ""imagination economy"" which is the amount of creativity and art you will find in the streets. Buskers are in plenty, you will find many roasts selling their crafts or paintings and there are even live plays for free at the right spots in town.   Outside of the cities you have the reason we are called beautiful British Columbia. The mountains are gorgeous, the forests lush and the views spectacular. In Vancouver and don't want to go far? Stanley park, mt seymour, grouse grind, Lynn Valley. Want to go a bit further? Whistler blackcomb, sunshine coast, and many more.   If you are in Victoria you have the gowland todd, Mount Finlayson, eat Sooke Park, goldstream, Sooke potholes, Mount work and many many more super close. A bit further up and you have miracle beach, China beach, long Beach, tofino, Parksville, combs, cowichan bay etc.   If you swing by the centre of the province you will find yourself in the Okanogan Valley. There you will find lakes and wineries by the plenty. Go for a wine tour, meet some people and go camping, go skydiving or paragliding.   And a bit further East you have the rocky Mountains. You have some down in the states but you only get half! Go see Lake Louise and stay in the lodge and hike to the summit. Emerald Lake, emerald triangle, golden, Rainbow Lake, jasper, banff and so many more.   My tip to you: Google each big location and see what interests you. Anything is possible. Take your time and enjoy the scenery while you are here and if you drink we have some world renown micro breweries and if you smoke the green be careful of the potency of BC bud.   Most important tip: have fun and meet people, interact! You will get some of the relax West coast of Canada vibes. Cheers eh!"
britishcolumbia,2yvm03,themoist,15,Fri Mar 13 04:21:59 2015 UTC,2 things: they've done studies to say that raising the minimum wage does not kill jobs.  And that I'd prefer a basic income rather than arguing every few years for a measly increase that doesn't reflect the actual cost of living.
britishcolumbia,2yvm03,Sardonicwords,6,Fri Mar 13 12:30:29 2015 UTC,"Anytime someone argues against raising the minimum wage, it reminds of a good summary of Reaganomics:  ""The problem with the economy is that poor people have too much money"".   Or as George Carlin put it:  “Conservatives say if you don't give the rich more money, they will lose their incentive to invest. As for the poor, they tell us they've lost all incentive because we've given them too much money.”"
britishcolumbia,2yvm03,snickerson11,15,Fri Mar 13 15:59:43 2015 UTC,That's a sad increase. It should be 15.

Many countries likes Australia were able to weather economic issues because of their higher minimum wage. And we need to start balancing out the fact that all the wealth gains are going to a very small population of those who already have more than enough assets."

Higher prices negate the effect of a minimum wage increase, because the poor stay poor.  Now the mom and pop shops lose more business from their bottom tier, which is growing rapidly.  Next year voters will scream for another increase. Prices go up again.  Don't you all realize that this system is built to fail? You are all just prolonging the inevitable.

This is a chicken before the egg debate, unfortunately it all comes down to money supply and financial systems. When you create more money out of nothing, the value of your existing money deflates, causing inflation. As inflation increases, people are left with less money to survive.

Exploring areas up around Gun Lake, between Harrison and Lillooete Lake, and along with some areas out in the Shulaps as well, the drive from Pemberton to Lillooete is just as magnificent, if not more so in its own way.

britishcolumbia,2yhtvn,gilbertsmith,7,Mon Mar 9 22:52:16 2015 UTC,"IANAL.  But, based from my experience, my biggest piece of advice to you would be start documenting everything ASAP. Do not wait until later, details will be forgotten (I assure you).  Document every interaction you have with management (time, date, place etc.), save every written notice you are given. For now, you are up shits creek unfortunately.  Every cost you incur as a result of this, get receipts, and hold on to them. You are in the right, but the RTA of BC leaves you with little power under these circumstances.  Once you are back in your unit, you may politely ask management for compensation for the expenses you incurred as a result of this. Once they say no, you may file a claim with the RTB.  Do not withhold rent, do not lose your cool, do not forget to document anything."

britishcolumbia,2yhtvn,KPexEA,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"Well I think 24 hours is not enough. Though perhaps if the bed bug thing was found and the pest control agency has told your landlord ""This is really bad you have to deal with it immediately"".  That may be far fetch but.... You can always talk to the landlord tenancy branch if you like.  The flip side of this is that I know someone in an apartment that moved in and in less than a month started getting bedbug bites. They had a year long contract and the landlord did not do anything. They left it up to the individual units to deal with. The problem there is that if they did it and one other unit didn't do it, the bugs would come back.  The cost of the washer and dryer, and bags is trivial compared to what the landlord is going to pay to have the units done. But imagine what would happen if these steps were not taken?  Personally I would question only the time frame nothing else."
britishcolumbia,2yhtvn,Doobage,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"When you're paying 15k a year for an apartment, I feel fully justified in expecting some kind of compensation for this. Whether it's being put up in a hotel room for a couple nights, being given access to a vacant unit (which they did do.. though it wasn't cleaned and now we have fucking fleas on our stuff and our pets), or a break in the rent.  I pay my rent on time, I don't trash my apartment, there's never been complaints about us that I'm aware of, but when shit like this happens they treat us like crap. That's not cool. If I had brought bedbugs in maybe, but I didn't. I shouldn't have to pay a cent for this.  I'm really not impressed with them lately. It might be the lack of sleep talking because I've had a combined 6 hours in the last 3 fucking days. From 6PM to 2AM on Monday my wife and I tore apart everything we owned, moved it into the middle of the room, and put everything else in garbage bags. We slept about 3 hours, with the cats deciding the bags were the coolest things ever and fucking around with them. 7AM we give up, get up, and continue packing shit. 10AM we go to do a ""move in"" on this vacant unit. 10:30ish we start moving some stuff we need down there. 6PM we finally have everything we own packed up and we're moved into a temporary unit. We try to sleep on an air matress. We discovered we were really itchy and found out this apartment had fucking fleas in it. Plus it's a corner unit, and the dog is flipping out every time someone comes down the stairwell or slams the door. Which is every 20 minutes, all night. We didn't sleep much that night. I didn't want to try and go sleep in the truck and track them out there. I go to work with no sleep.. we get home last night at 6PM, and get told we have to get out of the unit because they want to paint it. So we have to move all our shit back upstairs. Move shit around to try and get the bed back on the floor, try to figure out which of the 9000 bags we put the sheets in. Can't sleep because of the cats again.  Finally this morning I'm trying to get ready for work, I can't find any fucking clothes. I haven't shaved in 3 days, I'm wearing the same clothes for the last 3 days. We ran out of laundry soap and we can't afford to buy more until Monday because we've spent everything on fucking garbage bags and fast food because we have no pots, no pans, no dishes. We had no bath mat so my socks got soaked last night, then I spilled some kitty litter when the bag ripped. I ended up finding a pair of dirty socks in the suitcase that I put in there in September of 2013. Good enough, I'm wearing them now.  Oh, and I didn't have time to walk the dog this morning because I spent it looking for clothes and other shit. I put a puppy pad down but if he knocks the puppy gate down he'll probably pee in the kitchen and soak a bunch of boxes or something. So that'll be awesome.  This is like the shittiest camping trip ever. Fuck renting."

A billion litres of water is the annual rainfall of an area of less than 1 square kilometre in that area of BC. It's also 4.5 minutes worth of fresh water discharge from the Fraser River.

britishcolumbia,2yewp6,PotentialApathy,0,Mon Mar 9 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which would be a really good point if we were talking about river discharge or rainfall, which we're not. Do your research on the story. The new policy is for groundwater. All that rainfall would be SUPER USEFUL if someone would just create a 1km square basin to catch it all in but of course that's not how industry works. What area of BC are you talking about? Groundwater is easier to use for most industrial purposes because it's not running anywhere. Hey, I think we should be using rainwater instead of groundwater if we can, but that's never going to happen when it's this absurdly cheap.   I'm not saying we don't have enough water. I'm saying we're charging too little."
britishcolumbia,2yewp6,Dennis-Moore,3,Mon Mar 9 23:21:41 2015 UTC,"Are saying rain water doesn't recharge groundwater? Your original comment was very emphatic about the fact the water is ""fucking gone"", so I guess so? Maybe you should do some research, because there certainly is flux there."

britishcolumbia,2yewp6,Dennis-Moore,4,Tue Mar 10 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"so saying that rainwater replenishes groundwater in this context is a bit like saying that plankton replenish oil reserves. Its technically true but its too slow to matter.   Good god, man, where do you want me to start? First, you're wrong, and worse yet you're arguing about fluid flow rates through unconsolidated sediments with a geologist. Second, rainwater replenishes the Fraser Lowland basin annually and only in the driest years is the recharge not full (source). That source is a bit old, but even at that point there were over 30 monitoring stations in the Fraser Valley. To say there's no plan in place for water table management is patently false. Thousands of people rely on wells in that basin and they monitor it closely.  You don't like Nestle. Fine. You don't want them bottling BC water. Fine. If that's what you want stick to facts with your arguments."
britishcolumbia,2yewp6,PotentialApathy,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:47:43 2015 UTC,"Huh. Well colour me surprised. I had no idea groundwater replenished that quickly. Talking out of my ass again.  Would you happen to know if those figures are typical for the rest of the province though? Clearly large scale extraction of groundwater is environmentally feasible in the lower fraser basin, as I should have known considering most of its usage is probably irrigation anyway. Clearly a billion litres is peanuts for the lower fraser but it still seems like it could fuck up Cache Creek. Anyway thanks for the information."
britishcolumbia,2yewp6,Dennis-Moore,3,Tue Mar 10 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for being honest about being wrong, you're a rare breed on the internet.  I would imagine things would be much slower in Cache Creek than Hope, but there is some irrigated farming around there that must  draw from a water table serviced by both Cache creek and the Thompson. I'm guessing, but I'd imagine flat ground in the valley bottom is the constraint on farming there, not the recharge rate of groundwater. I don't know that for sure, though. It wouldn't be a good place for a water bottling plant because it's too far from market.  With the Nestle situation I can appreciate people being prickly about such a massive company sucking away at groundwater and paying nothing for it, but water is the most abundant and renewable resource we have in BC. We need to monitor it carefully, but we also need to consider that it's a key component or the entirety of our best hopes for indefinitely sustainable industry in the province. Maybe Nestle doesn't pay much for that water, and maybe we need to monitor their usage carefully, but in the mean time they are providing jobs (which leads to income tax revenue) and paying corporate tax, too. We're definitely not getting nothing out of the deal as a province.  Now, the merits and faults of bottled water is a discussion for another day and definitely one worth considering."
britishcolumbia,2yewp6,PotentialApathy,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"Lol np. Next time it might be my specialty.   Yeah, I guess it makes sense that nestle would be bottling in the most water-abundant areas of the province.   But there is a price at which nestle will move its operations to Ontario or Alaska or Idaho or who knows where. I can't believe that were anywhere near that price. And I think the reason for that is ideological and not budgetary. Maybe they're thinking if they charge a real moolah instead of some nominal fee it'll set some kind of threatening precedent for the Columbia shared watershed or something, they're always bickering over that. Anyway thx"
britishcolumbia,2yewp6,Dennis-Moore,6,Tue Mar 10 08:22:49 2015 UTC,You do understand that a single 640ac section of irrigated land can easily use a billion litres of water in a single season?  It honestly is a literal drop in the bucket of BC's hydrological resources.

britishcolumbia,2yewp6,Dennis-Moore,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"On the face of it, it seems crazy, but there is almost certainly more to it.

Although it might be sustainable at the moment, what about when BC has a relative drought, or California's drought worsens?

britishcolumbia,2y81dq,exoriare,5,Sun Mar 8 01:36:41 2015 UTC,"There are two, diametrically opposed views on this.   The traditional perspective holds that access to clean water is a social good. Water is essential to human life. Impure water is a powerful vector for communicable disease (cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, etc). As a basic social health measure, the government therefore has a strong and overwhelming interest in preserving access to clean water supplies for everyone - rich or poor.   Nestle's argument runs a bit shallower. They've observed that  access to clean water is so valuable that people will pay more to access it. The CEO of Nestle has stated that clean water is so valuable, it should be privatized - from their perspective, water is not a social good, but it most certainly is a marketable one. They believe that people should pay for access to clean water, and that the cost of water should be determined by the market. Consequent to this argument is that those who cannot or will not pay should not have access to clean water.    Clean drinkable water is facing a number of threats in North America. Fracking has contaminated a lot of water tables in the US, and this will soon be coming to BC in a big way. Over the next decade, the provincial government will deal with huge pressures to debase water tables in exchange for resource royalties. More and more people will be convinced to drink bottled water because they don't trust the stuff that comes through their pipes. This has already happened in a big way in the US, which is a leading consumer of bottled water.    There are a couple of companies positioned to take advantage of any debasement of public water supplies: Nestle, and Pepsi (Dasanji). For these companies, any disaster in the public water supply is good news. Every 'boil water advisory' is a win, and a dose of dysentary would be like winning the jackpot.   Bottled water is an anti-social product that should be recognized as such. It should have the same markup as tobacco. If people paid $8 for the 'convenience', let at least $6 go to the most amazing convenience in human history: free access to clean water."
britishcolumbia,2y81dq,ManOfTheInBetween,-3,Sun Mar 8 08:38:18 2015 UTC,"They believe that people should pay for access to clean water   We do. Our tap water isn't ""free"".    Consequent to this argument is that those who cannot or will not pay should not have access to clean water.   They're not stating or advocating anything like that. If one is unwilling to pay taxes, drill a well on their land, or pay a corporation for water, Nestle still won't object to you collecting rain water, spring water, or clean water from any other public place.    Clean drinkable water is facing a number of threats in North America. Fracking has contaminated a lot of water tables in the US, and this will soon be coming to BC in a big way.    Didn't know you had a crystal ball that can see into the future. Do you have any idea how much clean water we have in BC? There's more than enough and plus it's a renewable resource.    Bottled water is an anti-social product that should be recognized as such.  It should have the same markup as tobacco. If people paid $8 for the 'convenience'...   Oh nonsense. The vast majority of plastic bottles are now recycled.  Do you have any idea how much coffee grounds end up in our landfills?  How would you like it if your Tim Horton's coffee was $20 tomorrow morning for the ""convenience""?

britishcolumbia,2y7zon,Mustard-Tiger,3,Sat Mar 7 17:03:54 2015 UTC,"You wanna see a black bear?  Just drive up to Pemberton and then drive around the valley.  Take some good binos or a spotting scope.  As you drive, if you see this big black blob out in a pasture it's a bear.  Some of the bears in Pemby are freaking HUGE.    In the spring, when the bears emerge from their dens, they go on a diet of grass and new growth.  They're very easy to spot out in the middle of the pastures in the Pemberton Valley.   They're not aggressive and are pretty docile.  Once they know you're there, they'll just mosey off in to the brush.  Just watch for cubs with Mamma.  If you see Cubs, Momma is not far away, so don't get between Momma and her cubs.   There is also a very remote chance of seeing a Grizzly bear.  Now.  A lot of people hunt for bears in the spring.  A lot of people go to Pemberton to do so.  Do not be surprized if you see hunters.  Do not interfere with them hunting."

britishcolumbia,2y7zon,AdiposeFin,2,Sun Mar 8 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm sure the tour company knows where bears are feeding and active.  So they will probably put you right on them.  But May is well in to spring and they should be out grazing on grass, so it wouldn't be hard to spot a few in those pastures.  Or just drive up the logging roads, look for giant piles of scat and you'll know they're near by."

Climate of article  Kamloops:       The climate of Kamloops is semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSk) due to its rain shadow location. Because of milder winters and aridity, the area west of Kamloops in the lower Thompson River valley falls within Köppen climate classification BWk climate. Kamloops gets short cold snaps where temperatures can drop to around −20 °C (−4 °F) when Arctic air manages to cross the Rockies and Columbia Mountains into the Interior.  The January mean temperature is −2.8 °C (27 °F).  That average sharply increases with an average maximum temperature of 4.3 °C (40 °F) in February. The average number of cold days below −10 °C (14 °F) per year is 19.9 as recorded by Environment Canada.   Although Kamloops is located above 50° north latitude, summers are warm to hot with prevailing dry, and sunny weather. Daytime humidity is generally low (sometimes less than 20% after a dry spell) which allows for substantial nighttime cooling. Occasional summer thunderstorms can create dry-lightning conditions, sometimes igniting forest fires which the area is prone to.

I've been a part-time paramedic for over five years waiting for a full-time spot (yes it takes that long). Part time paramedics make up over 70% of paramedics in BC and are paid based on an antiquated callout system where, if we don't get called, we only receive a $2/hr stipend. We don't receive benefits, sick days, or regularly scheduled shifts. It's extremely difficult to make a living with this career in BC which is why the service is struggling to recruit new people and constantly losing good paramedics to other provinces where they can earn a full-time wage. I'm glad the union is finally doing something positive."

People default for three reasons:   They are challenged at navigating bureaucracy They are not aware of the possibility of negotiating their loans or they believe that even a negotiated repayment will be too onerous They have the financial means to repay but would rather not   The purpose of this policy is to punish #3 and get #2 to the negotiating table. #1 will get hurt as collateral damage.  It would be nice if we had some statistics about the relative sizes of #1 and #3. It's a shame that government didn't release some to back up this policy."
britishcolumbia,2xndxc,HotterRod,2,Mon Mar 2 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"As someone who had his BC loan default on him (it went to collections before they amalgamated the BC/Canada loans) and had his paycheque deducted as a result, I can say that they provide more than enough means to get help.  If you are behind, and they call you up, and you say you have no money and don't see any coming in, they offer to send you forms to fill out to have your payments either reduced or fully postponed (including interest). If you accept they immediately put your payments on a three month hold (including interest) so you have time to receive, review, get help with, fill out, etc. the forms.  It was 100% my fault. I can joke with my coworkers that the collection agency wasn't very good at representing itself as a legitimate company, or that due to me moving they had issue keeping up with my address despite my constantly updating it with them and only changing phone numbers when I was at an address for 3 months already, or myriad other things that are all true...but when it really comes down to it, they are very helpful and other than issues with updating my address they always provided more than enough help navigating what options I had to myself. I simply ignored it.  I'm ""with"" people here that say that loans CAN and SHOULD be paid back. I'm all for a system that provides free education, but we don't have that system, and no one ever told us the money was free. Hell I had over $3000 of my Canada/BC loans ""forgiven"" just for graduating, and that wasn't advertised.  I won't even get into how I feel like I pissed the loan money away on bars restaurants when I had any extra leftover after school/books/rent was taken out (I worked while on school so ""rent"" was a floating budget that seemed to disappear around the time I secured my first summer job paycheque).  edit I should also note that when they contacted my employer about the payroll deduction, they asked my employer to provide me with a form that explained what was up and who to call if I wanted to stop it from happening. I decided if ignorance got me into it, it was time for ""ignorance"" to get me out and I just let it be. My employer even messed up and missed one deduction (to my happy surprise) and there was no hassle, just an email back and forth with the case manager and my manager."

britishcolumbia,2xj6fe,RumpleCragstan,3,Sun Mar 1 06:27:07 2015 UTC,"Enjoyable, but bland.   It's because we eat them when they're not ripe.  A ripe dragon fruit is very sweet and tastes like sprite.  Leave them out on the counter a little bit longer, and you'll see."

britishcolumbia,2xj6fe,ripe_program,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:31:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry bud. I've been running produce departments for years, you can get them most of the year. The problem is that they're not that popular and aren't carried by most stores regularly for this reason. I just threw out 20 lbs of the stuff because no one bought them.   IMO, if you want to get some call your local grocer, ask them to bring it in. Most can have it within two days and if you are willing to buy a couple there will be little problem getting."
