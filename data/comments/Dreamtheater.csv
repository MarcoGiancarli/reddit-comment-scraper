Dreamtheater,3dlnld,Hamlet7768,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:18 2015 UTC,Why is he being such a dick? Even when he was in the band he was a dick. I remember a chapter in the Lifting Shadows book where he played the wrong chords during album recording just to mess with the producer.
Dreamtheater,3dlnld,Florinator,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. Never knew about the wrong chord bit; I did know he was feeling isolated at the time, which contributed to his departure from the band."
Dreamtheater,3dlnld,Hamlet7768,2,Fri Jul 17 17:05:58 2015 UTC,There are old VHS recordings of them from the very early days and whenever he talks I can't shake that feeling that he's a douche :-)
Dreamtheater,3dlnld,Florinator,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"It wasn't actually completely wrong chords, he just played all the chords in the wrong inversion.

Dreamtheater,3dlnld,Zathu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:48 2015 UTC,Such shame. I think that it is one of their best songs. It is such a great combination of all other songs from the suite but still has its own character.

Dreamtheater,3dlnld,Tegamal,6,Fri Jul 17 23:16:39 2015 UTC,"Edit up top: Maybe it would be cooler if they made it a 2-3 night thing. Have a full night with Portnoy, honoring what he's done. Have an orchestra, special guests, full albums. They could make a festival out of it, really.   I wouldn't be surprised if they made it a 4-5 hour long thing. Wasn't Scenes From New York over 3 hours long? On top of Metropolis Pt 2 they played Learning to Live which very well could have been a closing epic. But instead they broke out A Change of Seasons! I remember James saying ""sorry about the short set"".   I thought Breaking the Fourth Wall was very long as well. They played very long epics, honored Awake & Metropolis Pt 2, & had an orchestra.   I imagine something similar for a last show. A looong concert with epic moments, guests, & sets."
Dreamtheater,3dlnld,SiriusC,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"They were also ten years younger for Scenes from New York, and that show completely exhausted all of them. If they did a 4-5 hour show it would have to have a huge break in the middle, or multiple large breaks."

I have a few questions, but I don't want you to feel as though you're surrounded by a glass prison, so I don't want you to feel obligated to answer them - remember, it's all about you, not me.   Do you feel as though this fatal tragedy will be talked about for years? A friend of mine who was forsaken in a similar way went through many hollow years where he'd wait for sleep until 6:00 every day. Do you think learning to live with with this will leave your sleep disturbed as you lie awake, hoping to just disappear? Don't be afraid, you're not the only one this has happened to. Have you tried staging an outcry? Unless I've misunderstood, I believe the band will often respond to the calls of admirers who show their blind faith. Do you think this will leave you to wither away, or are you confident that the best of times will come another day? What can we do to take away your pain while this is burning your soul?   Again, thanks for bringing us along for the ride as you pry a little beneath the surface to hear our voices and give us a glimpse of the bigger picture that is this nightmare to remember.

Dreamtheater,3dc9m7,Clydethefrawg,3,Wed Jul 15 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"The glass prison is probably the most brutal and relentless song, but some of the other heavies are of course Honor Thy Father, As I Am, A Nightmare to Remember, The Test That Stumped Them All, Constant Motion, The Shattered Fortress, This Dying Soul, and The Mirror."
Dreamtheater,3dc9m7,turdburgers,3,Wed Jul 15 06:35:47 2015 UTC,How come no one mentioned The Mirror/Lie?
Dreamtheater,3dc9m7,pm_me_your_foxgirl,2,Wed Jul 15 11:59:41 2015 UTC,The Mirror is heavy but some parts make it more progressive as a whole.
Dreamtheater,3dc9m7,toomuchf1re,3,Wed Jul 15 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"Puppies on Acid, a short live version of the mirror has the bass in overdrive.. Real heavy"

However Honour Thy Father, This Dying Soul, The Glass Prison, The Mirror, Peruvian Skies (the latter half), Panic Attack, Constant Motion and The Dark Eternal Night are also pretty heavy."
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,rcrell,18,Mon Jul 13 14:47:31 2015 UTC,man doing the vocals for this are going to be a frickin' challenge.

Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,turdburgers,3,Mon Jul 13 21:23:13 2015 UTC,I'm excited for the drums. I love Rock Band drums even though they aren't very realistic.
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,jacktheBOSS,2,Mon Jul 13 23:03:44 2015 UTC,There aren't keys in Rock Band 4 though.
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,turdburgers,2,Mon Jul 13 23:57:02 2015 UTC,Really? Why did they decide to take them out?
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,jacktheBOSS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:19:49 2015 UTC,"Low sales probably. More work than they're worth (in their eyes) maybe. I have the keyboard, so I'm a little bummed, but I never really played them anyway. All instruments mode was required to use it really which messed up the harmonies (everyone in my group's favorite part). We play big set lists too, so it was always lame to have to pick 12 songs with keys in a row. Only like 1/10 of my songs have them."
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,SC2Humidity,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:58 2015 UTC,"There's a custom version by Custom Creators' Collective out, and I've played everything except vox for it.  The hardest part is the fast guitar/key solo at the first part of the instrumental section (more or less because I can't go up on the guitar buttons, but I can scale down very fast).  The next hardest part would probably be doing the drums for ""I was told there's a miracle..."" on real drums cuz fuck that part the bass solo.  All around, I do have to try when I play it, but it's not an uphill battle.  It's a lot of fun."
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,vaultingbassist,9,Wed Jul 15 14:06:26 2015 UTC,Dat tapping bass solo.  Beyond pumped for this song.
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,regmaster,3,Mon Jul 13 15:13:02 2015 UTC,Will Rock Band 4 come with a double bass pedal?
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,jacktheBOSS,3,Mon Jul 13 16:34:02 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen in the packaging and promo images for the full bundle, I don't think so. I have a feeling they dumbed down the chart so that it's not necessary to have a second pedal."
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,losthiker68,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:38:12 2015 UTC,It will be double pedal compatible from the start probably with a menu selector just like the RB3 cymbals to tell the game you have it so it can change the chart.
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,daigoba66,2,Mon Jul 13 23:59:04 2015 UTC,It'd be nice if they'd do some Rocksmith releases.

Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,w1ldm4n,6,Mon Jul 13 15:21:25 2015 UTC,They are making a new game for the new consoles. How this sells will most likely determine if they continue making them.  I'm guessing it will sell on the nostalgia factor but won't do incredibly well.
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,jacktheBOSS,4,Mon Jul 13 16:07:19 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard it'll probably also include the ability to import/DLC the tracks from old games, so it's mostly just a ""hey guess what you can play Rock Band and all your favorite songs on your new console now"""
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,Mindflux,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:26 2015 UTC,It's pretty much an indie game that they're selling to the more hardcore players that play often and still buy DLC. Any other sales are a bonus.
Dreamtheater,3d4qy4,Crysalim,-1,Mon Jul 13 23:58:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I just figured they killed this off because people were sick of it.

That was 5 and half years ago. I am actually crying now just typing this.... But the song that gets me so bad every single time is fatal tragedy.

It just doesn't feel as good as The Count of Tuscany or Octavarium to me. The Count of Tuscany is my favorite song just because of all the diversity in it. It's intro is so damn good that even people that hate metal and prog can't help but like it.  Talking about A Change of Seasons, I completely agree. Along with The Motherload by Mastodon, it's one of the few songs that, while it sounds like sometime up-beat or a generic, inspirational song, or epic in ACOS's case, it's backstory is so emotional that it always makes me tear up thinking about it. After I found out about the backstory, so many lyrics made sense, like the whole thing with Seize the Day and the movie sampling in the song. But the ""preparing for her flight"" segment completely changed. I never really got what that was supposed to mean, but now that I know, just thinking about it makes me a bit emotional. Even though it's not my favorite song or epic by DT, out of all of the emotional songs I have ever heard, this one tops all of them. I've never heard a song convey the feelings of the lyricist properly until I truly experienced A Change of Seasons."
Dreamtheater,3cr16k,52kirby9,3,Fri Jul 10 02:34:12 2015 UTC,True yo. So true. Octavarium is a close second though.

Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,turdburgers,18,Wed Jul 8 23:49:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd have to say Octavarium, not just because it leads into The Root of All Evil, but it just summarizes the whole album AMAZINGLY. They somehow got a little of each song from the album into the title track, and that's always amazing to me. It makes it seem as if every song is just a warm-up for Octavarium the song.   Finally Free is a very close second to me, because it's the perfect way to end a concept album, with a twist, and the way that the ending just happens is great, especially with the addition of leading into The Glass Prison."
Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,killedtherock,7,Thu Jul 9 00:55:53 2015 UTC,I totally agree. Petrucci's solo ending the song puts me in a state of bliss.

Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,karmisson,3,Thu Jul 9 14:13:30 2015 UTC,Wow. Great question OP. Finally free with the twist ending??? But my heart wants to say Learning To Live. So good!!!!!!
Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,SiriusC,3,Thu Jul 9 01:25:41 2015 UTC,"The end of In The Name of God sounds like such a closer. Does that make sense? The dramatic piano. Octavarium also has a very rising crescendo that just... man... it defines ""dramatic ending"".   That said I really love Beneath the Surface. I liked that the album didn't end on an epic & was more of a somber & softer note.  But right now, Illumination Theory takes it for me."
Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,rab7,4,Thu Jul 9 02:28:26 2015 UTC,"I think Breaking All Illusions is actually the true closer, and Beneath the Surface is the end credits"
Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,SiriusC,2,Thu Jul 9 15:03:25 2015 UTC,I've actually thought the same thing. Or that it's maybe something like a mid or end credits scene. I often listen to them as one piece.

Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,CloudMountainJuror,3,Thu Jul 9 05:42:55 2015 UTC,Putting ItPoE so low on your list should be a punishable crime.  ;)
Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,toomuchf1re,2,Thu Jul 9 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"I would say Six Degrees, but that's less the album closer and more the main attraction of the entire album.  That being said, In the Presence of Enemies, hands down. Though Beneath the Surface gets an honorable mention for being one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and for taking me by complete surprise."
Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,PipeBeard,2,Thu Jul 9 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"In The Presence of Enemies. Dark and metal from start to finish.  The whole song is like an epic battle of good against evil. A 25 minute adventure where all parts of the song connect so well that time slows down and it's not even like you are listening to the song, but experiencing the rise, fall, and redemption of the dark pilgrim."
Dreamtheater,3cm4ce,Scitron,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:24:54 2015 UTC,"11 is Beneath the Surface, which is probably the weak link of the bunch  This is a tough one, I feel like they're all so good. Probably Octavatium, but I absolutely love ITPOE2 and illumination Theory (especially the piano outro)"

My top 3 would probably be Octavarium, In the Name of God, and Finally Free. Octavarium and Finally Free because of how they tie together the entire album and finish their respective album in a great way. In the Name of God is just a good song that has an end of album feel in the outro, which is why they used to end concerts on it."

Dreamtheater,3cle29,drrd777,3,Thu Jul 9 22:06:31 2015 UTC,"Probably some average songs that nobody thinks about are 6:00, Voices, Just Let Me Breathe. Probably most of the stuff on the latest album except for Illumination theory."

This sub tends to skew towards everything written after SFAM but there was some epic stuff on Awake and FII.  I think their songwriting was more exploratory too, especially with Voices."

I love it, don't get me wrong, have both albums, but it's not DT. It's very... improvised; there is no thoughtful composition or arrangements or anything like that."
Dreamtheater,3ciyfl,Florinator,5,Wed Jul 8 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not quite the same as DT, but saying it has no thoughtful composition is just wrong. Yes a lot of it is improvised, but that doesn't mean discussions didn't take place at all about what structure they would use, where changes would be, what key it's in, etc. I especially love LTE2 since it feels somewhat more structured than LTE1, and the production quality is a bit higher. And JP's distortion..."
Dreamtheater,3ciyfl,the_boomr,4,Wed Jul 8 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"I especially love LTE2 since it feels somewhat more structured than LTE1   I feel the same way, actually."
Dreamtheater,3ciyfl,Florinator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:52:46 2015 UTC,That's interesting because the 2nd album was actually less structured. First album has a lot of written pieces. Paradigm shift and universal mind among others. I remember them talking about it but I wish I could remember where it was...
Dreamtheater,3ciyfl,ufosarereal51,3,Fri Jul 17 23:35:24 2015 UTC,Tony Levin required that the band literally Jam on CD. that's what 3 minute warning is... improvisation. and I'm half joking about LTE being better. I just think Levin's fat bass and all instrumental songs made LTE super beefy. like when the water breaks? how can One deny that?
Dreamtheater,3ciyfl,TFOLLT,4,Wed Jul 8 19:43:54 2015 UTC,Haha when I discovered LTE I was out of my mind. Haken is the only other one that comes close too though.
Dreamtheater,3ciyfl,TFOLLT,4,Wed Jul 8 07:57:36 2015 UTC,love HAKEN. They will likely be next generations masters of progressive metal.

I'm not into the new album much at all, I really tried, but there's something missing, probably MP. JR's keys are not up front anymore, and I just didn't get into any of the songs. Dramatic was good, but I'm worried that DTs success has led them to a point where they won't be making music for prog heads like me anymore. They have a much bigger fanbase now, and I might be a minority in saying that I want proggier, weirder, and crazier music. like anything up until octavarium, after that the albums started sliding downhill :["

Dreamtheater,3ce5y0,kakacha,7,Tue Jul 7 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"The Shattered Fortress. I always felt that it was just an okay track, given that all it does is pretty much wrap up the Twelve Step Suite by revisiting many parts of previous songs. Not bad, but nothing special.   But after seeing it on Breaking the Fourth Wall, I gained a new appreciation for the song. It definitely felt stronger in a live setting than it does on the album. Still not as strong some of the other Twelve Step Suite songs, but I like it much more now than I originally did."
Dreamtheater,3ce5y0,IceBlueSilverSky,2,Tue Jul 7 18:55:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. That's one of those off of Breaking the Fourth Wall where I wonder why people say Mangini is stale. I watched this about a week ago and holy shit he's into it.

Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,RTNMatute,32,Sun Jul 5 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"A Nightmare to Remember has personally one of the heaviest openings in modern metal, and ""bathing in beautiful agony"" is one of the best soft sections dt has ever written.  A Rite of Passage is groovy throughout the whole song and has a seriously good instrumental section.  Wither is a classically constructed DT radio ballad. Nothing amazing but its not bad either.  The Shattered Fortress has become a staple to DT's metal side. Its the song you want to blast as loud as bloody possible no matter where you are. In my personal opinion i think it features some of Jordan Rudess's best playing. Its pure metal synth at its best. Seeing it live on their last tour was literally a dream come true.  The Best of Times feels a little forced throughout. Like the emotion was being laid on too heavy and didnt sound natural. On the other hand it has one of JP's best solos. Its a true testament to his ability to combine passion, shredding, and technique all in one solo without sounding like tryhard wanking.  The Count of Tuscany needs no explanation. The lyrics may be cheesy but the music behind it is some of the best DT will ever write. It has my all time favourite keyboard riff in the opening and some of the best drumming MP could have pulled off.  Overall the album is actually really good but falls due to dumb musical cliche's that DT fans wouldnt expect from them and thus gets thrown to the back of the bus."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,SneakyNoob,6,Sun Jul 5 23:03:24 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you except basically on The Best of Times.  I can totally understand your view though; lyrically speaking, I can definitely understand it being ""laid on too heavy.""  It was such a personal song for MP to write, and it's laid out pretty straight-forward.  Compositionally, though, there's no question that it's definitely one of the band's best ""ballads"" in their whole discography.  And, yes, The Shattered Fortress live was absolutely incredible.  BC&SL was the album that got me into DT.  Good times."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,imawesumm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:16:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think Mike just got too specific with the lyrics instead of remaining appropriately ambiguous. Examples include mentioning stickball games and watching Harold and Maude...Kind of too much and makes the song harder to relate to, IMO."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,Synchestra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"He's always been one for writing personally meaningful songs, but the quality of that writing has definitely slipped since A Change Of Seasons."

I highly doubt it was unintentional: but when listening to the suite completely through, my personal opinion is that the contrast between the opening and ending track enhances the album."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,Snidernomore,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"I think the reason for that is that MP himself admitted he thought the whole 12 Step Suite felt forced from him as early as Root of All Evil, like it was something he didn't really want to keep doing but felt urged to.  The fact that he wasn't really into it is apparent in the track, but its nonetheless an incredibly satisfying conclusion to that incredible suite."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,silverpanther17,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:49:18 2015 UTC,"I never heard that before, but it makes perfect sense to me.  Starting with Root of All Evil, it's obvious that MP was just not into it anymore."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,locriology,5,Tue Jul 7 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Just posted about the mix on Luna Park and how you can't hear the keys. This album is the same. If you listen to the stems, especially for TBoT and TCoT, JR wrote and performed these beautiful orchestral parts, with huge strings, brass and choir. But you can hardly hear them under the rest of the band.   To my mind, this is one of the worst influences MP had on the band. He played a large part as ""architect"" of the arrangements and as a producer. Combined with his increasing push towards a more metal sound, the keys were relegated to bring buried."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,DevehJ,3,Sun Jul 5 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"And him pushing his goddamn rough vocals. ""By the Grace of God,  everyone survived, GRRRR!"" is the peak of my dislike for the Portnoy era."

Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,baddox,2,Thu Jul 9 04:45:14 2015 UTC,"A Nightmare to Remember is just an awesome metal song. As mentioned it is a bit cliche, but go goes with the theme of the album so by the time you reach the end you realize all of the songs are stories. A good album opener.  A Rite of Passage surprised me. It has cool riffs, solos, and has a catchy chorus. Not a bad song, but not great.  Wither is okay. Just okay. Even JP's solo is okay.  The Shattered Fortress has become one of my favorite songs (The Glass Prison is my favorite). Just the way it starts out, double bass drum, heavy riff and rudess synth, leading into that badass Dying Soul riff. It has such a good mix of all the AA songs and ends the suite perfectly, just like The Glass Prison began. This song really saves the album and is one of their best songs in their last couple albums.  The Best of Times was pretty cool but had Portnoy all over it. The song itself is cool, but forgettable. Didn't really feel like it fit into the album. But let's be honest, Petrucci kills the solo. The sweeping at the end blew my mind I literally didn't know what he was doing.  The Count of Tuscany is one of the best. An absolutely amazing epic that epitomizes who Dream Theater are. The end of this song is so beautifully done, the exact opposite of how the album starts off which is just perfect.  This album is isn't one of their best to listen as a new listener, but all Dream Theater fans will enjoy this album.   7/10"
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,toomuchf1re,2,Sat Jul 11 07:01:32 2015 UTC,"I warn you that it's my second DT album after IAW so I'll be a bit biased. This is one of my favorites. The Shattered Fortress is the best song for me. I heard it before the rest of the 12 step suite and it made a much  bigger impact on me than if I had geard the previous songs first. That intro is just monstrously epic.   The only big downsides to the album are Wither and A Rite Of Passage which are fun, but that's it. The rest is at least 9/10 *and TSF is 11/10 for me :D)"

Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,SuspiciousBulgarian,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:25:35 2015 UTC,One of my favourite albums. I think that all of the songs on it are awesome. Especially The Shattered Fortress.
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,SiriusC,0,Mon Jul 6 06:28:30 2015 UTC,"I really really disliked this album. The lyrics were embarrassingly straightforward & there's something about the mix turns me off.  Nightmare is too straightforward & features one of the cringiest moments in their entire career. I'm absolutely positive I don't need to point it out.   Passage I dig, but it's forgettable. I never think, ""gee, I would really like to listen to RoP right now"".   Wither is the song I like the most & it's ironic that it's about writer's block.   Fortress was a let down for me. It was too much of a copy & paste of all the other songs throughout the entire thing. I was hoping for a more original piece.   Times was the best musically, but suffers from straightforward & personally unrelatable lyrics.   Tuscany. Bad lyrics. Amazing ending. I've warmed up to it in the past couple of years.  Overall, this really made me dislike Mike Portnoy. I felt his control all over it. I was filled with hope when the news hit that they would carry on without him. And they've released & performed some of the best music I've ever heard in my entire life since."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,SinisterRectus,2,Mon Jul 6 00:29:04 2015 UTC,"The Shattered Fortress is the ending to the AA suite, it shouldn't be surprising that they reused motifs from the rest. There are parts of A Dramatic Turn of Events that sound too smiliar to previous DT songs when they shouldn't be related at all."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,SiriusC,3,Mon Jul 6 13:45:59 2015 UTC,"It's not surprising at all. All of the other songs used bits & pieces of previous songs. But I was hoping for something largely original with nods, not the entire thing being one big cut & paste."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,Synchestra,2,Mon Jul 6 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for something more original as well, especially considering such a short tracklist for the album (only 6 songs and one felt like a rehash outside of a few sweet riffs here and there)."
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,Mindflux,2,Mon Jul 6 19:46:55 2015 UTC,And they've released & performed some of the best music I've ever heard in my entire life since.   Nope. Just nope. Also dislike BC&SL but ADTOE and DT are just not up to snuff. They've gone from playing entirely intricate songs to saving any intricacy for JPs solos in the last two albums.
Dreamtheater,3c8lk6,SiriusC,2,Mon Jul 6 01:27:35 2015 UTC,In your opinion. Just like how many people love Black Clouds.  But I wasn't only talking about the albums. They seems so incredibly happy & it showed in their sets.

For more extended live DT jamming, check out Beyond This Life and Hollow Years from Live at Budokan.  They added an 8 minute improv solo section to the middle of an 11 minute song, and Hollow Years live is the Power Ballad Guitar Solo to end all Power Ballad Guitar Solos."
Dreamtheater,3c7dqt,w1ldm4n,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:38:33 2015 UTC,I still can't get over how awful the mix is. You can hardly hear the keys. JR is buried behind the guitar. It's like BCSL only worse.
Dreamtheater,3c7dqt,DevehJ,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:47:01 2015 UTC,I think it's great and really important that Dream Theater continue to do jams and improvisations in live situations. Their music is so composed and organised it's really refreshing when you're at a show and they whip something out. It's special because for that moment the audience are the only people who experience that moment.

They would release then every two years like clock work, it was such an exciting time. I cherished everyone, but there was always a sense that another one was coming, so I never considered, ""What if this one is the last?""  With the flux and drama in 2010, I was really worried that they'd all move on to other projects, or that for some reason they'd grow tired of DT and stop their production.  I'm so happy and we're all so fortunate that they're continuing their amazing run. I think Mike's energy has done wonders for the band's longevity, and James seems to be in a great place with his voice, which is a minor miracle in itself. His cords have a lot of mileage on them at this point, and I for one love how his sound has changed and matured.  It's a great time to be a DT fan.  See you at the next show!!!"

The 'Abducted by aliens' picture #21 is just the guitar intro of 'Bridges in the sky' LOL  So, no solos. But overall a really cool show, the lights were just amazing! LaBrie is in an amazing shape (and he did a couple funny jokes, too), Mangini is more proactive behind the kit, and the sound crew did an amazing job."

Dreamtheater,3bxr2o,RapeyTheSpermWhale,2,Fri Jul 3 01:50:29 2015 UTC,hey man thanks for the tip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVdzwLQJR0c  these guys right? imho that prog is indeed very similar to DT but the singer sounds like something in a pop-punk band such as sum41 blink182 or green day :/ Maybe a matter of adjustment
Dreamtheater,3bxr2o,52kirby9,3,Fri Jul 3 14:56:49 2015 UTC,The singer has that sound because he's 16 : P. They're all 15-16ish so I think his voice will get a bit better as they get older but the overall sound is great.   Edit: https://youtu.be/MeGlc4SMSkE

Dreamtheater,3bxr2o,52kirby9,2,Fri Jul 3 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'll list some of my favorite albums from my favorite bands.  An Endless Sporadic - Ameliorate (A really great EP that shows what kind of music they are going for. There are only for songs, but each song is incredibly diverse.)  Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here (Not much to say, really. Only 4 songs but Shine on You Crazy Diamond is not only my first epic, but still one of the best epics I have ever heard.)  Emerson, Lake & Palmer - Tarkus (Tarkus is probably my favorite non-DT epic. For a song made by three people, it feels like there is so much more. Plus, the other songs on the album are nice, but pale in comparison to Tarkus.)  Tool - Aenima/Lateralus (I'd recommend Lateralus more, since it is more proggy, but that doesn't mean Aenima isn't prog. Songs like Third Eye and 46 & 2 are fantastic prog metal songs that shouldn't be missed. Lateralus has Parabol/Parabola, Schism, and Lateralus, all of which are very proggy.)  Mastodon - Blood Mountain/Crack the Skye (I'd probably ignore Blood Mountain, because that album is very aggressive and not as progressive, but Crack the Skye is amazing. If you are not a fan of harsh vocals, only the title song on Crack the Skye has any of those (Half of Blood Mountain is harsh vocals). The two most stand out songs on the album are The Czar and The Last Baron, because they are the only songs above the 10 minute mark on the album. The Last Baron is definitely one of their best songs.)  Rush - A Farewell to Kings (Fucking love this album. It has the first part of my favorite song by them, Cygnus X-1, and it has so many other great songs. You'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing out on this album.)  Liquid Tension Experiment - Liquid Tension Experiment 2 (It was hard to pick between either of their two albums, since they are both high quality instrumental albums. However, LTE2, IMO, has the better songs. Acid Rain, Another Dimension, and When the Water Breaks show how great the band is when they plan stuff out. Chewbacca shows how great the band is when they improvise. In fact, I'd recommend checking out Liquid Trio Experiment's Spontaneous Combustion. It's all improv and it has no guitarist (Which means, sadly, no John Petrucci gracing us with his face-melting playing.), so it has an incredible experimental feel to it.)  Scale the Summit - The Migration (Another instrumental album. Every song feels like an adventure. Although you may not remember any song title, every song is memorable in their own way.)"
Dreamtheater,3bxr2o,Chexling,2,Fri Jul 3 15:03:48 2015 UTC,LTE is amazing. I think 2 is the best. So many good songs.

Dreamtheater,3bpig3,FranticJ3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I read, yeah.  While it's interesting, live performances they give it a better ending."
Dreamtheater,3bpig3,DreamPhase,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"If you look at the music and lyrics, the abrupt ending actually makes a lot of sense. The whole song is based off of Hamlet, and at the end of the song, Labrie is singing ""Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt,"" one note corresponding to one syllable. The pattern the band plays at the end is a four part pattern, and so they play it 2.5x to match up with the ten syllables of the lyrics. The song then ends apparently out of nowhere just after Labrie sings ""melt,"" but it makes a lot more sense logistically if you break it down.  TL;DR the abrupt ending in ""Pull Me Under"" actually makes sense if you examine it closely."
Dreamtheater,3bpig3,theverb2764,2,Wed Jul 1 20:52:41 2015 UTC,I suppose it does but I wish it wouldn't end so soon. It's such a good song.
Dreamtheater,3bpig3,DreamPhase,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Lyrically, yes, that is what it represents, but when they were composing it instrumentally before the lyrics were written, it was just that they were building up all this tension, and they had no idea what to do with it, so they decided to just pull the plug and give it a sudden ending(According to MP, it's sort of an homage to The Beatles)."
Dreamtheater,3bpig3,Robo4900,4,Thu Jul 2 09:15:43 2015 UTC,Yes! This is one of the first I heard by DT and I was instantly hooked from just the intro. I love that bass slide Myung does at 5:10. And the outro is so beautiful and phenomenal. This song kicks an infinite amount of ass.
Dreamtheater,3bpig3,TheFirstDegree,5,Wed Jul 1 03:12:02 2015 UTC,One of DT's heaviest and high energy songs. You can find live footage of it from right before MP left and it sounds absolutely massive with todays live quality.

Dreamtheater,3bo8ek,Kluuz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:22:00 2015 UTC,"Panic Attack and Constant Motion on Rock Band. Always loved those songs. Then one day I felt like diving into their discography and I saw they released a new album (ADToE). Listened to that over and over for weeks. Then I continued backwards. Black Clouds I really loved Count of Tuscany and Shattered Fortress. Listened to that album for awhile. Heard Octavarium which easily became my favorite song.   Then I heard Metropolis Pt. 2. Holy crap. No idea I could love something this much before. Loved how everything flowed so perfectly. It took me weeks to even realize it was a story, since I was just mostly rocking out so hard and didnt really pay attention to the lyrics and themes. But still this remains to be my favorite music album of all-time."
Dreamtheater,3bo8ek,90guys,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:28:38 2015 UTC,"I probably first heard Panic Attack off of Rock Band 2, but never paid attention to it until I started listening to DT.   What I consider the first song I listened to is As I Am. At the time I listened to mostly electronica at the time, like Owl City, and some rock, like 3 Doors Down and Crush 40. One day I was looking for the theme song for Shadow the Hedgehog (I was young, preteens I think,) called I Am (All of Me.) I forgot the second part and just put in I Am. I saw As I Am and thought it looked interesting.  I listened to it. It was a strange experience. It was just downright uncomfortable to listen to. I listened to all of it and decided to download it (again, I was young.) The guitar solo blew me away. I was amazed someone could play that ridiculously fast. I also couldn't wrap my head around an eight minute song. I made myself listen to the entire thing repeatedly. It slowly grew on me.  I found myself wanting more of that solo, I found my old songs to be boring and predictable. I googled top Dream Theater songs.   First result: Octavarium.  It was probably not the best starting point, but I think if it were anything else I wouldn't have gotten into DT, which is now my favourite band.  TL;DR: As I Am"

Dreamtheater,3bdaqn,npepin,8,Mon Jun 29 00:25:49 2015 UTC,"Almost all of them. I really like prog, but I rarely ever like a song on first listen. This is something I've just had to accept about myself. Prog music for me is like getting a haircut, I won't like it at first despite how good it is.   I listened to Octavarium, the song and the album, and I was pretty disappointed. I didn't really like Awake, with the exception of 6:00 and Voices. I couldn't figure out what was going on with Six Degrees. Images and Worlds seemed off in another world.   After future listens I ended up falling in love. This is something I know about myself, so I had full plans for future listens.  The only album I instantly liked from DT was Train of Thought, particularly: As I Am; Honor Thy Father; and In the Name of God.   A lot of their newer stuff is easier to get into, which is good because I am really impressed on the first listen, but is also kind of bad because the song doesn't really get better after the first listen. The other songs only get better as I listen.  I don't have this issue as much with less complex music as there isn't nearly as much to digest."
Dreamtheater,3bdaqn,maximumrocker,3,Sun Jun 28 04:39:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, this sounds a lot like me. Train of Thought was the album that got me into the band (oh my gosh, this is so heavy and technical and awesome - this is the best music I've heard in my life!), but now it's not anywhere close to my favorite album of theirs. I'm always underwhelmed when I listen to a new DT album, but now I know that I just need to hear it another 3-4 times before I realize how amazing it is."

And the new drummer stuff, of course.  I remember this all pretty vividly since it was a really great time in my life. So I'm hoping for the same here. Plus, it's album 13, which is a significant number for myself.  I'm willing to bet the new album will be announced very soon & we'll hear something new on this upcoming tour. Likely a single, too."

It's a festival tour so I guess they'll play shorter sets and since they'll likely be playing to a lot of non-fans or casuals, the set-list will probably be mostly more accessible ""hits"".  They didn't tour in 2013 before DT12 (or did they?), so I'm guessing this mini tour will delay #13 for a while. In January, JLB said there would hopefully be a ""late fall release'"". Depending on how you define 'fall', that could be as late as December."

I remember that being an oddity for their album/tour pattern. They usually go record, release album, tour, release live album, break, repeat. With the live album usually being a holdover for fans while they're on break. But Luna Park was delayed & released after DT12. And they didn't start touring for DT12 until 2014. Which I felt was extremely odd not only for them but for any band. To release an album & sit on it for months. Isn't a tour usually in support of a new album?  I'm willing to bet they'll ""beta test"" at least 1 new song on tour. They were doing festivals in the calm before Dramatic Turn & threw in On the Backs of Angels on their shorter sets. I'm also willing to bet we'll see a September release!  Care to take me up on either in a friendly internet bet?"
Dreamtheater,3aqiyk,SiriusC,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:52:37 2015 UTC,"Although I don't have any sources right now, I've read that they won't be playing new stuff during the tour. Also, with no anouncements on a possible release date, I'm guessing it won't be until late 2015/early 2016 before the new album is released."
Dreamtheater,3aqiyk,Kenny_dies,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:55:55 2015 UTC,Right now they are doing summer festivals in Europe. Its not a dedicated Dream Theater tour. They have a relatively short setlist because they share that stage(s) with up to 20 other bands. They might release a single and play it in Europe but nothing more.

Details such as placing right-wing audio samples on the right stereo track and left-wing audio samples on the left stereo track are pretty nifty. However, it's an ""epic"" song, not one easily digested. Unfortunately, with a polarizing issue such as embryonic stem cell research, their ambiguous lyrics (e.g. ""are you justified in taking life to save life"") are most likely interpreted as support for an opposing opinion by any ardent embryonic stem cell research supporter or opposer."

Dreamtheater,3aez5f,noahlauzier,10,Fri Jun 19 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, James has responded to this before, saying, ""These people are pathetic and need to move on. I say get a life and maybe work on making your life a better one instead of thinking the answer lies in cutting someone else up to raise your miserable spirit.""  I think most of it is unfair. Some of it makes sense. A lot of people think he doesn't fit in the band, which is a reasonable claim. Then there are the people that outright say he is terrible and should be replaced by someone who would never fit in the band or just quit. People don't realize he is a vital part of the band and without him, the band might fall under. Okay, it won't be as bad if James left compared to Mike leaving, but that's the thing. MP was a vital part and now JP has to take care of so many things for the band. If James leaves, JP will have more pressure to deal with, unless someone else in the band steps up."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,52kirby9,8,Fri Jun 19 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think MM is terrible, far from it. I just think he wasn't the right pick for DT. His skills are amazing, but after seeing him live and watching him play, he just isn't quite a prog metal drummer. He's basically just drumming out sheet music without any real style. He's almost TOO perfect in his play. Portnoy knew how to stylize."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,IThoughtThisWasDigg,2,Fri Jun 19 20:06:51 2015 UTC,"Could you give an example of this? Perhaps link to two samples, one for Portnoy & one for Mancini?   I've heard what you're saying over & over again on this subreddit but I am just not hearing it. I've been very moved by Mangini's playing & he brings lots of positive energy to live shows. You can see how happy grateful, & fulfilled he is. And I've always seen Portnoy as a bit of a diva & egocentric.  But hey, I'm always willing to have my mind opened."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,SiriusC,5,Fri Jun 19 22:41:23 2015 UTC,This is an example for me. I'm not a drummer or a good musician by any measure so I don't really know if what Mangini is doing is technically harder or more skilled than Portnoy's. But purely as a fan that outro just didn't have the same flair and sounds deflated the way Mangini did it. I mean Portnoy might just be doing the same sort of fills over and over again or just playing loud or whatever but it's a big moment in the song (and the album) and Portnoy lives up to the moment with his energy IMO.
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,Delinquent_Turtle,5,Sat Jun 20 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair:    Portnoy co-wrote that song. He's going to be naturally more passionate about playing it. There's much more emotion in it for him.  For all we know, on older material at least, Mangini may choose to go by the book, rather than improvising, out of respect for MP's writing and fans.  Portnoy has always been a ""front-man"" kind of live player...from his attitude on stage and off stage...just look at him in interviews. Mangini seems to be a quieter, more reserved type of person.    FWIW, I've liked what Mangini's done thus far. I feel like, if anything, Portnoy was actually sending the band down the ""grumbly boring metal"" path with their song-writing and structure (just look at his follow-on projects). With Mangini, it seems like the band's reversed course back to a slightly more progressive writing style.   Would love to hear some counterpoints."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,tippocalypse,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:03:40 2015 UTC,"In the documentary from when the band was choosing the drummer, they actually specifically stated that one reason they chose Mangini is because he played everything exactly how it was originally on the albums, and they wanted a drummer like that who was going to fully respect Portnoy's work, the fans, and the body of previous material, instead of improvising over things and making it sound different."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,the_boomr,0,Tue Jun 23 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"You didn't have any counterpoints. Portnoy's attitude and ""front-man"" ways were part of what made him a great musician for a great show.   FWIW, I've liked what Mangini's done thus far. I feel like, if anything, Portnoy was actually sending the band down the ""grumbly boring metal"" path with their song-writing and structure (just look at his follow-on projects). With Mangini, it seems like the band's reversed course back to a slightly more progressive writing style.    And you would not be in the majority of Dream Theater fans that like the direction the band has gone post-Portnoy. Even with you did, Mangini would not be the person to credit that."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,Snidernomore,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:23:34 2015 UTC,"It's just their personality.  Portnoy has always had a loud, fiery personality, while Mangini is more quiet and reserved."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,JMAN365,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"Basically, Portnoy was more showy. That link you provided is a perfect perfect example of this difference. I'm fairly certain when the band hired Mangini, one of the positives of him for them is the fact that he doesn't try to be a front-man, leading the show. In situations like this, it's clear that he is simply not going to the same lengths to fill the music with ridiculous drum fills for 99% of the outro. Now...if I were to speculate, I'd guess that the band kinda wants him to keep playing that way, so they don't feel like it's another Portnoy situation happening again, because I think at the end, Portnoy was getting too over-controlling. For me personally, I wish Mangini weren't quite this limited by that factor; however, aside from maybe slightly less interesting drum fills, in every other respect, I feel that this makes Mangini a much better drummer in the context of DT. From my perspective and opinion. Feel free to disagree, I'm just pointing out my own speculations and the things that I personally like to hear in Dream Theater's music.  Also, speaking as a trained musician, Mangini is easily capable of exactly the same fills that Portnoy could play, he just obviously chose not to, for whatever reason. We may not know the reason, ever. Oooh...although I just thought, at that particular performance, they had the choir and everything too...so perhaps, just perhaps, he kept it relatively low-key just to make sure the choir wouldn't get confused and off-beat.  Also as someone else mentioned below, Mangini did not write that song, so it's reasonable to assume that he doesn't feel quite the same level of passion for that specific material that Portnoy did, and he isn't going to improv on the spot in exactly the same way Portnoy would have. They're different people."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,the_boomr,0,Tue Jun 23 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"I think the comparison in that video is a little ridiculous. There are clearly different audio bit rates - the first clip sounded shallow throughout, not just the drums. Ignoring the playing, your ear is already biased by the difference in the quality of the sound. The second clip was clearly mixed, audio and video, to feature the drum solo, which helps Portnoy's efforts stand out. Further, the drum solo off of live scenes was one of Portnoy's best (imo), and that recording was the end of an epic show on an epic tour for an epic album - Mangini didn't have the same build up. Lastly, Portnoy was 33 when Live Scenes was recorded - I have my doubts he could recapture the same passion and energy near 50 as he could as a young man."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,leetnewb,0,Sun Jun 21 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"Mike Mangini made  Lifting Shadows off a Dream, Trial of Tears, and Lie more interesting than Portnoy ever did when played live. Compare Trial of Tears from Live at Budokan and then Breaking the Fourth wall.  Mangini made it so much better.   Portnoy's problem is that he didnt know when to hold back. I watch that finally free video and get bored with portnoys performance because its just a different style of technical wankery while Mangini keeps it calm and reserved, switching styles while staying technical but not trying to blast his toms like portnoy at 10000bpm."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,SneakyNoob,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:44:49 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that about Mangini, since I first heard him with Vai in the '90s. His technical skill is unquestionably tremendous, but his style has always struck me as being cold and sterile."

Dreamtheater,3aez5f,the_boomr,6,Mon Jun 22 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons JLB made solo albums was to show people that he can write music as well. He can come up with riffs and melodies. And the proof is in the pudding, people buy his solo albums and go to his solo concerts. As far as I'm concerned, I could not imagine DT without JLB. He is as much part of the signature DT sound as JP's riffs and Mike's drummimg (see what I did there?)   Besides, he's a very cool guy. I bought the VIP package at one of their concerts and got to shake their hands and talk to them. JLB has a ""nice guy"" vibe. And I am convinced JM is actually a ninja; at another concert, at the end, I was right in front of the stage and did fist bumps with the guys, except for JM who wanted to shake hands (arm wrestling style), but almost dislocated my shoulder with his super-human strength :-) I kid you not, he lifted me a foot off the ground.  In the Lifting Shadows book the band talks about JLB's audition back in the day. He used to be in a band called Winter Rose and sent DT a tape and a photo. The guys were blown away by his vocal abilities (remember, Charlie Dominici was almost 20 years older than the rest of the band)* and thought he's probably a mega-douche because of his great looks. They couldn't believe how nice he was when they invited him to New York.  Also, I'm not sure how many people know this, but JLB got food poisoning while on vacation in Mexico, threw up and messed up his vocal chords. His doctor told him he won't be singing again. It took years for him to recover, with therapy and such. Yeah, I fucking love JLB and I fucking love DT. BEST BAND EVAHHH!!!  Edit: * if you look into the band history you will see how difficult it was for them to get a singer that was right for them. They wanted a very specific style, high pitch, clean vocals and JLB fit the bill perfectly. They were desperate and almost got to the point where they discussed disbanding simply because they couldn't find the singer they wanted. And it's not like they didn't try, they did..."
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,Robo4900,2,Fri Jun 19 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"The main reason it took so damn long for JLB to recover from that vocal injury was the fact that he went on tour mere weeks after it happened, strictly against multiple doctor's orders...and the band even told him they would cancel the tour, wait for him to get better before doing anything else. But he was like FUCK IT I'LL SEE YOU ON THE ROAD"
Dreamtheater,3aez5f,the_boomr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"From what I hear, after his food poisoning he discussed it with the band, and none of them really wanted to postpone the tour(Although I'm sure they'd have gone along with it if he wanted to)."

I can only think of 5 bands that, in my opinion, do them right, those being Mastodon, Baroness, The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Fall of Troy, and Children of Bodom. But even with CoB, I just got into them this week, so I'm new to death metal growling."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,enndeee,3,Sat Jun 20 02:58:50 2015 UTC,"If you're into Dream Theater, Haken, or Native Construct, you'll dig the album. It edges way closer to prog than actual metal while staying pretty damn heavy."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,52kirby9,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:15:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that info. I'll try to keep that in mind when it comes out. I'm always looking to expand my selection of music, so it'll be a great thing for me if it turns out as an album I like."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,enndeee,2,Sat Jun 20 03:21:03 2015 UTC,Have you tried listening to Opeth? I think their growls are superb!
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,52kirby9,2,Sat Jun 20 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"That is what turns me off from them. I want to appreciate their music, but as it currently stands, I just can't tolerate Mikael's growling. Although, I love their prog rock stuff, especially Death Whispered a Lullaby and Eternal Rains Will Come."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,the_boomr,2,Sat Jun 20 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, Darn.  Well, I wasnt a huge fan of grown vocals for a long time. Kind of eased my way into it. Not for everyone, maybe you'll come around to enjoy it one day."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,52kirby9,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This year was the first time in my life that I found harsh vocals I liked. Starting with Blood Mountain by Mastodon. The others came along afterwards. But the reason I like those vocals is because they aren't too guttural. I don't think of Mastodon's vocals as growling, but more as extremely aggressive singing."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,the_boomr,2,Sat Jun 20 15:20:20 2015 UTC,Don't forgot Tesseract and also MP's metal album!!!
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,52kirby9,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about those, but it reminded me that MP's kid's album is coming out soon, unless that is the MP album you are talking about."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,the_boomr,3,Sat Jun 20 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"No, MP has a allstar Metal Allegiance album coming out... Lineup looks killer Check it out"
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,52kirby9,2,Sat Jun 20 01:46:28 2015 UTC,"I have listened to both Next To None and Metal Allegiance albums and they kick ass. Well, MA was just the rough mix and it was missing some of the vocals in a couple of songs, but I really liked it... It was what I expected for Adrenaline Mob to be.  And Next To None... It's a mix of Kevin Moore era DT with Slipknot. Those kids are going places... Thomas, the keyboard and vocalist is a really good songwriter. And Max has all the ""flair"" his dad has and I think he will be an even better drummer very soon."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,MeadPopsicle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:26:42 2015 UTC,"Oh crap, I didn't know they were releasing an album. I thought that was like a one time thing. That cover of Seek and Destroy they did was amazing."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,MeadPopsicle,2,Sat Jun 20 01:50:02 2015 UTC,"Oooh, new Symphony X? Will have to check that out. Haven't been particularly thrilled with their newer stuff but I always give it a listen just to see what it's like."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,imawesumm,2,Tue Jun 23 21:41:04 2015 UTC,Here's a taste of the new album.
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,LegendaryStickMan,2,Tue Jun 23 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I really like that chorus. I prefer hearing his clean voice a lot more than his growls, and that major tonality is awesome in this track's chorus. We'll see how the rest of the album turns out!"
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,RapeyTheSpermWhale,2,Tue Jun 23 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"No problem, man. We only have to wait 4 weeks and 3 days for it to be released."

Dreamtheater,3aedz2,IThoughtThisWasDigg,2,Tue Jun 23 22:06:46 2015 UTC,"I'm hyped, can't you tell. WOO!"
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,Victory___,5,Tue Jun 23 22:09:53 2015 UTC,I'm afraid not. In 2 recent interviews (for a Polish magazine and website) JP said that they'll probably release it in early 2016.
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,rab7,5,Fri Jun 19 18:17:50 2015 UTC,Do you have a link?
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,Victory___,4,Fri Jun 19 19:24:45 2015 UTC,Link
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,enndeee,3,Fri Jun 19 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"I would assume so, sometime towards the end of the year (September at the earliest) since DT12 (the self-titled most recent album) came out September of not last year but the year before.  They've tended to adhere pretty well to a two-year schedule of releasing a new album and then touring."
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,Mindflux,5,Fri Jun 19 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"[Translated using Google Translate]  Apparently we won't get the album this year.  Interviewer: From what I know, right at that moment you are - you are working on a new album Dream Theater, which is expected in autumn.  Petrucci: Perhaps early next year.  Interviewer: Can you tell us about the new songs? The previous album [entitled ""Dream Theater""] Set bar really high.  Petrucci: Thank you, it's nice what you say. It's hard to talk about music, which is only just born, so I never do. We work very hard and we are excited about the new material. That's all.  But for me the most exciting news from the interview:   Interviewer: A decade ago, you released your debut solo album ""Suspended Animation"". You are about to record his successor?  Petrucci: Yes, very soon. It is not easy, because most of my professional time I devote to the band.  Source Thanks to /u/MeadPopsicle"
Dreamtheater,3aedz2,Florinator,3,Fri Jun 19 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of ok with this. If they want to take extra time to perfect it and don't want it to feel rushed, I say let them."

Dreamtheater,3a05yj,rab7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"You read wrong. In Chasing Shadows, the band says they chose those two songs themselves, feeling they were the best ballads they had written up to that time.  Edit: I remembered wrong. The band chose those two songs over ""To Live Forever"". ""Don't Look Past Me"" wasn't mentioned in that part of the book. Sorry about that!"
Dreamtheater,3a05yj,SinisterMinisterX,3,Tue Jun 16 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Ah I see.  Thanks for clearing that up. Also, it's Lifting Shadows not Chasing"
Dreamtheater,3a05yj,rab7,2,Tue Jun 16 15:51:21 2015 UTC,"They wrote Pull Me Under, Surrounded, and Another Day between the initial demoing/recording of the album(Apparently the label was being strange). They chose to swap out To Live Forever and Don't Look Past Me for Surrounded, Another Day, and Pull Me Under. The band still wanted to put A Change Of Seasons on the album, but the label thought it would take things ""Too far"", so they cut it with the intention of releasing it as an EP later, which -- as we all know -- they did."
Dreamtheater,3a05yj,Robo4900,4,Thu Jul 2 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"Cleaning out the Closet is in my top 5 DT albums for sure. Maybe even #3, behind Images and Awake.   LOVE LOVE LOVE the style of all the songs on Cleaning out the closet...much better than falling into infinity by far"
Dreamtheater,3a05yj,YoshiYogurt,2,Tue Jun 16 05:52:14 2015 UTC,I LOVE this track. It reminds me of something from a Broadway Rock Opera.

Dreamtheater,39pczo,DoubleChicken,9,Sat Jun 13 13:19:42 2015 UTC,"They get hate amongst big prog metal fans for the same reason that Explosions in the Sky gets hate amongst big post-rock fans. The band is seen as ""babby's first prog metal"". A lot of people think it's intro-level stuff and that there is more interesting stuff going on deeper in the genre.  I don't disagree that other bands are doing great things, but I think that's a very stupid reason to dislike a band."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,mfranko88,18,Sat Jun 13 22:42:48 2015 UTC,It's because they're not BtBaM which is the newest prog metal jerk off band du jour.

Dreamtheater,39pczo,RodRevenge,2,Sat Jun 13 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"I love BtBaM for the melodies, and I think that their music would be much better if you just ignore the growls. Also, their lyrics have lots of content, if you ever read them out."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,PongForTheWin,2,Sat Jun 13 16:25:02 2015 UTC,Melodic growling should be a new sub-sub genre of prog metal.

Dreamtheater,39pczo,rab7,2,Sat Jun 13 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sure DT also just thought all the drummers were really cool and wanted to give them exposure themselves (Mangini practically had the job already from what I've heard). I could easily see the other band members doing a side project with Marco, especially if it was an LTE-style jazz fusion group."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,schleppylundo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:47:08 2015 UTC,JR did do a side project with Marco! Levin Minneman Rudess is the name of the album :)
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,10,Wed Jun 17 05:57:16 2015 UTC,Mangini is from Northeast US. He has a good head on his shoulders. He's an amazing drummer.
Dreamtheater,39pczo,cth1ic_warrior,13,Sat Jun 13 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"He's almost ""too"" technical for this band in my opinion. They need someone who can put out energy and entertain people during the live show. Right now they look bored on stage.  I also dislike Mangini's kit and his horrible sounding snare/cymbals."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,Alkalilee,9,Sat Jun 13 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"I have seen them twice with mangini and I never saw boredom... When I saw them it was always very energetic and they fed off the crowd. Especially mangini, JP, and Jordan. JM not so much, but hey that's part of his mystique."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,BCJunglist,9,Sat Jun 13 19:36:19 2015 UTC,"MM's kit and style makes seeing him boring. Because of the symmetry or his kit and because of his insane hand speed he plays every song without literally having to move his body. Portnoy would bounce around, change kits mid song, get up, do stick tricks, and get the crowd going. I loved him for his showmanship and for the drive he brought to their music. DT replaced him with a ""better"" drummer, but a mediocre musician."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,Alkalilee,2,Sat Jun 13 19:44:49 2015 UTC,Word.
Dreamtheater,39pczo,knoerfw,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"Mediocre musician? Not even. I could let you get by with specifically calling MM a less interesting, or worse, ""showman,"" but musician? No. MM is a much better musician than MP. Imo, at least. You have to agree he's at least on level, though."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:59:51 2015 UTC,"Mangini is stuck up with all of the math DT's been trying to do lately. Before they'd let the odd time sigs come naturally. Mangini is part of the reason you now need a calculator to listen to DT. Illumination Theory had the potential to be a great song but it got absolutely destroyed by the instrumental passages (I'm not really a fan of the random string interlude either, but it would work better as its own piece)."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,Alkalilee,3,Wed Jun 17 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"While I'm not a huge fan of DT12, I didn't feel any ""forced mathematical"" stuff at all. There is some ridiculously complicated stuff in quite old DT music, you might just feel like it's ""more natural"" because you've been hearing it longer, or the melodies suit your tastes better, or whatever other reasons there may be. Examples like Dance of Eternity, Metropolis Pt 1, A Change of Seasons, Erotomania, and more come to mind."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:29:04 2015 UTC,Don't need to start listing songs. I know them well. They didn't write any of them thinking how x measures of y/z time signature would let the drummer do a time sig in one hand and b sig in the other. That's what I call forcing it. Listen to some of the recent DT interviews and that's exactly what they're doing.
Dreamtheater,39pczo,Alkalilee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"They didn't do that before because Portnoy isn't capable of it. When you're a highly trained musician, you tend to want to do as much as you are technically able to, and I have no problem with that. Classical music is riddled with similar things like piano parts specifically written so the pianist is playing different meters in each hand, or multi-tonality. This is nothing new."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,3,Wed Jun 17 18:13:52 2015 UTC,"MM himself doesn't get bored, it's just his style of play is really.....vanilla and mechanical. He's not fun to listen to compared to Portnoy. MM just feels like a drum machine/metronome. Portnoy knew how to put on a damn show."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,IThoughtThisWasDigg,4,Mon Jun 15 02:31:27 2015 UTC,"What you mean is, Portnoy knew how to add ""energy"" to live performances by speeding way the fuck up and screwing JP on his already insanely difficult guitar solos."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,3,Wed Jun 17 05:58:38 2015 UTC,"Portnoy's tendency to rush does bother me on their live DVDs, but to be fair - I think they use a metronome now, so Mangini doesn't really have the option of speeding up.  Not that he would...the guy is a human metronome anyway!"
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,2,Wed Jun 17 15:40:46 2015 UTC,"They do use a click-track now, true. That's actually one of the most disappointing things they've done with Mangini, I really wish I could hear his perfect timekeeping live, but alas, we'll never know if what they say is true about his impeccable sense of timing :/"
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,3,Wed Jun 17 15:51:38 2015 UTC,"Using a metronome live is one of the few things in music I go back and forth on, regarding whether it's ""okay"" or not...but I've seen Mangini play tons of other stuff and I'm pretty convinced the guy is actually a machine."

The complexity of their work is definitely growing, so I bet that they really need to pay a lot of attention to what they're doing on stage now. Maybe?"
Dreamtheater,39pczo,shibbypwn,5,Sat Jun 13 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"That's a problem I've found. They're trying too hard to make music complex rather than have it come naturally. For instance, Octavarium flows much better to me than Illumination Theory does."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,Alkalilee,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:41:12 2015 UTC,"Is it the kit, or the production? I feel like everything has been over compressed since Mangini joined."

Dreamtheater,39pczo,MysteriumDei,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:12:54 2015 UTC,I didn't get the chocolate cake vibe at all on DT12. I didn't like JP's sound for any of his solos either.

Dreamtheater,39pczo,clipperdylan6,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:25:01 2015 UTC,heh. Marco Minnemann went on to play drums for my best friend's brother's band Psyaxis for a little while.
Dreamtheater,39pczo,clipperdylan6,9,Tue Jun 23 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of reasons, but a big one for me is that they've gradually shifted from writing complex arrangements and have started to rely more on long solo sections - the difference between songs from, say Awake, which are all pretty short in length but very intricate, versus an album like ADToE which relies on these huge song lengths caused by instrumental/solo sections.  Basically, imo, sometimes they rely on JP/JR solos to much nowadays."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,wheeloflime,3,Sat Jun 13 13:45:31 2015 UTC,"I know man, it's so stupid. Some people really just need to appreciate DT and how they consistently make incredible music.

Dreamtheater,39pczo,JohnnyRussell,3,Sun Jun 14 07:49:35 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the Progreport post, then no one was ""shitting on DT"". There were opinions that some albums were better/worse than others, but nobody was trashing their work as a whole.   Sure, maybe once in a blue moon someone comes along and says everything they've done sucks, but considering how diverse Dream Theater's discography is, it's no surprise when people say they dislike x album. Seriously, pick any album, and you'll find at least one person who says it's their favorite (yes, even FII and WDADU) and someone who says it's their worst (yes, even Images and Scenes).  The criticism should come as a testament of how much influence the band has, and how high a standard they've set that people are upset when they feel an album doesn't reach it."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,2,Sat Jun 13 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best answer to the original question on this thread. I was going to post something myself, but you said it all right here.  Your point about diversity of albums is a very good one. It means that every fan has an unpopular opinion that goes against the grain of what the majority of fans think (i.e. Octavarium is one of my least favorite DT albums).  Bands that you can either love or hate 100% without listening to all their music are too boring to be discussed as much as DT is.  :)"
Dreamtheater,39pczo,helgihermadur,3,Wed Jun 17 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that while some people think, like what some others said, that the songs are too technical for the sake of being technical or that they were so much better with portnoy and its just not the same anymore, the biggest thing that everyone hates is James Labrie's voice. Maybe its not the prog community im thinking of but just more in general music (and especially metal) community, people can handle the music but cant stand James's voice. Hell, we even had that thread on here a few days ago talking about it, it just rubs some people the wrong way. But definitely almost every single time I've seen Dream Theater discussed on reddit, whether its r/askreddit, r/guitar, r/metal, /r/music and even sometimes r/progmetal, the thing that is always brought up is his voice."
Dreamtheater,39pczo,the_boomr,3,Sat Jun 13 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's because they've become too popular. I've also seen a lot of people who praise them to no end as the ultimate band, the epitome of perfection, the best possible music, etc. (I used to be one of those).   So now much more people are being exposed to DT with those unrealistically high expectations and, since they will justifiably not be met for everyone, feel the need to point out every single thing they don't like about the band. This is now much more exaggerated because of Portnoy's departure and the direction the band has taken.  TL;DR: Hype kills."

The criticism has really only come in recently, more specifically post Portnoy. DT is one of my favorite bands of all time, but ever since Portnoy left I really find myself struggling to listen to their newer stuff. BCSL was a fantastic album and I'm glad Portnoy ended on a high note, but all of DT's albums with Mangini really have been somewhat of a struggle for me to enjoy. Respect to Mangini, as everyone knows he is an incredible musician and songwriter, but DT isn't DT without Portnoy IMO"

The CD has this in the pre-track. The list itself is wrong, because there are only 5 hidden tracks (between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 6 and 7).  I have both physical and digital copies of the album, and nothing is missing from either one."

Additionally, every song is in the key of that note. Root is in F, The Answer Lies Within is in G, and so on until Octavarium in F again."
Dreamtheater,39pqxq,2_Wycked,2,Sun Jun 14 18:04:37 2015 UTC,Is the music key of each song confirmed? It makes sense but I've always wondered how people were sure about it -- did DT release the sheet music or something?
Dreamtheater,39pqxq,rab7,3,Mon Jun 15 03:36:02 2015 UTC,It is extremely easy to tell  Edited to add: No sheet music necessary.  Listen to the album with a piano or a piano app and just keep smashing the same note over and over.

It's added onto the other tracks as has been explained and adds a little (even more) continuity to the whole album. The extra bits can sometimes seem a bit out of place and ""in the way"" if it's just one of the songs popping up in a shuffle list, not really a huge deal though at all.

Dreamtheater,39exd0,x1n30,-2,Thu Jun 11 12:40:39 2015 UTC,"JLB was absolutely awesome and from this day I do think he's a A++ vocalist.    Not surprising that this is the top answer on the Dream Theater subreddit but... no. There's no way that LaBrie in an A++ singer, nevermind an ""A"" singer at this point of his career.  He is wildy inconsistent from song to song, nevermind show to show. Chaos in Motion? Luna Park? Breaking the Fourth Wall? A few songs you just can't listen to with him singing, and half of them he ruins parts of them by trying to hit the same high note.  Is he awful? Far from it. He still has really good performances, such as Score, or some off of Breaking the Fourth Wall. But LaBrie is old now and doesn't have the natural power he once had. DT fans get defensive and go way over the top with responses like these.  In the 90's? Absolutely. But LaBrie is one of the biggest complains of people who aren't active fans of the band. Objectively, again, I don't know how you can call someone with such a varied liking within active fans, nevermind outside them, an A+++ vocalist."
Dreamtheater,39exd0,Snidernomore,2,Thu Jun 11 20:53:03 2015 UTC,Did you see them perform live last year?
Dreamtheater,39exd0,DTown13,0,Thu Jun 11 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"I saw him 4 times on the last tour. I really don't understand those comments saying that he improved his live performances. To me he will always be the weak link on DT.  Edit: also, since MP left there is a lot of playback being used live."
Dreamtheater,39exd0,cjhazza,8,Thu Jun 11 22:49:58 2015 UTC,Putting aside the issues JLB has had with his voice which obviously coloured a lot of people's opinions (especially if you saw him live during the worst of it) stylistically his voice is the type that will cause split opinions even when sung really well.  I don't mind that ultra high screech in my music. I did listen to a lot of thrash and hair metal growing up and there are plenty of vocalists similar to JLB but even more extreme (go listen to Nitro if you want something ridiculous). I think the guys in the band also listened to that kind of music so they probably liked that aspect of his singing when they hired him.  You could argue that what DT needed really was somebody with a solid backing baritone to compliment JLBs voice. I know Petrucci has a nice baritone but it's not very strong (though on the most recent tour it seemed like he'd been working on it and was pretty solid).
Dreamtheater,39exd0,knoerfw,2,Thu Jun 11 08:47:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it must be one of those ""it is your flavor or not"" type of things.  I just get the feeling quite often he tries to reach those super high vocals but he doesn't have the nicest sounding voice for it and it comes across like a kid yelling at the top of his voice with a very nasally overtone... Eh I guess I've just gotten so used to enjoying all the other excellent aspects to the band I take the good with the bad but sometimes I like to sing along and that is when I notice my annoyance heh."

Dreamtheater,39exd0,Mouse_Card,6,Thu Jun 11 12:45:39 2015 UTC,"Back in the Images and Words and Awake days, I thought he was a fantastic vocalist. He had this power and grit in his voice that just gave me chills. After his incident though, he was kinda hit or miss. Train of Thought and Systematic Chaos didn't work too well for him since his frail voice didn't match the brutality of the instrumentals. Afterwards, he controlled his voice and kept it more melodic and actually sounded pretty decent from Black Clouds and onwards."

Dreamtheater,39exd0,SceneFromaMemory_123,2,Thu Jun 11 13:17:11 2015 UTC,I used to think that way when I first started listening to some live performances.  But now I think that he is a great vocalist and that the songs would not be the same without him.

He has this really bad tendency to just of start doing this yell type thing where it doesn't fit and it doesn't sound very good. He's gotten better recently. He used to be better back in the day as well.  I don't like some of the overdubs he does, though that may be an issue with the producer and not him. There are too many songs where he'll be singing softly on one track, and in another be singing loud and all high pitch.  But yeah, without those complaints, I really like his voice and singing style. I think one of his best performances is on Voices."

Then he had his injury thing, kept singing anyway, fucked it all up, and basically was kinda shit until maybe mid-2000s...Like at the 20th anniversary show he absolutely fucking killed it.  I saw them 5 times between 2008 and 2013, and I thought JLB sounded fucking amazing on the BC&SL tour, but not so great on the ADTOE tour. I haven't seen them since then, because I was kind of over the whole go to a show every year thing, especially with the style James has adopted on ADTOE and DT12. Personally, I think that Portnoy had a positive effect on JLB's vocal capability and stylistic choices. Maybe JLB didn't like how Portnoy pushed him around, and I don't condone that kind of behavior either...but JLB's voice did sound better, I think. I mean, I feel like he reached his absolute peak of his ""modern days"" as I call them on BC&SL. Those high notes in Shattered Fortress? Fuck yeah.  Sorry, I rambled a bit :P"

But one must also keep in mind his age and the hectich touring and long set lists that DT perform. Considering that James has done pretty well as a singer. A guitarist can get a new guitar, but a vocalist can't . As seen in DVDs James takes great care of himself.  But over the course of these years James has become DT. I don't feel anyone can replace him now.   Albums like scenes show that you don't need crazy high pitched vocals to make a killer album. And to be fair , his live performance has greatly improved in the post Portnoy era."

To define certain Music as ""lacking"" is very relative, because everyone appreciates music in their own way. I know people who have setlists exclusively filled with 4 chord songs.   Furthermore I don't quite agree with your statement that music is devalued if it was not written by the same musician who performs it. Going forward with that logic we can assume that ACOS is a lackluster album as it mainly consists of covers.  As far as DT goes, I think they are doing quite well monetarily and in terms of the size of their fanbase."
Dreamtheater,39abtr,GrowlingM1ke,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:16:38 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you that me saying some music is lacking or bad is really just my thoughts coming out. I guess the reason i find other music lacking is because, as a guitatist, i find that pop music is much easier to play. And while that may not be bad ( there is simplier music i like) in my mind i like how complex and hard the guitar (and really all parts) part is. I completly understand that people have different reasons for liking different musics its just me who cant stand mordern day pop.  But on the subject i feel that playing music that you claim as you own while its not is lieing. I love bands who cover songs, they take what you like and add their own artistic style into it but they tell you that someone else wrote it. Its like if someone other than leonardo da vinci painted the mona lisa but leonardo claim to paint it. Everyone would praise him while whoever really painted it would be left  Whatever just me, screaming into the void"
Dreamtheater,39abtr,LukeWarm92,2,Wed Jun 10 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"Pop artists don't claim to write the music at all. The actual writer is always credited. Also, what about some of the greats like Frank Sinatra? He's only credited as a co-writer on a handful of songs yet I doubt you'd criticise him for it. Dream Theater are writers and performers, but there's nothing wrong with just being a performer."
Dreamtheater,39abtr,hard_baroquer,3,Wed Jun 10 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"I certainly used to feel that DT was as good as it gets.  I remember talking with a mate of mine a while back, when A Dramatic Turn of Events came out, that even though to me it was arguably their weakest album (its between that and Systematic Chaos. I feel like they're just churned out albums, made to meet a schedule of write and tour, write and tour, or fulfill a contract with Roadrunner, I dunno), it's still better than any metal album that had come out at the time (not that it was a bad year for music).   It's really about what the listener is accustomed to. Most people aren't musically inclined and just want something easy to listen to. To me they have sort of become the industry standard (if you like, they are my 'pop' band), and even if they're not the heaviest prog metal band out there, or not the fastest or most complex, they have perfected how to compose their songs. And as I've grown and slowly weaned away from metal, and gone for general musicality of an artist as opposed to Metal for the sake of Metal, Prog for the sake of Prog, I've realised that a well constructed Pop song is as good as (or even harder) to achieve than a 20-minute epic done for it's own sake. I've given up on guitar myself and I have no idea of how qualified you are as a musician, but with pop it's really all about getting that one excellent idea and working with it, of course most pop music is as churned out as can be, but so is most metal, and I now am aware that DT are not immune to that in my opinion.  A four chord song can be great IF composed well, and though it's metal as well, for what it's worth, Faith No More are the kingsof the well-constructed metal song. Although it is sad that the recognition goes to people who work hard at public perception as opposed to musical excellence, but then bands like Muse and RHCP are on top of the world and did it by being excellent musicians and songwriters, so the world is a little bit fair still."

I'll probably never appreciate the intricacies of high-level knitting, but like having mitts in the winter. It does exactly what I need it to do.   For some, DT is too much, too busy, too whatever... But when I think about Christina Aguilera, SOMEONE had to write her music. Pop music is harder to write than you might think. Look at the production value of music by Katy Perry - There's actually a LOT happening in her music.   At the end of the day though, you simply might not appreciate/value what she's offering, and that's perfectly okay. It's not that it lacks, it's that it's a different preference. That's why there are SO MANY styles of music.   There's no such thing as better or worse in art. Just... Preference."

There's a lot of good music out there, you can't get too angry about what is played on the radio.  In the last few years, I've still liked DT's new work, but it really doesn't compare to something like Haken's The Mountain or Tesseract's Altered States.   That being said, DT will always hold a special place in my heart. Awake, 6 degrees, Scenes from a Memory, Octivarium, and Images will always be some of my favorite music ever, not to take anything away from their other albums too. And also, in terms of sheer talent, DT was, and still is, up there as one of the most skilled bands, in terms of sheer talent, of all time. Each individual musician is in my top 5 on their respective instrument, both Portnoy and Mangini probably."

Dreamtheater,39abtr,naranha,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:52:11 2015 UTC,Since I started listening to DT 10 years ago I gradually stopped listening yo other pop and metal music. Today I only do it once in a while and find it always lacking something (which kind of sucks for me).  That said during this time I became a big fan of classical music and soundtracks. So that's what I listen to now while at work or relaxing.

I've seen a few ""knock offs"" of it for about £300 which aren't the proper set up he had. If you wanted the proper one, which isn't made anymore and haven't been since the early 90s you're looking for around £1,000.  Having played one a few years back I didn't like it overly much. The neck was a bit too fat for me. That and I kept accidentally knocking the pickup switch given its positioning.   His newer Music Man's though are OP."

For the first time since March of last year, I have no idea what I'm going to do next. Probably no full albums for a while, this one took a lot out of me.

Octavarium comes around, I can't wait, I buy it, Root of All Evil kicks ass & then... I just didn't really understand the rest. I thought it was weak.  But as I got to know DT over the years my mind opened to a lot more music than metal. Octavarium, the song, is one of my all times favorites. I'm still not crazy about the album. Besides the 2 songs I mentioned I only really like These Walls & rarely ever turn to the rest of them.  Still, that's what I love about the band. So many different sounds that a person's least favorite can be someone else's top favorite."

Dreamtheater,38rl6h,28Naufal,4,Sat Jun 6 16:25:52 2015 UTC,Hollow Years at Budokan or Razor's Edge.
Dreamtheater,38rl6h,Kenny_dies,3,Sat Jun 6 06:01:18 2015 UTC,"I wanted to say Breaking All Illusions, but since it has been named already, here is a very short but awesome groovy solo from the new album: Illumination Theory"

Honestly there are like 20 things I want to say equally hah. It's all just so damn good, the man's my hero.  For the sake of throwing something out there before I go to bed, I'll just go ahead and say the whole ending solo to Lie."
Dreamtheater,38rl6h,broncosrb26,2,Sat Jun 6 12:32:27 2015 UTC,Kindred Spirits was the first one that popped in my mind. Hollow Years Budokan and Lines in the Sand are also personal favorites.

Dreamtheater,38rl6h,mreichman,4,Sat Jun 6 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"Shattered Fortress is a good one, the second half specifically. Otherwise I have to go with Lines in the Sand or The Best of Times.."
Dreamtheater,38rl6h,Sha42,2,Sat Jun 6 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"Octavarium's Razor edge. Always gave me the chills.  The spirit Carries on.  And the mandatory Under a glass moon.  Also, Lines in the sand!"

Dreamtheater,3845rk,jumbon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:21:31 2015 UTC,Oh wow totally forgot about Scarred! Great song
Dreamtheater,3845rk,neutraliser1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:14:14 2015 UTC,"yeah This and Lines In The Sand  I have listened to DT loads through the last 6-7years with no break and favs gets substituted by other favs now and then depending on mood and relations to the songs.  However LITS, ACOS, TOT and Scarred seems to be untouched favourites. This might b the reason: LITS - Guitar Solo main reason for obvious reasons. The mysterious intro and feeling through the whole songs that remains a constant and not washed away by the fast prog that layers it. Very well executed song in terms of music/lyric and is always great to see live with all the various guitar solos that petrucci is delivering guaranteed to give you goosebumps.  ACOS - What to say on this. I was listening to DT from WDADU-DT(old-new) and after finishing awake i was so curious about this song cuz ive heard so much about it, and was told that you should follow up on the lyrics on the first listen. This combined with THC blew me away for 22 minutes, and the epic piece never seems to disappoint me.  ToT - much of what i wrote about LITS can be inserted here. This has been my traveling song, and loads of positive relations to it. I have also been lucky to see it live. Only downside with the solo is that it seems to be even too complex for even Petrucci to play live(from the last tour, i know he nailed it eariler), though that doesnt matter when the studioversion is flawless.  Scarred - Awakes Core. All those different musical emotions that this song goes through is really not to be explained. To me, Scarred is an epic that works as a compromise from awake to the other songs. That guitar solo too, makes me happy.  Sorry for long post, but some people(like myself) likes to see explanations to their opinions. Else just skip it :)"

Also, my phobia has bothered me less, people are easier to be around, and I am usually optimistic and happy where I used to be pessimistic and sad. I also used to have anger spells, where I would get really mad and hit/throw things, I have only had one in the last year (exactly how long I've listened to metal) compared to monthly ones. The only negatives are that whenever I hear pop music I have anxiety spikes, and when I hear country music I get really angry. I don't know why, but they do, especially stuff I used to listen to."

Dreamtheater,37v7m4,Alexmackzie,3,Sun Jun 7 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"I started out on Octavarium - it's a good choice and still my favourite.  I'm a fan of DT's post-2000 stuff which I think is a bit heavier, straighter and more guitar-based for the most part (especially Train of Thought) while pre-2000 is mostly more keyboardy and a bit lighter. I'd suggest OP try an album from each, maybe listen to Images and Words afterwards."
Dreamtheater,37v7m4,Ozelotten,17,Sat May 30 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"If you're a prog guy, start with Images and Words. If you like metal more, listen to Train of Thought or Systematic Chaos. Once you have listened to a couple albums, listen to Scenes from a Memory- the whole thing, start to finish. It is their best album but isn't as accessible- you may not like it right away but soon enough you'll realize its beauty."
Dreamtheater,37v7m4,clipperdylan6,3,Sat May 30 18:14:40 2015 UTC,"Given your tastes, I'd start with Six Degrees of Separation through the newer stuff, then go back to Images and Words through FII. Save SFAM (Metropolis 2000) until you are intimately familiar with the song Metropolis from I&W... the payoff is far more rewarding than if you listen to SFAM ""blind""."
Dreamtheater,37v7m4,energythief,7,Sat May 30 19:28:48 2015 UTC,Just a small correction for OP in case (s)he gets confused: the album is called Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.

Dreamtheater,37v7m4,energythief,3,Sun May 31 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"I started with images and words, maybe start there.  But their best album by far is scenes from a memory, and definitely one of the best representations of their talent and songwriting ability.  Check out a change of seasons and octavarium as well. Both are 20 minute songs, which again, represents everything good about the band."
Dreamtheater,37v7m4,freakingmagnets,3,Sun May 31 04:56:32 2015 UTC,"Being a fan since 91 when Images and Words came out, I would suggest just listening to them in order.   Sometimes songs on one album flash back to a song on a previous album.  That alone adds depth to later songs.  Some songs and albums you'll like more than others, but there's a lot to listen to and by listening in order, you can appreciate how the band has changed through the years as well."
Dreamtheater,37v7m4,MCEngraver,2,Sun May 31 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"Lots of different advice here! I only started with Dream Theater about a year ago and haven't quite got through the whole discography yet. I tried their greatest hits about two years ago and never got into it, so I don't recommend doing that.  A year later some users on Reddit were raving about 'Scenes From A Memory' so I figured I should give DT another go. 3-4 listens I was hooked. It was Dance of Eternity that got me in the end. So in regards to /u/clipperdylan6 said about its accessibility - it was accessible enough for me!"
Dreamtheater,37v7m4,joustah,2,Sat May 30 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. Dance of Eternity is an amazing song. However, Overture 1928 would be a bit more accessible compared to The Dance, since it's shorter, and, well, less confusing."
Dreamtheater,37v7m4,28Naufal,2,Sun May 31 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"Just start with Images &Words. This album was one of the lastest DT album, I've listened, and it changed my life!

I scoured Google and find the entire SFAM book.  Find the sheet music, transpose it for each part, and have fun.

Dreamtheater,37vhl3,rab7,2,Sun May 31 13:57:46 2015 UTC,The problem with pep band songs is that they have to be short. I'm currently working on Under a Glass Moon. It's pretty slow going though.

Dreamtheater,37ci73,JMAN365,2,Tue May 26 17:06:54 2015 UTC,It's like asking which God is the best.
Dreamtheater,37ci73,Scitron,7,Wed May 27 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"I'd also guess Jordan has the most talent. When you watch him and John playing one of their unison lines together (or any really fast section), John usually seems very concentrated and un-animated while Jordan smiles, looks and moves around, drinks coffee (Chaos in Motion DVD) and etcetera."
Dreamtheater,37ci73,meals6,6,Tue May 26 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"I'm also going with Rudess, but not because of how easy he makes it look (which he does)  As a keyboardist, you have a multitude of responsibilities beyond just playing notes, and getting a particular tone. You need to understand how effect chains work. You need to understand general studio configurations because keyboards like the Korg Kronos are NOT simple and are more or less their own studio in a box.   Take that a step further, then you need to understand synthesis and programming. Then if you're covering some songs, you need to be able to re-create certain sounds.   Jordan, beyond his ridiculous playing ability, also can program the fuck out of his keyboards. I've seen how he sets up his sounds from way back in the old days when he was with Kurzweil to now with the Korg Kronos and how it puts sounds together is just crazy.   Then yes, the dude can play like a madman. He can play and integrate various styles of music and can improvise in an immense way.   They're all amazing musicians, and I'm a huge Mike Mangini fan, but I'd have to say Jordan takes the ""talent"" cake on this one."
Dreamtheater,37ci73,enigmahack,2,Tue May 26 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say Portnoy, his time keeping and counting was one of the main inspirations for being able to jump to many different time signatures. What I like most though is his phrasing and fills. Listening to his work on the octavarium album especially on songs like these walls, where he can have pounding rhythms glide gracefully into cymbal focused ballets sends shivers down my spine."
Dreamtheater,37ci73,corsair2112,3,Wed May 27 02:14:54 2015 UTC,Portnoy's strength is his writing rather than is technical skills (which are impressive as it is). I've heard plenty of more talented drummers that write such dull parts. I've also heard more interesting drummers. Mike Mangini is probably a more technically skilled drummer but he also hasn't really gotten my attention in Dream Theater yet either.   I don't know what my point is. I guess that I disagree but but only half way. :)
Dreamtheater,37ci73,EYEONE84,2,Wed May 27 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'd go with JM on this one. I mean if you actually break down his bass lines it's pretty ridiculous yet it compliments the songs very well, (especially Under a Glass Moon's bass line during the guitar solo). He knows his instrument. But yeah, I see why people think Rudess is highly skilled."
Dreamtheater,37ci73,28Naufal,1 point,Wed May 27 02:31:23 2015 UTC,"Playing bass lines on a bass is harder than playing the same lines on a guitar. Frets are bigger, strings are harder, so you really have to press it down. Not to mention that JM has less string space cause he's playing on a 5 string neck (and it has 6 strings).  I recommend listening to isolated bass tracks of BC;SL (and others), on YouTube. You can hear in Count of Tuscany, after the second chorus (the instrumental section, before the guitar solo?), that he even goes beyond Petrucci, doing the normal bass octave (same playing as the guitar, but because it's a bass, it's an octave lower), then jumping immediately to a lower octave, and repeating (it's a very complicated riff, you can call it a trio between JM, JP, JR, though JR later does his thing in this same now duo).  But I think that everyone is equally talented. JP is.. well JP (listen to the solo of ITPoE pt 2), JR is a masterpiece, apparently can compose complex solos in an instant and can make good use of about anything you give him, piano effects related, MM, just give a listen to ADToE (I know he didn't compose that album, but he plays it), JLB (listen to his solo work and I want to hear you complain about his voice again, I dare you. Listen to the bonus songs at well. He's also the voice of DT. And he has sung numerous high pitched notes."
Dreamtheater,37ci73,neutraliser1,2,Wed May 27 04:07:49 2015 UTC,Jordan. Hands down. Juilliard when he was 10. Multi instrument talented. Did you guys know he also plays guitar? https://youtu.be/k-gcWMjotgE

The addition of Mangini gives them both a run for their money, too.  But what am I even talking about? Myung and Labrie are great, as well. The whole band is super talented, and it seems like every time they replace a member of the band, the technical talent increases significantly."

Dreamtheater,36zzgq,Dreamtallica,4,Sat May 23 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"The general community of non-prog rockers. An example is Freebird, a seven and a half minute song, which is generally considered epic."
Dreamtheater,36zzgq,the_boomr,5,Sat May 23 18:21:25 2015 UTC,This is a definition reserved only for DT. Because most of their catalog is 6-7 minutes.
Dreamtheater,36zzgq,Hamlet7768,3,Sat May 23 18:47:23 2015 UTC,"I just call them pieces. That's the technically correct terminology, since ""song"" is actually a particular form of music based in classical music forms. ""Piece"" is the proper generalized term for any work of music, whether it be a song, a symphony, a concerto, etc. :)"
Dreamtheater,36zzgq,the_boomr,2,Mon May 25 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"I call it an epic or a suite. Although in particular, for me, a suite should have noted sections, or at least distinct parts, a la A Change of Seasons, 2112, or Supper's Ready."
Dreamtheater,36zzgq,Terakonin,1 point,Sun May 24 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"Almost all of the longer songs have definitive movements. Octavarium has ""Someone Like Him"" and ""Intervals"" and others. Even Count of Tuscany has two major movements. So a suite would technically be correct."
Dreamtheater,36zzgq,Jmad916,3,Sun May 24 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"Just because a piece of music has movements doesn't make it a suite. The form of a suite is actually a lot more complicated: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite_(music)  Going by the most recent definition of the form, suites mainly involve taking chunks of music from a much larger work like a ballet, and putting them together. It is true however that before the symphony was invented, a suite was basically the standard form of music that involved multiple movements.  Of course, modern music, especially popular music, stretches all sorts of definitions all over the place."

Dreamtheater,36ry7f,Robo4900,2,Tue May 26 13:51:25 2015 UTC,"I believe Honor is the only straight up explicit one. S gets peppered in about once an album, especially with the 12SS. A little bit of H is heard here and there, but mostly on Awake. Really I am pleased at the general lack of profanity. Subject matter is also usually cleaner than anything I would hear on a pop radio. I can't think of any that promote unprescribed drug or alcohol use. The rare times they are mentioned are usually shown with devastating consequences. 12SS is about Portnoy's journey through alcoholics anonymous. Stream of Consciousness was renamed before release from Suck our Cocks. Live stuff can have them sprinkling profanity into what they say.   TL;DR some stuff is sprinkled in, but they are overall pretty clean compared to others."

Dreamtheater,36r4wl,SceneFromaMemory_123,3,Thu May 21 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"Just start with catchy ones. Dont rush with complex and obscure stuff too early. I suggest you Pull Me Under, Another Day, Surrounded, Wait for Sleep from Images and Words, The Spirit Carries On, Panic Attack, Forsaken, The Ministry of Lost Souls etc. Just stuff, Youtube usually suggest you, you know. If I remember correctly, I started with Wither (Oh god...).  For long songs and epics go with Metropolis part 1 first, then A Change of Seasons.  Btw: The Killing Hand from Live at the Marquee is pretty good too."
Dreamtheater,36r4wl,28Naufal,1 point,Thu May 21 20:26:21 2015 UTC,I'd say Octavarium rather than ACOS. Octavarium covers all of DT's styles.

Dreamtheater,36mgul,myfatherspad,12,Wed May 20 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"""By the grace of god above, everyone survived - GRRRRRRR!""  A Nightmare to Remember  I will never ever be able to take that seriously. Is it supposed to be taken seriously? I don't know. I don't know why they thought that was something good to add. I really wish I could see some of the production process on that.  ""Hey, how about I growl at the end of this verse about everyone being okay?""  Also, the overall lyrics were way way too straightforward. I understood that it was about a car accident right away. To me, that's the telltale sign of bad writing. Same with Count of Tuscany & Best of Times. Too straightforward, technically brilliant.  Which sucks. Because it's great on every other level. Great riff & I love the way the verses are sung. Just wish he was singing about something else."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,SiriusC,7,Wed May 20 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"Regarding the growling vocal part, that brief section went through a few changes before settling with what we got on the album.  According to Portnoy from Lifting Shadows:   I knew my vocals in Nightmare would surely spark some controversy and it looks like I was right. I felt the original melody that John Petrucci had to this section didn't work with the music. This section of the song has a really heavy, driving Judas Priest/King Diamond vibe musically and JP had a melody that was more melodic.  I felt James's high voice really softened up the music to this very important dramatic section of the song. I really kept hearing a Mikael Akerfeldt-type, Opeth death growl. The thought crossed my mind to ask Mikael himself to do it but then I figured I'd end up having to do it live every night on tour, so it might as well be me on the CD.  In the end, JP and I discussed it and he just couldn't hang with the cookie as he thought it was just too radical for DT fans to swallow. So I agreed to try adding James doing a bit of 'counterpoint' to my cookie monster version to possibly help soften the blow. But I didn't dig this approach as James's clean vocals were still softening up the music to me and the counterpoint approach made it all too confusing and distracted from the drive of the music.  So John and I went back to the idea of keeping my vocals for the section to keep it heavy and driving, but getting rid of the Opeth cookie monster approach and going for a more Robb Flyyn/Machine Head approach instead (kind of like my 'Constant Motion' voice and in the end, that is what we went with)."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,wangatangs,8,Wed May 20 19:44:40 2015 UTC,"""he just couldn't hang with the cookie""   Jesus...   Anyway, it sounds like Petrucci didn't like it but Portnoy was persistent. I understand the idea behind keeping it heavy, but there are other ways to accomplish that."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,SiriusC,2,Wed May 20 19:50:14 2015 UTC,They should've just had Mikael do it anyway.
Dreamtheater,36mgul,shibbypwn,1 point,Wed May 20 20:10:52 2015 UTC,I think they did for one night on the tour.  EDIT: They did.

Dreamtheater,36mgul,Maritimerintraining,1 point,Fri May 22 23:40:23 2015 UTC,I can see why. I personally prefer this version.
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Robo4900,2,Sun May 24 16:04:02 2015 UTC,"Something that enhances this story is when you have the audio clips of the three different versions that were done.  These can be heard along with Mike's personal comments on each version on his forums in this link.  As for what I think about the song and Mike's vocals... I like the song, and I think the cookie section works. Although, I much prefer it with James's counterpoint(Which I've edited into the song on the version of the song I listen to). I can definitely see where Mike was coming from with this, though. An ideal version of the song for me would be with the guy from Opeth doing the verse(Which he did do for one night on the tour) with James's counterpoint on top of it."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Robo4900,0,Fri May 22 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"Aw, such a shame that this always tends to be the top answer. I can see why many don't like it. Personally it's my favourite part of the song, and will listen to it even if I'm not in the mood for the rest.  I like it because it sounds (to me) more like an overworld perspective even though its the same person. And I like the way he sings it."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Snidernomore,-6,Fri May 22 02:38:52 2015 UTC,You clearly haven't listened to everything by DT if this is your least favourite song despite it being a subjective thing.

Ehh if its your least favourite song thats your loss, there is tons more shit from Falling into infinity thats pretty straightforward and actually quite cringy and mainstream in that it lacks substance.

Really should give it another go, the album is very different from DTs other stuff but it has this certain vibe and nostalgia to it. i overlooked it for quite sometime but damn when i got around to it after basically listening to all of DTs discography i realised i had been missing out ;)"

I was in my mid-20s when that album came out and was like...""WTF is this???"" 1st and last track are the only 2 I can deal with.   Another note, Most of the last 2 albums. Too...polished for me. I need balls and chunk. I as much as I like MM, I miss MP's cymbal play all the time. MM high speed rolls are sick, but not enough of the style I love."

Dreamtheater,36mgul,squidonthebass,3,Wed May 20 18:56:34 2015 UTC,No love from anyone for Lines in the Sand? I know it's a bit long for people but if you let yourself get into the groove of it it's such a fun song.
Dreamtheater,36mgul,ScawttyWotty,3,Wed May 20 22:49:01 2015 UTC,"I hate to be this guy, but I'd have to go with anything they play live where James goes off on some sort of ridiculous vocal tangent.    Either that or ""Build Me Up, Break Me Down"" -- I feel they've been trying too hard recently.  Their songs don't seem as organic as they used to in the past."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,hornywatermelon,11,Wed May 20 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"I've always skipped ""I walk beside you"". It just seems like an uninspired U2 sounding pop song to me. Although I don't mind the score version of it"
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Bocaj6487,7,Wed May 20 14:26:08 2015 UTC,I've got to throw shrapnel on this one. I Walk Beside You is one of my favorites. Great workout song as well. Also I listen to U2 and I don't get the comparison
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Mega_Exquire,1 point,Wed May 20 19:38:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm...if I may politely interject. What makes it a great workout song for you? I personally agree with /u/hornywatermelon (felt dirty writing this username, but I guess that's the point). I think the song is really boring, and I can't lift/run to it at all. Also, I'm a massive U2 fan, and I only kinda get the comparison...I guess the chord structure (and predictability) is similar to most U2 songs."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,hornywatermelon,0,Wed May 20 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"It reminds me of U2 because of Petruccis delay and the fact that it sounds to me that they wanted a pop rock song to play on the radio. Which is fine and I don't mind that, but it's not something I particularly enjoy listening to. I also think the lyrics are really cheesy"
Dreamtheater,36mgul,SuspiciousBulgarian,2,Thu May 21 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when it starts playing in my car on random I am like ""Yeah, that is nice"" and then the chorus starts."

Dreamtheater,36mgul,sonickarma,1 point,Thu May 21 00:04:23 2015 UTC,I much prefer the version on the Score concert to the album version. The tempo is slightly faster and it gives it a little more energy.
Dreamtheater,36mgul,spacedyed,3,Fri May 22 00:12:11 2015 UTC,"""The Spirit Carries On"" hides from flying shrapnel  I find it a little too hokey. I love SFaM as a record (musically much more than lyrically) and just don't find the moment as moving as I think I should."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,SiriusC,3,Wed May 20 14:39:18 2015 UTC,"I abhor the studio version, the Score version is amazing. And it's amazing live. But there's just something flat about the studio version."

Dreamtheater,36mgul,dudelikeshismusic,3,Wed May 20 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"I think it has an awesome change halfway through (Move on, be brave) and a fantastic guitar solo. But those lyrics...definitely the weakest part of SFAM."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Mega_Exquire,6,Thu May 21 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"::throws shrapnel::  Just kidding. I completely agree with you, honestly - It's just not an interesting song IMO. I've been to at least 15 DT concerts at this point, and each time, I seem to be seated near some jackoff that keeps chanting for them to play it. I just want to turn to them and say ""you know these guys wrote Glass Prison, right? That song is an option to chant for too"""
Dreamtheater,36mgul,spacedyed,1 point,Wed May 20 16:11:28 2015 UTC,Haha -- almost ANY other song is an option to chant!
Dreamtheater,36mgul,GamesinaBit,2,Wed May 20 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit bias because I have an emotional connection to the song, but I feel like it's one of their best. The change is so subtle, but that's just me personally."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,LegendaryStickMan,6,Sat Jul 11 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"I never really listen to the entire Falling Into Infinity album, but I give them a pass because that was kind of an off year for them.   However, I find myself skipping A Rite of Passage every single time it comes on. I just can't get into it. Even Prophets of War and Nightmare to Remember I'll give a listen every once in a while, but that one just bores me to tears."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,maximumhamburgers,-3,Wed May 20 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been skipping entire DT albums, namely Train of Thought, Systematic Chaos, and BC&SL. Those three albums just feel uninspired and rushed to me."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,dudelikeshismusic,5,Wed May 20 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, I think ToT is one of their stronger albums. The other two definitely lack cohesiveness, I was very happy when ADToE brought back the album flow I was used to."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,28Naufal,2,Thu May 21 00:07:01 2015 UTC,Easiest answer ever for me: Never Enough.  Far From Heaven is a close second.
Dreamtheater,36mgul,28Naufal,1 point,Wed May 20 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting first choice. I actually think Never Enough is one of the best tracks in Octavarium. Maybe because it sounds similar to muse, but hey it's only one's opinion."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,kakacha,1 point,Tue May 26 13:39:10 2015 UTC,"I've never been a Muse guy, so that may be what it is. It sounds like a carbon copy of Muse, and a less-well-done version (to me). I'm also very sensitive to the drum sound on albums, and Portnoy's ""John Bonham"" side set sounds absolutely horrible for DT's music (again, to me)."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,avantevanguard,1 point,Tue May 26 13:58:41 2015 UTC,"It does sound a lot like Stockholm Syndrome, and yes I do find the kit sounds a bit odd. Although, it never bothered me that much."

Dreamtheater,36mgul,Robo4900,2,Tue May 26 14:06:08 2015 UTC,Most ballad style songs by James Labrie; yes there are the exceptions (Vacant from TOT) but i listen to music more for the instrumentals the vocals are most of the time supplementary. That being said 8/11 songs from Falling into Infinity i rarely ever listen to and BCSL has a few from the first CD in addition Octavarium has a couple of songs im not to fond of.
Dreamtheater,36mgul,IncendiaryLemon88,2,Thu May 21 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"Four songs immediately popped into my head when I saw this.  1) Burning My Soul. God, that song is just terrible. 5:30 of just boring blandness.   So I hurt your feelings Well I'm really sorry But I don't give a shit... NOOOOOOO!   It's so cringe-inducing. FII is probably my least favorite album of theirs overall, even though I can usually listen through most of the songs on it without a problem. But Burning My Soul is just... bad.  2) Another least favorite of mine is... Space-Dye Vest.  hides  I get that it means a lot to many of the fans who were around when Kevin Moore was still in the band - but I came in around Train of Thought, and I just can't connect with that song on almost any level.  3) Never Enough. One of the only songs that's not on FII that I truly count as ""filler"". Nothing really memorable from it, an easily skippable song from an otherwise stellar album IMO.  4) And last but not least - The Best Of Times. Obviously, a very sentimental song about MP losing his dad. Don't get me wrong - the first half of the song is brilliant - the intro, first two verses and choruses are just pure gold.  But once ""But then came the call..."" rolls around, the song just loses what made it so great for me. I know it was a personal song for Mike, but it feels to me like it should have been a song that Mike released on his own, rather than putting it on a Dream Theater album.  holds breath and braces And I think the guitar solo at the end is overrated. It's definitely not bad, per se, but people act like it's one of his best solos, and I just can't put it there.  Anyways. Those are my least favorite DT songs off the top of my head."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Viter,1 point,Fri May 22 00:32:21 2015 UTC,"The Best of Times is one of JP's top 3 solos, imo. Only bested by the Breaking All Illusions solo.  But yeah, the lyrics in that song are super cringe-inducing. I don't have to have lyrics be super abstract or artsy, but I like it when they're a little less straight-forward than that. Ain't gonna be any internet debates over the meaning of THAT song..."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,squidonthebass,1 point,Tue May 26 14:09:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, Best of Times solo is definitely in my top 5 at least."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,jonnyballsthinkbox,2,Thu May 28 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"FII and WDADU are not objectively bad.  The production of WDADU was, but the songs themselves it's subjective. One thing I find is that people who don't like the album tend to not have heard much of it in a live form, which it holds up much better in.  Falling Into Infinity mostly suffers from a subpar track order. Skip the first two tracks(Or put them between Just Let Me Breathe and Anna Lee), and I find the album is excellent. :)"
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Zabunia,2,Fri May 22 02:27:30 2015 UTC,Hmmm. Tough one. I can't think of any genuinely bad ones off the top of my head but I don't really like Through Her Eyes. It's kind of just slow and meandering and doesn't do much for me. The only song I skip from Scenes.

Dreamtheater,36mgul,broncosrb26,1 point,Wed May 20 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's my list in no particular order:   You Not Me I Walk Beside You Through Her Eyes Forsaken Pretty much the entire self-titled. I tried listening to it once or twice and it seemed pretty forgettable overall to me.   On a side note, I'm kind of surprised about all the hate WDADU is getting. Sure, the production isn't the best and it's doesn't have JLB, but I still think the songs on there are great. Killing Hand is probably one of my favorite DT songs. Obviously, Ytse Jam is a shoo-in in terms of ""classic"" DT. The rest of the songs are pretty solid as well. I will admit I like those same songs better live with James on vocals, performed in the early 90s era, than I do on the album. Charlie isn't a bad singer though by any means. Just seems like most DT fans don't care for his style."
Dreamtheater,36mgul,Metalmonkey666,1 point,Fri May 22 04:06:35 2015 UTC,"The Answer Lies Within, probably. Beautiful feel to the song, but the lyrics are so generic and painfully simple/redundant they could have been written by a fifth grader."

Because his lives are amazing atm, believer it or don't. I always liked his studio-voice, but I only started to love his Live-voice after the ADTOE-tour.

Dreamtheater,35sf5l,HighKiteStylist,5,Wed May 13 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"Octavarium was the first song I ever listened to by Dream Theater. My young mind was absolutely blown. Then I moved onto the album, and this song rose to being one of my favorites. Just a great album all around."
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,Iamametameta,16,Wed May 13 07:49:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like the entirety of the Octavarium is grossly underrated. For me it's the album that kickstarted by love for Dream Theater. Never Enough and Root of all Evil are fairly kickass too. I wouldn't say it's different from other albums like some do, just maybe a bit more overly refined and pointed to a wider audience than other albums."
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,ClicheHuman,3,Wed May 13 13:43:53 2015 UTC,"I think Octavarium showcases the vast number of styles the band can achieve in one album. Panic Attack and Root of all Evil for the heavier crowds, The Answer Lies Within and I Walk Besides You for the more shorter songs and Sacrificed Sons and the title track for the epic tunes. Never Enough and These Walls is somewhere in the between."
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,wangatangs,4,Wed May 13 18:22:12 2015 UTC,Love this song. It convinced me to buy a baritone.
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,Oliver_5150,-2,Wed May 13 13:24:52 2015 UTC,Did not see that coming.
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,Snidernomore,3,Wed May 13 16:53:25 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,enndeee,3,Wed May 13 03:26:41 2015 UTC,The Luna Park version is really really good too.
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,IThoughtThisWasDigg,2,Wed May 13 20:10:49 2015 UTC,This is my gateway song for people who've never heard them before.  As soon as everything kicks in at the beginning--it's all over.  You're done.  You're a fan of this band.
Dreamtheater,35sf5l,ScawttyWotty,2,Wed May 13 16:18:49 2015 UTC,Wow I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't like this song.

Dreamtheater,35sf5l,PHPH,2,Wed May 13 21:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yea there's nothing wrong with that. It just doesn't do anything for me. Mostly because I'm more of a fan of their heavier songs, like panic attack I guess."

Even as a critic of some of their newer stuff, I listened to this one a lot when octavarium came out. Solid track."

Dreamtheater,35mcq6,cth1ic_warrior,1 point,Tue May 12 04:12:38 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the majesty is more expensive than the john Petrucci model?
Dreamtheater,35mcq6,velociwaffle719,1 point,Tue May 12 14:26:29 2015 UTC,"Nah, they are actually around the same price a JP 15 is around $2999 but a majesty I believe is at $2900 on sweetwater. If you look though, since they've been out for a while, you can find majesty's used for a good price."
Dreamtheater,35mcq6,cth1ic_warrior,2,Tue May 12 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"I live in Canada, so that is around 4000 unfortunately.   I wonder how the majesty is different from the jp15? (Or did I already ask this)"

Dreamtheater,35e98x,CaiBelenos,2,Sat May 9 14:18:20 2015 UTC,I'd have to hear it before I judge whether or not I'd want him to use it.  He adopted the 7 string pretty early on and he's one of the best with it now.  I don't see why he can't be inventive with the 8 string as well.

Dreamtheater,357w2o,jesusoxer15,7,Thu May 7 21:05:07 2015 UTC,"I never really noticed how much delay there is in this. For the most part, I dont really enjoy isolated solos, just because it sounds kinda empty with out all the instruments, but this wasnt like that all. The delay really helps fill out the track, and at times almost sounds like backing music."
Dreamtheater,357w2o,drrd777,3,Fri May 8 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"There's actually a lot of semi-recent DT songs with this effect. The guitar solo in On The Backs of Angels comes to mind, where it actually is hugely distracting to me when I listen to it, always focusing on the 0.5 second delay on every, single, fucking, note, in the solo."
Dreamtheater,357w2o,IThoughtThisWasDigg,2,Mon May 11 18:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, listening to On the Backs of Angels again, i have to agree that the backing music in The Best of Times does a much better job of masking it and filling out the whole track, whereas the delay is much more noticeable in OtBoA."
Dreamtheater,357w2o,drrd777,3,Mon May 11 18:58:40 2015 UTC,I think John reached the height of his tone on Black Clouds. Still amazes me to this day how great his sounds were on that album.

Dreamtheater,357w2o,ledki,2,Thu May 7 23:28:04 2015 UTC,So much technique and specificity in every single note. I love everything about this.
Dreamtheater,357w2o,SHD_lotion,3,Fri May 8 22:51:27 2015 UTC,Without the context the sudden shredding sounds like he has tourette syndrome. Otherwise a beautiful guitar sound (as always).

I can't wait to see them live once again. James amazed me with how accurate his singing was during the Along For The Ride Tour, especially how the 2013 Christmas album made me think he would be only decent."

Dreamtheater,34sqvl,spacedyed,6,Mon May 4 10:42:56 2015 UTC,maybe have done with fewer opening acts.   That was always the problem with Jaxx/Empire -- rarely saw a show there where the headliner came on before 11pm. That kept me away from most shows there - including this one.

Dreamtheater,34sqvl,Zodimized,1 point,Mon May 4 21:48:13 2015 UTC,I suppose it's subjective. I don't go for most female metal vocalists either but thought hers has a lot of power behind it and sounded awesome. The studio recordings on their site are even better.

I would love to see him play it live, but I have a feeling this will be a song they probably won't play unless they have a reunion show with Mike Portnoy, but seeing as they played Space-Dye Vest after all those years i guess its not out of the question."

Dreamtheater,34epw8,drrd777,4,Thu Apr 30 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think he said it was too emotional of a song, and he didn't think he'd be able to make it through without getting too worked up, which is understandable. Whats really crazy to me is that they wrote and recorded the whole instrumental, and it ended up fitting perfectly for the lyrics and subject matter Mike Portnoy had in mind."

I didn't enjoy DT12 a whole lot, but I loved ADToE, and one of the differences is that with DT12 they said they were recording everything they played, and they ended up using a bunch of that material that they thought was really great the moment they came up with it, whereas for ADToE, they had written all the melodies and structures ahead of time.  Just my personal opinion, but I tend to like the music DT produces a lot more when they Take the Time in the writing process to really fully construct their music and complete each song before actually recording."

They were in the demo version but cut for the studio recording of FII.  There were some brutal shows on that tour. Three-hour shows with three albums worth of material."

I actually really hate this kind of things, the kids may be good, I don't know since I haven't heard anything yet so I'll leave that judgment to after the album comes out, but even if they suck balls they'll get the attention they don't deserve just because of Mike.  If they are good they should have just hid the fact that Mike is producing the album, and at least try not to use the Portnoy name as a lure."

Truth is, MP doesn't have enough time to get more involved on Max's drumming, since he is always on the road touring with his multiple bands.   I know the kids personally. Thomas, the singer and keyboardist is actually behind pretty much all of the writing, him and Ryland the guitarist are super talented and gifted musicians... During their second show at the PNAS Cruise, I was talking to them and suddenly, Tony MacAlpine came over to congratulate and praise Ryland's playing... Tony fucking MacAlpine!"

That aggression was well-used on Awake, but here he's just like trying to burst his balls on stage 100% of the time, and it's kinda off-putting, because the vocal melodies in this song are quite beautiful, and he's just blasting his vocal chords to death."

Dreamtheater,32rhv1,mrjuliobob,18,Thu Apr 16 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"LTE was originally intended to be completely separate from DT.  Portnoy ended up asking Petrucci to play guitar because he couldn't find anyone else who was a good fit (I think he had previously asked Dimebag Darrell and Jim Matheos and neither worked out).

Dreamtheater,32rhv1,NBGaines,6,Thu Apr 16 04:24:48 2015 UTC,"In the DT biography book Lifting Shadows it is said that the formation of LTE had some obstacles. Magna Carta Records asked Portnoy to form a superband, and he liked the idea. Originally Billy Sheehan was the bassist and Jens Johansson the keyboardist of the band. Nobody of the approximately 20 guitarists (if I remember correctly Brian May was one of them too) Portnoy contacted couldn't join though and Sheehan, Johansson and Portnoy all ran out of time because of their main bands. Next time Portnoy had time to try forming the band again Sheehan and Johansson wasn't available, so Rudess and Levin (both asked for the band last time already) got the part. He couldn't find a guitarist this time either, so finally he decided to ask Petrucci even though Mike planned to keep this project separated from DT."

Dreamtheater,32qpdc,gimme3steps101,2,Wed Apr 15 23:09:12 2015 UTC,"Apparently, the sax part was recorded in studio and inserted into the song essentially as an overdub. I think that's why The Lost Paris Tapes includes the song; it's slightly ""More live"" than the official CD.  And as for the Rotterdam show, although the song was performed on that night, and they did have a saxophonist, he was a Dutch guy called Hubert Young. For future reference, Once In A LIVEtime only includes material from that one night in Paris, though(Thus the ""Once"" part of the name). 5 Years was a compilation, and the Once In A LIVEtime Outtakes was essentially a compilation of songs that didn't make it to either release from the Rotterdam and Paris shows."

The first disc of the album is very experimental and weird, but the second disc(Containing the 42-minute title track) has a very Scenes From A Memory-like sound. Once you're done with that, try Images And Words, then Awake, then chronologically from Train Of Thought onwards, then go back for Falling Into Infinity and When Dream And Day Unite.

I don't necessarily see people hate on SoC, but never really much love for it either....this song kinda just puts me in a trance, and the whole structure of the thing is just brilliant, the song basically comes full circle at the end, and there's a moment right at the end where they repeat that same odd-time rhythm that keeps coming back throughout the song, but on the last repeat of the rhythm, they add a beat to make it in normal 6/8, and it's like BAM, Stream of Consciousness has completed itself!!

It sounds like you said ""if you turn your brain off, then the song's a masterpiece"".  Could you maybe counter some of what I said? Give a different perspective on it, on why you think it's so amazing? That's more of what I was hoping for when I posted the topic. It will persuade me more to give the song more credit than a ""turn your brain off""."
Dreamtheater,32henk,GoldenGraham86,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:17:41 2015 UTC,You're right in a sense. I just don't think it's necessary to pick apart every aspect of a song to determine its worth. Sometime people do need to turn their brains off to enjoy things. We tend to over-analyze everything these days. I don't think there's anything I can say to persuade you. Just listen...don't analyze.
Dreamtheater,32henk,2_Wycked,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"Same here. 8varium is Mike Portnoy's ultimate namedrop/reference fest and the whole ""full circle/ 8 & 5"" concept throughout the album has an incredible payoff here, plus the distinct sections have some of DT's best songwriting and lyrics ever."
Dreamtheater,32henk,IncendiaryLemon88,6,Wed Apr 15 01:27:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I love the song but I do agree it could have benefited from 2 or 3 minutes being cut out of the intro. I tend to agree with /u/GoldenGraham86, I don't like over thinking music. I'm not even sure I completely understand what you're getting at in your post, to me, intro aside, the song is a masterpiece. I'd definitely put it in my top 5 DT songs."
Dreamtheater,32henk,TanglyMango,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"What I'm getting at is basically this: the first section seems to be about someone who wanted to avoid repeating the mistakes of a man they knew, but failed, causing them to live in constant stagnation. Then it shifts to the second section, and the song suddenly becomes about someone waking up from a coma. It's such a weird, jarring shift, and the two stories are never sufficiently linked together."
Dreamtheater,32henk,ZessF,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:24:08 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason the intro is so long, and other sections, I guess, is to make the song 24 minutes long, citing 24 hours in a day, another cycle."
Dreamtheater,32henk,Snidernomore,5,Sat May 16 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"I've never been crazy about it. Didn't think it was anything special until I started reading this sub so I tried it a few more times. I prefer any of their other longer ""epics"" over Octavatium. Can't put my finger on exactly what I like and dislike about it though."
Dreamtheater,32henk,HighKiteStylist,4,Mon Apr 13 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when you hear an opinion of something before a song, it can effect your own perspective. If you had hears how highly many regard Octavarium, and you think it's mediocre, you'll dislike it even more.  Personally I do believe it's their best song, it amazes me when I listen to it. It is complex, the instrumentals are geat and don't bore me, I love that the start moves slowly, and the last two parts are perfect.  But if you don't like it, that's okay. It's not unified no, but that's okay with me."

Dreamtheater,32henk,noahlauzier,3,Tue Apr 14 00:41:49 2015 UTC,Medicate is hands down the best part of the track for me.  Full circle is really weird to me a lot of the time. They redeem it some with Razors edge after the mess of Full circle.   Have you ever read that wiki out there with the full octavarium analysis?

One day, I want to be able to play Breaking All Illusions or Dance of Eternity.... or any other of their solos..."

Dreamtheater,31uerg,Metalmonkey666,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:06:55 2015 UTC,Guitarist. I'm re-learning oververture 1928 after a guitar free spell due to a crazy work schedule. I'd love to learn the Glass prison but I don't have a 7-string. I am also off and on learning a nightmare to remember and a fortune in lies.  But im actually focusing on some porcupine tree tunes at the moment more than anything. Normal and trains. Great on acoustic guitar.
Dreamtheater,31uerg,TheCurse74,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:42:57 2015 UTC,Seven strings are awesome. I recommend getting one. Overture 1928 is dope.

Scenes From A Memory is still my favorite album of all time and I'd like them to kind of slow it down a bit, and be a bit more proggy this time around.   I've been listening to a lot of Animals As Leaders, Pomegranate Tiger and Scale The Summit as of late and would LOVE to hear the fellas push both the music and lyrics way outside of their comfort zone. Seeing as how they can play damn near anything under the sun, that would be quite a zone they'd have to be in.   I kind of look at Dream Theater as a real life Dethklok in terms of fan base dedication and support. I want this album to be so good it causes a global revolution."

I know the band had tensions over Portnoy's drinking before he left, and I know that he really enjoyed being on the road at Gigantour, which influenced his decision to roll with Avenged Sevenfold.  Once you play for years and years in such a tight group, saying you want to play with another band or go on a break can be taken as a huge insult.  Whatever they talked about is never going to go public but it must have been a massive fight for this to happen.  Those kinds of things don't happen overnight either.. it had to be building for years.  I'm still hoping someday the band and Portnoy come together again in some fashion.  The rest of DT felt betrayed, and that'll never go away, but time will heal the wounds of pride.  Someday Mangini and Portnoy will share a stage, I am sure of it."

It's just that portnoy was such an important part of their sound, and while I'm sure the music is still great, I've heard it's kind of lost the soul, which was apparent in even black clouds."
Dreamtheater,30rli7,Mapex_proM,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:27:56 2015 UTC,Portnoy drummed that album.
Dreamtheater,30rli7,noahlauzier,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:47:58 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, all the drums on ADToE were written by JP, with MM adding in just a little bit of his own flair on the final recordings.  Honestly though, with as much flack as Mangini has got, IMO he has done a fantastic job considering the massive shoes he had to fill."
Dreamtheater,30rli7,drrd777,4,Mon Mar 30 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"I learned about the band soon after DT12 was released, I was looking for songs related to the phrase 'I am.' It was a hell of a starting song, but honestly, I don't think I would have fallen in love with DT if I heard Pull Me Under or Dance of Eternity first. I never could figure out the chronological order of the albums until I learned about 12SS, so I never knew what was and wasn't Portnoy.   When I found out he left I was furious and boycotted Mangini, until I found out that he was the second fastest drummer in the world. I eased up a bit. Then I heard On The Backs Of Angels again on Pandora. (It had been the second DT song I had ever heard, and I had once loved it.)  This opened my eyes to realize that it is still DT, it's still JP behind the guitar, Myung behind the bass, LaBrie behind the mic, just a different drummer with a different personality.  I then thought about the pianists/keyboardists. Each of them brought something different and exciting to DT. One brought insane skill and precision to the playing. One brought extra energy to performances. And one brought an extra layer of depth to his lyrics.  I finally realised that this could be good, and might produce some interesting directions for the band."
Dreamtheater,30rli7,90guys,3,Mon Mar 30 04:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a great way of looking at it! They're always going to be compared, but in the end they're different drummers who bring different things to the table."

Dreamtheater,30rli7,philliplennon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:34:24 2015 UTC,"(1997) Falling Into Infinity is also really good. Lines In The Sand and Trial Of Tears are on it, and they are both epic.  But yeah, Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence might be a better choice. It's a double CD, so more musical content, and definitely some classics on it. You can't really go wrong with any of them though. Same goes for Awake and to a lesser extent A Dramatic Turn Of Events. I would wait with the eponymous album Dream Theater until you have all others. It is still a great album and definitely better than anything most bands can produce, but it is also a bit different from the rest.  Each of the later albums still has one or more big epic tracks, which are really great. Breaking All Illusions (2011) and Illumination Theory (2013) are still amazing, even though there's no Portnoy."
Dreamtheater,30ri2a,noahlauzier,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:15:07 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I saw Mike doing the same to Jordan Rudess for his birthday in 2002. Then Jordan took Petrucci's guitar and made a guitar solo. That was probably usual for them. Or Jordan is funnier than Labrie.

Dreamtheater,30fng0,DoubleChicken,7,Fri Mar 27 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"I don't mean it in a bad way! Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who realizes how fucking awesome DT's recent albums are... With maybe the exception of SC and BCASL (not that they're bad, just not exactly up to par) but I definitely think ADTOE is so underrated."

Dreamtheater,30fng0,dudelikeshismusic,5,Fri Mar 27 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"Systematic Chaos was really good, though. In the Presence of Enemies is amazing, THE best DT epic IMO."
Dreamtheater,30fng0,wangatangs,9,Sat Mar 28 10:33:39 2015 UTC,"The s/t was a great album. Don't get me wrong. But it's not a good sample of DT's sound. The drum sound quality is bad, the choruses get pretty samey, and Enigma Machine is not their finest instrumental by any means.   Dream Theater has been through a few different eras and style changes. I mean, this makes sense considering they've been a band for almost 30 years. The first album is very proggy but fairly immature. IaW and Awake are considered some of their best prog metal, though IaW is a more consistent album. FII is the low point due to the attempt at commercial appeal, though it still has some awesome songs. SFAM started a stylistic shift that caused SDoIT and ToT to follow: awesome prog metal with a fresh sound. ToT is the heaviest by far. Octavarium is a similar style but way softer. It is the most Muse-esque of their albums. Systematic Chaos is probably the most experimental DT album; it has some great stuff and some weird stuff. BC&SL was kind of a mix of the old and new. It almost felt like a sampling of each DT style. ADTOE is similar in structure to IaW, but with the sound of s/t. Honestly, I like each album for its own reasons, but I come back to SFAM and ToT the most.  Also, check out their live albums! Once in a LIVEtime, Budokan, and Score are generally the favorites, but I enjoyed all of their live material. Once in a LIVEtime is an excellent sampling of their early sound, and Score and Budokan really catch their mid 2000's vibe."
Dreamtheater,30fng0,jeauxoxo,7,Fri Mar 27 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"I believe the band's ""best"" trilogy of albums are Scenes from a Memory, Six Degrees and Train of Thought. For Scenes from a Memory, many fans consider that particular album to be the band's best. It's a concept album and many songs flow into each other. It may be daunting to listen to the whole album in one continuous go but the album is excellent and showcased the band's highest achievement and best abilities.  The band's self-titled 2013 album had songs that were around the five to seven minute range besides Illumination Theory. Those song lengths were somewhat atypical for the band since many of the songs from the band's post-2000 period were much longer. I feel Scenes from a Memory (besides the three obvious epic tracks) had similar song lengths like their self-titled 2013 album too.  From Scenes, I'd recommend Overture 1928, which goes right into Strange Deja Vu. Then Through My Words, which goes into Fatal Tragedy. The Dance of Eternity is one of the band's finest instrumentals and I think The Spirit Carries On is one of the band's finest ballads. The three epic tracks, Beyond This Life, Home and Finally Free are pretty gnarly too if you like longer tracks.  Six Degrees is a double album and showcased a vast number of different styles the band can achieve on one (or two) albums. Like The Glass Prison is insanely over-the-top and heavy; Blind Faith is a bit more melodic and riff-centric while Disappear is (I think) a fantastic ballad and has tons of emotion. The Great Debate has great atmospherics and has a lot of builds and dynamics.  The second disc for Six Degrees is basically one massive 42+ minute track but broken up into eight tracks on the CD. Again, it's a somewhat concept album and many of the tracks showcase different styles for the band. So if you like a particular song from Six Degrees, there are other albums that can showcase that style you like.  Lastly, Train of Thought is a straight up, heavy, heavy album. A lot of riffs are over-the-top. Some fans were turned off by how heavy this album was but this album was the first one I heard by the band. While there are only seven songs on the album, many of them are epics and have a diverse musical landscape."
Dreamtheater,30fng0,neutraliser1,8,Fri Mar 27 03:47:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting choice for a trilogy! I've never really thought of representing a band's music in that way.  If I had to name three, I'd say I&W, Awake and Scenes.  I can't see how you can recommend DT without naming Images and Words, which, I'd argue, is the album that created progressive metal.   Awake essentially does what for Train of Thought did for your set - it's heavy and represents a darker, but still quintessential, side of the band's work.  Scenes speaks for itself - pretty comfortably the greatest prog metal concept album ever written, and their definitive work."
Dreamtheater,30fng0,YoshiYogurt,2,Fri Mar 27 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"There's two types of people here: the heavy prog fans (Train of Thought, Glass Prison, Enemy Inside) and 'proggy' prog fans (Images and Words, SFAM). Personally, I like both, but I lean more towards the heavier side. There's no album better than other (each is unique), so try to take in consideration other people's opinions.  I, for one, don't really like I&W as much as ToT or Systematic Chaos."
Dreamtheater,30fng0,Penngrove,4,Sat Mar 28 10:41:20 2015 UTC,"Your love for DT very closely mirrors mine. People talk about I&W being their penultimate album, but for me it pales in comparison to both SFAM and 6DOIT (though I still love it!).  TOT was also the first album of theirs I listened to closely, and the heaviness hooked me...but I've since grown to like several of their other albums more."

Dreamtheater,30fng0,TwelveStepSuite,3,Fri Mar 27 04:18:36 2015 UTC,"you can definitely hear the Rush influence. But its only for certain parts.  Musically it's great. The drumming is insane and the bass and guitar is all over the place but in a good way. I like the keyboards, adds a lot of depth.  It's over 20 minutes long but I didn't feel bored at all.  The lyrics can be alittle cliché at times but they get the job done.   I think this is a pretty good description of them overall, so perhaps that somewhat speaks to the self-titled as an overall representation heh.

I've been a fan since 1999 and except systematic and black clouds, I really love all of their phases and always find something to listen or learn on guitar on every album.  My most jaw dropped moments were scenes, six degrees, liquid tension 1&2, then old albums, then octavarium and the two latest albums :D"

I've often wondered what it would be like to become a fan now and have access to the complete library of music. As someone who has been listening since I was 17, i've had so much time to digest each album, about 2 years for each album before the next is released. I can't imagine trying to absorb all that music at once.   That being said, my personal favorites are Images and Words, Awake, Scenes From A Memory, and Train of Thought."
Dreamtheater,30ad7h,rd1994,5,Wed Mar 25 19:41:23 2015 UTC,Most of the CD inserts from the older albums show the parts. I beleive even Breaking the Fourth Wall/DT2013 has the parts titled.
Dreamtheater,30ad7h,Conspiracy795,3,Wed Mar 25 20:21:21 2015 UTC,yeah they do list the parts but not with individual lengths..I don't have any DT album on hand to specify but its mostly that the track (if its not split like SDOIT) say 15 minutes long and then lists the parts (without any lengths) in the booklet..but wikipedia lists times for those parts...and I wondered if those where correct
Dreamtheater,30ad7h,seeegma,2,Wed Mar 25 21:38:45 2015 UTC,I'm very confident it is just approximation done by a fan. If it's not in the booklet I don't know where else it would be.

Dreamtheater,2z6870,Snidernomore,3,Mon Mar 16 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fully getting into them was a several month process for me, really. Started with somebody I know getting me into a few songs (Panic Attack on Rock Band helped too). Eventually after a summer of listening to that small handful, I was like hmm, let's see what's up with these guys. Checked out ToT (I don't remember if this is the first thing I came across when I searched, or if it was because of As I Am which was one of the first couple songs I knew originally).   Anyway, I thought ToT was okay, there were a few cool moments, sure. Alright. Well I guess it was good enough that I decided to give it another run through later. And then another. After giving the album a few full listens, I started to really absorb all the dimensions to the music, and by the end I was in love.  Then I repeated that process album by album. Each time it took a few full listens to really fully appreciate it. Had to soak up everything the band was about, all the cohesiveness of what they do. Nowadays everything about them is far and away my absolute favorite, but I didn't get there overnight. I don't know if I would have been sufficiently intrigued if I'd just been flicking through channels on satellite radio and happened upon one random song of theirs.  And man, I miss that discovery phase with them. Slowly realizing how fantastic they are, and having this huge wealth of new (to me) material I could dive into."
Dreamtheater,2z6870,TwelveStepSuite,3,Mon Mar 16 06:30:15 2015 UTC,"It has taken me over two years.  First it was Panic Attack. Then Octavarium. I tried with the rest, and it was so difficult. Then I got into a Nightmare to Remember.  It took me a year to get into three songs. When you say ""Slowly realizing how fantastic they are, and having this huge wealth of new (to me) material I could dive into."" this is exactly it. I still haven't got into every album, and am working on Falling into Infinity and Octavarium now. My most recent, Images and Words, took a good 10 listens before it sunk in.  And there is just so much material. I'm not going to get bored for a long time, if ever."

They wanted to have a big tour for WDaDU but their label put essentially no effort into marketing the album, and none of the singles caught on with the radio, so very little happened as a result of that. With Images and Words, while initially it wasnt going to be that big of an affair, Pull Me Under changed everything. Their name got out and they started to sell out shows, and IIRC they upgraded from all being packed in the back of a van to nice tour buses.   Source: My shoddy-at-best memory of Lifting Shadows, if any of that is wrong totally call me on it, i dont have my copy on me   As for openers, Lifting Shadows (Their biography) discusses all of their tours up to the BCaSL tour, and they mention openers for all the tours that werent done as ""An Evening With,"" as well as discussing the early years when they were the openers and tours later on in their career such as the tour with Queensryche, Gigantour and Prog Nation where they were involved with other big name bands."

ToT was the first full album I really got into of theirs and I tend to be a ""dark-sider"" and it's one of my favorites, so a show focused around that with other great choices to round it out is wonderful.  And the performance I think is one of the better ones. I mean the band is always solid but I can't fault anything any of them do there even including JLB. I think it's the first show where I really don't notice the food poisoning in him and I think he comes back pretty strong. Just a well-rounded show in every single way IMO and it comes with all the aforementioned live-only extra goodies too.   Generally speaking: hnnnnggggg!"
Dreamtheater,2yh042,Anticitizen_01,11,Tue Mar 10 07:33:57 2015 UTC,"Score. It spans all their albums from WDADU-Octavarium.

Dreamtheater,2yh042,jeauxoxo,4,Mon Mar 9 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"Score gets my vote as well. The mix is perfection, each member is really on their game, and it has a really good spread of their material. Raise The Knife, I would agree, is definitely a highlight, but don't forget Another Won. I would never have thought that old-school, pre-Dominici power-metal style DT would translate so well to their lineup and style at that time."

Dreamtheater,2yh042,Anticitizen_01,2,Tue Mar 10 02:20:15 2015 UTC,"Is ToT the cutoff? I sorta got the impression a lot of people don't like Systematic Chaos and beyond, but I didn't think there were a lot of Octavarium-dislikers around here. I could be wrong though.  But yeah I personally think there's a pretty consistent spread of good stuff throughout the whole discography. Perhaps some albums speak to me more than others at different times depending on my musical mood, but in general there's a lot to offer from all of them imo."
Dreamtheater,2yh042,PHPH,2,Tue Mar 10 08:01:51 2015 UTC,"ToT would seem to be the cutoff. But to be honest, I'm not really much of a fan of ToT or SC. Both albums do have some good songs, but they are much heavier than any of their previous work. I really like BC&SL and think its very underrated.

Dream Theater songs are hard on everything, which was great for when Harmonix wanted some super hard songs in Rock Band 2, but otherwise it turns off a lot of casual players (even if they like the band), and is really only appreciated by more hardcore players, who are in the minority.   It also takes much more time for the people who create the note charts to accurately tab out a Petrucci solo or Portnoy/Mangini fills than a simple 4/4 rock song. Adding to all of that, Dream Theater's still relatively obscure. I'd be surprised if we don't see at least one more song, but they're not the type of band that's going to get anything like a full album in the game."
Dreamtheater,2yev3q,mrjuliobob,2,Mon Mar 9 05:51:35 2015 UTC,"Well, in that case, if they were to just give us A Change of Seasons, I'd be happy. Rush's 2112 is already available as DLC, so I can see it as a possibility."

These are the songs I look to for a more uplifting feeling (although some parts are more of a soft prog rock, like The Looking Glass's chorus).  Now, if you're just starting out in DT, listen to these albums as I list them (when you're out for both metal and softer tones):   Images and Words (the classic DT album; every song on here is uniquely Dream Theater)   Sometime before going to ""Six Degrees,"" listen to ""A Change of Seasons.""  While the covers are cool and all, the title track is really all you need to listen to for now.   Metropolis, Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory (My personal favorite, reminiscent of DT's classic prog metal sound meshed with classic prog rock ideas) Awake (easily their darkest album in terms of lyrical content) Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (a lengthy double album featuring the titular 42 minute epic and Mike's first entry about his journey through, AA, ""The Glass Prison""). Train of Thought (their heaviest album to date) Octavarium (quasi-concept album, culminating in their titular 24 minute epic, spanning dozens of rock, metal, and prog influences and allusions) Systematic Chaos (their second heaviest album; alternatively called ""Best DT Riffs 2007"") Black Clouds & Silver Linings (5 really long songs, and ""Wither.""  Not their best album, but try not to cry during ""The Best of Times."") Self Titled (their most recent effort, also very musically eclectic like Octavarium.  I didn't like this one much at first; however, it grew on me and it's easily one of their best) A Dramatic Turn of Events (I loved this album, but some DT fans didn't like it because it was just more of the same shit.  It reminded me a lot of I&W, but with a more metal sound). Falling into Infinity (the somewhat-of-a-catastrophe that gives us ""Trial of Tears,"" ""Lines in the Sand,"" and ""Peruvian Skies""). When Dream and Day Unite (I've only listened to ""A Fortune in Lies,"" so I can't really comment).   Alternatively, listen to them in release order (except move WDaDU to after DT'13)."

It's a concept album that tells the story of a man who is trying to uncover memories that aren't of his own experiences. It's very progressive. In a similar style is the album Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Some of it gets heavy, but I think you'll appreciate it. The title track is like 43 minutes."

What you're hearing is the anticipation of 1 in each measure by a 16th - in other words, they make the ""downbeat"" hit on the e of 4 and don't play anything right on beat 1. You'll find it a lot in jazz and rock/punk.  Here's a good simple example, from the chorus of Everlong by the Foo Fighters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crOZk88eCcg#t=95"
Dreamtheater,2xn51c,Traejeek,5,Mon Mar 2 16:44:36 2015 UTC,It's just because Mikes vocals come in before the 1 but it's still in 4.
Dreamtheater,2xn51c,Villapwn,3,Mon Mar 2 06:59:01 2015 UTC,"Tap your foot at 4/4. It'll seem to desync with ""I!"" But quickly come back into beat as they're only accenting the fifteenth sixteenth note, but not resetting the signature."
Dreamtheater,2xn51c,JaysonnosyaJ,1 point,Mon Mar 2 17:01:44 2015 UTC,"By chorus, you mean the ""I want to stay alive"" part?  That's 4/4.  Much of the song isn't, but that is.    There's another song that has parts in 15/16 that feels like 4/4 until you get to the one missing 1/16 beat... can't remember what that one is off the top of my head."

Dreamtheater,2xn51c,FranticJ3,0,Tue Mar 3 16:05:59 2015 UTC,It certainly sounds like 4/4 to me.  Try counting 4/4 along with Mike's hi-hat hits.

Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,baddox,3,Mon Mar 2 02:23:03 2015 UTC,I literally like every track on the album. I don't understand the complaints
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,entityorion,1 point,Mon Mar 2 02:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's great too! I love all of the tracks together and apart, but I always wondered why all of the energy died about half way through each listen."
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,ktoddk99,5,Mon Mar 2 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"Portnoy had said that they tried the shorter songs (I Walk Beside You, The Answer Lies Within, Never Enough) because they had been writing long songs for so long that it had became difficult for them to write shorter songs, so they decided to attempt it. Plus they wanted to show that they enjoyed writing songs in many styles. To me, it's a better showcase album that the self titled. It just seemed to capture everything they can do in true DT fashion."
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,ktoddk99,2,Mon Mar 2 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"The other two ""short"" songs are great though, I just think that I Walk Beside You kills the whole energy given off from These Walls."
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,AugustoRudzinski,2,Mon Mar 2 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"I do think that track is a love it or hate it track, cause it is such a different sound than normal. I never cared much for it until I heard the vocal harmony part. That part made it become one of my favorites from the whole album."
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,Scizoid,3,Mon Mar 2 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"I love the whole album, and IWBY is not an exception. I know, it's a pop song, but it's so good to hear it in any mood you are in.  I'm in the little group of DT fans that likes their ballads and pop songs."
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,andrewdt10,3,Mon Mar 2 03:07:14 2015 UTC,Honestly I usually just listen to Root of All Evil and then skip to Sacrificed Sons. Probably the only DT album that I don't listen to straight through. Octavarium is the main attraction anyway.
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,AugustoRudzinski,2,Mon Mar 2 05:56:10 2015 UTC,"Wasn't 'I Walk Beside You' written during the Train of Thought writing sessions? Anyways, I love the album. It was the first DT album I got to listen to, so ill love it forever."
Dreamtheater,2xmcfv,YoshiYogurt,2,Mon Mar 2 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"Lots of wildly varying opinions on here, so I'll add my own controversial one:  For me, Octavarium is one of their worst albums. I think a big part of it is that Portnoy decided to do the majority of the songs on his John Bonham set with those awful single-ply dot heads, and the rest of the drums sound really tinny in comparison to other albums. The album before and the album after had drums that kicked you in the balls, but for some reason these were really weak for me.  It doesn't stop there...I'm like the only die-hard DT fan who thinks Octavarium the song is one of their weaker ""epic"" songs. I actually like IWBY, and I think Panic Attack and These Walls are great, but I think Never Enough is one of the absolute worst songs in their whole catalog.  I tend to like their albums to have a handful of blistering Petrucci riffs too, and this one doesn't really have that at all.  I've always found it really interesting how people who are just as much into this band as each other have such different views on which of their albums are good. It makes them a much more interesting band than other ones out there."

'Panic Attack' is ok, not a huge fan but its not something I skip. Same goes for 'Never Enough', its not (IMO) a great song but its not bad. However, 'Sacrificed Sons' I think of one of the absolute worst songs they ever did, along with 'The Great Debate' but that's another argument and album entirely.    If there was one song that doesn't fit on this album it would have to be 'The Answer Lies Within' which I think is a great song but it really seems out of place."

I do love Jordy and Derek both, but I feel like Kevin has the best grasp on melody and tone. Rudess can be a little over-ambitious at times IMO, and Sherinian has a quirky off-colour sense of melody that doesn't always fit DT, but Kevin always managed to just find the pocket and make it his own. I loved his input.  After that I'd probably say Rudess-era, then Sherinian-era, then Dominici-era, then Mangini-era.  EDIT: I should add, however, that if someone asked me, I would definitely call DT's ""classic"" lineup the SFAM-BC&SL group."

This shows for me his true skill, cause as a pianist, being able to make it in the classical scene means you're truly exceptional."

Great shows, but it was before they mixed up the setlist, so it was pretty much the same show.  Chicago was the best, I was able to get in the front row of the balcony.  Milwaukee's venue sounds like ass, but DT had their own PA and sound, so compared to other shows in the venue it sounded pretty good.  Minneapolis was decent too.     Fun fact:  I caught one of the drum heads that MP threw into the crowd at the Chicago show. (also had aftershow passes to get the rest of the band to sign that and my still unworn MET 2000 Jersey)   In my running list of DT shows, it was the 10th, 11th and 12th time seeing Dream Theater (I'm at 34 now... LOL)   2/11/2000 Minneapolis, MN (State Theater) w/ Dixie Dregs & Star People 2/12/2000 Milwaukee, WI (The Rave) w/ Dixie Dregs & Star People 2/13/2000 Chicago, IL (The Riviera) w/ Dixie Dregs & Star People  They really were firing on all cylinders that whole tour."

Dreamtheater,2wrm0h,vectorj,2,Sun Feb 22 17:13:55 2015 UTC,I was a little surprised that he basically played some riffs form that solo album (which is amazing).  It would've been really cool is he maybe did some Rush-inspired jamming instead. Maybe start with the intro riff from Spirit of the Radio and bust into some crazy arpeggios. Just a thought.

Dreamtheater,2wrm0h,Chitongs,3,Sun Feb 22 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"that was the most awkward, cringe-worthy product placement ever.  as for the material he played, im glad he played something with melody and structure, ie- muscial. rather than just shred like every other musician they have on that show.  they need to get better interviewers, though. i get the whole ""we're just hanging out"" vibe, but when you have the one and only Geddy Lee on the show, its pretty shallow to ask ""Does Neil ever just flip out and say he had a bad show?"" her dur dur.  ugh. I'd rather have Petrucci talk with Geddy. And if you notice, Geddy treated John and his question with much more thought and respect than any other question he got asked."
Dreamtheater,2wrm0h,san0648,3,Mon Feb 23 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was honestly pretty turned off by the hosts. I have never seen the show, but my first impression was they seemed to think highly of themselves the way they kept interrupting when the guests were trying to speak. I understand they have to be ""hosts"" but it was annoying when they were trying to be the center of attention."
Dreamtheater,2wrm0h,Chitongs,6,Mon Feb 23 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"That and you can tell none of them really care for material after Signals and before Snakes and Arrows. Not only in Geddy's ranked albums but also in just talking about the band and its history. When Trunk had to name 15 Rush albums he struggled after he got to Signals in chronological order. Meanwhile, in my head, i went through all 20 before he started to answer.  They're fans of 80's metal, 70's hard rock, and thats pretty much it. And it shows. It should be ""That Rock Show."""
Dreamtheater,2wrm0h,san0648,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"I was so excited to see Petrucci being the shred guy for an TMS episode. He's one of my favorite guitar players. Then when I saw it I was really disappointed. He's damn good at all sorts of shreds, and he just plays his solo tunes. And if he was not cut he would play them entirely! Not that I don't like the songs, but that's not the concept. He probably never watched the show. I wonder what Portnoy thought when he saw that. If they were still in speaking terms he would have explain him the basics."

I don't think he'll play with the band again for many years unless he were to return permanently following Mangini's departure.    Portnoy's shadow is still cast over Mangini's job, MP still wants to return, and a significant portion of the fans want him back.  A one-off show would only create more drama, especially if it went particularly well and members of the band start to divide over who they want to work with.  It isn't really the same for inviting Moore back, who didn't want to be in the band anymore, or Sherinian and Dominici, who joined the band after its formation and weren't there for a particularly long time.

Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,r3ynoldswrap,2,Tue Feb 17 13:22:31 2015 UTC,I agree
Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,AngrySquirrel,3,Tue Feb 17 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"Glad to see Systematic getting some recognition! I think Octavarium is possibly their finest song and they'll never top it, but as an album, I've always felt Systematic Chaos is stronger and more cohesive.   That being said, Octavarium is still a fine and diverse album. Not sure if that should be next, or Images and Words, but either way both are pretty essential!"
Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,AugustoRudzinski,4,Tue Feb 17 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"I listened to it twice to gather all the concepts. it has a lot of dark, hero and fantasy elements of what John petrucci says it's certainly an underrated album. In my opinion and not as viewed enough or recognized..."
Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,EquationTAKEN,2,Tue Feb 17 21:54:05 2015 UTC,Scenes is my favorite but I've been pounding 6DOIT these days.  Both About to Crashes are immense.

Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,Anticitizen_01,2,Tue Feb 17 10:47:00 2015 UTC,Awake. It has Scarred. Scarred has the single greatest guitar solo ever imagined in the categorized universe. Literally.
Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,rajicon,2,Tue Feb 17 11:06:15 2015 UTC,"Innocence Faded, Voices, Lie, Scarred... there's a lot of solo gold to be had on that album."
Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,the_boomr,2,Tue Feb 17 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"Awake is my favorite album, it was my first, but I still like it the most. 2nd is a tie between Scenes and six degree, then Images and Words, but it's all very close.  Blind Faith is one of my top DT songs, so that elevates the album a bit, but I still like the whole thing."
Dreamtheater,2w5r1q,seabeastmoose,1 point,Tue Feb 17 18:59:03 2015 UTC,Blind Faith I think is easily one of their top 10 songs. Personally I think its better then The Glass Prison.

Dreamtheater,2w3ued,philliplennon,11,Mon Feb 16 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"In release order:   When Dream And Day Unite: Skip this one for now. Images And Words: Considered by many the best one, if you don't mind a (very slightly) outdated sound give this one a go. Don't personally connect with it so much but Metropolis Pt. 1 and Learning To Live are tracks you must listen to. A Change Of Seasons: It's an EP with a single 20+ min epic of the same name. It's one of the best. Must listen if you don't mind longer songs. IMO very similar to the style you find in SFAM. Awake: My 3rd most favorite DT album and it's quite different from the rest. Moody, atmospheric, very focused and, to me, the one in which I can feel the most soul and heart put in by the band. Falling Into Infinity: Skip this one for now, though you must listen to Hollow Years (a ballad) and Hell's Kitchen (an instrumental). Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence: My 2nd favorite one. IMO the title track is the thing you should listen to now since it's the most similar in style to SFAM. The Glass Prison will definitely hook you up if you like metal. The rest of the tracks I absolutely love but they'll be tougher to swallow. Train Of Thought: If you are a metal fan listen to this one now since it's the heaviest of them all. Stream Of Consciousness is an absolutely gorgeous instrumental you must not miss anyhow. Honor Thy Father and In The Name Of God are metal as fuck but awesome tracks. Octavarium: Listen to this one if you want a softer, more melodic sound. It's very spacey and atmospheric. Octavarium, the title track is considered by many they're best song. It's fantastic, but IMO a bit hard to digest for someone new. Systematic Chaos: This one is very metal with a more modern and simpler structure. Definitely simpler to digest but it won't appeal to everyone. In The Presence Of Enemies, however, is IMO one of their best epics and I would dare to say a great place to start. Black Clouds And Silver Linings: Listen to The Count Of Tuscany here, you'll just know it when you hear it. It's just one of the best things I know to exist. A Dramatic Turn Of Events: It's a fun album with great and varied moments. the stand out track here is Breaking All Illusions, do yourself a favor and listen to it. Dream Theater (Self-titled): I'd say skip it for now."
Dreamtheater,2w3ued,iauu,6,Mon Feb 16 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"You can't really argue any of these points. I'd say about as spot on as spot on is going to get. I often find The Count of Tuscany's instrumental version to be a more favorable listen just because the original's lyrics are so inferior to something from, say, Awake. But the instrumental also lacks great parts from the original, as well. Elevates and lowers both hands so it's, like a lot of DT, a matter of perspective and the mood you're in, I guess. /u/philliplennon, if you're feeling adventurous, there's amazing live albums worth a listen too. I usually recommend Live At The Marquee or New York City 3/4/93 simply because LaBrie is INSANE on both early albums."

Dreamtheater,2w3ued,Mindflux,5,Mon Feb 16 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"If you like slightly heavier stuff, but not too metal, go to Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. The first half are individual songs, and the second half is a massive opera of a song.  If you like the similar style to SFAM, go to Images and Words.  If you like heavier stuff, go to Train of Thought and forwards, or back to Awake.  Personally, I like everything except the very first album (WDADU). I even like Falling into Infinity, even if it does have some of the worst DT songs."
Dreamtheater,2w3ued,dotonfire,2,Mon Feb 16 20:26:10 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I personally dislike both the first album and Falling Into Infinity

As for the similarity here, the time signature difference makes me chalk it up to coincidence.  The riff in MM is also just a simple ascending arpeggio, probably a scale, so it'd be prone to similarities in pieces using that same scale."

I'm a photographer and in our industry it's exactly the same. I've been doing this long enough that I leave 75% of my gear home when I used to take it all.  Part of it is that you realize more can be less. Part of it is pushing yourself to DO more with less. Part of it is you just hate fucking with so much shit. I bet his roadies and amp tech are thrilled.
Dreamtheater,2vnizs,sean_themighty,2,Thu Feb 12 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"That, and modern technology helps too. An AxeFX can't really be compared to any of the units he used back in the day. That said, his old tone had something this hasn't, and the other way around. Not saying his current tone is better or worse, but there is a big difference."

Live tone is a moving target. While no expense is spared when recording an album and you may double your budget just to get your sound from a 9 to a 10... Touring live you'll gladly take that 9 if it means half the work. And why wouldn't you? NO ONE will notice. You can't A/B anyway, and they are so, so close.  So yes, I totally understand what you mean. This live rig is missing a little x-factor from the old one... but at a show who would give a shit? ;-)"

Dreamtheater,2vl7l4,Scaramanga72,3,Thu Feb 12 04:14:33 2015 UTC,"Vanden Plas has some magnificent work I think often flies under the radar far too much. Let's see, I'm not sure where to tell you to begin though.  Their earlier albums, The God Thing and Beyond Daylight, are great. Both of which have a more melodic and less metal sound. Beyond Daylight is likely the closest album to what you're looking for.  Skip Far Off Grace.  Then there's the latest three: Christ 0, The Seraphic Clockwork, and Chronicles of the Immortals: Netherworld Path 1. All three are story-driven concept albums. And all three are amazing. Christ 0 has a great blend of melodic and metal. Seraphic is probably the heaviest. And Chronicles turns it down a notch to create an amazing atmosphere and ambiance.  If you're on the fence about sinking your teeth into a full album, here's a VP starter kit:  Christ 0 - January Sun  Christ 0 - Fireroses Dance  The Seraphic Clockwork - Rush of Silence  Beyond Daylight - Scarlet Flower Fields  The God Thing - Rainmaker (couldn't find the studio version)  I've been a huge, huge DT fan for quite some time, myself, so I hope you enjoy the recommendations. I find VP isn't too far off the beaten path from DT, but also has their own fantastically unique sound. And now that I'm gushing like an idiot over this band I'm fairly sure a full discography listen is happening today. Let me know what you think! Cheers!"

Dreamtheater,2vl7l4,Conspiracy795,2,Thu Feb 12 14:09:28 2015 UTC,"I absolutely have to recommend Manifesto for Futurism by Dali's Dilemma. There's something in the way these guys wrote their riffs, how they sync with the drums, the keys, that just makes this album feel like a distant cousin to Images and Words. The only way you could get closer is to have James Labrie singing with them.  In fact...  After the band dissolved after their only album, the guitarist and bassist did some session projects for a couple of Magna Carta projects, one of which was a Trent Gardner concept album called Leonardo - The Absolute Man, which James Labrie sang on. I'd liken the music more to Ayreon, but I think it's worth checking out as well.  Also, Dali's keyboardist (Matt Guillory) has played on all of James Labrie's solo/Mullmuzzler albums, though those are a little further away in terms of sound."

Dreamtheater,2vcqy0,AugustoRudzinski,8,Mon Feb 9 23:06:49 2015 UTC,I'm sure Portnoy's public criticisms of LaBrie's voice while he was still in the band probably didn't sit too well with James.

Dreamtheater,2vcqy0,Conrpnc,3,Tue Feb 10 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think a band lasts that long with true contempt amongst band members. However, egos being what they are and time being what it is, I think it's fair to say that they are not currently particularly friendly with each other. So I don't think they ""hate"" each other, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a reunion anytime soon either (not that everyone's looking for that or that you implied you were, just as a statement on the relationship)."
Dreamtheater,2vcqy0,kersey79,5,Tue Feb 10 00:38:58 2015 UTC,I heard Portnoy became a selfish asshole once he stopped drinking.

Dreamtheater,2vcqy0,IThoughtThisWasDigg,5,Wed Feb 11 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"I don't recall it just being about his voice, but his constant mistakes. You can find several videos on Youtube where JL would not only sing off-key, (but to be fair he did damage his vocal chords) but he would fumble lyrics and sing out of place.    One time in particular was at the end of a concert where they closed with Metropolis pt:1 and James started the closing lyrics about a bar too early and you can clearly see MP getting very angry over it.  Personally I like JL and I know he's not perfect but I would be dis-heartened if he were (or would have been) replaced."
Dreamtheater,2v7pdf,marcusthecrab,3,Sun Feb 8 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible, but there is a chance it will be similar to 2014, because it will only be a short tour. It's the anniversary of ACOS, though it's doubtful they'll play it just for a few festivals. It will most likely be a shorter show. We'll see.  Interested in this myself since they are coming to my town. I'll definitely go even though I've seen them last year."

Dreamtheater,2v7pdf,maximumrocker,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:43:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it'll be quite 'hit-heavy' because it's festivals but I'm hoping for something different from their tour last year.
Dreamtheater,2v7pdf,drrd777,2,Sun Feb 8 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'd guess it'll probably have some of the hits and probably some of the heavier songs too since a lot of them are metal festivals.

Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,mattymodotcom,8,Sun Feb 8 03:45:05 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why people complain about the vocals in bands like DT and Rush. As long as the singer's in tune, it doesn't bother me."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,kdjarlb,6,Sun Feb 8 06:18:08 2015 UTC,It's simply a matter of opinion
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Thatheistkid,6,Sun Feb 8 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"I do think the band is made by the others, but it's not like JLB is a steaming pile of garbage. Most of the time anyway. It's just kind of unfair to put him next to such amazing musicians that sorta steal the show, at least for me. He still has the right sound for them though and he's still good at what he does I think."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Templo,2,Sun Feb 8 04:53:38 2015 UTC,Anyone who thinks JLB is shit needs to hear his voice on early live recordings from 92 and 93. You can quite clearly see why DT picked him as their singer. Then he went and fucked up his throat with food poisoning and it was all downhill from there lol.
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,the_boomr,1 point,Wed Feb 18 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Unfortunate that it was such a small window of gloriousness. I do sorta wonder what things could've been like if he'd backed off for the recommended healing period, I guess I understand though."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Templo,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"One of the worst things about it is that as a trained musician, I can hear in a lot of his later performances in recent years that he's trying to sing how he would have with his 1993 Awake voice. And he just can't. Even if he didn't damage his throat, at this age he still wouldn't be able to sing like that. Ah well, I'm not his vocal coach."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,the_boomr,5,Wed Feb 18 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when listening to them live I agree. I'm also quite sceptical about the production of Breaking the Fourth Wall- LaBrie sounds great on it, but live videos from around the same time he's not as good."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Snidernomore,3,Sun Feb 8 04:10:14 2015 UTC,I saw them last year in San Francisco and he sounded great.
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Bokthand,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:27:53 2015 UTC,And you are entitled to that opinion. But there is a large contingent of the fanbase who doesn't think he's very good.
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Snidernomore,2,Tue Feb 10 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fairly widely accepted that at least some parts of the vocals and guitar parts are studio-dubbed in Breaking the Fourth Wall. There was the one clip they released of a Petrucci solo where the audio was either dubbed, or the video was really out of sync."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,baddox,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:32:37 2015 UTC,"I mentioned B4W because whenever LaBrie is talked about on this sub the impression I get is that everybody thinks he is much improved based on his performance there, but I definately think that there was heavy editing.  I prefer that though. I would rather LaBrie be edited to sound better. He's ok a lot of the time, but some times he can take a performance and ruin it himself."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Snidernomore,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"I prefer the opposite. If I buy a Live recording I want it to be as close to the original as possible. The edits kind of ruined the last 2 DVDs for me (partly).  That said, I don't LaBrie think needs to be edited to sound good. He has a marvelous voice, one of the best in metal theses days up there with Dickinson, Allen etc. They all have their share of slip ups.... Just listen to this version of Scarred, without any editing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84mcADgR9d8. I don't think DT could have ended up with a better singer."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,naranha,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:15:56 2015 UTC,"I prefer the same as you, but an edited LaBrie sounds much more bearable at times than an unedited one.  And you are entitled to your opinion, but it's more than slip ups. He is not consistant at all with his singing, especially in the live videos I've watched."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Snidernomore,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:07:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen Dream Theater 5 times since 2008. second show was 2009, on the BC&SL tour, saw them in San Jose. JLB literally sounded perfect the entire show. I was blown away, considering how he sounds on a ton of live recordings from basically late 90s onward. Most recent time I saw them was late 2013 I think, right after ADToE released, in San Francisco. JLB did not sound nearly as good. He was just shouting/screaming most of the old crazy high melodies (like Surrounded), which is not pleasant, and you can tell he's not using any kind of good technique. It was so sad for me to witness, because I know he has the technique in him somewhere to sound fantastic, based on that San Jose show in 2009. I've even gone to find fan recordings from that exact show on YouTube, and I wasn't imagining how good he sounded. He really was spot-on."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,the_boomr,5,Wed Feb 18 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"Geez, I know DT gets a little knock cuz of JLB's vox, but who would have thought it'd be THAT bad?    hrmph."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,Bokthand,3,Sun Feb 8 03:45:49 2015 UTC,"I personally have come to love Labrie's vocals. I hated them for at least 1-2 years when I first got into the band, but I stuck through for the music. After awhile I started to realize is a very talented vocalist. I was in almost the exact same situation with Coheed and Claudio is now one of my favorite vocalists. It's just not mainstream appealing.  Labrie also sounds really good in his recent solo stuff."
Dreamtheater,2v5rmy,the_boomr,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Ugh sorry to disagree but I honestly really hate the way JLB sounds in his solo recordings, and unfortunately, since Portnoy left, that's the sound we've been getting in DT too.  Now I'm not one of those Portnoy fanboys who hates Mangini and refuses to accept Dream Theater without Portnoy as the drummer, and honestly I love Mangini even more now, but I really secretly feel like Portnoy's bossy attitude toward JLB in particular is one of the things that actually helped JLB's voice return to a very good state, using good technique and singing properly, not just shouting out the high notes like he does at live shows nowadays. I feel guilty for saying that. But it feels so true."

The upshot is that the performance becomes more precise. A common criticism is it doesn't really leave room for improvisation and spontaneity, but some drummers like it, others don't."
Dreamtheater,2udqgx,Zabunia,4,Sun Feb 1 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"That being said, improvisation is relatively uncommon in prog music for the most part, outside of solos (unless its specifically an improve section)"
Dreamtheater,2udqgx,BCJunglist,7,Sun Feb 1 12:24:12 2015 UTC,Mangini does. But the issue with that is if you have problems with your in-ear monitors then you'll have a difficult time hear the players around you. Like Jordan and Johns fast lines together  Ex: Dream Theater live in Singapore. They had technical difficulties during all of the song Outcry. (as well as other parts in the show) As you guys know. The middle section is nuts. Here is a video of them literally getting through the whole song and remaining in time and together. Absolutely mindblowing  http://youtu.be/muBkquxoFkI?t=4m28s  CHECK IT OUT

Dreamtheater,2udqgx,maximumrocker,5,Mon Feb 2 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"Evidence that MP didn't use one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_RuBLCPPjk The band was supposed to do a instrumental medley here but James came in early. With a click track, the band wouldn't have been able to follow James' (incorrect) lead, and things would have gotten sloppy.   I saw a video once of MM messing up DoE embarrassingly bad, but I can't find the video. Without a click track, the band would have like recovered much sooner. Click tracks allow for really cool synchronization of visual and back tracks, but they are also very unforgiving."
Dreamtheater,2udqgx,spacecatapult,3,Mon Feb 2 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"MP also had a tendency to play too fast. Now that there's a click track involved, the tempo matches the studio recording, but it sometimes sounds slower (because I'm used to it being played a little faster live). Something to do with the excitement of a live setting, I guess."

Dreamtheater,2udqgx,Madljdude,1 point,Mon Feb 2 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"I think the best evidence that he doesn't use a click track is just watching any of their shows. Live @ Budokan comes to mind...the band stays together very well, but Portnoy fluctuates the tempo like mad throughout all their songs, and it kind of drives me nuts.  There's a very noticeable difference in the tightness of the band pre- and post- Portnoy, in my opinion."
Dreamtheater,2udqgx,2_Wycked,3,Mon Feb 2 02:53:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, they started playing to a click track once Mike Mangini joined the band."
Dreamtheater,2udqgx,jeauxoxo,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:58:35 2015 UTC,I don't think they did before Mangini. When I saw them live in Sydney they botched the end of Metropolis a couple of times and had to go back and do it over. I can't imagine that would be easy with a click track...
Dreamtheater,2udqgx,the_boomr,1 point,Sun Feb 1 06:31:07 2015 UTC,"I get that they have tons and tons of all these cool audio effects these days that they have to make sure stay synced up to the music during the live performances, but the one thing that irks me is that when they brought Mangini on, there was a quote Petrucci stated in some interview or another along the lines of Mangini having such good time that he's literally like a human metronome, and can play in the front, middle, or back of every single beat, as he chooses, and stay perfectly in time. Well, if he's so good at keeping strict time (obviously important for the drummer in DT), then why couldn't they let him shine by not using click tracks live? I would've loved to see MM show up Portnoy's old performances by never speeding up...all the time lol. Not trying to bash on Portnoy too much, I still love him as well."
Dreamtheater,2udqgx,hostilecrotch,2,Sun Feb 1 08:42:17 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Playing to a click is actually very difficult and takes away from the spontaneity of a performance. These guys practise like hell and are good enough to stay on time without it.

Dreamtheater,2u5vhd,turdburgers,3,Fri Jan 30 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"Images and Words will sound dated, but it really is the beginning of the band and informs every other album. For their true masterpieces, check out either Awake or Metropolis 2: Scenes from a memory. For heavier stuff, check out Train of Thought. For vintage DT, try Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence or Octavarium. For tighter song writing and a bit lighter feel, check out their self titled album released in 2013.  IMO."
Dreamtheater,2u5vhd,lenguataco,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:53:37 2015 UTC,People say Images sounds dated but I don't get that.  It still sounds as great to me now as it did in the 90s.  I actually think the rereleased tracks sound worse than the originals.

Dreamtheater,2u5vhd,Thatheistkid,2,Fri Jan 30 12:54:32 2015 UTC,"People are saying Images and Words. Honestly it's a good pick but if you don't like that album at first move on to Awake. My only advice is to sit down and listen to either album front to back without touching the skip button. You may find some of the songs have to develop a bit before you can appreciate then, so changing the song 30 seconds in to Learning to Live or Scarred won't give you enough time to develop an opinion on the song."
Dreamtheater,2u5vhd,kakacha,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"Probably Images and Words or Scenes From a Memory if you want the awesome progressive/technical stuff. But, if you wanna go with something HEAVY and technical, go with Train of Thought or Systematic Chaos. Many people will probably disagree with the two last albums I recommended, but I personally think they're some of their best albums. Every album they've made is awesome in a unique way."

Dreamtheater,2u1k3p,Twat_Waffle_,3,Thu Jan 29 03:48:16 2015 UTC,I was gonna say this but was afraid down votes cause this sub sometimes has a raging hate boner for it.
Dreamtheater,2u1k3p,BCJunglist,2,Thu Jan 29 18:43:51 2015 UTC,Lol I learned the hard way I guess.  Sucks to know DT is so awesome but their fans can be complete dicks to eachother.  It's not my favorite song I just love how it ends.
Dreamtheater,2u1k3p,Twat_Waffle_,4,Thu Jan 29 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"I feel that may be because of the changes of style varied from record to record... It seems like every album creates a new pocket of fans that dislike a different variety of their work. Some fans of awake era albums hate some of the mellower and peppier tunes. Some fans of scenes era album hate the more metal oriented octavarium and tot albums. Some of the fans of the newest 2 or 3 albums sometimes tend to hate the softer prog found in images and words and falling into infinity....  Obviously that's not exclusively true and some fans (myself included) celebrate the whole variety of work... But I think its obvious some fans have drawn some lines in the sand, so much so that many fans of the older stuff have stated they only listened to one or two songs from the DT album and decided they hate the whole thing and all new music from the band."
Dreamtheater,2u1k3p,BCJunglist,-22,Thu Jan 29 20:42:58 2015 UTC,"OP asked for BEST ending. Not ones from shitty songs with lame happy-feel-good endings. Oh, they were telling a horror story but totally misunderstood the dude so it's all good now? Okay, that would have been fine if the lyrics didn't have the creative depth of a middle school essay and the music had a general lack of cohesiveness. But mostly those lyrics. So bad. Like distractingly so.  Hate that song. It has a few cool musical moments, but is seriously the most overrated DT song ever. And they've been my favorite band for almost 20 years. What do I know, though? I think their most recent album was a huge letdown, too."

Dreamtheater,2u1k3p,sean_themighty,5,Thu Jan 29 05:16:59 2015 UTC,"And they've been my favorite band for almost 20 years. What do I know, though?   Well you clearly don't know that musical tastes are subjective and that its perfectly OK for someone to have different tastes to you."

If the therapist was planning on repeating the cycle from the very beginning, why even bother going through the process of the therapy in the first place? Seems like the author got a bit overzealous with his interpretation there, as that just opens up a massive inconsistency in the story. Other than that, this was an interesting skim."
Dreamtheater,2tojfe,vdemon,0,Fri Apr 17 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"SFAM has always been my favourite DT album... despite the multiple breaking revelations I had in the past 15 years. And by ""revelation"", I'm referring to obvious influences/plagiarism that DT slipped in this album.  ex: I was devastated when I discovered ""I want you"" from the Beatles, years after I had listened and cherished ""Fatal Tragedy""... But even with these admitted ""influences"", I still have a enormous amount of respect for that cult album."
Dreamtheater,2tojfe,giantpandasonfire,3,Mon Jan 26 12:57:02 2015 UTC,"DT has a ton of those though in several songs.  But to be fair if you listen to a lot of music, you are going to hear people copping riffs and lyrics from each other all the time.  That's nothing to be devastated over.  If anything it's a way for them to show homage to their favorite bands.  People take DT to be as serious as their music...but then they seem to forget that things like Nightmare Cinema and Nicky Lemons and the Migraines exists."

Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,lomoeffect,4,Sat Jan 10 01:36:02 2015 UTC,These are my reasons Haken took DTs spot for my favorite band. Everything is always fresh and pushing a new musical threshold for them.
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,Beasty_Billy,3,Sun Jan 11 05:45:54 2015 UTC,Haken is pretty dank.
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,DownvoteBrigade80,1 point,Mon Jan 12 06:15:06 2015 UTC,Haken is amazing in the studio.  Has anyone here actually seen them?
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,mrgrubbage,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:20:21 2015 UTC,Their live performances are rough is what I've gathered from youtube. Studio albums are masterpieces though.
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,DownvoteBrigade80,5,Thu Jan 29 20:33:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree only a little.  Also, I know I'm 2 days late but shush about that.  I think ADToE was a fantastic album the showcases all that the band has to offer.  It felt like I was listening to them for the first time again but it also felt like I was greeting an old friend, which (as paradoxical as it sounds) is something I like.  I liked it because it wasn't Black Clouds.  It wasn't cramming 6 mini-epics on one record.  Every song was lengthened appropriately.  Finally, I do agree that DT12 was a problem.  I think it was trying too hard to be Octavarium.  They've already done an album with an amazing closing epic which was followed by some songs that all were a little strange relative to the normal DT style (compare every song to the classic rendition of it; ""The Enemy Inside"" vs ""Pull me Under"" or Backs/Angels.  I don't know what the classic soft DT song is, so I'm not gonna attempt that one).  Dream Theater needs to sit out a few years.  Hell, do what Tool does and tour a ton when they're not/can't writing (what do you think they've done in the 8 years since 10K?).  They do need a bit of a break.  I would like to see another concept album or another super heavy album come from them."
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,sonickarma,5,Mon Jan 12 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"DT12, ADTOE, and BC&SL all sound vastly different from each other. I don't see how you think they sound identical."
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,the_boomr,3,Mon Jan 12 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, however I also still agree with OP that it seems they're not doing much innovation anymore."
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,SneakyNoob,8,Fri Jan 16 01:23:55 2015 UTC,"A Dramatic Turn of Events is one of my top 3 DT albums. That album had so much grace and feeling. It didnt take itself seriously and it felt hand crafted. It felt more mature than previous albums, and thats not a bad thing its just different.    I think the Self Titled album did its job perfectly. JP and JR stated in many interviews that they wanted to ""trim the fat"" off the Dream Theater formula and it worked REALLY well. All of the songs that wanted to have a crazy instrumental solo section did. The Enemy Inside, Enigma Machine, Behind the Veil, Surrender to Reason and Illumination all had their crazy moments while staying shorter than normal (minus illum theory). Mangini's groove and technical ability was also extremely apparent in the album. I dont judge albums off their previous work , i judge albums off of what the artists state they want it to sound like from interviews."
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,Mindflux,-1,Sat Jan 10 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"LOL well, Ya if you judge an album by what the artist says about it nearly every album becomes a masterpiece."

Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,enndeee,-7,Sat Jan 10 01:13:51 2015 UTC,A Dramatic Turn of Events is a horrible DT album by their standards!!! They tried to copy Images and Words and the album is the first were I agree with their harshest critics...just mindless shredding and not feeling!!

They don't really joke around like they used to, and MM's personality is just wooden compared to MP's. I don't feel energy in their new albums, I just feel like they want to just crank out something every 2 years so they have something to tour with.  I do agree that they should have listened to MP and taken a break."
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,enndeee,2,Thu Jan 15 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"You are so right.  I just posted about this yesterday in r/dreamtheater.

I can definitely see were youre coming from saying they dont sound like fresh or innovative and the tracks mostly sound like ""typical"" DT songs, but I personally don't think much of it. I'm pretty sure that the goal of DT12 was said to be to make a classic DT album that showcased the best of what the band was known for, which is why they went with self titling it. If thats the case, it's not really surprising that they arent breaking too much ground.  And about the piano driven song and acoustic song you were asking for, IMO Far From Heaven and Beneath the Surface were the best two tracks off of ADTOE."
Dreamtheater,2rwt3y,enndeee,2,Sat Jan 10 01:19:09 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the recent albums at all, they're good.. I've thought to myself that If I were a new DT fan and picked up the most recent albums that I would have been blown away by them... Which I feel is true.. but I am not that new fan.. which is where I am getting the feeling of fatigue with the stagnancy in the band's sound.   And you are correct about those tracks you mentioned, those are good ones... I was prattling off ideas of what I'd like to hear more of."

Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,AbraKdabra,2,Fri Jan 9 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"""Might could be"" is a phrase commonly said by Misha Mansoor, frontman of Periphery, the band referenced in /u/kakacha's comment by ""This Time It's Personal"", referring to the name of their second studio album.  In other words, it was a joke. M3 is unlikely to actually happen, obviously."

Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,the_boomr,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:17:12 2015 UTC,But this will only be the 2nd album they wrote with Mangini. ADToE was written before Mangini was on board.

Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,klyt,4,Fri Jan 16 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"Anyone else think they didn't tour that much to support the self-titled? I liked what they did with ADToE where they started even before it came out to actually promote the album, and then halfway through that tour they started playing songs from the album that they hadn't played yet (such as Lost Not Forgotten). I would have loved with the self-titled tour to see them play other songs like Behind the Veil and The Bigger Picture."
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,ubiblur,2,Fri Jan 9 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think the 2nd leg of the ADToE tour sold very well, so they probably nixed a 2nd leg for DT12."
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,cth1ic_warrior,4,Fri Jan 9 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm glad for more DT music but the last one I've maybe listened to about 3 times and it spent the rest of the time picking up dust on my shelves.   Really left a ""meh"" feeling with me. From the song writing down to the production. Which is a shame as I felt A Dramatic Turn of Events showed them going back to ""classic"" DT. Stepping away from the overly polish drums of Black Clouds and Systematic Chaos. More soaring melodies and overall better sound and when they have one of the most technically proficient and gifted drummers in the world they think it is a good thing to make his drums sound dull, flat, and lifeless on the self titled?"
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,AbraKdabra,2,Fri Jan 9 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. ADTOE is my fav since Scenes/Images and I love the melodies on every track. S/T is okay, but even Illumination Theory is way too bloated. It just lacks a single 'classic' in my eyes."
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,DarkwingDuckAvenger,3,Mon Jan 12 01:57:17 2015 UTC,Glad to hear about this.

Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,maximumrocker,1 point,Fri Jan 9 16:44:16 2015 UTC,That or they need to write something in a different direction.  I find they are a lot less harder or metal since mike P left.
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,broncosrb26,2,Fri Jan 9 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"Apparently I'm in the minority that really loved the self-titled album. I wasn't as big on ADTOE, but there are some songs from that album that I really dig. Enemy Inside, The Looking Glass, Behind the Veil, Surrender to Reason and Illumination Theory I think are right up there with everything else that they have done.  I'm excited to see what they do next. /u/kakacha talked about metropolis 3, I know in the past someone in the band mentioned they would like to do another concept album sometime, I think that would be cool for them to do, but I'm excited regardless!"
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,Nightmare_Cinema,1 point,Fri Jan 9 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really liked self-titled. I wasn't a huge fan of Illumination Theory; the middle orchestrated part was pretty and epic but too long, and the big grandiose ending was flat, but everything else was fantastic. ADTOE, I played out, and it's still good to listen to, but it's starting to slip out of favor."
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,SiriusC,2,Thu Jan 15 18:26:06 2015 UTC,Im excited!
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,FractalAudio,7,Sun Jan 18 18:10:27 2015 UTC,Ugh. They need to take some time off to get the creative juices flowing again because the last few albums haven't had it.
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,DarkwingDuckAvenger,11,Fri Jan 9 01:25:35 2015 UTC,"Finally someone who said what's been on my mind. It's an unpopular opinion but I think it's necessary. They're getting tunnel vision.  Portnoy wanted this and I didn't appreciate him for saying it back then, but I do see where he was coming from.  Edit: But I'm still excited beyond belief that a new album is coming out, and I'll tell every living soul willing to listen to me blabber on about how much I'm looking forward to it."

Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,maximumrocker,3,Tue Jan 13 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm a much 'newer' fan of Dream Theater (saw them open up for Maiden in 2010 and didn't get around to exploring their awesome catalog until around 2013), and even I feel that Octavarium was the last album that had that 'magic' quality to it, whereas Maiden's newer albums have consistently topped the classics for me. I'm not comparing the two bands. I'm simply demonstrating that as a 'young' listener to both Maiden and DT, nostalgia doesn't factor in to my views on the discography as a whole; I've seen a lot of long-time Iron Maiden fans on the titular subreddit bitch at anyone who dares to list any of the post-1999 songs as their favorites alongside the classics, and this same side of the fanbase always gets shouty whenever Maiden goes on tour for a new album due to the fact that they tend to focus on newer songs during said tours. A lot of fans' standards are way too ingrained in the past. It makes me sad.  Anyway, Maiden's 'Resurgence' albums have consistently blown me away, but for DT, Systematic onward just doesn't do it for me. Like, I only go back and listen to around 2-3 songs from each post-Octavarium album. Yes, In The Presence of Enemies is fantastic, but I consider this to be the last 'magical' song of their career. Black Clouds has The Count of Toucan Sam, which is a pretty good song in terms of instrumentation, but the subject matter and lyrics are a bit too exaggerated and silly for my tastes. A Nightmare to Remember could have been something amazing, but everyone knows what ruined that one. Other than these two, I really don't care for anything else on Black Clouds. The Shattered Fortress is pretty damned good when listening to the Twelve Step Suite all the way through, but I wouldn't bother with it otherwise. Same goes for Repentance off Systematic Chaos.  ADToE fared a bit better, though; I love OTBoA, Bridges in the Sky and Breaking All Illusions. While still not up to that 'classic' DT quality, they're pretty fun songs. Everything else is pretty forgettable to me. As for the self-titled, I like the False Awakening Suite, The Enemy Inside, Enigma Machine, and I'll occasionally listen to Illumination Theory whenever I simply want to rock out for twenty minutes, but I definitely think it's their weakest epic thus far.  Granted, every DT album has a track or three that doesn't do it for me, but the ratio is shifting in the other direction with every new release it seems. Their new albums are just so underwhelming. I'm hoping they have a few tasty surprises planned for this upcoming record.  EDIT: Words."
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,sonickarma,5,Mon Jan 12 04:52:36 2015 UTC,I actually really enjoy most of ADTOE. I find it to be their best album since Octavarium.
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,Zabunia,1 point,Fri Jan 9 02:35:34 2015 UTC,You ever think Portnoy might have been onto something when he suggested they take a break and not drain the creative reservoir dry?
Dreamtheater,2rsi9k,sonickarma,1 point,Mon Jan 12 02:31:48 2015 UTC,"See, I can see both sides here. For me personally when I stop doing something it takes a lot of effort to get back into it.  And I might not have the same intensity as just continuing on. Other artist have had this happen. They take a break come back and the albums falls short.   But, the flip side. Again from personal experience is taking a break is needed. When I do my work out programs, I usually have a week or two to ""De-load"" and let my body recover after I finish the programs.  I see from both sides. Another example is the ""Great White Dead Composers"" of classical music. They literally made music up til they died. Some of Mozarts, and Beethovens greatest works came later in their careers.   Like I said, creativity is a two way street. Kind of like a muscle. You have to keep it working to build it stronger. But, like a muscle it fatigues and it needs some breaks"
Dreamtheater,2rqscg,enndeee,8,Thu Jan 8 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have to all ""sound classic"". Their sound has evolved over time, that's what things do over time. I personally think they've done a great job keeping their signature while still evolving, and I find they've got a pretty even spread of good stuff throughout the whole discography. If your personal preference is for the older stuff that's fine, doesn't mean they need a break though. Can't please everyone all the time. They've got such a wide variety of things, you can see even just from the handful of comments you have that everyone likes and doesn't-like-as-much totally different albums and songs. Best bet is just if they churn out more stuff."
Dreamtheater,2rqscg,Templo,7,Thu Jan 8 18:59:38 2015 UTC,Even though I agree with you I would add The Count Of Tuscany and Breaking All Illusions as absolutely classic tracks I could not live without.

Come on, having some fun in the studio is proof of them being bored over the songwriting process? Bands aren't allowed to have any fun in the studio? You could maybe make the argument for MP since he left, but why would the rest of the band even bother if they weren't interested in it? LaBrie's solo stuff is pretty good, JP could do just about anything he wanted. I know some people aren't happy with the past few albums for whatever reasons, but this is a bit of a stretch."

Well yeah, maybe it was a bit of a stretch to say that the rest of the band was bored, but I still see how MP in is head is like 'oh my god we've done this exact same thing dozens of times before oh my god aaa'. I completely understand his reasons to take the band on a hiatus, because to me DT is now a sterile music-making machine, but what can ya do eh... At least they're still touring so we have that going for us which is nice."
Dreamtheater,2rqscg,DownvoteBrigade80,3,Sat Jan 10 09:48:50 2015 UTC,"A Dramatic Turn of Events was pretty great imo, and SC and BC have a lot of standout tracks too."
Dreamtheater,2rqscg,IThoughtThisWasDigg,3,Thu Jan 8 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't stand ADTOE, it is everything I hated about DT amplified to 100 due to being in a really awkward drummer transition where JP wrote all the drum parts (it really shows...)  DT13 is much better, but goddamn ADTOE is living proof that they should have put their foot on the brakes."
Dreamtheater,2rqscg,threeply,-4,Thu Jan 22 03:15:05 2015 UTC,Wow I think that album is borderline unlistenable

Dreamtheater,2rotte,FlyingMudBear,5,Thu Jan 8 00:37:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say their new self-titled or Octavarium would be a safe place to start. Actually, no, listen to Metropolis Pt 2 first. All the way through."
Dreamtheater,2rotte,Hamlet7768,2,Thu Jan 8 00:43:06 2015 UTC,Listen to it all! From MP2 to Octavarium
Dreamtheater,2rotte,snesknight,2,Thu Jan 8 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"Their new album is more like PT than some of their old albums, but personally I don't like it. Black Clouds and Silver Linings is a really quality album and of course Metropolis Pt. 2 is a must."
Dreamtheater,2rotte,ImWhite_Thankfully,1 point,Thu Jan 8 02:06:48 2015 UTC,"Dude, I love Porcupine Tree. Such a fantastic band. Back on topic - pretty much what's been mentioned so far. The self titled seemed to be hit or miss between DT fans. I personally enjoyed it quite a bit, mostly just fresh, new Dream Theater with a different drummer at the helm while still maintaining all of their good qualities, it's definitely a staple in their discography in my opinion.   If you like more Deadwing-style, give Octavarium, Black Clouds and Silver Linings, A Dramatic Turn of Events and Dream Theater (self titled) a list.   If you like more Lightbulb Sun/In Absentia-styles, give Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (first disc especially!!) a listen.  Hope this helps!"
Dreamtheater,2rotte,DarkwingDuckAvenger,3,Thu Jan 8 05:23:23 2015 UTC,Man I really wish Steven Wilson returns to PT sometime in the near future...

Dreamtheater,2rotte,recentlydiscovered,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:53:26 2015 UTC,"I would recommend SDOIT, it's their best album IMO.  Others have recommended the new self titled, but I'm not really a fan of it.  Black Clouds and Silver Linings I think is one of the better albums in their recent output."
Dreamtheater,2rotte,deathbirdstories,1 point,Thu Jan 8 08:29:39 2015 UTC,"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is a good album to get the full range, but honestly you'd be better off with a live release. I suggest Score or Live at Budokan, but the newest self titled record ( and new associated live release, Breaking the Fourth Wall) are exceptional."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,philliplennon,16,Tue Jan 6 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"Images and Words and Scenes from a Memory.  I definitely would recommend avoiding Awake (it's great, but not for beginners)"
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,rajicon,2,Tue Jan 6 20:39:43 2015 UTC,Images is a 22 year old album...how old is the poster?
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,cth1ic_warrior,3,Tue Jan 6 23:33:28 2015 UTC,i'm 18
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,cth1ic_warrior,2,Tue Jan 6 23:52:42 2015 UTC,Images and Words might sound a little dated to you if you're 18.   Start with DTs latest album and work your way back.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Viter,18,Wed Jan 7 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"That's a horrible idea. Images and words is a great beginner album choice. Or pick single songs like panic attack, the dark eternal night etc"
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,cth1ic_warrior,4,Wed Jan 7 02:21:06 2015 UTC,Panic attack and dark eternal night are not easy listens for a new DT listener.   Images and Words is a 1992 album. You're telling a kid who wasn't even born until 1995-1996 to listen to a song like Another Day or Surrounded?   We have to put nostalgia aside and realize that putting DTs easiest and most accessible songs first to a new listener is a better idea.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Viter,6,Wed Jan 7 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"No because people like Dt because of their prog, like metropolis and learning to live, if he wants to introduce someone they are probably already into it. Also dream theaters accessible songs are really mediocre and will give the wrong impression"
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,cth1ic_warrior,3,Wed Jan 7 09:22:57 2015 UTC,I like all DT stuff.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Viter,2,Wed Jan 7 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"Hey me 2, but Dt aren't known for their accessible songs for a reason."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,cth1ic_warrior,2,Wed Jan 7 13:29:53 2015 UTC,True.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,IncendiaryLemon88,3,Wed Jan 7 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a fairly new DT fan, I'm only 17 and I think that Images and Words is probably one of their best albums of the ones I've heard so far. The only song I don't really like too much is Another Day, but Surrounded is one of my favourites personally."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,cth1ic_warrior,3,Wed Jan 7 12:00:07 2015 UTC,"I would disagree.  They're both outright metal songs.  Hell, Panic Attack got me into Dream Theater altogether."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Artistp,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:59:09 2015 UTC,Doesn't Sound that dated to me  It sounds fresh!!!  Their first album without James is the weakest in my book
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,TCSnypz,3,Wed Jan 7 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, though there are some flashes of brilliance on the first album but Dominici is just not the right singer for them, as they found out as well."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,TFOLLT,2,Wed Jan 7 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"You're right, still I miss those JP solos from Fortune In Lies and Killing Hand, they were one of their kind and he haven't came back to this style since 89 unfortunately. Less shredding more technical passages"

Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Lankles,5,Tue Jan 6 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"For me it was Systematic Chaos. Not my favorite album by any means, but there is some wicked tracks on it and that's what drew me in.  My first favorite song that I could listen to on repeat all day was Beyond This Life."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,giantpandasonfire,2,Tue Jan 6 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"same, beyond this life got me into DT. I'd recommend you A Dramatic Turn of Events, really got me to appreciate the band and started working from this album to the others. Their last album was a bit disappointment imo so would skip this one."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Crysalim,2,Wed Jan 7 09:36:15 2015 UTC,"This is how I got into DT too.  But now, Scenes, Images and Octavarium are my favorites."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,LunacyNow,10,Wed Jan 7 18:17:35 2015 UTC,Scenes from a Memory IMO  Maybe Train of Thought if said newcomer has a hard rock or heavy metal bent.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,x1n30,5,Tue Jan 6 22:57:51 2015 UTC,"Images and Words for sure.  That's THE definitive DT album IMO.  After that, go with Scenes from a Memory.  Afterwards it's up to you...to be quite honest, I'd say go with Awake as it is without a doubt my favorite album.  It's different for sure but still a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful album to listen to."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,TheWindWaker01,6,Tue Jan 6 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"Train of Thought is the primer for ""new school"" Dream Theater, when they had a lot of metal influence.  The last two albums have been unique because of Mike Mangini, and you can save those for later.  The universally accepted best album is Scenes from a Memory and is the best intro to the pre-ToT era."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,cscolley,4,Wed Jan 7 04:01:03 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go with Awake - just about every song is awesome.  The first song I ever hear from that album was The Mirror/Lie.  Actually I saw it live and it was amazing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-k2JSZd_Qw
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,jacktheBOSS,2,Wed Jan 7 00:07:09 2015 UTC,When they came back from interval right into The Mirror on the latest tour...oh lord.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Piernitas,5,Thu Jan 8 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly man, you should listen to Score. Score just takes some of the greatest songs they've written and puts them in an amazing live setting."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,LiquorballSandwich,5,Wed Jan 7 02:15:46 2015 UTC,Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. It has the classic elements of older DT while having newer (more metal) elements of DT.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Chexling,2,Wed Jan 7 00:35:37 2015 UTC,"I was going to say this, surprised that not many people have. Sound wise it feels like a middle ground between albums that came before and after it."
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,TabsAZ,3,Wed Jan 7 01:31:34 2015 UTC,Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (Disc 2) is very approachable for a new fan. A lot less experimental/progressive stuff going on.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Cristolink,3,Wed Jan 7 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"Scenes from a Memory is the best start.  It has everything Dream Theater, from sick riffs and solos to ballads and everything in between.  Next, I would look at Images and Words, then either Octavarium or Train of Thought.  From there, pave your own way.  I would say When Dream and Day Unite and Awake should be saved for last, however."

Dreamtheater,2rjrah,Iamametameta,3,Tue Jan 6 21:37:42 2015 UTC,I've heard that whatever DT album you had first becomes your favourite. For me it's scenes from a memory.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,JaysonnosyaJ,2,Wed Jan 7 00:12:11 2015 UTC,That actually seems to make sense. Not a lot of people are fans of FII and I absolutely love it! It was the first album I've heard and the first songs I've heard were Panic Attack then The Dance of Eternity and those are two of my favorite.
Dreamtheater,2rjrah,naranha,2,Wed Jan 7 04:28:50 2015 UTC,"Not true for me. Awake was my first, but SFAM is my fav."

Dreamtheater,2ricq4,SinisterMinisterX,2,Tue Jan 6 12:49:43 2015 UTC,I got Making of SFAM a few years ago (2009 or so) and the same thing. The CD took a month or two longer to arrive than I thought it would. I had given up on it by the time it arrived. Haven't done business with them since.

I attempted that, and even though I have a high tenor range, I had nowhere near that amount of support to sustain the entire song like he did.  I am also a vocalist (albeit not as good as Lyon), and LaBrie is one of my favorites. If you want to see a video of me with my acapella group, I can PM you."

Dreamtheater,2r5u46,Skwiggity,3,Sat Jan 3 05:45:04 2015 UTC,"Petrucci solos are hard. There are only a few songs I can do start-to-finish, and sadly none of them are the ones you mention. I don't think Spirit should be too hard though, since it's one of his less intricate songs.  I can do Scarred, Erotomania, Looking Glass, and most of the songs from SFAM (haven't completely nailed the Fatal Tragedy solo)."
Dreamtheater,2r5u46,BigE42984,2,Sat Jan 3 04:27:43 2015 UTC,"That they are. Tough to nail!  Spirit is a fun song, hopefully we can. Scarred, never heard same with erotomania, (not sure what album those are from) So i'll check those out, and Looking glass is a great song, but Mangini is a monster, I'll try my best. I can try a portnoy version of that song, worst scenario.  SFAM, is fun, not a fan of Fatal Tragedy anyways, so I think we're in business if you're interested.  Questions: Can you record your guitar and make it sound similar to Petrucci? Also, Do you have an HD video camera?"

The main problem I see them encountering is how they would do the vocal harmonies in the choruses that Styx like to use so much. Also, why the hell haven't they covered Magnum Opus by Kansas? It's like proto-prog metal."
