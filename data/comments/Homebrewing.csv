Homebrewing,3e2s8j,Mr_Hump,11,Tue Jul 21 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"From my tasting of it, I'd guess it is brewed more like Twisted Tea or Mike's Hard Lemonade. It is likely brewed from all base malt and adjuncts, with the minimum legal amount of hops. Then run through a machine that strips out the flavor/color. Then they add sugar and flavorings.  Honestly the closest you can get at home would likely be adding 10% 100 proof vodka to a keg of root beer made from a syrup.  I love the idea of a stout with root beer flavors (vanilla, wintergreen, ginger etc.), but that is a completely different idea than Not Your Father's Root Beer."
Homebrewing,3e2s8j,oldsock,6,Tue Jul 21 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.  Not your father's rootbeer is created from a flavorless liquor base, and could hardly be considered beer.  Ridiculous what they get away selling it for, even if its pretty  delicious."

When you bottle this, there is so much sugar there (which sweetens it and makes it taste like root beer) that it would create bottle bombs if not refrigerated.  Since you're kegging and keeping it cold, you should be fine.  I'd just dissolve the sugars and add to the keg."

Homebrewing,3e2s8j,Stiltzkinn,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"Search on here for the exact numbers but basically you need to hold the beer at a certain temp for a certain time.

I wouldn't ever try it again, it's not worth it.  Just keep it cold and drink it fast.  If you do try it, wear protection and be incredibly careful.  I was really lucky to not get hurt."

I followed the instructions in my kit to the letter (my mash temp was spot on like the entire time). My OG was like 1.031 (supposed to be 1.052-1.054) at 70 degrees!! Does anyone have any idea what I've done wrong? Is there any way I can fix it? The grains were supposed to be pre-crushed, the only thing I can think of is if the company did not crush them, but with two big cans of LME I don't think it would make that much of a difference!  edit: can I boil it again to decrease the water? I didnt pitch the yeast yet"
Homebrewing,3e29bo,bambam944,3,Tue Jul 21 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"Measuring OG can be tricky when brewing with extract as the extract may not have mixed well with the added water. The sample you took may have been mostly water.  If you haven't pitched the yeast yet, you can try stirring it around and mixing it up as best you can, then take another gravity sample.  Otherwise, if you're confident you used the correct amount of waters from the recipe, I would say RDWHAHB, you probably hit the expected gravity."

Homebrewing,3e29bo,NowhereAtAll,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it.  You're fine.  This happens very frequently with extract.  It tends to not mix completely and sometimes your readings will be very off.  If you're sure about your volumes and you added all the recipe ingredients, assume the OG from the kit is correct."

Looking for advice on best starting set with a bit of room to grow, but without being too intimidating... and being fairly cheap (likely under about $100 all told?).  Few considerations: I'll be brewing in AZ, where interior temp is generally between 79-85F (but, could rig a cooler or use a small bit of the shared fridge), and have fairly limited space. I'm not a huge fan of hops, but unsure whether I should start on stouts/porters/lagers/wheat/etc? Heard various pros/cons about different sizes (e.g., 1gal vs. 2-3gal vs. +), but likely looking in the 1-2.5 gal range?  Her suggestion, on the advice of a friend, was this Brooklyn kit... but don't know if there's something obviously wrong with this, if I should try building up my own slightly larger kit, or if there's a better way to start for my first few batches?  Thanks for your patience with a total newbie question!"
Homebrewing,3e29bo,chino_brews,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"That BBS kit is a one-gallon kit, and the process is an all-grain process. The Northern Brewer one-gallon kit uses an extract + steeping grains process, which is a little less involved. The NB kit also includes a mini-autosiphon (almost essential) and a bottle capper and caps (both essential), while the BBS kit does not.   The difference is like the difference in making chicken soup starting with a whole chicken, vegetables, and pasta vs. the making the same soup, but starting with chicken broth, pieces of chicken, veggies, and pasta."
Homebrewing,3e29bo,kennedon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply!  I think I'd like to do all-grain, which leads me to BBS. I guess my question is more about doing BBS vs. trying to create a BBS-like setup for 2 or 2.5 or 3 gallons. The size and price of the BBS is appealing (and many of the things like capper, caps, bottles, pots, etc could be kept if I decide to upsize later). Though, watching a friend brew with BBS, it seemed like it was hard for him to buy non-BBS ingredients in small enough sizes for 1 gallon (and, only gets about 10 bottles).  My gut is telling me to start with the BBS 1gal and move up after a few batches if I like doing it. Seem reasonable?  Also, is there any reason with a BBS to start with something other than the stout? Is there any reason to start with one of the wheats or similar for a first brew?"
Homebrewing,3e29bo,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"It's your choice, and the BBS kit is not a terrible choice. I'm not a fan because you get very little for the price. The other issue is that you end up jury-rigging a system out of two spaghetti pots and a colander, and it's messy, complicated, and inefficient. The complications in the process distract from the other technical things you need to master.  As background, when I returned to homebrewing almost three years ago, my first beer was a small-batch extract beer (that NB kit), and then I looked at the BBS stuff, a few stories on countertop mashing and small batch brewing at BYO.com by Chris Colby, and made my own 1.5 gallon all-grain setup for about $15 more: two-gallon cooler, paint strainer bag from hardware store, 2-gallon bucket. I then moved on after a few batches to a 5-gallon system from Midwest Supplies, and then quickly settled on an average 2.5 gallon batch size as being the right fit for my intake, ranging from 1 to 6 gallons.  Any, from that experience, I don't recommend AG to start unless you are into the geekery or a trained chef or scientist. You can hone skills brewing extract, and then add the additional skills you need to make good AG beer. But if you are going to go that route, I recommend starting with a BIAB system, and doing either 3-gallon or 1.25-1.50 gallon batches. If that sounds interesting, I can elaborate.  In terms of recipe, a stout would be a great first recipe. Porter is also a classic choice for the first brew."

I have been having mixed results in the kettle but consistent in the fermenter.  I did a DIPA with a 90 min boil this morning so there was a bit more wort at the beginning.  Then this happened when I put my 90 min hop addition in right after adding three eye droppers full of FermcapS in a 15 Gallon pot.  I try not to keep the propane cranked but still this happens.  WTF.
Homebrewing,3e29bo,brulosopher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"FermCap-S won't stop the eruption from adding hops from happening, that's caused by nucleation points, hence the reason it ends so quickly. This is one of the reasons I've taken to using the first wort hop (FWH) method.  Also, 3 droppers full for a 15 gallon batch is waaaaaaay overkill, I use 6 drops for 12 gallons, haven't had a boilover in years."

However, after a couple xBmts comparing ""sloppy"" yeast taken from the bottom of a carboy to fresh yeast, I'm no longer convinced it matters all that much. Regardless of your re-use method, I think the most important component is maintaining good sanitation practices. (xBmt 1, xBmt 2).

Homebrewing,3e29bo,askchucky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"I recently switched to a propane burner from my kitchen. Have a few questions for those that also brew outside.  1-The burner seems to go through propane pretty fast?  Is this true for all of them?  2-I can really control my boil now, however, when i put my chiller in with about 20mins left in the boil, it kills the boil. I crank the heat up a bit to get back to boiling, but the boil is vigorous. Is this normal?  Not sure what's going on.  3-My efficiency has dropped dramatically and my evaporation rate is way higher.  Any thoughts about this?"
Homebrewing,3e29bo,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"See prior comments about boiling too hard. Some burners are more efficient than others. My Dark Star burner seems pretty efficient in terms of BTU/hr. vs. propane use, but probably not as efficient as a KAB4/Blichmann. Build a heat shroud from sheet metal if you really want to boost your efficiency in using the heat. I crank the heat up before I put in my chiller, and I don't lose the boil. After a minute, I can reduce the heat again. The boil does not affect brewhouse efficiency, as it is impossible to boil off sugar at water boiling temps. Your evaporation maybe quite a bit higher. See those posts about overboiling again. And recalibrate your evaporation rate for your new system. Every time you change something in your system, it will change other aspects of your brew day."
Homebrewing,3e29bo,TheDarkHorse83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:12 2015 UTC,"What kind of burner did you get?  A week and a half ago I was able to do 3x 90minute boil batches, with both the BK and HLT on the same 20lb tank of propane and I still have plenty left over! If I felt like pushing the envelope a little bit, I'd brew another batch on it, but I'd rather not worry the whole time and I'll have it topped off this week.  Usually, when coming up to adding my immersion chiller into the pot, I turn the heat up a little to goose the boil from a simmer up to a good hard boil. Then I toss in the immersion chiller, let it get back to a simmer, and bring it back down again.  Efficiency can change any time that you make a change to your equipment. Look into what's going on and maybe lower your expected efficiency for the next couple of batches until you get it back to a comfortable level.  Your boil rate is higher because you have the flame turned up too high. Back it off a little and you'll save propane and beer volume."
Homebrewing,3e29bo,brulosopher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you may be boiling harder than you need to, hence the high propane usage and increased evaporation rate. All you really need is movement on the surface of the wort."

My original understanding was that this was a sanitizer, and by soaking all of my post-boil equipment for 2 minutes, I would be all set.  I've been washing with soap & water, then soaking as mentioned, and I haven't had any issues with this approach so far.  Do I need to re-vamp my process of cleaning & sanitizing?  If I'm looking for a no-rinse sanitizer, should I be purchasing something else?  As a somewhat related follow-up question:  How long can I keep my sanitizing solution?

The gas side of mine leaks a little bit, which I just haven't gotten around to trying to fix.  It's kind of a pain to futz with the lines and drop the pressure.

Alternately, you could bubble CO2 from a tank through the wort and hope that scrubs the O2 out.

You won't get rid of all the oxygen, but it'll clear most of it."

Homebrewing,3e29bo,flibbble,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"I guess the easiest way given that you have a kegging system is to put your wort in a spare keg, force carbonate it (30psi, and then shake the keg for 5 mins), purge to atmospheric pressure and then then decant back to primary. Alternatively you could sanitise some fresh gas line run that into your regulator, or disconnect the quick disconnect on your existing gas post (if you have one), sanitise the end, and use that.."
Homebrewing,3e29bo,LaMaitresse,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"Just run the line from your tank to your fermenter and open the valve. You don't need to completely eliminate all oxygen, just avoid splashing during the transfer to the fermenter and gently release some CO2 over the top. It's heavier than air, so it will sink and allow a nice protective cover for a few days until your lacto gets up and running."

Here are some things I have learned along my path from 1 keg in the fridge to 3, here goes:   Buy pin lock kegs and disconnects, they are way cheaper than ball lock kegs right now.  You can buy used ones its not big worry. Youll need a fridge or a chest freezer (in which case youll need to build a collar and a temp controller) Buy the stainless shanks and the perlicks 630ss and just get it over with, buying twice sucks. Get a 10lb bottle if you have space for it, dont want to have to be swapping with a 5lb bottle all the time.  And if you are going to swap bottles DO NOT buy a nice shiny bottle, buy one where youll be swapping.  If you can get your bottle filled go ahead and buy a nice one. There is a draft line balancer calculator out there, but I have found at 12 psi (which is what I wanted to set my regulator at) I have about 4-5' 3/16"" beer lines to get good pours. The second gauge on your regulator only tells you when youre out of CO2 (it will show you the same pressure until you are out of liquid CO2, at which point the pressure will start dropping)"

Homebrewing,3e29bo,andrewprime1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"Other than keg, CO2 and regulator you are going to need liquid side and gas side assemblies. These include (basically) a gas/liquid quick disconnect that attaches to the keg and connects to the tap/CO2 regulator with a length of tubing.   You can buy them pre-assembled, just make sure to get the same type as your keg (ball lock vs pin lock). For the liquid side. you are going to need to figure out what you want to serve your beer with. The cheapest option is called a cobra tap or a picnic tap. They are cheap plastic things, but get the job done. For a Keezer, you'll want to go a bit nicer with some actual faucet type taps, people tend to recommend Perlick SS ones.  One thing to keep in mind is the process of ""balancing"" your kegs. This is calculating how long your liquid lines need to be to serve beer at yourPressure and yourTemp. If your lines are too short and your pressure too high, you will be pouring tons of foam.   There are calculators out there, but generally I find 10' of 3/16"" tubing on the liquid side to provide a pretty good pour.  Cheers mate  [Edit] you can often find used kegs for cheaper. I went with pin lock my first time around, but I think ball locks are preferable now. Worth the small extra expense."

Homebrewing,3e29bo,chino_brews,3,Tue Jul 21 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"There's no way to get around the algebra.   I'm going to explain only brewhouse efficiency, which is: out of the amount of sugar you can theoretically get from your bill of fermentables, how much of that sugar did you actually get into the fermentor, stated as a percent.  Each grain has an extract potential (in gravity points per pound per gallon, or PPG - there are also metric equivalents, of course.) So a pound of American 2-Row Pale Malt (""2-Row"") has a potential extract of 36 PPG. Four pounds of 2-Row has a potential extract of 144 PPG (= 36 * 4).  Edit: you can look up the extract potential on the site where you buy grain, or in handy reference charts like this one. Homebrewtalk also has one on their wiki.  If I mash those four pounds of 2-Row to make a two-gallon SMaSH beer, and then end up with two gallons of 1.048 SG wort in the fermentor (or 48 gravity points), I put 96 gravity points (= 48 gravity points per gallon * 2 gallons) of sugar into the fermentor. The potential extract from 4 lbs. of 2-Row is 144 (see above). So I achieved a brewhouse efficiency of 67% (=96 / 144).  If you want to understand efficiency more, and all of the places you can lose efficiency, I suggest reading about it on the wiki at the brau kaiser site."

Go hard and try to do anything to up the efficiency, like a professional brewer would depending on style.  Or you can just add 10-15% more malt to your grain bill and be happy with that sometimes you go over and sometimes you go under.  Everything is explained in detail in homebrewing books, and I suggest you look at your manual first, then ask questions. Because your question doesn't really say what system you are using, what crush on the grains you are using, what kind of temp control you have... BIAB? A lot of things that I would want to know before I start explaining how effiency works. The best way to do it would be to follow the example calculation in how to brew though. The other things I have written about are also explained there at length."

I don't use beersmith, which I've heard can calculate efficiency, so I was wondering if there were any other reliable calculators or an easy equation for figuring it out.

(Google isn't very helpful)  As I understand it, aluminium corrosion doesn't spread like rust on iron/steel; if scratched it oxidizes and stops there. Is that correct?  (The reason I ask is I use 5L mini kegs, which are ideal for me but are often tin-plated steel which rusts easily when scratched. I've found a supplier which makes them with lacquered aluminium, which I'm hoping will alleviate the problem)"
Homebrewing,3e29bo,NewlySouthern,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:25 2015 UTC,"Thats my understanding of aluminum as well - its oxidation actually creates an impermeable ""seal"" against further oxidation, unlike oxidation such as with steel where the rusting actually promotes the formation of more rust. (related to passivation or something? I forget)  As far as laquered aluminum, It is hard to say what they use for their laquer. Since it is for kegs, its likely food-safe, but if I had to guess it is probably similar to the lining that beer cans have. My understanding is that putting beer in a plain aluminum vessel will cause it to develop a metallic taste, so the lacquer would be a barrier to prevent the beer from having direct contact with the aluminum.  I use an aluminum pot for brewing, and to avoid getting metallic flavors, I had to ""season"" the pot before use by boiling water in it for a little while to build up that oxide layer.  You probably already saw this with your googling, but this page goes a bit into the laquering. Doesn't mention much about durability though. Different manufacturers likely use different lacquers, so it would be best to contact the particular manufacturer you're looking at to ask them what they use."

If you can rule that out, the next two factors I would consider are your ingredients and technique.  Just like making a meal, the quality and freshness of your ingredients can be the different between fast food and gourmet.   I can immediately taste the difference between a extract kit put together by the local home brew store and a Mr. Beer kit that was a Christmas present from 2013.  IMHO a kits that don't include hop additions or at least some grains to steep in the wort will always have had sacrificed flavor for convenience.  In regards to technique, common mishaps that come to mind:  Burning syrup/extract on the bottom of the pot, moving/shaking the fermenter around during fermentation, letting light get to it, letting it ferment in too warm of an environment, not sanitizing the bottles, opening the fermenter before it is done.  With all that being said, I helped my father in law with a Mr Beer kit.  Relatively fresh and no big mess ups during the brewing.  Still had a 'taste' to it.  Didn't taste bad, but had a none-commercial quality about it.  I would highly recommend visiting your local home brew store.  More often than not they are very excited to help someone just starting off.  Look for an extract kit with fresh extract, maybe some specialty grains you steep in a muslin bag before the boil, and dry yeast that you can re-hydrate before pitching.

You then take dental floss and suspend them from the lid opening to the middle of the keg. The lid will still seal as the dental floss is thin enough and there's not worries of them clogging the dip tube. After your dry hop time you release the pressure and take them out.

Now I only save 3-4 12oz, or 1-2 bombers of the really good batches that I expect to repeat and compare, saving them in my aging fridge, the rest get drunken.   It's neat going back and tasting the first few batches I brewed, but they are mostly all extract and partial match, and I've found that 80% of the really good batches haven't improved with age, however almost 100% of the problem batches mellowed out a bit, losing some of the overarching problem they had."

Homebrewing,3e2xdi,Stinky_Fartface,4,Tue Jul 21 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"It depends on the color of the candi sugar. For light/clear candi sugar like you would use in a light saison, you can totally just substitute plain table sugar (granulated sugar, cane sugar, refined beet sugar, etc.) The color contribution is negligible, and yeast will readily produce invertase and invert sucrose.  However, if you are talking about darker candi sugar of the type you might use in a Belgian dubbel or BDSA, then the sugar adds flavor and color (the sugar has an almost 100% apparent degree of fermentation, but the fraction that is not fermentable has huge effect on color and flavor)."
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,chino_brews,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:01 2015 UTC,In such a case you should be using syrup though.

Homebrewing,3e2xdi,Wich3r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure I follow. Could you please explain? Do you mean because the moisture content reduces the extract (i.e., 1 kg of clear candi has less sugar than 1 kg of granulated sucrose)?"
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"So maybe this 3rd response has some details. I've never heard of these differance.  tl;dr: Invert sugar wont crystallize, so what Belgians and Americans both call Candi Sugar are different things."
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,bgrueyw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:29 2015 UTC,Syrup and sugar are not the same. The production methods and characteristics differ. I'm sure you can find more information online about it.
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,BretBeermann,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:06 2015 UTC,"You said ""In such a case you should be using syrup though."" I guess I don't understand which case you mean.   My comment had two cases: (1) in a light-colored saison recipe, I said you can substitute commodity-priced table sugar for the more expensive Belgian invert syrup aka clear/light candi syrup, and (2) I also discussed darker sugars for dubbels/BDSAs. For scenario (2), I'm not really getting into what form the sugar takes (crystals or syrup). I'd agree that the appropriate dark sugar syrup is a preferred ingredient for both dubbels/BDSAs, and for many English ales that contain Invert No. 2, 3, 4 or Brewer's Caramel."
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:57 2015 UTC,Syrup is ideal for BDSAs and similar additions rather than dark crystallized products.
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,BretBeermann,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:39 2015 UTC,"Invert sugar is a mixture of glucose and fructose, which is made by splitting sucrose. An advantage of invert sugar is that it is less prone to crystallizing, weather or not this is helpful when brewing I'm not sure. I have also read that yeast converts sucrose into glucose and fructose as part of the fermentation process, and inverting sugar reduces yeast stress. If the yeast lack the nutrients this stress could result in off flavors.  I have read that unprocessed cane sugar will have a more desirable flavor profile than refined beet sugar that is common in grocery stores. It would be interesting to do a split batch and compare. I typically spring for natural cane sugar for brewing, especially if I'm using large amounts of sugar like a tripel."

Homebrewing,3e2xdi,TheRealFender,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"I thought the traditional belgian practice was to use beet sugar to create the invert syrup. I wonder if this is due to lack of cane sugar access or because bett sugar is in some way more desirable. I prefer the taste of cane sugar in regular baking, but haven't tried beet vs cane sugar in invert form."
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,the_forestman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"I thought the traditional belgian practice was to use beet sugar to create the invert syrup.   I don't know, I can't find much details on it. Beet sugar started being produced in largish quantities in the early 1800's so its possible that more recent styles would use beet sugar.  Based on what I read, modern beet sugar is very pure, and some of the impurities in cane sugar are preferable, here is an old article that claims cane is superior to beet for baking. Does this generalize to brewing, I don't know but it offers enough evidence to suggest we should do some testing."
Homebrewing,3e2xdi,bgrueyw,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"Why not just use white table sugar?    In addition to what's already been mentioned here about yeast stress from having to produce invertase, shelf stability, etc. you should also look at the caramelization temps.  Sucrose is 320F, Glucose is 320F, but Fructose is only 230F.  If you invert the sugar, it's possible to get caramelization and Maillards at a much lower temperature than from using table sugar.  This can lead to different flavor pathways.  There's also the fact that some yeasts apparently don't express invertase, you can have gene mutations that suppress invertase secretion, or high glucose wort concentrations can suppress invertase secretion.    The flip side is if you add any product with fructose in it (table sugar or invert) in high enough quantities, you can actually tire out yeast early and they might not take up all the maltose and maltotriose.  Yeast are lazy.  Before anyone says it, if you pitch healthy yeast, you shouldn't have an issue with stalling from any of the reasons above.  This is all FYI stuff."

With the IC I can use groundwater to get it to ~85F then switch to ice water recirculated with an submersible pump to get it to pitching temp."
Homebrewing,3e3alx,oldsock,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"Well, you could also just hook up an IC to the plate chiller and the hose onto the IC, drop IC into ice water. Now you've got ice water going through the plate chiller.  That's what I'm planning to do since I've repurposed my IC coil for HERMS. I'll use the plate chiller to knock it down to ~80 and then hook up the coil to the chiller and fill the HERMS pot with cold water and ice and the hose up to the other end of the coil.  I fully anticipate having to let the first few batches warm up before pitching for ales just because I'll need to dial in that process."
Homebrewing,3e3alx,Fenix159,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"I tried that once a few years ago, but it seemed to use up the ice much faster because you are using it for the entire chilling process, rather than just the end.

Homebrewing,3e3alx,oldsock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"Oh no I definitely plan to hook it up towards the end.

Homebrewing,3e2l50,ffreire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:32 2015 UTC,Do you ferment in the same carboys/buckets you used for your 6 gallon batches?  I was thinking about scaling everything down to the smaller size so I could fit my gear in a smaller area.
Homebrewing,3e2l50,VeggieAstronomer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm using a 5gal glass carboy for this pilot batch. I've read conflicting reports here and elsewhere that the extra headspace is bad for the beer, but I'm of the opinion that the CO2 produced by fermentation will purge the headspace in due time.  Only time will tell how it turns out in the end, but, I'm excited to be brewing smaller batches and do it more often :)"
Homebrewing,3e2l50,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:08 2015 UTC,I have heard conflicting reports as well.  I think as long as you don't have a TON of headroom it shouldn't matter too much.  I may look into getting the 5 gallon big mouth bubbler (I think they make that size) just for ease of cleaning.
Homebrewing,3e2l50,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:46 2015 UTC,"Different person here, but I also do 3-3.5 gallon all grain batches. I use Beersmith to scale down recipes, it works great. For fermentation, I use a 6.5 gallon bucket and a 5 gallon Better Bottle, just because those are what I already had on hand from when I did 5 gallon extract batches. You definitely could scale down to smaller size fermentors if you wanted to, though for me it is nice to not have to worry about needing a blow-off tube!     Also, if you're looking for simplicity/less space needed for equipment, I'd definitely consider BIAB! It's great for 3 gallon batches, because it's a small enough volume that it can be boiled on a kitchen stove, and you don't need anything but a bag and a boil kettle (I use a 7.5 gallon aluminum turkey fryer, and it works great).     FWIW, Adventures in Homebrewing sells used 3 gallon pin lock kegs that are $40 each, which is much cheaper than the Cannonball system. I paid about the same amount for a two-keg setup (including the kegs, regulator, lines, manifold, and disconnects) as they charge for one."
Homebrewing,3e2l50,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the headsup on the 3 gallon kegs.  That's an awesome price.  I may still get the cannonball system since it should fit nicely in my mini fridge.  But, the 3 gallon system would be perfect down the road."
Homebrewing,3e2l50,brulosopher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"A great way to mash for 1.5 gallon batches is in a 2-gallon Rubbermaid Victory beverage cooler ($8) with a nylon paint strain bag from the hardware store inside. Use the regular spigot to lauter, and you'll need to add something in front of the spigot intake to prevent the grain bag from blocking it -- I just jam a long-handled slotted spoon between the two (the same spoon I use to stir the mash). You'll need to wrap the tun with a blanket, parka, etc. and if I do I don't t lose more than 4 degrees F over an hour. The mash converts in 30 minutes or less IME. Batch sparge.  If you want to go bigger than that, I recommend the 3-gallon Igloo Industrial cooler (yellow and red one), or even a 5-gallon cooler. At the five gallon size, you'll probably want to modify the tun, which ruins the simplicity of my small-batch method.  I'm also experimenting with 2.3 gallon BIAB in my 5-gallon starter kettle, and I like that a lot. See /u/homebrewfind's earlier reply on this post.   He has links to all of the items I cited above on his websote."
Homebrewing,3e2l50,MillionMonkeyArmy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:30 2015 UTC,Great ideas!  I like the idea of getting a cheap beverage cooler.  I'd like to get all the new gear as cheap as possible.

Homebrewing,3e0tgc,toolatealreadyfapped,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:21 2015 UTC,A great group of people gathered to judge 6 entrants. The lemon ginger saison walked away with the prize - a collection of everyone else's beer!
Homebrewing,3e0tgc,turduckenpillow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"Cool prize idea.  How did judging take place? A designated person served everyone else a sample of each, and they picked their favorite? Were they all saisons?  Tried to do an IPA competition with some friends. We invited too many people. No one really cared about the competition and everyone just drank. Still fun. We've also done a commercial pale ale bracket challenge. That was pretty fun."
Homebrewing,3e0tgc,turduckenpillow,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"Since it was small and informal, the contest was wide open. We had a couple saisons, a hefe, a maple oatmeal stout, a white IPA...  Score sheets were printed, so each person could write notes as they wanted. Again, extremely informal. Each person judged off whatever metric they chose (true to style, quality, flavor, whatever). Then each person ranked their top 3, but not allowed to vote for their own.   We will definitely do this again. And future contests might have more specific parameters. I'm pretty sure we will do one in the fall, with the category being ""Harvest seasonal.""  Which is perfect, because I've got a smoky oktoberfest lagering already."
Homebrewing,3e0tgc,turduckenpillow,2,Tue Jul 21 07:37:51 2015 UTC,Sounds like a lot of fun. I just like having the blind aspect so no one knows what they're drinking and its unbiased. Hard to do that with different styles.
Homebrewing,3e0tgc,arkangl,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:32 2015 UTC,"Oh this first setup was extremely un-blinded and potentially biased. We talked about the recipes during the judging.

Homebrewing,3e3epe,fiveohnoes,5,Tue Jul 21 17:31:15 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for PBW causing pitting in glass?
Homebrewing,3e3epe,sufferingcubsfan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm curious about this too.  I soak mine overnight.  Haven't had issues at this point.
Homebrewing,3e3epe,colonpal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"From the Better Bottle website link:     ""Manufacturers of laboratory glassware warn against soaking glassware, especially large items made of soft glass (soda lime glass), in caustic solutions.6, 7,8""    Also this from PPG on page 2   One solution pH levels reach 9.0 or greater the second important reation in the  glass corrosion process - Stage 2 - begins.  At this point, hydroxide ion concentration is sufficient to being attack of the silicate network... During the beginning phase of this reaction, microscopic pitting of the surface occurs.

Homebrewing,3e3akm,bovineblitz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:31 2015 UTC,Odds are if you pitched a healthy dose of yeast you're just fine.

Homebrewing,3e3akm,TheReverend5,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"While I'm sure your beer will still be fine, 1 vial of liquid yeast is generally an underpitch with regards to recommended pitch rates. For a five gallon batch of 1.045+ SG wort, either multiple vials or a yeast starter is usually necessary in order to get the recommended pitch rate for ales (Fix, Zainasheff, White)."
Homebrewing,3e3akm,fishwithoutbicycle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:41 2015 UTC,too late to add another vial? I pitched 1 vial about 14 hours ago. Def going to invest in yeast starter next time.
Homebrewing,3e3akm,chino_brews,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"It's probably not too late no - it won't be the end of the world if you don't add another vial either, though. If I were you, I'd probably just let it ferment as is currently, and then make starters for your future batches :)"
Homebrewing,3e3akm,mayoriguana,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:48 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  Unless its a pretty high OG beer you are probably fine with one vial.  Not ideal but still just fine.  Underpitching really badly can cause ester production you may not want... but you are doing a spiced pumpkin beer.  Odds are even in the case of a severe underpitch you'd hardly notice the esters over those pretty potent spice flavors.

Homebrewing,3e2deq,okelleher1,3,Tue Jul 21 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"If your bottles aren't carbonating, then there's a number of possabilities that you could be facing.  First, miscalculation of priming sugar/dissolved CO2. You've already ruled this out as you calculated your priming sugar value, dissolved it in boiling water, and added it to your bottling bucket to ensure that it would carbonate evenly. But there is a chance that you missed a temperature reading somewhere, though I doubt it.  Second, the bottles are being kept too cold. The general rule is that the beer should be kept at 70F for 2-3 weeks.  Third, you're dealing with a high ABV beer that might take an extended time to carb up due to the stresses of the environment. Give the bottles a little agitation to get the yeast kicked back up and wait.  Fourth, your yeast, for whatever reason, isn't surviving well in the environment that you've provided for them. Agitate the bottles and wait. If nothing happens in the weeks to come, then you might have a real problem on your hands. Since each bottle should contain the right amount of sugar, then there's no need/use adding more, what you need is a strong yeast culture. I'm currently facing this with a Belgian Tripel that's been bottled flat for a couple of months now. I'm not sure what others would recommend, but I'm considering uncapping each bottle and adding a bit of rehydrated bottle conditioning yeast (CBC-1). Hopefully that'll get it done."
Homebrewing,3e2deq,TheDarkHorse83,2,Tue Jul 21 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be rude, but there are some assumptions and missing information in your post.   I put the right volume of sugar in my entire batch of beer before bottling.    How do you know that? The optimal process is to measure the beer volume after you rack to the bottling bucket, calculate the amount of priming sugar using an online priming sugar calculator, and then measure the priming sugar by weight only (never in cups).   I am concerned that the beer is not carbonating now.    Why are you concerned? The recommended process is to hold the bottles at 70°F for three weeks and then in the fridge for at least 24 hours before you judge the carbonation level. Before then, it's OK to sample one or two, but hold your judgment on carbonation.   Should we reopen each bottle and add some sugar individually now or leave it for some time? It seems very flat.   I don't have enough information. Can you walk us through your priming process? I suspect lack of priming sugar is not your issue."
Homebrewing,3e2deq,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"How long has it been bottled, and what temperature is it being stored at."
Homebrewing,3e2deq,rxrus2,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"To build on this. It should sit at (a reasonable) room temp for at least a week to 10 days. After that, it should go in the fridge for 48 hours, as the carbonation in the head space will dissolve into your beer, completing the carbonation."
Homebrewing,3e2deq,MarshmallowBlue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:38 2015 UTC,In my experience a week is not really enough to carbonate. I would say at least 2 weeks at room temp (around 70ºF or higher).

Conditioning in general, you should allow yourself more time, but the carbonation bit should be done sooner."

Homebrewing,3e2deq,ShamrockAPD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:27 2015 UTC,"Never add more sugar, only yeast. I have some English Ales that are just starting to carbonate (still flat) after 4 weeks. I tried to add some more yeast at 4 weeks. Opened 2 of them, put a couple sprinkles in, and then when opened the third it started to foam out the mouth. After that, I realized they are just beginning to carbonate for some reason. So, I left the rest alone. In total it took 7 weeks to carb a 4.7% beer. It is out of character for yeast but does happen from time to time. I would just flip you bottles for a few day and flip them back, wait 2 more weeks. Nothing good comes from ""Fixes""."

I mean, a fresh vial going into a starter is really just a scaled down beer, right?  To add to anecdotal evidence, I re-pitch ""dirty"" slurry all the time - almost always with results that are as good, if not better, than propagating up a fresh vial.  The main benefit I usually see is a faster start and better attenuation, which probably just have to do with cell count."

Homebrewing,3dxuu8,billybraga,4,Mon Jul 20 20:52:52 2015 UTC,"Gelatin works when you cold crash the beer. It has the opposite charge of the yeast, so collagen and yeast are attracted to each other, but the cold causes the collagen molecule to fold into a helix and wrap around the yeast cells and this is typically a one-way reaction. So my concern is that yeast with collagen that is holding onto it will not be as viable as unaffceted yeast, even where you harvest the yeast from a batch and repitch into another batch at ferm temp.   /u/brulosopher says both batches were gelatin fined, so now I am curious about the harvesting process (the non-viable yeast will settle first, so if you decant the supernatent, you would be left with the suspended yeast that are not affected by the collagen)."
Homebrewing,3dxuu8,shiningPate,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"This has always been a small concern of mine, so I do the gelatin in the keg. It always works as well as Marshall's method as far as I can tell, and I have perfectly clean slurry to work with in the fermenter for next time."

Even if it contained a significant quantity of dead yeast, it seems as if a larger absolute quantity of live, reproducing yeast would be introduced, hence the quicker cover. Since your results were inconclusive, not sure it proved anything other than old yeast slurry is an economical way to get a good yeast pitch. My phd candidate molecular biologist daughter tells me a cultured yeast will fairly rapidly (4-6 weeks) converge to a set of activated genes optimized for its local environmental conditions.  It seems as though repeating this process over multiple brew batches would drive your yeast culture toward a local, characteristic flavor rather than the flavor of a known cultured strain."

First, I used Millennium and Falconer’s Flight hops (and some Columbus hops), along with three varieties of rye: rye malt, flaked rye, and crystal rye. Secondly, two of my fellow NYC homebrewers brewed a double IPA with the same hops and no rye; that beer was so impressive that I had to brew my own version of their recipe. In addition to this beer’s recipe being new and my own, this brew day served as the first test of my new 10 gallon brew kettle from The Brewed Palate’s newest sponsor Ss Brewing Technologies (BrewTech). A full overview/review video of the kettle itself will be uploaded ASAP that’ll include my full opinion on how the kettle performed during its “maiden voyage”.

Just yesterday, I finished lautering wort into two kettles around 3 pm, cleaned my mash tun, and then left for a few hours, and then started my (three-hour) boil around 9 pm, wrapping up at 1:30 am.  Sometimes I heat strike water during dinner, mash in after dinner, and then pause my brew day for 2-3 hours. Or mash-in before bed, lauter in the morning, and then do the boil after work.  The only key is to heat the wort to 185°F (or just under boiling) before covering and letting it sit for 12 hours. It's probably not necessary, but I feel better about semi-pasteurizing the wort. I haven't had any mash or wort go sour yet."

It took just over 2.5 weeks grain to glass and turned out amazing. The sours you're referring to are very hard to make and often involve blends of differently aged beers. Gose and Berlinerweiss in my opinion are a good place to start. I used information and a recipe from an article that was in BYO (I'll link it if I can in an edit) a few months back. Short version: I started the mash on a Friday afternoon, chilled with 10 lbs ice, sprinkled crushed acidulated malt on top, topped with a blanket of CO2, put the lid on and used a fermwrap on the side of the pot to keep it warm overnight (the fermwrap managed to keep it at right around 100 degrees). The instructions said to check the pH every 12 hrs until it was in the 4-4.5 range. I let it go around 15 hours and when I checked the pH with the strips I had available, it indicated that it was around 3.0. I thought I screwed it up, but it smelled and tasted ok, so I went ahead and finished it that morning. I pitched a 1L starter of WLP029 Kölsh and it fermented out in 8 days at 68. I don't currently have my notes with me otherwise I'd go into more detail, but it turned out much better than I expected being my first ""sour"".

Wyeast has their Roesalare blend as well as the Belgian Lambic blend. White Labs also offers a few blends. Those blends are a pitch and forget type deal. No starters, no propagating from dregs, and are blended with specific proportions of each microb to give you the flavor and aroma profile of some of the great Belgian sours being produced.

Add apple juice and yeast together into a sanitized fermenter, pop on an airlock and wait.  Of course you can do other things to impart more/different flavor, but this is the gist of it."
Homebrewing,3dzyew,tallboybrews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"Cider can be beginner or intermediate depending on what type of cider you want to make. Juicing your own apples it the way-to-go if you are keeping some of the sugars and flavors via pasteurization. This is the process, and can be a bit a scary first time around.  The beginner cider method is just letting the yeast go all the way down. Cider will ferment down to 1.00-0.96 producing a dry cider or poor man's champagne, as I like to call it (nothing wrong with it, this is my favorite type of cider). If you go this route, I would not invest all the money and time in your own apples, as most of the flavors will be eaten up. Just buy 100% apple juice with no preservatives."

I usually just buy some apple juice for the store,  mix it together with some yeast nutrients and some saison yeast.  In about two weeks I have some dry hard cider,  I keg so back sweetening is easy and safe.  If you bottle you can easily have one of the following: dry,  flat cider,  dry carbonated cider,  or sweet flat cider.    Swee. carbonaTed cider requires either kegging or bottle pasturiezation.  This is risky business as you're basically walking the fair fine line between having it be slightly carbonated,  then pasteurizing and having it be too carbonated and the bottle exploding."

Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:36 2015 UTC,"Over the past year, every beer I've brewed except for 2 ESBs have been lagers, most of which were decoction mashed. I did re-brew a few recipes using step mashes and infusion mashes. A few things I observed:   Decoction mashing reliably increased my mash efficiency from about 78% to 83%. Decoction mashing did darken the color of the wort, but only when the decoctions were boiled intensely for a long time - at least 30 minutes or so. My step mashed beers were noticeably very different from my single infusion mashed beers. The step mashed beers reliably had better clarity with less chill haze, more body, better foam stability, and a more robust malt flavor and aroma. These were mostly beers made with a base of Weyermann or Best pils malt + varying degrees of munich and vienna, following a mash schedule of 15-20 minutes at 131 F, 30 minutes at 145-146 F, and 45-60 minutes at 158-160 F. None of these beers had any carapils in them, so I'm hesitant to say that the single infusion beers couldn't be given the same level of body and foam with a little carapils. In the cases that the decoctions weren't boiled long enough to darken in color (e.g. boiled 10-20 minutes for lighter beers), I couldn't tell a difference between the decoction mashed beers and the step mashed beers."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,KidMoxie,5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:09 2015 UTC,While decoction mashing absolutely makes a noticeable impact to your beer in terms of both flavor and color   Denny Conn's experiment disagrees.  As does the report generated as part of an experiement for the AHA Research and Education Fund.
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,6,Mon Jul 20 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"FWIW, in my opinion that AHA report on decoction was, uh, lacking in rigor. Someone wrote in to Zymurgy saying that some goofs in the process kinda invalidated the results and one of the editors flipped out. I'd really love to see it attempted again, but that seems unlikely."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,Uberg33k,4,Mon Jul 20 17:54:50 2015 UTC,I completely agree. When I first read the report I was disappointed that it wasn't as rigorous as it could be.  I remember that letter to the editor too. The letter was quite strongly worded IIRC. In the end I think I disagreed with both the letter and the response.
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,4,Mon Jul 20 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Denny never mentions what recipe he used to test his hypothesis.  The AHA REF write up admits they flubbed up their decoctions a bit and were using fully modified malt in their experiment.    The more I do decoctions and taste other people's brews, the more I'm coming around to the idea it doesn't matter unless you have access to some fairly undermodified malts.  You'll be able to unlock flavor that you just can't get from fully modified malts.  So, unless your LHBS has Moravian floor malt, chit malt, or maybe Bo-Pils floor malt (it's on the edge), then there won't be much of a difference in the end product.  I haven't done enough with unmalted grains (like a Wit grain bill) to know if it'll work with that as well.  When you do have access to the right kind of malt, the taste is pretty easy to pick out (IMO).  Some people can't seem to distinguish it even then, which is baffling to me.  I can only guess that maybe it's like the thing some people have with cilantro or asparagus."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,Uberg33k,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:05 2015 UTC,Denny's decoction info is here and in the slides. It's an aggregate.  Maybe with undermodified malt or unmalted wheat it would be different. I really don't know. I've not seen any side by side tests or anything on that.  Where can you source some of these malts?
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"Weyermann Floor Malted Bo-Pils is everywhere, but I get mine from Rebel Brewer.  Castle makes a chit malt and a flaked chit malt.  You should be able to get that from any LHBS that carries Castle malt.  Real Moravian malt is a trick though.  I know a brew pub around here somehow sources a few sacks of some malt from Prostejov for a pilsner and it was amazing.  The stuff was pretty undermodified.  Never got the brewer to tell me where it came from.  I think the only way you'll ever get malt that undermodified is either making it  yourself or flying to Prague and buying a few sacks."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,BretBeermann,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"I've got a sack of Floor Malted Bo Pils, but I'm not going to go to the trouble of decocting unless I have the optimum chances of getting a result.

I doubt there are many, if any, breweries doing decoction simply for tradition. Probably most of them are still doing it in their newest brewhouses because they can't afford to chance it on a new system that doesn't support decoction and then do their taste panel and it turn out that the beers are not the same.

Like you've mentioned, it could also be a ""difference between great beer and good beer"" sort of thing. Maybe decoction makes something barely perceptible? Or maybe nothing at all. I'm trying to outline an experiment right now, though I have tried both methods and really enjoyed both beers.    downvote all my posts in this thread   Well...I know Gary loves decoction...

Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm all for exploring data.  Really, though, don't you need to make three beers to really test this?  One decocted, one with melanoiden, one with neither?"
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm thinking. The main problem in exploring it is that this means I need to do three separate mashes, and at the end of the experiment any difference/indifference could be attributed to some possible flaw between the batches.   I'd like to think my system is really dialed in, and sure it would be easier with an electronic setup, but eh. Something to consider."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,nzo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you, but I am absolutely for more thorough testing.  More data is never a bad thing."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"Denny's experiment uses a single mash, and says ""may not"", not ""is not"".  Surely you are not claiming that melanoiden production is not a real thing?  You can see the color changes as you go.    I fully allow that the use of specialty malts (i.e. melanoiden malt) are likely equivalent.  I've heard Marshall (and many others) say as much, and I figure that eventually, there will be an exBEERiment showing that a little melanoiden malt makes the beers basically equivalent.  But to claim that the process does nothing seems a little off base to me."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,3,Mon Jul 20 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"Denny's experiment uses a single mash, and says ""may not"", not ""is not"".   No...Denny aggregated data from many different brewers.   Surely you are not claiming that melanoiden production is not a real thing? You can see the color changes as you go.    Can you? If that's the case, how can pilsners brewed with traditional decoctions be so light? In fact, just as light as my single infusion pilsners. Perhaps scorching is more to blame for the color change?   But to claim that the process does nothing seems a little off base to me.   But why? I provided evidence from experiments that indicates that it is at best inconclusive that decoction does anything at all. You made multiple absolute statements of fact that decoction [is awesome] in your article with not experimental data to back it up. My claim seems more reasonable, especially considering that my claim is simply ""Decoctions may not do anything at all.""  Which brings me to my last point, that melanoidin malt may not even be necessary to ""mimic"" decoction, because decoction likely doesn't do anything."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,rayfound,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that you are correct, but I haven't done a side by side experiment, so I can't personally prove it.  I have done the same recipe with and without, and feel there is a noticeable difference - but that could be confirmation bias.  That said there is a trove of resources that go into the hows of decoction mashing, how the grain walls are destroyed (thus releasing starches), how melanoidens are formed, etc.   I did touch on the efficiency point in my article - I have yet to overshoot my target gravity by less than four points when decocting.  Chalk it up to anecdotal evidence, but it's my experience; I feel that indicates that the ""starch freeing claim"" made by people with great reputations (i.e. Kai Troester, who I reference) has some validity to it.  As for the color, you do know that pilsners and such have very short decoction boils, right?  Did you see the pictures in my post?  The second photo shows a noticeable darkening when compared to the first (and it got noticeably darker after that).  Add the decoction back to the main mash, it all darkens.     Perhaps scorching is more to blame for the color change?   I've scorched a decoction before.  It's not pretty.  The pictures I include were not scorched."
Homebrewing,3dyc6d,testingapril,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"The color difference could easily be explained as a function of colorants dissolving more readily at higher temperatures. This is referenced repeatedly in extract brewing literature about steeping at 170F to maximize color extraction. Also, just because you aren't scorching doesn't mean you aren't caramelizing, which again, shouldn't be happening in a decoction.    As for the color, you do know that pilsners and such have very short decoction boils, right?   Are you saying this to try to indicate that decoction might not produce much color change? If that's the case, then you are confirming my original contention with the article that decoction does not ""absolutely make a noticeable impact to your beer in terms of both flavor and color""  You seem to be making the claim that ""stuff happens in a decoction"" and that means ""it must make a difference"" and that simply isn't true. That's circular reasoning, and it's a result of confirmation bias. You're doing work, and expecting results.  You obviously love decoction, and I encourage you to keep doing them if it brings you joy. Just keep in mind that it's possible that it doesn't make any tangible difference in the end product."

If I boil grain for thirty minutes, it's going to darken even if I stir constantly.  Come on, man.   Are you saying this to try to indicate that decoction might not produce much color change?   No, I'm saying that a shorter boil causes less color change (and, presumably, less flavor contribution) than does a longer boil.  I apologize for any possible miscommunication on my part.   You seem to be making the claim that ""stuff happens in a decoction"" and that means ""it must make a difference"" and that simply isn't true.   So, measurable changes don't make a difference.  is that what you're saying?  I've admitted that I haven't done a side by side decoct vs. non decoct batch, and I'm admitting that flavor differences could be bias.  But color is pretty measurable.   Incidentally, melanoiden production is a pretty well documented phenomenon.  I'm not sure why I'm being asked to prove its existence to you in my article.  All that aside...  Seriously, man.

Homebrewing,3dyc6d,jableshables,2,Mon Jul 20 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed, this is one of those nigh-religious debates in homebrewing. Some brewers will tell you that there just is no point in employing a decoction, that you can achieve an identical beer with a little melanoiden malt. Others hold that there is something special in a decocted beer, some little touch of magic that you just can't perfectly duplicate in any other way.   It probably comes as no surprise that I fall into the latter camp. Understand, I love melanoiden malt; I feel like it can add a lot to almost any beer where maltiness is desired. However, I also believe that decoction does something that you just cannot exactly replicate with any mere specialty malt. That being said, the purpose of this article (tongue in cheek title aside) is not to try to convince you either way; rather, my intention is to simply walk you through the process of a decoction mash, if you are so inclined to perform one.   This is exactly what my post claims."

Homebrewing,3e0eqx,kanno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:31:24 2015 UTC,Different LxWxH dimensions as well. The one at Best Buy seems bigger based on the specs. Unfortunately I live in a city without a vehicle. The lower price at Best Buy is offset by the cost of delivery. Walmart has free shipping.  I'm hoping to fit 3 cronys into the freezer. Any clue if the FRF454 at Walmart will be able to pull that off?

No statistically meaningful difference in triangle tests between shaken wort and wort babied to avoid introducing any oxygen. The discussion is in the sub that day.

Homebrewing,3dxq8y,KFBass,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"Right. So yeah dry yeast manufacturer state that most of the time properly rehydrated dry yeast does not need aeration. They have all that good stuff, as long as you pitch the right amount. Yeast need oxygen, and that is a scientific fact. Olive oil trials aside."
Homebrewing,3dxq8y,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:04 2015 UTC,"LOL. The think idea with the dry yeast is that you need less growth because you'e starting with at least 600B cells, and the cells you do get start out well-aerated in the same way cells off a traditional stirred starter are well-aerated -- the bioreactors in which they grow up the to-be-dried yeast end with the step where yeast are supplied O2 and they stockpile as much as they can, and then the yeast are dried before they actually use that O2 for cell wall/membrane synthesis. So it's like the difference between pitching x cells that just came off a nutrient-fed, aerated stir plate culture vs. the same number of cells sitting at the bottom of a spent yeast cake."

Homebrewing,3dxmoe,oldsock,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:09 2015 UTC,How do you like it so far? Tbh - it's one of my top reads so far..
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,oldsock,2,Mon Jul 20 13:17:09 2015 UTC,"I just read the intro and then a few recipes while I was jotting down ideas for what to brew the rest of the year.  I'm always hyper-critical of brewing books, because no one does things quite like I would. For example, I would have standardized the batch sizes to make flipping through it easier (no problem with leaving different efficiencies and sparging techniques etc.). I'll also say that most of the recipes aren't how I'd write them. Not having brewed them, but some seem overly complex e.g., the beer inspired by Hoegaarden Grand Cru with 11 malts, while others seem lacking (the Mosaic DIPA with no dry hops). We all have different tastes (so glad he included tasting notes), I've often been disappointed several times brewing ""popular"" recipes that don't look right to me.  Nitpicking aside, it seems like it is going to be a great book for gaining insight into his recipe development. Should be inspirational as well, it is easy to get stuck in a rut with the way you write recipes. Just nice to see a homebrew-centric book from Brewer's Publications, most of them are leaning more and more towards professional needs. Just finished Malt, and didn't feel like I took away much I could actually apply.  Gordon lives in the same Dayton suburb that my wife is from; at some point I'll have to stop by and try a few of his beers for myself!"
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,KidMoxie,3,Mon Jul 20 13:39:16 2015 UTC,"Strong knows his biz, I read his stuff for his insights on process and technique more than anything. Like you mention, I know my setup and recipe preferences more than anyone, so the recipes themselves are just good fodder for helping me think up new ideas.  Interestingly, I found Mosher's Mastering Homebrew had a more informative/grokable section on malt than the Malt book did :P"
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,BeerDerp,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:55 2015 UTC,"Great points.  I thought MHR was a great book overall, but also found myself disagreeing with many of his (s recipe formulations, and frustrated with some gaps and inconsistencies (not always specifying the maltster or lovibond for certain specialty malts, neglecting to mention anything about carbonation levels, etc).  However, Gordon's techniques and general approach to brewing are awesome, and it's just great to get some insight into arguably the most successful homebrewer of our time.  That being said - for me at least, the book is no Brewing Classic Styles.  BCS will remain my go-to recipe book for homebrew competition style-based brewing, and although I find myself brewing Jamil's recipes to the T far less often, most are at least excellent starting points."
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,thebottlefarm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"As a point of note, how many IPA / Hoppy Pale NHC medals does he have? I know he's won 3 Ninkasi's, which is impressive, but that might not be his area of expertise."
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,oldsock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:36 2015 UTC,I just noted it as odd because many of the other hoppy beers do have dry hops.
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,thebottlefarm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"It was more of a question of his hoppy style, I think he's publicly stated he doesn't really like dry hop flavor that much. So, it would reason that he'd avoid it."
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,oldsock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, but to my palate I can't imagine 6 oz of hops (1 each at FWH, 15, 10, 5, 0, and 10 post-flame-out) for 6.5 gallons of 8.4% ABV beer would be enough to give it the nose I want in a DIPA."
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,thebottlefarm,2,Tue Jul 21 01:39:34 2015 UTC,"I think we are in agreement, I don't think he brews hoppy beers like I do. I'm not saying I wouldn't enjoy his, but, I put 90g dry hop in a 2.5 gal batch, so I'm not shy about it. :)"

What book would you recommend, that gives the best practical advices beside How to brew, and the rest of beginners book?"
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,UnsungSavior16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:50 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying the book so far as well, though I've heard that Brewing Better Beer is a must read and that you should read BBB over this book. I'm enjoying his approach to recipe design, but wish it went a bit more into the technical aspects of why he did what he did.   For example, I know the whole ""Adding roasted grains at vorlauf"" technique takes care of the difficult to manage mash pH w/roasted grains, but do we adjust for kettle pH? Stuff like that."
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,oldsock,2,Mon Jul 20 13:39:39 2015 UTC,Brewing Better Beer is the book that will answer those sorts of questions on his process (IIRC he doesn't treat the boil pH - which is what bothers me about the late-additions to the mash).
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,CentralCalBrewer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Maybe that's what I find lacking in this procedure. We have a brewer or two locally that use his method and I have to say, those beers are never good. They are just... lackluster..."
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,fantasticmrfox23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:11 2015 UTC,I've not thought about the boil ph. I just brewed his American Amber Recipe exactly as is. I really wanted to try the process of mashing only the base malts in DI water and adding the grains @ vorlauf. It's been in the fermentor for just about 10 days and I'm about to dry hop soon. Hopefully it will turn out good.
Homebrewing,3dxmoe,TheReverend5,0,Tue Jul 21 00:59:16 2015 UTC,That's a good point.  But Ive been a little bit lazy on the pH front as of late - I've been using 5.2 stabiliser..

Homebrewing,3dy15c,Jon_TWR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:39 2015 UTC,But why don't you just use a gas disconnect and tubing as a blowoff tube?
Homebrewing,3dy15c,OrangeCurtain,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"$5 or $10 for a lid that does the trick or a length of tubing and a tub of liquid sitting around?  I have just opted for the former.  I spill everything, always.  My wife, literally moves my glass away from the edge of the table, like you would with a child.  :)  I've never used a blowoff tube for any of my fermenters.  It's a great, cheap solution and a lot of people do it with a lot of vessels.  I'm not slighting the technique, I just don't do it myself."

Homebrewing,3e10mu,kalvaroo,2,Tue Jul 21 04:05:03 2015 UTC,"To up the CO2 dissolved in beer you can decrease temperature, increase pressure, or some combination of the two. If you increase pressure you will need to rebalance your keg lines to avoid the unfortunate fast foamy pours. Under both circumstances, the CO2 needs time to dissolve into the beer."
Homebrewing,3e10mu,jangevaa,2,Tue Jul 21 04:11:40 2015 UTC,Do you hand wash your glasses? Most dish soap will leave a film that destroys foam. Rinse with hot water or Dishwasher only.
Homebrewing,3e10mu,bendalevlogs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:29:17 2015 UTC,I do! this sounds like a good experiment. Thanks for the tip
Homebrewing,3e10mu,TheReverend5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:50 2015 UTC,"So I used to believe this, but I've started using unscented dish soap more often now and I haven't seen any issue with my head retention as long as I thoroughly rinse with hot water. I've found dish soap alone is much more effective than star-San alone (go figure), and about as effective as PBW in terms of making my glasses ""beer clean.""    I also don't see why dishwasher soap would be any better than dish soap - why do you think so?"
Homebrewing,3e10mu,bendalevlogs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:11 2015 UTC,"It's all about which chemicals are used in the soap. Not all liquid dish soaps will be a problem and if you rinse your glasses thoroughly you should be fine. I did I simple blinded test last summer and found I could pick the hand washed glass about 70% of the time, just from the head retention."
Homebrewing,3e10mu,YouCantDestabilise,2,Tue Jul 21 13:39:00 2015 UTC,Does it taste carbonated? You are using the set it and forget it method for carbonating. It my take long than two days for it to reach fully carbed. I tend to use this method.
Homebrewing,3e10mu,YouCantDestabilise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:54 2015 UTC,How are you carbonating your beer?
Homebrewing,3e10mu,afr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:53:36 2015 UTC,"I put it in the keg and leave it attached to CO2 at about 12 psi for a couple of days. It always pours fine, but i never see the continuous bubbles floating from the bottom of the glass."
Homebrewing,3e10mu,Broham13,3,Tue Jul 21 06:06:31 2015 UTC,A few days at 12 psi isn't long enough to get full carbonation.  Wait about 2 weeks.

Today you get to learn that it is in fact perfectly fine to squeeze the shit out of your grain bag.  Unless you're superman, you won't be extracting anything bad.   but is there any harm in squeezing the hop bag?   Similarly, there is no real negative to squeezing the hop bag either. Aside from it being hot and perhaps squeezing more hop matter out, which may or may not be desirable depending on what you're goin for anyway."
Homebrewing,3dym16,Fenix159,5,Mon Jul 20 16:44:36 2015 UTC,I thought squeezing the grain bag was fine as long as your pH was below 6 and temp was below... er.. 170? Not sure on the temp.
Homebrewing,3dym16,kanno,4,Mon Jul 20 16:39:10 2015 UTC,Tannin extraction from the grist is much more a factor of pH than anything else.  Squeeze away.
Homebrewing,3dym16,NowhereAtAll,3,Mon Jul 20 16:43:30 2015 UTC,I dont squeeze the hop bag purely because it just puts green goop in the wort.

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,cornystool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"So I'm planning on brewing a bunch of beer for a wedding that takes place ~April next year. I know the alpha acids diminish over time, so I should brew hoppy beers last.   If I force carbonate, how long will the beer typically last? How long will beer last in a keg if left unrefrigerated?   Unrelated question:   How do you guys cold crash and prevent water/sanitizer/oxygen from airlock/blowoff from getting into the beer?"
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,flexyourhead_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"A small amount of sanitizer isn't going to give you any problems. If you have your blowoff in a pint of sanitizer, it may be an issue. By the time you're ready to cold crash, you can switch to an airlock. Just check if often to see if it needs to be refilled. Cover it with foil as well.  The carbonation should last a long, long time as long as you have a good seal. There really isn't anywhere for it to go unless it's not fully absorbed. By that I mean, if you only lightly carbonate the beer and have a lot of head space, the carbonation will release into the headspace (and equalize). If you have equal pressure in the headspace and beer, it should stay carbonated indefinitely. I hope that makes sense."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,gibolas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:54 2015 UTC,I crash in kegs. You can pressurize the keg slightly to prevent a vacuum when it cools.
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,PTCBeerGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's a really dumb question that has been bothering me.  When a recipe specifies a ""batch size,"" Should that be the final amount of beer packaged, wort into the fermentor, post boil volume, or pre-boil volume.  I'm reasonably sure it isn't pre-boil, but loss occurs there as well a little when going from kettle to fermentor, and again from fermentor to package.  Just a little detail that has irked me."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"It totally depends.   When you buy a kit, batch size typically refers to post-boil volume in the kettle. You can figure this out by dividing the gravity points pf extract in the recipe by the batch size and comparing it to the stated OG.  When you find a recipe online, it usually means volume in the fermentor at a minimum, but possibly packaged volume. But you usually have no idea the sorts of losses the recipe designer plans on suffering along the way, unless you have the BeerXML or Beersmith file. Again, you can do some back-of-napkin math with the potential extract and gravity, to extrapolate the post-boil volume and see how that compares to batch size."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,CentralCalBrewer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"Typically it referring to what goes into your fermentor. For instance, if you setup beersmith correctly, it will take into account Mashtun deadspace, kettle deadspace, loss to grain and boil off so that a 6G recipe is expecting 6G to make it into the fermentor."

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,CentralCalBrewer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:16 2015 UTC,Yeah - that's why I usually shoot for a 5.5G batch INTO the fermentor so that I can get as close to 5G into the keg.
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,bluelinebrewing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"Typically, it's into the fermentor.  So, for instance, I brew 5.5 gallon batches, in that I fill my carboy to the 5.5 gallon mark.  There's usually nearly 6 gallons in the kettle after the boil, and 7-7.5 preboil.  Then, when I go to keg, I get about 5 gallons in the keg."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,solarchaos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:06 2015 UTC,Just curious if anyone's ever tried stacking fermenters vertically?  I have a closet I use for fermenting and I was just thinking if I bought new buckets and drilled airlock holes in the side near the top maybe I could have them stacked vertically...    Anyone see any big problems with this idea?
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"You can definitely stack buckets filled with wort up[ to two high -- I did that once. Also, you can see HDPE buckets stored higher (maybe four or five high) in warehouses.  The drilling of airlocks on the side seems weird. Would you give the stem a 90° bend, or use blowoff tubes?  Something I just came up with is to cut a cheap bucket into 4-6"" cross sections, drill a hole in the side of that, and then use it as a spacer between buckets, with a blowoff tube on the lower buckets threaded through the hole in the spacer ring. ""Homer"" buckets are US$2.97 at Home Depot."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,OrangeCurtain,2,Mon Jul 20 16:31:44 2015 UTC,"Cutting a bucket would seem to weaken the structure, since buckets have those reinforcement rings around the top to maintain the shape.

It looked clear in the bottle, as I could hold the bottle up and see my fingers on the other side, but after I poured, it was hazy and I couldn't see through it.  Worst of all, there was that sweet, butterscotch flavor.  Not a butterscotch bomb, but enough to let you know it's there.  I'm not sure how I got it there, too.    During fermentation, the first week was spent at 68F.  A few days after that week was spent at 72F for what I thought was a diacetyl rest.  After that was a few days at 38F cold crash and then I bottled.  Bottling day went as usual with sanitizing all the equipment and my bottling bucket, autosiphoned the beer from the primary to bottling bucket, and then used my autosiphon-tube-bottling wand to bottle.  The bottles have been in my garage ever since and it's been warm in there as it's been between 90F-100F around these here.    Any ideas as to what could have caused the goddamn diacetyl?"
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,3,Mon Jul 20 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"The two most common causes of diacetyl are fermentation by products from your primary pitch and contamination (especially by Pediococcus). It seems like you did a d-rest after adequate time/tep for attenuation, so primary strain-derived diacetyl seems less likely.  Probably the third most common cause is that some people are sensitive to caramel flavor, and perceive it like butter/butterscotch. So you can consider whether you used caramel/crystal malts, old extract, or allowed scorching in your kettle.  Finally, the fact that the beer is sweet (if that is true sweetness rather than perception of sweetness) should be concerning, and this could just be unfermented extract.  Anyway, it's impossible to diagnose over this sub, but those are some possibilities. I hope that helps."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,ThrowawayHomebrewer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Question.  Something that's just come up to me right now.  I've heard that cold crashed beer can take longer to carb up due to yeast settling out during the crash.  Since this was a cold crashed beer, could the sweetness be due to the dextrose not having been eaten up by the yeast yet?"
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is true. I literally froze a beer that had already been gelatin fined and cold crashed for 4 months. I bottled 16 oz. in a PET bottle, re-yeasted the rest of the batch, bottled a second 16 oz. in a PET bottle, and then bottled the rest of the batch. The re-yeasted batch carbed up faster, but the bottle of the non-reyeasted batch was pretty firm after two weeks, and was done within the standard three weeks."

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,ragout,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe you poured too vigorously, knocking up the yeasts from the bottom, try pouring slowly without stopping halfway.

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,ThrowawayHomebrewer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I did pour vigourously.  I started pouring down the side and when I noticed no carbonation, I went straight down the middle instead.  I forgot that it takes a while for cold crashed beers to become fully carbed.   I prepared a 1.5L starter of WLP001.  God, I hope that was enough...  I guess I will have to wait it out and see if it carbs up more and if the diacetyl dies away."

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,ntopliffe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:08 2015 UTC,What's the difference between mashing and steeping? When do you steep? Why do you steep? With what do you steep?
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,4,Mon Jul 20 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"Mashing is to mix grains that contain diastatic enzymes with hot water, usually but not always in the 140-160°F range, and to hold the ""mash"" at that temperature or a series of temperature steps (""rests"") that favor the enzymes, so the enzymes will convert starch to fermentable and unfermentable sugars. Base malts have abundant diastatic enzymes and most steeping grains have little to no diastatic enzymes.  Steeping is to steep grains -- usually specialty grains -- in hot water to extract aroma, flavor, and color. Specialty grains are good for steeping because they have either been ""mashed"" in the kernel, in the case of cystal/caramel malts, or are roasted very dark so that they contain little starch. On the other hand, base malts and certain ""toasted"" malts like Victory Malt, should not be merely steeped, and should be mashed, because they will add a bunch of unfermentable starch to your wort if you try to steep them.  You generally steep specialty grains before starting your boil, but its possible to steep (in cold water) overnight before the brew day or concurrently with the boil.  BTW, your snoo says you are an advanced brewer, so I am surprised you are not familiar with this very basic info. I assume you picked that snoo by accident.  Edit: typos"
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,KanpaiWashi,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:58 2015 UTC,"I think mashing grains is moreso for extracting the sugars out of the grains, whereas steeping grains is only used for getting body and flavor out of the grains.  Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that.  Steeping is usually done before adding in the LME/DME.  So far, I've steeped with roasted barley, chocolate malts, and crystal malt."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,ntopliffe,2,Mon Jul 20 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"Steeping is usually done before adding in the LME/DME   but after the mash, correct?   Do you use a biab type bag and put the steeping grains in before the boil? What temperature do you steep at? How long do you steep for typically?"
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,ragout,3,Mon Jul 20 15:07:55 2015 UTC,Read this! Pretty much covers the steeping process:  http://www.howtobrew.com/section2/chapter13.html
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,KanpaiWashi,2,Mon Jul 20 15:52:31 2015 UTC,"If you're mashing (assuming you're doing BIAB, all-grain, partial mash), there's really no need to steep.    With steeping grains, you generally use muslin bags and you do it before you the boil.  You heat your water to about 150F-170F, no higher than that, turn off your burner, and let it steep for about 20-30 minutes.  After that time has passed, you take the bag of grains out, mix in your extract, and then start your 60 minute boil."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,ntopliffe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"I have a 10 gal mash tun with false bottom, then I transfer to the boil pot and sparge about a gallon and a half to get up to about 6 gallons pre boil.

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,bluelinebrewing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:46 2015 UTC,"It's not typically necessary.  Some people do advocate steeping (even cold-steeping) roasted malts to extract a smoother flavor out of them, or so they don't bring down the mash pH as much.  That's more of a preference thing, though."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,KanpaiWashi,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're doing all-grain, so you wouldn't have to steep at all.    Steeping, you're only getting flavor/body/color out of the grains.  Mashing, you're aiming to get all of that, but more importantly, you're aiming to get the amylase enzymes to convert their starches into fermentable sugars.  That's the difference."

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,beericane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:28 2015 UTC,Like Death just described.   First runnings is the first amount of wort you pull from your mash tun that has a TON of sugar dissolved in it.   The second runnings is when you add more water to rinse off any sugar left behind on the grains that you didn't get on the first go.
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,DeathtoPants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"With a Batch Sparge, you drain the mash tun and then add new hot sparge water, leave it for a while, then repeat. The first running is the wort you get on the initial draining. It's significantly thicker than the following ones. The second running would be the one you get with the first round of sparge water, and so on.   Usually you just blend the runnings together before the boil, but sometimes you can do a parti-gyle, meaning 2 or more different beers from the same mash. For instace, say I mash for an IIPA, and first runnings hit (pre-boil) gravity of 1.090. I boil this without waiting for more wort. The second runnings hit 1.035, and I use that separately to make a Pale Ale.  I'm not sure if it can apply to Fly Sparge, seeing as it's continuous."

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,Chexjc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Very different, though it can give you an idea of what the finished product may taste like. For that reason, most people add flavorings after fermentation or in the bottling bucket."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,NuclearSky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:47 2015 UTC,Are there flavours that work best when added after fermentation?
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,bluelinebrewing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Anything with volatile aromatics is going to be better after fermentation, because the CO2 from fermentation is going to drive off a lot of it.

My concern is when transferring the beer to secondary for dry hopping and cold crashing or even to kegs. Any hints on keeping the beer covered while using an auto-siphon from a bucket? Any general tips on dealing with fruit flies? I'm using a bleach soak and a star san soak on the fermenters, replacing all vinyl, soaking auto siphon."

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,rayban_yoda,2,Mon Jul 20 13:14:06 2015 UTC,"The beer will begin to settle and become less cloudy, especially at room temperature. As you chill you may encounter some chill haze. Most would agree this is purely cosmetic and will not effect taste.   As far as the SRM (color of your beer) it is pretty much locked in, it may lighten up a bit when aged. Don't expect it to go from bright orange to straw pale or anything drastic.   As far as aging, Pale Ale is a beer that is best enjoyed fresher. Enjoy your Bright Orange Pale Ale in a couple of weeks!   It will probably taste it's best around the 1-2 month mark from bottling.

Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"What kind of cranberry flavoring?  I've been brewing with cranberries, added in the fermentor after primary fermentation is done. I freeze them, defrost them, freeze them again, and finally defrost them for addition. I've let the fruit sit on top, but a better practice is to weight them down in a mesh bag to avoid mold potential.  So far, cranberry has been great in a milk stout and a Belgian blonde. I feel like it would work really well in any beer with a lot of wheat, too."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,NuclearSky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"Fresh cranberries are not exactly easy to get for me, so I was wondering more about whether dried or syrup (maybe) would work."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"Dried cranberries (""craisins"") are usually doused in sugar, so that may not be something you want to add to beer. You can sometimes get unadulterated dry cranberries in the bulk foods section of health food stores.  As far as syrup, I have no idea. But another option to consider is to use canned cranberries (again check for added sugar) and then deal with the pectin haze caused by heating the fruit in the canning process with pectinase (aka pectic enzyme at the LHBS).  Honestly, cranberries are high in phenols and pectin, and one of the things I do as a practice is used pectinase in the fermentor. I haven't tried adding it to the fruit in advance of adding the fruit."
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,NuclearSky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:28 2015 UTC,"I see. If I find frozen or fresh cranberries, do I need to do anything to prep them? As in mash, puree, or anything like that other than freeze?"
Homebrewing,3dxq8x,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"No. You don't want to process cranberries too much, and two freeze-thaw cycles is more than enough (maybe too much). You have to be prepared for the risk of wild bugs with any uncooked fruit, but frozen fruit undergoes a dip in sanitizer before it's frozen so that helps, and I already mentioned the high phenol (tannin) and pectin levels."

Homebrewing,3dy64n,Bellymoor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:31 2015 UTC,"I am usually pretty selfish, but I have already posted this one a few times.  9lb Belgian Pils  2 lb Dark Wheat Malt  1.5 Vienna Malt  1.5lb Crystal 20L  .5 oz Hallertau, 1.5 oz Saaz, .5 Styrian Goldings at 60 min. .5 oz Saaz at 30, .5 Hallertau at 20, and .5 Styrian Goldings at 15 minutes.   I mashed low, like 148 low, fermented high-ish, and brought it upstairs to finish where it was at least 75 ambient, possibly a bit more than that. I hit 84% attenuation.  I definitely used WLP565, but I might have used S-05 as well. Its listed in the yeast section of my program, but I don't recall doing that.   I zested a lot of lemons to get an ounce of it using the fine side of a cheese grater. I will never do this again, and invest in a real zester. I rubbed my lemon acid drenched fingers and knuckles against that grater, and it sucked! I took 1 oz black peppercorns, put them in a zip lock, and smashed them. Grinding would make removal a bitch when you go to keg or bottle. I added these both at 10 minutes to flame out. In hindsight, I think 3/4 to 7/8 oz peppercorns might have been ideal. It was a little too spicy for some, and it kind of builds up on your tongue. It is not the first sip, but the subsequent ones that got to be a bit much.   Like I said, I had people say it was amazing and other say they picked up flavors other than lemon or pepper. I do think they kind of melded to create something unique.   I intend to brew this again with cucumber instead of lemon. Probably getting racked onto it though. I had intended to have already had it brewed and racked, but this summer has been too busy. Nothing has been brewed since May 30th. All the things I wanted to enjoy in the dog days of summer will be had in September and October it seems."

When I brewed this beer, I saved my sugar, and added half each time I did a dry hop addition.  Sugar was dissolved in one cup of water, which was briefly boiled.  This solution was added directly to the fermentor.      Fermentation Notes: Start fermentation at the bottom of the range for this yeast (66 degrees F), then ramp up to 72 degrees F by the end of the second day to help ensure ester production and proper attenuation.      Tasting Notes:  Aroma is huge and heavenly.  Massive hoppiness dominates.  The biggest component I get is a lemon/lime citrusy portion, but there is also a strong, sweet, generic ""fruity"" that is quite prevalent; also, there's is a touch of that Conan peach here, too, though it is very mild.  Malt is reserved, but not missing - I get mild toastiness behind it all.   Flavor is (not surprisingly) huge and hoppy up front, though there is definitely enough malt to hold it all up.   If I want to pick it apart and really focus on the individual flavors, I can pick up on some toastiness in the middle... also, I may be nuts, but I swear I can pick up on a hint of honey.  Let's not kid anybody, though - hops are the star of this show.   Finish is bitter and dry, but pleasingly so; there is zero astringency here, just that pleasant hop aftertaste that says ""take another sip"".    Mouthfeel is on the light side of balance, though a bit more substantive than I would have expected from a 1.011 FG.  It almost has a hint of creaminess to it.      Credits: The seeds for this beer were first sown last year when a kind brewer (screen name of GirkinFirker both here and at reddit) was kind enough to send me the ECY29 (Conan) yeast - best known as the yeast from the famous commercial beer, Heady Topper.    I started thinking of a fruity IPA, and began researching hop varieties that would go well with the expected peachiness from the Conan yeast.  The reddit homebrewing sub was useful in my research, but truly, our charter member email list (with special shout out to Testingapril) was invaluable.  I then got to thinking of an international brew, what with all the ingredients I had, and another charter member (uberg33k) got me hooked on the idea of a nontraditional sugar.    All told, I'm loving the idea of having ingredients from seven different countries (and at least four US states) represented.  This kind of beer would have obviously been impossible in the past; this truly is a golden age for homebrewing.  As for the name - well, the play on words (Conan the barbarian) was too easy and fun to resist.  The ""wandering"" bit is a nod to the wide range of ingredients.      View original recipe page"

Used kegs used to be super-common and cheap as dirt, so no one was making any new ones, there wasn't enough market.  The few that did get made were sold for high prices.    Then the used supply started to dry up and prices rose.  Brewers had to start paying more and more for used kegs and some started saying to themselves ""why don't I just pay extra for a new one, without all the dents and not full of rotting soda syrup?"".  With that the market for new kegs started to expand and manufacturers started making more and more and we come to the present.  There's enough of a market that prices have started to drop and while it's not as nice as $10 ball locks, paying $70 for a brand new keg that will probably outlive you isn't that bad."

Homebrewing,3dy7s2,VoyageofCollosus,4,Mon Jul 20 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"The things that always bothered me about BB kits (I've only done one) is the 5oz bag of priming sugar. Priming sugar needs vary based on a number of factors: final volume of beer, maximum temp of beer post-active fermentation, and desired volumes of CO2. A priming sugar calculator should always be employed to determine how much sugar to add, for the best results.  Since this is a Tripel you might be facing the fact that it'll take longer to carb up at higher ABV. Or it may be that the beer got warmer post-active fermentation than Brew's Best assumed. At this point, only time will tell."
Homebrewing,3dy7s2,TheDarkHorse83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a very unskilled homebrewer, and I've used these kits.

I'm sure a lot of it is lack of experience on my end, and I didn't have a batch ready for bottling, but it's frustrating."
Homebrewing,3dy7s2,iregretjumping,3,Tue Jul 21 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"This kit was the first kit I brewed when I got back into homebrewing last winter. Couple of things ....  1) While it's always important to follow instructions, I always use a priming sugar calculator to make sure you get the right volume of CO2. Looks like 4 oz. is pretty close to where you want to be. Definitely avoid adding too much sugar, since overcarbing high abv's in normal bottles can lead to some explosions!  2) High abv's are going to take a while to bottle condition. I have the same concerns as you, but after a month the CO2 was becoming noticeable, and after two months it was starting to hit the sweet spot. So just be a bit patient!  I'm sure someone more experienced can give you better advice, or correct me if I'm wrong, but you're probably on the right course.   (Also, try and get those gravity readings. It gives you an excuse to try your beer throughout the brewing process!)"

This was our first time brewing with a kit too, i should add, and we just forgot to do the gravity readings.

And what risk does it pose when we expose the wort to the air like that?"
Homebrewing,3dy7s2,medicmurke,2,Mon Jul 20 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"While it's another piece of equipment to clean, I prefer a wine thief. Just put your hydrometer inside, dip it inside your carboy (after you've added the final 2.5 gallons of water) so that the hydrometer floats and you'll have your OG! You can then return your sample to the carboy or to a glass for tasting. Do the same before bottling (or in between to check on how it's fermenting) to get your FG.   Each time there's always a risk of infection, but with proper sanitation you'll be fine."

Bottle carbonation works best at 70f and typically most average (4-6% abv beers) take 3 weeks at that temp. Higher abv? It'll take longer, that yeast you bottled with is already pooped from chomping through that high a gravity wort to begin with. Are you storing it below 70f? The yeast will be sleepy and take longer to carb up, move the bottles to a warmer location. It'll be done when it's done, just give it time. Two weeks isn't enough time for a high gravity beer. Good luck with your hooch!"

It was really 2 birds with one stone since I hadn't made a starter before but I decided to build a huge starter for two batches, and a jar for later use. Such value! It is also much easier since you can just grab a jar full of your starter and be done with it without adding water, decanting several times, etc, and it'll be a cleaner yeast because you can control it based on how you build your starter! I'd definitely recommend it and I'm planning to stash a ton of yeast. WLP004 and WLP300 so far.. next up WLP060!"
Homebrewing,3dyohf,troglodytes82,2,Mon Jul 20 16:41:20 2015 UTC,Add it to the beer in small amounts and taste as you go. Or do the same to known sample volumes until you get the right mix and then scale up.
Homebrewing,3dyohf,mutedog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:55 2015 UTC,Good call. I think I'll do this until I get the correct strength of overall flavor in the final product.

Homebrewing,3dyohf,mutedog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:11:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't know about ratios, I thought you had tinctures of both. You could always make a tincture of the orange peel I guess."

Homebrewing,3dyohf,greymud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"Be very VERY careful with lavender. It has very strong aromatic compounds in it which will soak to a high grade if you put it in a tincture.   I would never put that in beer until at the final stages of fermentation, or at bottling.   You don't want to ferment those compounds really, since they are used in manufacturing of perfume, and aromatics of that nature can be VERY difficult to manage correctly in fermentation."

Homebrewing,3e04pk,philippeowagner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:48 2015 UTC,I've fermented in a corny keg a couple times. It works alright. Since you sort of have less headspace you might get more blowoff. One time I just took off the gas post and put in a blow off tube. I've also used some of the fermentation lids (aih has them on sale right now https://www.homebrewing.org/Cornelius-Keg-Lid-for-Secondary-Fermenter_p_999.html) both seemed to work fine for me.
Homebrewing,3dymlp,butlermonkey,9,Mon Jul 20 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"Save your back, stop shaking.  30 psi for 24 hours, disconnect gas and purge the keg, then set to 10 psi."

Homebrewing,3dymlp,Maybesilver,6,Mon Jul 20 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:      I returned about 2 hours later and could hear a distinct hissing. Additionally, my tank and regulator were frosted over and the temp controller readout showed 35 F. I attempted shaking the kegs again but couldn't tell if more gas was running into the kegs.      After you hook up the gas, you need to test your kegs for leaks before you leave them for any period of time, or you'll drain your CO2 tank. Spray some Starsan on the lid and look for bubbles. If you see any, you have a leak. 35F is a little colder than ideal beer serving temperature, but definitely shouldn't cause your keg to leak. In fact, it's better to have colder beer when you're force carbonating, because CO2 is more soluble in cold beer.   Unless I get different/better advice from everyone, next time I will simply check the temp of the beer (for the PSI calculation) that was just racked into the keg, carbonate one keg at a time (outside the chest freezer) by running in the CO2 and shaking until the gas no longer runs.      I think you might want to research a bit more about how to keg and carbonate--those online kegging guides are not that much help if you don't know the basics. There are a couple ways you can carbonate your beer, but in any event, you generally have to leave the gas hooked up for days to weeks, not hours, and you need the gas hooked up at serving pressure if you want your beer on tap.     At 10 PSI, you'll have to leave the gas hooked up to the keg for at least a week (and probably longer) before the beer is carbonated. You hook up the gas, make sure there's no leaks, and leave it for two weeks. There are force carb methods that take less time (and sometimes involve rocking--not shaking--the keg back and forth gently), but you usually start at 30 PSI and reduce to serving pressure over the course of a few days.    Here's a good video guide that you might find helpful! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEMxBPxb1vE"
Homebrewing,3dymlp,VeggieAstronomer,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback. I did a leak test with starsan prior to leaving it and didn't detect any leaks but I could have missed something.   Here is my complaint. I used the PDF that is the listed resource for kegging on this sub's wiki and you are telling me that the guide is all sorts of wrong. The guide basically says ""by applying 10 PSI at 42F your beer should be carbinated in 15 min."" How can that guide get it THAT WRONG??"
Homebrewing,3dymlp,propanolol,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"Almost there, it says: ""by applying 10 PSI at 42F and rolling on the floor for 15min your beer should be carbonated"". As you probably noted, there's a lot of ways to carbonate your beer and all of them work. I'm an advocate of the ""set and forget"" method. I set the PSI to get the carbonation level I want, and have my lines balanced (3/16"" tubing helps with this) to get about 0.5 PSI at the tap! That way, I never have to change the PSI on the regulator."

Homebrewing,3dymlp,somethin_brewin,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"A note on your regulator attachment:  You say you used teflon tape to ensure a seal between your gas bottle and your regulator. The threading on that connector isn't what provides the seal. It seals due to mechanical pressure against an o-ring in the stem of the regulator.  In the best case, thread tape will do nothing at all. Worst case, if it's wrapped badly, it could spoil your seal and cause a leak."
Homebrewing,3dymlp,thegreybush,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:08 2015 UTC,You are absolutely correct. I just have experienced better connections and less leaks using teflon tape since it helps the thread interaction.

The application of teflon tape will only act as a thread locker, and will have no bearing on whether or not the connection leaks.    Just food for thought, I have had several gas leaks over the years, and that connection has never been the source."

The easiest way is to just pour from the bottle in a manner which doesn't disturb the sediment at the bottom. Leave about an inch or so of beer in the bottle, and swirl all of the sediment into suspension. Then just pitch that into the beer your fementing.  The more effective thing to do is to do the same thing as far as pouring/drinking the beer goes, but build up the cultures in a starter before pitching it into your fementer. It'll give you a healthier and larger cell count.   Here is a list of commercial bottles with  viable bacteria and/or Brett.

When I say the refractometer isn't super accurate I mean you'll probably waver between ~2-3 points of the actual gravity.

Last I checked, atmospheric pressure here was 740 torr. Vapor pressure of water at 99C is 730 torr (100C gives 760 torr), so my thermometer also slightly off or the pressure is lower today.

Homebrewing,3dvg9y,garrettrinpoche,2,Sun Jul 19 23:21:09 2015 UTC,"^ This, but it should only change by a few points, still really fast fermentation and high attenuation. Corrected at 88 degrees would be 1.009. 20 hours is a quick fermentation, let it rest for a few days and clean up before you taste it."
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,BrewMC,4,Sun Jul 19 23:55:34 2015 UTC,"I'm curious.. if attenuation is complete, can you just as easily let the 'clean up' phase happen in bottle? I know people say to leave in primary for a while but if you're fully 'fermented', wouldn't the yeast continue to complete their job in bottle?"
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,tallboybrews,2,Mon Jul 20 03:30:11 2015 UTC,How are you carbonating? Sugar? That is a new feed for the yeast and they won't remove the off flavors the rest is meant for. You let it rest after fermentation in order to convert the diacetyl molecules produced from the sugars back into an alcohol.
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,GoldenTechy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:22:23 2015 UTC,"I understand that they'll consume sugar first, but that doesn't take too long. After that, they'll get back to work on the off-flavours, no?"
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,tallboybrews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:56 2015 UTC,I'm with you on that. Shorter ferments and longer conditioning in the bottle seems to work well for me.

Homebrewing,3dvg9y,JamesBHowat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's a really solid point. There might not be risk of bottle bombs if you're fully attenuated, but flocculation likely isn't anywhere near complete. My second beer had an unsettling amount of yeast in bottle. I don't remember how long I waited to bottle it, but I guess it wasn't long enough! (There could be other factors too of course)"
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,tallboybrews,2,Mon Jul 20 23:42:38 2015 UTC,Definitely VERY fast but makes sense with that high of a temp. Add to that good aeration and a big starter of an aggressive yeast like saison and it's pretty clear what's going on. OP be glad this is a style in which some phenols isn't such a huge deal and try to keep it between 68-78 if you can.
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,garrettrinpoche,2,Mon Jul 20 00:49:48 2015 UTC,I took the temp schedule from here: http://www.candisyrup.com/uploads/6/0/3/5/6035776/summer_saison_-_variation_007x.pdf  ... funny enough I never reached 89.
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,fiveohnoes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:33:53 2015 UTC,"88 isn't ""really hot"" for a saison.  Blaugies ferments around 86F, Dupont around 90-95F.  I would still let the beer sit on the cake for a minimum of 7 days and then if you're feeling antsy bottle and condition for 4-6 weeks."
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,gscratch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed - however, for a saison I would most certainly be leaving it on the cake for longer.  My saisons rest for 30 days during fermentations, but I like the Wyeast Saison (it's a slow chewer) and maintain 30c post fermentation, then crash for a week cold before bottling.  There are a LOT of phenols produced in a fermentation like that.  Nice to give the yeast a chance to clean up after itself."
Homebrewing,3dvg9y,fiveohnoes,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:29 2015 UTC,Indeed. I typically leave mine on the cake for a minimum of 2 weeks and then bottle condition for at least 4 weeks. Blaugies and Dupont both also condition all of their bottles in house for a minimum of 6 weeks. Not a coincidence. Bottom line is your saison/farmhouse ale will improve with some age.

Manufacturer recommended ~10g/100L, so since I have ~20L, I pitched 2 packs.  Secondly, I re-hydrated at manufacturer recommended temps, and left it for 30 mins before pitching Thirdly, I made sure the temp of re-hydrated yeast matched my wort to not shock them  I pitched at 84F No oxygenation - I read that it has very little benefit with dried yeast (http://www.danstaryeast.com/articles/aeration-and-starter-versus-wort)"

Homebrewing,3dxc2n,codeine_fiend,4,Mon Jul 20 08:47:25 2015 UTC,I'd be worried about fusel alcohols at those temperatures. No reason to not let it ferment out and try it when it's done though. Give it time and see what happens.
Homebrewing,3dxc2n,ccoch,2,Mon Jul 20 11:47:05 2015 UTC,"The only way you'll know for sure is to try it when fermentation is complete. That having been said, MOST fermentation issues (in my experience, about 200 batches at home around 100 commercially) can be solved with time.  If you can keep that batch at or around 60F for a few weeks, it's possible that the yeast will clean up any phenolics given off due to a high ferment temp.  What yeast did you use?"
Homebrewing,3dxc2n,DrunkBaconGod,2,Mon Jul 20 09:55:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the critical time is the first 2-3 days in terms of temp control. It's better you caught it now rather than on day 3. Other than that, you'll have to wait and see. Sounds like you were on it quick, so it's easier to have positive feelings about the outcome. Best of luck!"
Homebrewing,3dxc2n,chino_brews,2,Mon Jul 20 13:05:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely a chance the beer could end up tasting very hot due to fusel alcohol production... dropping the fermentation temp is great, is it still fermenting? I ask only because dropping 20 degrees or so could also risk causing the yeast to floc out... mind you, you didn't really have a lot of choice!"
Homebrewing,3dxc2n,meekbrewingco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:55 2015 UTC,"Good chance it will give you headaches, but it's only one batch! Learn from this (just like I did) and make the next one better. Put it in that ice bath right away next time (not a freezing cold ice bath, but get it to around 60, then pitch the yeast. From there, you can let the temp rise a little."

Assuming your kettle is around ~16 inches tall, your wort will be at the 10 inch mark by the end of your boil, meaning only 4 inches of the strainer is in the wort. All this to is to say, I'd go for the 14 inch one if you can swing it. Or just build your own hop spider for like $20.  edit: formatting edit again: sorry for the dubstep, not my video"

Homebrewing,3dyh4s,balathustrius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:08 2015 UTC,"I suspect one of a few things.  One, you might want to check your thermometer.  If you actually mashed at like 147, that might account for the FG.  Two, maybe the mash temp hadn't settled when you took the temp and you actually mashed much lower?  Three, maybe you have a wild yeast infection.  After 60 minutes at 155 you certainly shouldn't have any beta amylase to make the beer have such high attenuation."
Homebrewing,3dyh4s,afr0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:09 2015 UTC,"I make a lot of mead, but don't have all-grain gear for beer, so I was using a friend's equipment with his help. He's the manager of my local homebrew shop, so I trust his equipment is solid. He had a dial thermometer that he uses for his own brews, which come out as-intended. He took several temperature readings and swirled the water to avoid hot spot issues. He used an online calculator to determine what temperature to hit so that it would come down to 155 when mixed with the grist. And again after that, he verified the temperature in a couple of spots - dead on. Post-mash, the temperature had only fallen a couple of degrees.  ""Wild"" yeast is a reasonable thought. I use a lot of wine yeast and wouldn't be totally surprised at some cross-contamination, but I also have very high confidence in my sanitation practices. As stated, I make a lot of meads (and ciders), but I have yet to get an infection of any kind.  I don't mean to shoot you down or say that you aren't right - I'll double check temperature next time with my trusty alcohol thermometers and be EXTRA thorough with sanitaiton - but I don't find those two answers to be likely candidates."
Homebrewing,3dyh4s,afr0,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"Wine yeast is actually less likely to ferment that low given the complex sugars in a beer, so I doubt it'd be wine yeast."

Honestly, the best thing for making cleaning carboys easier in tight spaces is to switch to PET. They are so light, you can fill them with a a very tiny amount of water/cleaning solution, and slosh them clean.  Also, you don't need to soak items to sanitize them. Fill a spray bottle with no-rinse sanitizer. You can just spray down most surfaces, including the inside of bottles. Small parts and bottle caps can be soaked in a bowl. Make the sanitizer using jugs of distilled water. To clean the inside of tubing/siphons, rack the sanitizer to an empty jug. To sanitize carboys, it just takes a few ounces that you slosh around."
Homebrewing,3dy2a4,GenocideJuice,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"I agree it sounds like an infected beer. It's hard to tell from the pic -- it could be yeast rafts, or the start of pellicle formation.   Bottle it this week and wait it out ...   NO!! You shouldn't bottle this beer because any wild microbes will very slowly continue eating away at anything they can eat (starch, dextrins, etc.) over a period of months, and you will almost definitely end up with gushers or bottle bombs if you bottle this before they are done. If you are going to wait it out, you have to do it in the fermentor, and plan on not bottling it until the SG gets into the single digits (under 1.010) and remains stable over several weeks. A wild fermentation can conceivably finish below 1.000 SG.   ... or throw in the towel and dump it?   You probably shouldn't plan on using that bucket for a clean beer ever again. So if you don't have another use for the bucket, and you have the space and patience to let it go, you could see how it  develops. I suspect most unintentionally sour beer is not good, but that's just a guess, and if everyone in history threw out every sour batch, we wouldn't have found any good sour bugs, huh?"
Homebrewing,3dy2a4,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an infection.  I would give it some additional time in the fermenter and see what it tastes like.

Homebrewing,3dy2a4,homebrewfinds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:00:12 2015 UTC,"So you're suggesting to replace the fermentor but not the rest of his equipment after bottling? Bottling equipment has a lot more places for bugs to hide. Please don't do this op if you think you have an infection.  To the op, if you don't like the beer dump it. It will not get better. The beer will mellow but still be painful to drink. After you dumb it soak the fermentor in bleach, it'll be fine to use again. Try looking back to see where you could've possibly  introduced the infection although in the picture it looks fine."

After the tour, enjoy some lambics (two samples). You can buy more. Be sure to pet the brown dog wandering around. It has some weird whooping cough but it's very friendly.   After Cantillon, wander over to Grand Place. Ignore the first beer store near manneken pis (it's a euro or two more per beer) and go straight to Beer Planet. They have lots of beer in every nook and cranny, and you can get things like Westvleteren 12, 8,and 6 if you like.   Next head to Beer Temple. More organized than Beer Planet, everything is on shelves. There are A LOT of them. Lambics and gueuzes are in the back; you'll be looking for them after Cantillon.   From there, head to Delirium village. The first small bar on the left will give you a relaxed drinking spot with lots of the menu. Further down the alley is the tourist pub with lots on tap but it tends to be louder.   I'd recommend getting a room for the night so you can drink. I stayed at the Adagio right next to De Brouckere metro stop on Blvd Anspach.   I'm Canadian, only been to Brussels twice. First time was as one of the cities we visited, the second was taking the train from Paris to buy beer. I WISH it were a car ride away. :)   Edit:  Here's me and that whooping cough brew dog.

Homebrewing,3dx9to,hedgecore77,2,Mon Jul 20 11:47:06 2015 UTC,Please let me know if you have any more questions.  I've only been twice but let's just say the first time I ended up at Schipol throwing out beer because my luggage was overweight.  The second time I brought a luggage scale and my fiance and I ended up drinking beer on the sideawalk outside of the Arc de Triomphe at 7:00AM before our flight. :)  (We were both 0.2lbs under the weight limit)
Homebrewing,3dx9to,Hammbo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:59 2015 UTC,"If you can, go to Bruge and visit De Halve Maan brewery. It has a great historically based tour that goes through the brewing process and shows how they did it even a couple hundreds years ago. There's been a brewery on that site since the 1200s iirc, though the old tanks and methods don't quite go back that far. Still, it's my favorite brewery tour ever. Of course, the town if Bruge is also quite historic and fun to tour in and of itself :-). I think it was only about a 45 minute train ride from Brussels, and only cost like €20 to get there and back.   Someone else mentioned delerium cafe also. That's a great place to grab a pint or five in Brussels. I'd definitely recommend it!  There was a nice pub in Antwerp as well that I visited, the name of which slips my mind. It overlooked the cathedral in the middle of town though and had some out door seating. It was a great place to sample some local beers and people watch.   Enjoy your trip!"

The judges were Ray Daniels, Geoff Larson, and Harold Gulbransen, three people for whom I have the utmost respect in all things beery. Geoff and Ray actually wrote the book on smoked beers. Geoff and Alaskan Brewing Company pretty much defined the style with their smoked porter. And Harold brews some of the most fantastically well- balanced smoked beers I have ever tasted. Bamberg is his favorite town in Germany. To have those three deem this smoked porter as worthy of a medal was quite an honor. Alaskan Brewing keeps a stash of its smoked porter from each year. The differences between vintages are amazing and complex. This is a great beer to brew every year and then store in the cellar for several years.

Homebrewing,3dvse3,ShamrockAPD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:15 2015 UTC,Yeah it's tough to get a nice fresh strawberry flavor rather than more stewed/funky which I think is why you don't see many non-sour beers with strawberries (a notable exception being abita's summer seasonal.) You need to somehow filter or kill the yeast before adding the strawberries so that the fruit isn't fermented to really get a good strawberry flavor that holds up. Be sure to prep your fruit by pasteurization or soaking in alcohol if you try this.
Homebrewing,3dvse3,TheReverend5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:23:29 2015 UTC,"Well it seems like at this point I'm leaning far away from strawberries, which is kinda a bummer! So raspberries or cherries it is."

Homebrewing,3dueg1,Agent000,3,Sun Jul 19 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of people say you should soak the rice overnight and steam it. I tried that method and it didn't come out any different than when I just boil it like normal.  All you need is some cooked rice and a Chinese-style yeast ball (jiuqu, I got a bunch off of importfood.com for ridiculously cheap, you could also use koji as it's a similar colony).  You just cook the rice, let it cool to body temp, mix a crushed yeast ball in, then cover and wait.  Tomorrow there should be white mold on the surface (aspergillus oryzae) which breaks down the rice starches and lets the yeast digest the resulting simple sugars."

I ferment around 62-64F... enough to give the hint of fruitiness that is appropriate to the style without being overly estery.  I don't have a ""lagering"" setup, so I primary at 62-64 until active fermentation is mostly done (3-4 days), then give it another week or so to free rise to 68-72 (room temp) to finish out and clean up.  Then I cold crash and gelatin (3 days or so), then into the keg.  I usually let the keg sit for at least 4 weeks before tapping it, but I find it peaks in flavor around 6-8 weeks post kegging."

It doesn't look like mold so I would taste it and see how it tastes. If its drinkable I would go for it. Try your hardest not to disturb all that stuff on the top though."
Homebrewing,3dz334,tallboybrews,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:20 2015 UTC,"Bubbles. And definitely not mold. I haven't had much of a pellicle from lacto before, so wondering if there might be some other bugs in there. Not tasting any brett or pedio though..."
Homebrewing,3dz334,MillionMonkeyArmy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"Can't say I'm able to confirm anything by looking at a pellicle, but I think you could have some brett in there.  I did have a pellicle like that on my Berliner Weiss.  Had a couple of microbio experts explain to me that lacto shouldn't form a pellicle unless there's a lot oxygen present.  Instead they were telling me that the pellicle was due to brett.    Just to confirm, I popped a sample under my new microscope and sure enough...brett.  Could also make out tiny lacto (rod-shaped bacteria anyway).  No idea where the brett came from either, but it's not unwelcome in my Berliner."

Homebrewing,3dw4nt,paperturtlex,3,Mon Jul 20 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"Can't answer some of those questions,  but lhbs appears to be been expanded from a liquor store.  The owner/manager has basically no experience homebrewing,  another employee managers their homebrew inventory and grains and stuff, while a third employee homebrews quite a bit.   I would say you should definitely know about ingredients,  and general knowledge,  as your customers will definitely expect you to be able to answer questions."

Homebrewing,3dwgou,stanstanstanhagen,2,Mon Jul 20 02:43:21 2015 UTC,Take off the stone and coupler after every use. I typically get 10-14 per tank with 60sec infusions. I turn it on just enough to see a very light bubbling on the top.  But if you leave the stone and coupler on it will be gone in no time.

Homebrewing,3dv510,arseniq33,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:00:55 2015 UTC,Yes. My original kettle which you can see next to my new one fit on 2 burners (gas stove) and got to a boil pretty quickly as long as I started bringing my first 4 gallons of runnings up to a boil while I collected my remaining runnings. The new Ss kettle fits one burner and didn't take too long because I made sure to employ the same preheating method. Cheers!

At less than $0.50 per beer, that's less than $275.00. 550 beers comes out to 91.67 6-packs. 91.67 6-packs at $9.99 (the price of my usual 6-pack) comes out to $915.75.

Homebrewing,3drfga,mitchard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:53:27 2015 UTC,Ya it actually turned out pretty well.  I only fermented for 2wks so the yeast still had a lot of life in them.  Plus they were kept at like 70F which I'm sure helped.

Homebrewing,3drfga,drivebyjustin,2,Sat Jul 18 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the brewery and what glue they use as well as the permeability of the labels. Some of them literally fall right off after a short soak, some need to be scraped and rubbed and still leave a sticky residue. It's specifically the reason I only reuse New Glarus bottles; the labels are by far the easiest to remove that I've found.

Homebrewing,3dw4l0,nzo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:39 2015 UTC,Reason I'm a bit skeptical about this yeast is I took two separate readings within 4 days then a temperature increase for 3 more and still no change in gravity. I'm definitely going to do this at a higher temp though next time. I appreciate this reply to this very specific question. Thanks!
Homebrewing,3dw4l0,nzo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:02:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some brewers love this strain. Not one of my favorites I must admit."
Homebrewing,3dw4l0,nzo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:34:33 2015 UTC,I'm super curious to see what a ale yeast tastes like on the low temperature end of fermentation. Have you made any lagers with ale yeast before? What do you prefer?
Homebrewing,3dw4l0,greygringo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"lagers with ale yeast before   IIRC, once- ages ago. It was okay. I generally ferment at the lowest end of recommended ferm temps (+ a little sometimes) for whatever strain/style I am brewing.   As far as a preference, these days I am using a blend of WY1764 w/15% WY1056. It seems to help w/attenuation of the WY1764, especially after 5+ generations. As always, YMMV."
Homebrewing,3dw4l0,greygringo,2,Mon Jul 20 04:18:08 2015 UTC,A blend! Interesting. I wish Wyeast was cheaper here ($22 US a pack) to be able to blend. I need to start harvesting. Thanks again for sharing.
Homebrewing,3dw4l0,i_upvote_nothing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:11 2015 UTC,"The only sluggishness I've seen out of WY1007 is that it takes a while to get started but once it does it's an explosive fermentation. I usually let it go at room temp though. The yeast ferments clean, even at higher temps. I haven't noticed any off flavors anyway.   OP might want to rock his fermenter a bit to kick some of the yeast back up into solution. The ones that aren't stuck in the permakrausen flocculate readily at lower temps."
Homebrewing,3dvy5h,jexmex,4,Sun Jul 19 23:57:13 2015 UTC,Reverse Osmosis water. It is a way to remove ions from the water and delivers a product similar to destilled water except it retains the dissolved gasses.
Homebrewing,3dvy5h,chocoladisco,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:07 2015 UTC,Ahh ok basically the stuff the water stores delivers. Is it advised for people with hard well water?
Homebrewing,3dvy5h,bluespringsbeer,3,Mon Jul 20 00:06:08 2015 UTC,It is not advised to brew with RO water directly because it doesn't have enough minerals. You'll need to add back in a certain amount of minerals to brew with it. It just gives you a clean slate to work for customizing your water. It also allows you to dilute hard water until the minerals are as low as you want.
Homebrewing,3dvy5h,Fenix159,7,Mon Jul 20 00:10:49 2015 UTC,You can however brew with RO water if you're using extract.
Homebrewing,3dvy5h,elreeso55,6,Mon Jul 20 01:29:12 2015 UTC,"It's actually preferable to use RO water with extract, since the extract was made using water than already had minerals in it."

WLP008 East Coast Ale yeast : Description says really similar WLP001, but more tart, doesn't accentuate hops as well, and still has low esters.  Use it for Pale ales?

Homebrewing,3dttwa,DeadNerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:27 2015 UTC,"I brewed a pumpkin ale last night, and everything went great. I don't have a wort cooler, so after the boil, I used some freezer cold bottled spring water to top up to 5 gallons, which dropped the temp down to 125 pretty quickly. Then I sealed it up in the fermenter with a blow off tube (everything sanitized), and left it overnight to cool off.   This morning, the temperature was 78*F. I took the OG and it was 1.078 (adjusted for temp). According to Brewtoad, this recipe should have an OG of 1.067.   Where could I have gone wrong? Are there any issues with it being higher than planned? Is there anything I should do to fix it?"
Homebrewing,3dttwa,dzsquared,2,Sun Jul 19 14:53:52 2015 UTC,"It's possible that the sample you got for the OG wasn't uniform, in that the malt is unevenly distributed in the ""solution"".

Homebrewing,3dttwa,DeadNerd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:07:02 2015 UTC,I did steep them. The sample may not have been uniform although it was pretty well mixed in last night. I've already pitched the yeast. Should I take another reading or just leave it alone now?

Homebrewing,3dttwa,bambam944,2,Sun Jul 19 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"A couple of guesses...  OG measurements can be hit and miss on measuring an extract brew as sometimes the extract doesn't blend totally with the added water. I would oxygenate by stirring, swirling, ect, then try another measurement (assuming you haven't added yeast yet - if you have, don't stir things around as you could oxidize your batch).  Assuming you followed the recipe and water volumes correctly you should be pretty bang on with your gravity when using extract.  Another guess might be the canned pumpkin. Did the pumpkin you used have added sugar or other sweeteners that maybe bumped up your gravity?"
Homebrewing,3dttwa,DeadNerd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:11:08 2015 UTC,Good question about the pumpkin. The cans said 100% pure pumpkin. But you're right... I'll just DWRHAHB. The only reason I really cared about the OG was to get a more accurate FG and ABV. Thanks!!
Homebrewing,3dttwa,mattzm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"Possibly a silly question. Yesterday, it seems like the temp probe in my mash controller went a bit squiffy and seems to be reporting temperatures about 15-20 degrees lower than it should be.  I've no idea if it went wrong before, during or after the mash, though it was one of the smoothest mashes yet I've gotten out of the controller in terms of ""temperature"" staying constant. I hit my pre-boil gravity and SG pretty much perfectly on target, so I assume it went wrong after the mash and it's bubbling away happily now. Still, I'm curious, what would be effects here? Usually I'm fighting to keep it below and not overshoot."
Homebrewing,3dttwa,pricelessbrew,2,Sun Jul 19 15:24:58 2015 UTC,FG could be very different than intended. Mashing at 140 instead of 158 will give a different lower FG as the mash will be more fermentable.

Homebrewing,3dvop0,NDAugustine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:33:18 2015 UTC,What sorts of changes would one need to make on the fly?
Homebrewing,3dvop0,NDAugustine,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:34 2015 UTC,"Our thought would be the ability to ramp up or down temperature, and set the time period for the ramp, using the smartphone interface. You could do this manually after fermentation reaches certain points, or program it in from the start. For lagering, we think this would be particularly useful. I think this is possible with the STC, however, I think it needs custom firmware for profiling, and is a pain to setup."
Homebrewing,3dvop0,drivebyjustin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe people would go for this. I'll say as a homebrewer and consumer, I wouldn't. I'm not technologically inclined in the least and I was able to set up my STC-1000+."
Homebrewing,3dvop0,NDAugustine,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:58 2015 UTC,Cold crash sooner than anticipated? Do a diacytal rest that you didn't think you would need? Raise temp sooner because gravity dropped faster than you expected. All kinds of reasons.
Homebrewing,3dvop0,drivebyjustin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:35 2015 UTC,I can't wait until I get home? I need to do it right this very minute? I've never experienced that. It seems like this is solving a problem that doesn't really exist.
Homebrewing,3dvop0,NDAugustine,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:03 2015 UTC,Ok? Guess it's not for you then. I just think changing the profiles in stc+ is a bit clunky. I would appreciate something simpler to manipulate.

Homebrewing,3duxrw,pricelessbrew,2,Sun Jul 19 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"When the yeast cells realize that there is no more sugar for them to use, they band together and sink, lying dormant and waiting for better times.   This same process can be induced by cooling, ie cold crashing. You'll find the majority of your yeast in that layer on the bottom, typically a white layer. Decanting won't reduce your cell count, not by any significant amount, that is. It's pretty common to decant a starter before pitching, and swirling to suspend the yeast into the remaining water."
Homebrewing,3duxrw,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I guess I was just curious what percent of the yeast falls out of suspension during cold crashing.

I wired an STC for my fermentation freezer and was planning on using this for my upcoming keezer build. I may actually use this for the fermentation freezer though as I get tired of converting C to F all the time. Especially with complicated lagering schedules.
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,danNYtrack,2,Sun Jul 19 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"why not just flash your STC with stc1000+? it supports changing the controller to fahrenheit, programmable temperature schedules with ramping etc."
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,bovineblitz,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:44 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the + and ability to flash the STC. However, I haven't the hardware required for such a project."

From this post, it looks like they're running the same firmware. The ITC does have Fahrenheit."
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,snoopwire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:12:58 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure an ITC-1000 is just an STC-1000 reprogrammed with an arduino.

I've got an STC1000+ and it's good of course, but I just do not need 99 percent of the functions it offers. I just want dual relay, temp offset and compressor delay. The price is just too good to pass up."

Homebrewing,3dsxwz,testingapril,3,Sun Jul 19 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"Hey cool, I got mine today too!  I'm actually using it with a ghetto HERMS setup I was going to water test today with an STC-1000 but got to use the Inkbird instead.  Worked great!   I'll have my own writeup for it when I get around to it, but really happy with the purchase as well.  FYI, while all the documentation says it's rated to 10A, if you pop the back off you'll see 12A 125VAC 15A 125VAC. Ran a 1500W burner for 3 hours without issue this afternoon."
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,Fenix159,2,Sun Jul 19 03:51:05 2015 UTC,"Just because you ran it for a test without problems doesn't mean you won't have them in the future. Mechanical relays are not designed for the cycling requirements of a HERMS, so they will certainly give out prematurely. SSRs are the way to go for that sort of cycling.  As far as the Amperage rating goes, the reason it's rated for 10A is probably safety factor. Depending on how it's actually wired and how the circuit itself is rated and tested, it may have a practical limit of 12A. In electricity you generally leave 20% overhead in the circuit for safety's sake, so if the circuit is a 12A circuit, it would be prudent to only run it at 10A.  Be careful. You're working with water and electricity together. This can be a deadly combination so an abundance of caution is well advised."
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,dahlberg123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:36:31 2015 UTC,"GFCI all the things of course. Outlets not where water is likely to be (can't account for all things but all reasonable possibilities are covered).   Others have used the STC-1000 with great success over on HBT. I do plan on upgrading to a PID in the future, was mostly curious to see it work with this controller.  Be careful is definitely the best advice anyone can give when undertaking these things. I have consulted an electrician friend and after examining the setup, his advice was ""looks fine but be careful. Water and electricity. Now where's that beer?"""
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,Fenix159,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:41 2015 UTC,I was thinking about doing the same.. what does your setup look like?  Cooper chiller on an induction burner?
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,jon_k,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:02:53 2015 UTC,An induction burner will not work.  I've got it on a hot plate. But otherwise yeah.
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,Fenix159,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:12:43 2015 UTC,"If your device says 10 amps but the inside says 12amp somewhere, beware it may still be rated at 10 amps.  Here's how it works, the 12 amps may be the circuits total rated ampacity (which means the maximum current just before the weakest rated component, wire, relay, outlet fails) but it can support 10 amps constant if all parts are 1-2 amp under rating. Your ampacity is dictated by your lowest rated part/wire/component.  Short bursts of 12 amps (compressor start) are probably totally fine, but continuous 12 amp loads may be destructive. I would measure amperage to see how often 12 amps is required if you use a 12 amp device before putting it on your temp controller.  You can PROBABLY accomplish it, but I'd make sure there's a 12-13 amp fuse so anything over pops the fuse. Premature failure is expected max-rating the wires, relays, plugs and sockets. Things may eventually heat, melt, bend, YMMV   I wouldn't do it. Professional electricians provide equipment 10% between ""ampacity"" and ""max current"" to improve reliability/safety (a failing circuit sometimes becomes unsafe/hot circuit). You follow the same electrical practice when putting loads on circuit breakers, never exceeding 90% capacity to prevent damaging the breaker (or false tripping due to heat.) House wiring should be 90% load when the breaker is at 100% load. You see the pattern here...  These buffers may sound silly most of the time, but they are standards (and mandated by trade standards orgs) because of historical experience on evidenced  reliability (and probably some electrical fires as case study to boot.)"
Homebrewing,3dsxwz,eprams,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"It won't normally be continuous load, as the strike will likely be propane heated and the controller will only need to turn it on to maintain temp."

Each dry yeast pack comes with 600B cells, it is believed, and the typical medium-gravity beer needs at most 210B cells, so even if you do the worst thing and sprinkle into wort, you only kill 40-50% and still end up with enough cells to do the job.

Homebrewing,3dtqrh,beermatty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:23:47 2015 UTC,"First, I would go to the brewer's web sites.  Many craft brewers have notes on ingredients for their recipes.  Adnams is one that gives the base malts and some hop info.    Next, search for clone recipes and compare that to the listed information from the brewer's web site.  Read comments on the clone recipes to determine the accuracy of the cloning attempt.  Lastly, try calling the brewery.  Surprisingly, many craft brewers will share many of the finer points of their recipes, perhaps realizing that process is a great part of creating their particular flavors.  edit: Also, be prepared to do several attempts at each recipe before getting it pretty close.  The more clone recipes you can get and compare, the quicker it may be to hone in on the right recipe."

Homebrewing,3dupp7,teamDINGUS,2,Sun Jul 19 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"Me personally?   To start, I like a relatively simple grain bill. Usually something like 90% pale ale malt (sometimes I'll sub in ~20% wheat) with crystal malt making up the rest, usually 40 or 60L. I know this is blasphemy to Internet homebrewers but if you know how to hit a mash temp and pitch enough yeast, attenuation won't be a problem.  Kettle hops are almost always split into 2 additions, just bittering and flameout. I tend to like lower than usual IBU levels so I'll shoot for around 40ibus from bittering with a low cohumulone hop. I feel flameout additions give a pretty moderate dose of bitterness as well so it probably ends up around 60+ when it's all said and done. Sometimes I'll cool the wort below 180F for a 15 minute hopstand. Yeast is almost always Cal ale at 60-62F ambient. Then it always gets a generous dry hop for 3 to 4 days.   Then it's into the keg with a second round of dry hops. I like to use leaf hops in a nylon mesh bag to keep from clogging the dip tube. I'll carbonate to about 2.6-2.8 volumes to drive up the aromatics.   And there you have it - a highly aromatic, highly flavorful, smooth drinking IPA."

Homebrewing,3dsicp,wizang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:46:53 2015 UTC,The burning is just the CO2.  The rafts you see there I'm not sure if are anything other than regular yeast.  I'd package it regardless.

Homebrewing,3dsicp,_themamabear,3,Sun Jul 19 02:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to be wrong.  My opinion is based on two experiences from the last year.  I had yeast rafts (from WLP028 both times) that looked exactly like that, some sort of strange surface tension was keeping some clumps together with somewhat big bubbles.  Each time I let them sit for a 2 weeks, and no change in appearance or gravity.  Bottled, carbed, conditioned...no infection.  Bottles were fine even two or three months later.  Anyway, it totally could be an infection.  There's really only one way to find out.  Let it sit for a while and take another reading."
Homebrewing,3dsicp,NowhereAtAll,3,Sun Jul 19 03:16:01 2015 UTC,"I almost always say ""no"" and ""RDWHAHB"" to these posts, but that does look a bit suspicious.  Needs a couple more days to be sure.

Homebrewing,3dsicp,pixelrebel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, the pellicle is indicative of an ""infection"", and the sharp burn is from sticking your head too far into concentrated CO2.  They aren't related, but you do have an infection."
Homebrewing,3dsicp,sjmiller85,17,Sun Jul 19 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna disagree and say no infection.  To me those look like some stubborn yeast rafts stuck on some CO2 bubbles.  Unless this gets bigger over the next few days, I think it looks fine.  Assuming you took a gravity reading when you cracked the lid to take this picture, I'd wait a few days and take another.  If it's the same then you should be fine to bottle."

Homebrewing,3dt37k,gnisna,2,Sun Jul 19 12:10:12 2015 UTC,"The grain bill might be Tripel like, but it does sound a lot more like a strong saison. Especially since it's not using abbey ale/Trappist-style ale yeast. Who knows, maybe OPs beer will still taste like a Tripel!"
Homebrewing,3dt37k,TheReverend5,2,Sun Jul 19 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"I consider a Saison to be a very broad range.  This has a tripel grain bill, added sugar and a little coriander.  The final product should be very light in color.  gnisna, you are correct, a strong saison might be a more correct name but it is close in look and taste to a tripel so I felt that tripel does a better job describing the beer.  I designed the beer about a year ago.  I wanted to make a tripel but I had saison yeast.  The result was so good I haven't changed the recipe."
Homebrewing,3dt37k,gnisna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds good to me! I didn't mean to criticize or anything, was just curious why you labeled it as such. I figured you had a reason for it, rather than just for the sake of the grain bill."

I'm also brewing in Mexico so I have very limited ingredients, which influenced my recipe.  I agree, if I am using a Saison yeast I am brewing a Saison.  What do you think about my reasoning?  Do you think that Saison is a very broad style?  Do you think the taste profile will be close to a Tripel?"
Homebrewing,3dt37k,wizang,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, saison is definitely a broad style, if not the broadest?  If it tastes like a tripel, then you may as well call it that.

I like the term feral I haven't heard that applied to hops before. I think that that is a great way to denote what I call 'historically wild' or 'never selected' hops. Hops that are only cross pollinating for a few generations, from choice/prime parents, shouldn't be onion-garlic bombs. I don't know enough about hop genetics/alleles to say that they couldn't, but I would guess from what I know about genetics in general that plants that don't express that would only have that as a recessive trait at most."
Homebrewing,3duiri,SoleiLune,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"I know for the ones in Sebastopol they're probably feral from decades ago, or longer. I read somewhere the most of the old hops grown in California (back when it was common) were some variety of Cluster.

Homebrewing,3dsll1,bigskymind,3,Sun Jul 19 01:35:50 2015 UTC,"I had an RIS stuck at 1.029 recently and tried everything to no avail. I stirred, I warmed and finally racked it to a 5 gallon glass carboy I never use just to free up a fermentor. I waited a few months and pulled a sample and it was 1.027... Waited another month or so and decided it was nearing bottling time because it wasn't budging. I pitched an extra vial of wlp001 I had lying around just to ensure there would be enough yeast for bottle priming (at this point the RIS was about 6 months old). I waited a week and transferred to the bottling bucket where I took a gravity reading and it was 1.022! So, as the great Winston S. Churchill once said ""never give up!"""
Homebrewing,3dsll1,danNYtrack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:03 2015 UTC,I think I will let it sit in the ferm chamber with the brown ale I just brewed for a bit and decide what to do over the next week or two.  I did already pitch some S-05 but I figure there's no oxygen in there and plenty of alcohol so not ideal conditions for fresh yeast. The S-05 showed no signs of activity at all after re-pitching.
Homebrewing,3dsll1,JimMcnasty,3,Sun Jul 19 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"What was your sac rest temp? If you were mashing in the mid to high 150's, that final gravity doesn't surprise me. BJCP guidelines say FG can be up to 1.024. So you are close. You made just have a very dextrinous wort."
Homebrewing,3dsll1,JimMcnasty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:49:38 2015 UTC,"My intended mash temp was 152F but I definitely drifted higher than that a couple of times when pulsing some heat back into the mash part way through.

Control of mash temperatures is the weakest part of my brewing process and would be the next point of upgrade for me."
Homebrewing,3dsll1,chirodiesel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"So you are mashing in a kettle and just turn the burner on and off? You are right. It seems like it would be very hard to keep a constant temp-also to produce consent beers.   Have you tried mashing in an igloo cooler? You don't even need a false bottom. Mash in cooler, then once you have reached conversion, dump it into your lauter tun and start vorlauf.   Or you could wrap some sort of heat resistant fiber glass/insulation around your mash tun."

However, generally speaking, they're mutually exclusive styles.  Biere de Garde is ""Beer for keeping"" and was high-abv heavier beer with low esters that is stored for several months.  Saison is a lighter, lower-abv beer served in summer (the ""Saison"" that the seasonal workers would be hired to help on the farm).  Saison has the characteristic estery flavors produced by yeast that ferment very warm (75F to 85F or higher).

Homebrewing,3dshth,3Vyf7nm4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, it may be more of a Saison than you think.  Because there's so much variety in what's called a Saison, and because so much of the flavors come from the yeasts, it's one of the more ""loose"" styles.  While doing an experiment to determine which Belgian yeast (and blends of those yeasts) I prefer, I came across some unused malts whose contents I didn't remember, so I just brewed them up as though they were a saison ... lo and behold, they brewed a mighty fine (if slightly dark and slightly caramel) saison.  The book recounts the reason for this wide range of the style, and it's a pretty interesting read just for that story."

Homebrewing,3drzg3,aileron_ron,2,Sun Jul 19 05:04:48 2015 UTC,Hey man that's not bad. I did a triple decoction a few months ago. Lasted about 9 hours from strike to cleaned up and garage closed. Unfortunately that beer didn't turn out well at all. I've been meaning to do another one. Did you notice any significant difference in the wort?
Homebrewing,3drzg3,aileron_ron,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually tried to do a hefe all grain before.

The yeast started to go to town about 5 hrs after being pitched, which is way faster than what i normally see. I'm not sure if that has to do with the decoction process or not thought."
Homebrewing,3dqqs6,Sucelos,5,Sat Jul 18 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"Last night we experimented with brewing over an open fire, making 10 gallons of extract Stone Pale Ale clone. Depending on how this turns out, we may try all-grain using this technique (I'm thinking double decoction).  The boil was actually very tricky to control, the best method seemed to be keeping the kettle offset a bit so we could push it closer to the center when it cooled too much, or pull it off as it overheated.  The rack we used to hold the kettle was an aluminum frame with holes drilled into the sealed areas to relieve the pressure build-up from the heat.  Overall, the heating took about 1 hr, and the boil took another hour on top of that.

For everyone who uses Weyermann or equivalent, Munich is actually midway in color between pilsner and crystal 10 with lovibond values of ~6, ~2-3, 10 respectively.

Homebrewing,3drs0y,Mayor_of_tittycity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"Well I've never bought a kit and I wouldn't ever ask for generic ""munich malt"" without knowing exactly what I was getting so I can't comment about that.  Look at Kai Troester's recipes, especially his dunkel (99% weyermann munich II) and doppelbock (78% weyermann munich II) http://www.braukaiser.com/wiki/index.php?title=Recipes  Gordon Strong, Denny Conn, Kai Troester chime in about how ~10L Munich is the way to go: https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/forum/index.php?topic=4971.0  On top of that, all of the recipes in Brewing Classic Styles are formulated for 10L munich malt.   I agree that the fact that most recipes simply call for ""Munich malt"" is problematic, because there's an enormous difference in flavor between the various darkness levels, and that each have their place. But when you're really trying to get a depth of flavor, light munich alone doesn't cut it.   Honestly, though, I think the right way to think about Munich malt is to realize that there is no one Munich malt. For example, Best Malz currently offers four Munich-style (i.e. high kilned with low ventilation) malts which are all very different:  Light Munich at 6-8L  Dark Munich at 8-12L  Light Melanoidin at ~20L  Dark Melanoidin at ~27L  As a brewer, you should really be thinking about the kind of Munich malt flavor and color you want for your recipes, and actually create a blend of the malts to make your own ""house Munich malt"".  I like Weyermann II as a general purpose malt that can stand on its own. For my tastes, Best Malz light is too light, and their dark is too dark, so I like to blend them 50/50. Of course, blending in a dash of melanoidin malt to your Munich blend is not a bad idea either."

Homebrewing,3dr0o6,Jmacadocious,2,Sat Jul 18 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do/did when dialing in a system or process change:    Measure any dead space using cold water.  I then convert to hot water using a 4% expansion factor [ V(ds) = vol retained in system / 1.04; where V(ds) is the dead space volume at sparge/mash temperatures]   On your next brew do the following:   Measure your water carefully into the pot: V(m) as mash water and V(s) as sparge water. Dough in after weighing the grains carefully: W(g) as weight of grains. Measure the volume and gravity (cooled to room temp) your wort from your mash [V(pbh) = pre-boil volume and SG(pb) = gravity of your wort, preboil] After your boil, measure your ending volume and gravity [ V(abh) = volume after boil and SG(ab) is your gravity after boil (taken at room temperature. Convert your hot volume readings to room temperature assuming a 4% expansion factor.  Basically: V(pb) = V(pbh) / 1.04 and V(ab) = V(abh) / 1.04 You can now calculate your water absorption by the grain as V(m) + V(s) - V(ab) - V(ds).  Divide this number by the weight of your grain and you will get the amount of water retained in the grains after mashing and sparging.  You will need to convert this to oz of water per oz of grain to enter it into BeerSmith. Your boil off rate can be calculated by [V(pb) - V(ab)] / time of boil.  Convert this to volume per hour to enter into BeerSmith. You can enter the numbers into BeerSmith to get the Mash Efficiency (which is what I use to dial in my process.  None of this brewhouse crap as I vary that to accommodate the amount of hops and other additives).   I use the gravity readings to verify the accuracy of my volume measurements.  Basically I convert to gravity points and if I am accurate V(pb) * SG(pb) should equal V(ab) * SG(ab) within the margin of my least accurate measurement (for me it is volume, measured to the nearest half liter when hot).   This should get you close for your next brew.  I have found that averaging 3 to 4 brews gets my processes very close and repeatable."
Homebrewing,3dr0o6,Oginme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:33 2015 UTC,"64% isn't unheard of, but I would guess it's your process rather than the settings.  How do you crush your grains? Do you stir thoroughly to make sure there aren't any dough-balls? Is your temperature fairly consistent in the mash? How do you sparge, if at all?  Usually lower efficiency comes primarily from the crush of your grain. If you are getting it crushed at your LHBS and you don't have your own mill, it could be that their setting is the issue. Ask them to double mill your grain if that's the case, but only if you have determined that this is the fault. Otherwise you might end up overmilling them and get stuck sparges, which are a bigger pain to deal with than just adding a few more pounds of grain.  If there are dough balls, the grains stuck in the center of that ball aren't getting the conversion the rest of the mash is, and that loses out on efficiency, so stir them out. Also helps to stir again halfway through the mash just in case you missed any.  If you sparge poorly, you might be leaving a lot of sugars left in the mash that don't make it to the boil kettle. If you only do a single sparge right now, try splitting it into two equal sized sparges. It will add a bit of time to your brew day but help to increase efficiency. I had good luck getting ~80% on my old system doing a full drain followed by two equal sized batch sparges where I would just add the water, stir, wait 10 minutes, and drain again."
Homebrewing,3dr0o6,carboy_coat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"I crush my grains at my lhbs, I have noticed that the gains seem to be split once In the middle Verses completely crushed from time to time. With my last batch I mashed 8n at 148.5 degrees and held it there for about 70 minutes temperature at mash before mash out was 148. I do make sure to stir enough to break up all the dough balls then I stir once more after about 25m. This time I added 4.5qts of 168° water before I mashed out. Then after that I added another 16qts. I don't let it rest in between these steps. Or even stir for that matter. Another thing to note is once I vorlof I open the valve all the way and let her rip."
Homebrewing,3dr0o6,carboy_coat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:41 2015 UTC,"Let it rest, and definitely stir. Letting it rest allows the grain to come to temp (to stop conversion) and helps to distribute the sugars through all the sparge water. Stir because you want to guarantee you're washing all the sugars off those grains. If you don't you're probably leaving a large portion of the grains untouched by that sparge water. Also, try to make those two sparge additions equal, there have been studies showing equal sparge additions allow for better washing of the sugars.  As for the crush of the grain, if you notice it isn't crushed completely, don't be afraid to ask them to double mill them. As I said before, a poor crush is usually the primary issue with efficiency, everything else I mentioned is just icing on the cake."

I used to get similar efficiencies and asked the guy at my lhbs.  He advised to stir around twenty and forty minutes during the mash.  This made sense because I used to only stir at mash in and once more during sparge water additions (batch sparge).  I've found one extra stir somewhere halfway through mashing to be sufficient.  Lo and behold my efficiency immediately jumped to the high seventies and I was all the sudden over shooting my OG.  I also think it helps to have an actual mash paddle with the holes in the paddle end.  I just have a cheap plastic one, but I'm confident it is way better at breaking up dough balls and generally mixing the grain around.  Also, if all else fails you can just buy another pound of grain or two.  Base malt be mad cheap mate!"

We brew in an apartment and are having one problem, cooling! We are sticking the pot in the sink and running water outside and soaking it, drain and repeat about 3-5 times. Then we fill it and start adding all the ice in the form of frozen bottles and then keep that as cold as possible.  It took a long ass time to chill it.  Question, is there an apartment friendly way to cool the wort? We are thinking of an immersion chiller but it is hard to get in our country but could order. I am quite worried it'll not fit on the sink, how do they typically attach?  Any other genius/interesting ideas on how to cool our wort down?"

The water immediately surrounding the kettle will warm and will take longer to cool. When using an ice bath, I have a large (maybe 75L) plastic bin that I use. You just have to be sure to stir the water (and the wort, unless you're in an environment where wild yeast can come in contact with it, then leave the lid on).

Homebrewing,3dopy3,TheDemonClown,3,Sat Jul 18 06:21:53 2015 UTC,"Nope.. the only thing in suspension is stuff like hop debris and yeast. You put the gelatin in your fermenter, not your bottles. The carbonation occurs when you bottle your beer, or in the keg but that's even less of a problem since it's forced carbonation.  e: I shouldn't say the only thing in suspension. I'm no scientist here, but those are the typical things you are getting out of suspension. It basically makes it so you have a lot less gunk in your bottles and a lot clearer beer."

If it's in a carboy I can see small bubbles coming out of solution sometimes. If you got an OG you can take another reading to see if it's gone down any if you are super worried about it. I wouldn't worry for a few more days though
Homebrewing,3drztx,dokwilson74,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:12:57 2015 UTC,Bucket. I'll check gravity in a couple days. Thanks
Homebrewing,3drztx,danNYtrack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:15:04 2015 UTC,I've had buckets with such a vigorous fermentation that they leaked wort out from the sides of the lid and did not have even one bubble come out of the airlock. Bubbles mean nothing when it comes to buckets. Those lids don't provide the greatest seal all the time.
Homebrewing,3drztx,TheOmnivious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'm also brewing a batch in the bucket that only bubbles when I push down on the lid; meaning that there's a slow leak somewhere else.

Homebrewing,3do0d0,Thatguyaric,26,Sat Jul 18 04:59:14 2015 UTC,"You don't have a blow-off tube on there, you have an airlock. The airlock is the plastic piece stuck into your bung (heh) with water in it. For the first day or so that you are fermenting something that might overflow the carboy, you should have a blow-off tube, which is a length of plastic/silicon/whatever tubing running from your bung to a jug partially filled with water/sanitizer (really you just need water). This will allow all of that extra krausen to overflow into the jug. Your airlock will get clogged and you'll get an explosion that paints your ceiling. If you don't have a tube to do this, take the airlock out and deal with the mess on the floor (I'd recommend placing your carboy on a pile of towels). The pressure from the fermentation will keep anything nasty from getting into your beer. Sanitize your airlock and put it back in tomorrow-ish"

You have a classic case of temperature shock. Now as for solutions it gets tricky. I personally never had a re-pitch work for me. Yeast arent really made to pitch into beer with alcohol present and a gravity that low, they need to activate.   My only sure fire advice on restarting fermentation is to brew another beer with similar yeast, and when that beer is ready and you rack it out of its carboy/bucket/what have you, rack your current stuck beer on top of it. Those yeast will be hungry and healthy while being ready to tolerate your current wort. Its lengthy but is your only guarantee at hitting a closer FG.  how were you gonna carbonate?"

I have a theory as to why they dont work but its a guess: as the acidity in the wort has dropped and the alcohol has become more prevalent, the new starter may still be shocked. the liquid in the starter isnt in the same state as that in the fermentor and yeast are tricky little guys who need to develop and adapt. i'm not a zymurgist so I cant give you the best biological definition unfortunately."
Homebrewing,3drkw3,DUUUVAAALLL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:56:30 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes since. So with that being the case, could you take a bit of the wort from the beer that has stalled, add a bit of DME until it hits .040 and the call that the starter?

If i were to ever been in this situation and try a starter again I'd probably pitch a healthy 1L starter into a carboy and slowly over the course of a few days rack the beer onto the yeast and hope it tempers it. The only fear with this is that theres more chance for oxidation, but hey it'd be a cool experiment. That might be better for trying when you've had a few beers under your belt, and Spacegras is still on his first brew. dealing with starters and try to keep yeast viable in a hostile environment is a little tricky lol"

Always use an airlock or some other air tight blow-off equivalent."

Homebrewing,3drddr,chino_brews,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"The bio-film in the bottles is called a pellicle and is a sign of wild microbe contamination.  Persistent contamination sucks, and the first step in tracking them down is to dispense with all assumptions. For example, you missed your yeast, your thermometer, your stir spoon, your bottling bucket, bottling equipment, bottles, caps, etc. as vectors.  Eliminate each possible vector starting from flameout, is my suggestion.  Best of luck!"
Homebrewing,3drddr,chino_brews,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. it is frustrating because I can taste a great beer, that is just being ruined by off flavors...   The pellicle forms in the fermenter so, I assume it can't be anything to do with bottling equipment (all of which I sanitize anyway). I use dry yeast and sanitize the packet + scissors before opening. I sanitize my thermometer, before using it to check temp before pitching. I can't see anything i'm missing, as anything that touches my wort post boil is sanitized. I'm pretty sure it has to be the lack of an airlock."
Homebrewing,3drddr,chino_brews,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"Well it definitely would start with adding an airlock, and see what happens. I've fermented a lot of beers in an open fermentor, not gotten infections, and ended up with shelf-stable beer.  I know you think you've sanitized x, but I'd do a check on that. The Navy does a standdown when they have an accident, ceasing operations to review basic procedures. It's a good practice for us to do the same.  I'm on mobile so I can't go into detail, but running through a series of brewery tests at each step is a good way to find the vector (wort stability, forced fermentation tests)."
Homebrewing,3drddr,chino_brews,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:17 2015 UTC,"The reason I think it is due to not using an airlock, is because there are a load of tiny fruit flies about (The bar below my flat is full of them).

Here's an excerpt that addresses this:   ...on the spectrum of gastroenterological disorders that can be associated with consumption of certain cereal grains, celiac disease is the only one for which it has been decisively proven that the pathogenic antigen lies within the gluten molecule. If you have a barley allergy, then the antigen of interest is NOT in the gluten molecule, and is not going to be affected AT ALL by Brewer's Clarex. In fact, that's one of the selling points of Brewer's Clarex, that it does not denature the LTP1 protein responsible for head formation. In the case of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, it has not been established which peptides are the culprit in provoking a response, or if it is in fact the gluten that is responsible at all, since grains contain a host of additional proteins."

In the podcast, they were reporting beers to have incredibly low ppm gluten counts. Some tests even came back with unmeasurable results. This far exceeds then FDA standards for being ""Gluten Free."" However, I believe there are some legal implications of this marketing, which state food once containing gluten cannot be marketed as GF. Or perhaps it's a patent roadblock for the product. Regardless, certain breweries use similar gluten-reducing ingredients. Omission Brewing's, for example, test most often come back inconclusive due to strict regulations set on food allergies, but you can be pretty confident there is no measurable amount of gluten in their beer. It's unfortunate that they legally have to include ""may contain gluten"" on their label. Check out their website for test results."

The only treatment for those affected is to avoid foods made with gluten-containing grains.  But there is hope for the beer-loving celiac sufferer.

Need to account for this next time. Ended up mashing around 151-152F.   Hops sucked up a tad of my volume. BS estimated 5.5G post boil...ended up with 4.75G. Yeast starter went all in, bringing me to about 5.25. Not bad.   Efficiency was off a bit...though I'm kind of glad. BS estimated an OG of 1.080 but ended up getting closer to 1.074. This is either due to the massive grain bill, or perhaps older grain? Not too sure...actually. Scratch that. Forgot the pound of corn sugar in the boil. I'm going to add this a day or two into fermentation. Awesome brew day. Most things went to plan. Also bottled a batch and cleaned all of my equipment in about 5 hours. And that's with a 90min boil!

Homebrewing,3dnwv1,tallboybrews,16,Fri Jul 17 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"Hop variety does make a difference for bittering. Some hops are used in certain styles because they are traditional. A brewery would typically use only one type of hop because that is all that was grown in the region. Older styles still reflect this single hop use for bittering and flavoring.    One aspect of hop variety that is often overlooked is the beta acid percentage. When beta acids are isomerized they produce a harsher bitterness, almost an astringent, drying type bitterness that is unpleasant. If a hop is listed as a clean bittering hop it usually means it is higher in alphas and lower in betas. Most of the time the beta percentage is not listed and you can instead focus on the description and alpha acid percentage (ie. dual purpose or bittering only).    Sometimes you will read about Noble hops and these are typically older varieties that have low alpha acids but are balanced between alpha and beta and can be used for both bittering and flavoring. These are more the traditional types of hops that go in older styles of beer."

When you apply a pressure to the inlet on the left it would compress the air in the gap on the right and push the fluid up and to the right. By measuring the difference between the heights of the between the left side and right right you'd be able to calculate the pressure difference between what you're measuring and atmospheric.

In all seriousness, you are correct that higher pressure would inhibit the development of a huge krausen, but it will have very little (if any) effect on the final product. Beer will still happen.

Homebrewing,3dnfcw,KFBass,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:54:40 2015 UTC,"Breweries naturally ferment under much higher pressures because of the hydrostatics from a 30ft tall column of wort. Also I've heard of breweries fermenting in closed circuits, which implies under pressure, for CO2 capture."
Homebrewing,3dnfcw,Mayor_of_tittycity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"Well aware. That's what I do for a living.  Although I don't know many craft breweries who ferment under pressure. And it's certainly higher pressure than an airlock when they do. There are effects from it. But very much not the concern of a homebrewers. We're talking differences in 10 or12 psi on Budweiser level tasting.  Capturing co2 is a different thing, althoguh related. Takes some technogy though. Using it to naturally carb has its own concerns about yeast health."

My beers tend to ferment in about 10-14 days and they have a decent flavor. I was just a bit worried as we my previous setup I use to see some overflow and heavy krausen activity.   Also. I always use a 30 liter spiedel fermenter with 5 gal batches, so there is at least 3 gallons of head volume to avoid overflows. I will try brewing a higher gravity brew next time (~1.070). To see how it behaves. At the end of the day all I care is to have a good beer, wether it has a thick or thin krausen."

What they have focused on instead is to have Serving tools for going to events.  We have two Jocky Boxes that have 8 taps on each (by memory at least) and also a Beer Engine (which is my favorite to use).  Everything is stored at a club leader's house right now but gets moved around depending on events and who is running them.  The larger brew club I am part of, QUAFF, has access to micro-breweries and plenty of other people with equipment. I am not sure what the club itself owns though.

It's called aluminum oxide for a reason, because it's formed when aluminum contacts oxygen and is just basic chemistry :-)  The instant aluminum comes in contact with the air it forms the oxide layer.  Boiling may increase it's thickness, but so as long as you don't go scrubbing the inside of your pot with steel wool while it has wort in it your fine.  You don't  need to season your aluminum pot.

Homebrewing,3dnx8o,TheKevibee,5,Sat Jul 18 01:17:37 2015 UTC,Wort produces dimethyl sulfide (DMS) during the boil. DMS tastes like cooked corn and will mess up the flavor of your beer. Its more of a concern for all grain recipes because most of the DMS is boiled off during the extracting process. It's more of an issue than boil over because it actually changes the beer whereas boil over can only really cause you more of a cleanup.  Edit: It's easier to start now than later. I think its good practice to start with the right methods and avoid any possible variables that could mess up a brew.

When I started, I thought that the time frame from brew day to drinking was just too long, and there was no way I would ever come close to mastering this, but I had fun and I liked the beer I made so I kept at it, and with every batch I learned a little more, and now I feel like I'm becoming an expert (at least about certain things)."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,DarthMaillard,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"The best advice you can get as a newbie brewer is literally the hombrewing mantra:  Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew!  Seriously -- if you get nervous about something, it's probably okay. Give it time.   Also, recipes are great and will help you learn, but even if you screw something up, you can still end up with great beer. (The key is to keep notes on any kind of deviation from the instructions, so that when you inevitably stumble on something awesome, you can recreate it.)"
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,tdangerk,2,Sat Jul 18 00:30:37 2015 UTC,"The instructions that come with most kits are rushing you.  It's done when the gravity is stable for three days (If you don't have a hydrometer: when it stops bubbling + 1 week is what I used to do).  It's carbonated when it's carbonated (and another week or two may very well make it better).    Seriously, don't drink it too soon.  That was my biggest problem.  By the time it was good, I'd have like 12 left."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,sube_fresh,2,Sat Jul 18 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"These are just the things I did when I started:   Keep track of time, set timers and have your ingredients ready to throw in. I lay all of mine out before I start and have my temps and times written down- this is more for when I moved to all grain stuff but I tried to make it a habit from the beginning.  Sanitize sanitize sanitize. My first beer got infected because of a dirty spoon. Never made that mistake again. Sanitize anything that comes in contact with the brew. Don't drink it before it's ready despite wanting to.  I would also move to partial mash as soon as you feel comfortable. Then to AG once the supplies are on hand and you feel confident. I took it as a class so I had the supplies at my disposal and brewed 1 extract, 2 partial mash and then AG from then and I wouldn't move back.  Make beer you want to drink. Extract kits are limiting and that can be a bummer. Once you feel good about your skills look into recipes online or on here. I used BrewToad when I started and found some clone recipes and some more exciting experiments and it offers some decent guidelines to making something balanced. Be careful though, not all of those recipes are going to be solid gold or even good. Which brings me to my next point... Learn about the ingredients. Learn about the different hops, grains, yeast and other add-ins. When you taste a beer you like, note the ingredients and use that to help you find new recipes that have similar profiles or eventually use it to make your own and really branch out. If you want you can just toss some grains in your mouth and chew them.  Don't be intimidated by the process. Every mistake you make is a lesson learned and when you drink your first beer you'll feel proud. Once I made something I felt had some real promise I had friends try it; to hear them say it was good was an awesome feeling.  RELAX and enjoy the experience! I'd drink a beer or two while brewing so I wouldn't get too critical and stand next to the pot watching every bubble. I went from knowing nothing about the process to being able to do AG after a few months. Know the ingredients, know the science and have a good time."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,stanstanstanhagen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"I started with all grain, and wouldn't change it. It's the point most folks get to, so do it early. But yah, relax, have a homebrew! It's the freshest beer ever."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,teamDINGUS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:17:45 2015 UTC,Advice:  1) Sanitize.  Buy Star-San and follow directions online to dilute into a spray bottle.  It's easy and lasts for a while. Also remember that cleaning and sanitizing are two separate processes   2) Yeast.  Make sure you are pitching enough yeast.  Use the calculator on mrmalty.com As you are just beginning doing a yeast starter might be more than you want to commit to which means that you might be looking at 2 vials of white labs yeast for each batch.  Some people will say thats not necessary but the biggest problem I had for the first 2 years of homebrewing was underattentuation which results in that stupid sweet homebrewy taste.  Once I focused on proper pitching rates with yeast nutrients my beer changed totally for the better.   3) Buy John Palmers How to Brew.  You can read the first few chapters which are perfect for beginners but you can utilize the book for years as you advance with the later chapters.    4) Have fun.

Homebrewing,3dnx8o,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:51:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, good habit to get into and all, but with extract just need to make sure you have the right amount of liquid in the fermenter. The sugar content won't change."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,Fenix159,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"True, but even if it's not necessarily required for extract doesn't mean it should be skipped over.  But to each their own."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:12 2015 UTC,"Well the problem with gravity readings when doing extract is that a lot of people get either super high or super low readings and freak out.  Reality is the sample wasn't fully mixed, which isn't a big deal.  Taking a sample to measure is good practice, long as one understands that is a very real possibility when doing extract."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,Fenix159,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:53:04 2015 UTC,"Even with the freaking out, an extract brewer should still take a gravity reading so, like you said, they can see if the OG is too high or too low.  That way they can try and troubleshoot what they did wrong and apply it to the next brew."
Homebrewing,3dnx8o,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"But if the gravity is too high or too low, they likely didn't do anything wrong. That's my point.  If the sample isn't properly mixed, you can try to mix it better next time. But is it really worthwhile to mix more? Not really, because the gravity isn't going to actually be different.  Doing it to build the habit if you plan to go all grain at any point is great. Otherwise, meh. Know your volumes and how much extract went in and you know your gravity."
Homebrewing,3dpfs3,the_chandler,5,Sat Jul 18 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"The only honey flavor you'll taste is the flavor you trick yourself into tasting. All that shit is gonna ferment right out. Yeah you'll get more alcohol - whoop-de-do, you'll have a bland, more alcoholic drink. Might as well buy some 40s.    You want a good blonde ale? Try again. Get Brewing Classic Styles and try that recipe. If crystal malt in a blonde isn't your thing, try 80% 2-row, 20% Vienna malt. Hop lightly to 15-20 IBUs. Ferment clean with WLP001, temp control and a yeast starter.    Throwing honey into your fermentor isn't going to turn a mediocre beer into something more."

Homebrewing,3dpfs3,TheReverend5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"If it were me? I'd package it, taste it after carbonation, decide if it was worth drinking, and then either drink it or dump it. I dislike trying to ""save"" beer, and I prefer to just brew a beer again and try to make it better the next time around.    If you really want to try to save it, you could boil up some more concentrated extract wort and add it to the fermentor if there's room in the fermentor. You'd have to use a recipe calculator to figure out how much DME you'd need to boil up and add, if it would need hops, etc... Seems like a huge hassle imo, and I don't think it's really worth the extra effort when you could just brew a new batch instead."
Homebrewing,3dpfs3,Thatguyaric,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:42:31 2015 UTC,"Dumping it isn't even thought. It's not that its bad at all. It's just not as strong as I'd like, and it's a little light on flavor."
Homebrewing,3dpfs3,TheReverend5,2,Sun Jul 19 04:55:43 2015 UTC,"Honey is highly HIGHLY fermentable, so you won't get much in the way of ""honey"" flavor; maybe a strong twang in the finish.   Never put it in the secondary myself, but why not?"

Homebrewing,3dmtu3,Alittleshorthanded,-3,Fri Jul 17 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"Your prices are way off...  I built almost this exact kegerator for 250 bucks ( with better faucets).  That fridge was 139, the tower with Perlick faucets was 120.  Fridge was on Amazon with Prime, so no shipping costs there.  The other parts you are close, The regulator there is a single split regulator, the one pictured pictured is 50 bucks.  Mine is a true dual for 99 bucks, so I can have different pressure in each keg, but whatever.  I picked up my 2 used ball lock kegs for 35 a piece (not converted pin locks, they don't fit in that fridge).  CO 2 tanks are a waste of money to buy, since most places will not refill them, just exchange.  Overall, this guy is paying basically the same price for a used kegerator that it would cost to build the exact same one himself brand new.  Without the CO2 tank it would cost him around 380 for everything.  Deposit on an initial tank is 40 bucks at my local LHBS, then 20 for each exchange.  It all depends if he wants to spend the time to do to himself.  That particular fridge has no coolant lines in the top, so drilling a hole is very easy.  Not to mention there is no freezer, and the cooling element is already on the back.  Inside panel is put on with screws, so easy to take off and replace as well.  Holesaw drilling a hole, 4 holes for the bolts, it is done.  That build with that fridge takes 30 min.  Is that worth a used kegerator?"

You don't really need a lot of this stuff and can brew good beer without all the bells and whistles but hey, if you have the money I say go for it!  I agree, the bottle washer isn't very necessary. I would also have one of the ""crappy plastic buckets"" filled with sanitizer water near by. Those buckets are really useful. You can keep stuff in it until you need it, like the spoon, carboy brush, auto siphon & airlocks. Or if you drop something you can toss it in the bucket to cleanse.  Be careful with the glass carboy though, I've dropped a plastic one from only ~8"" up and I fear what would've happened had it been glass.  Edit: Because I replied to the wrong comment."

The strain is from Brasserie Blaugies and gives a nice citrus flavor but with a slightly tart peppery finish to the beer. Ferments well and isn't finicky like WY3724 (Dupont) while producing a nice saison.  Side Note: Off Color Brewing used this yeast in ""Apex Predator"". I would suggest picking up a 4-pack if they distro in your area. One of my favorite american saisons."

It makes a beer that's very dry with high attenuation, but it retains some nice mouthfeel. It's got some spicy phenolics. Throw it into a fairly simple grain bill and it shines.  However, my experience with saisons is that it is not ideal to keep them hot all through fermentation. They're best starting off in the 60s, then gradually rising until they're finishing at hotter temperatures. This is true for Belgian strong ale yeasts as well. I'd advise plunking it into a swamp cooler for the first several days and using ice packs to keep it cool for a bit, then letting it free rise."

Then people were asked their preference. I did this with 2 different recipes  WL 550 came out on top for every single person, including myself (15 in total).

The Yeast Bay Dry Belgian is another contender, I've only used it once but it had a great peppery taste and amazing silky body given how much it attenuated.  If you're willing to dabble in the dark arts of funky beers I'm a big fan of wlp670 american farmhouse. A nice tart flavor with some brett funk to it."

So far, for a single yeast, I prefer WLP590 (because so far it produced the most pepper).  I've also used 3724, WLP565, and a blend of those two.  Next up will be Belle Saison.  One of the cool things about saison is how yeast-dependent it is.  That makes the rest of the recipe essentially whatever you want to do.  In mine, I add a handful of flaked wheat.  I'm wondering if 5lbs of flaked (unmalted) wheat is a typo, because having a base malt as less than half of your grain bill seems like it may be problematic.

It's not a magic bullet, but every bit helps. The other pro tip is to put some glass beads, marbles, or marble-sized SS ball bearings in your boil at the start (same time as Fermcap) -- they provide nucleation points for gas, and helps prevent small bubbles closer to the surface. Other techniques include spray bottle of water or star-san solution to spray to knock down rising foam, dropping a few ice cubes in to rapidly chill that one degree you need, and stirring.  And yes, you can remove the kettle from the coil. If the boil stops for a few minutes, you don't need to pause the clock as long as the wort stays above around 200°F, although it's a good idea to stir a little from time to time to move wort if it stays below boiling for a while."

Homebrewing,3dm73x,rayfound,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:55 2015 UTC,I'll speak for the silent majority and say - I'm highly skeptical it is a regulator issue.   If you really want to eliminate it as a possibility - you could put hepa filters inline on your co2 lines.

Homebrewing,3dm73x,AbandonedTrilby,2,Fri Jul 17 22:16:19 2015 UTC,"Ball locks are more commonly used by homebrewers, but are more expensive. Pin locks are ever so slightly harder to find parts for (everyone assumes ball lock), but you get the advantage of knowing for sure that the connection is secure. With ball lock, there is a chance it could look and feel secure but not actually be attached fully.  Most people commit to one or the other.  Some people do both, especially if they are dedicating a set to sour beer."

Homebrewing,3dm73x,holybarfly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"A different approach I take than oldsock's is to make one wort for the total volume you will need (to save on time), then do your first step. Reserve the remainder in a sealed and sanitized jug/jar and refrigerate. Crash for a day after the first step is fermented out, then raise back to room temp and pitch the remaining starter wort, and repeat."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,oldsock,4,Fri Jul 17 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"Despite what pitching rate calculators suggest, you really won’t get much growth from stepping up a starter without increasing the volume by much. To get exponential growth yeast really need lots of free room. What you want to do is make the biggest start you can, let it ferment out, and settle. Move 80% of the yeast to the fridge to store, and make another starter with the remaining 20%. When that is done, pitch both into the beer!"

The target OG was 1.055, but it hit about 1.061.

Homebrewing,3dm73x,everdayisbrewday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"You can leave it and have a higher ABV of beer, or add water and get more beer. Either is fine. Bothe will be tasty.

Homebrewing,3dm73x,chino_brews,3,Fri Jul 17 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"I'd advise against adding boiled water at this stage. I use to give different advice, but I've since learned to consider the fact that your water (even if boiled) will contain enough O2 to have oxidative effects on your beer. The commercial brewers have special equipment to deoxygenate water for when they dilute their beers. You can deoxygenate water using a slaked lime method (you can look it up), but your beer is close enough and should be fine. It won't be syrupy at 1.061, and I doubt you will be able to tell the difference from six gravity points."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,laxpulse,0,Fri Jul 17 18:21:23 2015 UTC,Yes you can if you chill it down to the appropriate temps as well. Alternatively you can just use Star Sar and bypass the boiling part altogether. Is your primary concern the gravity of the batch or the volume?
Homebrewing,3dm73x,flapjackcarl,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:20 2015 UTC,What? No. Starsan is a no rinse sanitizer. What's left behind isn't dangerous. But adding 1.5 gallons of an acidic solution to beer that has already fermented is definitely not advisable
Homebrewing,3dm73x,laxpulse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Can you cite why it isn't advisable? I'm not saying that I don't believe you, I'm just curious what the effects are."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,flapjackcarl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:52:34 2015 UTC,I don't have a direct citation. It's no rinse because the residue left behind is so dilute inside 5 gallons of beer. When you add 1 5 gallons you're putting g a significant amount of phosphoric acid in your beer. It likely wouldn't cause any I'll effects but it's definitely not something I'd be comfortable doing.  I'd also expect it to impart negative flavor
Homebrewing,3dm73x,laxpulse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"I dont disagree with adding a concentration large enough to sanitize 5 gallons, that would be overkill and potentially hazardous to the yeast.

Homebrewing,3dm73x,bluelinebrewing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"You're talking about making more than 25% of a batch of beer StarSan solution.

If we're arguing this based on proper dilution for pints, we'd be adding 0.025floz... and I would be very surprised if it was even noticeable.

Homebrewing,3dm73x,flapjackcarl,0,Mon Jul 20 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"There are times when I'm willing to accept anecdotal evidence. Perhaps this happened to several people with no I'll effects. Bully for them. This does not mean I'm ever going to add 1.5 gallons of an acid solution to my beer intentionally. Additionally, those beers were fermenting. This beer is 6 days in and is likely mostly done with active fermentation. As a result I'd imagine the yeast would be less likely to work cleanup. Again: is it unsafe? Doubtful. Would I willingly add it to my beer when I could boil some water, or better yet  leave it as is? Absolutely not"
Homebrewing,3dm73x,BH_Quicksilver,2,Sat Jul 18 00:31:15 2015 UTC,"My primary concern is that the beer will turn out too thick, or too much like a syrup, and won't be drinkable. Is this an unnecessary concern?"

Its inspired by a local brewery who brewed a Dark Cherry mild  for a beer festival I was at earlier in the year.   I've just collect a ton of cherrys from my girlfriends cherry tree. I've been unable to find many cherry mild recipes (quite a few ruby milds however). So I've settled on  this recipe.  Any tips to preparing the fruit? I've got to freeze them until next week before I can brew.  Also any recipes or suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you

It was my 2nd all grain batch so I'm still figuring some things out, but I could sure use some wisdom.  After vorlaufing something like 2 gallons, I started lautering to make room for sparge water. Almost immediately I got a stuck sparge. I'm confused as to why this happened, because I milled my grains at my LHBS with their nice mill set on their primary setting, and it was just a SMaSH grain bill of 9 lbs pale ale, which shouldn't cause a thick wort to my knowledge. Also, I mashed at a thin 2 qts/lb. I was thinking perhaps I vorlaufed too hard (ran it wide open for ~2 gallons) and sucked the grain bed down.  Has this happened to anyone else? Any tips would be extremely appreciated."

It is a very delicate flavor that works in a varietal mead, but I would think would be overpowered by the chocolate and roast malts. It will ferment out completely.

Are there any indications on the honey of how they add raspberry flavour? Does it get mixed with actual raspberries, or perhaps they use a flavour syrup."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,campl0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"hmm I wish I could answer, but I cant.  My brew partner LOVES honey and raspberry so I thought we could do something more his style this time around.  He gets the honey from the local farmers market and I have yet to try it.    From what I started reading, honey will increase the abv and almost completely ferment out.  I guess if I really wanted that raspberry to show, i should just use real ones."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,jmwo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"The sugars in the honey will certainly ferment out. I can't comment on whether the raspberry flavour in the honey would or not. If you use the honey, worst thing that happens is you get no raspberry flavour and it behaves like normal honey otherwise, so as long as the honey as an addition is taken into account, I don't see any issues with using it. :)"

Googling indicates a blonde or brown ale would be well suited, so I thought a Flanders Red recipe would be appropriate. Came up with oldsock's wine barrel red.  Do you think this is a good choice?  Also, the impression I get is that hop flavour/aroma isn't really suitable for Brett beers because the hop conflicts with the funk (or fades with the aging). Given that a 100% Brett beer should be cleaner than ""Brett secondary fermented"" beers, what are your opinions on some aroma hops at flameout?"
Homebrewing,3dm73x,oldsock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"I guess the question is what are you hoping the result will be? 100% Brett will result in a very different beer without the acidity of a standard Flemish Red.   You can certainly do a hoppy 100% Brett beer, because of the comparatively quick turnaround. I've had a few 100% Brett IPAs I've really enjoyed. My favorite was with Trois, but it turns out that isn't Brett at all. The issue is more with hop bitterness clashing with acidity. Brett and hop aromatics can be very pleasant together.  Best of luck!"

Rather then bottle condition I really enjoy the ease of force carbing in a keg and bottling via counter pressure filler. This allows me to dial in the carbonation easily. Also I enjoy drinking some of the batch, bottling whatever I feel like (typically half or a little more), and finishing the keg on tap. I really get familiar with what I made this way and have some stashed for further development.  My question is regarding the lack of true bottle conditioning. Will my bottles this way still develop and age like a bottle conditioned counterpart? I should still have bacteria and yeast in the bottles i would assume. And as long as my beer was at terminal should have no points dropping and no over carbed bottle bombs. I will miss the bottle refermentation but from what I understand a lot of commercial beers are refermented with wine or champagne yeast. So it's not like the brett or the bugs are responsible for this bottle carbonation.   Any thoughts/input on this. I like this process but want to know if its going to effect how these age down the road."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,oldsock,4,Fri Jul 17 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"I talked to Remi Bonnart for ASB, and that's how he did the Flemish Red he won brewer of the year with in 2010.  If bottling off the keg is done well (minimal O2 pickup) you should get good development in the bottles. The one thing you're missing is much autolysis in the bottle. Usually as the Sacch dies it releases fatty acids and some sugars that the Brett can play with. Likely your beer will be slightly cleaner than a true bottle conditioned beer."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,AbandonedTrilby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"So I have a beer that I forgot about for a year. It's been sitting on the yeast that whole time.

I wouldn't be doing any of this stuff without your blog over the years and then the fantastic book.  Is this the calvados soaked oak aged Flanders mentioned in your book?  The lack of autolysis may actually be a benefit in my case, I'm bottling most of these in normal 12 oz bottles and the additional carbonation may be undesired.  Has anyone had problems with 12 oz bottles and 3.5 vol carb level?  I'm really interested in this for a beer that will be finishing soon.  It's a quick lacto sour, fermented with dirty dozen brett with monterency concentrate in the secondary.

Consumption of lysed yeast by other yeast is not a fermentative metabolism, so I'm guessing that material amounts of CO2 wouldn't be produced by that activity -- certainly the scale would be much lower than fermenting sugar per gram. And then when you consider that the grams of lysed yeast in a bottle is so small compared to the grams of priming sugar in a typical bottle-conditioned bottle..."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,oldsock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:29 2015 UTC,Exactly.   I've had very few bottles blow despite a couple very over-carbonated beers. It may be tricky getting a beer with that much CO2 into the bottles without foaming though.   Just kegged a quick soured beer with a Dirty Dozen primary and loads of apricot puree. Saved a gallon without fruit to get a better sense of the Brett contribution.  Hope it turns out well!
Homebrewing,3dm73x,shemrahboo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:39:43 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for your post on that beer.  When I saw you brewed something like that it was very coincidental timing because I did the exact thing pretty much.  Will you be bottling any off the keg to see how it progresses or just cold conditioning in the keg the whole time?  Or just bottling that 1 gallon portion?  I'm probably going to bottle roughly half+ of the batch and then just drink the keg, a beer like this gets devoured by guests quite rapidly.  Dirty dozen in the bottles hopefully will do its magic."

Homebrewing,3dm73x,chino_brews,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"Besides the other suggestions, I'm not sure I'd take the judge's comments as gospel. Irish Reds are supposed to be balanced with a slight tilt toward maltiness, not malt forward. The results you get from comps vary, and it's not unusual for a beer to get varying scores and comments (although top beers entered in multiple competitions tend to have scores averaging or clustering where they belong).  Along with your water adjustments, maybe try rebrewing the recipe with a properly-sizied pitch of liquid Irish Ale yeast, and ferment it on the cool side of the yeast's optimal range (using beer temp, not ambient temp)?"
Homebrewing,3dm73x,mrthedon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:25 2015 UTC,Thanks. I only entered in 1 competition so that's certainly possible.  And yes I use beer temp (probe attached to carboy w/insulation around it)

Homebrewing,3dm73x,oldsock,2,Fri Jul 17 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"If that's the beer temperature (not the ambient), then you're fine. Time to try Irish ale (or American ale) around there or even a couple degrees cooler if you can."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,Broham13,3,Fri Jul 17 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"I assume you meant 8oz CaraBelge, not 8lbs.   I would go with changing yeast.   I would also consider looking at water chemistry. If you never have, take a look at the first few pages of this primer."

Homebrewing,3dm73x,StraydogQD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:00:14 2015 UTC,I was a bit too late for the Wednesday round table (damn time zones) so I'll try my luck here. I am planning to brew an Orange Wheat on Sunday and want to add some orange juice (maybe 1.5 litres) at flame out. How will this affect the gravity? Do I just measure like with other beer? Or are there other calculations involved to calculate the final ABV? I don't plan any other additions after that (no secondary). Thanks!
Homebrewing,3dm73x,Broham13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:33:12 2015 UTC,Have you tried this before or get the idea somewhere? I've heard from multiple sources that fermented orange juice is repulsive. Can anyone confirm?
Homebrewing,3dm73x,StraydogQD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:07:09 2015 UTC,I haven't tried this before but saw it in a few recipes. I want to avoid adding fruit during or after the fermentation to avoid any risk of infection. I hope that by adding a bit of juice and orange peel I can save some of the orange flavour without having to add any fruit. Has anyone else tried this way?
Homebrewing,3dm73x,Broham13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:34 2015 UTC,Zest should be enough without needing juice. Just avoid the pithy white stuff.
Homebrewing,3dm73x,AdamTheMechE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"Nothing in the orange juice would interfere with measuring gravity the usual way.  Just make sure it's well incorporated!  Also, I've heard that the zest does a much better job at delivering citrus flavor.  That, or using citrus-heavy hops.  Here's something I typed up for using lemon zest, but I would imagine it would work just as well for orange!  Start steeping the (clean) zest of 6 lemons in 1 ball jar of vodka or everclear today. Brew as normal with no lemon. Taste a day before bottling. Do you think it needs lemon? Strain some lemon vodka into a small sample to get the ratio right, then slowly try to scale that up to your large bucket. If it turns out to be tasty without the lemon, great! Make a simple syrup with 1.5 cups water and 1.25 cups sugar, add it to your lemon vodka, and you've got limoncello. Usually, however, people can get decent citrus results with hops, no lemon needed."

Wanted to give plenty of time for starter to finish, plus a good cold crash, per my normal routine.  I put the starter in the fridge yesterday at noon, and as of this morning, it is still very cloudy, and not much yeast floc'd out.  I'm assuming this is typical of a Belgian strain? (this is my first time using a Belgian strain; usually use WLP001 exclusively)  I don't want to decant off a bunch of viable yeast, so would you just pitch the entire 2L starter into your Belgian witbier, or would you still decant and pitch just the small layer of floc'd out yeast at the bottom?"
Homebrewing,3dm73x,flapjackcarl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:57:47 2015 UTC,You'll get a fair amount of flocculation throughout the day today. Another option is to brew and chill tonight? Pitch yeast tomorrow morning. I've done this on occasion due to difficulties cooling with no I'll effects.
Homebrewing,3dm73x,tuesdayswithboner,3,Fri Jul 17 15:54:20 2015 UTC,If I have room in my carbon I just pitch the whole thing. 2 L in 5 gallons doesn't really affect it to me.
Homebrewing,3dm73x,turduckenpillow,2,Fri Jul 17 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"I always decant off because I'd rather not have 1-2L of unhopped DME beer in my 1-2 gallon batch.  Personal preference.

Homebrewing,3dm73x,DICKERBEER,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"For beers using lager yeast, usually you ferment in the low 50s followed by a diacetyl rest for 2-3 days before lagering. My question is what would be the effects of leaving the diacetyl rest for longer say 1-2 weeks. I would guess not too much since it would likely already be at or close to FG but I just was curious if anyone had any thoughts on this."
Homebrewing,3dm73x,bluelinebrewing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:59:09 2015 UTC,"I've done that several times, for instance when I need to ferment an ale during the lager's d-rest, and that goes longer than I expected.  It's fine, just don't count the extra time towards your lagering period.  Lagering isn't really magical, it's just extended cold conditioning.  All you're doing is delaying the start of cold conditioning."

Homebrewing,3doasd,lowlyf,5,Fri Jul 17 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"I never remove the airlock for cold crashing. Just make sure it's only filled to the fill line, or use the S type airlocks and you won't have a problem."

Homebrewing,3doasd,SpyderFoode,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:43 2015 UTC,I use 3-piece filled with starsan and never have an issue.  I usually wrap them in sanitized foil before crashing just for good measure (though I'm sure this is most likely not necessary)
Homebrewing,3doasd,chino_brews,4,Fri Jul 17 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"There are different approaches.  Some leave the airlock in. With 3-piece airlocks you can get suckback of the airlock fluid, but with S-shaped ones the intruding air will generally bubble through. It is a myth that any sanitizer can sanitize air bubbling through it, though.  Others replace the airlock with a solid bung, but the risk with PET carboys is that the negative pressure will cause your carboys to cave in a little (and if you warm them up, the expanding headspace will cause the carboy to pop back out and disturb the sediment). Even if you remove the bung when cold and package from there, you run the risk of air intrusion, and ""popback"" on PET carboys.  Personally, I use 3-piece airlocks and replace the bell/cradle/middle piece with layers of sterile gauze (or a cut unscented tampon or maxipad in a pinch). I mostly eliminate the contamination issue, while recognizing the fact that oxidation is an issue. I feel like this is a ""Chino original"", although I acknowledge it was inspired by a slightly different solution by one of my homebrew heroes."
Homebrewing,3doasd,TurboS40,2,Fri Jul 17 22:45:54 2015 UTC,I haven't used an airlock on any of my last 20 or so batches. Tinfoil FTW.
Homebrewing,3doasd,neiltheseal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:36:20 2015 UTC,"Do you think this affects the flavour in any way? I've heard it can for beers such as Hefeweizens, but haven't tried it just yet."
Homebrewing,3doasd,TurboS40,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"Nope. I should point out that I'm fermenting in a single (""primary"") vessel only, for a maximum of 3 weeks. For anything longer, or anything necessitating a transfer to a second vessel, I'd consider using one of the many airlocks I have kicking around.   During fermentation a carboy is pressurized, so unless something falls in, you don't have much to worry about. While an airlock provides cheap insurance, myself and a lot of brewers I know have stopped using them altogether without ill effects. And during cold crashing, I don't worry a whole lot about air getting in because finished beer isn't a very hospitable environment for bacteria."
Homebrewing,3doasd,dingleberrymoustache,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:04:13 2015 UTC,"When using my better bottles, I remove the blow-off and orange stopper, and replace it with a 1x1' sheet of tinfoil folded into quarters (dipped in starsan). This prevents the carboy from caving in. There should be enough carbon-dioxide in the head space to avoid oxidation. I have yet to have any problems in ~200 batches."

Homebrewing,3dm73z,PhlegmPhactory,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:30 2015 UTC,My plan is to take the spear out and stretch one of those orange carboy caps over the top.  I have a better bottle with one of those caps that has a piece of silicone tubing connected to the underside of the port used for starting the sterile siphon and dips down into the beer.  I take the airlock off and pump CO2 into that hole to push samples out of the other side without disturbing the beautiful pellicle or introducing O2.
Homebrewing,3dm73z,qwfpjluy,2,Fri Jul 17 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"I've often heard the story that Saison is brewed for the field workers and brewed in the winter and stored until summer time. So that is why it was made hoppy in order to preserve it.  See page 11 of Farmehouse Ales by Phil Markowski:   For farmhouse brewers, the cold winter months were spent building a stock of ""provision beer"" to drink during the rest of the year. Since the brewing season was shorter than usual these ales needed to remain relatively stable in flavor during long-term storage.   Also note, average temperatures in Belgium in winter are just above freezing.  I'm experiencing a bit of cognitive dissidence when I combine all of that with common home brewing knowledge that you should ferment Saison strains really warm, up to 90F. (After starting them at a cooler 67-70 and letting them ramp up.)  The average high in the middle of summer is only 73F in Brussels!   Can anyone explain?"
Homebrewing,3dm73z,Uberg33k,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"Take this with a boulder sized grain of salt, but I think you're misinterpreting what he said here.  I think he's describing Biere de Garde, not Saison.  Saisons would have been made during the sowing and harvest periods to feed the farmhands and provide them with hydration.  They'd use whatever grains they had handy at the time, possibly throw in herbs and roots if they were thought to boost strength and endurance, and add hops to prevent spoilage (it's hot).  They were drunk right away.  They didn't really age them out too much.  Biere de Garde was made after the harvest for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, it's a hedge.  If spring came and they had no grain to make beer, this beer would still be good.  It  also served somewhat of a function as storage.  Heck of a lot easier to turn your crop to beer than it is to store grain and keep the pests out of it.  There's also the winter warmer effect as something to help fend off the chill.  That doesn't hurt either."
Homebrewing,3dm73z,qwfpjluy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, I suppose he could be referring to Bier de Garde. What you are saying makes sense, but then in Yvan De Baets essay he states:   Saisons were brewed at the beginning of winter in a farmhouse brewery in order to quench the thirst of the farmhands who worked in the fields in the summer. The saisons that were brewed in the winter had to survive the spring without becoming too infected. Sometimes these beers were called saisons d'ete or summer saisons.   Further down he states a similar idea:   Brewing saisons also served to provide work for the year-round workers in the winter, and to produce spent grain that served as quality feed for livestock.   Which makes sense.. because the livestock couldn't graze as much in the winter... but doesn't make much sense as to the fermentation temperatures."
Homebrewing,3dm73z,Uberg33k,2,Fri Jul 17 14:12:28 2015 UTC,"I guess there's some interpretation to be made there as well.  I guess if it's late winter/early spring and you're making beer for the sowing  and planting season, I could buy that.  I just don't see how you're making a 3% beer in January and having enough to last till through harvest in September or October with no refrigeration, especially when you have saisonniers drinking up to 5L a day.  Brewing was done throughout the year with the exception of when it was exceptionally cold or hot.  If they were brewing all at once, then you'd be subject to stalling (because it's too cold) and spoilage, even at a higher hopping rate.  This might actually make sense if part of the original process was a secondary Brett fermentation.  They could pitch a Sacc yeast in the winter and let it do whatever it could, then it would stall out until the warmer months when Brett would finish it off and dry it out.  That could be where part of the lore of warm fermentation comes from.  Certainly part of it comes from Saison Dupont because they ferment very warm.  The problem is I don't think you'll ever get a real definitive answer.  Farms didn't really keep records and every farm did things a little differently.  I think you'll need to recenter your thinking to find saisons.  Saisons are about terroir and refreshment.  Make a saison out of whatever is local.  Use the local yeast on those ingredients.  They were using koelschips, so a mixed fermentation would be key.  Let it age out to see where it ends up.  I think as long as you're low ABV, it's dry, and a refreshing drink when it's hot outside, you've found your saison.  Edit: Actually, /u/drewbage1847 should just stop by and tell us what's really up."

Looking forward to turn some of my extract/partial mash recipies into all grain ones. going to learn the systems by helping out with a couple brews, but does any one have any general advice for conversion of recipies? i am using mostly czech light malt extract (liquid), any idea what kind of base malt i should be using to replace it?"
Homebrewing,3dm73z,TheRealFender,2,Fri Jul 17 12:26:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say Pilsner malt to replace that LME. Maybe regular 2-row, but most likely Pilsner.  The max gravity points you'll get from regular base malt is about 37. At 75% efficiency, you'll get about 28 points. A pound of DME will get you about 44 gravity points and LME will yield about 36.  So 1 pound of DME should be replaced w/ about 44 / 28 = 1.57 pounds of grain. And 1 pound of LME should be replaced w/ about 36 / 28 = 1.29 pounds of grain.

Homebrewing,3dm73z,TheRealFender,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:00 2015 UTC,"Per gallon, sorry.  But the volume units should cancel out, so just sub 1.57 kg of grain for 1 kg of DME, etc."

That opened April 12, 2014. We have 11 available taps, but due to production restrictions of a nano we typically have 6-8 beers available.   Being on the west coast, we focus on big hoppy IPAs, but also, Tommy grew up farming and has a close tie with that community, so we also focus on farmhouse styles. Typically we have at least one saison on and our seasonal Smoked Jalepeno Saison (Dragon Juice!) is a fan favorite in the summer. We also serve a few excellent stouts  (Coco crusader with chocolate and Zealous with coffee).  No packaged beer (aside from growlers) is available yet, but that is a goal of this current expansion.

Homebrewing,3dinoi,necropaw,7,Thu Jul 16 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"I'll have to check, but I think a 30bbl tank is somewhere between 15-20k..."
Homebrewing,3dinoi,necropaw,7,Thu Jul 16 18:36:51 2015 UTC,It's remarkable that a hollow tank can cost about as much as a small vehicle.

Homebrewing,3dinoi,QuaSiMoDO_652,3,Thu Jul 16 19:37:35 2015 UTC,Particularly the stainless variety.  Not to mention the time and effort it takes to weld one of those things.
Homebrewing,3dinoi,QuaSiMoDO_652,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:28 2015 UTC,Especially if those welds are to spec.  Add the word food safe and that pretty much doubles the cost.

At that volume you could keep your entire family pretty well stocked with beer."
Homebrewing,3dinoi,blocher86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:45:37 2015 UTC,The small steps were not too bad. I don't recall the prices but our first 3BBL tank was pretty reasonable. The prices go up pretty quick on the jacketed ones too.

Homebrewing,3do0ck,wees1750,2,Sat Jul 18 00:17:51 2015 UTC,I would leave it in. No sense in accidentally burning yourself when you can just take it out after you transfer the cooled wort to your fermenter.
Homebrewing,3do0ck,tallboybrews,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:03:45 2015 UTC,"Is there an issue with leaving the wort hot for too long with boil (or steeping) hops in the kettle? One of my batches currently fermenting was put in an ice bath to partially cool and then I had to go out, so the temp wasn't brought down much at all for about two hours."
Homebrewing,3do0ck,Fenix159,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:57:09 2015 UTC,The issue would be longer exposure time at higher temperatures resulting in more bitterness and less flavor/aroma.
Homebrewing,3do0ck,EskimoDave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:16:08 2015 UTC,"You'll continue to extract some more bitterness (not much, but it can be noticeable).  It really comes down to your brewing process and what your goals are."
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,grohlier,5,Fri Jul 17 14:58:05 2015 UTC,I've put Jalapenos in Blonde Ales and not had problems with carbonation. They do muck with the head retention though. I used two (seeds removed) in the boil and 2 (whole/quartered/lightly roasted) as 'dry peppers' 3 days before bottling in a 5 gallon batch. Works well for me.

Homebrewing,3dmpjt,Metaldwarf,5,Fri Jul 17 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"I've done a few pepper beers. Adding the peppers to the boil will result in vegetal flavors and won't be what you are looking for.  What has worked best for me is roasting split peppers until they are soft and a little charred, this seems to enhance their fruity flavors. Peel off the skins and any black char. Soak the roasted peppers in a jar of vodka for about a week or two. At packaging time SLOWLY add an oz or two of the tincture, stir, taste, adjust.   I have found that 2-3 oz of habanero tincture will be enough to spice up a 5 gallon batch. Stop before you get to the level you want, once carbonated the heat will be stronger."
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,Metaldwarf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:45:11 2015 UTC,"By ""packaging time"" do you mean bottling/kegging?    Define ""spice up."" I don't want to set anyone's mouth ablaze when they try my beer!    Also, for my learning style, you paint a very easy to follow picture of how to do this. Thanks a lot!"
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,rocky6501,2,Fri Jul 17 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"Packaging means kegging or bottling. Add the tincture after the fermentation is done and the beer is nearly ready.    I usually do about 6 split and de-seeded habanero peppers that I roast under the broiler in my oven. Peel the skins, clean up any burnt charred bits and then soak in Vodka.   I'm not usually out to make a really spicy beer where your mouth is burning and you need to chug a glass of milk after drinking the beer. I usually just want a little tingle, similar to what you get from carbonation. If there is a bit of heat on the finish that is ok too but I am not after something to blow your face off.   I find that 2-3oz of tincture is a good level of ""tingle"" with maybe a touch of heat on the finish. If you went for 4-6oz you are going to have a ""hot"" beer. Hence the advice to slowly add a bit at a time, stir it into the keg or bottling bucket, and have a taste, then add a little more and taste until you think it is about right. I also find the carbonation will make the heat seem hotter once bottled or kegged, so error on the side of caution stop when you think you are a little short of where you want it heat wise."
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,jwalkermed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:06:11 2015 UTC,Awesome. You've got me so hyped about this.    Since I've never made a tincture... how much vodka do you add to your solution?
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,emok66,2,Fri Jul 17 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"Enough to cover, I usually use a 250ml jam jar. Toss in the roasted peppers and fill till they are covered. Vodka is an effective sanitizer as well, so you don't need sanitize or worry about infections using the tincture.  The tincture works great for mixed drinks (Caesars)  and cooking as well."
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,WonkoTheSane4242,2,Fri Jul 17 19:49:37 2015 UTC,"Capsaicin should not hurt the yeast. Its actually not a toxic or harmful compound. The burning/pain it causes is a complete ""illusion."" It messes with nerve signals by causing nerves that are specialized in heat detection to go haywire, tricking your body into thinking it is getting burned but there is no actual fire.  Yeast don't have these nerve cells. I think only certain higher animals do, excluding birds. I would posit that it is therefore not going to 'burn' or hurt yeast, barring any other mechanism of toxicity that is unique to yeast.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin#Mechanism_of_action"
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,bovineblitz,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:28 2015 UTC,what I've done in the past is make a vodka extract withthe pepper and added it at packaging to taste.  Very controllable that way.  I deseeded and roasted the peppers first.   I know some add them after fermentation and taste periodically then package when it's ready.  More than one way to skin a cat.
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,Ainjyll,2,Fri Jul 17 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, adding them to the secondary under controlled times is the way to go. For my habanero wit, I use 6 pods, rinsed in StarSan and then cut 4 * 3/4"" slits in the sides. Usually I'll only keep them in for a day at most as I've found that any more time leads to undesirable flavors. Scotch Bonnets should be the same. This yields a spicy beer that doesn't leave people gasping."
Homebrewing,3dmpjt,BH_Quicksilver,2,Fri Jul 17 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"I made a chipotle pepper porter before that came out pretty tasty. I only needed a few peppers as I make small batches.

As I have drawn off the carboy over the last few months, the flavoring has only intensified, almost to the point where it is a strong jalapeño taste, as well as a very warming drink. It is best drank in winter now, as it is pretty intense.  The yeast is still fermenting a year and a half later after sitting in all the capsacin goodness."

Are you happy with the 2-row you've been using? Get that. If you want to step up to something a bit better than your standard 2-row, see if you can get Golden Promise.

Homebrewing,3dn313,NDAugustine,7,Fri Jul 17 16:42:08 2015 UTC,I personally would double the dry hop amount. It won't bother the ibu and give you a more aromatic final product.
Homebrewing,3dn313,soeasy11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:40 2015 UTC,Excellent. I may try that. I am never opposed to hops.
Homebrewing,3dn313,bgrueyw,3,Fri Jul 17 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason for the 45 minute addition? It won't have any really flavor impact.  Also 53 IBUs is a lot for a 1.038 OG, in general I would try for a max of 1 IBU per .001 in OG, unless you are going for a session IPA.  Also what is your target mash temp?"
Homebrewing,3dn313,bgrueyw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"That's great advice. If I take out the 45 min addition, that gets me right at 38 IBUs.   Mash temp at 154."
Homebrewing,3dn313,turduckenpillow,2,Fri Jul 17 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"154 is perfect IMO. There seem to be two general theories on low gravity brews. One is low mash temp for a lighter more drinkable beer, and the other is higher for a mouth feel that is closer to a standard 1.050 OG brew."
Homebrewing,3dn313,TheReverend5,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"Brewed the same one a few months ago that turned out really well.  Don't know gravities but it turned out to 6% abv.

Shot for 1.5 gallons, got 2.15 gallons. My batch of centennial has 8.9% AA. Hop schedule was:  • 0.3 oz Centennial FWH - 60 min  • 0.3 oz Centennial - 10 min  • 0.3 oz Centennial - 5 min  • 0.3 oz Centennial - 0 min, 20 min hop stand  • 0.8 oz Centennial - dry hop 4 days"

You can, as you say, start with 5 gallons and top up.  You could also add water to the pot as you boil  (at like 30 and 45 minutes, for instance) which would have the benefit of sterilizing it."

Homebrewing,3dnvs7,DeadNerd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Wait. If you're making a 5 gallon batch, you should boil with 5 gallons of water? I just bottled my first batch, so I'm really new to this. But the instructions in the kit I used said to boil with 2 gallons and top off up to 5 gallons of nearly ice cold water in the fermenter."
Homebrewing,3dnvs7,brock_lee,2,Fri Jul 17 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"Kits will use a lower volume because people usually don't have a pot large enough; and you add fresh water to the fermenter at the end.  OP wanted to use enough water to not have to top up at the end, which is totally doable if your pot is large enough.  His pot is still a little too small."
Homebrewing,3dnvs7,DeadNerd,2,Fri Jul 17 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"Ah. So, I know I'm not OP, but I'm getting ready to brew a 5 gallon batch of pumpkin ale with 10 pounds of fermentables. Is topping off ok, since I only have a 5 gallon pot? How much water do I need for that much?"
Homebrewing,3dnvs7,therealmrfish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"Try to use as much water in the pot as you can while still avoiding boil overs. Then use the remainder to top off. Assuming you're using extract, all your sugars are already there, regardless. It's the hop utilization or adjunct utilization that changes, but it's not massive."

Homebrewing,3dmhgn,ItsBrewbert,3,Fri Jul 17 13:50:32 2015 UTC,"Check out Brew in a Bag. All-grain without the mash tun, saves space!  Basically, you can use any recipe and scale it down. Nothing wrong with 1 gallon batches.  You can use a program like BeerSmith to scale the recipe down automatically, or you can do the math yourself. A solid ""inbetween"" option would be to use something like BrewToad, put the recipe in, and change the batch size."
Homebrewing,3dmhgn,UnsungSavior16,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, this sounds like what OP wants. As a side note, I found my efficiency with BIAB was a little lower then predicted for most 5 gallon recipes.  If I were OP I'd scale and follow the recipe word for word the 1st time but make sure to get a good hydrometer reading and calculate efficiency. If it's low, you may want to start adding 10% extra grains (depending on the calculated value)"
Homebrewing,3dmhgn,CrossCheckPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:30:19 2015 UTC,I think that even with brew in a bag I'd be limited. I guess I should have clarified that I'm still on the stove top since propane tanks are prohibited at my apartment. I don't think I could do a 5 gallon BIAB all grain since my brew pot isn't big enough to hold all that grain and I don't know if I would be able to get a  bigger pot to come to a rolling boil. Sort of a weird predicament that I've been trying to find a solution for.
Homebrewing,3dmhgn,UnsungSavior16,2,Fri Jul 17 14:32:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, no worries! I'm an apartment brewer as well.   I use my stove top, and I can do six gallon batches no problem. Typically though, I do 3 gallons and it is a fast brew day. One gallon batch you'll have no problem at all.   If you do have a problem, you can buy/make a heat stick. Very cheap, and helps bring water to temperature. You can also look into induction, but the heat stick is cheaper.  You could get a larger pot to get to a rolling boil, and no reason to do a 5 gallon BIAB. You can do a one or two gallon BIAB, and it'll be fine! You can even calculate to use top off water after the boil is finished, the only thing that would change in those recipes would be hop utilization.   You have plenty of options!"
Homebrewing,3dmhgn,Oginme,2,Fri Jul 17 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"I make 10 liter (about 2.8 gallons) on my stove top (propane) very easily.  No problem getting a good rolling boil and my boil off rate is about 14.7%, which is on the higher side of normal from what I have heard.  Any recipes can be scaled down to 1 gallon or 2 gallon sized batches pretty readily.  If you have your grains crushed at a local shop, ask them if they would double crush and you should have no problems with efficiency."
Homebrewing,3dmhgn,NDAugustine,3,Fri Jul 17 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"At these volumes, the recipes scale linearly. That is, you can take a 5 gallon all-grain recipe and simply divide everything by 5. I use 1 gallons batches all the time to experiment with a new yeast or something. Better to have 12 bottles of something that didn't work out than 60."

Homebrewing,3dmhgn,Rad10Ka0s,0,Fri Jul 17 22:36:51 2015 UTC,"I did this 1 gallon recipe recently to get my all grain mojo flowing again.  24 oz. Maris Otter (73%) 4  oz.  Pale Malt   (12%) 4   oz. Crystal 60 (12%) 1   oz. Chocolate (3%) .4 oz Cascade at Boil for 60 min.  The 4 oz pale malt was just because I had it left over.  Yeast is half a packet of Muntons Premium Gold.  English hops would be better, but again I had the Cascade on hand.  Estimated OG 1.055, Estimated final 1.016.    Final volume was a little low so OG was closer 1.065, final came about 1.08, so pretty good.    Recipe was self-developed with Beersmith style guidelines for an ESB, hit pretty much right on, color is a tad dark.  All done with standard kitchen tools and a hydrometer.  Mash out on the stove top, batch sparge, strain through a colander."
Homebrewing,3dmg25,rockacessor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"From the picture it looks similar to what starters of mine that are that size look like, that kind of lighter color. I definitely think it wasn't the best idea to leave it next to a flame where it's hot to the touch, not something you would want to do with the yeast. If anything I think you're fine because more often then not yeast persists through. Just continue to shake it and maybe leave it for an extra 12 hours to build up some new healthy yeast."
Homebrewing,3dmg25,zsmith87,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:11 2015 UTC,"I guess that I'm worried that regardless if the yeast are OK, I've already damaged or at least stressed them.

Homebrewing,3dmg25,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"The only thing that would be iffy is the second bullet.  Other than that, your starter looks okay.  The color of the liquid seems correct for a propogating starter.    It wouldn't hurt to buy back-up yeast, but if you're not pitching till tomorrow, I think you're fine.  Just keep swirling it vigorously for the rest of today and then cold crash it in the fridge tonight.  I bet tomorrow morning you'll have a layer of yeast at the bottom, ready to party.    That's how my last starter looked.  I bought a pack of wyeast 1010 and it had a date of 01/27/2015.  0% viability.  I pitched it anyways and it still propogated.  I had a thick layer of yeast covering the bottom of my 2L.  Pitched it a week ago and as of today, it seems liek they're still doing the dance."
Homebrewing,3dmg25,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:53:11 2015 UTC,"I've already seen the yeast cake settled on the bottom multiple times.  What worries me is that they haven't been active, as far as I've seen.  I'm sure there will be a cake to pitch, but I'd like to prevent the realization that the cake is just a collection of yeast corpses, ruining the batch."
Homebrewing,3dmg25,CentralCalBrewer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"As long as you keep stirring it to keep the yeast in suspension and in action, they should be alive and well.  If they haven't been shaken in a long period, then they'll settle to the bottom, but they should be dormant, not dead.  I saw your updated picture and I'd say keep stirring.  You've got the signs of fermentation there with the dark wort changing to a creamy, milky color.    If you're worried, just prepare another starter wort and thrown it in.  This might overbuild your starter, but at least you'll know they're alive.   I saw your comment about not bubbling and some starters will be like that.  Some will completely foam over and out of the flask and some will just do their thing quietly.  My starter that i was talking about had no bubbling activity at all and that scared me because my starter prior to that was super active and spilled over.  I ended up making another starter wort, threw it in, and shortly realized I didn't need to do that at all."
Homebrewing,3dmg25,CentralCalBrewer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:11:12 2015 UTC,"Looks fine. If it wasn't nice and milky I'd be worried, but looks like you've got a good starter there."

The air is pulled from the fermentation compartment over the ice jugs by the fan and blown back into the fermentation compartment.  With something like this you can make it any size you want. It could even be disassembled when you're not using it."

Homebrewing,3dm8pc,Ainjyll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"Years ago I saw a guy create a ferm chamber out of rigid foam insulation with two compartments. One contained the fermenter, one contained ice packs. There was a temperature controlled fan which came on as needed to move air between the two compartments and kept the temperature steady in the fermenter. Daily tasks were simply to rotate out the ice packs.  You could build something similar into your closet. The ice compartment could be next to, above, or even below the ferm compartment. I'd imagine the fermenter(s) would be heavier by far so should be on the ground.  Some people would consider that over-engineering. Some people (like me) would never create a system that required any higher level of responsibility and remembering to do something on the operator's part. If you build it please photograph it and share!"
Homebrewing,3dm8pc,btone911,2,Fri Jul 17 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"If I were to do this (and I've been thinking about it for a bit, actually) I'd start by building a custom plywood box with some good insulation attached to the inside with whatever adhesive you like (LiquidNails or the like). Make sure it opens on either the front or the top and has a relatively decent seal (don't want any leaks). Carefully remove the door on the ""mini-fridge"" and attach a thermostat controller and computer fan. Place the fridge in the box and plug it in. Let it run for a day or two and monitor the temps, how much your fridge is running and check for any leaks. If it's holding its temp well, the fridge isn't getting over-worked and you don't have any leaks then you should be ready to rock and roll.

Homebrewing,3dm848,NoPlayTime,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:14:25 2015 UTC,"A couple of the newer how-to homebrew books have graphics that go through the brewing process. I've just browsed them in the store, and don't have them, so I don't have the names off the top of my hand, unfortunately.  Princeton Homebrew aka Solar Homebrew has a 2-page guide to the extract brewing process that I really like named ""How to Brew 5 Gallons of Beer"".  I think there are guides to your bullet points, but they are justifiably book-length guides, including How to Brew. Some of the new books I referenced basically do what you suggest, but then they often lack the detail you might find in How to Brew. After all, homebrewing is very much a process- and science-oriented hobby.  I'm not in a position to write all or part of this for you (if I were, I'd make myself the author).

Homebrewing,3dlvxy,TTUDude,5,Fri Jul 17 19:02:51 2015 UTC,Yep.  It's fermenting.  Anything with sugar that you set out is going to ferment to some extent.  I wouldn't worry about the livestock.  I used to drive through Lynchburg Tennessee several times a year early in the morning (late 1980s early 1990s).  They used to slop the hogs all over the county with leftover grain from fermentation.  The whole county would smell like Jack Daniels and the pigs loved it.  Not sure why they stopped doing this.  Probably some over-reaching government regulation.

Homebrewing,3dioub,alster86,4,Thu Jul 16 16:15:21 2015 UTC,What lacto / yeast is in there? It seems with that much Krausen it's likely got some sac too.
Homebrewing,3dioub,thebottlefarm,5,Thu Jul 16 17:03:06 2015 UTC,I started the lacto from a cup of grain sitting in a liter of water @ 100f for 5 days. It smelled like sour lemons so I figured it should be good.
Homebrewing,3dioub,thebottlefarm,4,Thu Jul 16 17:14:42 2015 UTC,"You likely know this, but generally speaking pure lacto doesn't usually produce much much in the way of krausen. Since it was harvested from grain, then it's likely lacto, plus some sac. Which is fine, as long as it produces enough acidity for you. Looks good to me, how does it taste / what's the ph?"
Homebrewing,3dioub,trimalchio-worktime,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:28 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'm not sure of taste and ph. My thief isn't long enough to get through the krausen. I will keep you posted once things die down a bit.

Homebrewing,3dioub,Leftblackedout,4,Thu Jul 16 17:42:13 2015 UTC,It also has Safale us-05 that I pitched as a 2 liter starter. Since I did my own lacto I'm not really sure what else may be kicking around. I gave the lacto a 2 day head start before pitching the yeast.
Homebrewing,3dioub,trimalchio-worktime,2,Thu Jul 16 17:47:17 2015 UTC,You likely had many saccharomyces and other wild yeasts in the starter.
Homebrewing,3dioub,zsmith87,3,Thu Jul 16 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, probably a cocktail of Sacch, brett, lacto, pedio, and other microorganisms, but unless you have a lab to plate and analyze the culture, there's no way to know for sure whats going on."
Homebrewing,3dioub,Wich3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:11:53 2015 UTC,most likely more enterobacter and acetobacter than brett or pedio. but the sacch from the safale and lacto from the grain are probably over 99% of that culture based on what he said the starter smelled like.

There are videos of Sierra Nevada's open fermentation of bigfoot where you can see exactly how ridiculous the krausen can get, there's no need to keep it closed the foam keeps a perfect seal on it like a constantly renewing skin. This is basically what you're getting with your open fermentation here, huge krausen and eventually it'll start to die down, but you'll want to transfer it somewhere before it's totally down so that it won't get oxygenated; traditionally it'd be bottled with this remaining fermentation time left to make the bottles sparkling."

Homebrewing,3dlzi3,Wich3r,4,Fri Jul 17 10:45:19 2015 UTC,"Table sugar is perfect for bottle carbonating any style.  It ferments away 100%, leaving nothing but alcohol and CO2 behind.  DME will add just a little body, since it doesn't ferment away 100% - since saison is such a dry style, DME is (in my opinion) a worse choice for it than for other styles when it comes to bottle priming.  Never use corn syrup.  It often has impurities that you don't want in the beer.  Use a good priming sugar calculator and call it a day.  :)"

Homebrewing,3dmeh8,bovineblitz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:10:09 2015 UTC,Fermentation going too far wouldn't taste rotten.  Sounds oxidized?
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,CarbonGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:33:29 2015 UTC,In 3 weeks? Airlock was bubbling in secondary so the CO2 was pushing out the O2. And theres no cardboard taste. Maybe I just don't like the stabilizers or sweeten lemonade and prefer it tart with a mild lemon taste.
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,CarbonGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"Is it a suphury taste?  It's a common problem with high citrus and fruit.  Happens to wine often.  Sulphur dioxide I believe it is.   Common methods to get rid of it is to degas the liquid.  It's good to make sure you areate the beginning of the fermentation, and then get the dissolved gasses out later.  I've had the issue with skeeter pee and hard cider MANY times.  I started making sure it's degassed somehow, and it ends up much cleaner taste."
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,CarbonGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe? I don't taste rotten eggs though. And it tasted good before stabilizing. I aerated for the first 3 days, I did not degas though. I have the tool for degassing too. Next batch Ill try that. How long does degassing take? And does too much oxidize the lemonade?  Edit: would residual CO2 really effect the taste that much?"
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,rocky6501,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on this, but timing depends on kind of degassing.  I use vacuum and it takes about 20min.  But that is a guess :) I just know that I've had many batches of lemonade and cider tasting the same funk.  All of which when I looked it up, was sulphur dioxide. I tend to whisk for 5min for at least 4 days after first fermentation, a good areated transfer to secondary.   Which is odd, since in beer, you want to minimize oxidation.   oh, this is why I stick with beer kits, everything is confusing."
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,rocky6501,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:44:16 2015 UTC,Sounds like degassing might be my problem. Best to degas before or after stabilizing?
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,rocky6501,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't stabilized in a few batches.  I let it clear the best I can, degas, let sit for another week and then keg.  I also don't backsweeten :)  I'd do it after, this way all the yeasties will drop out and clear. Or both times.  Never hurts."
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,rocky6501,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:57 2015 UTC,"I bet its the kmeta reacting somehow in the low pH. Like the others say, I'd degass it really well and keep it in secondary for a while to see if it goes away. If you package it, its going to get stuck in the bottle/keg."
Homebrewing,3dmeh8,rocky6501,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"Ya, already packaged. Next hard lemonade Ill degas well and use lactose to sweeten so stabilizing won't be necessary.

I was stirring like mad during this, and even after this and shaking it all in the carboy, some honey still managed to settle. Oh well, wouldn't matter too much, DWHAHB, etc.    Also, the honey itself was in a plastic jug, which I put under a hot tap for 15 minutes so it would pour easier. Then I slowly poured it into the boiling water.   As for the fruit prep, I chopped up the raisins and halved the figs; then kept them rock-hard frozen for a good 24 hours.

Homebrewing,3dl7dd,KCBrewChem,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"This is my first all grain brew, and I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on the situation.  My friend and I attempted to brew a red IPA.  The resulting beer has really good color and carbonation, but the taste is quite bitter.  There isn’t any hop aroma or floral nose to speak of, and no hop flavor on the taste either.  Overall, the beer isn’t bad (no off flavors) just bland, with bitter really being the only characteristic.   The recipe is listed below.  There were a few issues that came up on the brew day, but nothing crazy.  The mash  may have gotten a little hot (towards 160°) due to a thermometer issue.  We also pitched the yeast a bit on the warm side, towards 80°F.  Finally, the fermentation did end up pushing 80° during the peak of fermentation (this issue was rectified on our second brew by use of a swamp cooler).  Would any of these issues contribute to the lack of hop aroma and flavor?  Any other consideration I may be missing?  4 gal batch  Malt 4.80 lbs  - pale ale malt 3.50 lbs  - munic malt 1.25 lbs  - crystal 40 0.30 lbs  - crystal 70 0.10 lbs   -black malt  Mash temp: 153°F for 60 min Batch sparge with 168°F. Mash and sparge water threated with about ¾ of a campden tablet.  Hops 1 oz Simcoe @ 60 min 1 oz Amarillo @ 30 min 1 oz cascade @ 5 min  Dry hopped with 1 oz of amarillo, and 0.5 oz of both simcoe and cascade for 1 week after F.G. reached. Cold-crashed after dry hopping, brought back to room temp and bottled with sucrose as the priming sugar and conditioning for two and a half weeks.  Yeast Wyeast American Ale smack pack  O.G. 1.066, F.G. 1.018  Edit: missed step."
Homebrewing,3dl7dd,TheReverend5,6,Fri Jul 17 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"So, it looks like you added a pretty minimal amount of hops to this beer. You boiled off pretty much all of the aromatics from Simcoe, a lot of the aromatics from the Amarillo, and really just left the Cascade. Your dry hop is also very small as well, if you were going for an IPA style. Basically what I'm saying is that your hop bill is nowhere near close to what an IPA hop bill should be. Use a bittering hop at 60 mins next time (I would use CTZ/Warrior/Bravo/Chinook), and then add 3-5 oz of your flavor/aroma hops of your choice at 0-5 mins left in the boil. Then dry hop with another minimum 2-3 oz. Make sure to use an IBU calculator available on many recipe builders (like Brewer's Friend) to ensure you're not overbittering your beer. Add just enough bittering hop to get you to like 30 IBUs, and get the rest of your IBUs from your late addition hops.  Furthermore, based on your grain bill as well as your fermentation numbers, it looks like your beer is kind of a sweet, caramelly mess that would likely totally overshadow the hop flavor and honestly be way too much malt flavor and sweetness, even for a red IPA. ~15% crystal malt and ~35% munich is gonna be an extremely apparent malt presence that I personally think is totally inappropriate for any IPA. I'm not trying to shit all over your beer here, I'm trying to tell you reasons why I think you might be dissatisfied with it.    If you wanna try a bombass Red IPA again in the future, try this classic Red IPA recipe from Jamil Zainasheff."

As far as the malt flavor, I am actually pretty ok with that part.  It has a fairly dry finish and not super sweet.  Just really missing that nice hop presence.  The recipe you posted looks fantastic though, would definitely love to try it in the future.  Thanks!"
Homebrewing,3dl7dd,beerglut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"No problem man. And, well, Mosher prolly knows better than I do but dang...that's a radical recipe if I've ever seen one! Seems way more like a hoppy amber than an actual ""India Red Ale,"" but I suppose that's inviting a style debate that could be a thread of it's own."
Homebrewing,3dl7dd,beerglut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:15:06 2015 UTC,"Not an IPA, but I recently brewed a version of this and I am really, really enjoying it.  Plenty of hop flavour in that, although I did modify it somewhat to drop the IBUs down to about 45."
Homebrewing,3dl7dd,NOCIANONSA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:33:19 2015 UTC,"Nice.  We bottled our second batch yesterday (a citra pale ale), and from tasting the hydrometer sample, it seemed much more spot on than this one.  Good balance and hop flavor.  So, I guess I am just chalking this one up to too much during the early additions, and then not enough late and dry hop additions?"
Homebrewing,3dl7dd,NOCIANONSA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah possibly, but the recipe I posted is pretty unusual so don't use it as a gauge for typical hop additions - it is very heavy on the late addition.  I find balancing hop bitterness and flavour, and getting it where you want it to be, is the hardest part of brewing because it is so subjective and a matter of personal preference.  It's all trial and error, but it's fun and that's why we all love it!"

Homebrewing,3djzbm,jpiro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"Certainly can't overdo it, which is easy to do.  But in small amounts it can give a big robust flavor to lighter beers."

Yes, it's gelatin fined, but it really didn't get clear until about a week in the keg.    It's got a great malt character with almost some roasty-porter flavors to it.  But it's also very quaffable.

Homebrewing,3djzbm,holybarfly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:28 2015 UTC,That's good to hear that it still took time to clear. I just used gelatin for the first time and I wasn't impressed. I'll hold judgement for now.

I have been unimpressed with my clear beers after the 3rd clear beer because it it such a simple process that does minimal for the flavor.  I actually rarely use it anymore."
Homebrewing,3djzbm,holybarfly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:38:21 2015 UTC,You mean that youve found it negatively impacts flavor?
Homebrewing,3djzbm,ViktorV,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"No, not at all.  Some people say that it does reduce hop flavor with hoppy beers, but I have not found that.  I find that it causes the beer to taste a bit more crisp some times.  INot sure the exact science to that."

Homebrewing,3djbqu,DangerouslyUnstable,13,Thu Jul 16 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"Have you considered brewing more seasonally? I used to get burned out brewing in the summer in my small DC apartment with no central A/C. It would practically be raining in the kitchen from all the condensation by the end of the day. I found I was much happier taking off June-August.  Brewing seasonally would also mean selecting yeast strains that suited your current ambient temperatures, using saison when it's warm for example.   I'd suggest getting a couple good homebrewing books too. The internet is great, but it can be a big help to have something a bit more reliable like How to Brew, Brewing Better Beers, or Mastering Homebrew."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,oldsock,2,Thu Jul 16 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"I really should. I tend to brew mostly IPAs and Stouts/porters because those are my favorite styles, but I think I would prefer a saison that came out well to an IPA that came out mediocre.   And I do actually have how to brew, although I've mostly skimmed it or spot checked a few things, I haven't sat down and really read through it."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,oldsock,4,Thu Jul 16 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"You can always brew a hoppy or roasty beer with a more heat-tolerant strain. Might not be exactly what your dream beer is, but it'll be better than Cal Ale at 80F!  Take a couple months off, do some reading, and save up some cash! Come back when you get excited to brew again."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,skandalouslsu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:25:14 2015 UTC,Try an IPA with Wyeast 3522. It can do upper 70s no problem.
Homebrewing,3djbqu,Makeroftheshoes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"If you're hanging up the brew gear for a while that doesn't mean you still can't immerse yourself in the hobby and culture. Join a local club or like u/oldsock recommends read a home brewing book. I personally recommend ""Brewing Better Beer"" by Gordon Strong. It's what I'm currently reading and is for the advanced homebrewer like yourself. Hopefully you'll find the passion again."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,everdayisbrewday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:34:49 2015 UTC,I second the brewing seasonally. I've tried many Belgian yeasts and I prefer WL550 (supposedly the same as Wyeast 3522). It gives the Belgian character without being too in your face about it.  You can still do hoppy with Saison yeast...it just comes out as a Belgian IPA. The Belgian yeast strains are very tolerant to temperature. I have a great Belgian IPA recipe I'd be happy to share.
Homebrewing,3djbqu,theduke282,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:18:41 2015 UTC,I wont be brewing in Vegas again until late September probably.  Garage just gets to hot to stand near the boil and deal with all the heat.    Using this time to come up with ideas for new beers and buy some equipment upgrades.

I've dumped 6 of them.   I have decided to embrace where I live and my natural restrictions. Brew things that fit my process, current season and that I'd enjoy drinking 5 gallons of. For me that means saisons in the summer. Hoppy saisons when I harvest my hops (so I don't have to pay for expensive hops) and maybe other beers in the winter when my basement is cooler."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,kingscorner,3,Thu Jul 16 19:46:25 2015 UTC,What area are you in? I'm sure someone on here would be happy to have you over for a brew day or two.

Homebrewing,3djbqu,na_cho_cheez,3,Thu Jul 16 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Man I have sort of been going through this right now in a way. It is fristrating and disappointing.  Specifically when I brew any american hoppy style I have about 4/5 batches pretty bad and one drinkable one. High gravity, low gravity, extract, all grain, fermentation temp control or just leaving it in my house at room temp, kegging or bottling, super late hopping, whirlpools, purged keg dry hopping and then closed transfer to another keg to limit oxygen, etc. I've tried lots of small changes  to improve with really limited success, but frankly I think Im just not brewing often enough to keep working at such incremental little improvements when the results are so blahhh...... I have been having some shitty enough  beers I don't even want to share with people, I drink them until I ""teach myself a lesson"" and dump the rest. And to add to that, everybody says any idiot can brew a good IPA,  I wish I could right now...but I think I've given up on that for a while.  All that said, holy crap, I think finding  the style of beer that I have success with matters a lot. I've recently been having tremendous luck with Saisons and Kolsch yeasts for some reason. I've set up an stc1000 temp control fridge and am trying all kinds of different new and exciting things (to me) with saison and brettanomyces for bottle conditioning. The coolest thing has been finding a style that for whatever reason I really like and can also have pretty good success with on my current system. (Not to mention Brett saison beers ain't cheap at the store! So it pays off big time to brew these at home.)  Anyway, if you aren't already, why not go through a bunch of widely different styles and yeasts more quickly to find something you can hit spot on, build some success on, and stick with it for a while? You might just find your 'house beer' that you can nail every time."

Sounds like you may be having a minor microbe issue. Check your ball valves, run boiling water through anything HDPE, bleach your shit, etc. Might improve your future beers that you were having trouble with. I've started running the wort through my valves while it's still boiling hot and chilling straight in the bucket."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,na_cho_cheez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions, I haven't got the best palate by a long shot but haven't noticed any off flavors that seem like bacteria or wild yeasts. I have had what I think is acetaldehyde issues. Which, when I let it condition for longer to try and fix just turns out oxidized anyway so either way the beer is not that great. Interesting point about chilling straight in the bucket. I do use plastic bucket fermenters, and have been suspecting this is one of my bigger problems for my hoppy beers lately but more for oxidation than from beer spoiling microbes. I just BIAB and have a simple kettle with no ball valve, pour straight from the kettle to the bucket after chilling. I'm going to move to a new PET carboy next time with a proper airlock to see if that can help. But my hoppy beers usually turn out into kind of a grassy oxidized boring mess at best, so lately just gave up on them. I'll try again if I get tired of saisons."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,skunk_funk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"Hoppy saisons are great. If the hops age out, it's still good. I like belle saison for hoppy saisons."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,flexyourhead_,2,Fri Jul 17 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"To add on what /u/kingscorner said, have you considered joining a local home brewing club? It had really helped me stay excited about the hobby. It's the best way to get honest, experienced opinions about your beer. I moved to a small town (by comparison, 20k from 150k) last year and was surprised to find a great club. Having something to bring to the next monthly meeting is half the reason I brew."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,Fenix159,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"Totally understandable reasons to stop brewing for a bit until it can be rectified.  What I would probably do myself is search craigslist until I could find a small mini-fridge (I use a 4.4cu ft for my 5gal batches, so think really small) and then use it to control temps on 1gal batches. Cost will be very minimal, and you can hone your recipes and such while adding the control you want, just at a much smaller scale which will reduce costs across the board.  Honestly, my financial situation isn't awesome. I've spent too much on brewing. But I'm also brewing beer that I (and friends, and strangers that they give it to) consistently enjoy.   My advice is probably not the best or most financially responsible advice as a result of my own situation. But there it is."

Homebrewing,3djbqu,FuzzeWuzze,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah smaller ones tend to be more readily available. Especially if you're anywhere near a college that has dorms, you'll definitely find something if you are."

There should be an exchange in local areas where people are upgrading.  I had a mother of fermentation chamber, i left out on the curb for big trash day.  The poachers didnt even want it, and eventually it just went into the big trash pickup.  I would gladly have given it away to someone who would have used it."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,Efferri,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"Man, have I been there. Temperature control IS a huge deal, but there are work arounds.  Like others said, try Saison strains... Belgian is a great one, but if you want a cleaner Saison, stay away LOL. One thing that helped my end product IMMENSELY was... wait for it... YOUTUBE. Watching others brew and seeing their setups was CRUCIAL. Picking up on their little tricks, or finding methods that betterfit my style/equipment really helped. I live in Phoenix. It's 115 degrees out here in the summer and I'm brewing great beers. I don't have temp control (yet) but with a shirt, a plastic oilpan, and some frozen bottles, you can get nice and cool. What I'm trying to say is this... Don't get discouraged on your past failures. Be persistent. Be resilient. All the greats rose from ashes of their own demons and became legends. You can do it!!!"
Homebrewing,3djbqu,bovineblitz,2,Thu Jul 16 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"Watching youtube videos is probably a great idea. Like I said, I'm afraid that since I'm mostly self taught I am making basic mistakes that would be obvious to someone else.

They also have videos. I've learned soooo much from those guys."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,itsme_timd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"Have you checked craigslist for fridge options?  I've gotten fairly lucky and wound up with 2 large mini fridges for $50 each, you might be able to find something affordable as well.  I know you said space is an issue... I used to use a mini fridge as an end table to save space when I lived in a tiny Boston apartment, and this came about after I tried the swamp cooler method for a while and got frustrated with changing out ice all the time, mold in the water, liquid everywhere, etc.  You could probably figure out space if you have a garage.  I think we all wind up making beers we don't totally love.  For me, I keep known successful recipes in rotation.  I have a zest-heavy summer wheat beer, a super hoppy stout I love, a multi-squash porter that I make every year, and a few IPA-type beers where I play with the hops a lot.  Then, I throw in new ideas, like right now I have a super hoppy chocolate brown porter on tap that was pretty risky, or I've been working in lagers here and there.  If something is a bit meh, I can go right back to something that works.  I always have the urge to try out new stuff but at the same time, I get frustrated if I don't have something around that I really enjoy, it can be tough to keep that balance.  If you're dealing with wild fluctuations in temperature you're unlikely to be able to make things you like consistently, I think that's the key for you to enjoy the hobby.  Maybe you could sell some less-necessary equipment to fund a fridge?"
Homebrewing,3djbqu,Sly13adger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"It can be very frustrating to brew batches that are just OK to plain bad, I've been there many times.  As others have said, seasonal brewing could be great for you and saison is a great beer to brew when you don't have temperature control.  Have you noticed better success with your kit brews than with your recipes?  If so then it may just be that you're recipes need tweaking, that's common, you don't always get things right the first time.  If there's no difference in your kit brews and your recipes then take another look at your process and ingredients.  Have you checked your water profile?  It may taste fine to drink but may not be great for brewing.  Are you using fresh ingredients?  Plenty of yeast?  Do you aerate/oxygenate before pitching?  Look at these things and then pick a simple recipe and try it out.  You can make a nice saison with just pilsner, a bit of noble hops, and a good yeast.  I add a bit of wheat and Belgian candi syrup to mine, it's a simple and repeatable recipe that I've always been happy with.  If you still enjoy brewing then don't give up, I'm sure a few adjustments will take care of your issues."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,skandalouslsu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:27:56 2015 UTC,"My water profile is the one thing I haven't really looked into/adjusted at all so far, and I have gotten some feedback on a small competition entry that my water profile may have partially been to blame for some of the issues my beer had. As for kits, I have gottne about the same mediocre results with kits as my own recipes, and the ones I consider to be ""my own"" are honesly variations on kits that I liked, or I will look at several different kit recipes for a style and make one that is an amalgamation of the common themes I find, so I'm not (yet) going whole hog and creating recipes from nothing.  I guess with the water deal, I've gotten the impression that temp control is so important that to an extent it's silly to waste time with other aspects of the beer since they will get swamped out by the issues of temp control (plus I'll admit to being slightly intimidated by the whole process. Water chemistry seems to be one of the more technical and finicky aspects of brewing). However, it's definitely worth looking into."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,Peanut_Butter_Jelly_,2,Thu Jul 16 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"Temp control is important for many styles, but if you're starting with water that isn't good for brewing no amount of temp control can fix that.  Many water issues can be taken care of with a simple water filter, I use an RV style filter and a drinking water hose (not a regular garden hose) for my brewing water.  If you can get a local water report or even better get a Ward Labs report on your water, then that might help.  You can also brew beers that better fit your water profile without the need for a lot of adjustments.    If you get a report and don't know how to interpret it then I'm sure the /r/homebrewing folks could help with that as well."

I live in the Augusta, Ga, area and I've had to make some home brewers out of my friends. Now I live with one and we can bounce ideas off each others heads.   At the end of the day, it is about your happiness with the product you make. A lot of it can be change with equipment, but do the little things you can. The swamp bucket was what I did for years and I made some alright stuff. I avoided ipas like the plague because I couldn't control water and temperature. I feel like it's a really tough style to do right. The stouts and brown ales were what I clung too until I upgraded. My first beer that got me to really keep at it was an extract caribou slobber kit from Northern brewer sitting in a swamp bucket for three weeks before bottling. I figured at the time if I couldn't keep the fermentation at the right temperature, then maybe letting it mellow in the primary would clean it up. A friend gave it to his step dad and he asked what brewery made it so he could buy a six pack."
Homebrewing,3djbqu,Livingthedream_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"Can you take us through a typical brew from recipe formulation to glass? Maybe there is something in your process we can see from afar without seeing you brew. Is there a consistent off flavor to your beers that you don't like? Or does it vary?  I've known people in the some clubs I've been in find out things about their process that took their beers from disappointing to great. Some examples: not good water, infection on cold side equipment such as tubing/plastic fermenter, going overboard with sanitizers, and off flavor extraction during the sparge.   Fermentation control is important, but you can brew good beers without it. Try a basic saison with a no-fuss yeast like 3711. See if it comes out alright. If it does, then let's troubleshoot your process."

Frozen two liter bottles can help drop your fermentation temps. I also want to say you're doing something else wrong besides the ferm temp. I ferment at ambient temps in my apartment and have had pretty solid feedback on my beers.

Homebrewing,3dduy5,bostonbruins922,8,Thu Jul 16 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"According to a fed in our homebrew group, his advice, use UPS or FedEX.  Their policies don't allow it but it isn't illegal and if you cross state lines it doesn't become a federal offense.  That said he also said chances of getting caught are very low, and they probably would just confiscate the box, but you might get flagged for future shipments.  (I didn't even know they could do that)"
Homebrewing,3dduy5,NotaVirus_Click,3,Wed Jul 15 21:35:29 2015 UTC,"I used to ship 6-packs of local beer from here in Montana to my father-in-law in California from my family's business.  I'd done this probably 10 times or thereabout.  I knew the UPS driver pretty well as he was our regular delivery/pick-up guy.  One winter I boxed up some Moose Drool and asked the driver Dave if he thought it would freeze and burst in a warehouse (I used to freeze deer hides and sent them during winter as well and they'd stay froze all the way to California on 2nd Day Air), and he got nervous and told me not to tell him there's beer inside because it's against the law to ship it over state lines.  He didn't say anything about UPS policy; he just said he doesn't want to know what's inside of its gonna be beer because it's against the law.  Personally, I thought it was weird that it's perfectly acceptable to ship bloody animal carcasses and pelts in a garbage bag in a box, but sealed beer bottles are off limits.  But I don't really know how laws work, I guess."
Homebrewing,3dduy5,funfungiguy,8,Thu Jul 16 01:27:06 2015 UTC,You're allowed to ship firearms to yourself without having to go through an FFL transfer.   You can stick a stamp directly on various fruits and plants and send them.   You can ship gunpowder and ammo as long as its ground.

She also just threw it in a box with little packing and no refrigeration so that som bitch was going to be rotting well before some poor bastard got to open it. She was arrested iirc.
Homebrewing,3dduy5,firemogle,2,Thu Jul 16 14:05:40 2015 UTC,I think with alcohol it has partially to do with taxes. Every state has different taxes so they want to avoid people buying all their booze in a state with low alcohol tax like Wisconsin.

While it's nice that she's addressing such things, if this is one of the last traces of Prohibition, we'd be in good shape.

Homebrewing,3dduy5,TheMacMan,20,Wed Jul 15 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, this has absolutely nothing to do with Prohibition, though it eventually transformed into that. Alcohol is illegal to ship due to tax revenue that's lost, if i recall. The law was passed in 1909, Prohibition didn't start until 11 years later in 1920. Eventually the law was used as a ""booster"" for the temperance/Prohibition movement.  I ship something from one state to another, that receiving state wants tax revenue as I've now brought/sent alcohol into their state without paying them any fees at all. Kinda like how several states still prohibit bringing in over a certain amount of booze. When I was in MS in college, we would go over to Tuscaloosa AL to get booze since they had raised their cap. As I understand it, we were technically breaking the law by bringing it back to MS.  Money is everything, and you'll likely find that quite a lot of anti-alcohol laws still in place todayare actually based on arguments of tax and revenue, not religious beliefs."
Homebrewing,3dduy5,msudawgs55,3,Wed Jul 15 17:06:44 2015 UTC,You're right on shipping alcohol. One of the things you sign when shipping it with UPS says that you agree that you'll pay the proper taxes to the state you're shipping it to (for those liquor stores that ship across state lines).

The list goes on and on really. Many are state laws but there are many changes that could be addressed at the federal level to help.

If you travel to Hudson, WI on a Sunday, you won't find much in the way of Wisconsin cars in the liquor store parking lots. Generally 9 out of 10 are Minnesota plates from those coming over to get alcohol.  More importantly, it's about giving consumers the choice of when they should be allowed to purchase and allowing business owners to operate their business when they choose, rather than having the government tell us.  Look at Colorado. They legalized Sunday says a couple years ago. They saw a $10 million increase in liquor tax revenue directly attributed to Sunday sales. If people can simply plan ahead then we wouldn't see such a huge spike in revenue as they would have simply bought it on Saturday and been fine."
Homebrewing,3dduy5,TheMacMan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"There was an increase of $2 Million in tax from Alcohol sales during the first 12 months of Sunday sales in Colorado, not $10 Million. A 6% increase. The rest of the country also saw a 2% increase with no adjustments to their laws. So 4% of the 6% could possibly have a causation relationship with the law change, or roughly $1.3 Million.   Also, Colorado saw an even bigger spike in sales and tax revenues from 05-06 when there were no changes in the laws, than after the 2008 law change, leading to the belief that the causality of the increase in tax revenue cannot be solely attributed to the Sunday sales law change.   Furthermore, they only saw a 3% increase in beer purchases, while wine and liquor both experienced a 7% growth, which would account for much of that extra revenue. Not that it really changes anyone's view on the subject, but my main concern here is beer.

Homebrewing,3dduy5,picard001,3,Wed Jul 15 18:00:39 2015 UTC,With FedEx you need an established account that is approved to ship alcohol.  There is a process the shipper must go through to be enabled to do so.  All alcohol shipments are forced to use the adult signature service (21+ validation by the driver).  And of course you're still bound by state and federal laws.  Alcohol shipping (properly) isn't really viable an option unless you're an established business.  I'm sure the same will go for USPS.

If they told the truth - it would not ship but if they lied and had it packaged up saying it was shampoo or something - I would ship it.  If the customer asked why we could not send it, I told them that is was against the law.  The risk people took was if the bottle broke and damaged other packages.  We told them that the ATF would be called and they would be responsible for the damaged packages.  That would scare them enough so they would leave the store.  So the moral of the story is when you ship it - it's not booze, use zip lock bags, and make sure your package the box well since the shipping companies throw them boxes all around the place.  (Writing ""FRAGILE"" on the box is more of a challenge then it is a warning.)"

Smalls would fall out of bags and get shredded at the ends. As for the rest, because of the speed of the belts, when loading you are forced to kill packages.  Even though it is policy to not throw, the supes demand it on a regular basis, screaming at you and calling you names. You either throw or you fail. I have thrown bags of iphones into the ceiling before. No big deal. If a package won't wedge into the wall, I'll smash it with my boot until it fits. I constantly throw bags and boxes to the top of walls and watch as they fall, sometimes  several times. I have on multiple occasions seen coworkers beat the shit out of boxes out of anger.

Homebrewing,3dkr6h,SeventhMagus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:49:28 2015 UTC,"Blow on the top as it boils, helps keep the top cool enough to condense the foam back down. Works well enough for my pot, you might need a small fan for a flask."
Homebrewing,3dkr6h,fenra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:34:54 2015 UTC,"My last starter I didn't even boil, due to the boil over issues.  I have a waterproof probe thermometer, so I just set the flask on the stove and brought it to around 170-180 and let it sit at that for around 15 minutes.  From what I've read, that's more than enough to pasteurize the starter."
Homebrewing,3dkr6h,McWatt,3,Fri Jul 17 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"Well they aren't designed for boiling from a geometric standpoint, the shape makes them prone to explosive boil overs. That said, I boil starters in mine all the time. Here is what I do: Measure out the water and bring to near boiling in a pot. Put the DME into the flask (off the heat) and add the water, swirling to dissolve. Then put the flask on LOW heat. Slowly heat until boiling. If it starts to boil up, blow over the top of the flask, the lower air pressure should dissipate the foam. Also, I have done 1L starters in a 1000ml flask but it sucks. Don't do that. Only boil in the flask if you have plenty of headspace. A 2000ml flask is what I use but a 5000ml flask is best."

Homebrewing,3dkr6h,MrKrinkle151,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:29:16 2015 UTC,I have no doubt that it is. And at 170F+ it's pasteurized so that's all that matters really.  I just wanted to chip in my 2c on that you might not actually see boiling. :)
Homebrewing,3dkr6h,AN71V1RU5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"Because of the solute concentration of the wort, the boiling temp is raised above that of the surrounding water, so you won't reach a full boil (like how salt raises the melting point of ice). But like you said, this isn't crucial at all."
Homebrewing,3dkr6h,thebottlefarm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:11:04 2015 UTC,"If you are really worried about it you can always add a healthy portion of salt to the pot water so it boils at a higher temp, thereby allowing the wort to also reach its boiling point."

Homebrewing,3dldvz,LooseSeal-,6,Fri Jul 17 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"Not an issue, assuming you made an extract beer. If you did, you're fine, either your sample or your reading was wrong somehow, but the amount of sugar in extract is well understood. If you diluted with the right amount of water, it will be fine. No, you're fine. Some pseudo-scientific tests have actually shown that material helps the fermenting beer. When you take gravity readings over the course of a couple days, and the readings don't change. That's when you know the yeast are done eating all the sugars they can, and it's time to bottle. You can use a secondary, but by no means is it necessary. Leaving a beer in primary for 3 weeks isn't going to hurt anything. As for doing something with an airlock, I would hope, ya know, you use one. :P   RDWHAHB, sounds like you did just fine for your first batch."
Homebrewing,3dldvz,juanbobo808,2,Fri Jul 17 05:32:38 2015 UTC,Thank you! Makes me a feel a little better. Yes it was a extract beer. What is the best method to periodically checking the gravity to see if it stabilized? The whole sanitation thing has me nervous. Do I just pop the lid on my primary and siphon some out and then reseal it? How many days without movement is good? If I do not use a secondary fermenter do I just need to wait for the beer to stop fermenting to bottle?
Homebrewing,3dldvz,juanbobo808,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:42:29 2015 UTC,"Give it at least 10 days before you start checking gravity, and then if for 1-2 days the gravity doesn't change then you're good to go.   Essentially, yes just siphon it out. You will want to be careful to be sanitary at this step, because it's probably the point in the brewing process with the highest chance of infection. Keep everything clean, and then sterilize before use. I use a spray bottle with star san to sanitize, personally."

That's when you know the yeast are done eating all the sugars they can, and it's time to bottle.   Since this is OP's first batch, I'd just like to clarify that the readings should be in the 1.010-1.015 range when it's done. If you're sitting at 1.020 for 2 days without much change, you may have a slightly stuck fermentation."
Homebrewing,3dldvz,justtappingit,2,Fri Jul 17 12:37:14 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the gravity, everyone misses their OG by a couple points here and there.  The sediment in the fermentor is not a problem.  You will notice even more as the yeast goes ham on those sugars.  I would wait the full 3 weeks plus a few days to be sure.  The other comments are spot on that a stable gravity means the beer is done, not when the airlock stops bubbling.  Just a word of caution, sampling to frequently may introduce infection or oxidation.  Similarly,  transferring to secondary is another chance for infection or oxidation.  With this recipe and setup, I would expect little to no flavor/clarity benefits of using a secondary.  If you don't have one already, I would recommend getting a bottle filler.  TLDR:  You didn't mess anything up, any variation from the recipe makes the beer your unique creation."
Homebrewing,3dldvz,justtappingit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:00:19 2015 UTC,Thank you. I did get the bottle filler attachment with the set I bought. Seems like a must have. I think ill play it safe and leave it in the primary for a while like you said and bottle without the secondary.
Homebrewing,3dldvz,BraveryDave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:17:49 2015 UTC,"Also, can you give any advice on bottling? Ive read so many mixed things. Some say 1 week at room temp before its drinkable. Others say 2 and even more weeks. Does the type of beer matter here assuming its all ales?"
Homebrewing,3dldvz,BraveryDave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:28:52 2015 UTC,"Like everything else in homebrewing there is no exact answer.  I am very impatient and always open a bottle after one week which is often to early.  However, I do like tasting how the beer develops so I say why the hell not try it.  2 weeks is usually the sweet spot.  The ABV and the temperature that it is stored at are the biggest influences,  not really type.  Let the bottles sit at room temperature to carb up, once in the fridge the yeast will go dormant.  I super high abv beer will take much longer to carbonate than a 5% beer.  Looks like you will have something around 6% and I would think after two weeks you will be good.  The flavors will continue to develop and meld together after that so be sure to taste test and a regular schedule.  :)  Below is something I typed up for a buddy, everyone has their own way of doing things, here is mine:  My bottling day. 1.)  Run the bottles through the dishwater high heat and no soap.   2.)  Use this bottle washer to spray star san into the bottles.    3.)  Use a normal home depot spray bottle to sanitize the dish water rack, return the bottles to the dish washer to drip dry a bit.    4.)  Clean and rinse out the spigot of the bottling buck, assemble it, fill it with star san and check for leaks.  Throw the bottle caps in to get sanitized.  5.) Weight the fermentor with the beer in it.  That weight minus the weight of the fermentor (after your siphon to bottling bucket) plus the gravity/abv of the beer can give you your volume.  I use beer smith for this, or just eye ball the volume in your bucket.    7.) Empty the bottling bucket, running some of the star san through the spigot.  Move the bottle caps to a paper towel.  8.)  Siphon the beer into the bucket.  Weigh the empty fermentor including the leftover trub to get the final volume in the bottling bucket.     9.) My preference is to use two priming sugar calculators to double check that I weigh out the correct amount of sugar.  10.)  Boil a couple cups of water, add the priming sugar, throw it in the freezer to cool down a bit, and gently stir it in.    11.) Fill bottles and cap.  Gently stir now and then to make sure the priming sugar stays in even suspension."
Homebrewing,3dldvz,justtappingit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:10:34 2015 UTC,Thank you much for writing that up. Im already getting impatient and I just started last night. I suppose im looking at around 5 weeks for the fermenting and the bottle priming so ill have to put it out of mind for a while and just check on my airlock. Would you recommend leaving the beer in the fermenter for a solid 3 weeks so you know for sure its ready to bottle or check the gravity periodically after the 2 weeks mark. I know checking too much gives nore chance for bacteria but I want to taste this stuff asap. Thanks again.
Homebrewing,3dldvz,chino_brews,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"On all normal-strength beers I just leave it for 2.5-3 weeks and call it good.

Two days ago, it was 1.014. Tonight, it was 1.016.   Is it possible for the gravity to increase during fermentation? If so, what causes that? Or did I just read it wrong (either during the last two readings or tonight)?"
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,bambam944,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:18 2015 UTC,"It can't increase in gravity. An increase would mean your sugar content increased which can't happen without you adding it in one form or another.  Assuming you measured it at the same temperature each time, one of the readings was likely mis-read.  Each time you take a reading, check the temperature as well, then use a hydrometer adjustment calculator like this one to calculate your actual gravity.  You'll need to check your hydrometer's instructions to see what the calibration temperature is, but I believe most of them are calibrated at 60F.  All that said, after 16 days, your beer is probably done fermenting unless you're brewing a lager.  [Edit - term correction]"

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,Snoballz,2,Fri Jul 17 01:46:13 2015 UTC,You should be fine. Yeast calculators say that 3 week old yeast is still 80% viable. You could make a vitality starter and be sure the yeast is ready to pitch.

Wild microbes, especially Brettanomyces yeast, are pretty adept at digging into wood where it is hard to root them out. If you are lookiing for vanilla, but not alcohol flavor, I'd probably boil the cubes for around 5-10 minutes. You'll lose some oak flavor, but there will be enough left on first use to get you the vanilla. You are looking for medium toast or medium-plus toast."

I cracked open the lid and it looks great and no overwhelming smell from the fermentor but the sample in the glass smells worse than gross.

My question is: If I buy the cooker, can i put in my lauter device, then heat up the water, do the mash and lauter it all in one go? Or is it safer to stick with a conventional MLT and add the heated water from my pot and gas stove (which i already own)  Thanks in advance"
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,oldsock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:30:21 2015 UTC,There is no reason you have to heat water separately to mix with the grain (although by adding the water slowly you can have a bit more control over the temperature).

That video you linked has some other setups, and I am sure you can find one of the many videos that explain how to DIY.  Basically, the pond pump sits in the bucket filled with solution or water. A vertical PVC pipe runs from the pump and does the cleaning. There are PVC pipe ""arms"" on the vertical PVC pipe that both help hold the keg/carboy and also act as a place you can connect your keg fittings with QDs. The lid has a hole in it sized to allow the vertical pipe to come up, and the keg/carboy to rest inside enough so the splashed solution drips back into the bucket."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"It depends.  Per the 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines, the OG range for an American Wheat Ale is 1.040–1.055, and for a German Weissbier the range is 1.044–1.052. But a wheat beer recipe does not have to be designed to fit in those ranges.  If yours is an extract beer, then OG is a matter of formula -- amount of sugar (dry or liquid extract and some extract from specialty grains) dissolved into the batch volume. So if you add all the sugar, don't spill anything and get it all into the fermentor, and top off to the proper batch size, then you will hit the recipe OG. Any discrepancy is due to the well-known difficulty of properly mixing wort and water when topping off.  If it's an all-grain or partial mash beer, then ""normal"" depends on the bill of fermentables, and you'd need to post the recipe."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,bluelinebrewing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"The Brooklyn kits don't give you a hydrometer or anything else to test gravity with, so it makes some sense.  No reason to tell you where you should be if you can't tell where you are."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,arseniq33,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:12 2015 UTC,Absolutely. It's just rather disappointing when you do acquire an hydrometer.
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,2,Thu Jul 16 20:01:26 2015 UTC,"To get a rough estimate of OG, multiply the pounds of grain by 24, divide that number by 1000, divide by # of gallons, and add 1.0. (E.g., a 1 gallon batch with 2 lbs. 4 oz. of grain * 24 = 54. 54 / 1000 = 0.054. 0.054 / 1 gallon = 0.054. 0.054 + 1 = 1.054 OG, estimated).  Why 24? This works because most grain yields on average 36 points of gravity per pound when dissolved in one gallon of wort at 100% brewhouse efficiency, and 67% is a reasonable estimate of the average efficiency you would get using the BBS process as shown in their video. 36 * 67% = 24.  I have the BBS book and brewed one of their kits. Some of their recipes are really good (many of the others are a mess). One of the things I hate about them is how they treat their recipes like some sort of state secret (they are not the only one who does this). My other beef is how they use unusual and inconsistent brewing sugars for priming more to fit their Park Slope hipster ethos than for any brewing reason.

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"NP. FYI, that 36 GGP, or gravity points per pound -- and there are metric figures for all of this I am sure -- is for most base malts, although some yield up to 38 GGP and as low as 34 GGP. Crystal and specialty malts/grains yield between something like 20 to 34 GGP mashed, and as low as 0-8 GGP or higher when steeped. I just picked 24 (as 67% of 36 GGP) to be easy, knowing that those lower-yielding grains are used in small quantities generally."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,suvanna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"sounds about right for a low abv, but your recipe should state a target OG. if not you can use a software like brewtoad or calculate by hand (edit) taking into account the efficiency of your setup"

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,BookOfThel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"For sour beers that are aging for awhile, how much does temperature control matter after the primary fermentation has completed? I don't want to tie up space in my fermentation chamber for a year to do a sour so I was hoping I could move it to a place in my apartment (ambient between 70-80). Are certain strains of Brett, Lacto and Pedio more tolerant of heat? I'm concerned if it gets too warm that they will produce off flavors."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,Jeickhof,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"Just some anecdotal evidence, but I have about 8 sour beers in carboys just sitting in our cellar at ambient temp for the summer at 68-72 and I have found them to be bulk aging just fine. Not sure if certain strains are more heat tolerant though. I think higher temps encourage a more vigorous aging from bacteria and brett If i remember."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,DeadNerd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:10:35 2015 UTC,"Can someone please review this recipe? I modified it some from another recipe I found.   The things I changed are:   Increased the LME from 6lb to 6.6lb, since each can is 3.3lb.  Increased the pumpkin from 30oz to 45oz for a more pronounced pumpkin flavor.   Do you see any issues with the changes I made?   Also, the original recipe only called for 8oz of brown sugar. That seems low, considering the last 3.3lb LME brew I did called for 2.2 pounds of sugar. Should I increase the amount of sugar?   Thanks."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,suvanna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"the sugar is just going to dry it out, so its up to you. most commercial pumpkin brews are pretty dry in the 8-10% abv range, but I like to enjoy a few without getting completely toasted. I'd also add some biscuit in there, maybe 3-5% of the fermentables to give a warm bready tone."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,DeadNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"More sugar = higher ABV?  Also, when do you add the biscuit to the brew? Just steep it with the carapils and crystal?  Thanks!"
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,suvanna,2,Thu Jul 16 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"correct, correct! you may want to read How To Brew or some other brewing literature, because understanding this relationship is fundamental to brewing and creating your own recipes! the malt extracts you are using are also sugars, however when metabolized by yeast there will be byproducts which give beer complex flavors. simpler sugars such as sucrose will be metabolized more completely with less byproducts, resulting in a more prominent alcohol taste. that's what I mean by dry."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,atwoheadedcat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:05:18 2015 UTC,A little bit confused with this... Can a refractometer be used for an OG and FG reading? I want to pick one up for testing the gravity of my one gallon test batches.
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,2,Thu Jul 16 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. Use the °Brix scale for OG and FG, then plug them into an online refractometer calculator to correct for the presence of alcohol and convert your gravity into the SG scale. You need to do the correction because the refractometers we use are calibrated for the refractive index of an aqueous fructose solution (or sometimes wort) and if any other liquids with different refractive indices are dissolved in the sample (like alcohol), you need to correct for that."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,bambam944,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:28 2015 UTC,"You can do it, but the alcohol will throw the reading.  You need your OG and to do some calculations to use a refractometer for FG.  This calculator should do the job"
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,HotCarls,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:38 2015 UTC,Yes but your reading on the FG is not real and you need to use a calculation including the OG to get the actual number.
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,Driftmaster,2,Thu Jul 16 17:34:58 2015 UTC,Can anyone point me to or give me some information on quick connects?   Can you mount them on anything? Like if I have a kettle with a threaded ball valve do I just screw it in? Are they standard sizes?
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,bluelinebrewing,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're talking about hot-side stainless disconnects, i.e. for a ball valve on a kettle or mash tun.  Typically, one side is the standard 1/2"" NPT or a hose barb, and the other side is a male or female quick disconnect.  So, yes -- you'd thread a male disconnect into the ball valve (probably in place of a hose barb).  You'd then make hoses with female quick disconnects on them, probably with hose barbs. There's basically two options of types of disconnects, the ""garden hose"" or ball lock style: http://www.morebeer.com/category/stainless-steel-quick-disconnects.html and camlocks: https://www.brewhardware.com/category_s/1844.htm  I personally prefer camlocks, the one disadvantage being that they can't be swapped one-handed."

If it looks about done and tastes good, it may be more ready to bottle than you think it is.  But what I would probably do is cold crash both, bottle the one after a couple days of that. Let the temp rise, swirl up the other bucket to get yeast back into suspension. Wait a couple days at ale temps and then check gravity again. Has it moved? If no, it's done and you can just cold crash and prep for bottling again."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,Sly13adger,7,Thu Jul 16 16:51:31 2015 UTC,"Another option or to build on what's said above, you can move the unfinished beer out of the fermentation chamber and let it ride ambient temperature. The fermentation is mostly done which means the added temperature will just help the beer bottom out."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:07 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to still get sediment in the bottles even after cold crash?    I cold crashed my blonde ale for 4 days at 38F.  Racked from the primary to a bottling bucket as usual.  I bottled last Thursday.  Before I left for work today, I noticed sediment at the bottom of the bottles."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,makubex,2,Thu Jul 16 15:39:52 2015 UTC,"Short answer: yes.  Long answer: Assuming you're bottle conditioning, the sediment at the bottom of your bottles is 99% yeast.  This is perfectly normal for bottle conditioned beer.  Even with a cold crash, there is still a significant amount of yeast cells in suspension (otherwise bottle conditioning wouldn't work).  For this reason, it's generally recommended to refrigerate homebrew for 24 hours in an upright position so the majority of the yeast settles out and sticks to the bottom of the bottle when you pour."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,jmwo,2,Thu Jul 16 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"If you primed with sugar so the bottles carbonate, any remaining yeast will reproduce, carbonate the bottles, and eventually drop out."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,obobeyo,0,Thu Jul 16 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"Second question. Brewing with kegs, is it any different than with carboys. Will the beer taste different? I saw there are lots if different types of kegs, is there one better than the other? And is it worth it?"
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,bluelinebrewing,2,Thu Jul 16 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly what you mean.  Mostly, homebrewers use kegs to carbonate and dispense their beer on a draft system.  It is possible, however, to use kegs as fermenters (i.e. in place of a carboy).  In that case, there's not really any difference.  In theory, the geometry of a fermenter affects fermentation to some degree, but it's minimal at best.  Does that answer your question?"
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,obobeyo,0,Thu Jul 16 15:37:31 2015 UTC,Yes I think it does. So kegs are used for carbonizarion in the place of bottles.
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,bluelinebrewing,3,Thu Jul 16 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Generally, if you're kegging, you don't naturally carbonate (i.e. by adding priming sugar and sealing it up, like with bottles).  Instead, you connect CO2 tank and regulator to the keg and force carbonate.  Once the beer is carbonated, the CO2 is used to push the beer out a beverage line and faucet, just like in a bar."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,camkotel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:14:37 2015 UTC,I use them for anything that's going to age at all. I know the bottle conditioning will take up some of the oxygen but anything else the caps help with. I've got some bottles of a quad I bottled in December and they're not showing any signs of oxidation.
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,Sly13adger,2,Thu Jul 16 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"I used them pretty frequently when bottling. I'm not sure how important the really are, but I remember reading an article posted earlier that they are excellent absorbers of hop essential oils leading to reductions in perceived aroma."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"Very odd. I really don't recommend their old stir plates because their design has no way to sink the heat from the dropped voltage,and load fluctuation can potentially cause problems ranging from thrown stir bars to fire. Stirstarters are available in your neck of the woods at RiteBrew, you pay actual shipping cost only, and they run lots of deals. The enclosure is not big like the old Yeastir but you've got a much lower chance of ""letting the smoke out"" of the components and possibly returning after work to the charred embers of your home."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:49:47 2015 UTC,Hrm.  Thats basically what i have as is.

I guess its maybe their way of avoiding liability?
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:33 2015 UTC,"Could be.   I don't quite understand how the Underwriters Laboratory thing works, but there is no way Yeastir or most of the ""simple"" DIY stir plate builds could meet any applicable UL standard(s).  To beat the dead horse yet again, the Stirstarter uses an LM317 voltage regulator and heat sink, as well as a couple capacitors, to build a potentially safer appliance."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"This may be overblown (pardon the pun) in many cases because so many of these builds have a GIANT FAN inside the box, so if there is any air exchange at all it might not be a problem.  But there have also been enough posts on this sub about blown stirplates, and every one of these I examined were the ""simple"" build.  It's probably not a huge fire risk (maybe one in 10 million units), but I don't want to be the guy who DIYs a potential fire hazard. Of course, I also keep a fire extinguisher in the kitchen and by my propane burner on brew day, so maybe I'm just risk-averse when it comes to fire says the guy who lit his desk on fire in his dorm room ."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,dtwhitecp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:33:10 2015 UTC,"I would be very surprised if you can get that down to 1.013, even with that low mash temperature. Belgian beers can get that kind of attenuation due to the voraciousness of Belgian yeast and the addition of simple sugars, and even then you have to keep your eye on it, make sure you give it plenty of oxygen at the start and a healthy starter, etc.  Just saying, it could happen, but don't be surprised if your FG is closer to 1.02, which is still around 11% ABV.

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,redoran,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"I think it gets a little funny when alcohol gets higher, since the booze has a density of 0.789 g/mL.

For comparison:   Belgian strong ale yeast: 74-78% attenuation San Diego super yeast: 76-83% attenuation   I think I have a fighting chance... but I guess we'll see.

Barleywines go up to about 12% at the highest of their style guidelines, so it shouldn't be too bad. Of course, Barleywines tend to have a lot of aging before release.  I think you should try it once it is fermented out, and see what you think; if it needs more aging, think of a different beer you can use as a gift, and give this one as a gift NEXT year. If it is at a level you find to be acceptable or able to be hidden behind dry hops, you can try that as well."

Homebrewing,3dhv5l,CranialFlatulence,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"I need to know what's causing my extremely low efficiency - around 55%. Here's what all went on with my last brew...see if you can help me out:  Bought the grains (10.25 pounds) precrushed on July 7 thinking I would brew on July 11. I stuck the grains in the fridge just to be sure no critters got to them. I took them out on July 10 so they could warm up before mashing.  Turned out I couldn't brew until yesterday (July 15). My target mash temp was 152 F. I started mashing at around 156. By leaving the top to the cooler open and stirring more frequently than normal the temp was down to about 151 when I started batch sparging. Mash time was around 50 minutes. Iodine test indicated mashing was complete.  I batch sparged in three steps with a bit over 2 gallons per step. I left the sparge water in while the next 2 gallons were warming to 168, so each step took about 10 minutes.  My preboil gravity was 1.034 (beersmith anticipated 1.036, so I was happy with this). My OG ended up being a paltry 1.041 where I was hoping for about 1.055...which would have given me 74% efficiency.  The grains were measured for a 6.5 gallon preboil volume, but there are two gallons of space below the drain valve in my keggle, so I increased my sparge volume to start boiling with 8.5 gallons. Would that have been the culprit?   *EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. I figured the problem was the additional 2 gallons of water. I guess I figured since I was adding the water during sparging instead of simply adding water to the boil volume it wouldn't have made that much of a difference. I expected a little hit to OG, just not quite what I was getting.  I've decided to modify my keggle to allow me to get stuff out of the bottom rather than increasing my boil volume. Here's my plan for my keg...this should work. Thanks again."
Homebrewing,3dhv5l,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:30 2015 UTC,"You can customize your equipment profile for your system in Beersmith to account for the 2-gallons of dead space loss in the keggle. Then when you use that equipment profile for a brew, the software will adjust for that dead space, and you'll need to add more grain to hit your desired OG.   That's not going to make your efficiency higher. You would have to reduce the system loss to boost your efficiency."

I use one of those, and I usually throw a large book or something under it (on the opposite end of where the valve is) so it is tilted towards the valve. I do this right before the vourlauf. I've been able to get down to less than 0.25 gal of dead space this way."

My guess is it won't, and that cold crashing right after you add them might aid in killing the yeast. The dry hops should not matter either way.

Mostly with mead, you just throw the fruits in with the mead as it ferments, rack, rerack, etc.. until you get the desired result. But with beer, it's such a bigger pain in the ass. Do you boil? Throw it in during flameout? Will the juice turn acidic and bitter if I cook it? How do you do x or y for z? Mead can (for the most part) worry less about the fruit and more about when to rack. Beer is just a different monster.   That being said, I'm brewing a naval orange IPA currently (5 gallon batch). It's still fermenting, but the sips I've taken from my wine thief are promising. I added 1oz of orange zest and 1oz of bitter orange peel 5 minutes before flameout, and plan on adding another 2oz of zest when I throw in my dry hop additions.

As for peaches, removing the skins and pits helps significantly with the flavor but is very labor intensive!   True dat, but you can go a long way at curbing that by poaching the peaches and then quickly ice bathing them.  The skins almost slough off on their own.  If you squeeze along the seam, you can usually get them to pop in half and pull the pit from there.  Not labor free, but a lot faster than using a knife or potato peeler."

I have a great source for peaches and nectarines so that is what I mainly use.  For my sours/wild ales I add the fruit when i ""expect"" the beer to have about 2 months left.  This comes for continually trying to the beer and knowing when it is ready.  Sometimes, I feel like the beer is ready to be packaged when I add the fruit, but I will still let it sit for about 2 months.  For Berliners (not kettled soured) I usually add the fruit about a month in and let it sit for about 2 weeks.  For fruited clean beers I always add the fruit after fermentation is done (about 1-2 weeks after brew day) and let it sit for about 1 week.  Fruits I have used before are; peaches, nectarines, apricots, guava, mango, passion fruit, pears, prickly pear, strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry.

Homebrewing,3di5tk,bovineblitz,2,Thu Jul 16 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"Most of my beers and meads are fruit based, so here I go.   Have a recipe you'd like to share?   My most popular one is Lovers Lament (named after Sprecher made their Valentines Day raspberry stout that bombed). Generic stout recipe except for the following changes:   no aroma hops, instead use a small tin of powdered baker's cocoa (few oils there) after initial fermentation, add 1lb/gal thawed raspberries marvel at the bright pink head as you pour your chocolate milk like beer    What base styles work best with fruit?   Anything mild. IPA's, Imperials, ambers, and dense brown ales have too many other flavors competing for attention. Saisons, wheats, pils, and mild/dry stouts take the flavors nicely. If you think the flavor will work, take a piece of that fruit and pour a beer over it.   Do you have styles you like to serve with fruit?   The same types I brew fruit with. That's where I get the idea of what fruit I put with that beer.   How does fermentation differ when using fruit rather than grains?   Here is the fun part. Fruit is scary unpredictable because of harvest/grow conditions. The same recipe can have you mopping the ceiling or almost no activity based on how well the fruit fared. But the fermentation you get is huge and fast.   When is the best time in the process to add fruit?   After primary fermentation. You don't have to secondary, but this is the time besides cellaring you might want to. Fruit flavors are delicate (like honey) so you don't want to boil them and you don't want them to be picked apart in the primary when the lazy yeast would hit them first.   When are additional enzymes needed? (Pectin)   Pectin is in the fruit, not what you add. If you want to cancel it out you need to throw in pectic enzyme any time (while brewing, when throwing in the fruit, after all fermentation) and give it at least a week, but I don't bother. The worst that has happened was the beer isn't as clear as intended, and the gelatin trick works just fine. However if you do filter your beers (besides your liver) you will need to invest in this as to not clog the filter.  And a special note: peach and strawberry, just don't. All of their flavors just sort of die away and you need a lot (read 2-3 lbs per gallon) to make it noticeable."
Homebrewing,3di5tk,KEM10,2,Thu Jul 16 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"Peaches are wonderful in sours.  I assume it's due to either the acidity or the ability of brettanomyces to scavenge oxygen really well and prevent breakdown of the flavors.  Strawberries tend to get weird though, but I have seen a couple good examples if served super fresh."
Homebrewing,3di5tk,bovineblitz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"If I ever make a sour I'll separate a gallon for a peach test. But after the three batches gave me nothing (wheat, sweat mead, pumpkin peach ale), I've considered them a lost cause."
Homebrewing,3di5tk,KEM10,2,Thu Jul 16 19:14:42 2015 UTC,Interesting.  How much did you use?  I've heard to use 3-4lbs per gallon with peaches.
Homebrewing,3di5tk,bovineblitz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:36 2015 UTC,"Wheat was my first (1 lb/per), the mead was next (used green tea instead of water and 2lbs/per), last was pumpkin peach with another 2lbs/per.  The mead was the only one you could tell it was there.  And 3lbs/per is a lot of money. I'd rather get a mixed/fancy berry blend from a grocer and just toss that in."

I understand that they're more expensive to use (read: needing more lbs/gallon), but they're such a wonderful flavor in some lighter styles of beer (Belgian and German wheats, for example). I've had lots of success infusing these flavors in my beers before, but I would say they take a little more effort and you have to be more experienced in using fruit in brewing before attempting to use them really effectively."

If all goes well, I'll post the recipe.   What base styles work best with fruit?   If you want to stay in style guidelines, then very little. But since we like to skirt the edges sometimes, I would think that depending on the fruit and how much, you could add a little something to almost any style there is.   What fruits have you had the most success with?   With beer, so far just strawberries.   Do you have styles you like to serve with fruit?   Ooh, good idea. I'll try this later!   When are additional enzymes needed? (Pectin)   If you want a clear beer, then add pectic enzyme to your fruit.   When is the best time in the process to add fruit?   Personally I like to let my beer run through primary fermentation before I either rack it onto fruit or add fruit back into the fermenter. Then I will create a mini-must with the fruit and a little bit of liquid that I syphoned off of the original batch, hit the whole thing with K-meta to kill off wild yeasts, wait 12 hours, add pectic enzyme, wait 12 hours, and then either dump the fruit into the fermenter (preferably in a bag) or rack the rest of the batch onto the fruit. Also, it's always easier (to me) to do fruit in a bucket.  Special Notes: It's a good idea to start your beer with a higher FG since the fruit will bring some highly fermentable sugars, that will dry it out. Most fruit will also bring acids, which can be nicely off-set with additional sugars.  Some fruits have a stronger flavor than others (think blueberries vs peaches) so you're going to need more or less fruit based on type and amount of flavor that you're shooting for."

I use the same basic recipe each time: 5lbs 2-row, 4 lbs Wheat, 1 lb carapils. Use hop of choice for bittering and add later in the boil if you want some flavor as well, but not required. Use a yeast of your choice, I usually just use a neutral, clean yeast like S-05 or Pacman.  For the fruit I use frozen bags from the grocery store, 1 lb per gallon. Heat and mash up the fruit in a pot to 160F and hold for 5 minutes to kill the nasties. Dump into secondary carboy making sure to splatter it all over the kitchen so it looks like a crime scene. Let that ferment for a week and rack to tertiary to clean up the beer. Bottle or keg after another week.  Beware that the fruit bits will clog up your siphon and can be quite a pain but it's worth it. The raspberry is hands-down the crowd favorite. The blueberry wasn't bad and the blackbeery was just ok."
Homebrewing,3di5tk,Mitochondria420,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:22:49 2015 UTC,Did you find the raspberry flavor very strong using 1 lb per gallon?  I just finished bottle conditioning a raspberry blonde where I used 4 lbs of frozen raspberries (I didn't pasteurize) in a 5 gallon batch and the raspberries are all I can taste.  I used 9 lbs of 2 row and 1 lb of caramel malt 10L for my malt profile with some bittering hops at 60 min and US05.  If I were to brew this beer again I think I would use 50% less raspberries so the flavors would be more balanced.  [Edit - added Lovibond to Caramel malt]
Homebrewing,3di5tk,bambam944,2,Thu Jul 16 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was nice and tart with a good raspberry flavor. I wanted something that didn't come out sweet as some of the commercial fruit beers tend to do. All I can taste is the raspberry but that's what I was going for. If you want less fruit to balance it a bit maybe try cutting it in half for sure. Will take some experimenting to get it where you want it."

Homebrewing,3di5tk,bovineblitz,3,Thu Jul 16 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, I want you to close your eyes for a minute.  Imagine a nice, big, juicy ripe peach.  It's yellow-orange with ruby highlights, so you know it's at the peak of flavor.  It smells faintly sweet and floral as you bring it near your face.  You start to take a bite and you feel the fuzz on your tongue along with tannins and a bitter/sharp flavor.  This only lasts an instant as you break through the skin and it gives way to a pulpy deluge of fruit esters, acids, and sweetness.  Tastes good right?  Imagine what it tastes like without the sugar (because it ferments out) and the acid (it gets diluted and buried in the beer).  That's what it tastes like when you leave the skins on."
Homebrewing,3di5tk,sillybear25,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"That was pretty convincing.

What fruit works best for adding in the boil and what fruit works best added to the fermenter?    In my experience I have always added orange to the boil like in a Wit and I've used raspberries and peaches after the main fermentation was over. Would adding peaches to the boil bring out more peach flavor or just kill it altogether?
Homebrewing,3di5tk,laxpulse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:45:33 2015 UTC,I make a Passion Fruit Wheat every summer and it's a big hit.  I attempted to clone 5 Lizard from 5 Rabbit Cerveceria in Chicago.    I get Goya brand frozen passion fruit pulp in the Mexican aisle of a large grocery store and I add 2 lbs to 5 gallons in secondary and haven't had any problems with infections.  I've tried using the frozen Mango from Goya but did get infection with that so I started pasteurizing before adding.  For the Passion Fruit Wheat I often use the Honey Weizen Extract kit from Northern Brewer because I know it works but I usually also make an all-grain wit with coriander and add passionfruit.

Added about 2lbs of frozen raspberries directinly into the fermenter (5 gallon batch) after primary was done. From what I've heard there's no need to sanitize the raspberries as any of the wild yeast/microbials leftover will just contribute to the tart flavor.

I was considering using 1 shot of blueberry vodka when racking to the keg for convenience/time.

If I were to do it again, I would use a neutral grain spirit and add lactose to the boil instead.  As for waiting, I would start with a week and then pull a sample every few days until it's right. What's right is going to be for you to decide. Just remember that since the blueberries will have some sugar in them you'll either need to stop fermentation with sorbate or anticipate a small but renewed fermentation."

That said, it is nowhere nearly as nutty as something like Maris Otter. Think of it more like a malt almost as pale as Pilsner Malt, but with none of the DMS issues.  Generally, Weyermann is very flexible in what barley varieties they use, and AFAIK, they change it every year and use several different ones as once. The only ""single variety"" malt where they explicitly name the variety is the Barke malt. I've never seen it in any homebrewers shop, though."
Homebrewing,3dl7qk,_ak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:58:52 2015 UTC,It's quite good and perhaps the most versatile malt available.  The Weyermann pale is not as richly flavored as the UK pales but still has enough gusto to work well as a base in UK styles.  It's also light enough in color and crisp in flavor to make decent lagers and other styles normally calling for pilsner malt.  Single temp infusions work well so it's also easy to mash. Yes it will also do well as a base in American styles as long as you don't mind a little extra malt flavor.

I use it for 25 liter batches and it heats up wort very quickly. I have seen brewers on this forum with a similar induction cooktop with another name.
Homebrewing,3djnw6,why___,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:55 2015 UTC,There is a similar one in the US. The main issue with induction is that it is not compatible with a PID style system.

Most people in the US who go that route build the system themselves to meet their specific needs and brew space and have an electrician add a 220 outlet or use an existing one installed for something like a clothes dryer. You also need to be sure that your kettle is compatible with induction burners."
Homebrewing,3dl2q6,EpicMangina,3,Fri Jul 17 03:30:04 2015 UTC,"Do a brew without any extra ingredients like honey or fruit - stick with just grains/malt extract, hops, water, and yeast. I know it sounds exciting to do all these crazy flavors, but you'll learn a lot more about how to make good examples of beer styles if you start with a basic pale ale/brown ale/tripel/whatever. So pick a style you like, and just brew a good, simple version of that style first, IMO."

It sounds a lot like you purchased expensive equipment for a hobby with the justification of it being for business purposes. I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just being frank. It sounds more like wishing and less like planning.   If you want to approach this as a business, you should set aggressive goals and timelines and stick to them. Schedule meetings with all your local breweries to talk about mentoring you or giving you advice on opening a brewery - you could make these calls TODAY and have all your meetings scheduled immediately. Buy all the books on opening a brewery - read them all THIS MONTH. Figure out your branding and what your brewery evokes in others (taste doesn't even play into this, everyone expects that already - you need a strong unique selling proposition, you aren't selling beer you are selling a feeling/experience).   Figure out every goal you need to hit and put timelines to them. Figure out where the opening capital is going to come from - find investors if needed. Today, not in 3-5 years. You should have the whole skeleton of the business figured out in very, very short order.   You will never have everything ""figured out"" - business rarely works like that for the pros and NEVER works like that for entrepreneurs. You'll have mistake after mistake and your job as the owner is to problem solve everything that comes up.   When it comes to the actual beer itself - that's honestly just another detail to figure out or problem to solve along with the thousand others you'll be facing. It does not take 5 years to figure out how to brew beer good enough to compete in today's market. Either fast-track your learning by brewing a WHOLE DAMN LOT in a VERY short period of time or consider hiring a head brewer to figure it out for you. It's not super difficult to make a tasty beer and any issues here are trivial to fix.   I'm sorry if all this sounds harsh but either you are starting a business or you have a hobby. Both are perfectly acceptable. But if your plan is to brew 2 batches a month for 5 years while making notes about what you'd love to do when you start up a brewery then that's just a hobby. It's dreaming.   If you want top open a brewery and start a real business - do it. Get on the phone. Meet people. Get investors. Buy real estate. Buy equipment. Set the gears in motion. Find mentors. Set goals. Take action. Today.   I'm rooting for you man - I really, really am. I think we all are - it's an AMAZING goal.

Homebrewing,3dhp0d,beericane,3,Thu Jul 16 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"You make some good points, and a couple points I disagree with:   When it comes to the actual beer itself - that's honestly just another detail    Nope. You can probably count on one hand the number of outstanding breweries where the owners are not beer or wine people. The owners may not brew much anymore, but they're still masters of the craft. The days when you could learn on the job are coming to a close with this saturated beer market. For every success story of homebrewers who started at below the Jamil level and made it (Tony Magee, Sam Calagione, etc.) there are probably 25 breweries that opened and shuttered. Making beer is just a small industrial process in the business, but just as McDonald's can't thrive with terrible burgers (and customer service), a brewery with shitty beer is going to struggle.  You can accelerate this by going to Siebel, UC-Davis, Heriot Watt, etc. and then apprenticing, but that's just not their desire.   Take action. Today. [Etc.]   There's a lot to be said for jumping into your dream. There's also something to be said for making a very long-term plan and executing it. Sure, you don't want to make it an excuse to procrastinate, but we don't have any clue as to the actual milestone in the plan. It sounds like OP is approaching this like a business opportunity, because he's clearly not (yet) a passionate homebrewer. Contrary to what I said above, there are some examples of non-brewer/beverage people who have started breweries because they are entrepreneurs and it seemed like a business opportunity they wanted to pursue.

I think beericane makes a lot of good points in terms of taking action now but what isn't in this post is all the action we are taking...starting a blog to share my ideas and journey is one of those actions.  Will it specifically help the overall business plan or accelerate any decisions?  Probably not but it will keep me engaged during the time we are not physically brewing.  It is also helping get the Half Day Brewing name out there.  Before this post, a handful of friends, family, and partners knew about Half Day.  Today, over 1,500 people know about it...as skeptical as some may be doesn't phase me.  The more I put out there about our plans and what we are doing, the more feedback I will continue to receive.

There is a lot more behind our business plan than what is in this blog post.  I can understand why you think 5 years is way too long and if we want to call the first 3 years hard core hobby brewing, then so be it.  We are “business people” too and have investors identified along with a 3 year proforma that continues to change and evolve.  We meet with local brewers often and jlaw is researching and collecting all license requirements.  This blog post is merely an intro and proclamation if you will.  I am sure some of my future posts will come across as “hobbyish” but you can definitely expect more business plan related posts as well.  Two brews a month is definitely low, I agree but as I mentioned is a minimum.  With that said, you can expect a future post on how we fast track our learning on that limited schedule.

Homebrewing,3dhp0d,FuzzeWuzze,3,Thu Jul 16 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing that most people overlook every time i read these posts is just how difficult it is to actually open a brewery.  You dont just post an ad in the paper or on facebook and create a LLC.  Its many years to find a proper location that is zoned properly with enough space, build it up,  get the giant ass list of government forms filled out, sit around waiting months for inspectors for water/sewer,structural engineers, saftey inspectors, the list goes on and on usually.  For some reason people think that the government moves fast, which is not true obviously, many of those inspectors are a minimum of 30-60 days out, some are upwards of a year in some states ive heard.  Oh and you fucked up your safety inspection?  Fix it and sign back up and ill see you in another 90 days when its your turn.  This entire time your burning a hole in your pocket paying your lease and unable to legally produce or sell anything.  There are brewery that go under before opening or shortly thereafter for this exact reason, not because their beer isn't good but because they dug such a giant hole trying to open they cant pay their bills.  Then you get to the ""fun"" part, where every fraction of an  ounce of alcohol has to be meticulously measured, so that you can report it to the government to be taxed properly.  You half ass it here and the IRS has you shut down in no time."
Homebrewing,3dhp0d,brewpirate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, I have heard and read about a lot of these horror stories.  Once you start actually making the alcohol you sell (as opposed to just opening a bar or distributor) it is a completely different ball game.  There is a beersmith podcast with Michael Mraz from Mraz brewing and he has great things to say around this.  He magically worked a deal with his lease where he got the first 6 months free (it may have been longer than that..I forget the exact length of time he had) so he could go through all of the inspections and even had the option to back out of it."

Everything else is pretty much exactly the same.  Most people just stick to one type so it's less headache, so if you get ball lock, just stay with it.

It's on the side of the compressor, where the wires attach (disconnect the power first). Do a little research and test it with a multimeter to see if its worth replacing. Check your local junkyard or dump before you buy a new one, and the replacement doesn't necessarily have to be an exact match."

Start easy, don't invest too much at first (you may find you don't enjoy the process, I think that's the biggest gripe with most new brewers) and just produce simple, delectable beers with the easiest method possible. Focus on finding a flavor profile that you think will satisfy your drinking urges. You can't go too wrong. I also suggest drinking what you make, even if it doesn't turn out quite right. Unless it's quite moldy (it shouldn't be, if you follow good sanitizing procedure), it may be gross, but everything you make after will be godly compared to any failures."

For this you need a kettle that can hold about 3 gallons of liquid. Then you need a fermenting container. A 5 gallon bucket, with a sealing lid can work if you drill a hole for the airlock. Then you need bottles, caps, capper and someway of getting the beer out of the bucket into bottles. A siphon hose and bottling cane will work. That's the very least.  There are basic brewery kits (http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/beer-equipment-starter-kits/essential-brewing-starter-kit) that come with a bunch of usefull, but not always necessary, equipment for under a hundred dollars.

Homebrewing,3dit30,toomstoned,2,Thu Jul 16 21:00:56 2015 UTC,Should be using the paint strainer bag around the auto siphon to keep hop floaties from ever getting sucked in during transfer.
Homebrewing,3dit30,kingscorner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:16:51 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting.  Maybe I'll stick with them."
Homebrewing,3dit30,rocky6501,3,Thu Jul 16 17:31:50 2015 UTC,I only use them when using more than 2oz of hops in the kettle. For me it just helps to minimize loss of volume at transfer. I also use a bag to put around my racking cane when kegging beers that I dryhopped. Its like a filter.
Homebrewing,3dit30,Sly13adger,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:33 2015 UTC,"I've never used them but I've also never dry hopped a keg. If you're refining with gelatin with a cold crash, just be really careful when siphoning to a bottling bucket or keg. If you watch your stream and don't see a line full of sludge, you should be clear. However, at the end of the day, you still have beer. RDWHAHB"
Homebrewing,3dit30,PhlegmPhactory,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"I always dry hop in the keg, so I double bag my hops and sink them with some sanitized ss nuts.  I don't use any in the boil. I tried a DIY hop spider once but it ruined my utilization, and I have never had an issue with hop trub from the boil.  When I used to dry hop in the fermenter I would just put a fine mesh bag around my siphon to filter them out."
Homebrewing,3dit30,darthKOTOR,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"You say it ruined your utilization? How do you measure that? I have heard a few people claiming that you lose the aroma, flavor, and bittering when using bags and spiders but I have made many beers, plenty bitter and aromatic, with bags (I use a counterflow chiller and hops just can't get it there or else it'll be bad news)."
Homebrewing,3dit30,PhlegmPhactory,2,Thu Jul 16 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with my system. I use an e-kettle that doesn't have a super vigorous boil, and I have to keep the spider away from the elements. I made an IPA that I have made a bunch of times with reasonable consistency, this time the hop presence just wasn't there."
Homebrewing,3dit30,darthKOTOR,2,Thu Jul 16 19:05:12 2015 UTC,Ah. Electric is a whole different beast. Makes sense if you are super limited in space for it to move. How dirty do your elements get?
Homebrewing,3dit30,PhlegmPhactory,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:36:31 2015 UTC,"If I stick to a 60 minute boil and scrub them down right away they clean no problem.  If I go much longer they start to get dark and I need to let them soak in white vinegar overnight.  They are the standard high-watt density 2000w ones from the local hardware store.  The only time I have had noticeable off flavors was when I had a 3 hour boil due to extenuating circumstances (children).  It actually tasted like I used smoked malt and was well received.   As much as I would like to get the low-watt density elements, they aren't cheap and I have a number of other things I would rather spend the $80 on."
Homebrewing,3dit30,Darthtagnan,2,Fri Jul 17 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"Nah, less hassle and I feel that the bags contain them too much and don't allow as much utilization, but that's anecdotal. A good cold break and whirlpool and/or side pickup tube keeps most of it out of the fermenter, but for whatever does make it in, I don't worry about it all that much."
Homebrewing,3dit30,TheDarkHorse83,2,Thu Jul 16 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"I do not have any pumps, so if I'm using leaf hops, I'll use a spider w/ bag in the boil. I use bags for dry-hopping and fruit."
Homebrewing,3dit30,beericane,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:20 2015 UTC,For boiling? Nope.   I used to and it was a pain in the ass. Stopped caring about if hop gunk got in the fermenter and I've never had an issue since. Beers still taste great and it eliminates a cleaning step.

Homebrewing,3diom6,Barrybrew,3,Thu Jul 16 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"Well, they are very different yeast strains. Both have English roots. 1272 is the strain from Anchor's Liberty Ale, and many say it originated in England. 1332 is from an American Brewpub, but definitely came from England (Gale's Brewery). 1272 is pretty clean, unless you ferment it high. 1332 is going to give you a malty body and fruity esters at just about any temp (if you take it low, you get sulfur). The other interesting thing about 1332 is that while the yeast in suspension drop hard, especially if you cold crash, the thick, rocky krauesen seems to take forever to fall -- to the point that I have to shake the fermentor to break it up.  With both, just follow normal yeast handling protocol, and ferment in the temp ranges, allow then to rise to 70-72°F when fermentation seems to be just about over. They are both hard floccers."
Homebrewing,3diom6,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"Been a while since I've used it, but pitch from a starter, aerate, start cool, let it rise towards the end. Just like I'd do for 1272 or 1056."
Homebrewing,3diol2,BaggySpandex,3,Thu Jul 16 16:13:25 2015 UTC,"If you can't boil that much,  look into an electric heat stick.    Put auminum foil across the stovetop,  will make it easier to clean if you have a boil over and you'll be happy you did this the one time it happens.    Make a simple swamp cooler to maintain cool fermentation temps."
Homebrewing,3diol2,pricelessbrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! Would you recommend something like a food grade 3 gallon bucket for primary? Seems like it would be easier to clean than using my 4.5 gallon glass carboy.

I was able to get to lean into the tub and clean with ease."
Homebrewing,3diol2,Frozen_Brownies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:18:00 2015 UTC,I'll have to look into an attachment for my shower. Sounds like a good idea. After a PBW/OxyFree soak I assume it should be fairly easy cleanup without any scrubbing necessary.

Homebrewing,3djcbm,FoleyisGood,2,Thu Jul 16 21:35:13 2015 UTC,I'm still a noob but here is my 2 cents:  Get a book like How To Brew. I'm currently reading it. Another good one (I think) is The Joy of Homebrewing. I've never read it but those two get recommended a lot.   I would start with a 1 gallon kit. You might not even like brewing after all. So why go through all the trouble to brew five gallons the first time (some people will disagree)? Brooklyn Brewshop has 1 gallon kits (I started out with one). They are decent but they are off in what you need for equipment. You need to buy a few other things. Northern Brewer has 1 gallon kits that look to be better than what Brooklyn Brewshop offers.
Homebrewing,3djcbm,NDAugustine,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"I think this is really solid advice for two reasons. First, it gets somebody into all grain immediately and skips over extract. Too many people hold up all grain brewing as this mythically difficult thing to pull off, so they stick with extract forever. This is chronological arrogance, but I figure if some dudes in the 8th century with no modern technological advantages could make drinkable beer from grains, water, hops, and yeast, I probably can too.   Second, the one gallon batches allow most people to brew more frequently, which is needed in the beginning. Nobody's going to get good at anything they only do once every two months."
Homebrewing,3djcbm,gonemad16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:19 2015 UTC,Size of your batch really does not influence how often you csn brew.  1 gallon or 5 gallon i still brew at the same rate.  Just get less veer in the 2 gallon batches
Homebrewing,3djcbm,NDAugustine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:42:17 2015 UTC,It does often influence how much one can brew. Many people don't have the space or the desire to keep 20 gallons of brew on hand. But I can easily have 4 different 1 gallon brews.
Homebrewing,3djcbm,gonemad16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:43:55 2015 UTC,True.  I was thinking more on the fermentation side..  Time wise.  I guess im lucky to have a basement large enough for as many brews as i want

Homebrewing,3dis4n,Thatguyaric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"The SG scale on many refractometers is plain wrong, especially at higher gravities. The reason for this is that the makers used a cubic equation for converting from Brix to SG published in BYO, but they used the free, online pages that were unable to render the squared (2) and cubed (3) denotations. So that's one disadvantage to the SH scale.  The other disadvantage of the SG scale is that you need to use the Brix scale to plug OG into a refractometer calculator anyway.  The advantage of the Brix/Plato scales (and they are so close as that the difference is not meaningful in homebrewing) is that it gives you a percentage of dissolved extract, and this can be useful if you are a metric brewer. I don't understand the metric brewing stuff yet."
Homebrewing,3dis4n,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"So on a larger scale, Plato is the way to go, but on a 5-gallon system, I should stick with Brix? Thank you for your knowledge, sirs!"
Homebrewing,3dis4n,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"The deviation between Brix and Plato is pretty inconsequential for most homebrewers: the deviation is and ~ 0.0016 SG at SG 1.040 and ~ 0.004 SG at SG 1.100.  Because refractometers are calibrate in Brix, that's what we use."

Homebrewing,3dis4n,mutedog,2,Thu Jul 16 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"it's easy to convert between kilos and grams in your head on the fly since you're just moving decimal points around. Not so easy when dealing with ounces and pounds, also are those liquid ounces or weight ounces etc."

That's a pretty big advantage, I think.  I still don't think in terms of metric, like if you told me that some place was 45 kilometers away I'd have no idea how far that was."

You're as familiar with it as I am, then. Which is to say, not intimately but enough to find it easier for certain applications.   It is an advantage, but only because we've become familiar with it. For anyone that hasn't, it can't be an advantage, can it?  This is silly though, I agree there is an advantage long as you take the time to learn a little about the metric system. That's why I do it."
Homebrewing,3dis4n,chino_brews,2,Fri Jul 17 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"One advantage of using kilos and grams in brewing is the ability to adjust ingredient quantities without dealing with 1/16th pounds (i.e., ounces), which is why Jamil Z and the rest of the main crew on Brewing Network are always banging the gong for doing ingredient quantities in grams.  If you do carbonation calculations in g/L, it's super easy.  Doing starter wort calculations is way easier in metric. Who can quickly tell me how much DME I need to make 54 oz. of starter wort? But it's easy for the equivalent 1596 ml --> 160 mg of DME gets you a ~ 1.037 wort."
Homebrewing,3dis4n,Fenix159,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"The advantage is convenience and ease of conversion. But this only applies if you're familiar with metric.  I use it, but for someone that's never used metric before would it be easier? Of course not.  Same for SG vs Plato far as I'm able to tell."
Homebrewing,3dis4n,mutedog,2,Fri Jul 17 00:25:54 2015 UTC,So is there an advantage of convenience and ease of conversion using Plato over SG if you were to become familiar with it?
Homebrewing,3dis4n,Fenix159,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:15:21 2015 UTC,To me? There isn't. Ask a pro brewer that hasn't used SG before and you'd probably hear different though.   Seems all the pro brewers I've heard talk about it always use Plato and when I've heard it asked why they don't use SG it's always been Plato is just easier and makes more sense to them. So I dunno.
Homebrewing,3dis4n,Fenix159,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:42 2015 UTC,"Cool, so it's just a preferential thing.   I've just seen both of them used in different applications. It seems like commercial breweries utilize Plato, while home brewers utilize SG. I didn't know if there was more specificity with Plato vs SG."
Homebrewing,3dga7k,0osimo0,4,Thu Jul 16 01:11:38 2015 UTC,"Is that Chip Walton narrating?  Also is that bit about high cell death when sprinkling on the wort, true?  I have seen the xbeeriment and done it my self with no ill effects."
Homebrewing,3dga7k,Z-and-I,7,Thu Jul 16 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, ~50% of the cells die.  The reason the beer still ferments ""with no ill effects"" most of the time is because yeast are wee little superheroes and generally get the job done. But you can save them a lot of struggling if you just rehydrate first.  Do you want to make baby yeast cry? After all they've done for you? Always rehydrate."

ExBEERiments are totally rad, no doubt, and I always love reading them. However, using them as your only touchstone of brewing research is poor practice, IMO."
Homebrewing,3dga7k,TheReverend5,5,Thu Jul 16 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, and yes.  It is estimated that you lose up to 50% of the yeast doing it this way, due to the osmotic shock of rehydrating in a high sugar solution."
Homebrewing,3dga7k,angry_krausen,2,Thu Jul 16 02:11:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detail. It's a shame the video didn't mention this because step 1 of the rehydration looks exactly the same as sprinkling into wort.
Homebrewing,3dga7k,ExdigguserPies,3,Thu Jul 16 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, that part about cell death is true. ""Science Brewer"" did some experiments and found that 40-50% of cells died in a hemocytometer count after sprinkling into wort."

Homebrewing,3dff08,Sikario1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"First off, attend off flavour seminars. If that is not a possibility then buy at least two off flavour kits. I know it's a lot of money but if you are serious about being in the industry, you need to do it. The threshold of the spikes was so faint the first time I smelled them I couldn't detect anything.  Along with the off flavour tasting just get a better sense of what each style is about. When you go out for a beer look at the bjcp guidelines. There's a great app for it I highly recommend downloading for bjcp styles. As far as studying goes just do a little bit each day. Styles and Service are worth most on the exam, so I would pay a bit more attention to those. Anything in the draught quality manual was fair game, even calibrating pressure for draught at different elevations."

Homebrewing,3dff08,felchingbob,2,Thu Jul 16 02:45:37 2015 UTC,"In terms of bjcp they didn't talk about gravity at all. If any, they would say relatively high or low but never exact numbers. As far as other numbers go, there were some fairly direct questions in terms of abv/ibu/srm. One of my essays was on the traits of the German Pilsner. I had to give approximate ranges for those stats. History of the style was just as important as stats though. I remember one question being about a British style that was historically soured in barrels and aged for several years but by today's standards was not sour (old ale).  As far as books, Tasting Beer by Randy Mosher, The brewmaster's Table by Garret Oliver, and the draught quality manual are must reads. I also have the Study guide that was released.

I have a science background so I wanted it half lab, half brewery, all man cave.  It's a 10'x14' section of a 3 bay garage.  The garage had a extra deep bay in it I was able to wall it off to make it it's own room.  It was in a new home so I was able to get a sink hookup plumbed and extra outlets on a dedicated breaker.  I coated the floor with Euco Diamond Hard concrete densifier.  It makes the floor impervious to water and eliminates any dusting so the floor will stay intact for years.  It has made for really easy clean up.  The brew stand is 2-tier automated propane HERMS system which I had a friend weld up for me.  It's been going strong for 3 years now, I love the design.  I found a 3-bay stainless sink on Craigslist for $300.  This has to have been the best addition and makes cleaning sooo much easier.  Ventilation is accomplished via a 1500 cu ft/min attic fan which I place in the window on brew days.  Soon i'd like to add a dehumidifier to combat the warm humid southern summers.  I have a 4 tap keezer on the outside of the room.  I plumbed a CO2 line into the brewery to help with transferring beer into kegs.  I'm trying to minimize O2 contact.    This is a shit load of stuff for 5 gallons of beer.  It keeps the brewing out of the house so the fiance is happy."

Homebrewing,3dhd9z,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:18:51 2015 UTC,Also a great read for a novice is /u/oldsock's 11 Mistakes Every New Homebrewer Makes.
Homebrewing,3dhd9z,vinpaysdoc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:42:58 2015 UTC,"First, do read How to Brew linked below. If you like to geek out and think you are really going to get into it, then, go to a local homebrew store or club. Watch someone brew and find out about their equipment. You could also look over some of the old Advanced Homebrewers Round Table discussions where some brewers list their gear and process. You can make this (or any hobby) as cheap or expensive as you like.   If you want more freedom with ingredients, I'd suggest that you going ahead and start out brewing all-grain as that will give you the most options to tinker with your beer.   Things you'll need to decide:  What batch size do you want to brew? 1 gallon, 5 gallon, 10 gallon?  Each has their merits and drawbacks. You get roughly ten 12 oz bottles per gallon. The smaller size allows you to brew more and hone your skills at the expense of a good bit of work that is quickly consumed. Five gallons allows you to brew either inside or outside in most circumstances (some stoves won't boil 7 gallons of wort), and it is fairly easy to scale up to 10 gallons if you find you need more beer later.  Brew inside or outside?   Some use the stove to boil (I do), but it only works with volumes for 5 gallons or less (with some exceptions). You can also get propane burners for use outside if you want to experience the great outdoors or if, say, a housemate can't stand the smell of wort boiling. Also, you'll likely need to be outside if you are going to do 10 gallon batches.  Those questions would be the first couple in my decision tree. Start with How to Brew and look over some of the equipment folks use on ABRT. Go to a local homebrew shop or local club and ask to watch a brew day with someone. Good luck and enjoy yourself!  BTW, here's my ABRT. Most of the DIY equipment I use has links if you're so inclined."

Homebrewing,3dhd9z,TheDarkHorse83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:23:07 2015 UTC,That depends on what volumes and type of brewing you want to do. You will still need a kettle to boil in. You might also need a mash tun if you plan to do all-grain brewing.
Homebrewing,3dhd9z,TheDarkHorse83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:04:41 2015 UTC,"The cheapest way to start is with a one gallon batch on your stove top. You really shouldn't need much equipment beyond than a few pots from your kitchen. Once you know that you really enjoy it, you can scale up."
Homebrewing,3dhd9z,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:11:18 2015 UTC,What would you recommend to buy to ferment? Thank you for your response :D
Homebrewing,3dhd9z,chino_brews,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:56:47 2015 UTC,Homebrew shops sell 2 gallon buckets w lids predrilled for a grommet and airlock. Or you can get a similar bucket at Lowe's and drill it yourself.

Homebrewing,3dhab1,TheReverend5,3,Thu Jul 16 07:39:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, only flameout additions can be fantastic - it results in a really nice flavor + aroma profile. I've made smaller batches where I've only moved a hop addition to 10 mins for bittering and done the rest of the additions at flameout."
Homebrewing,3dhab1,TheRealFender,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:54:03 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've had nothing but good results with flameout/whirlpool additions.

Homebrewing,3dfoz6,sjmiller85,3,Wed Jul 15 22:41:27 2015 UTC,"Unless you plan on consuming it within the next 3-4 weeks (1-2 of which are for carbonating), don't bottle it.  The bugs that created that film on top are continuing to ferment, albeit very, very slowly.  If you bottle it now, there's a good chance it'll carbonate over time to dangerous levels.    Your three options: 1 - bottle and consume quick (if you've tasted it and are fine with it), 2 - dump it (if you've tasted it and it's terrible), 3 - learn patience and tuck it away, and forget about it, only long enough to refill the airlock every several weeks (if you've tasted it, like where it's going, and don't mind the flavor)."
Homebrewing,3dfoz6,TheReverend5,-7,Wed Jul 15 23:07:49 2015 UTC,"Those ""bugs"" look a lot like mold, dude. And mold is potentially toxic. So that batch should probably be dumped ASAP and that carboy double cleaned and sanitized."

Homebrewing,3dh1ap,smiteme,2,Thu Jul 16 05:16:46 2015 UTC,"First off, congratulations to you and your soon to be bride.  Onto the problem... which is that your dispense pressure is way to high.  Kegging is a magical meeting of three variables, temp, pressure, and dispense resistance.  Setting everything else aside a minimum pressure is required to push your beer out of the keg against gravity, through the resistance of your bev line, and up to the picnic tap. (I'm almost 100% sure you're using a picnic tap).  So we have a minimum pressure to overcome dispense resistance.  Next comes temperature, which determines how soluble CO2 is under pressure.  This is where things go wrong.  Lets say you want an average 2.5 volumes of CO2 at 50 deg F.  You would need to apply 17ish psi to your keg.  To overcome the resistance of an average human standing with the picnic tap at approx. two feet above the keg using two feet of 1/4"" inner diameter bev line would require approx. 3 psi to produce a trickle of beer.  Your problem is that you have 14 more psi behind that 3 that is causing your beer to foam like crazy due to the giant pressure differential.  My suggestion to you is to force carb using the recommended pressure in the tables.  When you're ready to dispense, disconnect your gas and slowly (as in as slowly as you can) burp your keg to zero head pressure.  Reattach your gas at ~5psi (possibly lower, you want the beer to gently come out of the picnic tap).  The CO2 will stay in solution so long as you didn't violently burp or agitate your keg.  So on the day of your wedding, transport the kegs under carb pressure unattached to the gas.  Place them in their final positions, or close to their final positions and gently burp them down to 0 psi.  Reattach the gas at the dispense (~5 psi) pressure.  The beer will remain perfectly carbonated at this lower dispense pressure for the remainder of the day.  Finally, make sure to pay attention, as this day will be over in the blink of an eye.  She's a lucky woman, and you're a lucky man.  Good luck and godspeed sir.  Reference"
Homebrewing,3dh1ap,iBrew4u,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:14:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the thorough response!   ...  I was using a picnic tap to test the carbonation today, but I normally serve my beer through a keezer with 12ft of line on each keg (that's how I'll be serving for the wedding).   I don't recall where I read that 12ft was appropriate for my setup (given serving temp and carb psi) but I've found it works well in the past.  Is that wrong? ...  I'm on my phone, but I'll check out that table tomorrow, thanks for that."
Homebrewing,3dh1ap,KegOutlet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:33:28 2015 UTC,"Try cutting that back to 4-5ft of line, and lower to 4-6psi serving pressure. I think you'll see a big difference in doing that."
Homebrewing,3dh1ap,iBrew4u,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll give that a try.   It will be easy to do when serving for the wedding, but what to people normally do when having 4 taps in the house that have a pint or two per night being served?   Do you repeatedly switch between keeping it at 12psi for when not in use, then degasssing down to 5 when grabbing a pint? ...  Seems like a lot of waisted gas and a lot of effort.   Is there an easier way?"
Homebrewing,3dh1ap,KegOutlet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"There are two easier ways...  Keep your beer at a colder temperature so that you can achieve the same volumes of CO2 at a lower pressure.  Extend the length of, or change the material/diameter of your dispense line to increase the line resistance."
Homebrewing,3dh1ap,bendalevlogs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:59 2015 UTC,I think this is where my earlier online recommendation of using 12ft of line came from (which was serving beer well before)   I'm abkut to get home.

Homebrewing,3dgvhb,M2009,2,Thu Jul 16 04:16:46 2015 UTC,"So, have you ever brewed a normal cream ale before? Despite the misleading name, the cream ale style is specifically supposed to be free of flavors like honey and vanilla. Cream ales are clean, easy drinking ales with very little extra flavor besides base malt (i.e. 2-row or 6-row), flaked maize, subtle hops, and neutral yeast.   If you have no experience with flaked maize, I would try and brew a normal cream ale without a bunch of extra stuff in it first. Take out the honey malt completely. 2 lbs is way too much, and really shouldn't even be in there to begin with IMO. Save the vanilla beans for another batch. Try 1 lb flaked maize, 0.5 lb corn sugar, and enough 2-row to get you to an OG of 1.045 - 1.050."

Homebrewing,3dgvhb,reverendnathan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:18:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have some contributions, as this style of beer is a recipe I make yearly!  First off, you just need two vanilla beans. I make a vanilla tincture using the same method, and two is a lot. In fact, you may find even two beans will contribute too much vanilla flavor! It will dominate your overall flavor profile, which is why you need a malty backbone. With that in mind,  Ditch the honey malt, get some darker crystal malt. The beer I make in question is this clone of AVBC Winter Solstice, which has a huge vanilla flavor, but balanced out with some sweet body from the crystal contribution. If you don't have both 40L and 80L as ingredients you can get, then a 60L will be an acceptable substitute for both.  Because vanilla will be both a flavor and aroma contribution, you want to consider how hops will interplay with vanilla. I'm not sure if you even want to bother with any hops past a bittering charge, and even then, you might not want much bitterness at all! That Winter Solstice clone claims only 4 IBUs!! I charge mine up to about 20 IBUs or so, but bitterness and hop aroma are not at all integral to this style of beer.  Concerning maize: if you would like, I would consider ditching your plans and checking out the recipe I linked to. Flaked content may contribute to difficulties with a BIAB system. I do not think you need a lighter body for a vanilla ale. You, in fact, need a medium sweet body, like a classic British style, to complement the vanilla.  Finally, an opinion that errs on the side of semantics: I'd suggest a British yeast if you could hold decent temp control for the ferment. I think the phenols from these yeast complement the vanilla wonderfully, and you'd miss out on some of that with just US-05.  Alright, a lot to consider. Bump up the body, dial back the bean count, get some color from crystal, reconsider how to hop the beer, and think 'bout a more complex yeast. I love the vanilla ale I make. Tastes like cream soda with a thicker body and even more vanilla. Actually between you and me, since you are probably the only person who has read down this far, I fill a pint glass most of the way and then dollop a shot of Wild Turkey 101 into it. Makes a fantastic highball that then adds a complexity of wood and alcohol heat that really brings the whole recipe together.  Cheers!"

Homebrewing,3dg38o,LemonSocialGathering,2,Thu Jul 16 00:13:58 2015 UTC,So to follow up (I'm bad at reddit-ing. Major lurker.) I got all this stuff from a guy at work. I am a chemical engineer. I have brewed some but this is like going from the Little Leagues to the Big Leagues as far as I'm concerned.   My biggest concerns so far with this set up is the flow of the mash tun. I want to be able to do 5 gallon batches all the way up to full capacity of this set up (I believe around 20 gallon) What kind of spacing would I need for the two false bottoms? It seems like the top valve spacing would determine your batch size.   Thanks for all the help! Hope for a good discussion!
Homebrewing,3dg38o,juanbobo808,2,Thu Jul 16 00:20:11 2015 UTC,Why would you ever need two false bottoms?
Homebrewing,3dg38o,juanbobo808,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:23:05 2015 UTC,I guess that's not the best way to describe it. More like a false bottom and a false top. The top tray would keep the grain bed down when doing the reverse circulation.
Homebrewing,3dg38o,BrewN00b,2,Thu Jul 16 00:38:40 2015 UTC,...and why would you reverse circulation?
Homebrewing,3dg38o,BrewN00b,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:58:24 2015 UTC,"I guess my understanding was that reverse circulation increases efficiency, in that the upward flow of the liquid acts to suspend the grain beds, thus increasing surface area and therefore extraction. Maybe this is totally wrong just the mindset that the guy I got this stuff from was going for."
Homebrewing,3dg38o,BrewN00b,2,Thu Jul 16 01:19:15 2015 UTC,"I have never seen any brewing setup with reverse circulation and two screens.  Assuming you're going for a RIMS here, the more common design is a single false bottom in the mash tun draining directly into the boil kettle.  The boil kettle out goes to the pump, which circulates back to the top of the grain bed.  This way, you don't have to worry about trying to locate a liquid outlet at the top of your grain bed.  You are going to have to decide how you're going to sparge this setup.  As designed, you'll need to drain the wort into a third holding vessel while you heat the sparge water in the boil kettle, then add it back after sparging.  Or you could consider sacrificing some efficiency for a no-sparge method.  A third option is to heat the sparge water before the mash and store it in an insulated cooler, then direct to a sparge arm or the like.  Finally, your limiting factor in batch size appears to be the volume of your boil kettle.  At an approximately 20 gallon boil kettle volume, I would recommend making no more than a 10-11 gallon batch.  You can expect to boil off a little less than 2 gallons in an hour, so with the extra collected sweet wort plus the hot break, you're going to be pushing the limits around 11 gallons.  However, if you want to use fermcap-S, I'm sure you could do a bigger batch."

Plug these values into the spread sheet, then plug in your mash water, sparge water, and your grain bill. The spread sheet will calculate your pH.

Brewing careers aren't particularly lucrative and there are other paths into the brewing industry, i.e. start at the bottom and work your way up. Also, a number of other programs are being started at 2 and 4 year schools that won't necessarily have the cachet of a Siebel degree but will be significantly cheaper.

I don't know what to tell you. Many Belgian yeasts do a better job expressing that ""Belgian character"" when fermented warm (often when started cool and allowed to free rise). If you ferment cool, you may not get as much character. I think you'll be fine at 20°C ambient as explained above. If the beer is actually at that temp, consider measures to raise the temp, such as warm water bath, aquarium heater in water bath, heating pad wrapped around fermentor or under fermentor, moving to a warm place or near a light bulb (as long as you block light), etc."

Sort of one-dimensional spicy/pepperiness is what I got IIRC. It was a recipe of my own making, and you could probably call it a single or blonde ale.

Homebrewing,3dgc2n,gundog48,2,Thu Jul 16 01:27:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe I just did the conversion wrong in my head but those kegs are not a great deal. After buying quick connects and futzing around with the pressure relief valves you're looking at roughly $100 - 120 Canadian and at least 3 hours to fit new PRV. I can get used corny's for about $60 and all they need is a clean. If it's you're only option then go for it but I'd hope you could find something better.  As for the co2 side; the most hassle free way to carb is set the psi to around 10 psi and wait a week, if you're impatient you can set it higher and shake the keg. You can put the bottle in the fridge, you will notice a drop in the psi but that's normal and doesn't affect how much co2 you have. You must keep the tank connected all/most of the time to dispense your beer and it's OK if you need to disconnect it short term. Nitro isn't much different but you can't carb with Nitro so you would either need a mixed tank or a manifold to pipe in the Nitro."
Homebrewing,3dgc2n,bendalevlogs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looking at this, once you factor the shipping cost, £8 disconnects and and new valve, you're looking at around £66.50 when you can buy a refurbed one with all the bits for £70. I envy your cheap kegs!   With the carbing, what would 10psi give me in terms of vols? Do you keep it at 10psi for the dispensing? I'm struggling to differentiate between what you're doing in order to carbonate the beer and what you're doing to keep it presurrised enough to dispense. If I'm using multiple kegs, can I just use some kind of splitter to dispense 2 kegs from one bottle?  Thanks for your help, it's slowly becoming clearer! I can't wait to do some force carbing! I brew mead and want to get into cider, and I might finally be able to solve the problem of not being able to make something sweet and sparkling!"
Homebrewing,3dgc2n,bendalevlogs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:05:04 2015 UTC,"If you set the pressure and wait a week there is no difference between carbing and serving. I don't typically calculate volumes and that type stuff, I have things set to around 4°C and 10psi and simply adjust the pressure if I feel the need. If you want to run multiple kegs you will need a manifold, that's a fairly common thing"
Homebrewing,3dgc2n,bendalevlogs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:58:45 2015 UTC,"Fantastic! So work out what carb level I want, set the pressure and leave it! Only problem I see is if I had, say an ale or stout on one tap and a lager on the other as I guess they'd be set to the same pressure, shouldn't be a big deal though, especially if I nitro my stouts. I guess in the case of nitro I'd use the CO2 to hold it at pressure for a week, then swap it over to beer gas and set to the same pressure?"
Homebrewing,3dgc2n,SpyderFoode,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"If you want different pressures you'd have to use a dual regulator or a secondary regulator. There's tons of info if you google them.  As for the nitro; I don't use it so I'm not totally familiar with it. I believe you typically get a mix, 25 nitrogen 75 co2, and you would just run a gas line to the keg. I honestly have no knowledge about running pure nitrogen but I'd assume you would carbonate normally then switch over."
Homebrewing,3dgc2n,SpyderFoode,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I really appreciate you clearing these things up and it's made the reading a lot easier to understand! Nitro is normally a 70/30 mix I think. I believe you can run pure nitro in a special regulator that mixes the two, but it's easier just to get a bottle. I've found our local pub gas supplier and also got a friend who's a landlord, so we should be able to sort that out, hopefully at a manageable price!"

Homebrewing,3dg7n6,zlarson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:51:04 2015 UTC,My problem with that is that those seem even more of a pain to clean. Unless you can cut a door into the side or make or it so the bottom can flip out. That way you can remove the spent grain with our having to lug the whole thing around.
Homebrewing,3dg7n6,SlamTown,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:56:02 2015 UTC,"You could use a grain bag! Here's one designed to fit a keggle:  http://www.brewinabag.com/products/the-brew-bag-for-keggles  It's designed for no-sparge brewing, but I can't see a reason you couldn't fly sparge with it. You'd just need to be careful not to scorch the bottom of the bag when you heat the keggle."
Homebrewing,3dg7n6,chino_brews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:36:54 2015 UTC,"A chest-style cooler is better suited to batch sparging than fly sparging, that is for sure. I haven't come up with a solution to lugging the cooler yet. I just saw the Coleman cooler with the wheels today at Costco, and it seems less than optimal for brewing. Besides being rectangular, the spigot is in the back between the telescoping handle's rods, and the gutter inside was a lot shorter and shallower than the one on the non-wheeled chest cooler."

Homebrewing,3ddfvs,CentralCalBrewer,3,Wed Jul 15 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"This is one item that i tried to DIY with the pasta roller i've seen some people have success with, but i never got a good crush and it took FOREVER to crush even small grain bills. I went out and bought a barley crusher and its worked great for about 6 years now."
Homebrewing,3ddfvs,jjp36,2,Wed Jul 15 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, I went with a pasta roller as well; it wasn't so bad for small extract batches as all I was milling were specialty grains - in fact, the result was quite good, though I had to at least double mill it (once at a coarser setting, then a slightly finer one). But when I decided to go AG, it was hell to use because it was so slow.  Since we already had a Kitchenaid Pro 600 mixer, I bought the grain mill attachment when I saw it on sale earlier this year (I also want to make flour) - it's essentially a far better Corona mill: much sturdier and better/more stable burrs. As a grain mill for brewing, it's doing better than I expected, producing less flour than I thought it would at the coarse setting I use to mill. At $80 it's worth the price, but the regular retail price is $120 and I wouldn't buy it at that amount. Also, I would only recommend it for people who brew small batches (<3 gallons) as you may overwork (read: kill) the mixer's motor with a large grain bill if you try to mill everything non-stop.  The only DIY thing I'll be doing with it is building a larger hopper as it's pretty annoying to continuously refill that small hopper (it holds about 1lbs of barley).  Oh, almost forgot: the other grain ""mill"" I used was a blender; actually, at first a regular stand blender, then a magic bullet clone (which worked better than the former). If you do BIAB and you use a bag with a fine mesh, it does work, but don't expect to be able to predict your efficiency. It did make it easier on me compared to the pasta roller as it was much faster, making it possible for me to wait until I bought the above KGM."

I quickly grew tired of using a drill to power it.   My dad gave me a small motor and this article gave me enough guidance especially on sizing the pullies to step down the speed.  I used a heating vent to direct the crushed grain into the bucket.
Homebrewing,3ddfvs,cok666n,2,Wed Jul 15 14:03:55 2015 UTC,Nice! But to me this is not a small motor! ;) Do you know it's specs?
Homebrewing,3ddfvs,bitchkat,3,Wed Jul 15 14:11:00 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure but it came from a bench grinder.  I think its 1/4 HP and something like 1600rpm.  Its a lot smaller than the other one he gave me which is 2HP and 3500rpm.  I may have needed a bicycle wheel to step that down.
Homebrewing,3ddfvs,darthKOTOR,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"I tend to only do 5 gallon batches, so the standard hopper on my monster mill was satisfactory.

Homebrewing,3ddfvs,chino_brews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:26:19 2015 UTC,"Curious to see the responses on this one.  I have a MM 2.0 mill that I run with a hand drill.  It improved my efficiency and is one component that I believe has improved my beer overall as I'm able to crush grains when I need them and not have pre-crushed grains waiting for me to get to brewday.  One issue I run into with the drill is that it is tricky to maintain a consistent speed.  Too low and the rollers won't turn but a bit too much and they spin too quickly.  I have a motor off an old lathe and want to attach it to my mill, I know I need to reduce the speed and have read a few articles on how to do that but would love input from someone that's done this and any challenges they had setting it up."

Buy the newest edition if you stick with the hobby. You'll continue to refer to it years into the hobby.  If the technical approach of How to Brew is not your bag, try Charlie Papazian's classic, The Complete Joy of Homebrewing. Charlie has an infectious enthusiasm. Or the new intro book by Randy Mosher, Mastering Homebrew. Randy is a former graphic artist, and it's visually the most appealing book. All three of those authors are giants in the hobby.  Also, read this excellent 2-page synopsis of the extract + specialty grains brewing method.   I don't have any friends that would really want to participate ...  Any tips are appreciated!   Well, make friends with your LHBS, and take a sample from each batch to be evaluated there."

Homebrewing,3deh6k,MillionMonkeyArmy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:16 2015 UTC,Thanks guys! I appreciate the help... I will try to post a follow up after my first brew! Cheers!
Homebrewing,3deh6k,thebottlefarm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"I think there are two primary books you can read about getting started brewing.   Palmer, which folks on the more technical / engineering side lean toward.  Or the more free form, Papazian method / mantra, in The Complete Joy of Homebrewing.  Both are good, I enjoyed both. I reference Palmer, but I got a easier high level understanding with Complete joy of.  I'd say go to a place where you can check out both and pickup the one you like. For brewing extract beers, the second book I'd suggest, would be brewing classic styles, which has good brewing info in the forward, and award winning recipes for all the 2008 BJCP styles."
Homebrewing,3dfv6r,S7R4nG3,2,Wed Jul 15 23:08:45 2015 UTC,I've was asking myself the same question with my new fermentation chamber. I'm thinking though that having the fan running while the compressor is off would just serve to transfer more heat to the kegs. Right?
Homebrewing,3dfv6r,pajamajamminjamie,2,Thu Jul 16 00:07:06 2015 UTC,"I would think so, convection does work both ways..."
Homebrewing,3dfv6r,jwalkermed,2,Thu Jul 16 00:47:09 2015 UTC,don't know.  i run run mine constantly.  works okay for me.
Homebrewing,3dfv6r,jwalkermed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:02:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, I mean the convection does work both ways, but you'd still have a more even temperature distribution overall running it constantly.  However, I'm gonna have my temp probe stuck to the side of keg, so I don't know if the air temp distribution would offset just running the fan with the compressor...  I'm getting that ""there's no right answer here"" feeling..."
Homebrewing,3dfv6r,thebottlefarm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:49:35 2015 UTC,when i wasn't running the fan my lines at the top of my keezer were warmer by several degrees and I was having foaming issues.  That fixed it.  Alternatively you could run longer lines I suppose but you are pouring warmer pints.
Homebrewing,3dfnf8,tomhawk24,2,Wed Jul 15 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"Seems like it would work, but you gave a link to Amazon U.S. and the plug receptacle (outlet) looks British.   If that's going to be an issue, consider the new ITC-308 by Inkbird, the same people who converted the STC-1000 to be dual Celcius/Fahrenheit and renamed it ITC-1000. I'm not aware of any reviews of the product on this sub, but the ITC-1000 is legit so Inkbird's got some credibility."
Homebrewing,3dfnf8,chino_brews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:57 2015 UTC,That would be an issue. The ITC-308 has no reviews on Amazon... Any other recommendations for a pre-built system?

Homebrewing,3dfnf8,OutofReason,2,Thu Jul 16 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"Works just fine for me.  I have a small chest freezer that this has been maintaining at around 35 for a month.  The plug is some kind of universal deal but it definitely takes a 3 prong US plug.  I don't know how dialed in the inkbird one is but this one has several settings for min run time, cycle on cycle off, etc.  I haven't played with those setting much.  Only thing to keep in mind this doesn't heat AND cool simultaneously. One or the other.  And my running amps were less than the output - didn't check in rush though - I'm not sure my freezer listed it."
Homebrewing,3dfnf8,hbarSquared,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I bought a bigger freezer, so I'm worried about the amps. I am completely dumb on electrical stuff... Does this freezer run on too many amps to be used for this?"
Homebrewing,3dfnf8,freckleonmyshmekel,2,Thu Jul 16 16:31:57 2015 UTC,"It should be fine.  On the ""questions"" section of the site you linked, this is answered as either 1.35 or 5 amps, depending on who you believe.  Either way, it's under the 7 amps the temp controller is rated at."

Homebrewing,3dfn26,chino_brews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"When I used to use an ice bath, I did this a few times, but not into boiling wort. I used the ice bath to get the temps down into the 140s°F, and then when the temp differential between the wort and the kettle wall narrowed I dropped some sanitized water bottles or sanitized backs of very cold ice into the wort for a boost in cooling power.  I decided it probably wasn't a good practice, even though I got lucky in terms of infections. I moved on to just grabbing a bucket of very cold snow from outside (in the winter) and using that to keep the ice bath cold.   And then I made (poorly) an immersion chiller, and finally bought a well-made one.   I definitely recommend the IC as the first equipment upgrade for even small-batch brewers. In addition to the benefits of rapid chilling on your beer, it makes brew days more fun."
Homebrewing,3dfn26,Ainjyll,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"If I were to do it if first check the web and find a food safe plastic that can handle temps above 165. Then I'd find bottles made from that plastic. Food grade HDPE #2 might work well?   Then I'd chill the wort in a standard ice bath until it got to around 170 before putting the bottles in. As long as the bottles are clean, there's no need to sanitize them. 165 degrees or above will kill anything bad that might be lurking on the outside of the bottles microbe-wise."

Homebrewing,3ddb8q,Thurgeis,2,Wed Jul 15 11:11:41 2015 UTC,if you read carefully you will note they are constantly stirring while dry hopping at approx room temp. your results might be different based only on the conditions
Homebrewing,3ddb8q,fillmore0124,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"They absolutely will be. Ideally, you want to be bubbling CO2 through your beer during the entire dry-hopping period to keep the hops in circulation. This is actually not that hard to accomplish if you have some spare tubing and a CO2 tank; I've modified one of my conicals for it. Using this method, I think I see the best results after just 2-3 days. But if you're just letting the hops settle, and particularly if you're bagging them, I think 3-5 days will probably give you better results."
Homebrewing,3ddb8q,rrrx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:56:26 2015 UTC,What if I brew a second beer and use the first batch as my blow-off vessel? That essentially bubbles co2 for free through the dry-hop batch.

Homebrewing,3ddb8q,testingapril,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"While the total concentration was higher in the stirred samples, and near-maximum extraction was reached within 24 hours, non-stirred (pellet) dry hop samples also showed near-maximum extraction in a similar time-frame. So while OP might not have as intense of an aroma without stirring, he likely won't see any difference time-wise beyond three days in a non-stirred system. It appears that pellets' increased total surface area is largely what affects extraction rate, while agitation largely affects maximum extraction.  Edit: Although I'm not sure how a muslin bag would affect the extraction rate, since the data are on loose hops."

Warmer temperatures and loose hops (I.e.) no bag, also seem like to increase the solubility of the hop oils."
Homebrewing,3ddb8q,niksko,-9,Thu Jul 16 00:17:34 2015 UTC,It will affect the flavor but not significantly. Leaving it for a couple of weeks is a much more common dry hopping length of time.
Homebrewing,3ddb8q,beerglut,3,Wed Jul 15 12:15:07 2015 UTC,Leaving it for a couple of weeks is a much more common dry hopping length of time.   I disagree with this. Everything I've read seems to say that after about 4 or 5 days there's a chance of extracting grassy flavors. I've also seen proper research conducted that says that most of the hop compounds are extracted after a few days.
Homebrewing,3ddb8q,trimalchio-worktime,2,Wed Jul 15 11:31:50 2015 UTC,Perhaps this is more of an issue with some varieties and less so with others.  I have dry hopped for 10 days without even a hint of grassiness.  Also Hops bound tightly in muslin bags are also less likely to release their goodness (or badness for that matter) so readily.
Homebrewing,3ddb8q,Wich3r,0,Wed Jul 15 11:59:42 2015 UTC,I get lazy and dry hop for really extended periods... I think there have been hops in one of my beers for a month already... and it's not grassy or vegetal or anything else annoying. The biggest problem with leaving it on hops is the foaming and downtube blockage
Homebrewing,3ddb8q,Beer_Is_Food,2,Wed Jul 15 13:15:40 2015 UTC,weeks? seriously? after a week you can already get herbal/grassy flavor instead of fresh hop aroma.

Homebrewing,3dbysb,nutron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"So keeping your finger on creates pressure that stops the CO2 from releasing from the beer, also reducing foam production?    Did you drill the stopper yourself? If so what size/type of bit."
Homebrewing,3dbysb,oh_hai_dan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, keeping finger does exactly that. Then you just release a bit of air as it fills up. You can see in my photo how low the foam level is (and thats without even reducing my serving pressure).  The #2 stopper came pre-drilled for an airlock to be inserted, as for the air needle I used as sewing needle heated with a lighter to create my additional hole. It goes through easily once its nice and hot.  Edit: As for oxygen exposure, I just let foam fully fill the head space in the bottle and cap. Might not be perfect but I think it is plenty sufficient."
Homebrewing,3dbysb,nutron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty easy too, to control these to get the right amount of foam in the neck of the bottle.

Homebrewing,3dbysb,beericane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:45:42 2015 UTC,This also works with just the tube and none of the hardware.   Just cut your tube at a 45 degree angle at the end to prevent it from becoming flush with the bottom of the bottle.   As long as you pour a pint for yourself first (to chill the lines) you'll get almost no foam.

Im trying to drink this young to get maximum hops flavor and aroma, so i was thinking of rehydrating 2 packets of yeast and pitching it so i could have a good strong ferment and keg after about 2 weeks maybe even less if i can."
Homebrewing,3dekl8,colonpal,3,Wed Jul 15 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"One packet of rehydrated dry yeast should be totally fine for a 5ish gallon batch, as long as it's not a 3 year old packet. The big thing is, don't rush it.  You may be eager to get it in to the keg, but let the yeast do it's thing until it's done and ready.  Keep solid ferm temps too.  You can use something like I do, a blanket and several ice packs.  I just monitor it a couple of times a day and add or remove packs as it goes.  It's ghetto, but it's worked so far."
Homebrewing,3dekl8,cok666n,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it's a pretty good base recipe for what you want to do. I usually add a 5% of Munich to my IPA/Pale Ales, it supposedly gives a maltier taste (never did a comparison though).  IIRC there is no ill effects to over pitching in the homebrewer scale unless you were pitching ridiculous amounts, and two packets is probably not overpitching for a 1.067 recipe.   Edit: Actually, according to brewers friend calculator, two 11g packets is still an under-pitch for a 5.5g 1.067 batch http://www.brewersfriend.com/yeast-pitch-rate-and-starter-calculator/"
Homebrewing,3dekl8,chino_brews,2,Wed Jul 15 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"Assuming that the question is, ""can you comment on the linked recipe?"", I would consider changing that grain bill.  Simple sugar is not needed for a moderate-OG beer like this. It would be more appropriate for an American 2x IPA. You should be able to get that attenuation with Chico yeast and good yeast handling and fermentation practices. Brewers in the U.S. are starting to shy away from crystal malts in American Pales of all kinds, and using more Munich. You could replace the sugar with Munich Malt. Then you could dial back the crystal malts to maybe 7.5% of the beer, and I like the idea of subbing C40 for C20 at low ratios.  Also, your IBU are off here. I don't understand how a zero minute addition adds zero IBU and then a whirlpool addition (30-minute hop stand) adds 40 IBU! The other hops are going to isomerize during that hop stand also, unless you're planning to filter the beer before the hop stand. I like to think of the calculated IBU as adding that much bittering, and then balancing this to achieve a BU:GU ratio of around 0.82. Your OG is 1.057, so your GU is 57, meaning your BU would be around 46-47 IBUs at that ratio. Of course, this doesn't account for any aroma addtions or dry hopping you do, and you can hit those fairly hard in an American IPA."

If you google ""BU:GU chart"", you'll get a chart that tells you the target for each style. You can also look at the style guidelines themselves, and if you're making a beer with an OG in the middle of the range for the style, then you know you probably want to be in the middle of the range in IBUs also."

You should consider doing a cylinder formula (or parabola is you're good at math) to find out what surface area you would need to wax to mimick a larger barrel. For a barrel that size, the answer will be something like ""almost all of it"".  And you can make whatever you want! You can always wash out the barrel a few times to get rid of as much of that RIS flavor as possible. By wash out, I also mean soaking the inside."

Now that you have the surface area of both, you can determine how much of the barrel you need to wax to ""match"" the oxygen exchange rate of a larger barrel.   Now, that's for the surface area of a cylinder, and a barrel is a parabola. I'm not good with math, so that usage escapes me. I'm working on it though!"

Homebrewing,3ddi25,cok666n,3,Wed Jul 15 13:25:35 2015 UTC,"Great suggestion, but let me suggest a tweak. The silicone baking sheets like Silpat are actually a laminate, and the middle layer is often not food safe, which is why you can't cut them to fit smaller pans. They are also too thin to be a good gasket.  Instead, OP can use look for silicone hot pot holders/trivets or silicone microwave mats.

I wouldn't trust it for a part that I was removing and putting back on often, but for a heating element that stays put, sure. I've used the same on stock pot lids to turn them into fermentation chambers, but the lid already had a handy grove to fill to create it, so no mold required.  You may be able to just put the element in, free hand around it with this, finger flatten, and let it sit and cure. Once cured, install the nut and tighten it up. May not look the best, but should keep it dry. Never tried it though, so making a mold like above would probably be a better solution."

Homebrewing,3dd8le,soeasy11,4,Wed Jul 15 11:24:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here. I got a 2-faucet system and upgraded to the Taprite regulator. I bought my actual kegs from AIH because they had the lowest prices on used pin locks. I think it shipped out the day after I ordered."
Homebrewing,3dd8le,VeggieAstronomer,3,Wed Jul 15 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"Just a general suggestion, pay a little extra and get a 20 lb CO2 tank. They are often just a few dollars more to fill/exchange than a 5 lb. See what your options are locally, don't buy a shiny new aluminum tank if you're going to have to exchange it. You can often find cheap used tanks on Craigslist."

I made the switch to kegging last winter and went with this kit: http://www.kegconnection.com/4-faucet-basic-homebrew-kegerator-kit/  I was too worried that I would forget to buy a fitting or something if I pieced it all out myself, and this has worked great since my keezer can only hold four kegs anyway."
Homebrewing,3de7u1,FermentingSkeleton,2,Wed Jul 15 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. It might have started slowly fermenting if something got in there, though, despite being in your fridge. You generally don't want to bottle a sour until it's ready, which isn't the same as a normal beer being ready (based on attenuation). Sour beers can work in phases, meaning you might be steady on gravity for a week or two, and then maybe some Brett wakes up and decides to drop you another few gravity points. At 8 months, you're probably done with gravity changes, but keeping it together to bulk age until you're happy with the flavour is highly recommended. You shouldn't need to add yeast at bottling time, though it might take longer than normal to carb. But that's fine with sours, they're a living beer :)"
Homebrewing,3de7u1,TheGremlyn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"Ok! I'll check the gravity on my amber regardless, just to see what it says.  As for the sour, I'll check the gravity again around the end of the month. If it is unchanged, I plan to bottle. The flavor taste great!"
Homebrewing,3ddvai,coucou22,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:08 2015 UTC,"The nylon shouldn't directly affect the flavor. After all, BIAB brewers heat their mash in nylon mesh bags, some brewers line their boil kettles or fermentors with nylon mesh bags to help separate trub, and many brewers use nylon mesh bags for bagging dry hops or other fermentor additions.  Will it oxidize your beer? No, it shouldn't as long as you keep air from entering the intake. If you do allow air to enter the intake, I could see the mesh making the oxidation worse in the same way the aerater on your kitchen faucet helps mix air and water."
Homebrewing,3ddvai,chino_brews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:39:59 2015 UTC,"Allright thanks, I usually put the nylon bag in boiling water before I start bottling so it should be sterilized and without any taste."
Homebrewing,3ddvai,whale-tails,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:44:36 2015 UTC,"I did this on my last IPA, I used the bag on the end of the racking hose, as I transferred from fermenter to bottling bucket. It ended up causing some aeration that i didn't think much about at the time. Ended up oxidizing the whole batch."
Homebrewing,3ddvai,whale-tails,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:48 2015 UTC,Why would adding a nylon bag cause more aeration ?
Homebrewing,3ddvai,dgerdem,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:53:22 2015 UTC,"As the liquid passed out the tube through the nylon bag it would create turbulence and suck in some air and create bubbles, until the bag was fully submerged. (It wasn't a tight fit)"
Homebrewing,3ddums,Jrock817,2,Wed Jul 15 14:27:59 2015 UTC,Here is the answer. Excerpt:  Electric based brewery: Divide the element size (in watts) by 17.6 to obtain the required CFM  (cubic feet per minute). In our case we use a 5500W element in our boil kettle. 5500 / 17.6 =  312 CFM. We therefore require a fan that can move a minimum of 312 CFM in order to ventilate  our electric brewery properly. Fans this size are readily available and reasonably inexpensive.
Homebrewing,3ddums,chino_brews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:37 2015 UTC,"Incredible, thank you so much for quick reply.  Maybe another question.  Do you brew more than 5 gallons?  If not, was a 220 necessary to get a larger plate to boil faster?  My panel is literally 10 feet from where I will brew so cost won't matter much. For the outlet to be placed.  I was also considering BIAB for the basement stuff, my ceiling rafters are low so I could set up a pretty cool pulley system fairly easily."
Homebrewing,3ddums,chino_brews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"Disclosure: I brew with gas, not electric.  But I know from looking into this stiff that a 220V, 20A circuit makes a huge difference trying to get even 6-7 gallons to a boil. It's a simple mathematical matter, right? 220V * 20A = 4,400 watts potential, compared to 110V * 15A = 1,650 potential wattage. If the cost difference is negligible, I doubt you are going to regret having more power or being your wort to a boil faster. The 3500-watt induction cooktops were barely $100 more expensive than the 1800-watt ones online when I looked last year."

Homebrewing,3dbqku,iBrew4u,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"I think I just have an inadequate understanding of how efficiency work. I figured it out based on this line in Palmer's book: ""To calculate your mash extraction in terms of ppg, you need to multiply the number of gallons of wort you collected by its gravity and divide that by the amount of malt that was used."" Which gave me 33. Palmer listed the potential efficiency of the pale malt as 38. I then thought that worked like a fraction to percentage, like 1/4 would equal 25%.  Where am I messing this up? Haha."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,Bartalker,3,Wed Jul 15 13:10:04 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, welcome to the wonderful world of all grain brewing.  Tips:   Keep notes!  Under temp on your predicted dough-in temp?  Note it and correct next time.  This is how you improve. Add all your strike water to your mash/lauter tun before your grain.  Put the lid on, let the temp stabilize, then dough in.  This will cause some dough balls, seek and destroy them. You have an extract potential of 1.0862 if this was a five gallon batch.  With an OG of 1.056, your overall efficiency was 64.9%.  Not bad for your first time out the gate.  Places for improvement here are ensuring no dough balls and proper batch sparging technique. (I'm assuming you're not fly sparging w/ no HLT)  Split your sparge into 3 parts, empty your lauter completely; add 1/3 of your sparge total, stir for a minute or two, empty completely; add 2/3 of your sparge total, stir for a minute or two, empty completely.  If you're fly sparging, match your inflow and outflow so that your lauter takes approx. 30-45 mins. Switch out your ""shitty hop filter/dip tube thing"" for a side pickup dip tube and embrace the whirlpool. Love the foam stopper and K&J rare earth button magnet used to secure the stir stick. If you're cooling outdoors, try and leave the pot lid resting on the top.  It won't stop everything, but your wort is wide open to infection in the pictures. Pick a topic (mashing science, yeast culture, water chem.) and do  a deep dive.  Learn as much as you can to encourage the aha moments that come with understanding all facets of the craft.  These will lead to better beer.   Most importantly, relax, don't worry, and have one of your tasty homebrews.  Best of luck exploring this wonderful craft."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,iBrew4u,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:34:29 2015 UTC,Can you explain why it's better to add the strike water before the grain? Is it to have less oxigen rising through the mash water while the latter is settling? I started putting the grains first thinking that there's less risk of denaturalizing the enzymes due to the warm striking water.
Homebrewing,3dbqku,beericane,2,Wed Jul 15 12:09:57 2015 UTC,"What u/beericane said.  The commercial brewery I've worked in established a whirlpool before doughing in so that the grain couldn't pile in one spot and thorough mixing was achieved, thus reducing (eliminating really) dough balls."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,OrangeCurtain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:35:41 2015 UTC,"Less chance of dough balls is the #1 reason.   When you pour water on top it naturally clumps. If you put the grain into water, you can make sure ever grain is saturated before adding more to the mix, you can stop to stir, etc..."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,iBrew4u,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:56:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in depth reply.   I did keep notes but I can improve there.   How did you calculate the extract potential of 1.0862? Beersmith said it was 1.063 and I wasn't sure how to figure it.  I am indeed batch sparging, but just did it all at once. Is the benefit of doing it in steps just better efficiency?   I'll look into your dip tube/whirlpool suggestion. Thanks. That's a problem I've been trying to solve.   Good tip on the lid while cooling, I think I'm going to try to do it indoors with the lid next time.   Thanks again."

I just set the Tot Efficiency to 72% and let BeerSmith do it for me, then I put the measured OG and Measured batch size in after brewing to see if I need to update my efficiency estimate for next time.  (1.056 / 1.081 would give me 69% though, so I'm missing something)."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,initjust4fun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"How did you calculate the extract potential of 1.0862? Beersmith said it was 1.063 and I wasn't sure how to figure it.   u/OrangeCurtain has it right on the long hand calculation.  But I would disagree with his leaning on BeerSmith, especially for someone just stepping into all grain.  I use Daniels ""Designing Great Beers"" extensively and would recommend the book to you and everyone else.  Understanding gravity units is just plain useful.  Everything from pale malt to table sugar has an extract potential per pound per gallon.  For example, if you mashed 1 pound of 2-row pale malt for a target wort volume of 1 gallon you would have a theoretical maximum yield of 1.035-1.037 SG.  If you mixed a pound of table sugar into a gallon of water it would have a SG of 1.046.  Lets drop the 1.0 part of the specific gravity and instead say that you have 35-37 gravity units (GU)'s of potential extract per pound of 2-row per gallon of wort.  We can now use these gravity units algebraically to answer questions we will encounter on our brew day.    For example, you just finished sparging and have collected 7.2 gallons of wort with an SG of 1.042.  Your target gravity and wort volume are 1.071 and 5 gallons respectively.  Are you going to hit your target gravity if you boil off 2.2 gallons? If not, how much DME must your add to boost your gravity? Well, if we had 1 gallon of wort at 1.042 we would have 42 GU's.  But we have 7.2 gallons of wort, so we have 7.2 * 42 = 302.4 GU's total in the kettle.  To determine our gravity at 5 gallons we divide our total kettle GU's by 5 because water evaporates and gravity doesn't.  302.4 GU's / 5 Gallons = 60.48 or a SG of 1.06048.  We are 10.5 points of SG shy of our target, so how much DME do we add??  Well, we want to boost the gravity of 5 gallons of wort by 10.5 GU's so we need 52.5 GU's total of DME.  DME has an extract potential of 1.045 per pound per gallon.  Therefore it contributes 45 GU's, and you need a total of 52.5 GU's, so you need 52.5/45 = 1.17 lbs of DME to hit your target gravity.   I am indeed batch sparging, but just did it all at once. Is the benefit of doing it in steps just better efficiency?   Yes, and this explains why.  This guy is amazing, period.  He approaches every aspect of brewing methodically.  You need to explore this wiki.  Some of this will make sense, some will be greek.  As you deep dive on specific topics you'll want to return to this source.  I'm trying to be more active in the community so feel free to ama, I love sharing knowledge.  Good luck and happy brewing."

Just because it can work without one doesn't mean there is ""no reason"" to make one.   At 1.063, if you had a yeast pack with 100% viability (unheard of), you still need 219 billion cells for the recommended pitch rate for 5 gallons. Without a starter you are pitching less than 50% of the ideal amount. And that's with 100% viability!"
Homebrewing,3dbqku,r-kellysDOODOOBUTTER,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:04:56 2015 UTC,"I think the main controversy over starters is the recommended pitch rates.  In my research, it appears that most recommended pitch rates are based on brewing on a commercial scale.    The effects of under pitching at the homebrewer scale are much less noticeable in the final product.  In fact, in my experience, I have not noticed any effects from pitching single vials/smack pack/dry pack of yeast in 5 gallons."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,El_Mikey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:08:43 2015 UTC,Isn't pitch rate linear? # of cells per ml?  I'm all for making new standards for homebrew but there has to be a reason behind it - like removing secondary fermentation from the process because homebrewers don't have the same level of hydrostatic pressure and heat to contend with that causes rapid autolysis.   What would cause the effects of under pitching to change from commercial to homebrew level if the pitch rate is the same?
Homebrewing,3dbqku,r-kellysDOODOOBUTTER,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"well, this is where the confusion comes in.  I'm not suggesting that any standard practices be changed, in fact I often use starters because it gives me confidence that I am going to avoid any potential issues.    First and foremost, commercial brewers need to pitch at a high rate because of time.  They need to go from wort to beer as quickly as possible.    Another major issue with low pitch rates on the commercial scale is infections.  The quicker the yeast establishes and begins to lower the pH and increase the ABV, the lower the likelihood of an infection."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,benjii22,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I'm never really sure and after reading around was kind of left with the feeling of, it can't hurt. The yeast vial wasn't quite cool when it arrived in the mail also, so I thought it might help make up for any that died due to that."
Homebrewing,3dbqku,Fenix159,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:01:58 2015 UTC,Use a yeast calculator - you really can't go wrong with a starter as long  as your sanitation is up to par.

Homebrewing,3d98jy,gibolas,2,Tue Jul 14 16:37:20 2015 UTC,My advice would be to pay extra for a 7.1 most homebrewers will outgrow this size quickly.
Homebrewing,3d98jy,thebottlefarm,3,Tue Jul 14 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't outgrown mine in 3 years, but to each their own. It is a little cramped for 3 kegs, but works for my needs."
Homebrewing,3d98jy,flexyourhead_,2,Tue Jul 14 20:27:27 2015 UTC,I was looking at a 7.1 on CL the other day. Do you know how many kegs will fit in a 7.1?
Homebrewing,3d98jy,clunkclunk,2,Tue Jul 14 18:37:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on the keezer. My 7.1 can barely do six ball locks with an 8"" collar. Most will top out at five ball locks, fewer pin locks."
Homebrewing,3d98jy,flexyourhead_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:44:30 2015 UTC,I would be good with 4 or 5. I'll stay away from anything smaller than 7cu. Ft

Homebrewing,3d98jy,zVulture,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:01:59 2015 UTC,Depends on what you use it for.  I have a 7.1 for my kegs because I need the extra space for cold storage.  But right now I could get this for fermentation space and go from doing one to two batches at a time.  Doubling my production/brewing and being able to do 10 gallon batches is quite a nice upgrade.
Homebrewing,3d98jy,gibolas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:55:16 2015 UTC,For people who will only have one I still think a 7.1 is better. For a little extra you get expansion space and wiggle room even if you won't use the space right away.
Homebrewing,3d98jy,zVulture,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:13:30 2015 UTC,Just got back and ended up getting the 7.1 anyway.  The 5.1 is just too small to handle two glass carboys without putting a collar on it.  For 25 bucks more it was worth the upgrade.  I didn't know the price difference was so small. I would recommend the 7.1 too
Homebrewing,3d98jy,SeventhMagus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:27:09 2015 UTC,My 7.1 only fits a couple carboys and a bunch of bottles.

Homebrewing,3d98jy,snoopwire,2,Tue Jul 14 18:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yup. The STC/ITC/RANCO etc controller work by just turning on/off the freezer via power relay based on temperature. No mod'ing required at all. Plug controller into wall, plug freezer/fridge into controller."

Homebrewing,3d98jy,pithed,3,Tue Jul 14 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Ok Thanks, I just purchased this. I had been waiting on purchasing this model because it is white and my husband is pretty adamant about getting a black one as it goes in the dining room/ home office but the black models are more expensive and have poor reviews (walmart).    It was just our anniversary though, so I am going to tell him he needs to make a cabinet / facade around it so if anyone has any pics of nice woodwork on theirs that I can show him that would be great (I have been getting some ideas using google images but thought I would ask here also). Having a picky husband is really hindering my homebrew expansion plans so any ideas on raising the SO acceptance on this would be appreciated."
Homebrewing,3d98jy,flexyourhead_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:20:43 2015 UTC,Have you considered appliance paint? A cabinet around it is tricky as it may affect insulation.  black appliance spray paint

Homebrewing,3d98jy,flexyourhead_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"That looks really good. In that thread, they mention the insulation between the freezer shell and the wood. You just have to be careful with it. It's not just the compressor ventilation, but the insulation of the shell as well.  What was the problem with the paint? I tried building a custom refrigerator into a steel cabinet in my basement. The insulation kicked my ass, so I'm leaning towards a keezer setup. Everything down there is black, so I was hoping to use appliance paint."
Homebrewing,3d98jy,pithed,2,Tue Jul 14 19:09:46 2015 UTC,My thoughts on the paint were that I didn't want to ruin the warranty but maybe I will just go with paint.  I tried it on another project and just didn't think it would look good enough for what my husband wants but he is really carpentery (ok yeah not a word) so thought he could make a good looking cabinet build that we could be proud to have in the dining room.
Homebrewing,3d98jy,pithed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:17:31 2015 UTC,The cabinet would be open in the back for the compressor.  I have tried appliance paint and did not achieve the results that would pass muster for this project. I am looking into vinyl wrap (like used on cars) as another alternative

Homebrewing,3d9eea,TheMacMan,25,Tue Jul 14 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"We've brewed some excellent beer in Antarctica!  However, lately the program has been clamping down on homebrewing. Lots of rules, rules, rules, and the latest is that brewing beer or cider is now a no-no. Ham-fisted or smart management policy, pick your adjective. Either way, the rules are heavy-handed.  The ingredients are usually hand-carried and packed in luggage. Typically dry malt, hops pellets or vacuum-packed.  Edit: brewing in a lab space is bad from any perspective. Many of the labs use toxic chemicals; food and drink are prohibited, for good reason. Better to store your brewing carboy and bottles in a secret closet or under a desk somewhere else. Better still, the USAP should lighten up and sanction brewing, allowing people to do it in the kitchen during off-hours. More sanitary, more fun that way."
Homebrewing,3d9eea,sciencemercenary,9,Tue Jul 14 16:45:11 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say that any beer that gets made on that continent qualifies as 'frost-brewed.'
Homebrewing,3d9eea,BeerDerp,8,Tue Jul 14 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"I agree.    From TFA:   “NSF officials acknowledged that alcohol consumption in the USAP can create unpredictable behavior that has led to fights, indecent exposure, and employees arriving to work under the influence.”   That behavior isn't unique to the USAP.  The prohibition policy they attempt to use as a solution focuses blame on the object and ignores personal responsibility."
Homebrewing,3d9eea,Arcka,9,Tue Jul 14 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"The prohibition policy they attempt to use as a solution focuses blame on the object and ignores personal responsibility.   Indeed.  Sadly, homebrewers on the Ice are typically the most responsible drinkers. They care about what they drink, and often share it in a congenial atmosphere. In general, you don't see them slamming a bottle of tequila and causing trouble.  That said, (IMO) it's naive to send a bunch of adults to the end of the earth, work their asses off, and not expect them to have some fun now and then.  The new rules seem to be a reaction aimed at protecting the NSF's reputation; we see this a lot. They're very paranoid about continued funding and how their work is portrayed in the media. By making a misguided rule and then sending down an inspector general, they should expect to catch rule violations. Cue a sensationalist rag like the Daily Caller to publish the juicy bits of the IG report and the irony is complete. It would be funny except all the rules adversely affect many of my friends and detract from the overall experience of working there.  </soapbox>"

Homebrewing,3d9eea,BeerDerp,8,Tue Jul 14 15:46:25 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, are you pissed off he brewed beer or something or what? The cost of homebrewing is peanuts compared to the upkeep for a base on Antarctica lol."
Homebrewing,3d9eea,drewbage1847,-12,Tue Jul 14 15:57:40 2015 UTC,I'm not upset he brewed at all. I just think it's silly to act like he's some poor victim that was punished by being sent to the Antarctic.
Homebrewing,3d9eea,absolutebeginners,8,Tue Jul 14 16:06:31 2015 UTC,"I think Drew was simply saying that access to good quality beer might be a little limited out there.  Doesn't take anything away from how cool (pun intended?) a job it might be, but as you know beer makes everything better!"

Homebrewing,3d9eea,MrKrinkle151,3,Tue Jul 14 17:53:58 2015 UTC,Rule fiend. Just because the rule exists doesn't mean its right.
Homebrewing,3d9eea,MrKrinkle151,9,Tue Jul 14 23:29:08 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean that being in a remote location for months on end (with no beer) isn't a negative aspect of being able to do so.

Homebrewing,3d9eea,TheReverend5,-9,Tue Jul 14 17:10:13 2015 UTC,You're making a lot of assumptions there. Many researchers are perfectly happy there and see little psychological toll from their time there also.

There was a story in the last year about a homebrewer in one of the U.S. Antarctic bases, so homebrewing was an open secret. In addition, I believe this story or another discussed commercial beer being brought (openly) on supply ships, so even if it's technically against the rules, the powers that be are implicitly sanctioning drinking."

Homebrewing,3d87fy,tallboybrews,7,Tue Jul 14 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"I have 3 questions for people who use fining agents like gelatin:  1) How cold do you need to get your beer after adding gelatin to fine it properly? I don't have a fermentation chamber and the best I could do would be to throw it in a bath with a ton of ice.  2) How does Isinglass compare and how does the process differ? I have some Isinglass and I think it says to put in x amount 2 weeks prior to bottling, but for gelatin I know people do it for a day? 2 days?  3) If I were to use gelatin or isinglass in a Hefeweizen, would it destroy the beer? I know you want yeast in solution, but I'm more interested in minimizing bottle 'trub' so people can drink directly out of the bottle (bringing beer for a big party without knowledgeable homebrew drinkers!)"
Homebrewing,3d87fy,My_Gigantic_Brony,3,Tue Jul 14 14:58:06 2015 UTC,I use isinglass. As cold as possible is better but <40 should be ok. 2 days is enough time.

Homebrewing,3d87fy,agsimon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"Mostly in response to 3: Don't worry about it. All the beer I brought to my wedding had very little to some layer of trub in the bottles. Most people drank away without a second thought. You can always try to minimize how much you transfer over...which is where aging/fining/cold crahsing can help. However, with styles like a Hefe, I would not even worry about it.  For gelatin, what I've heard (not tested) is that below 50F - with colder being better. However, I think I've seen people post here that they've used it at slightly warmer temps. I think an ice bath for 1-2 days would be sufficient."
Homebrewing,3d87fy,tallboybrews,2,Tue Jul 14 16:17:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm alright thanks for the responses. My first few batches have had quite a bit of trub because I've basically just bottled after primary (at ambient temp) without any cold crashing or fining. I don't really want chunks of stirred up yeast to be floating around when people are drinking! I'll certainly try to cold crash these a bit more than my previous ones though, I think it should be fine.  I do have a bottle of Isinglass though, so I'll probably use that in everything except the Hefeweizens."
Homebrewing,3d87fy,tallboybrews,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"For #1: As cold as you can get it. An ice bath would do just fine. Chill the beer BEFORE adding the gelatin; it works best when there is precipitate already in the solution for it to crash. If you add the gelatin before chilling, the effect won't be as dramatic but it'll still help."

Then I siphon the cold beer the next day into a better bottle with gelatin. In 48 hours or less, I have crystal clear beer everytime, it's like magic. Some beers I would have to cold crash for a week or more before they cleared.   Don't clear up a hefe, I'm pretty sure you would lose yeast flavor by dropping the yeast out of suspension."
Homebrewing,3d87fy,r-kellysDOODOOBUTTER,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:22:10 2015 UTC,Is there any way to keep a good amount of yeast in suspension but minimize the yeast 'trub' in bottle so people can just drink from bottle for hefe's?
Homebrewing,3d87fy,tallboybrews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:11:41 2015 UTC,"Well your always going to have some at the bottom. The stuff at the bottom is mostly yeast, and it's necessary because you need it to carbonate the beer in the bottle.  Only way I've ever heard of perfect bottled beer is to clear it up with either gelatin or filter it. Then force carbonate in keg, then transfer to bottles. Sounds like too much work to me."
Homebrewing,3d87fy,r-kellysDOODOOBUTTER,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:44:45 2015 UTC,That's true.. Do you typically find there is a small enough amount in your beers that you can drink it without any bad tastes?

Both photos were taken in the same room under similar lighting in the exact same (clean) glass.   This is a SMaSH Ale that I made a few weeks back as an experiment.   It turned out great.

I've never used gelatin but also cold crash and I have never had a problem with clarity. I actually get a lot of people asking me if I filter my beers because they usually turn out exceptionally clear.
Homebrewing,3d87fy,the_obbo,4,Tue Jul 14 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"I would like to see that as well. Maybe a three-stage comparison is in order next time I brew something this pale.   FWIW, I did observe a major change in appearance for the carboy pre- and post-gelatin. Post-gelatin, I could see the details of my hand through through the carboy. This was not the case before the gelatin addition. The sediment layer also became much thicker."

I used to cold crash only, and sometimes it would clear and a few days, sometimes a couple weeks. My experience with gelatin has been very consistent. Here's how I rush a beer to clarity:  Cold crash primary fermenter over night (for me, a bucket). Next day, heat up gelatin in microwave with a little water until it's kind of warm and mix it around. Usually like 30 seconds in microwave.  Dump gelatin into better bottle. Siphon beer into better bottle. Put the beer back into the fridge. Shit's clear the next day. 2 days to clear a beer, seriously. Now keg it.  I have had some stronger ipas that were heavily hopped and yeasty take 2 days on the gelatin, but never more than 2 days."

As far as just feeding the yeast to keep it alive, it's just as simple as what I described above. You're basically making a tiny beer in a jar, letting it ferment, putting it back in the fridge, and about two months later you pour off most of the beer, warm it up to room temp, ""pitch"" a new unfermented wort onto the yeast cake, let it ferment ... rinse and repeat. I use 1-pint and 1-quart mason jars for yeast.  Edit: just saw /u/rayfound's post and noticed you are making 1-gallon batches. His advice should be fine. Just use a yeast pitching rate calculator like this one. So if the yeast was six months old from date of manufacture, then 47 grams of dry malt extract dissolved in enough water to make one pint of wort, boiled for 10 minutes, chilled, and pitched with your vial and left covered with foil at room temp for 3-7 days (until fermented) will give you enough yeast to make a gallon of 1.050 ale.

Homebrewing,3d8tcq,blinky_bill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:48 2015 UTC,I am making an all grain recipe for a dry hopped pale wheat. I want to use German Hull Melon for aroma. What is a complimentary bittering hop for such a recipe? I am currently leaning towards .5oz magnum at 60mins- can you recommend something better?  Also going to throw in 8oz flaked oats and 4oz acidulated malt for a little more body / bite. Are these amounts going to make any noticeable difference in my finished beer?  Cheers!  *this is for a 5 gal batch. Other fermentables include 4# white wheat and 4# 2-row
Homebrewing,3d8tcq,Piece_Of_cake,2,Tue Jul 14 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"Magnum is pretty clean for bittering, I also like using apollo.   It's a really light beer in color and ABV. 4oz of acid malt is going to do almost nothing. It will influence your mash pH but its not going to make a significant difference in flavor in the end. 8oz flaked oats will help get that creamy flavor in stouts, it might not be what you want for a wheat. You might want to use flaked wheat instead."
Homebrewing,3d8tcq,bgramer1,2,Tue Jul 14 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"I would like to start a barrel-aging program for sours in my garage. There's two ways I could do it, first with an existing barrel that I've aged regular beers in, or a brand new barrel.  Option 1: I have a Woodinville whiskey 8-gal bourbon barrel. It's been used twice to age a stout and a wee heavy in the past 2 years. I now want to use it to age lambics, gueuzes, etc... What's the best way to clean the barrel and prepare it? Wouldn't there still be whiskey/beer flavors in the wood that could leech into my sour? My thought is that this might be better for darker sours/flanders reds, etc?   Option 2: Am I better off buying a brand new American Oak barrel and priming it with yeast starters/dregs and using this for lighter sours like lambics and gueuzes?  I'd prefer to use a barrel I already have since that's a cheaper option. If it is better that I start with a new barrel, where are the best places to buy it online?  Thanks for your help!"
Homebrewing,3d8tcq,TheGremlyn,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"No reason not to use the existing barrel. A couple of beers through it will take a lot of the bourbon flavour out of it, though you could always fill and drain a few times with clean water to get rid of some more, but I wouldn't worry about it and just use it as-is. A little whiskey flavour won't hurt your first sour."

For example: if a 10G recipe uses enough hops at 60 minutes to contribute 50IBUs, and I want to do a 2.5G batch, I'll switch the units to grams and add a gram until I'm at, or close enough to 50IBUs.   Brewer's Friend (and I think the other softwares do, too) has a scale function that will allow you to increase/decrease batch size automatically.

Your equipment is then limited to a couple of small fermentors, a 4-ish gal pot, and a manageable number of bottles (2 gals is about 21 bottles).

Yeah, warm temps/fast ferment (from simple sugars) will leave acetaldehyde (green apple) with many yeast strains, and boatloads of sugar would leave a thin body, which is going to leave a ""cider-like"" mouthfeel. Add to that a little residual maltose that didn't get fermented because the yeast was too busy gorging on simpler sugars and you've got 3 major contributing factors:   Thin Body Acetaldehyde Sweetness.    That sounds like apple cider to me.   0-25% table sugar added to an otherwise solid recipe? No issue, assuming the recipe was otherwise built to accommodate it.   In an extract IPA?

Back then, everything I could find on the subject was that it was caused by adding too much table sugar in a brew, and I did in fact put a lot of it. So it stuck with me.  It wasn't my intention to carry on a myth, but I always advised against using table sugar since then... I've read brulosopher's posts and I'm always suprised by how everything we learned back then is now false..."
Homebrewing,3d8tcq,MrKrinkle151,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"But it has nothing to do with table sugar per se, as the same thing would have happened with corn sugar. Too much was the key part, not the table sugar."
Homebrewing,3d8tcq,MrKrinkle151,2,Tue Jul 14 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"Cane sugar works just as fine as corn. The amount is based off of batch size, desired carbonation volumes, and residual CO2 in the beer. You can calculate this with a priming sugar calculator.  Edit: My dumbass read this as a bottle carbing question. Cane is still fine to use, just ignore everything else I said. Depending on the initial gravity (w/o the sugar), sometimes (especially larger additions) sugar is added after fermentation has begun in order to avoid needing to pitch larger amounts of yeast for the increased gravity or stressing them."

Opted for a fermenting bucket this time with a blowoff, so I can't see what is going on. When I got home from work yesterday at 5 pm, the blowoff reservoir was bubbling away and the smell was amazing. Looked again after my son's lacrosse game at 9:30 pm and nothing. No bubbling at all. Analyzing the blowoff tube, it is apparent the fermentation was VERY active at one point.

If I were making a 10 gallon batch, I'd just double everything and scale my hops when I know my alpha values. But I like things to be easy.   Definitely grind your dark malts fine, and if you don't like the dark malt ""bite,"" add them at the end of the mash. I enjoy the bite, so I usually don't bother with this.

Homebrewing,3d9j40,BeerDerp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:55:08 2015 UTC,"Keep it to 1lb of roasted barley.  Double the amount of roasted barley to 2lbs.  For both a 5 gallon and 10 gallon batch, if you can - use a coffee grinder to grind the roasted barley to as fine a powder as you can.  You want maximum color extraction here, otherwise your dry stout might end up on the brown end of brown to brownish black with ruby highlights.  Actually if you grind the roasted barley super fine you could probably get away with 1.5lbs in 10 gallons.  Also, a tip from Gordon Strong that has improved my dark beers immensely - don't add your highly roasted grains to your mash until the very end when you are ready to mash out.  You won't have to fuss as much with mash pH (dark grains are highly acidic), and when all is said and done, your beer will have a much more fresh, robust, and less harsh roasted taste.  Good luck!"

Homebrewing,3d9j40,MrKrinkle151,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:18:11 2015 UTC,For a 5 gal batch:  9 Lbs Marris Otter 1 Lb amber malt 0.6 lb black patent  Mash @ 152F for 60 minutes  First wort hop with 5oz East Kent Golding  60 min boil  Nottingham yeast
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,lizard_wings,3,Tue Jul 14 16:00:13 2015 UTC,"Hops?  edit: What was your process for making this? Typically you need koji, which you can make or buy. Then you need steamed rice to add to the koji. Then you start adding yeast, more koji and more rice and step it up over a couple days."
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,Piece_Of_cake,2,Tue Jul 14 17:36:02 2015 UTC,"Bought this then followed the directions the the back  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064OGDYS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00  Basically, it had me steam a pound of rice, then add the koji. After that, I let the rice sit for 30 hours and it would become malt rice. Then I steamed 4 more pounds of rice and added that to the malt rice with yeast, a gallon of water and either citric acid or hops. I thought the hops was kinda weird, but that's what the directions said so I rolled with it. Apparently the acidity they add is necessary.."
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,Piece_Of_cake,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"koji-kin to make koji. Hops might be a little weird, but it should ferment fine. Looks fine so far. You might want to strain and press it through a mesh bag before drinking."
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,mutedog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:49:55 2015 UTC,what temp did you have the rice at for your 30 hour koji incubation? If it wasn't like 90-100F and humid you probably didn't get much mold growth (AKA malt).
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,mutedog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I didn't really have the means to keep it extra warm, so it just sat in my kitchen. It was probably between 70-75  I actually did have a lot of growth for this batch. It was visibly bubbling, a lot.  Probably explains why my second batch isn't doing much..."
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,mrbrambles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:09:37 2015 UTC,you might want to look at asian grocery stores for koji rice or malt rice and add some of that. Worst case you could just get some amylase enzyme from the LHBS and add it.

Homebrewing,3d9lt3,blpsoup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:53:49 2015 UTC,Did you use whole grain rice or did you go out and find a source for milled down rice that is used for Sake?
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,mitchard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:01:28 2015 UTC,I just used sushi rice.
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, hopefully it was milled below 70% (70% of the grain left).  I have found a few sites that provide 60% milled rice but nothing below that unfortunately.  For now I just enjoy my Dasai 50 from the store hah."
Homebrewing,3d9lt3,gaodage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"It's not hard, so much as laborious. About 5-15 minutes per day for 3 weeks."
Homebrewing,3da6h3,indianajns,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"What form are you getting it in? I used Hop Shots for awhile, but I found them too inconsistent. Some smelled badly oxidized (darker color, and didn't integrate into the wort well). Hop extract is great, but I didn't have a good source for it as a homebrewer."
Homebrewing,3da6h3,oldsock,4,Tue Jul 14 18:39:33 2015 UTC,This is only place that I have seen that sells cans of the hop extract. http://www.farmhousebrewingsupply.com/ibu-injectors-150_g-can-new-larger-size/
Homebrewing,3da6h3,elreeso55,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:33 2015 UTC,Is there a good way to utilize that as a homebrewers? I would think it would go bad before you used most of it.

Homebrewing,3da6h3,Broham13,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:00 2015 UTC,Know the relative cost of same IBU from high AA hop vs the hop extract?
Homebrewing,3da6h3,turduckenpillow,2,Tue Jul 14 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"1 ml of this stuff will give you about 10 ibus in 5 gallons 1.050 wort, boiled for 10 minutes. If we compare this to a common bittering hop, say magnum, with an AA percentage of 15%, and assuming the same wort, we would need to use 0.2 Oz. Assuming an ounce of warrior is $2 it works out that  you'll spend 40 cents for 10 ibus of bittering. Now I don't know the volume of this can, but it looks to be the same of a large soup can. Those are about 2 cups, or 473 ml. 473 ""servings""  of 10 ibu, divided by $32 works out to about 15 cents for 10 ibus. If that can is bigger the cost will go down per 10 ibu."
Homebrewing,3da6h3,elreeso55,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"Seems like the right idea to me, but the math is a little off.     Magnum hops   $2/oz * 0.2oz/10ibu = $0.04/ibu = $0.4/10ibu   Extract   1 mL/10ibu * $32/473mL = $0.0067/ibu = $0.067/10ibu  So even more drastic than you had.  But, the product might be 150g.  It says 150_G, so maybe.  Density probably ranges from 0.8 to 1 g/mL.  So 150 mL to 190 mL total.    1 mL/10ibu * $32/190mL = $0.0168/ibu = $0.168/10ibu  1 mL/10ibu * $32/150mL = $0.0213/ibu = $0.213/10ibu  Don't mean to be a jerk and correct, but I just (at first) didn't see the volume per IBU for extract and didn't know how much hops to get same IBU."
Homebrewing,3da6h3,turduckenpillow,2,Tue Jul 14 22:13:43 2015 UTC,Did the division upside down ;) you're correct.

Homebrewing,3da6h3,ConvertsToMetric,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:23 2015 UTC,I use it on all my hoppy beers. I picked up a can from Yakima valley hops and think it was well worth it. I have noticed that the bitterness is very soft and makes for an easy drinking beer. I've been adding 5ml to 10ml (6 gallons) for my bittering additions though I think I want to up it to 15ml.  IIRC my extract is 61% AA
Homebrewing,3da6h3,JhonKa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:39:19 2015 UTC,I agree.  Seems less harsh.  I use hopshot and haven't noticed any oxidation yet as was mentioned above.  What are you using?
Homebrewing,3da6h3,invitrobrew,2,Tue Jul 14 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"I bought a can from Yakima Valley and portioned it into 10 ml aliquots in syringes. I found it kept well, and agree with other posters that the bitterness seems less harsh. I just recently depleted my stock and have been back to traditional pellets and, while I can't say definitively, do notice a little more bite on the bitterness, even if I've calculated the IBUs to be the same.   I really like it - I love cutting back on the vegetal matter in the kettle. Some of the beers I made (like a Robust Porter, for instance) never even saw green hop matter touch it - just hop extract at 60 mins and that's it. Could never tell a difference in a malt-focused beer like that. Oh yeah, cheap as hell when purchased in bulk. Like, really, super cheap compared to a comparable amount of pellets of leaf."

Homebrewing,3db57f,ntopliffe,2,Tue Jul 14 22:54:06 2015 UTC,Do you any type of tub or storage bin that will hold your bucket? Put it in there w/ice and water.  Toss a wet t-shirt over it so it will wick water from tub. Optional to aim a fan on low speed at it.
Homebrewing,3db57f,nzo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:48:32 2015 UTC,I think I've seen the tub trick with shirt wick.  I'll try to rig something up.  Thanks.

Wrong hobby.   That said, advice already given for how to brew things and what to get to start is solid. /u/brulosopher and /u/chino_brews aren't just recommending random crap. It's good stuff to read through.  Just remember, once you go down the rabbit hole theres no turning back."
Homebrewing,3dat3w,Fenix159,6,Tue Jul 14 21:30:14 2015 UTC,"Just remember, once you go down the rabbit hole theres no turning back.    Every time I approach the break-even point on cost, I realize there's some other piece of equipment I just have to have."
Homebrewing,3dat3w,BraveryDave,3,Tue Jul 14 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"Break-even point is a myth.   That said, I was there.  I was there, until my friend /u/Bretbeermann suggested getting a cooler MT because there was a good deal.   Then I was almost there again. Until I opted to get propane and a burner to brew outside, and a mini-fridge ferm chamber to control temps.  Early next year would be my next break even point given current brew schedule had I stopped there.  Now I'm building a HERMS setup.   Well, at least I've got fun toys. That's the way I look at it."
Homebrewing,3dat3w,Fenix159,3,Tue Jul 14 21:39:56 2015 UTC,I find the most effective way to make it cost-effective is to not add up my costs.
Homebrewing,3dat3w,TappedOut,3,Tue Jul 14 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"I am actually pretty certain I am getting the better end of the deal now. I don't care too much for gear upgrades.   Beer costs me $25-60 a batch, for 11 gallons all in.   Keezer is expensive, but that would cost just as much if I wanted draft commercial beer on tap.  Hell, in that regard, my kegs are cheaper than deposits on sankes, so no problem there."

And could I go without?"
Homebrewing,3dat3w,TheReverend5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've just googled and found this is so it can be back-sweetened without fermenting more.

Homebrewing,3dat3w,brulosopher,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"those may contaminate your cider unless you pasteurize those berries, just saying. and you may already know this, but the fruit wont sweeten it and will probably add a tart red berry flavor (which could be delicious)."
Homebrewing,3dat3w,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"It's used to halt the yeast so that it doesn't ferment whatever fermentable sweetener used to back-sweeten; you can ditch that piece of it and drink the cider dry or use a non-fermentable sweetener (lactose, Splenda)."

Homebrewing,3dalt2,MikeWeber1,7,Tue Jul 14 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"You reeeeeeeally don't want to pass hot wort through PVC tubing. You risk leeching all sorts of nasty things out of it. Besides which, this really wouldn't work very well anyway; PVC is not a great heat exchanger.

Homebrewing,3dalt2,CentralCalBrewer,3,Tue Jul 14 20:40:12 2015 UTC,Based on those pictures you're going to get almost no cooling power out of just passing through ice.  Work on making a copper immersion chiller as others have said.
Homebrewing,3dalt2,YouAreADickheadMate,3,Tue Jul 14 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"Buy or build a standard immersion chiller.  If you live in a warm climate with warm ground water, you can still use your cooler for a two-step cooling system. I do this in tropical northern Australia.  I use the water out of the tap to get the wort down to high 20s/low 30s and then I recirculate water through an ice bath (in a cooler) using a pond pump to get the wort down to pitching temperature.  I find it takes about 1/2 hour to get the wort down to 28-30c and then about 5-10 minutes in the second step to get the wort down to 20-21c. It works a treat."
Homebrewing,3dalt2,E5Scoot,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"I made a diy copper tube immersion chiller that connects to any faucet. I'd say it's probably easier to use, but you already have the parts for yours bought. So constructively id say you need more tubing, and should coil it in the center as much as possible. The more tube surface area you can get in contact with ice and water will cool it down much faster."

Homebrewing,3dalt2,blpsoup,2,Tue Jul 14 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"Since others have already mentioned materials and length of tubing, if you haven't thought of it already I would suggest a valve on the bottom so you can control the wort flow/output temperature."

Homebrewing,3d9xi0,lkacenja,4,Tue Jul 14 17:21:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think WLP644 is known for producing spicy or tart character, even fermented warm. It's really just fruity. I read the entire HBT thread on this strain and here's a comment summarizing my findings.  I've made 2 beers now and am about to keg a cider with this strain and my impressions are essentially that yes, it's very fruity and complements hop flavor well, but it takes forever to flocculate/attenuate fully, which I believe was previously assumed to be because it wasn't saccharomyces. All in all, it's probably not really a better option than other fruity strains."
Homebrewing,3d9xi0,jableshables,3,Tue Jul 14 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"All in all, it's probably not really a better option than other fruity strains   Totally agreed.  I'm also of the opinion that it's not very good unless the beer is heavily hopped. It doesn't do a whole lot on it's own. In other words, it's not a star, it's background vocals."
Homebrewing,3d9xi0,testingapril,2,Tue Jul 14 17:46:51 2015 UTC,Cool! Thanks for the responses. Sounds like I had a misconception about this strain.
Homebrewing,3d9xi0,testingapril,3,Tue Jul 14 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"I have to say that I've had a similar experience to you. when I've used it, I've gotten very little fruitiness from it if the beer wasn't also hopped to the gills. It seems to work really well with hops, but on it's own doesn't display much character.  I've got a Best Bitter recipe with it right now that's almost lager like.  Possibly if you under pitch it heavily and don't oxygenate you could get more character out of it, but for me, It's not one that I'll be leaning on in the future."

Homebrewing,3d8yu5,UnsungSavior16,2,Tue Jul 14 13:37:56 2015 UTC,"You might consider mashing lower. I typically mash my saisons at 149F to help dry it out. 3726 tends to be a little tart to begin with so you might not even need to do a sour mash. You could always add a smidgen of lactic acid or acidulated malt to brighten the tartness.  Personally, I'm not too much a fan of Sorachi Ace, particularly in higher quantities. I get a little bit of lemon grass and a lot of dill coming from it even in small additions.

I'm a very new homebrewer (recently bottled my first brew) but I want to plan a second batch of beer that I can jump into quickly. Brewed a hefeweizen with steeping grains and LME, would like to do another beer the same way but am unsure of the amounts of things needed. I'm hoping to make a bit of a Lagunitas CitruSinesis Pale Ale clone, because I know Pale Ales are another kind of beginner style. But I definitely want to experiment with adding orange puree or orange peels to a secondary fermentor or something. I'm guessing I should use pale and crystal malt for LME, what should I use for steeping grains? As for hops I'd like to go for some classics like cascade/chinook/nugget (whichever would bring out citrus flavor the best). Smooth profile over all, I'm not a big fan of high IBU. I'm willing to experiment with interesting yeast but I don't know much about the different strains. Any help would be appreciated! I'd be going for a 5gal batch."
Homebrewing,3d8yu5,TheManHammer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"Note: this is a hard cider recipe idea  I'm trying to plan ahead and start my Thanksgiving/Christmas inspired hard ciders now so they'll have plenty of time to ferment, clarify and sit.  Pumpkin pie has always been one of my favorite desserts and I want to try to carry over those flavors into a cider. I've found a few recipes around the web but none of them seem to be very promising (the results are really lacking pumpkin flavor). I'm hoping to remedy this by making a syrup out of the pumpkin and adding that to the cider.  Goal  Hard cider with creamy mouthfeel and hints of pumpkin pie. Reduce pumpkin spices to a syrup to condense the flavors and also add a “mouthfeel mixture” to help with the drinkability.  Test Size  1 Gallon  Ingredients   For the syrup mixture - 15 oz 100% pure pumpkin puree (Libby’s brand) - ½ cup brown sugar - ½ cup granulated sugar - 1 tsp vanilla - 2 cups water - 2 tsp cinnamon - 1 tsp ground Allspice - 1 tsp ground Ginger Make a “mouthfeel mixture” (to provide more mouthfeel) - 1 cup of water - 1 bag of black tea - 10 raisins - 1 key lime (juiced) 1 gallon cider ¾ tsp Wyeast beer nutrient blend 2 grams Safale S-04 Yeast ¾ tsp pectic enzyme   Steps   Warm 1 cup of apple cider and pitch yeast with yeast nutrient Make the syrup - To make the pumpkin spice syrup, combine syrup ingredients in a pan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and let cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally - Let syrup cool slightly Make the “mouthfeel mixture” - boil the water, add the tea bag, lime juice and raisins - let sit for 7 minutes Add syrup and tea (with raisins) to cider in the 1 gallon glass jug and shake to combine Take OG reading Add pectic enzyme Add pitched yeast, attach airlock and let sit   Estimated Fermentation   Primary: 2-3 weeks Secondary: 2 months?

Homebrewing,3d8yu5,turkeychicken,2,Tue Jul 14 13:14:16 2015 UTC,"This seems really complicated for a cider.  I'd also be a little hesitant to throw all that in there from the get go unless you've made this recipe before.  I'd ferment it out with the nutrients and pectic, then see where you're at.  Do a taste test with the tea and syrup to see what a proper dosing would be.  Then add it at bottling and use the syrup you're making as your priming solution, obviously adjusting the sugar content as required."
Homebrewing,3d8yu5,Uberg33k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:26 2015 UTC,"I was a little worried about the amount of ingredients too.  I wanted to try the syrup idea since every recipe I've read that calls for simply plopping the pumpkin puree in the fermenter says the flavor doesn't carry over.  I thought that by reducing it down along with some traditional pumpkin pie spices, the flavors would transfer better to the cider."
Homebrewing,3d8yu5,turkeychicken,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"I think it can work, the issue is just throwing it all in at once in the beginning.  You have no way to control the concentration of extraction at that point.  Dosing after fermentation or even adding the spices as you would a dry hop addition will give you a bit better control over extraction rates and the final flavor profile."
Homebrewing,3d8yu5,Uberg33k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:37:49 2015 UTC,Are you going to carbonate it? Or is it still?  If carbonating you could always use lactose to add mouthfeel. I used some in a graff last year that dried out a bit too much. It's excellent.
Homebrewing,3d8yu5,camkotel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:38:34 2015 UTC,I was thinking about the lactose idea too.  I've heard good things about it and I think it would go well with the flavor profile of the cider too.

At this point, I kind of want to insert the Fry meme (the ""not sure if serious"" one).    ~100 IBU is the upper limit detectible by human beings.  Yes, different people have different exact thresholds, but you are basically brewing a beer that is literally as bitter as a normal person can taste, but you're (a) worried that it isn't bitter enough, and (b) claim that you want to go on the lower end for bitterness.  Oi.  First off, I'd cut the 40 minute addition altogether.  You're not going to get much (any?) flavor/aroma from that, it's just bitterness - only not as efficient as a 60 minute addition.  Consider shooting for something around 60 IBU or so for a lower bitterness DIPA.  Consider really reducing that crystal if you don't want sweetness.  Maybe toss in a little victory or munich if you want a little malt complexity without the sweeter aspects.  Strongly consider adding some simple sugar, mashing cooler (no warmer than 148 F) - or both - to keep the body under control and yield a lower FG."

(Personal preference)  Second, I have a question about your volumes: Your boil size is 5.75 and your batch size is 3.5 gal. Do you really have >2gal/hour boiloff?"
Homebrewing,3d8yu5,redoran,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:41:13 2015 UTC,I thought it was high. Would you suggest just cutting back the Chinook bittering charge or cut back everything in proportion?

In total I have 2 oz CTZ (15.5AAU) and 5 oz Northern Brewer (7.8 AAU).   My thoughts due to hop flavor loss is to maybe just go crazy with them in the boil and potentially dry hop as well with anything left over.   Anyway, here is what I have to work with. Any tips on the hop schedule/amount would be super helpful! Still pretty much a beginner this is only my 8th batch!   2.5 gal batch  3gal boil  60 min boil  3# Extra Light DME   0.5oz CTZ (15.5AAU) @ 60  0.5oz CTZ (15.5AAU) @ 30   2oz Northern @ 10  3oz Northern @ 0   Anyway, all advice would be wonderful! Thank you!"

The fridge part is maintained at regular fridge temperature and it runs a secondary ferm chamber using antifreeze from the freezer.  I haven't tried lagering temps in it yet tho.

Homebrewing,3d9rhu,snoopwire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not too familiar with how fridge/freezer combos work, but I'm assuming it's all one compressor system, ya? Would it be possible to have the fridge cycled at ale ferm temps and still have the freezer cold enough to run the glycol setup? Thinking not."
Homebrewing,3d9rhu,enslaved_robot_boy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:02 2015 UTC,It would probably be easier to lager in the fridge and ale ferment in the chamber.  If you insulated the fridge from the freezer and installed a fan connected to a temperature controller to control the fridge part you could probably do it.
Homebrewing,3d9rhu,mcvarij,3,Tue Jul 14 18:34:57 2015 UTC,Is it a side-by-side fridge?  If it is I think I saw a post here where a guy used the freezer side with a temp controller for kegs with taps in the door. A second temp controller opened an aperture to let cold air into the fridge side as the fermentation chamber.
Homebrewing,3d9rhu,guybehindawall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:37:14 2015 UTC,It has the freezer on top. I did think about making a hole between the fridge and freezer sections with the hope that it would improve the efficiency of the fridge.

Homebrewing,3d9rhu,FuzzeWuzze,2,Tue Jul 14 17:15:29 2015 UTC,Utilizing the freezer doesn't work for me since my temperature controller shuts off the fridge unless it's actively cooling.

Homebrewing,3d9rhu,sdrawkcabsemanympleh,2,Tue Jul 14 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"Do what you want OP.  It'll work.  I think the coincidence you're noticing may be that at the level where brewers are using appliances for lagering and fermenting, as opposed to ale buckets in the closets is a milestone of experience. I feel when experienced brewers are more apt to dedicate more expense to equipment.   I myself began with an emptied out full-size and turned it into a kegerator. However in my second attempt, I chose something that didn't have as much wasted space inside, and didn't take up a ton of physical space in my shop.   I initially wouldn't have dropped $200 for equipment of that nature when i was first getting into the craft. But now that I'm hooked, and advanced enough, doing things like aerating my worts, pump chilling my worts, lagering, yeast accelerating. Buying more efficient tooling is a part of the way."
Homebrewing,3d9rhu,sdrawkcabsemanympleh,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:49 2015 UTC,Friend of mine said it's doable but not recommended. Every time you open the door the coldness rolls right out therefore kicking the motor back on again to cool the inside. Whereas a freezer when you open the lid the coldness stays down and does not go anywhere.

If it is consistent, then it's done (assuming your temp hasn't dropped precipitously). Room is too warm: that would have to be pretty warm, we're talking well over the threshold for human comfort. Don't leave them in your garage in the summer. Too much corn sugar: get a scale, weigh it out, and properly add it to your bottling bucket and you'll be fine.

I fermented low... about 65F, and the balance of banana and clove is pretty good.  The fermentation was low and slow at that temp, but attenuation was about the same as similar yeasts (eg wb-06), I think.  I'm not sure if this is common, but during the second and third week after pitching there was a pretty nasty smell coming from the carboy.  A combination of rotten fruit and manure, but whatever it was got cleaned up pretty nicely after I let the temp rise to about 70... I just had to let it sit.  Overall I'm happy.

Homebrewing,3d991o,Jmacadocious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"That's too hot for most beer yeast, you're gonna have off flavors.  Is this a big deal?  Probably not to anyone who isn't a beer judge, it should still taste ok but it may have some off tastes that aren't found in a similar style beer brewed otherwise.  Sounds like you may want to consider a fermentation chamber for the future, you ideally want to keep a low 60F room temp around your beer.  I'm lucky, I have a basement that stays around 65."

Homebrewing,3db9q9,CONelson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:55:13 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, this is the second brew I've done, but my first is a date/chai methomel and it's still in the aging process for now.  To give the short of my methods, it all started with a 5 gallon food-grade bucket that I decided to liberate from my place of employment.  This bucket was filled with five pounds of steamed sushi rice and a total of 10 Chinese yeast balls, it was covered in cheesecloth and the lid was firmly placed on top.  No airlock is necessary on account of the cheesecloth providing a thin opening for the CO2 gases to escape and since the bucket was sanitized, it's unlikely any sort of infection could take hold, especially with the drink being as potent as it is.  Now, some people say that rice wine isn't right unless you use the rice that's explicitly labelled glutenous rice, some people swear by sweet thai rice.  I just went with my gut when it came to the sushi rice, the sticky kind that looks like little footballs, and it went great.  Next time, I might use a couple less yeast balls, I feel like I may have gone overboard tossing 10 of them in there, but I figured better safe than sorry and it turned out just fine. In terms of taste, it's better than I expected, having never been a fan of sake.  Luckily, this isn't exactly sake.  Kind of close, I guess.  At first, the sweetness of the drink hits you, but as it goes down it starts to leave a bit of a bitter trail, which isn't altogether a negative trait in the flavor profile.  Most of the rice wine recipes I read before I started my batch say their finished product came out around 20% and I wouldn't be surprised if mine were somewhere in that neighborhood.  Anyhow, if you dudes have any questions or whatever, I'm happy to oblige and I just want to say thanks for all the great reading material you guys provide on this subreddit.  Wassail!"

This was using WLP300 which is a Hefeweizen yeast and should be fairly active.   It makes sense, since you're likely getting everything back into suspension by constant agitation, and the fact that the scale is so small may also play a role. When I was doing 2gal batches, I had significantly less noticeable krausen than now, doing 5gal batches.  Even if your yeast isn't doing a whole lot right now, unless you boiled the damn thing, it will be fine. Yeast isn't likely going to be stressed to the point that it will get damaged unless you're either fermenting something really big for a long time, or your temperatures are way off."

Homebrewing,3d9xfu,Toasty77,6,Tue Jul 14 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"So your grain bill is 9 pounds. With a mash thickness of 1.25 qts/lb (the average) you're looking at 11.25qts for the initial mash. That's 2.8125 Gallons (for the sake of friendly numbers, let's call it 2.8 gallons).  Now, we're going to assume that you're doing a batch of 5 gallons into the fermenter. Adjust as needed.  Assuming an absorption rate of 0.13 gal/lb (again, the average) you're going to need an extra (0.13 * 9) 1.17 (calling it 1.2) gallons that you'll loose to the grain.  For a 60 minute boil, we're going to call it about 1 gallon lost (adjust as your equipment demands)  I just throw the trub and all into the fermenter, so I'm calling that 0.  Maybe some loss to whole hops? I don't really bother with that.  So batch size + boil off + grain absorption + trub loss + loss to hops = water needed for brewing  Based on my assumptions above, 5 + 1 + 1.2 + 0 + 0 = 7.2 gallons.   With this number, you mash in with our original 2.8 gallons, leaving you with 4.4 gallons of sparge water. Now, I used to base all of my batch sparging off of calculators, but now I just do it by feel, so I add water and watch my HLT's sight-glass (in 1/2 gallon measurements) to see where it stops when the mash looks right. If you're lucky, you'll get 3 washes of the grain in."
Homebrewing,3d9xfu,TheDarkHorse83,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the breakdown.  A couple more clarifications: That initial 2.8 gallons is the volume that is heated to 165 or so, and allowed to sit for an hour, yes? Sparges stirred and settled for 15 mins, never more than 170F on the sparge.  Looks like different people use different grain absorption estimations, so I guess the moral of the story is to be liberal in available sparge water.  Thanks again."
Homebrewing,3d9xfu,TheDarkHorse83,2,Tue Jul 14 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"The 2.8 sits for an hour (or however long your recipe calls for).

If you denatured the enzymes, it wouldn't matter what temp you were at.   Am I sitting on unconverted wort?   It's hard to tell from here, especially when we don't really know what the actual mash temp was at which point in time. A good clue to having unconverted starches is taste, smell, and appearance. While wort can be pretty cloudy, starchy wort has a different look to it, and you can see the difference if you look at the mash water at the top of the tun when you start your mash, and then again 45-60 minutes into a good mash. Or you could have done an iodine test.   At this point, the best test is OG (did you hit your OG?) because starch will not affect SG readings enough to read on your hydrometer as a non-dissolved solid, and current SG (if the SG is decreasing, you have at least some sugar in there), as /u/everdayisbrewday asks."

Homebrewing,3d9evi,zVulture,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:06:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, so setup like a normal BIAB session.  Use your bag like a trash bag, hang it on the top lip of your pot and make sure there is a gap between the grain bag and the pot's base, this avoids scorching concerns.  Alternately you can lift the bag up using a wench during the heating portions but that's a bit more involved.  Basically all you need to do then is heat your water to strike temp, add the grain and then follow your Decoction schedule.  Each time you need a decoction just pull it from the pot, generally I hear up to 40% of your mash can be pulled out so it depends on the flavors you want (remember tannins extract at high temps so less is ok).  I use a tiny sauce pan to do this and pour it into another pot to be heated on my kitchen stove.  This decoction gets boiled up like it sounds before being re-added to the main mash.  If you don't hit your target temp that's A-OK just strike up your heat source below the BIAB and get it up to the temp you need, again be careful of letting the bag get too far down.  Repeat for double or triple decoction as needed.  Generally through my experience, decoction seems not worth the risk of adding tannins to your beer.  You can perform the same thing using direct fire BIAB alone to do Step-Mash without drawing out Tannins.  Sure you might be shorter on malliard reactions but you can get that in an extended boil and/or using Munich, Aromatic or Melanoidin malts."
Homebrewing,3d9evi,ablobychetta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:38:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. This was a special case because of the constraints. I'd just add some roasted malts instead next time.  Thanks for the pointers and clarification!

Almost all dried cherries (definitely the ones from Trader Joes) are coated in some sort of oil which is not something you want in your beer. If you would rather use the fresh ones for pie, then I would suggest a cherry concentrate or canned cherry puree over the dried cherries."
Homebrewing,3d9lyv,whyisalltherumgone_,2,Wed Jul 15 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"To piggyback off of this thread, I've currently got a wheat beer in secondary fermentation with some fresh cherry puree. I've tried to do some reading on how long I should keep the batch going in secondary, and I was thinking about 1 week. I've read that any longer and you can start to lose out on some of the fruit flavour.  Furthermore, should I stir up the fermenter once or twice during secondary fermentation? I added the fruit 2 days ago, and it took off almost like primary for a day, and now it's settled back down with all the cherry puree at the bottom of the fermenter. Any feedback from those who have done a similar brew?"
Homebrewing,3d9lyv,Freak705,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:31 2015 UTC,"I think you would get a significant difference in flavor.  Dried cherries have had heat applied directly to them, while a low amount it is enough to impact the flavor.  The fresh michigan cherries would have a fresher flavor.  I would take a pretty simple beer and make the cherries the star, low hops, light malts.  When I was living in Michigan I always wanted to make a Belgain Triple with Michigan sour cherries but never got around to it.   As I am typing this I also wanted to bring up that it will be very hard to verify the cherries are free of wild yeast w/o heat.  Maybe a soak or rince with Starsan would work.   I once read/listened to the dude from New Glarius describe his method for making is fruitted lambics but I don't recall exactly where (BYO, Zymergy or Basic Brewing Radio)."
Homebrewing,3d9lyv,freemasen,3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"Instead of soaking with Starsan, it's typically (from what I've read) better to pasteurize or give the cherries a camden tablet bath. I do a camden tablet when I make hard cider with added fruits and have had very good luck!"

Homebrewing,3d978h,parke241,3,Tue Jul 14 14:10:32 2015 UTC,"If you brew lagers, then Marzen (formerly called Oktoberfest in the BJCP style guidelines) is another great malty beer that also lines up seasonally. American Dark Lager is another lager that might fit the bill.  If you land on Scottish Ale, and you use Scottish Ale yeast at lower temps, you'll naturally get a very malty ale with some residual sweetness (or perception of sweetness). One thing you can do to enhance the toffee-type notes is to take 1/5 of your concentrated wort, and boil it down in a side pot to about a 1/3 of its volume (e.g., you might boil 1/2 gallon down to 1/6 gallon), and then add it back at the end of the boil. If you do this, it's best to steep your grains on the side, and only ad the steeping liquid to the main kettle after you've pulled off the wort you are going to boil down. Be careful not to scorch the wort!  Really other amber ales would work, too. American Amber can have a significant caramel note, and Irish Reds are another amber ale that do a good job of balancing caramel aroma with hops.  BTW, here is Northern Brewer's Brewing Calendar."
Homebrewing,3d978h,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:36:00 2015 UTC,Reducing wort is interesting. I actually just read about it in Brewing Classic styles before I read your comment. Can you really tell the difference?
Homebrewing,3d978h,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"I've never done it intentionally for flavor, although I've done it for color before (making DIY porterine, which is a much more extreme version).  I've had it in others' homebrewed beers, though and I feel like I could tell the difference. The toffee (almost butterscotch) flavor seemed pronounced. In fact the BJCP guidelines suggests it can be mistaken for diacetyl by some judges.  I'm actually going to do my first one this week, so we'll see how that works out."
Homebrewing,3d978h,psyberneo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"I brewed a porter using this method.  Read about it in ""radical brewing by Randy mosher"".  Basically by reducing the beer to syrup you're getting malliard reactions that create a toffee flavor."
Homebrewing,3d978h,psyberneo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:58:41 2015 UTC,This may be the play. I'm not sure which style to go with though. Jamil's recipe for an 80 schilling Scottish uses this method so I think I may follow that. He certainly knows better than I do haha

Things like hops and roasted malts become less prominent and other flavors within the beer become apparent.

Whatever setup you go with, I would recommend trying to accommodate a little fan inside.  It really helps even out the air temperature readings with two carboys during peak fermentation.  I really enjoyed building mine and love to talk nerd about putting it together so the following is probably way to much info.  You have been warned:  If you are considering a heating element (which you should for the winter), I have been really happy with this..  The 7 cu ft danby freezer makes lagering and cold crashing a breeze.  Solid state relays switched on/off by a Raspberry Pi control heating and cooling.  The 40 amp relays are over kill.  One temp sensor for reading air temp and one for beer temp.  This combination works out great for controlling the beer temp during peak fermentation, cold crashing, and diacetyl rest.  I wrote the program which controls the whole system.  It dynamically figures out how to move the air temp to achieve the set beer temp.  Accuracy is configurable down to .01 degree (what the sensors realistically read), has built in safeties to protect the compressor/hardware, a command server so you can log into the fridge from any internet connection to adjust all the settings, and emails me if it has some kind of problem.  Software engineer here so this stuff is really peeks my interest.  The code is open source on github and I'm happy to help anyone who has questions."

Lactose is an unfermantable sugar so it will add both body and sweetness to the beer (I like to add a pound per 5 gallons for my milk stouts) and the oats add a silky mouthfeel (about 1/2 pound for 5 gallons).   The other important thing will be adding a vanilla bean or two (scraped out, chopped up, and soaked in a little vodka) after fermentation has died down. Vanilla helps with the chocolate flavor and adds an impression of sweetness. If you haven't already added chocolate, you can roast some cocoa nibs and soak them in the vodka as well. Soaking the vanilla or cocoa nibs in vodka extracts the flavor better and makes it a tincture (make sure to add the liquid as well). To avoid going overboard with flavor, it helps to take a measured sample of the beer after it's finished fermenting and drop measured amounts of the cocoa/vanilla tincture while tasting until you get it right. Then scale that ratio up, add the tincture, and keg/bottle."

Homebrewing,3d8yvz,rayfound,2,Tue Jul 14 13:44:20 2015 UTC,Pale ale malt is actually really great.
Homebrewing,3d8yvz,chino_brews,2,Tue Jul 14 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"No, this is not right.  2-Row is simply any barley of the 2-row variety. Barley also comes in 6-row varieties. It is sometimes used as shorthand for ""American Pale Malt"" (see below), so if you see simple ""2-Row"" in a recipe, go for American, 2-Row Pale Malt.  Pale Malt simply means a variety of very light kilned base malt, but not as light as Pilsen (aka or Pilsner or Pilsener) Malt. It is usually kilned to 1.8-2.1°Lovibond. Pale Malt comes in 2-Row and 6-Row varieties. When you see ""6-Row"" in a recipe, they mean American, 6-Row Pale Malt.  Pale ALE Malt is a another variety of kilned base malt that is kilned slightly darker than Pale Malt, and this extra kilning gives it more bready flavors. American Pale Ale malt is usually kilned to 3-4°Lovibond. Pale Ale Malt theoretically could come in 2-Row and 6-Row varieties, but I've only seen it in a 2-Row variety. English Pale Malts tend to be kilned darker, and often uses a single, characterful barley variety, so this adds both a greater level of breadiness, toastiness, and/or nuttiness, as well as the character of the single barley. Examples of this are Maris Otter, Golden Promis, Pearl, etc. Each of those names are a variety of barley, and may be malted by different maltsters, such as Crisp, Warminster, etc.  There is an American Pale Ale Malt that is kilned closer to English pale ale malts, by the way: Great Western's ""Northwest Pale Ale Malt""."
Homebrewing,3d8yvz,MrKrinkle151,3,Tue Jul 14 14:13:37 2015 UTC,"2 Row is a type of grain, but if a grain's name is labeled as ""2 row"", then it is the same as what other brands are selling as ""pale malt""  Rahr doesn't even call any of their products ""pale malt."" They only sell ""standard 2 row"" and ""pale ale malt.""   here it is on their distributor's website"
Homebrewing,3d8yvz,toomanybeersies,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"True, but ""2-Row"" in this context is generally short for 2-row pale malt, or the regular base malt that North American maltsters offer (usually a blend). A recipe will usually specify Pale Ale malt, Pilsener, or a specific 2-row variety over regular US ""2-row"", if that's the case."
Homebrewing,3d8yvz,TheRealFender,2,Tue Jul 14 16:19:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Pilsner or Pale Ale malt specialty malts.  I use more Pilsner than any other malt personally. And also, pale malt like in the USA doesn't really exist outside of America.  I've never used plain old 2 row pale malt, since you can't find it in NZ, but it seems sort of shitty. You may as well shell out a bit more and get some nice Weyermann or other quality malt. Weyermann Pale Ale is meant to be very good, and I'm considering buying a sack myself.  2 row is just so boring compared to other malts. I guess it shows something about traditionally hop focused American brewing, versus the malt focused European brewing."
Homebrewing,3d8yvz,MrKrinkle151,2,Tue Jul 14 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"I used the word specialty incorrectly, they are still base malts. There are plenty of less hop focused beers here, but almost all the malty flavors will come from smaller amounts of darker grains that are added to the 2 row."

Homebrewing,3d8yvz,Oginme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"From my experience in sampling a variety of base malts:  2-row = pale malt: a very lightly kilned malt to preserve the diastatic power, produces a very mild grainy flavor on its own, good base malt for most American styles where the specialty malts will provide the majority of the malt flavors.  Pale Ale Malt:  kilned slightly deeper in color.  The result is a malt flavor that gets a little more 'toasty'.  The more color, the stronger this flavor gets.  English Pale Ale malt goes a little further and starts to give some biscuit-like flavors.  Pilsner Malt:  A very lightly kilned malt for, duh, pilsner and other Continental styles of lagers.  The malt produces a sweeter, more grainy flavor than straight 2-row."

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,TurtleBumpkins,3,Mon Jul 13 13:06:10 2015 UTC,I am also interested in seeing more experiments with olive oil as a nutrient supplier. I believe it was New Belgium Brewing that funded some inconclusive research on oil providing sufficient sterols for reproduction. Maybe it was conclusive and I just missed the results?  I know it would be a lot easier as a home brewer to drop a couple tbs oil instead of Aerating.

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,TheGremlyn,3,Tue Jul 14 05:43:17 2015 UTC,"We should add evaluating cold-pitching starters into the mix. I've been doing it for years with [allegedly] excellent results. The theory behind cold-pitching is that the yeast don't start eating into their nutrient stores as they warm up. Whether a few hours warming up really makes the yeast eat up enough stored nutrients will make a difference in unknown, but cold pitching a starter is very convenient. The only aeration I do is the splashing of the wort into the fermenting vessel, and I don't have very long lag time before seeing activity."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,TheGremlyn,2,Mon Jul 13 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"I've done a pitch temp xBmt, is that what you're referring to?"
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,hedgecore77,3,Mon Jul 13 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"No, cold-pitching refers to the temp of the starter. Many bring the starter out to warm up to the same temp at the wort it will be pitched into, but I leave the starter in the fridge until I need it, then decant and pitch while the yeast is cool. Apparently it is a commercial beer practice.  Some reference:   http://www.maltosefalcons.com/tech/cold-pitching-yeast http://www.danstaryeast.com/articles/pitching-temperature-and-nutrients http://www.brewboard.com/index.php?showtopic=26969   It's recommended mostly for harvested yeast, but I find it works well with starters too. I noticed reduced lag times, anecdotaly, when I started doing it. I doubt it produces better beer or even different beer than warming the starter up prior to pitching, but it's easier for me to pitch whenever I want and not worry about warming things up first, especially if I get lazy and let time finish cooling my wort overnight or something."

You can then compare what flavor differences you get when you only aerate with 02 vs when you pitch more yeast with an aerated starter. I always do both but I've been thinking that really I only need one or the other."

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,NowhereAtAll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"It is also very important to keep in mind that there will be a generational difference. You may not notice a difference between the two batches now because the yeast is healthy and will make good beer for both batches. But if you are to repitch the yeast after fermentation, the one from the batch that is aerated will be much healthier and will have more stored nutrients for the next batch. You will notice a difference after a few repitches.  I was having that problem early on with reusing yeast. After about 4-10 generations, I noticed that the yeast gave up before hitting the FG. This is with shaking the carboy to oxygenate. I bought and read Yeast: the practical Guide to beer fermentation and that changed what I thought I knew about yeast.  Aerating by shaking doesn't actually give it enough oxygen for many situations. The yeast quality these days from the distributers are so good that it can compensate for much of it. It just becomes apparent after several uses. I oxygenate everything now. Starters I keep constant aeration via stirbar. Wort, I aerate early on (before the first 12 hours). Meads, I aerate and add nutrients several times early on (every 12 hours for first 24 hours (so 3 times)) because OG is so high I need the yeast to multiply a bit more then required for beers.   One of the co-authors is Chris White. That last name sounds familiar? Yes, that is the same White as in White Labs! And he was dropping some knowledge bombs. I highly highly recommend reading that to anyone who has not. That book is one book in a 4 part series (one for each of the core elements in brewing: water, yeast, hops, and grain).

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,hungrycaterpillar,4,Mon Jul 13 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"I think there's some misinterpretation of what the impacts of lack of O2 are.  Yeast make booze just fine without O2.  However, their cells walls might suffer for lack of lipids which would degrade their overall health, lead to petite mutants, stress fermentations, etc, etc, over time as that yeast is reused.  I don't think that brewer was giving you bad information, just a little incomplete.  If you are in a position where you want to reuse yeast for as long as possible without effecting the quality of the product, making sure they have plenty of lipids is probably in your best interest.  I, personally, don't think that any one specific batch demands the use of O2 lest it turn into a dumper.  That variable, isolated, might lead to problems when combined with something else, or perhaps the beer could be a little cleaner with added O2.  But I also think there's plenty of value in making your yeast happy and healthy.  Most of us are process limited to some degree.  Figuring out what we can do well is as important as understanding what out limitations are."

However, in the context of /u/rayfounds's XMBT on no-aeration vs. pure O2 in a 1.069 IPA, it gets interesting.

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,NowhereAtAll,2,Tue Jul 14 11:28:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know... a yeast that is prone to esterification when fermented anaerobically would make a good test under the circumstances. Maybe I am misunderstanding the methodology here, but it seems to me that the test is looking for the degree of difference between aerated and not, rather than specifically for off flavors.  If there is any real difference, a Belgian should show it.  After that, you could work back to varieties that would have less pronounced differences."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,NowhereAtAll,2,Tue Jul 14 14:54:04 2015 UTC,you're right. I assumed that test should provide proof that other methods are worse that pure oxygen because they may cause off-flavor casued by lack of oxygen.

It splashes a ton, and even on 1.1og beers we never had any problems with fermentation. This is with a starter ofcourse.

No, there is no need to aerate the wort but it does not harm the yeast either. During its aerobic production, dry yeast accumulates sufficient amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and sterols to produce enough biomass in the first stage of fermentation. The only reason to aerate the wort when using wet yeast is to provide the yeast with oxygen so that it can produce sterols and unsaturated fatty acids which are important parts of the cell membrane and therefore essential for biomass production.  If the slurry from dry yeast fermentation is re-pitched from one batch of beer to another, the wort has to be aerated as with any liquid yeast.""  Danstar FAQ  ""Lallemand packs the maximum amount of lipids into the cell wall that is possible during the aerobic production of the yeast at the factory. When you inoculate this yeast into a starter or into the mash, the yeast can double about three time before it runs out of lipids and the growth will stop....When you produce 3-5% alcohol beer this is no problem...You definitely need added O2 when you reuse the yeast for the next inoculum.""

I looked up what fermentis says (since I used us-05) and they seem to recommend adding oxygen, although there really isn't much explanation:  ""Oxygen is required to assure a healthy cell multiplication. Oxygenation is either made by top filling and splashing wort against the wall of the fermenter, aeration or direct oxygen injection. It is usually recommended to make the oxygenation on cooled wort. At this stage hygiene is essential since bacteria may develop during the aeration. Oxygen should only be added in the first twelve hours of fermentation (9 ppm). Adding oxygen during late fermentation will increase aldehyde levels and amplify diacetyl formation. High levels of oxygen will suppress ester production. It has been noticed that oxygen can increase SO² concentrations in some worts.

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,brothermalcolm1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to make a claim on whether or not the results would be different with liquid yeast.

I'm not convinced that it would make a detectable difference, but I've never done the legwork to back up that claim.  I think the takeaway here is that experiments only make claims based on what they are designed to test.  Greg tested O2+dry yeast in a moderate gravity wort, which as Marshall pointed out, isn't an uncommon brewing practice, even if the manufacturer says it's not necessary.  They didn't find any difference.   We might be interested in other experiments along these lines, but that's for other experiments."

Water contains ~240 micromolar oxygen when fully saturated (at atmospheric pressure), which is an extremely low concentration that can be achieved with only minor air to water contact. 90 seconds of shaking is plenty of time.

""I would hypothesize if the wort is in fact well shaken and/ or assertively racked (per the above comment) you could reach near saturation anyway – which is often stated as being around 8-12 ppm depending on source – which could limit the potential differences. That is fine, and a data point of its own. I cannot really state for sure, without looking up references, whether or not yeast benefit from having 12 ppm (from a good ol’ shake) vs 15-20 ppm, temporarily forced into solution, by pure O2 and a sinter stone.  There are also benefits to not having to shake: less stress on the body if you are not fit enough or have health issues, don’t want to risk injury, are using glass fermenters, can make a mess, takes longer, potential for inconsistency, you’re lazy….you’re holding a beer…"""

But, I think we're trying to solve a problem from we don't have. Commercial brewers have HUGE vats with high volumes and low surface area, so low oxygen penatration, but us home brewers have small volumes and high surface areas, so I think it is essentially a non-issue for us."

Nobody is measuring dO2 (for very practical reasons).    dO2 in wort is less than that of water and there a lot of factors that effect how much dO2 you get into the wort (temperature and atmospheric pressure being the big 2). Source    Maybe I'm missing something but if the solubility limit of O2 in wort is about 7-8 ppm (at most pitching temps), then in an open system (carboy/bucket with airlock) you cannot possibly get more dissolved O2 than that. It will come out of solution basically immediately and go up and out the airlock.    I'd really appreciate if someone with more knowledge on this could spell it out for me (chemistry isn't my strongest). Mentally, I just can't get around this.

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,SHv2,3,Tue Jul 14 03:05:52 2015 UTC,Contributor Greg compared pure O2 to shake aeration in a split batch of the same wort!
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,thefost310,9,Mon Jul 13 12:53:24 2015 UTC,"I responded in a comment off the main subject, but there's a fairly large design flaw in this experiment.  O2 provides lipids.  Dry yeast is packaged with enough lipids for a 3-5% ABV ferementation without any additional O2 whatsoever.   That said, I still don't think result would be all that different."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,afr0,2,Mon Jul 13 13:14:29 2015 UTC,Why is it that O2 provides lipids?
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,UnsungSavior16,2,Mon Jul 13 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"Because of the Crabtree effect yeast never respire (use O2 directly to reproduce) in wort.  They switch over to anaerobic reproduction (which we prefer because it produces alcohol).  All worts contain enough glucose to inhibit the aerobic reproduction pathway of yeast.  In the anaerobic pathway, O2 is absorbed and processed into lipids (fatty proteins) that maintain the health and flexibility of the cell wall.  This is important because it keeps the membranes elastic as the cells divide and ensures good yeast health across the entirety of fermentation."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,skunk_funk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"Where in the anaerobic pathway does this happen? As I understand it, during anaerobic respiration, yeast take pyruvate (end-product of glycolysis), convert it into acetaldehyde, which they then turn into ethanol (in order to generate NAD+, which is needed for continued glycolysis). I find it curious that O2 would be an important step in the anaerobic pathway (which, by definition, uses electron acceptors other than oxygen), and glancing over my notes on this, I can't find any mention of it. My notes are definitely not exhaustive though, so I'm not calling bullshit or anything.      Also, just to be pedantic, lipids aren't proteins."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,hallslys,2,Mon Jul 13 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"That's the thing.  It's not explicitly part of the pathway to generate ATP anerobically.  It's since O2 uptake on the aerobic path is suppressed, the yeast uptake the O2 and synthesize it into lipids (sorry, I meant to type fatty acids/sterols/not proteins).  These lipids are used to maintain cell wall health during fermentation.  O2 is the most common method that brewers use to ensure adequate lipids to see the yeast through the complete fermentation.  There has been some work into alternative methods to supply lipids.  That's why the blanket homebrewer statement that you need add O2/aerate at pitching is misleading.  A more complete statement would be something to the effect that, yeast need lipids in some form to be as healthy as the can be."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,skunk_funk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting. It stands to reason that O2 must be relevant to yeast health in some way since aeration is generally deemed necessary (and as you pointed out, it's not for aerobic respiration). Don't suppose you happen to have a reference or something on the O2 -> lipids -> cell wall health process? I realise most people don't carry bibliographies on this stuff, so no worries if you don't."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,ConvertsToMetric,3,Mon Jul 13 15:58:14 2015 UTC,"It's covered in detail in the book Yeast by White, but there are also other sources floating around online.  Morebeer has a notated article on it"
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,gnisna,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's a great read. It does say though that the lipids are essential for the cell membrane, and not the cell wall (as the cell wall is mostly made up of carbohydrates). This makes sense (in hindsight), given that the cell membrane is pretty much made up of lipids (e.g. lipid bilayer)."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,lbcsax,2,Mon Jul 13 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's a ""huge design flaw,"" as many home- and pro brewers use O2 with dry yeast, so there's some value there. But like you, I'm not convinced it'd have made a difference with liquid yeast either, though it's definitely deserving of being tested!"
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,lbcsax,9,Mon Jul 13 13:16:45 2015 UTC,"""Huge design flaw"" wasn't meant to imply that O2+dry yeast is going to make bad beer or anything.  Just that if the point of the experiment was to test the effect of Oxygenation vs Shaking the fermentor for aeration, the manufacturer itself states there isn't going to be any difference, because (a) the yeast already have enough lipids for the fermentation of this OG and (b) they will scavenge the O2 added anyway.  It's providing some confirmation that shaking/O2 isn't going to produce different results for low OG dry-yeast fermentation, which is nice.  But it's not really not testing a claim that the manufacturer makes anyway.  *edit: was -> wasn't.  Also, I'm not sure why your being downvoted.  Your statement that dry+O2 is a fairly common practice isn't incorrect.  I think we just both have different end-points to make."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,jimmysask,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"I appreciate all the feedback! My point is that we'd want to test this anyhow and will get to other stuff later.  Downvote?

Homebrewing,3d4e6p,jimmysask,3,Mon Jul 13 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't figure you cared about the downvote itself, it's just that sometimes information that gives context to the original post gets buried and can cloud some the discussion.  That kind of bothers me...occasionally anyway.  You and the rest of the writers are always pretty upfront on what your testing and the extent of the claims you make based on those are.  I just didn't see anything about dry yeast and the difference in how it's packaged regarding lipid content than liquid/reused yeast in the write up and wanted to bring it to your attention.  I agree there's value in the experiment as plenty of people place a very high value on pure O2 in their process, and I'm not entirely sure of their claims in all situations."
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,fescen9,2,Mon Jul 13 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that context gets buried, nature of the beast I suppose. I really appreciate your feedback!"
Homebrewing,3d4e6p,GrizzlyBearKolsch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:54:57 2015 UTC,So it looks like it should make more difference in high OG worts due to the built in lipids etc already with the dry yeast. Still good to see an experiment to essentially help confirm this.

Homebrewing,3d6pwa,danNYtrack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:50:57 2015 UTC,Timing the beer right to keep 3 taps pouring is a bit of an art.  I find it's much easier when I double brew every other brew day.  That way I have the fermenter freezer open to cold crash and carb kegs before they go in the kegerator.  So when I keg pops I just grab the next keg.

The tower is another problem, but I'm getting the most foam from the bubbles forming at the end of the hose where it meets the keg.

Sodastreams at least are available in most supermarkets.  Sadly, I dropped mine and broke the gauge on it but with a little guesswork, it's good for a mobile dispense option, especially since I have a 13lb cylinder that's a pain to haul without a safety stand."

Homebrewing,3d8vls,rouest,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:20:59 2015 UTC,I can understand pulling it after active fermentation was done but think you might have lost a significant portion of your yeast population (depending on the type of yeast) and slowed your ferment. What kind of conical is it?

Homebrewing,3d8vls,brock_lee,4,Tue Jul 14 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"Two things:   I believe that your beer is probably fine, once the yeast has established a nice healthy environment they have an overwhelming advantage over any other microbes that might get into your fermenting beer.  Usually if there is going to be an infection, it is one that already exists in the fermenter (i.e. the conical wasn't cleaned properly) or is gets access to the wort before the yeast has lowered the pH and started producing alcohol.   On the homebrew scale, there is no need to remove trub/yeast cake from the fermenter.  Doing so simply increases the likelihood of accidental infections."

Homebrewing,3d7i2e,TheGremlyn,2,Tue Jul 14 12:38:18 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that bulk aging will cause the beer to mature/age a little faster than in bottles. If you're talking about either of the beers you mentioned above, I wouldn't have an issue with either of those being more bottle conditioned than secondaried. There might be a slight flavor variance, but the longer the beer is in the bottles the more mature it will taste, so just give it some extra time."

This RIS or Brunch could even stay in the primary for that length of time no problem. In terms of bottle over fermenter conditioning, I'm going with the fermenter as the yeast is still healthy and in larger numbers to clean up phenols and other possible off flavors over time. When put in bottle form, you've changed the environment of that yeast and (depending on yeast strain) could stall your conditioning. Either way, if you have the time, both methods are fine."

I might try mixing Cascade and Centennial/Amarillo for the late additions to the boil, moving the 5 min to a whirlpool at 180° for 20 mins, and dry hop with Amarillo/Centennial.  If you want a bigger nose on it, check your water profile. If I recall correctly, sulfate accentuates hop aroma."
Homebrewing,3d7pgk,sevenzig,2,Tue Jul 14 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"I forgot to add... I'm going for an all cascade because I can get cascade for $12 a pound. So I thought I would give it a shot because I like a good citrus flavored hop variety. I'm beginning to think my expectations are getting shattered by my love for citra, amarillo taste.  I was trying to keep op simple and left that info out.  edit: Also, my 0min becomes 212 to 70 because of immersion chiller."
Homebrewing,3d7pgk,sevenzig,2,Tue Jul 14 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. While Cascade is a great hop, IMO it's citrus character pales in comparison to many other varieties (Citra for sure)."

Homebrewing,3d7pgk,Seabrew,2,Tue Jul 14 04:53:20 2015 UTC,"If you're getting Cascade for cheap, use it and supplement your additions with another hop. ex: Make those 2 oz. additions into 1.5 Cascade and .5 Citra/Centennial/Amarillo/[hop of choice]. For the dry hop, I'd probably go closer to 1:1."
Homebrewing,3d7pgk,Averydryguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"Well to be blunt, I was looking for a way to utilize the cascade by itself, and now I'm reaping the results.

I'm going to make this beer again slightly different for parties.  I appreciate the advice, but at this point my experience says stick with citra with a little amarillo for that cirtus punch with a slight catty smell. Spend the money on the hops (which I don't mind) for that hoppy beer.  I never really experimented with cascade by itself and I am a little dissapointed."
Homebrewing,3d7pgk,ConvertsToMetric,2,Tue Jul 14 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"I would just forgo the 15 and 5 min hops, settling on 6-8 oz of Cascade at 0 min, then do a ""hop stand"" by letting the hot wort and hops sit there for 1-2 hours. It will increase the flavor and aroma extracted from the hops while also getting some bittering.   Cascade aren't the most citrusy out there, but you can make some damn good beers with it!"

Homebrewing,3d5m6r,Livingthedream_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:58:46 2015 UTC,"The wording isn't entirely clear, but it sounds like they added wine grapes to the beer: ""We took our Black Tuesday Imperial Stout and fermented it along with late harvest Syrah grapes from the vineyards of Los Olivos, from our good friends at both Fess Parker and Saarloos & Sons.

Homebrewing,3d5m6r,oldsock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:52 2015 UTC,Would they add whole grapes or just the must? Either way the beer is amazing. I went to Sarloos and Sons last time I was in California. Great winery. They had a few cases of the batch they did in their cellar. Another question while I have your attention...I just brewed my first sour using Modern Times Oud Bruin recipe from Beersmith. Was that one you wrote?
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,Livingthedream_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:08:55 2015 UTC,"Either would work (I believe they've done both for other beers), I can't remember if the shot with the whole grapes from the Bruery made it into the book? Fermenting on the skins provides additional character (for better or worse) to wines, I'd imagine beers would be similar.  It was, but I don't think it was ever actually brewed... Empty Hats is actually the red recipe that is on there. They thought it was too dark, so they tweaked the brown recipe to lighten it up and it became the red."
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,oldsock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe I will do that recipe next. My buddy was giving me shit because the IBU on the Oud came out to 21. That's well within range according to Beersmith, but I was wondering how that will effect how the beer sours."
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,Livingthedream_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"You'll still get IBUs from a hop stand. They won't be as significant as they would at 60, but you'll still get them. More aroma than anything else though."
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,Thatguyaric,2,Mon Jul 13 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"Any temperature below boiling will have reduced AA isomerization, so contribution is lower - and at 185 (the temp I whirlpool mine) it's almost none.  And anyway, if the OP wants some small amount of bittering, but does not want aroma/flavor additions, then he should add them during the bittering phase of the boil (especially since that will give the most accurate IBU contribution calculation)  e:   More aroma than anything else though.   Yes.  This is why I suggested an early addition of a neutral hop, since OP's wife specifically does not want hop flavor or aroma.  Not to mention that an early addition will provide ""cheaper"" IBUs, because you'll need very little of an inexpensive high-AA hop."
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,3Vyf7nm4,3,Mon Jul 13 23:00:31 2015 UTC,Another alternative is to use the concentrated grape must from a wine kit in the primary fermentation.  Use a 1 gallon kit in a 5 gallon batch and treat like a brewing sugar.
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,rcaller,2,Mon Jul 13 19:10:49 2015 UTC,That's what I did w/ my Flanders Red. I added about 1 gallon of red wine concentrated grape must to 4 gallons of partially fermented beer. Ended up w/ about 60% of sugars from barley and about 40% from grape juice. Came out awesome. I'd recommend OP mash a little bit high for a Saison to help compensate for a thin body from all the simple sugars
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,TheRealFender,2,Mon Jul 13 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"in my experience a little bit of Nelson Sauvin goes a LONG way.  I used 1oz at flameout in a 4G batch (it was the only hop addition) and it was so pungent it was undrinkable for weeks.

Homebrewing,3d5m6r,chapusin,2,Mon Jul 13 21:34:56 2015 UTC,"It's hard to find, but a relatively new hop named Hallertau Blanc gives off white wine-like aromas: sweet floral and pear according to my notes. A local New Mexico brewery had a small batch pilsner featuring this hop and I just had to use it alongside saison yeast. I dry hopped a 5 gallon saison with 1 oz. and it is wonderful (my recipe). I used White Labs WLP566 though, so definitely more yeast character than 3711, and it's probably the interplay more than just the hops alone. Be sure to ramp your temps as high as you can in the later stages of fermentation to get the most out of your yeast.  If you make a strong saison, maybe along the alcohol levels of a tripel, the presence of alcohol taste could make it more wine-like as well.  Regarding bitterness, about 10 IBUs is all you need for one of these. That's pretty common for hefeweizens, wits, and American wheats. Perhaps a little unconventional for a saison, but if that's what she wants then who cares about convention. Good luck!"
Homebrewing,3d5m6r,recovering_engineer,2,Mon Jul 13 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"The information on the beer is widely available. The hops are Amarillo for 20 IBU. The beer is fermented with both an ale yeast and Brett Brux. The former barrelman/brewer, John Laffler, is quoted as saying both that it was a blend of a 100% Brett fermentation and a Sacch-fermeted beer, and also contradicts that by saying that the beer was fermented and then put in white wine barrels with orange peels (but he also says they hand zest it, so I suspect it's just orange zest) and Brett B. The oak is clearly part of the flavor (vanilla notes), but there's no need you can add wine later as oldsock suggests. It's easy to propagate the yeast from the dregs, and you could do that if you want.  I'd add Amarillo at 60 for 18-20 IBU, and then dry hop with Amarillo. The bittering is clearly there, and your wife likes the beer."

I may give that a try next time.  Boiling them separately could also be an option though I've read that hops need some sugar in solution to help with isomerization, but I've not seen any science to back that up."

Homebrewing,3d485h,geebr,3,Mon Jul 13 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"I knew it could take a while, but I wasn't too sure I had aerated enough. Typical beginner nerves, though, because it's bubbling away now.   Congrats on yours. I hope it comes out good. I'm already eyeing my next recipe. :)"
Homebrewing,3d485h,MarshmallowBlue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"Just had this conversation with another person on the subreddit, and thought I'd pass on the wisdom. The yeast will begin fermenting whether you aerate or not. The only real reason they won't is if you kill them (e.g. high temperature). In a glucose-rich environment (such as wort), the yeast will prefer fermentation over aerobic respiration and will instead use the oxygen to synthesise lipids. The lipids are used to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane and so the oxygen is conducive to overall yeast health rather than the fermentation process. I think you might run into issues with incomplete fermentation by under-aerating, but I wouldn't really worry about it. The yeast can get lipids from the grain and hops so they'll be just fine.      Oh, and I also made my first homebrew yesterday! Woke up to it bubbling just like you. Happy days."
Homebrewing,3d485h,Fevers_and_Mirrors,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. I'm feeling much less concerned now, both because of what you mentioned and also from the number of people who've said they don't aerate at all aside from siphoning the wort to the fermenter. I poured the wort (1 gal batch) to the fermenter so I guess that's enough aeration all by itself.   So much to learn! :)"

Homebrewing,3d49dy,DeadNerd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:28:35 2015 UTC,What is the best way to maintain a certain temperature while boiling your wort or mash?
Homebrewing,3d49dy,TheReverend5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:43:46 2015 UTC,"Well...when boiling your wort, you're going to maintain the boiling point of your wort automatically. It won't go higher than 212F, so just crank it up as high as you want (and keep track of your boil off).    With a mash, that's a bit trickier. A lot of people use coolers like igloo coolers where they pour their heated strike water from a hot liquor tank, and then pour their grains into that strike water (or some similar iteration). Once they've combined their grains and strike water, hopefully they've hit their target mash temp, and they seal that bitch up and wait the 60 minute mash time. I do stovetop BIAB, so I'm fucking with my stove knobs and getting frustrated with the pain in the ass that is initially acquiring stable mash temps with an electric stove. I used to do stovetop BIAB with my dad on a gas stove, where we would heat our water in a kettle to strike temperature, add grains, adjust mash temp as needed with direct heat (or stirring, to lose heat), and then we would wrap the kettle up with reflectix + blankets.    And that's not even close to all the options for maintaining mash temps. So there's a lot of ways to maintain mash temp, lol."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,DeadNerd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:53:33 2015 UTC,So direct flame is better than stovetop because it controls the heat more efficiently. Looks like I'm going to buy myself a gas burner! Thanks!

Homebrewing,3d49dy,DeadNerd,2,Tue Jul 14 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"If you make your own recipes, how do you know what each malt and hop tastes like? In cooking food, I know what each ingredient tastes like because I can just taste it. But can you tell by tasting beer ingredients how it will affect the taste of your beer?   I might not be asking this the right way, since I've only been brewing for two weeks."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,MisterMillennia,2,Tue Jul 14 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"The optimal way to determine what different base malts and hops bring to the table is by doing SMASH (Single Malt And Single Hop) brews to get yourself a feel for their aromas and flavours and any specific characteristics they bring (ie IBUs, etc.).  To learn what the grains with little enzymatic activity do (stuff like crystal and carafa, where you can't get much fermentable sugar out of them, if any at all) is to add them to a SMASH or light on flavour/aroma beer that you have already made and know the characteristics of. This helps you determine what is different between them.  For hops specifically, you can add a couple of pellets/a cone to any cheap light beer like Tooheys or 4X (Or Coors or Budweiser or whatever is the most flavourless thing you can get), recap, and chuck in the fridge for a little while. This will tell you the flavours that these hops add when Dry-Hopped, and allow you to formulate proper beer recipes based around them.   Other than this, looking online can help you to determine what they taste similar to, and base your recipes off of that (e.g. Munich is a base malt, so it would taste close to a base malt like Pale Malt, but with the additional information that it is nuttier and grainier). This way isn't the best for learning what they taste like, but can be helpful to tell you what you should expect from them. I personally wouldn't use this to build the recipe off of, but it can be useful for theorycrafting purposes.  EDIT: I have an allergic reaction to malt, so I can't comment on whether you can tell what flavours they add by eating them before brewing. Sorry if this was not what you were actually asking."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,DeadNerd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:47:46 2015 UTC,That's awesome that you can add them to plain beer like Coors to see how it affects the flavor. That's a great tip!! Thanks!
Homebrewing,3d49dy,TheReverend5,2,Tue Jul 14 12:09:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good question, imo. There's two really good ways.   Of course, the first way (and arguably best way) is to try various recipes that are good examples of a style and observe how the various recipes obtain their different flavors through grains, hops, and yeast. A great resource for doing this is buying the book Brewing Classic Styles and brewing recipes for styles you like out of that book.    Another good way is to taste and smell each of your ingredients. Taste each of the malts you use in a recipe. Smell each of the different types of hops after you open a package. Make yeast starters for your liquid yeast and pour off a little of the starter beer to taste. Each of these methods can give insight into the flavor contribution of the ingredients. I will say that starter beer is usually not very tasty though - nonetheless, I do believe it can give you information regarding what a particular strain of yeast contributes to beer fermentation."

Homebrewing,3d49dy,bluelinebrewing,2,Tue Jul 14 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"Pump question:  I recently threaded a street elbow into my kettle to act as a makeshift dip tube.  As soon as I did, I started noticing problems pumping from the kettle -- difficult to prime, cavitating, etc.  I ended up taking out the dip tube and it stopped.  Is there some way that the dip tube would make it pull in air?"
Homebrewing,3d49dy,Rollercoaster671,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:27:50 2015 UTC,"Like KlueBat said, each pump has an minimum NPSH (net positive suction head) which is how much pressure is on the inlet of the pump. If there is a restriction in the line before the pump, the pressure will drop since the pump is pulling the liquid upstream. If this pressure drops below the NPSH, the liquid will boil and the vapor pocket will collapse basically on the impeller (or right after it). This does catastrophic damage to large scale pumps, but can damage small pumps if it is sustained for a long period of time.  I'd suggest lowering the pump so it has a few feet of liquid pushing down on it (head). The more head the better, although it might not be able to push it back up."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,KlueBat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:11 2015 UTC,"If you have pictures of the install that would certainly help.  Otherwise, I'd suggest checking your connections for leaks would be a good start.   If there are no leaks then it might be, as you suggested, cavitation. Cavitation is the liquid boiling due to a sudden drop in pressure. See this Wiki Article."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,bluelinebrewing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:07 2015 UTC,"No picture, but I can describe the setup.  It's a Chugger pump, inline, with the inlet facing down and the outlet facing up.  Outlet goes to a tee with a valve to the right that I use to prime, and a valve facing up that I use as the outlet.  The pump is on top of an 8"" x 8"" x 8"" cinder block, with the inlet hardware hanging off the front, almost at the ground.  The kettle is on a Bayou Classic SP10 (~12-14"" high?) that's also on cinderblocks, so the kettle valve is probably ~20-24"" off the ground.  I use 4' hoses with camlocks.  There's an elbow on the kettle side, but a ""Big C"" female camlock on the pump inlet side.  Maybe the elbow just took away enough head pressure that it was sucking in air?  I was getting air bubbles in the hose trying to prime it, so 100% gravity feed, no suction from the pump."

Homebrewing,3d49dy,chirodiesel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"I had this exact same problem when I first got a pump. When I didn't have a whirlpool arm attached to the 1/2"" welded NPT coupler at the bottom of my kettle I never had the pump cavitate when kicking on the pump for the last 15 minutes of the boil. As soon as I attached this my pump started to cavitate like crazy. It turns out that because it was so close to the base of the kettle and pointed down that it was drawing in a lot of bubbles during the boil. Before going electric, we had to point the whirlpool arm up before filling the boil kettle with wort and then push it down manually when racking to keep your problem from happening. It was ghetto, but it worked. Easing off on the pump valve helps too. It was far more likely to draw in more bubbles the more open it was."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,chirodiesel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"Also, while boiling the oxygen nucleation points make bubbles and will introduce oxygen causing it to cavitate. Turn down the valve on the pump to prevent this if you are whirpooling."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:24 2015 UTC,"Cavitation:       Cavitation is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid – i.e. small liquid-cavitation-free zones (""bubbles"" or ""voids"") – that are the consequence of cavitational forces acting upon the cavitational liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure that cause the formation of cavities where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense shockwave.  Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some engineering contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause cyclic stress through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called ""cavitation"". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.  Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of mantis shrimps and pistol shrimps, as well as in the vascular tissues of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in control valves, pumps, propellers and impellers.    Image i - Cavitating propeller model in a water tunnel experiment.

Homebrewing,3d49dy,thomscottson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:31:03 2015 UTC,It is two different measurements taken from two different measurement systems. Plato comes from using a refractometer and Specific Gravity comes from using a hydrometer.

I've had good luck letting wort sit in a kettle for 24 hours if I start by heating it to 185 and let it cool naturally with the lid on.

Homebrewing,3d49dy,vinpaysdoc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:11 2015 UTC,Using a priming sugar calculator is your best bet.   The highest temperature that your beer reached after fermentation was finished is helpful to determine how much residual CO2 is left in the beer when making calculations for additions of priming sugar.

Homebrewing,3d49dy,HotCarls,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, when bottling at a cooler temp, you are supposed to use less sugar as there should be more CO2 remaining in the beer than if it was warm. The thing is, if your beer had been finished fermenting several days before you cold crash, there might not be any difference between a 40 degree bottling and a 70 degree bottling (Someone please correct me on this if I am wrong)  You might be pushing the limit here for possible bottle bombs. That is going to be putting your bottles at around 3.8   Just take all your bottles and put them in a bucket and cover it up. If it were me I would probably cautiously approach them after about a week and try opening 1 to see if it is extremely carbed. If it isn't, I would let it go another week and do the same. If it is, you can either refrigerate them to stop the carbonating and pray they dont blow up, or you can crack the cap on one at a time to let some CO2 out."

As explained above, it's not the temperature of the beer at the time of bottling that makes the difference. It is the highest temperature of the beer AFTER FERMENTATION WAS COMPLETE. Why? Because more CO2 escapes the beer at higher temperatures. The calculators ask the temperature so they can adjust for the highest temperature and calculate the amount of additional CO2 needed based on that temperature."

I don't have much experience with over priming and I'm assuming that most situations have unique factors that change conditioning time.   What type of beer is this? Another factor is if you were shooting for an IPA (around 2.4 or 2.5 vols) then you overshot by a metric shit ton.

You don't completely crack open the cap, but you just gently press with an opener and you can let it hiss out a bit. You repeat that a few times (if it's super carbed it will keep filling up that empty space and then releasing), then reseal with the capper."

Homebrewing,3d49dy,bluelinebrewing,8,Mon Jul 13 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"Growlers aren't made to hold the pressure necessary to bottle condition.  If you're lucky, the bottom seam will break and you'll just lose all your beer.  If you're unlucky, you're fitting yourself for an eyepatch."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,rrenaud,2,Mon Jul 13 18:33:39 2015 UTC,Why is there more pressure during the bottle fermentation than after it finishes?
Homebrewing,3d49dy,TheReverend5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"Because after a beer finishes fermenting, there is no longer CO2 being actively generated and released from the beer. When you add priming sugar and referment in a bottle, CO2 is being generated and released again, thus creating pressures that growlers are (generally) not rated for. I have a really thick-glass 36 fl oz growler that is pretty much an oversized swing top bottle that I use for conditioning, but I haven't done anything above 2.7 vols in it."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,rrenaud,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand.  Are you saying that growler fills are less carbonated than bottle conditioned beers?  The amount of fermentation is monotonic with time.  Presumably volume is proportional to the amount of fermentation, and pressure is proportional to volume.  Is there sometime of maximum pressure before the bottle fermentation finishes?  Why, when?"
Homebrewing,3d49dy,pricelessbrew,2,Tue Jul 14 05:29:21 2015 UTC,"Growler fills are already carbonated.  Flat beer becomes carbonated during bottle conditioning,  but before the beer becomes carbonated the headspace filled  with more pressure due to differences in c02 production vs time,  c02 dissolution vs time in the beer and equalization of the pressure in solution and in the headspace.    Example with random numbers: beer is carbonated to 12 psi,  maximum psi held in bottle during conditioning 25,  bottle can withstand up to 33 psi,  growler can withstand 20 psi.  So bottling in a growler risks giant bottle bombs ccapabale of cutting your throat open."

Homebrewing,3d49dy,chino_brews,2,Tue Jul 14 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"3 gallons as a HLT seems small.   You need to run about 7.25 gallons of hot water through the system to yield 6 gallons of pre-boil wort after grain absorbtion loss on a 10-lb. grain bill (about a 1.046-1.054 beer), and if you can limit system loss, evaporation, trub loss to 1 gallon, then you'd end up with 5 gallons of wort in the fermentor.   Realistically, you probably need about 8 gallons of hot water, which implies a 5-gallon HLT. But...  You could definitely work around this if you did a batch sparge and juggled things a little. Like heat strike and sparge water in the 8 gallon, run the first 2.5 gallons of wort into the 3-gallon and start it boiling, add the sparge water to the MLT, empty the 8-gallon of water while the mash settles, then transfer the second runnings into the 8-gallon, and finally pour the rest of the wort from the 3-gallon into the 8-gallon, and move the 8-gallon onto the burner. So the 3-gallon would just be a holding tank."

Chilled my wort to 60F, aerated it with O2 tank, decanted the liquid from the starter, swirled and pitched. Set the STC-1000+ to my Kolsch profile and waited.  That was Friday.

It was basically some kind of malt/hop syrup that you added water to and then pitched the yeast in. I chose an IPA so I'd assume it would be a top-fermenting beer, however it seems like all the yeast have flocculated(?) to the bottom. The airlock is still bubbling albeit quite slowly. Have I done something wrong or is it normal to get a layer of (what I assume is) yeast on the bottom? There's some caking on the sides so it looks like it has fermented quite violently at the top.

Extract you're best off using distilled or tap with low mineral amounts.  The extract itself has the ions it needs for a good flavor profile, so you could be overloading by using tap water.  However - good tasting water often makes good tasting beer.  I have found that the tap water at my home is suitable for extract brewing, not perfect, but just fine. All grain gives you the latitude to tune your water more, as the ions/minerals all come from your water.

Homebrewing,3d49dy,colonpal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"Both have potential possibilities.  I'm thinking that maybe if some of that hop character dies off it could make it better.  We pulled a sample and added some honey to it and it was far better.    Maybe I'll send it to a judge and see if they can give some feedback on it.

Homebrewing,3d49dy,Jmbct,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:46:34 2015 UTC,Thanks  I assume that's boil right?  I was thinking of trying to double hop an IPA on my next run and throw in some citrus flavor.
Homebrewing,3d49dy,andrewprime1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at flame out is when I'd add. The tincture thing is probably the best way to dial in the perfect amount of flavor.

Homebrewing,3d49dy,money_house,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:37:17 2015 UTC,Help me understand the relationship between temperature and gravity readings. It seems most equipment is configured to operate at ~68°. What happens to the reading if it's colder or warmer than this? If it's colder will the reading show lower or higher than the actual value?
Homebrewing,3d49dy,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:07:46 2015 UTC,"From how I understand temperature and gravity readings is that the higher the temp, the lower the SG.  This is due to the fact that higher temps mean things are moving around in the liquid at a molecular level due to higher energy, so the hydrometer will sink a bit more.  When the temp is lower, it's the opposite since there isn't much movement at the molecular level, so the hydrometer won't float as easily giving a higher SG reading."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,money_house,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"I think I'm picking up what you're saying, but the hydrometer is sinking in your both your examples. Basically, when the temp is higher there's more molecular movement in the liquid causing the hydrometer to sink. The opposite happens when the liquid is cooler causing the hydrometer to float higher.   If this is the case my last batch of beer is gonna be pretty weak :("
Homebrewing,3d49dy,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the hydrometer will still sink in both instances, but what changes is how much it sinks.  The higher the temp, the easier to sink, the lower SG will be (ie, SG is supposed to be 1.052, but instead will read 1.048).  The lower the temp, the more difficult to sink and will float more resulting in a higher SG (ie, SG is supposed to be 1.052, but instead reads 1.060)."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,danhauk,2,Mon Jul 13 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"If the temperature is higher than the calibration temp, the reading will be lower than it actually is (i.e. it reads 1.054 when it's actually 1.060).   My hydrometer came with a table to calculate temperature offset - e.g. add 2 points if the temperature is 80F, add 3 points if the temperature is 83F, etc. (these are just examples, not actual values). But there are also a number of online calculators such as the one on Brewers Friend that will do it for you."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,KFBass,2,Mon Jul 13 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"If it's colder, the reading will be higher so you have to subtract from what you read. Or just read them all at the right temp. I usually cool my sample in some room temp water."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,money_house,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply.    I usually cool my sample in some room temp water.   Meaning you collect the sample in a container and place that container in room temp water, right? That's a good idea.   Yesterday's brew was my first lager and, as usual, I forgot to take a OG reading until after I brought it down to temp and pitched my yeast. I was wondering how off my reading was at 62°."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,KFBass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, cool the sample in a glass of room temp water.   I work in Plato so its tough but a couple degrees celcius off is about 0.2P difference. So like 1.001 (this is all really rough math) there are temp correction charts out there.  62f is pretty high temp for a lager"
Homebrewing,3d49dy,money_house,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"Technically a lager, but it's actually a California Common. The recipe and yeast I used called to ferment at around 62°.  https://www.wyeastlab.com/com_b_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=131"

There has been active fermentation for about 16 hours now. What's a good time to add the maple syrup? Should I stagger the additions? Do I need to add yeast nutrient with each addition, or further oxygenate? I pitched a massive starter of WLP090 and oxygenated once, and when I came back in 4 hours to oxygenate again I already had a small krausen forming.

Homebrewing,3d49dy,Roscopoor,2,Mon Jul 13 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"hello! I am thinking of brewing this recipe and wanted some input * 8.5 lb Pilsner * 2.5 lb Wheat * 1 lb Honey * 1 lb Acidulated Malt * Rosemary  * 1oz amarillo @ 60 * 1 oz saaz @ 10 * 1 oz saaz at 0 yeast: recipe lists french saison but i'm not sure if i want it that dry       Would adding aromatic malt (maybe .5lbs) help with more mouth feel? Any recommendations/tips for ""sourdough saisons""?"
Homebrewing,3d49dy,rayban_yoda,6,Mon Jul 13 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"I would be cautious on how you use the acidulated malt, especially during the mash, considering it is malt treated with lactic acid. The common theme I read/hear is ""For every 1% of the grain bill it reduces mash pH by 0.1."" You are around 7-8% (.7-.8 points on pH scale) this may make your mash too acidic and prevent proper conversion. (This is a major approximation considering differences in buffer effects and water source)  You could add most of the acidulated malt towards the end of your mash (last 15-10mins) you provide some conversion from the acidulated malt but leave most of the malt untampered with during the mash.  Modern fully modified malts usually hit around proper pH just fine on there own (5.2-5.4)  Having said that I also have read, from Weyermann's website, that ~8% is the proper amount to use for lactic ""twang.""  Best of luck!"
Homebrewing,3d49dy,KFBass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:22:17 2015 UTC,"The mash ph will depend heavily on the water chemistry. I've done 15% acid malt and had a mash ph of 5.2.  8% for most people will give a light twang, brighten things up a little bit."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,rayban_yoda,2,Mon Jul 13 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"Hence why I said I would be cautious, I also mentioned buffering effects and water chemistry.   It is not an easy answer without viewing OP's  water analysis. I would be cautious. I typically can't add more than 3-4% in the mash or my wort becomes too acidic. I add the rest of the acidulated malt later in the mash."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,sufferingcubsfan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Two and a half pounds of wheat is going to give plenty of mouthfeel.  I can't help on the sourdough saison, I have no clue what you are shooting for, there."

Homebrewing,3d49dy,sufferingcubsfan,0,Mon Jul 13 16:07:33 2015 UTC,Rosemary in a beer?  To each their own!
Homebrewing,3d49dy,Roscopoor,2,Mon Jul 13 16:14:12 2015 UTC,It is kind of different but I've enjoyed it in IPA's quite a few times so with the right balance i think it could blend nicely in a saison

Method was inoculation with lacto from grain husks (because my White Labs lacto starter failed) incubated for a few days, then pitching S-04 and Brett Brux Trois. I nice pellicle has developed, but I'm getting a little more acetic acid in the aroma and flavor than I think is normal.  I presume this could just be heterofermentative lacto creating acetic acid, but I guess it could also be acetobacter. Is it likely to go away and mellow over time (assuming its not acetobacter)? I was planning on this being a quick sour, but I figure the Brett might do some magic over time so I'm willing to let it sit if it means saving the batch."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,KidMoxie,5,Mon Jul 13 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"Did you boil post souring? If not you probably have acetobacter. If that's true it won't go away, you'll just get more vinegar.  Also, why do you think your lacto starter failed? A pure lacto strain shouldn't create a krausen and may not even produce CO2, so it won't look like a ""regular"" starter."

I tried to keep it warm (in the range that's recommended the promote lacto growth and stifle acetobacter), but I might not have succeeded. Is there any way to discern acetobacter growth? Does the pellicle have any characteristics? I know this pellicle looks a little lumpier, almost like cottage cheese, whereas previous brett pellicles I've seen have had a more whispy, spider silk like appearance.  The starter failed because I accidentally picked the wrong shipping option with the yeast, and it sat 40C heats during transit. I made a starter which I incubated, but it failed to acidify as far as I could tell. I pitched it anyway, but I'm pretty sure it was dead."

I do have two separate fridges that can each hold 3 kegs. How do I deal with this? Carb them warm (after a cold crash), then refrigerate? Will the carb rate change as it was chilled? Carb them 2 at a time in the separate fridges?"
Homebrewing,3d49dy,Mayor_of_tittycity,2,Mon Jul 13 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"You can carb them warm. Refer to this calculator. Carbing Pressure Calculator. I'm not sure how long it will take. Same as the set it and forget it method so probably 3 weeks? The amount of CO2 dissolved in your beer, ex 2.2 vol, will stay at 2.2 vol, but you have to make sure to adjust your regulator pressure down once you cool it. You'll also probably want to purge the head space a tiny bit and hit it with whatever the appropriate pressure is once you cool it down, that way you have appropriate headspace pressure."

Just don't add granules unless you want a beer volcano -- make it into a simple syrup by boiling it in water.  I'm not sure this is really an issue, but I like the idea of allowing the yeast to ferment complex sugars first, and then giving them the simple sugars, in hopes that this will reduce chances of a stuck ferment.

I have been struggling with what to anticipate in terms of attenuation. You often read of people saying they hit 90% while the Wyeast guide lines say 77-83% so it makes it harder to know what to expect.   My current target is lower that yours at 1.060 including sugar, so without it's 1.051 meaning i'm using less malt. I have estimated 85% attenuation so this way I leave myself a margin of error if it under or over ferments. I don't want a 10 % saison and I want it be dry so trying to balance both as best I can for a first saison until I have a little more experience."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,AdamTheMechE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:29:17 2015 UTC,"15 minutes before the end of the boil is pretty standard.  You could theorycraft all day about whether adding it at the beginning would change hop utilization, but it's a saison so no need."
Homebrewing,3d49dy,jakl53,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:36:36 2015 UTC,What do you mean by thinning out your beer? Are you wanting a lighter beer? Adding sugar will raise your OG which will also raise the alcohol content. Either way people typically add sugar into the end of the boil.

Homebrewing,3d4z6a,why___,3,Mon Jul 13 18:28:18 2015 UTC,The three yeasts are the same strain. I believe I cultured from 1056 though.

Homebrewing,3d4z6a,testingapril,2,Mon Jul 13 18:34:57 2015 UTC,"Right, Sorry.  I didn't bother actually reading the three strains, I just saw that there were three.  I typically use US05 for my IPAs and I stopped reading after I saw that strain."
Homebrewing,3d4z6a,sufferingcubsfan,2,Mon Jul 13 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"This is correct. I believe I used Wyeast 1056, but the three are identical as far I know (aside from any liquid vs dry yeast differences w/ us-05)."

I want to test my theory that proteins in suspension/trub at the bottom of primary grab up some of the hop aroma from dry hopping."

Homebrewing,3d6eyy,Barleynbaccy,3,Mon Jul 13 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"I'm in collection mode right now, because I've finally got a decent pipeline going.  Firstly, as others have said, get people to return your empties. Just make sure they rinse them, otherwise you get gunk in the bottom that's hard to shift.  I'm a student at university, and my brother was involving in running one of the clubs there. One time when they were having a barbecue, (with their permission) I stood next to the bottle recycling bin and saved all of the bottles in a couple of large plastic garbage bags. I think a netted ~140 bottles that way."

Homebrewing,3d6eyy,KanpaiWashi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"For me, when I give away some beers, I tell them just keep the bottles after use and give it to me next time they see me or I'll come pick it up.  I also ask family and friends that whenever they drink bottles of beer (I personally request amber bottles that have no designs on the glass itself), to just wash them after use and hold onto them and I'll come get them myself.  Also, if you know anyone that throws parties, ask them to save their beer bottles.  I had a friend who had a housewarming party and I asked him if I could have the empty bottles at the end of the night and I ended up leaving with nearly 4 dozen.    I've also heard that you can ask bars for their empties.  It didn't work for me as most of the bars I called are on some kind of recycling plan with a local recycling company, but I've heard for others this has worked."

Homebrewing,3d4tdo,BrewingandDrinking,4,Mon Jul 13 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"The tank should have a tare weight printed on the side.  Weigh the tank and subtract the tare weight to give you the co2 left.  A common thing I have heard is about 1 keg per pound of co2 if force carbonating.  Obviously just a rough guideline, but fairly accurate in my experience.  If you have a dual gauge regulator, once the needle starts to fall, that means the tank is almost completely empty.  Think of that gauge as more of a ""fuel light"" in a car, rather than an accurate gauge.  Until you are almost out, the gauge probably won't move very much"

Homebrewing,3d4tdo,GrizzlyBearKolsch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"My co2 regulator has two gauges - one for tank pressure, and one for serving / keg pressure.   I have the same size tank as you, and it rarely needs filling. It lasts quite a while.  Look into a dual gauge reg.. It will save all they guess work and save you running out half way through a keg (or worst, right before you carb!)"
Homebrewing,3d4tdo,Sl4clist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:20:37 2015 UTC,Both of mine say there perfectly fine until about theyre 1/4 keg away from empty. I hate that.
Homebrewing,3d4tdo,hypergolic,2,Mon Jul 13 16:24:52 2015 UTC,The dual gauge doesn't work well because most of the co2 is liquid. The gauge will say full until the tank is nearly empty then all of a sudden the gauge will read empty.
Homebrewing,3d4tdo,dpatrickv,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:47:39 2015 UTC,I got about a year out of my last 20lb tank. I would guess there was 20 kegs that went through that during that time. Maybe more.

Homebrewing,3d6i2a,testingapril,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Probably the chilling portion of the party. Air will be sucked in by the contracting of the air and liquid as cooling occurs and this can suck in some dust with microbes on it.  You should consider getting a no-chill cube and doing the no chill technique where you fill the cube while it's still boiling then seal it and let it cool, then transfer to another container to ferment."

Homebrewing,3d6i2a,oldsock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:15:13 2015 UTC,"It's not likely. Lacto is about the only non yeast that will produce co2 and it can't do it in great enough quantity to produce a krausen. Also, most lacto produce a protease that destroys foam forming proteins, so that makes it even less likely.  He's probably got a wild sacch, Brett, or dekkera going in there."
Homebrewing,3d6i2a,testingapril,2,Mon Jul 13 23:47:17 2015 UTC,Are you speaking from experience or theoretically? I've gotten krausens from Lactobacillus (for example).
Homebrewing,3d6i2a,oldsock,2,Tue Jul 14 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, I suppose.  I've gotten krausens from what was supposedly a 100% lacto ferment (specifically WLP677), but all the latest research and info coming from biologists and experts over at Milk the Funk is indicating that lacto by itself will not produce a krausen or ferment more than a few points of gravity, so any ferment showing those signs is most likely contaminated with Sacch.  White Labs lists WLP677 as Lacto Delbruckii, which is actually an Obligatory homofermentative species. So it shouldn't produce CO2 at all, much less enough to form a krausen. Speculation is rampant as to why WLP677 in particular seems to have a problem with full on fermentation."
Homebrewing,3d6i2a,testingapril,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"I even got a krausen from a pure culture of Lacto that Matt Humbard (active on MTF) gave me a couple years ago. Not as impressive, but still a krausen (very light and airy like soap suds)."
Homebrewing,3d6i2a,chino_brews,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe ask him about it? He's listed as one of the folks who reviewed that particular section of the MtF wiki for accuracy.  Also, I find the info on Omega lacto a bit curious, I've got a starter of it right now that is very obviously producing CO2. It's in a mason jar and bulging the lid with the lid screwed down tight. I wasn't using aseptic technique, so it's possible it became contaminated, but it's not producing CO2 like Sacch does, that's for sure, and there's no krausen. I need to take a pH and gravity reading and see what it has done. I don't understand how the provider of that culture needs to do more research to see if it produces any CO2. It's a pretty simple test it would seem."

One thing you can always do is a few days before your event you can jumper the beer out of one keg and into a fresh one, hopefully leaving most of the settle sediment behind in the first keg.  edit 2: If you do decide on a Cream Ale, don't call it a cream ale. Most people think it has actual cream in it if you call it that. Just call it a Light Beer or something."

Homebrewing,3d5ecx,mirthilous,2,Mon Jul 13 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"Well I brought my whole kegerator with me so I don't know if my setup would translate for you. I'd bring CO2 for sure but for just for a single night of serving you don't need to worry about beer line-length too much. You aren't going to under or overcarb your beer over a single night so just get it pouring good with no foam with whatever length of line is convenient to use.  For the hops, plenty of easy substitutes for Crystal, especially with such a lowly hopped beer like this. Hallertau or Mt. Hood could sub in easily and I bet the LHBS has one of those in stock."

Light lagers are going to be by far the most difficult on your list there. Making a beer that clean and that delicate is not something I'd throw at a beginner personally, but if you wanna do it go nuts. Gotta learn by doing at any rate.  Wheats generally do well at higher fermentation temperatures because you want the yeast profile. Stouts or anything roasty will cover up flaws, so are generally great for beginners.   Which styles would /r/homebrewing recommend for beginners on a non-professional DIY setup?   Most homebrewing setups are DIY at least to some extent. I think we'd all suggest making what you like to drink, and working on it until you've got it dialed in."

Homebrewing,3d5jjb,geebr,2,Mon Jul 13 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"Lagers are actually a fairly recent invention. Lagers need to ferment at a relatively low temperature, and before refrigeration this was really hard to do. You could really only make lager during the winter or if you had access to a cave or basement that kept a steady cool temperature. Also, as /u/Fenix159 points out, getting really clear beer can be challenging from a technical perspective."
Homebrewing,3d5jjb,Fenix159,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd call lagers a recent invention. Wikipedia isn't always the most reliable source, but in this case I feel it's sufficient enough.  While perhaps not as old as ales, ""fairly recent"" seems quite the exaggeration to me.

At any rate, neither is actually particularly recent. Both are far easier to control more recently, but the processes themselves can't really be said to be recent.  Understood and developed better recently absolutely."

To use a cooking analogy, brewing is like making soup -- you use different ingredients for different kinds of soup, but the process is basically the same.  Lagers require more attention during fermentation.  To make a nice clean lager, you need a lot of healthy, happy yeast, and you need to be able to precisely control fermentation temperature around 50F."

Homebrewing,3d5jjb,ar_604,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"If you like saisons, it's an excellent way to start, especially if you're in the northern hemisphere this time of year. It's an incredibly flexible and forgiving style at almost every step of the way.  The base malt is easy: any blend of barley and wheat malt/extract and a few ounces of whatever specialty grain you think might be interesting. You only need 1-2 ounces of whatever hops you happen to like or think might be cool, split them half at the beginning of the boil and the other at the end while you chill. if you're all-grain, the temp isn't critical (you have more leeway in mash temp than most styles would allow), and saison yeast will chug along just fine about any temperature that humans find comfortable, so just stick it somewhere dark that stays more or less the same temperature for a couple of weeks (bathtubs are good)."
Homebrewing,3d5jjb,ar_604,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"As others have told you, a great many of us have varying degrees of DIY setups.  Here is my ""fancy"" gear.  Pretty much any wort - ale or lager - is going to be similar to produce, with the biggest difference being in how often you add hops.  Ales are easier to ferment, though, as you can keep them in the happy ~65-~70 degrees F mark without special equipment of any kind... maybe, at the most, a robbermaid tote full of water, your fermentor inside that, swap out ice bottles to keep the temps down.  Lagers, though, ferment cooler - usually more like ~45-~55 degrees F, meaning that you probably have to get a temperature controller with a mini fridge, chest freezer, etc.  You can do it with a cooler and ice bottles, but it's tough."

Homebrewing,3d5xw4,KodamaNuki,6,Mon Jul 13 19:55:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe pick another gift. Besides the fact that aging a beer in a barrel is an intermediate thing that adds unneeded complexity for a new brewer, the problem is that small barrels have a gigantic surface to volume ratio, compared to ""pro"" 50 or 55-gallon barrels, and this leads to complications like overextraction of oak flavor, and rapid oxidation of beer through the porous wood. Most homebrewer ""oak"" their beer by putting pre-toasted cubes of oak in the beer that's aging in a glass or plastic fermentor."
Homebrewing,3d5xw4,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"Amen.  Too much contact with the wood, and you'll get a woody flavor to it.  For some bourbons and whiskeys that can be a good thing, but I can't see it tasting great for most beers."
Homebrewing,3d5xw4,colonpal,2,Tue Jul 14 07:01:34 2015 UTC,"They are fairly small if you weren't aware, but you can definitely use them more than once.   You should be able to sanitize them well with boiling water and sulfates/Campden tablets.   I don't see anything about ""toast"" levels for the barrels, so flavors might vary and the oak flavor might be a little harsh. Since they are small they impart flavor fairly fast. Also if you try to age them for an extended amount of time you will lose volume through evaporation- learned this the hard way. You might want to top them off as time goes on.   These are a little on the pricey side and would probably make your first brew a little more difficult than just using oak chips/cubes/spirals."

Homebrewing,3d6h0n,Biny,2,Tue Jul 14 00:52:22 2015 UTC,"The yeast is actually on the outside; the inner pack is just nutrients -- I did have a smack pack come partially inflated from NB (due to summer shipping) and this is what they sent me:  The Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast packs do have a tendency to inflate during shipping. The inflation is due to residual co2 left over from propagation being released from solution during shipping and not usually from being activated. Most likely the yeast is still viable and should be alright to use. If the nutrient pack is still intact inside you should be able to activate it as usual and the pack should inflate the rest of the way.  A trick to activating slightly swollen packs is to turn it upside down so the nutrient pack is in the narrowest part and open the gussets on the bottom. Then squeeze the package with both hand in the middle forcing the co2 into the expanded area and then move your fingers downward feeling for the nutrient pack. Once you have isolated the pack in one of the corners you should be able to place it in the palm of one hand and smack it with the other.  If you were planning on making a yeast starter that will also work as a viability check for the yeast and will improve the overall health.

Make sure your starter is room temperature (bring it down with an ice bath) pitch your yeast slurry and place a piece of tinfoil over the opening. This is optimal to kick off (whats left) the yeast slurry. If you have a stir-plate put it on that for 12 hours or not, then make sure to agitate regularly to allow for O2 to help propagate the yeast.  After 12-20 hours, look for some activity (a mini krausen, or small layer a the base of the flask) and place in the fridge to cold crash it for another 12 hrs.   This time you should see a little layer at the bottom of the flask and you can safely decant everything except for the little bit of liquid and the beige layer at the bottom. Now do a 1 quart water to 1 cup of DME starter (the same way as the first) and do the same thing...cold crash and decant over and over and over. Every time you do this, you should be smelling the yeast and making sure there isn't a off smell like garbage or cabbage etc. Should be a nice pleasant beer aroma. You can even taste it if it smells fine. Each time you do one of these your increasing the cultures.  Storage  After you feel you've done enough growing. Boil a few mason jars and lids in water for 30 mins and collect the boiling water (with proper gloves/protection) and put on the counter to cool. You'll hear the lids go pop, now they can go in the fridge to cool.   Once they've cooled down. Decant the water in the mason jar and add the whole starter, making sure to fill it up as high as you can get it to insure oxygen doesn't have a place. If you need to leave some of the boiled sanitized water in the mason jar to reach your highest possible volume then that would give you a nice clean environment for your yeast to be stored. Close and keep in the fridge up to 3 months. Remember this is highly susceptible small culture of yeast and it needs to grow to healthy numbers before you start making 5g batches with it. I would suggest doing another starter and making a small 1 gallon batch then washing the yeast like you did with the mason jars. Also, remember to keep your working space very sanitized.  If you want more information on washing, this /u/brulosopher post on washing yeast is great."

I hate to say it but I already know how to step up starters.In any case you are extremely helpful. and if this works out I'd be more than willing to send you some of what I'm calling Amish Yeast."
Homebrewing,3d77s2,CarlsbergCuddles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:58:57 2015 UTC,"No problem, that's what Reddit is about. I would suggest to maybe try one of your later starters to maybe include honey. I'm guessing the Amish likely use honey in that GB recipe and the yeast are accustom to breaking down that sugar.   I would take up your yeast offer, but my country has extremely difficult quarantine laws."
Homebrewing,3d77s2,darthKOTOR,3,Tue Jul 14 06:30:56 2015 UTC,"You can always just ask for a sample of their yeast. I am sure they would be more than happy to give you a tiny bit. It very well might be bread yeast, so expect bad beer... However, It could also be a cool proprietary strain to experiment with. You will have to try it to find out. As always : follow up with us."

Homebrewing,3d4ko2,bridges12791,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do:   Clean the keg (warm water plus OxiClean Free or PBW). Push some through the tap to clean the dip-tube, line, and faucet. Rinse the keg (warm water). Sanitize the keg (cool water and Star-San). Push some through the tap to sanitize the dip-tube, line, and faucet. Purge the keg: attach the lid, pressurize with CO2 and vent. Repeat. Rack the beer into the keg. Attach the lid and purge the head space three times. Leave the keg cold and attached to gas at your desired pressure for two weeks. Once the beer is cold you can rock it back and forth for a few minutes to speed up with process. Dump the first pint or so to get rid of any yeast/hops/trub, then enjoy!"
Homebrewing,3d4ko2,oldsock,2,Mon Jul 13 14:13:15 2015 UTC,"Could you expand on the Purging step?   i.e. why do this to an empty keg, and why repeat this?"
Homebrewing,3d4ko2,oldsock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:38:54 2015 UTC,Air is bad for beer. CO2 is not bad for beer. By purging before and after filling you reduce the potential for oxidation.
Homebrewing,3d4ko2,Scottishstalion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:56:17 2015 UTC,"As r/oldsock says, it's to ensure that there's a layer of CO2 in your keg while you siphon your beer from your carboy into your keg. This way the beer never touches oxygen as there will be a layer of CO2 on top of your carboy and layer inside the keg."
Homebrewing,3d4ko2,VeggieAstronomer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"To clarify a bit more on the other two answers, CO2 is heavier than air. So if you pressurize with CO2 then release (using the pressure relief valve on the lid of your keg), you're letting the air out while the CO2 sits on the bottom. Then you have some more space, you fill it with more CO2, and repeat. It takes a couple of times doing this to fill the keg completely with CO2 instead of CO2 and air."
Homebrewing,3d4ko2,parc,2,Mon Jul 13 22:06:44 2015 UTC,"Just a random thought: I purge the keg by attaching my co2 to the beer post, closing the lid and pulling the relief valve, then running gas into it. You don't really even need a lot of gas. I then rack back in through the beer post, leaving the lid on and the valve open. Since the co2 will sit at the bottom of the keg, the rising beer will evacuate the remaining air.  Bonus: I only have to sterilize the inside of my autosiphon. I can do that when I siphon the sanitizer out of the keg.  Edit: autocorrect"

You probably have a good idea of what you need to do but it helped me to watch someone else do it.  To me, the most important part is making sure you get a good seal by applying keg lube to the o-ring and pressurizing the keg enough to seat the lid. A spray bottle of Starsan solution will help you find any slow leaks -- it sucks to have to replace your CO2 because it all leaked out over a couple days."

Homebrewing,3d49dz,SHv2,2,Mon Jul 13 12:45:35 2015 UTC,Chocolate Strawberry Port... Details please!  You make wine like I make mead. All sounds delicious too.
Homebrewing,3d49dz,TheDarkHorse83,2,Mon Jul 13 12:56:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay, I had to get my hands on my wine jounal.  (Thank you for this by the way, I needed to finally type it up.) I'll first provide you with my old method, then I'll tell you what I'm changing this year and why.  Chocolate Strawberry Port 1 Gallon  5 lbs Fresh Strawberries 2 1/2 lbs Sugar 1 tsp Acid Blend 1/4 tsp Tannin 2/3 Cups Cocoa Powder 1 tsp Yeast Nutrient 1/2 tsp Yeast Energizer Water to 1 Gallon 1 Crushed Campden Tablet 1/8 tsp Pectic Enzyme 1 pkg Lalvin RC-212  Clean and slice/crush strawberries (often I like to chop them in half and freeze them for a day or two to help them break up, then thaw them out before use) and add them to primary.  Dissolve sugar in boiling water, allow to cool (it can still be hot, but let it get cool enough to touch) and add to primary. Mix in all other ingredients except pectic enzyme and yeast. Let sit for 12 hours and add pectic enzyme. Let sit for another 12 hours and add yeast. Let ferment to 1.010, then rack to secondary.  Rack every 2 months for ~8 months. Raise SG to 1.030, then add Brandy (and I used a little 151Rum, too) to bring ABV to ~20-21%.  Let sit for 2 more months or until clear. Bottle in splits.  2015 Changes First, the yeast, as much as I love RC-212 I wanted to use a port specific yeast, so I ordered Wyeast 4767. However, this only has an alcohol tolerance of 14%, so I'll be pitching either RC-212 or EC-1118 to an active fermentation at about 10%, that should get me to about 18% meaning that I'll need less distilled alcohol.  Second, I'm chaptalizing this year, so I can get more out of the yeast, but it also means that I should have a wine that's aging already sweet, leaving me less to do on the back end.  Third, I'm adding distilled spirits early. With that much alcohol I have to worry less about infections, oxydation, and lees will fall out faster (as the yeast will die) so clearing it will be easier, too. Edit: I forgot to mention, in my research of Port wines and their making, I read that adding the distilled spirits onto the fruit solids aids in flavor extraction, so I am hoping to get a bit more of a strawberry kick by adding them early.  Fourth, Bentonite. I now add it to primary of every batch that I make, it clears things up so fast that I'm amazed by it. As an experiment I did two batches of the same fruit last year, the bentonite one cleared MUCH faster than it's twin. Any thoughts on Bentonite's use in beer?  Notes:  Personally, I like using something like brandy for mine. In Portugal they will add clear, unaged over-proof brandy (but it's basically grain alcohol), so why buy the good stuff? Because in Portugal they would also then turn around and age the wine in an oak barrel, and since I don't have any (yet) I decided that I'd use an alcohol that had been aged in oak to impart the flavors. Besides, at 1-3 gallons a batch, it's not overly expensive. At 10 though it would be a little outside my comfort zone and I'd have to get some grain alcohol (from the next state over) and some oak cubes."

Homebrewing,3d49dz,TheDarkHorse83,2,Mon Jul 13 18:02:16 2015 UTC,"Well, you clearly know how to do mead, and though I have never really done one myself, I would have to assume that after primary fermentation, the process is very similar. A few rackings to get it off of the lees, stabilizing, a little clarifier, maybe some back sweetening or an acid adjustment. Luckily Port is a low sulphur style, so you don't have to worry about keeping higher levels of SO2. The only difference that I can see, inexperianced as I am with mead, would be in primary and prep, but I'm sure that won't be too much of a problem, especially considering your long list of fruit infused meads."
Homebrewing,3d49dz,SHv2,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"Mead:   Number of rackings are surprisingly few. There is always a primary to secondary racking. If there is fruit or mushy stuff involved there will be one more racking just to get off that. I don't bother with stabilizers. Time is my claifier. Don't bother with back sweetening. If I want it to end sweeter I'll build the recipe to do this. Never really play with the acid too much unless I really need to.   If I don't have to deal with a lot of that other stuff, I'm in for trying to make it."

Homebrewing,3d49dz,TheDarkHorse83,2,Sat Jul 18 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"After stabilizing the wine, either dissolve sugar in a small measure of wine or in as little water as you can.   Or you could add juice concentrate."

Which lead to a round of compliments on my brews.  I enjoy brewing and drinking my own beer but I continue to brew and strive to improve for the enjoyment of sharing it with friends. To hear that they are all huge fans and even discuss it with other people really made my day."
Homebrewing,3d49dz,PoopFilledPants,2,Mon Jul 13 13:01:43 2015 UTC,"My carbonation issues with my keezer are still driving me mad. I was given a number of good ideas in this thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/3ap649/im_getting_way_too_much_head_could_i_get_some/), the consensus seeming to be that my line lengths were wrong. I've since used three different calculators and tried each configuration- 10ft, 6ft, and 2ft lines, but the beer is still coming out same as before: 90% foam but still kinda flat. My lines are 3/16"" hard polyethylene (the only type we use here in Australia and no one else has any problems with it).  I've tried adjusting my serving pressure, which had been set to 12psi according to beersmith (and other calcs), to no avail either, starting from 0 and working my way up to 20. I'm brewing mostly APAs with OG around 1050. Temp has been set to 39deg ever since setting up the keezer. I have measured inside temp with different thermometers in different points of the freezer and they're all telling me my temp controller is accurate. Still haven't tried a fan to circulate cold air, is that likely to make a difference given my consistent temps throughout the freezer?  Next step: buy a manifold? Doesn't seem like my tee valves should be a problem but I don't see many people using them, and maybe there's a reason.  I am SO frustrated...any input would be really appreciated  For reference here is my setup: http://imgur.com/a/suRnm  Edit: No detectable gas leaks, but I've never changed the o-rings on the used kegs I've got...could that be causing problems?"

Have you tried using a picnic tap or any other type of beer dispensing mechanism?  I was having trouble with a hand-me-down single tap kegerator, and it turned out to be the faucet.  I found out it was the faucet by connecting a picnic tap and it worked fine and the beer poured perfectly.    The air lines won't be the issue, changing from a tee to a manifold won't work."
Homebrewing,3d49dz,kanno,2,Mon Jul 13 14:43:38 2015 UTC,"What I Did Last Week:  Tried my second brew, a porter.  It tastes like burning.  Based on a bad assumption of fermentor size, I accidentally turned my 5.6% beer into something around double strength according to the efficiency calculators I plugged my grain bill into.  I never measured OG since I didn't have a hydrometer yet, but I know it finished at 1.030.  The calcs I did put my OG somewhere around 1.113!  According to Mr Malty, I added enough yeast for the batch size I did to handle that OG, and it definitely has tons of booze, so I'm assuming it all fermented.  Maybe some aging will help this one out, but it's pretty rough around the edges as of right now.  Bottled my Hop Monster IPA  Put in my first Dry Hops!

I don't know if it was my thing, but it was definitely higher quality than the swill I've done...  I split my Chocolate Dunkel and added cherries to half, and earlier today finally put my finings in, ahead of their entries into a competition next month. I don't expect much (other than defaulting to 1st in the ""Weird"" catagory since the Chocolate Cherry Dunkelweizen is the only one being entered), but I hope they turn out competition worthy.  I also cubed the All-Grain Mexican Cerveza I was talking about last week. When I was first pouring out of the kettle, I was terrified that I hadn't gotten any extraction since the liquid was so light, but I was pretty close to my expected efficiency (6% lower isn't bad considering it was my first attempt at crushing the grains, my spacing ended up slipping, and I had to do it by hand).  Finally, I bought a ton of stuff to try my hand at water chemistry to see what effect it will have on a beer. I'm going to be picking up the grains for two batches of Munich Helles, and comparing between adjusted water and distilled water (I'm using distilled because my water is super high in bicarbonates, and I don't know the mineral concentrations in my usual spring water). The reaction I got from my brew club when I asked them where to pick up Epsom Salt (for the Magnesium) was not good, hopefully they don't see me as a crazy bloke now.

Oh well, it tasted rad, I don't care. Australian Pale Ale Blackcurrant Cider - Didn't add any sweetener to this; I like it, and the guys at the brew club loved it, but my family does not Czech Pilsner (From early last year - I make so much better stuff now that this only gets brought out for people who expect low quality beer from Homebrewers before they get to go near my top shelf). Muscat (Unknown Variety) Grape Red Wine (Unknown Style, it's like a Merlot but not shit). Ginger Beer (Ginger beer with 50g of ginger soaked in VSOP Cognac added. Still not gingery enough for me. May have to look into artificial ginger flavourings)   In Planning:   All-Grain Munich Helles + Water Treated All-Grain Munich Helles Muntons Bock Stella Clone (pre-hopped extract kit I found that I am going to add some dry hops and grains to to get a close flavour profile) Lowenbrau Clone (same as above) Brett Trois + Galaxy Pale Ale Brett Trois in ""Kolsch"" Fruit Beer with passionfruit Rice Wine - Just to see what happens   Active Projects:  Not a bloody clue what else to do.

Homebrewing,3d68en,NSAdroid15025,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:08:55 2015 UTC,"I've always just ground the wheat and mashed like I would normal 2-Row. I do usually throw about 1# of rice hulls in the mix to help avoid a stuck sparge but I'm not sure if you need to do that with BIAB or not.  Only other thing I could really maybe critique is that is a decently big dry hop for a hoppy wheat. Not that it wouldn't be tasty but might overpower some of the wheat flavor/aroma. Not sure if you care or not, just an observation."

Homebrewing,3d68en,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:04:50 2015 UTC,"What's the OG? I think this calculates to something like 1.074 at 67% brewhouse efficiency. That seems really high, and unless that's what you're going for I'd shoot for 1.050 for an American Wheat Ale. Also, I'd get a precise handle on the IBU, and then if you target a typical 0.47 BU/GU ratio on a hoppy American Wheat, you'd target 24-25 IBU of bittering, and then hop burst (if you can chill quickly) and dry hop for high level of Cascade/Citra aroma and flavor."

The commercial beer is 6.5% abv. If you can take the FG of a degassed sample, then you'll be able to back-calculate the OG. If not, this ends up at 7.4% abv at 75% apparent degree of fermentation, so you may wish to dial the OG back a little to get closer to the original."
Homebrewing,3d467z,GrizzlyBearKolsch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:22:54 2015 UTC,I could definitely use a little more insight into fermentation profiles for Kolsch yeast. My last batch took 2 weeks to finish fermenting. Starting temp was 58F and I held it there for 5 days before allowing it to free rise up to 68F. Typically I'm cold crashing well before the end of the second week but this time it took much longer. Did I just start fermenting at too low of a temperature to begin with?
Homebrewing,3d467z,kingscorner,2,Mon Jul 13 16:20:35 2015 UTC,"ive brewed a kolsch three straight batches now and all three seem to taste the same, which is good, since they are delicious. i do not have temp control yet, but my basement is a consistent temp all year. usually my fermentation temp is right around 66F. once fermentation is finished in about 3-5 days the temp drops back down to ambient, which is about 63F. i cold crash in the fridge for two weeks then carb for another few days. just put my last kolsch in the fridge last nite after 6 days. FG was 1.004. cant wait til the end of the month!"

Homebrewing,3d467z,rph73178,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:40:29 2015 UTC,66F is around 19C. i did not raise the temp. that was the temp from natural fermentation. just the slight heat generated from the fermenting. and i used WYeast 2565 and also reused the same yeast on all three.

I let her know that I wasn't interested in a token female, that my interest in seeing more women involved was genuine... and that I'd love to see this as an ongoing, not a temporary, thing.  We messages back and forth a bit, and then, the idea of BrewUnited started gaining traction.  Well, last week, she and I messaged again.  Now that BrewUnited is a reality, it seemed like a great time for her to officially step on board; today is an introduction post from her.

Spin on the stir plate for 24-48 hours, cold crash overnight, decant liquid and let the culture warm up as I brew. After chilling and whirlpooling, while I let everything settle I will pull about 500ml of cooled wort into the flask with the yeast (not really sure if this does anything at all, it's just what I do). After everything settles out, I'll transfer into the carboy and pitch."
Homebrewing,3d5if4,Leftblackedout,3,Mon Jul 13 20:09:06 2015 UTC,This is my preferred method as well.
Homebrewing,3d5if4,nzo,2,Mon Jul 13 20:48:43 2015 UTC,I really like this method.  The one time I decanted I had a hard time getting all the yeast out.
Homebrewing,3d5if4,chino_brews,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"I suspect it could have an effect on the beer. If you make a 2L starter, that's more than 10% of a 5 gallon (18.9 L) batch.   Try tasting starter beer. The best thing you can say for it is that it's not the same as the beer you are making (unless your beer is an unhopped light DME beer).   If someone told you they'd like to come into your house when you're not home, and blend in 10% of this starter beer into every batch before you bottle it, do you think that would improve or worsen your beer's flavor?"
Homebrewing,3d5if4,opiate82,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:18 2015 UTC,"I think it is probably a best practice to decant. In theory that starter wort is going to be full of esters. However, I routinely pitch starter wort (or I guess beer at that point) and all and as far as I can tell I haven't ruined a beer yet, but have no side-by-side comparisons to say for sure if it makes a difference or not.   I generally will only pitch the whole thing if it is a smallish starter though, anything over 1L in volume and I decant, not only to avoid potential off flavors, but just to keep all my volumes in line with the original recipe as well."
Homebrewing,3d5if4,deltrino,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:33:36 2015 UTC,"If you crash and decant, aren't you reducing the vitality of the yeast?  I would think a hybrid method would be pretty good.  One where you make your starter, decant, then add a bit of wort from your mash, spin for 4-7 hrs, then pitch."
Homebrewing,3d5if4,FuzzeWuzze,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"Not really?  You may be inducing a slightly longer lag time, but you can fix that by bringing it back up to room temperature before pitching.  Or not if your doing a lager, just throw it in cold."
Homebrewing,3d5if4,Jendall,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"I think it does reduce the vitality. Not the viability, but that's a different thing."
Homebrewing,3d5if4,fenderfreek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:22:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe over a month or two. Chilling overnight isn't going to affect the yeast in any meaningful way. If anything, chilling helps encourage trehalose production, which functions as a stress protectant."
Homebrewing,3d5if4,Darthtagnan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"It's not difficult to cold crash and decant, so I have always done it. The first time I made a starter, I gave the starter beer taste and decided that I did not want any of it, or rather as little as possible - in my fresh wort. Starter beer is typically tart and full of esters. The impact may be negligible, but I tend to err on the side of caution."

Homebrewing,3d5i9o,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"It seems like you know what you're doing, so sorry to comment if you've got it covered. You're probably already aware that yeasts like Scotch Whisky, Neutral Grain Spirits, or WLP099 Super High Gravity are used as a second pitch when the primary strain can't attenuate anymore, so you can get the beer-like esters from a beer yeast, and then the final attenuation from a distillers or high gravity yeast, without making something that tastes like turpentine. Wyeast 1728, fermented low, is a classic Strong Scotch Ale yeast that will get you all the character you expect in a Wee Heavy. If it gets stuck, then you move on to any distiller's yeast (the strain doesn't really matter at that point)."
Homebrewing,3d5i9o,sleepybandit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:00:11 2015 UTC,The website specifically says:    Suitable for Scotch Whisky or American-style Whiskey. Used in high-gravity beers.   It might be used as a second pitch when attempting to make a high gravity beer but White Labs does not recommend it for a beer style like it does for all of their beer strains.  I agree with /u/chino_brews.  I wouldn't use it as a primary yeast strain for a beer.    It sounds like you've already bought the yeast and may just go for it despite the feedback.  I would expect a product that doesn't taste very good at all.  Likely pretty hot alcohol flavors.
Homebrewing,3d5i9o,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:08:16 2015 UTC,I was planning on using it as a first pitch. Thanks for the advice that's why I posted here.   Go with WLP028 Edinburgh Scottish Ale instead?   I always make a 2L starter

I don't think you're going to find a viable solution that allows you to use a chest freezer simultaneously for fermenting and serving."
Homebrewing,3d566c,TheGremlyn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:48:07 2015 UTC,This. If you can make it 60 inches you could even do 3. My 4.4cf mini fridge is 20 inches wide and fits a 6.5gal bucket or 2 5 gal ball locks. You could also probably get them pretty cheap compared to a chest freezer.
Homebrewing,3d566c,rouest,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:05:26 2015 UTC,I have a mini upright freezer that I picked up for free. The freezer isn't a frost free model though so the coils act as the shelves. There isn't even enough room for a 1 gal carboy. I know plenty of people have successfully bent them however I don't feel confident in my ability to not ruin the freezer. I've just been using it for hops and malt cold storage.  I have considered running draft lines from kegs outside that freezer through a ton of stainless steel coil inside the freezer with the temp set somewhere above freezing. Would that chill my brew down enough? Otherwise I might just buy kegging equipment so I can force carb and then bottle from the keg. That cuts out the carbonation time and still leaves me with a nice fermentation chamber.
Homebrewing,3d566c,TheGremlyn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"Bending is generally very easy. Just use a large can of beans or similar to make sure it doesn't kink.  The problem with running the lines thorugh the fridge, like a large jockey box, is that your beer has to be at room temp all the time, which is less than ideal for longer term storage (especially if the ambient temp will swing). You're a lot more likely to encounter foaming issues that way too.  If your mini-fridge was free then you won't lose much if you do happen to screw it up, though it's pretty unlikely that you will. You could post a pic of the freezer plate here and we can let you know if ti should work or not.  Unfortunately in your situation, just whatever you can get your hands on free or cheap may not suit your needs and you might want to consider buying the appropriately sized fridges that won't require modification, especially if you're squeamish about trying it."
Homebrewing,3d566c,mitchard,2,Mon Jul 13 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"As much as I love kegging, fermentation temperature control should be the first thing to worry about. Realistically, you COULD make it work, but it would involve raising the temps up for fermentation, then lowering them back down to serving temps when you're done. It'll work if you are just going to have one beer on at a time, otherwise you'll be serving up warm beer for 2+ weeks while the fermentation temps are in place. I'd rather keep bottling if this was my situation.   As noted in the other comment, two independent mini fridges would work a lot better for what you're trying to do."

Homebrewing,3d566c,qvantamon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:12 2015 UTC,If you have the room for a side by side refrigerator you can find one cheap off craigslist and modify it to be a dual purpose fermentation chamber and kegerator.  The fridge side acts as the fermentation chamber and the freezer side works as a kegerator.    I only have two taps currently but have room for up to 4 kegs if I put the gas in the fridge side or outside of the unit.  I didn't take too many pictures of my build but I got the idea from another guy who built one and posted it here.  I was in a similar situation of wanting to do both but not having space for an individual dedicated fermentation chamber and kegerator so this way I get the best of both.
Homebrewing,3d566c,El_Mikey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"Picobrew's kegsmarts tries to do this by having fermentation kegs wrapped in a heating element with an isolating cozy. They claim their kegerator can manage to keep a keg all the way down to 34 while the fermenting one is at 65. This sounds like it would waste a lot of energy (the compressor and heater running near constantly to keep the differential), but I guess I'll wait and see the reviews. If it somehow works, I'm fairly tempted (I already ferment in kegs)."

Homebrewing,3d2vyu,qi3ber,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"Hah! That's pretty neat, I think this might be a good resource for me when I next make something like this. Though, I do like processing the ingredients a bit old-fashioned, like juicing the lemons myself. But besides that, this does look nice! I'm unsure what the Potassium metabisulfite (Kmeta) and Potassium sorbate (sorbate) accomplish, however.  The recipe is:  For a 5 gallon batch  3 bottles of 32 oz 100% lemon juice (e.g ReaLemon in the green plastic bottles or equivalent)  7 lbs sugar (or 16 cups) to ferment  3/4 tsp tannin  6 tsp. yeast nutrient (3 now, 3 later)  2 tsp. yeast energizer (1 now, 1 later)  Approx, 4 1/2 gallons water  Yeast Slurry  Potassium metabisulfite (Kmeta)  Potassium sorbate (sorbate)  Sparkolloid  2 1/3 lbs sugar (or 6 cups) to sweeten finished Skeeter Pee. Use more or less for your tastes."
Homebrewing,3d2vyu,qi3ber,4,Mon Jul 13 03:24:00 2015 UTC,"So after making a ton of batches I've simplified to exclude the tannin, and yeast killing additions (both potassium additions) because I keg.  Also,  is a great base recipe to play with, adding other flavors to play with (blueberry,  pomegranate, cherry,  etc), and back sweetening to make it more or less tart depending on the weather."

Paraphrasing him, those are scary chemicals that professional vintners will use to kill odd bugs in the juice.  He doesn't use it, and recommended that I not worry about it."
Homebrewing,3d2vyu,eschybach,3,Mon Jul 13 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, your LHBS guy is an asshole.  K-Meta is potassium metabisulphite (sodium metabisulphite will also do the job) and is sold in a powder or in tablets called Campden tablets.  It will stop yeast activity (or, rather, the sulfites it releases will).  Potassium sorbate will prevent yeast from reproducing, so when you use both together, you can effectively ""stabilize"" a wine so that it will no longer ferment.  This isn't strictly necessary if you're not backsweetening, but the skeeter pee recipe calls for back sweetening with 6 cups of sugar.  That's a lot of sugar.  It's way more than enough sugar to cause bottle bombs ifwhen the yeast starts fermenting again.  You could always skip backsweetening, but I've tried completely dry skeeter pee, and it's unpleasant."

Homebrewing,3d098c,RenegadeZed,2,Mon Jul 13 00:14:40 2015 UTC,The dripping? I think it's just the design of the taps. There is a space between the seal and the restrictor plate where beer pools and then drips.

Homebrewing,3d098c,pixelrebel,4,Sun Jul 12 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"As important as it is to pour a beer correctly, I think Guinness is a bad example: they have labelled and packaged ""the correct pour"" to better advertise the product. It feels classier/more authentic when the brewery set out a very  strict method of pouring for people to follow."
Homebrewing,3d098c,splunge4me2,2,Sun Jul 12 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Guinness uses this to market it a lot.  The method is very practical for nitro pours. If you haven't poured nitro before it makes a big difference because it prevents a lot of head production. In darker beers that are on the bitter end, too much foam can degrade the taste of the beer.  Heck I would among say on head is good for a nitro pour but I admit that it looks so much better with the head."

Homebrewing,3d55hb,MrKrinkle151,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"No, but either way it's related to wheat. I first noticed the bubble-gum flavor drinking commercial wheat beers, and I've homebrewed with wheat a few times. Despite using different yeasts, every time I taste bubble-gum and it drives me nuts.  For instance, I went to a nice bar and had a sour saison this weekend (I don't recall the brewery), and got a nice hint of bubble-gum. Saison isn't usually ""wheat heavy"", but I noticed the bubble-gum flavor anyway. Plus, it's pretty likely they used a saison yeast rather than a classic yeast for wheat beer like, say, 3068. I have the same ""bubble-gum"" problem with Farm Girl, Dancing Man (before they discontinued it), and a few other beers I can't recall right now. It always seems to come back to wheat being in the grain bill."
Homebrewing,3d55hb,MrKrinkle151,2,Mon Jul 13 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"Some saison strains, some hef strains, and lots of general Belgian strains give off bubble gum esters, so that would make sense. Wheat itself is not know for these flavors. I'd wager that what you're tasting are common yeast-derived esters and you've just attributed it to wheat since it often co-occurs in these styles."
Homebrewing,3d55hb,MrKrinkle151,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:43:28 2015 UTC,But even 1056 gives me that flavor if there is wheat in the grain bill... (source: my own homebrew)
Homebrewing,3d55hb,drummerinattic,2,Mon Jul 13 18:51:04 2015 UTC,"Idk then man. Does bread taste like bubblegum, too? Wheat just isn't known to impart a bubblegum flavor, but all the beers you say you've tasted it in use yeasts that do. Perhaps your attribution has led you to associate the flavor with wheat, so now you expect it, and thus perceive it. Even if it is psychological, I suppose it doesn't matter as long as you're able to get rid of the flavor."
Homebrewing,3d55hb,mutedog,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:38:24 2015 UTC,"Fair point, maybe I've developed an association I can't quite shake. I'll do an exBEERiment with 3724 yeast with no wheat in the grain bill and find out."
Homebrewing,3d55hb,drummerinattic,3,Mon Jul 13 20:46:58 2015 UTC,"The bubblegum flavor/smell is almost certainly an ester from the yeast traditionally used to ferment weizens and similar beers. Adding wheat to a saison and fermenting it with a traditional saison yeast won't make it taste like bubblegum. That being said, you can totally make a saison without yeast."
Homebrewing,3d55hb,MrKrinkle151,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"I think you meant to say wheat, you'd have a hard time making a saison (or any beer) without yeast."

Homebrewing,3d4n6d,jableshables,2,Mon Jul 13 14:43:22 2015 UTC,"The heat shouldn't be a problem -- if anything, it'll just result in more quickly carbonated bottles. Assuming you didn't bottle too soon, the amount of priming sugar you add is the limiting factor. Everything you described sounds like normal yeast activity.  It's not entirely impossible that you have an infection, but it doesn't seem likely. If the flavor starts to noticeably change and the bottles start gushing when you open them, then you should worry."
Homebrewing,3d4m4x,mexicanlizards,2,Mon Jul 13 14:08:22 2015 UTC,I don't know this for sure but... if the coolant is low it can cause the compressor in your AC system to freeze the bottom portion of the unit and damage it.

Homebrewing,3d2ohj,treemoustache,2,Mon Jul 13 14:54:17 2015 UTC,"I do the same as he does, I think. I don't ever ""wash"". I usually make a monster starter, then pitch some of it into a separate jar, then make more starters and repeat the process for as long as I feel like.  And to answer your question -- no, you make the starter in advance (not on brew day) and you just decant and dump the yeast into the new starter. When I collect the yeast for later use, I just vac-seal the mason jar shut with my FoodSaver masonjar-attachment.  Been doing this for years without issue."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,SpyderFoode,2,Mon Jul 13 16:02:47 2015 UTC,"I just shake it up and pitch it. I harvest it in a 2 litre pickle jar, and that's big enough to not need a starter. A little flavour from the last batch makes it into the new one, but that doesn't bother me."

Homebrewing,3d2ohj,famousmodification,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:08:47 2015 UTC,This.  I find that my success with harvesting yeast really depends on the type of beer that I'm harvesting it from. More trub = more problems.   That's why I switched to /u/brulosopher 's method.

Homebrewing,3d2ohj,morehpperliter,3,Mon Jul 13 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"On a somewhat related note, I think I'm going to start collecting the krausen instead of yeast washing. I'll fill my carboy high enough that I need a blowoff tube, but instead of running the tube into a bucket of water, I'm going to run it into a sanitized vessel with two openings. The first opening will be for the blowoff hose, and the second will be for an airlock. From what I can tell, that should give me a bunch of healthy yeast under a small amount of sterile beer.

Homebrewing,3d2ohj,msudawgs55,4,Mon Jul 13 01:56:48 2015 UTC,The best/easiest way is to overbuild your starters. That means harvesting BEFORE pitching.   Check out: http://brulosophy.com/methods/yeast-harvesting/
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,Stinky_Fartface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what I have been doing for years now and it works great. Much easier and more reliable than washing yeast."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,cowboys703,0,Mon Jul 13 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"Much easier and more reliable than washing yeast.   Doing it beforehand doesn't take away this step, but then again it doesnt change the lack of necessity of said step for the average homebrewer, so it doesn't matter. Agreed however, that it's easier versus harvesting post-fermentation.  But even without hops, you're still creating trub whether in a starter or in a 5gallon carboy."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,twistedtxb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"True, but I just pour the beer off the top after the trub has settled out. I never add any sanitized water. So yes, it's washing but it's simpler than the process most people use when reclaiming yeast from the bottom of their fermentors. And I have found yeast cultured this was is vibrant and happy and makes many great beers."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,cowboys703,3,Tue Jul 14 12:23:11 2015 UTC,"As far as I've learned, the yeast you collect from previous fermentation can be used for multiple brews.  Just do a starter with it before pitching.  Though, after so many generations, the yeast could be stressed and may produce off flavors."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,whmeh0,3,Mon Jul 13 03:45:38 2015 UTC,If you overbuild your starter you could just collect from there and (I believe) you could harvest them indefinitely since it's such a mild OG and no hops to screw things up.
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,chino_brews,2,Mon Jul 13 08:17:22 2015 UTC,"A million times this.  I find it so weird that there are so many guides out there about yeast washing, while you could just do the simple way with a larger starter."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:11:51 2015 UTC,I was looking into it and was put off by how iffy the whole thing was. It seemed risky to do without some way of telling if the yeast were getting too stressed out or were damaged in some way.   This way I'm fairly confident that I have a supply of yeast on hand that is probably much greater than any smack pack could offer me.   One thing I kind of want to look into is long term storage. I saw a thread on here once about someone who was freezing yeast using propolyne glycol so he could have a failsafe batch on hand for any screw up for a long time.
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:21:31 2015 UTC,I just read Brulosopher's article on it and in the future this is the route I'm going to go.  Seems cleaner.

Homebrewing,3d2ohj,b0hica,2,Mon Jul 13 04:30:08 2015 UTC,"did I do it right?   Maybe not. Depends on what you're going for. Actually rinsing yeast has detrimental effects per the yeast labs.  Besides the idea of overbuilding starters, if you're going to harvest yeast from a yeast cake, I like the method I learned from Denny Conn, and I don't harvest from yeast cakes where I used gelatin:  (1) When you rack, leave a little beer behind. (2) Swirl up the yeast cake and beer. (3) Let it settle for around 10-20 minutes. The trub will mostly settle while the yeast mostly remain in suspension at this point in time. (4) Pour off the cloudy beer into sanitized jars, leaving behind the trub. Store in the fridge. (5) Repeat steps (1) - (4) on the jars and consolidate into one sanitized jar if you wish. (6) Pitch this yeast within about three weeks, and after that use it to make a starter."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,gormster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks again Chino!  I have yet to use gelatin to clear (cold crashing for now), so I'll keep that on in the memory bank for when I do use it.  Though, in the future, it seems I'll be going the route of overbuilding a starter to harvest some off.    As for that process, that's what I did, except with including sanitized water.  I swirled the cake at the bottom of the fermenter, let it settle, and then poured off the top into my big jar, leaving the trub behind (or it looks like in my case, most of the trub behind).  I had about 4-6 sanitized jars that I boiled filled with the same boiled water.  After a few more minutes of settling and stratificating, I poured into the smaller jars.  After a day of cold crash, I poured the smaller jars into this jar and this was my end result."
Homebrewing,3d2ohj,Jumping_Koalas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"That's what the yeast labs are recommending against -- using sanitized water. You don't want to rinse yeast at all -- just leave it on the beer, apparently. (The idea of yeast rinsing is based on a misinterpretation of a small study on yeast lab did on storing yeast under distilled water, but it can't be replicated in homebrew conditions because of both how they prepped the yeast and the fact that it requires the yeast to be ultra pure).  And of course, you can't wash yeast like this because it yeast washing requires the presence of an acid.  I'd try doing the same thing next time, but with beer instead of water. It's all anecdotal, but I feel like my slurries got healthier when I stopped rinsing with water."

Besides the massive investment in equipment, the yeast strains themselves are odd compared to liquid yeast, and are designed to floc with dead yeast cells and starch to form tiny granules. You don't have a pure source for such yeast, and why would you want to do this when you can buy a pack of US-05 for $3-5.  However, that doesn't mean you can't dry yeast at home. I've read a couple sources where they claim that excess sourdough starter was used to chink the logs in log cabins during American pioneer times, and that people have recovered and revived yeast over a hundred years later. They used to press yeast into cakes in English breweries, dry them, and then store them in warm months, to be re-used when brewing started up again with cool weather.  I've shipped yeast to people by making sterile foil packets with gauze inside, and then drying a few drops of yeast on the gauze. You can revive the yeast in a few ml of wort, and step them up. It was a common way for people to trade yeast strains in the 1990s, I think."

If you could have gotten the wort into the 60s°F or 50s°F, then you probably would have had much clearer wort.  Nevertheless, taking trub over to the fermentor is not necessarily harmful, and may have some beneficial effects on yeast health and later beer clarity, so I wouldn't worry about it. A lot of advanced brewers just dump or siphon their entire kettle into the fermentor.  Also, in terms of terminology, at the stage where you are bringing your hot wort to pitching temps, it's called ""chilling"" wort. ""Cold crashing"" is what you do when your fermentation is finished and you want to chill the beer to near-freezing to encourage settling of yeast and other particulates."

Homebrewing,3d2sa6,Louiemacgoo,2,Mon Jul 13 01:48:37 2015 UTC,What kind of fermentor is that?
Homebrewing,3d2sa6,Youngstiffy,2,Mon Jul 13 02:20:45 2015 UTC,It's made by a company called BrewDemon. It's called the Big Demon 7 gallon conicle fermenter. http://www.beerborg.com/index/2015/07/brewdemon-big-demon-conical-fermenter-first-impressions/

Homebrewing,3d39ke,Jmacadocious,4,Mon Jul 13 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"Fermentation uh... finds a way.  It's probably fine, and possibly disastrous."
Homebrewing,3d39ke,Fenix159,3,Mon Jul 13 04:30:03 2015 UTC,I put the whole batch in a tub incase whatever is going on tries any funny business!
Homebrewing,3d39ke,Fenix159,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"Good choice, probably ok though.  I've had that happen a few times, nothing came of it. Certainly can't hurt to make sure they're well contained though."
Homebrewing,3d39ke,AT-JeffT,2,Mon Jul 13 04:36:44 2015 UTC,3 out of 42 bottles have this strange ring at the top.
Homebrewing,3d39ke,AT-JeffT,2,Mon Jul 13 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"Did you bottle it a few days ago?  If so, I'm willing to bet that those 3 have defective caps."
Homebrewing,3d39ke,bludluzt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"I bottled on Friday, are you thinking something snuck in from the bad cap?"
Homebrewing,3d39ke,EskimoDave,3,Mon Jul 13 05:47:08 2015 UTC,"No, Those caps aren't sealing correctly.  They are letting co2 out and that is what is causing the foam.  Watch one of those bottles for co2 bubbles going from the bottom to the top."
Homebrewing,3d39ke,scootunit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:03:23 2015 UTC,"Second. Looks like leakage from the cap, reducing pressure in the headspace and allowing CO2 to come out of solution - hence the bubbles.   You could try immersing one of the bottles in water and seeing if any bubbles come up. I can't remember if Heineken's are twist off or not but twist offs don't seal very well."
Homebrewing,3d39ke,scootunit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:23:39 2015 UTC,looks like fermentation in the bottle.
Homebrewing,3d39ke,gman57Z3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:26:21 2015 UTC,At first I thought it was bubbles but then I zoomed in and it looks like boogers.  I suspect you got three bottles that were not clean enough.  Share your bottle washing regimen for analysis.
Homebrewing,3d39ke,raptor9999,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:27:37 2015 UTC,I soak bottles in hot oxyclean water for 30 to 40 minutes rinse lightly then put them in my dishwasher on sanitize with extra heat turned on.  Let them cool a bit then bottle up.
Homebrewing,3d39ke,chino_brews,2,Mon Jul 13 04:32:45 2015 UTC,I do similarly but I then spray a spritz of star San and slosh it around before I bottle.

There is far far far to much to teach you in one page, you will have to get onto youtube and start your education. I had put in a cumulative week of study before even using an extract kit.  One tip! Do not open the fermenter to take a picture just to ask us is it looking okay. It will be. Just keep it closed until you are ready to bottle and everything will be fine."

Homebrewing,3d3nzp,somethin_brewin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:41:43 2015 UTC,That's some very different equipment than I'm used to seeing in my area. What's the rig on the right? Looks like some sort of autobrewer with a conical attached.
Homebrewing,3d3nzp,K1LOS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:43:40 2015 UTC,It's a WilliamsWarn.  It's a $6k extract auto-brewery.

Homebrewing,3d3nzp,K1LOS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no.  It's more of a fermenter + kegerator.  You could certainly make all-grain in an all-grain setup (for example, on what appears to be a Grainfather in the middle of the picture) and ferment it in the device."
Homebrewing,3d3nzp,3Vyf7nm4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:18:04 2015 UTC,"Honest tip for first time homebrewer, make 5 extract kits that ferment cleanly and have no sanitation or oxidization issues. Your equipment will help you make good wort but until you know what to do with good wort, you'll never know if your problems are pre or post fermentation."
Homebrewing,3d3nzp,btone911,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:45:17 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about the contraption on the right.  And for tips, that's a really nebulous question.

Homebrewing,3d3nzp,jwalkermed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"Don't spend too much on kit at first. Oops, too late!  Seriously, I'm not quite sure how you go about brewing on a setup like that, but here's a piece of sound advice: if you're using dry yeast, rehydrate it per manufacturer's instructions even if a kit says it OK not to (or don't), and if you're using liquid yeast then use an online pitching rate calculator to determine number of viable cells compared to how many you need, and make a yeast starter to propagate the cells you need."
Homebrewing,3d3nzp,chino_brews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome set up you have there.  To add to some of the advice already given here, be patient! Cleaning, sanitizing, fermenting and conditioning all take time even when you do it properly"

Homebrewing,3d3nzp,MrButters,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:30:52 2015 UTC,"The salty comments in this thread :D hahaha.  Honestly I think you should do like a 5 gallon extract brew, simple hop schedule at 60 min, 30 min, maybe 5-0 min additions.  Think through how you are going to cool the wort, since I see no such equipment.  The two important things for you as a beginner, CLEANING AND SANITATION.  Also, use the Q&A-thread instead of trolling/karmawhoring like this."
Homebrewing,3d1ayl,geebr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"Would you consider that hopstand addition in the video a hopstand addition, or a 0 minute/flameout addition?  I know there are cuts in the video, but it makes it loook like the hops sit in such hot wort that is reported to iso-something-ize the hops."
Homebrewing,3d1ayl,olds808esm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:00:34 2015 UTC,"iirc, hops will isomerize in wort that is below boiling temps, it just takes longer.  That is why post-flameout hop additions will still add some bittering."

Homebrewing,3cwq3l,HomeBrewTalk,2,Sat Jul 11 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"Ha. Thats literally my point. Use them in place of the bittering hops. Would be cool to do a brew with this and some citrus/floral late additions as a sort of gin and tonic flavor, but it would take some work to figure out how much quinine to add to get the bitterness just right."

Homebrewing,3cwq3l,colonelpan1c,3,Sat Jul 11 17:17:24 2015 UTC,"1 1/2 cups unbleached flour 1 1/2 cups spent grains (dried and milled) 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt And 12oz of whatever beer you like, my advice stick the style the grains were used for for a more simple flavor. You can use more or less spent grains depending on the flavor you want. Again depends on the style but more flour gets a standard pizza dough taste and more grain gives you a maltier dough."

Homebrewing,3cysar,hedgecore77,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"As they sit, they don't. You would still need a temperature controlled chamber, but SS BrewTech does sell a temperature control system for these that consists of an immersion coil inside the fermenter and a insulating jacket for the fermenter. You still need to provide a source of cool liquid to pump through the coil though."
Homebrewing,3cysar,CaptainRedBeerd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:07:37 2015 UTC,Is this how most production breweries control temps?  I know when I went to Annheiser Busch they had a cold room where the fermenters were.  Other breweries I've been to have room temp or warmer.
Homebrewing,3cysar,CaptainRedBeerd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"Many breweries use glycol jacketed fermenters to control temperature. I've heard of some smaller ones using walk-in fridges or temperature controlled rooms, but I think glycol jacketed fermenters are more common."

Probably the closest option to you but I haven't checked it out personally yet. In Anaheim you have two options; Addison Homebrew and Phantom Ales. Personally, I prefer Phantom for their cheaper prices and friendlier staff (although depending on who is working, less knowledgeable). It's also nice to have a beer while you are shopping for your next recipe. Addison is great for learning as a beginner with their monthly brew exhibitions but they are the same process every month which I find disappointing."

Scott, the owner, is very knowledgable and nice. Plus they have a HUGE selection compared to the other shops I've been to in Orange County, (though I admittedly haven't been to Addison.) They have tons of yeast, grain, wine kits and every fathomable piece of equipment and its replacement fittings. We went on July 4th and he and a friend were brewing and celebrating in the store so they could help anyone that needed supplies that day. It is also a very short walk to grab a few pints at Barley Forge, which is hard to beat."

S-05 would give a nice summer Citra pale ale?   Citra wheat? Same idea as above, but keep the bu/gu to 0.4-0.5. I would mash lower (150 or so) because I like wheat beers dry. Simple grist of 50/50 pale malt and wheat. Mix in some orange peel and lemon peel to play off the Citra at flame out? Again, clean ale yeast.   Citra saison? Pilsner malt to about 1.060, mash low, Citra to your ibu level of choice, and saison yeast?   I don't know. It's early, I'm trying to fall back asleep after putting a pork butt on the smoker.

Then as the sacch, brett, lacto and pedio take over, the enterobacteria die out. I think it was posited that perhaps the compounds they make in this short time contribute to the particular flavor of belgian sours.  Has anybody tried replicating this at home? I'm thinking after the boil I just place the pot outside to cool (it's winter here) uncovered for 24 hours, then transfer to a fermenter and then pitch a tube of some sort of sour blend. Thoughts?"

Homebrewing,3d09kk,raptor9999,2,Sun Jul 12 12:06:42 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you can go ahead and pitch. Saisons like to ferment warm (70f-80f)

Homebrewing,3d09kk,zVulture,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:12:59 2015 UTC,"Belgian strain yeasts can really take on the heat.  I have seen people swearing to bring them up to 80F-85F [26C-29C], and some closer of 90F [32C] after the first 3 days of fermentation (lower at first to prevent fusel alcohols).  French strain is closer to a pale ale yeast that produces enough esters at lower temps that it doesn't need higher temps.  To answer your question, I almost always pitch higher than my fermentation temperature as long as it's in range for the yeast.  If anything colder temps can slow down the initial yeast production.  I recently had a starter self-warming at 80F and my wart was 80F so I just pitched it and let my ferm vessel chill it down to my target temp.  Had the beer at high krousen and just a little (2F) above my target temp when I checked it in the morning (~10-12H later)."

Homebrewing,3d09kk,zVulture,3,Sun Jul 12 15:07:41 2015 UTC,Adding to the fermenter doesn't matter.  You use the heat to pull soluble protein out of the wart.

My kettle is 7.5 gallons, though, which is large enough to do a full volume boil but definitely too small to mash in. I have another 5 gallon pot, can I just split the mash into two pots and then combine them before boiling? I was thinking I'd just split the strike water, with 3/5 in the bigger pot and the rest in the smaller one, and split the grain roughly proportional to that."
Homebrewing,3d09kk,zVulture,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"I do BIAB in a 8 gallon kettle just fine.  You don't need to use all your water for the mash!  Done BIAB + Decoction, BIAB + Step Mash and just BIAB before all in that.  Basically bring up 4-5 gallons of water to your strike temp with the bag opened up around the pot lip.  Pour in your grain and add a little more water if your short (better short than too much).  Direct fire that sucker up to your mash temp if your a bit low (benefit of BIAB), just make sure the bag isn't touching the bottom of the pot.  You can leave the bag it on the rim like a garbage bag too.  Generally for this process, I leave myself 1 gallon of Distilled Water and put it in the fridge.  After chilling my wart down to ~80 I dump the last gallon in (never had infection issue, just starsan the cap before using).  This helps bring down my temp quickly without having to use more ice or water."

Homebrewing,3d09kk,zVulture,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Generally you should grab your gravity before the boil as a good practice.  This allows you to verify you didn't somehow miss the Gravity you wanted (remember boil will increase the gravity a little, vice versa if you dilute your runnings).  To calculate you could use a calculator like this one or get a program like Beersmith that helps you set your efficiency to adjust your grain bill."
Homebrewing,3d09kk,C-30,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:02:22 2015 UTC,But using beersmith or a calculator doesn't take into consideration how long the sugar was boiled and I'm guessing assumes it was used in the mash?
Homebrewing,3d09kk,zVulture,2,Sun Jul 12 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"Beersmith takes into account the sugars being added just fine, I do this for my IPA that I add table sugar to.  Even so, you can get a mash gravity reading before you go to the boil (before you add the sugar). Then use that reading instead of your FG to calculate efficiency, just exclude the sugar off your ingredient list too (on the calculator)."
Homebrewing,3d09kk,C-30,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:15:02 2015 UTC,Ah.. So you're saying it doesn't matter at what point the sugar is added to the boil. It will effect the gravity the same?
Homebrewing,3d09kk,zVulture,2,Sun Jul 12 15:23:04 2015 UTC,Sugar doesn't change efficiency at all.  Caramelization can change how much is ferment able in the final wart.  Efficiency is how much sugar you get out of your grain and only your grain compared to the potential sugars you could have gotten out. It's there to help you calculate how much of a grain bill you would need to hit the same gravity of wart.
Homebrewing,3d09kk,chino_brews,2,Sun Jul 12 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"How long the sugar is boiled is not relevant to efficiency.  Beersmith will include the sugar in the ratio, just like it would extract if you used a partial mash method, and because you get 100% efficiency on the sugar portion (which is true), you get higher efficiency.  If you want to calculate your true mash efficiency, you can back the sugar out of the bill of fermentable said and then take your pre-boil volume and SG to calculate it."

Bonus question: I have seen some debate that natural carbonation is smoother and vice versa. Any thoughts on that?   CO2 is CO2. When it comes to commercial brewers, it may make a difference when it comes to packaging a pasteurized product vs. packaging a beer with live yeast, in terms of maturation in the bottle and shelf life. When it comes to homebrew, I don't taste a difference."

Scratch that, I wish I could buy you the ingredients to make a beer haha. Thanks for answering all my questions.   It's not a solution to fixing an already-oxidized beer, though.   On that note, my hypothetical situation. If I transport a keg of freshly racked beer (with little to no oxygen exposure beforehand) and the remaining oxygen in the headspace of the keg (after purging, lets assume there is some) gets ""into solution"" via splashing on the car ride, would natural carbonation be of benefit to me in removing that oxygen, or is the damage already done? I guess what I'm asking is, is oxidation immediate or does it take time?"
Homebrewing,3d09kk,chino_brews,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:53:40 2015 UTC,"Very interesting questions.   Well, to seal the keg you have to pressurize it, right? And if you purge the headspace three times, that gets the headspace down to 9000 ppm of O2 and the whole keg is 1500 ppm (if you assume the headspace is about 1/6 of the total corny keg volume.  I think 100 ppm is recommended for homebrewing, and < 100 ppb is the gold standard for commercial brewing).   If you purge the head space five times (seems excessive, right?), then that's down to 400 ppm in the headspace, and something like 67 ppm in the whole corney, which is great. You wouldn't need to do anything as long as you didn't oxidize your beer before pressurizing the keg.  Now, if you don't want to do that, if you have the same ratio of headspace as is in a bottle, and you rack a beer with live yeast and prime it before sealing the keg, the yeast will consume the O2 in the keg, just as they do in a bottle or any sealed package.   is oxidation immediate or does it take time?   I'm not sure. I think oxidation takes time to develop (certainly for oxidized flavors to develop). When bottling beers, we are careful to try to avoid oxidizing beer, but it's also true that the yeast ""scrub"" oxygen from the sealed package by consuming it in the re-fermentation process (and which is why there are shipping breweries that could totally pasteurize and/or filter and force carb, but instead bottle condition for at least part of the carb).  You want to buy me a beer? If you can ship in the U.S., you can sign up for a beer review BrewUnited and request me as a judge. Or any of the credentialed and more-qualified judges through the site. Just saying."

I've been doing some research of my own on the idea of oxygen-use by the yeast at the re-fermentation stage and found a lot of conflicting information. Some have stated that the yeast have switched to anaerobic fermentation after the initial lag phase where they need O2 to multiply and don't make use of the oxygen introduced while bottling. Others have said that regardless of the yeast phase, they will favor the use of the O2 versus the absence of it. It is interesting stuff.  Ultimately, I'm just trying to find the best solution for my circumstances -- where I need to move the beer after racking out of the primary. I think I'm going to purge the keg with sanitizer beforehand, drive to the brew site, rack into the keg, purge headspace as many times as my little CO2 charger will allow me to, and bring the beer back to my apartment to force carbonate. If i detect any oxidation flavors, I'll try natural carbonation and see if that resolves anything. The real solution here is to buy a house and get the hell out of my apartment where I have to brew 10 miles away haha."

Anyways, I had this issue once before which resolved after I put it in the tub. I'm now seeing little to no bubbles. So either the yeast died or consumed all the sugar. What should I do?"

Homebrewing,3d09kk,shoulderdeep,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:32:45 2015 UTC,it looks like the bucket im fermenting in doesn't have a tight seal. i even switched lids and it did noting. i think its getting toward the end of vigorous fermentation if not there. should i switch to a different bucket. i also have a better bottle but am having some trouble cleaning it out so i think the new bucket would be the way to go. thanks
Homebrewing,3d09kk,geezerpk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:53:07 2015 UTC,Don't worry about the seal on the bucket. I haven't sealed a fermenting bucket in years and never had a problem. I just set the lid on the top and put a pound or so weight on it. Saves a lot of pain a misery prying pry a sealed lid off.

Homebrewing,3d09kk,UselessFactOrFiction,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:31:51 2015 UTC,Yep
Homebrewing,3d09kk,chino_brews,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"OK, then your beer is almost certainly done. The thing with refractometers is that you need to use the OG and SG on the Brix scale and plug it into a refractometer calculator (online or in brewing app) to get the true SG. Reason: refractometers measure the refraction of light through fructose solution. The refractive index of wort is within ~ 4%, so they work fine for wort. But the refractive index of alcohol is very different, so you can't take the SG of beer using a refractometer unless you know the OG and can use a formula to apply a correction factor (doing this with a calculator is easiest). Hope that helps.  alcohol is differen"

Homebrewing,3d09kk,chino_brews,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"If you match the Lovibond color, it won't matter.  FYI, all of the major British malts tears make Vienna: Crisp, Baird, Simpson, and Fawcett - except Munton & Fison."
Homebrewing,3d09kk,DeadNerd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"So those makes are just for color? I clicked on Vienna in the recipe and it said the color is 4*L. So any malt with that color works?   Also, what is the PPG that is listed on the malt pages? For example, the Vienna say 35 PPG.   Thank you!"
Homebrewing,3d09kk,chino_brews,2,Sun Jul 12 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"Not any malt that the same color in °L will work, but any Vienna malt that is 3.5-5°L will be so close that you will probably be unable to tell the difference (unless you are a high-level beer judge).  The PPG is the extract potential of the malt, in gravity points (P) per pound (P) per gallon (G). This means that one pound of this malt mashed to make one gallon of wort will yield 35 gravity points ASSUMING 100% efficiency, or a wort of 1.035, or five gallons of wort at 1.007 (= 35 gravity points / 5 gallons = 7 gravity points per gallon). Realistically, if you can 70% efficiency and used 10 lbs. of Vienna Malt to make Vienna Lager, you'd get 5 gallons of 1.049 wort (35 PPG * 10 lbs. / 5 gallons * 70% brewhouse efficiency = 1.049 OG)."

My torpedo filter came loose in my kettle before I transferred the wort to the fermenter.  That meant a bunch of trud moved to the fermenter.  I had my hops in bags but, murphy's law, ran out of bags and one of the additions, about 1/4 oz went right to the wort.  My fermentation is pretty active so i'm hoping to hit FG quick and move the beer to a secondary to clean it up.  But will that stuff in there during fermentation hurt the beer?  Specially the hops?"

Homebrewing,3d27o5,ItsBrewbert,2,Sun Jul 12 22:49:11 2015 UTC,You may need to replace the poppet in the post.
Homebrewing,3d27o5,VeggieAstronomer,2,Sun Jul 12 23:28:36 2015 UTC,I tightened with an open faced wrench and the keg is for sure 100% sealed with no gas leaking out. It could be the poppets I guess but wouldn't it be leaking without anything attached to the post? I asked a fellow home brewer and he told me not to worry and it's probably the ball lock connector on the picnic tap since it leaked the same way on both kegs.
Homebrewing,3d27o5,bludluzt,2,Mon Jul 13 02:05:58 2015 UTC,The disconnects have internal o-rings as well. Did you replace it as well or just the ones on the posts?   Have you tried a different disconnect with the same picnic tap? If the tap were bad I'd expect it to leak from there and not the post.
Homebrewing,3d27o5,bludluzt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:43:25 2015 UTC,I only replaced it on the posts. I tried it with 2 different kegs and it leaked the same way both times. I'm thinking it's the connector on the picnic tap. It leaks from the connecting point when it's attached to the post. Starts leaking out of the plastic and doesn't leak from the hose connecting point. It's hard to pin point where the issue is since it's my first time kegging and I have no bench mark to go off of since it's all new equipment (to me I got it used on Craigslist minus the tap and disconnects from my LHBS).

Here's the link  http://www.homebrewfinds.com/2010/12/bulk-keg-o-rings-at-mcmaster.html  The one you need is http://www.amazon.com/013-Silicone-O-Ring-Durometer-Width/dp/B000FMWO20/ref=sr_1_1?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1436812489&sr=1-1&keywords=013+oring  or http://www.amazon.com/013-Buna-N-O-Ring-Durometer-Black/dp/B000FMYONC/ref=sr_1_2?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1436812489&sr=1-2&keywords=013+oring  I suggest either buying a replacement O-ring or just replacing the plastic connector itself. The red silicone ones are much better and longer lasting but pricier.  I personally keep bags of each type of O-ring on hand.  Edit: Added links

Homebrewing,3d27o5,mitchard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:00:55 2015 UTC,I'd check the picnic tap.  Those things are crappy at best.  Also make sure your kegs are not over-pressurized.  I think most plastic picnic taps are only good at 8psi or below.  Good luck.  Kegging is great - C02 leaks are not.
