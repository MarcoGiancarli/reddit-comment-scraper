After a month of research and looking through over 10,000 vintage teddy bears on online, I was able to find clues to reconstruct her childhood teddy bear ""Whitey."" Whitey was given to her as a gift during her mother's baby shower for Jess, so he is technically older than she is!  When I began this venture, Whitey was in two pieces (his head ripped off) and missing an ear, his nose, both eyes, and not to mention half of his stuffing was gone. So, I took him to the Secaucus Doll and Teddy Bear Hospital, and after a week, they were able to restore him to his original glory.  This is the video of my beautiful fiancée seeing Whitey again after so many years. If you notice that in the video she thinks it is just a regular teddy bear (hoping there was a Louis bag underneath), and the rest you will just have to watch and see . . """

Snoopy became my saving grace every long, lonely night I spent wide awake, and through every second of my adolescent and teenage angst.  I brought him with me to summer camp, when I went to Israel the summer I turned 15 (El Al airport security wanted to rip him open figuring a 15 year old with a stuffed dog must be smuggling drugs), and all through college.  By then he had pretty much completely dry rotted, but he still sits on my shelf, 45 years later.  You don't really forget a friendship like that."

Tonkinese are a cross between Burmese and Siamese. We rescued him from someone who, let's just say, shouldn't own cats, when he was about 4 years old.  He absolutely lived up to his name-sake; pure unadulterated love. He was happiest when he was on your lap, wrapped around your neck or just with you in some way. I guess he was about 17-18 when he told us he was done with this life, but it didn't make it any easier. I'm a lurker by nature, but wanted this amazing animal catalogued on Reddit somehow for posterity's sake. I don't want him to be forgotten.

And I've also learned a few things so hopefully this helps you.   Invest in a flea comb if you haven't already. While giving the dog a bath with flea shampoo (or dawn dish soap works great also) use the comb to find them. But it is important you wash the face and butt first! Sounds silly but this is where they will run to hide.   Wash all bedding, blankets, really anything that fits in your washer in hot water regularly.   If you have carpet you cannot remove from the home sprinkle in salt; this will kill adult fleas. If you want something that kills them at all life stages petsmart has a few home solutions for fabric. I have used the carpet powder myself, I keep pets out of the room being treated until I'm able to vacuum it up so they are not exposed.   Vacuum daily. Every day after you vacuum replace the bag, or empty the canister, into a sealed ziplock and dispose of immediately.   And don't give up the routine. The fleas that you see are about 20% of the total population."

Awww,3bouik,NagRuTan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:13:32 2015 UTC,I just started treating the yard 2 days ago after I noticed her getting recoated the second i let her out side. I also have most of my throw rugs sitting on my patio with borax dusted on them. Figure I can keep the rugs out there until the inside is flea-free and then I'll vacuum them really well and risk bringing them back in.

Awww,3bn2ww,irishgrey,3,Tue Jun 30 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"It's normal wear and tear. He's part boxer, and they tend to have CCL tears more frequently than others, which is basically the doggy version of our ACLs.  After sessions at the park, he would start limping when we got home. After a couple times of it happening, we took him to the vet and he was diagnosed with a partial CCL tear and by the time we got the surgery scheduled, and they started the surgery, it had fully torn.  Unfortunately he's out of commission for 8 weeks...August 21 will be his 8 week appointment and hopefully a clean bill of health!"
Awww,3bn2ww,irishgrey,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:16:43 2015 UTC,Well I hope he makes a full and speedy recovery. Thanks for that information too
Awww,3bn2ww,JManoclay,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"My dog had this happen three times!! The first time it happened they did the surgery, and a few months after her recovery she was happily sprinting around the yard until she tore the ligament yet again.  The second time was basically a repeat; surgery, recovery, then back to the same happy-dog yard regimen until she came in limping one day having torn her ligament a third time.  Now keep in mind these surgeries are pretty expensive, and the recovery is pretty miserable for the dog and high maintenance.   The third time she tore her ligament we and the doctor decided it was best to simply remove the entire leg! It may sound drastic, but her recovery was faster and she didn't even miss it. She's been a happy three legged sprinter for years now and hasn't had any major health issues since!   Your buddy is adorable, I hope he recovers quickly!

You want to get the kittens with the mother, ideally, but if you grab the kittens alone, the mother has nothing to tether her to the area and you'd probably never see her again. The kittens, however, are going to be in the area for a while with or without her, which gives you a little more wiggle room in catching them.  You can almost certainly get a humane trap from a rescue organization near you. SPCA's, for example, usually carry them."

If she hangs around the workplace after being spayed you could think of ways to make her more comfortable - a shelter, food, etc. if you wish.

Awww,3at8yw,ImCartmansDad,2,Tue Jun 23 11:58:48 2015 UTC,I love how his face is majestic yet his ear is derpy
Awww,3at8yw,__seripha__,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:19:54 2015 UTC,"I think the shelter I got her from rescued her from an abusive owner, that's why her one ear is different :("
Awww,3at8yw,__seripha__,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:30:01 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can give her a lot of love and care now!
Awww,3at8yw,MelissaSayWhaat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"My pointy eared dog can make one ear go derpy and keep the other normal, might just be a pointy ear thing.   Also, I like the irony there. The kill shelter rescued the dog. But without you she would have met the same fate only in a somewhat more humane way. Thanks OP for saving this life."
