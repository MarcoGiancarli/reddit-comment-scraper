Sphere, Eaters of the Dead, The Terminal Man, and The Great Train Robbery are all good.  He also wrote a bunch of novels when he was in Med school, under the name John Lange.  They were recently republished under his own name.  I've read The Venom Business and Easy Go.  They're pretty decent.  All of them have a kind of 1970s pulp fiction feel to them, but I've loved the two I read because you get to see where his talents evolved from.  May I make recommendations?  Christopher Brookmyre, a Glaswegian contemporary crime/mystery writer, Gregory Maguire, writes reimaginings of fairy tales & author of Wicked that went on to be a Broadway play, Preston & Child, an author duo that writes crime and mystery novels and are very good, and then the obvious ones like Pratchett, Gaiman, & GRR Martin.

bookporn,3ce3yr,doubtful-guest,2,Tue Jul 7 05:52:30 2015 UTC,"I wish i could take credit for a lifelong quest to painstakingly build it, it would be much more satisfying.  Although I have always been a huge fan of both Gorey and Bellairs and own all the books in paperback, I started searching for first editions about 6 months ago.   By some miracle, Swann Galleries had this entire collection as an auction lot.  I won it and it ended up being about $1300 all said and done.  If you were to collect it yourself, House With.. is about $400-500 in this condition (signed by Gorey) and the others are anywhere from $50-150 each.  The real problem is finding them in this condition and not ex-library.  There's a current House With.. in comparable condition also signed, right now, from James Cummins for about $500.    Sadly this collection was clearly from a Gorey collector because it's missing several of the non-Gorey illustrated ones (like Figure In The Shadows) so my work is not yet done.   Pretty close though!  Using Bookfinder is your best bet but again you may have to search over a long period of time and request photos back and forth etc to find them in good enough condition."

This is the Limited Editions Club edition of Edward Gibbon's work published in 1946. We have had this book many times before so here is our description: 122180 (Limited Editions Club) Gibbon, Edward. HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.|THE. 7 volumes. (New York, NY): The Limited Editions Club, 1946, small 4to., quarter leather, marbled paper-covered boards, gilt spines, slipcase. lxviii, 345+(1); (viii) 347-738; (viii), 739-1103+(1); (viii), 1105-1480; (viii), 1481-1848; (viii), 1849-2212; (viii), 2213-2537, (3) pages.$ 450.00 Limited to 1500 numbered copies (LEC 174). Illustrated with the etchings of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Table of contents in each volume, with a table for the entire work at the beginning of Volume I. Text edited, with editor's introduction and index, by J.B. Bury. Introductory letter to the reader by Philip Geudalla. Marginal notes throughout text. Includes maps of the Empire, in various stages of its history, on endpapers of each volume. Richard Wendorf notes that Gibbon found Piranesi's ""juxtaposition of the old and the new not only the inspiration for, but also the central thesis of what would become his magnum opus."" See Wendorf, ""Piranesi's Double Ruin"" in Eighteenth Century Studies 34:2 (Winter 2001), 161-180. Two of the volumes are worn along hinges with some loss of leather."

bookporn,391v9d,jollyandy,13,Mon Jun 8 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"that's actually a very critical part of the idea.  Gutenberg not only had letters of many different widths just to achieve the justified margins, he also had many different widths for the spaces between words.  his invention (moveable type, the press, signatures, etc.) remains virtually the same as it was conceived, with all improvements being minorly technical.    not only did he have different widths of the same individual letters, he also maded different versions of the same letter just so that every single 'a' (for example) wouldn't be exactly the same  he wanted some minor variation so that it still felt human.  but it was so perfect, so black, flawless, with no mistakes by the person doing the manuscript (because it wasn't a manuscript), that the initial patrons at the book fair thought he must have made a pact with the devil.  he had a dozen or so for sale, and to do just ONE by hand, so perfectly, would have taken years.  no one understood how the hell he had made so many. and he made a good many more after that.  the colored initials in the photo are actually by hand.  he left spaces for those, and many of the bible were further illuminated (in the margins, etc.)"
bookporn,391v9d,strychnineman,2,Mon Jun 8 21:21:36 2015 UTC,Wow that's amazing.
bookporn,391v9d,abHowitzer,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"So with the variable width letters, he basically implemented a sort of rudimentary kerning? Damn."
bookporn,391v9d,strychnineman,3,Tue Jun 9 08:48:21 2015 UTC,"Not rudimentary. He essentially invented kerning. He basically invented the entire handpress process of moveable type.   I believe the chinese had a similar process using wooden characters for their printing, but the western process of metal moveable type, the press, etc was attributed to Gutenberg   There's more to it, and others did similar work IIRC, but he was sort of out of the gate all at once."
bookporn,391v9d,shiny_hublot,-1,Tue Jun 9 11:20:41 2015 UTC,"The main thing with Gutenberg wasn't really being first at something or the highest quality printer.  Some types of movable type had been around in Europe.  Korea and China had been using metal movable type for a while.  It was about designing not just a printing press, but a very efficient way of printing.  He made a screw press like people had made for thousands of years, but his was a lot better specialized for printing.  His type molds and casting alloy really made making type incredibly cheaper.  Then he made a new ink formula that works well with his lead characters.  He made many small changes that added up changing printing into a very practical business.  The Gutenberg Bible isn't his greatest accomplishment, its the hundreds of printing presses being set up across Europe within the next few decades."
bookporn,391v9d,strychnineman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"exactly.  he coalesced a bunch of extant ideas, and perfected them for the western market.  i knew moveable type was being used a coupe hundred years before him, in the East, but was not aware of it predating him in Europe.  But you are right.  it's not the type, or the Bible he printed (he may have printed an earlier book actually), or the press, or the different combinations of letters to facilitate different spacing, it was the whole thing together.  once the press itself was copied and got out there, it essentially started a revolution."

bookporn,378mom,knighttim,3,Mon May 25 20:07:56 2015 UTC,It looks like someone is a fan of Tolkien.   Also I have no idea how the books are organized.
bookporn,378mom,knighttim,2,Tue May 26 00:56:45 2015 UTC,"Tolkien's works are at the top of my pantheon lol  And with regard to the organization, I'm sure it seems haphazard - but here's a slice of my mind.   They're arranged on tiers of reverence and love, really. The books on top are rare and precious and heirloom type books that my kids will one day be introduced to in hopes that they'll love my books like I have. The top 3 are the LoTR set which I inherited from my dad, and those aged pale, brokenly-bound editions of 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King' came to him from his father. As you see in my post about Foote's 'Civil War' series, I believe it to be one of the great treasuries in American literary history, and so on.   The first shelf contains my other greatest favorites; contained there is a 2nd edition of the LoTR trilogy, new and barely touched, bought for my children as much as anything because I want to preserve those older editions at all costs - and they are already pretty banged up. Also on that shelf are Tolkien's other most significant works - the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Hobbit, etc. There, too, you'll find the works of Homer, Walden by Thoreau, the Journals of Lewis & Clark (also Undaunted Courage - despite the controversy over Ambrose I love that book), the Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss - which, if the final book is as magnificent as the first two, will cement itself as the 2nd-best fantasy ever, behind Tolkien. At least to me. Also featured there are a couple of books I loved as a kid - Rifles for Watie and Sign of the Beaver. As well, you'll find Grizzly Years by Doug Peacock, which has always held a place very near to my heart, and I dearly hope at least one person who's reading this will give it a try if they haven't already. It's the one to the right of 'Undaunted Courage' that's impossible to make out, because the binding is shriveled and wrecked from overuse. Also my favorites among the Norse Sagas...etc  The only thing that doesn't appear but belongs there is my 'Sand County Almanac', which has lived at my parents house for many years because it also belongs to my dad.   2nd shelf is made up of my favorite music-related books,  Some favorite historical volumes, and a couple more favorites from childhood. Also, the Saxon Tales and other works by Bernard Cornwell - he's not the world's greatest writer but that kind of old-time badassery is some of my favorite easy reading lol  On the third shelf, more of my favorite fantasy works and more history and, certainly not to be overlooked, the adventures of George Washington Hayduke volumes 1 and 2 lol"

The 2nd time, it took almost 4 months to get through it because I could only devote a couple hours per night lol  And Foote's contributions to PBS Ken's 'Civil War' were just as much a masterpiece as his full narratives in the books. He had such a unique way of finding humor and brevity to keep the storytelling lively, combined with such a poignant and deeply personal regard for the reverence and the depth of his subject as a whole, as well as the personas wrapped up in the war.   Truly one of the great American masterworks of literature and history"

Criticizing a philosophy book because of its perceived (non)applicability is absurd. Ayn Rand is among the least offensive on that bookshelf in that regard."
bookporn,367hrp,tubesoccer,1 point,Fri May 29 20:27:30 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to the descriptive claims she makes, but there are so many other things to criticize. She dismisses the is/ought problem almost entirely. She dismisses Wittgenstein, one of the most important philosophers of language ever, in a single sentence. Her whole philosphy is angry and self-righteous, having already decided what she wanted to conclude before even conducting her investigation. The falsity of her claims about human nature are only the tip of the iceberg."
bookporn,367hrp,tetsugakusei,2,Fri May 29 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"The argument that Wittgenstein was a glorified linguist is not only a valid philosophical argument, it was entirely Wittgenstein's (and Rand's) point. If that which renders logic possible is the existence of general notions in the mind, that is, the conception of generalized abstractions and the subsequent classification of objects by a common name then, clearly, we are merely playing in the realm of syntactic structure. One of the primary purposes of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus was to show that blindly following logic through a set of propositions can lead to patently absurd conclusions. This is why Wittgenstein was one of the biggest critics of Scientism.  Rand recognized the implication of this deconstructive argument in which not only ethics, but metaphysics as a whole, could thereby be considered essentially arbitrary and thus adopted a stance of objective-pragmatism. If we dive deep enough into the topic, we find that she was basically calling for a nuanced version of utilitarianism with the self set as the objective recipient of ""utils"". Lots of relevant philosophers have arrived at this conclusion and to portray her criticism as a shallow dismissal is, well, dismissive in itself. Most of the people who criticize Rand do so without realizing that they live their lives according to principles she espoused."

bookporn,360r2y,relaxok,3,Fri May 15 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"There are perhaps 10-15 binders in the world who can do this level of design binding and make a living at it.   I wouldn't be surprised if this binding has 200-300 labor hours into it.  There are perhaps another 200 binders with the skill to do this, but it would take them 300-1000 hours just because they dont do that many too become super proficient, especially working with the leather.   This is art guys, done by a very skilled artistian.  Each piece of branch or fox is a small piece of leather that has been hand shaved so thin if you held it up to the light you could almost see through it.   A special knife to do this costs $300 to $1,000, and you would likely need several knives to do different size pieces of leather.   Those tiny branches were probably done with a custom knife no wider than 1/16 of an inch and sharper than any razor blade you will ever own.  The lettering is laid out by hand on papet, then embossed cold onto the leather to create a guide outline.  Each line, arc and curve requires a brass tool that exact size.  So this lettering probably used 20-30 individual tools.   After the first pass, the tools are heated and the entire text image done again.  No mistakes allowed.   There are no do overs.  One mis hit and you start the binding over.   Then a layer of glaire is hand painted on and the entire process starts again as tbe color is added to the text.  Sometimes this step is repeated 4 or 5 times until the color is perfect.  And this is the easy part.    Trust me, paring the leather inlays is incredibly more  difficult than the lettering.  After the leather is thinned, it has to be applied with an adhesive.   After it dries, a heated tool,  maybe 30-40 different ones, is used to set the leather edges together.  If you ran your finger across the leather image, you would think this is one solid piece of leather, not 50, 60 or 100 separate pieces.    I can pare leather down to about .007"" of an inch which is thinner than toilet paper or tissues, but it needs to be down at .00025 or .0003"" for this level of work.  That extra couple thousands of an inch is why these design bindings can command those prices.   If you ever see a binding like this in person you will immediately know you are looking at a work of art.    Source:  I  am a bookbinder.  No I cant do this work or anything even close to it."

bookporn,360r2y,capincus,2,Fri May 15 05:05:32 2015 UTC,"well, the cost of the leather alone is maybe $500-600. it's Morocco for one thing.  that's no Easton Press ""leather"".  and that's all inlaid. the tree is cut out of leather and inlaid (maybe only, but seems less likely given all the tiny branches) into the field.  there are multiple colors there too.  and assuming the thing is properly bound, that's a good chunk of it as well.  the book was almost certainly in crappy condition (the original binding).  rebinding it would restore some amount of value.  but doing an over-the-top (somewhat over the top, actually) binding, instead of simple re-binding, would add even more.  how much more is dependent one whether the collector also collects bindings."
bookporn,360r2y,strychnineman,1 point,Fri May 15 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean a nice rebinding would harm the value, but the actual value of a first printing in perfect original condition (w/ dj) is only around $500. Rebinding it yourself (Chelsea Bindery is Peter Harrington's own bindery) and then charging 8x what it was worth in original condition is an incredibly steep markup.   Edit: actually since it's the US first $500 would be a little steep unless it was absolutely flawless."
bookporn,360r2y,capincus,1 point,Fri May 15 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"yep. just saying.  the price is in the binding.  Harrington is always high, too.  There are a lot of people for whom this is not an expensive book ( I am not one of them), and for whom it'd just be a ""nice"" thing on the shelf.  A binding I have been looking for ever since I first saw it (I didn't have the cash at the time for it) was purchased by someone on a whim at the New York Book Fair, full price, and for the past fifteen years or so has resided as an ""objet d'art"" somewhere in one of her fifty frikkin houses."
bookporn,360r2y,strychnineman,1 point,Fri May 15 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're definitely always overpriced they've also got regular first printings of Fantastic Mr. Fox listed for $1k when you can buy better condition copies for a third of that on eBay. I get paying for a binding, I don't get paying for a binding from a bindery that has only existed since 2000 when you could buy the materials and book for under a grand and still have an extra $3k to hire a binder that's at least as good to whip it up from scratch."
bookporn,360r2y,capincus,1 point,Fri May 15 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"I think PH had a Fine/Fine real first printing recently that was in the same ballpark.  As cheaply as you can usually find some books, especially children's books, a F/F with no sunning/chipping can be really difficult.  There are no F/F genuine firsts of this book available on bookfinder right now for example.  The Grendel copy is VG.  Seems silly but as you know already the price difference between VG and an unblemished Fine or As New can be at least 4x and higher.  I do think they are an overpriced vendor.  Personally though I do use ABAA vendors for any significantly expensive purchase.  I just can't trust a random eBay seller unless it's cheap."
bookporn,360r2y,capincus,1 point,Fri May 15 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"The copy they're asking a grand for right now is very good at best, it has damage to the spine ends and foxing. I agree a fine copy from an ABAA seller would definitely be worth a grand but a non fine definitely isn't. And eBay is ridiculously buyer friendly it doesn't matter if the seller is trustworthy or not because there's no way you wouldn't get your money back if the book wasn't exactly as described."

bookporn,35zw7p,phantomdestiny,1 point,Fri May 15 00:51:52 2015 UTC,Hey! Tried to write my sociology major on positivism. Let's just say I'm very interested in hearing what you think positivism is.
bookporn,35zw7p,kodemage,1 point,Fri May 15 13:07:48 2015 UTC,"The belief in the existence of identifiable social scientific laws. So in international relations, realists and liberals are both positivists, while constructivists are anti/post-positivist."
bookporn,35zw7p,craig_c,2,Fri May 15 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"The wikipedia page was suprisingly well written. I think we must be careful in assigning the positivist label to social scientists, because most do not label themselves as such - and hence it becomes a reduction of their arguments seeming like a straw-man technique.  I studied the positivist dispute in sociology, which was mainly between Adorno and Habermas on one side, and Popper and Hans Albert on the other. Here is the thing though. None of the involved identified as positivist, and it was more a question of if value-freedom was possible in the social sciences. Modern use of ""positivist"", seems to be more of a derogatory term that is not really a good descriptor. Though I'm aching for someone to change my mind on this."
bookporn,35zw7p,Poemi,1 point,Sat May 16 08:30:22 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I've read some Popper, and though he is typically labelled a positivist, IIRC he seemed to be against the notion of discernible laws.  I'm not sure if 'positivist' is pejorative, though. This is only an anecdote, but when I was looking into IR/Security Studies grad programs, the one at University College London was explicitly positivist, the main reason I chose not to go there."
bookporn,35zw7p,sparkletastic,2,Sat May 16 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"Hm. I see it more as it's a distinction that rides on the distinction in philosophy between continental and analytical philosophy. You know; Hegel -> Marx -> Adorno ->Habermas, and then Kant -> Heinrich Rickert -> Max Weber  -> Karl Popper.  Those two systems of philosophy,which underpin much of social theory, are incompatible, down to the systems of meaning they employ. But again, none of them are truly positivistic.  Instead I think we must put positivism back with the logical positivists of the winer circle, which inlcuded amongts others the sociologist Otto Neurath. The thing is - all of these abandoned positivism by the 60's because the philosophical tenents were.... untenable.  What we are left with then, is a label of ""positivism"", to some unsophisticated structuralists, who do not think they need to root their epistemology to their ontology. It's rather sad, I think - and here I'm going into rant mode - that social scientists today generally do not take this route, and that social ontology has been an all but barren field since Schutz.   I don't blame the field, per se, because social scientists have always been more geared towards helping people than doing ""particle physics"", but still, there should have been a better, stronger development in ontological theory the last 50 years."
bookporn,35zw7p,Poemi,1 point,Sat May 16 18:17:39 2015 UTC,hey hey  hey realist are not positivists. Only neo-realists such as Waltz and Mearsheimer are positivists while classical realists such as Carr or Morgenthau are not.

bookporn,35zw7p,fire--starter,-8,Thu May 14 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"Um, no. I'm not partial to STEM. I am partial to courses of study for which there is market demand. There is market demand for about 1% of history majors, and less than that for philosophy. That's not to say that those degrees are completely worthless, because they set you above high school grads, but that's about it.  I did the liberal arts path, and worked in shitty jobs for several years afterward. Then I went back to graduate school for something that employers specifically wanted. Quadrupled my salary, flexible work hours, etc etc.   Not all humanities majors will one day regret their course of study. But a great many of them will. Historically, people who studied the humanities in college did so because their families were independently wealthy and it was an affordable indulgence. That's not to say that the humanities are meaningless. I personally am a big fan. But you can read the classics, learn languages, and study art on your own time and get just as much personal enjoyment. I strongly recommend that people get credentialed in something that benefits them economically. Get a degree in engineering, and you can afford to pursue your love of neo-classical dance in your spare time. Get a degree in dance, and...you can't afford much of anything in your spare time."
bookporn,35zw7p,fire--starter,10,Thu May 14 23:40:18 2015 UTC,"If you got a humanities degree and got shitty jobs, then I'm sorry to hear that.  (Though you said you did a ""liberal arts path"" - if by that you mean you majored in liberal arts - yeah, I can see how that wouldn't be great, because it's very broad; specialization is important.)   I work in the private sector, in a field completely related to my coursework, and I make 6 figures (though I do have 2 master's degrees).  I apologize for the brevity of my earlier post, but I'm tired of people talking about humanities as a dead end.    I'm also tired of hearing about how education is an investment from which one expects a financial reward.  Education is about how (well) you understand the world.  If that doesn't mesh with one's personal level of greed, that's unfortunate, but education is there to help you live a fuller life, and maybe even contribute meaningfully to the infinite conversation; it doesn't promise anything beyond that; not money, and definitely not personal enjoyment (""tortured artist"" is an even more prevalent meme than ""starving artist"").    I'm also tired of people treating money like it's a moral imperative - as though we can (and should) do anything, including turning our back on our passions and interests, with impunity, because $$$; money is a means to an end - a very very simple end, an end that can be met quite easily and with little to no education at all.  Our culture vastly overestimates it, and now our young people are parroting things like ""good luck with that humanities degree, idiot!""  (""If you study sociology, you'll only be able to afford a 5"" smartphone, instead of a 5.5"" one!"")  (Also: you mentioned ""something that employers specifically wanted"" - I guess this is more about studying something broad and shallow like Liberal Arts. There are many fields which look for philosophy majors specifically; same goes for literature.  IDK about the rest.)  (Also: studying engineering and ""reading on the side"" is, as you probably already know, not realistic.  No one has the spare time to actually seek out people who could teach them these books, and attempting to read the canon without a guide is dumb - a good professor is how you understand where to read, and how to read.  And sure, you could find some random guru who has forsaken academia but is overjoyed to walk you through the history of thought, but unfortunately, this is real life, not a movie novel.)  (Also: there are jobs in dance as well - I went to a school with a dance conservatory, and they got jobs, too.  They had to go to a very good (though not expensive) school, and work hard, to be good enough to reach a sustainable level - just as I did.  And most of them don't have glamorous careers - and neither do I.  And there's nothing wrong with that.)  (Also: that's a lot of alsos; it's been a long day, and, at this point, this is about as elegant as it's going to get.)"

bookporn,334f3z,Arrivaderchie,2,Sun Apr 19 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"Aside from being one of my favorite books of all time, I think Steakley has some of the strongest action sequences in any writer I've ever read. For me, he's to fight scenes what Elmore Leonard is to dialogue. Also, Armor gets bonus points for having the goddamned saddest frame story I have ever read in a novel.   I would definitely bump it to the top of the list. I feel like Steakley is vastly underrated. Another good novel of his is Vampire$ Inc., which John Carpenter made a movie out of. His depiction of vampires is fantastic, especially compared to Twilight."

Everything on the right is non-fiction, and are generally split into poetry at the top, exploration on the 2nd and 3rd down, 4th down will also eventually be for more exploration books, then history and philosophy at the bottom.  There's a few limited editions ie Aeneid, Moby Dick, Night Thoughts dispersed around the two shelves; I was getting bored of them being kept inside their solander/clamshell boxes out of view so I figured I might as well use them to fill in the empty space so they're not in any particular order other than being the right size."

bookporn,31f9jh,starlinguk,3,Sat Apr 4 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, buying nicely bound second hand books is much cheaper."
bookporn,31f9jh,emdeemcd,3,Sun Apr 5 10:52:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not judging OP - if he wants just Folio editions that's his business.  I'm just saying it must be expensive to collect such a high-priced item."
bookporn,31f9jh,nobouvin,5,Sun Apr 5 11:50:46 2015 UTC,"Very nice collection. I’ve been a Folio member since 1993. I agree with others that they are not ultimate editions, but they are invariably of good quality and solidly bound. I was excited to finally get a nice, complete edition of the Aubrey/Maturin series, and I see that you have the same."
bookporn,31f9jh,norar19,10,Sat Apr 4 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"I never understood the Folio Club allure. Yes, some of the books are beautifully bound and have amazing illustrations but the vast majority aren't so wonderful. They really seemed like commodities rather than valuable literary works.   I say this with respect and honestly want to know how you feel about this. I worked at an auction house in Philadelphia and we would get lots of these books in."
bookporn,31f9jh,Raykhenberg,23,Sat Apr 4 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"They're for people who want to collect books but can't afford the truly fine-presses like Arion or Barbarian which can run into the thousands, nor want the mundane hardbacks you get in every store.  The mistake I think most people tend to make is thinking Folio is a true fine-press like the aforementioned and expect a Ferrari-equivalent of books. It's more true to associate them as the Mercedes of the book world; the upper middle segment of the market that offers a permanent range that are better quality than most common hardbacks with care taken for both font and paper, whilst still offering the odd limited-edition now and again. I'd say though that the biggest allure they offer is the original and exclusive artwork that Folios feature not found anywhere else.  And they don't publish every book under the sun; they tend to go for classics or books that have proven to be of literary or cultural significance so some may find that a sort of pre-screening, as to whether they think a book is worth their time, an additional benefit.  I'd also say it's apt to compare Folio to a modern equivalent of the Franklin Library and their strategy, except Folio didn't go bust."
bookporn,31f9jh,Lirael,6,Sat Apr 4 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"Well said. I don't expect my Folio Society books to appreciate in value and become true collectors items. That's why I have no problem with actually reading them.  I don't really buy everything they produce, just the books I'm interested in, with the rare venture into unknown territory when there is a good deal or a description that really captures my attention.  Nice collection OP, I've got a shelf dedicated to mine, but nothing compared to what you have."

bookporn,31f9jh,llihpda,2,Thu Apr 9 15:02:15 2015 UTC,"It's a little hard to tell - but do you take all the slipcases off? If so, why?"
bookporn,31f9jh,starsandfrost,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. Initially it was because the entire Aubrey-Maturin set wouldn't fit on one shelf. One single damn book wouldn't fit! So I had to either put that single volume on another shelf thus disrupting the set, or take the slipcases off and have them all together. I opted for the latter, but of course it'd look weird for one set to be slipcaseless, so I took all the slipcases off the other books for conformity's sake.  As it turns out it proved more practical than I had thought; now whenever I take books out I don't have to fiddle about taking the slipcase off and finding a space to put it, and since removing them I've found that I actually like the overall look."
bookporn,31f9jh,falc0nwing,2,Sun Apr 12 14:24:03 2015 UTC,"Great collection. If you haven't already, you should share it with the Folio Society group on LibraryThing.  On a different note, are those Ikea bookcases? And do the shelves seem to be strong enough?"

If you have any association copies of your own I would love to see them or at least hear about them.  From left to right you have two copies of The Memorial of Thomas Ewing of Ohio written by his daughter Ellen Ewing Sherman and inscribed to her son Thomas Ewing Sherman and daughter Minnie Sherman Fitch.   Around the World Submerged by Captain Edward L. Beach inscribed to Navy scientist William E. W. Howe.  The Audubon Guide to Attracting Birds signed by the President of the Audubon society John H.

A  Little Time for Laughter inscribed by Alfred Coppel to Caspar Weinberger who would go on to become The Secretary of State under Reagan it also mentions that Weinberger used to be a reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle and congratulates him on his first job in Washington which I think is really cool.   Purple America inscribed by Rick Moody to the author Max Steele it also comes with a note thanking Steele for a sentence Moody stole from him to write an award winning short story.   And last but not least a biography of H.P. Lovecraft inscribed by the author to L. Sprague de Camp thanking him for the picture used on the cover.

Their writing was an admixture of subtlety, craft and form, and it was read and it was taught and it was ingested and it was passed on. It was a comfortable contrivance, a very slick and careful Word-Culture… one day I pulled a book down and opened it, and there it was…  “The lines rolled easily across the page, there was a flow. Each line had its own energy and was followed by another like it. The very substance of each line gave the page a form, a feeling of something carved into it. And here, at last, was a man who was not afraid of emotion. The humour and the pain were intermixed with a superb simplicity. The beginning of that book was a wild and enormous miracle to me. I had a library card. I checked the book out, took it to my room, climbed into my bed and read it, and I knew long before I had finished that here was a man who had evolved a distinct way of writing. The book was Ask the Dust and the author was John Fante.”   Bukowski"

I've said it before on reddit (after reading it about in /r/books), and I'll say it again: read this version. It's unabridged, firstly, and just as importantly, it is the most readable translation of any book you or I will probably ever read. It's incredible. I can't speak to how much or what, if anything, has been lost from the French, but I can tell you it makes reading a nearly-200 year old, 1300 page unabridged novel a true pleasure.  Highly recommended."

When I started reading again I had just stopped getting high all day and was looking for something to do with that free time. I already loved Palahniuk so I went to /r/books to get recommendations off of that. So then I discovered Vonnegut which really got me back into loving to read. Then Murakami, etc. I know everyone likes to complain that they are circlejerk books but at the same time I think a lot of those books are recommendations for a reason."

Walking into those used bookstores for the first time and not knowing what I was looking for... Buying ""Lorna Doone"" because it was beautifully bound (to uneducated eyes) and being blown away by the story... Adventure! Book collecting is adventure! Cluttered stores bogged down by a tsunami of books, the smell, the endless hours of discovering.    Ha, it doesn't get old or less enjoyable by any means, but there is something special about the beginning. When everything is new, when the whole ""book culture"" is foreign and you're overwhelmed by the whole thing.  You guys know? When the Franklin Library Classics look like wizard tomes, before you start hunting for those ultra specific editions and replacing soft covers with hard.   I love your book collection. It is inspiring to me, makes me want to stop into the local store and pick up a couple new books I've never heard of.   Good luck!"

Can't tell from this angle, but, these like many books, were published with both a regular and ""library"" binding.  If these have the stronger sewn library binding then they are well worth keeping.  If they aren't, then you can expect the bindings to release within the next generation of reading."

bookporn,2svbs7,alyosha_93,2,Sun Jan 18 22:04:49 2015 UTC,Did the bookstore know it was signed?  Or was it just randomly on the shelf and you discovered it yourself?
bookporn,2svbs7,emdeemcd,3,Mon Jan 19 01:54:28 2015 UTC,"the bookstore was able to verify! it's a really strange story actually:  so i'm riding home one night through Tokyo on the same road i've used daily for almost 11 months, and i spot this little store tucked away in a corner that i've never noticed before (found out later it's only open on Saturdays). of course stop in to check it out. the store turns out to specialize in antique children's books, and that's why I notice the Langston Hughes text right away (cause it stood out as not belonging in that collection)  so I open the book and it's signed inside the cover by the dude himself!  naturally start asking the shop clerk how a book by Hughes would end up in a shop like his, given that they specialize in old children's texts, and he told me that the entire personal collection of the Japanese children's book author/illustrator Toshio Kajiyama (the name referenced in Hughes signature) passed into the store's ownership upon his death. Kajiyama had traveled to Harlem in 1964, met Hughes, and it was then that the above message was inscribed in the book.   of course the first thing I thought was is this real? so I actually googled Hughes signature and you can see from this side-by-side comparison that it's pretty clearly authentic.   I then spent the rest of the summer working my ass off to save up for it and bring it back to the US with me. on that note, I'm actually looking for some sort of museum/institution that might be able to take care of the book better than I can right now. if anyone has any ideas/tips in this regard they would be much appreciated!   more pics of the book here"

The father, Alexander, insisted that I had no idea who I was or why I was alive if I didn't read that book. He didn't have many books but it was clear the ones he did have were all in a set with the same yellow binding. He gave me that book as a parting present. I insisted I couldn't take it from him but he got angry until I agreed to take it.   Having read it, I'm afraid it didn't have the revelatory effect my host was hoping for. Perhaps it is because my Russian isn't great and I translated it myself, losing something in the process. I thought it was funny and sad, but I'm not sure it taught me much about myself. Perhaps it is necessary to live in Soviet Russia to love it the way Alexander did."

bookporn,2rf46l,HChimpdenEarwicker,2,Mon Jan 5 17:48:22 2015 UTC,I can never get through any of his work. What's the trick?
bookporn,2rf46l,cptrambo,5,Mon Jan 5 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"Start with the simpler books and work your way into the harder ones if you feel the urge. Inherent Vice, Vineland, and The Crying of Lot 49 are good places to start, and V is the most accessible of his ""major"" works (which I'd say includes V, GR, M&D, and AtD - most critics are fairly dismissive of Vineland (unfairly, I think) and count Inherent Vice as far ""lighter"" than his earlier work. Bleeding Edge is fairly forgettable). In any case, Inherent Vice and Lot 49 are probably the two best starting points, and if you get through those I'd move on to V and/or Vineland, and then the big three in whichever order you'd prefer (I personally think M&D is his best and AtD probably the most difficult to finish since it's so damn long, but I'd probably do GR, M&D, and AtD in that order).  But basically go with the others have said - be patient and take your time. I really think it's worth the effort. I'd also write down new characters as they appear and note the page number - Pynchon loves to introduce characters, drop them, and then pick them up again hundreds of pages later with no reintroduction, which often leaves me scrambling to remember who they are and what minor role they played earlier in the book."
bookporn,2rf46l,Dashtego,3,Mon Jan 5 23:21:45 2015 UTC,I've found that his work will not make sense if you don't finish. And even then it takes another read through and some outside sources. In the end it just takes patience.
bookporn,2rf46l,Jazzex,2,Mon Jan 5 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"Read through a chapter at a time at the very least and read often. He tends to go on tangents into past events, character background, and hypotheticals so if you stop midchapter and pick it back up later you will be lost. Keeping track of all the characters is less tricky with this method also."
bookporn,2rf46l,troubadour76,2,Mon Jan 5 22:02:45 2015 UTC,I just finished Inherent Vice and I'm about to crack Gravity's Rainbow. I'm familiar with his work (loved Crying of Lot 49 and Against the Day) but do you have any suggestions before I tackle GR?
bookporn,2rf46l,NicoleDiver,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:20:54 2015 UTC,"If you read Against the Day, GR should be fine. It's not really more difficult, and it's only about 2/3 the length."
bookporn,2rf46l,Dashtego,2,Tue Jan 6 03:45:15 2015 UTC,I got relatively far in Vineland but never finished. I am about halfway done with Inherent Vice. I got 20 pages into G.R and couldn't do it. I figure I would try some of his lighter stuff and work my way up to G.R. Next is Mason and Dixon. Wish me luck.
bookporn,2rf46l,troubadour76,3,Mon Jan 5 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"Mason and Dixon (at least to me) is just as dense as GR with the added difficulty of being written mostly in old English. It's a chore. I'm not trying to scare you off but if you had problems with GR and Vineland, you'll most likely dislike M&D.  The Crying of Lot 49 is my choice for those wanting an ""accessible"" Pynchon book. It's as tangled as his other stuff but comes in way shorter on the page count."
bookporn,2rf46l,Disasturbator,2,Mon Jan 5 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"Mason & Dixon is my favorite of Pynchon's books, but if you struggled a lot with GR to the point where you didn't enjoy even the first 20 pages it probably isn't worth your time. If anything, it's more difficult because of the more antiquated language used in much of the book. It's certainly not ""old english"" but it's intentionally very dated and can pose an additional challenge to people who haven't encountered that kind of language before. In any event, it's definitely not ""lighter"" than GR at all. I'd finish Inherent Vice, read Lot 49, and then take a crack at V, which is far easier than GR, M&D or AtD (which took me, a really avid Pynchon lover, months to finish both times I read it). I'd probably skip Bleeding Edge altogether at this point, since it really isn't very good."
bookporn,2rf46l,Dashtego,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:12:57 2015 UTC,Im gonna go back and finish Vineland after Inherent Vice. The idea of Mason and Dixon is just hilarious and ingenious to me. But I guess I will find out if I can handle it. Probably will take a while.

bookporn,2r4kca,Buzzwig,1 point,Sat Jan 3 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree with you more! How I wish I could buy more of my books in smaller sizes.  So many English language publishers seem to think that big is better. (Maybe they think that if it takes up more shelf space in the shop you are more likely to see it?)  But I would happily pay a premium for smaller margins, smaller text and thinner paper.  I have a few old 'India paper' Oxford editions and they are a joy, fitting 500 pages into about half an inch thickness.  A modern edition would be about four times as thick.  What language are your books?  I'm envious that you can get so many in pocket size."

Perhaps it somehow generates settings for the other wheels; those only have one ring, so maybe you read from one wheel to another somehow? Very curious.  As an aside, are you sure this is Henri II? Not something to do with Blaise de Vigenère and Henri III?"

However, a lot more time and thought went into this collection. Granted, he basically bought up a ton of folio editions. Prior to the buying the folio society books he had amassed a significant collection over the course of several decades. The collection was made up of most of the standard works of lit, history, and religious writings. However the books themselves were nothing to speak of, many of them even paperback, but each chosen judiciously and actually......wait for it..... read! When he built this library he decided to basically replace his favorite works with more attractive ones, hence the folio editions. Say what you will about folio, they have published many of the great works, so if you are not focused on early or rare editions, or ultra quality traditional book building, then folio seems to fit the bill. That being said, it does give the appearance that someone just bought a bunch of folio editions without much thought or interest in content. I spent some quality time in this library over the holidays, I snapped some pretty poor quality pics of some of the books. I'll post them here if anyone is interested.   Some closer book shots"

bookporn,2lf9f5,zCourge_iDX,3,Thu Nov 6 10:49:11 2014 UTC,"That's what I thought, then I googled it (wiki has a whole article on it), and turns out:   In later centuries the spelling of the name was modernised, ""Shakespear"" becoming popular in the 18th century. It was largely replaced by ""Shakspeare"" from the late 18th through the early 19th century. In the Romantic and Victorian eras the spelling ""Shakspere"", used in the poet's own signature, became more widely adopted in the belief that this was the most authentic version. From the mid-19th to the early 20th century a wide variety of spellings were used for various reasons, although, following the publication of the Cambridge and Globe editions of Shakespeare in the 1860s, ""Shakespeare"" began to gain ascendancy. It later became a habit of writers who believed that someone else wrote the plays to use different spellings when they were referring to the ""real"" playwright and to the man from Stratford upon Avon. With rare exceptions, the spelling is now standardised in English-speaking countries as ""Shakespeare""."

But you know what? It was freeing--very freeing. I didn't lose the knowledge or the memories of the books I'd read. I did lose the ability to look things up in them, but I can get ebooks for most of those books, so it isn't that big of a deal.  I'm really saying this in the wrong sub, but I don't think the fetish of the physical book is all that healthy (if anything I see it as a symbol of naive youth, which is why I stay in this sub--it makes me feel nostalgic and young again). The fact is that the ideas, the emotions, the concepts within those books matter. The actual objects themselves are just bits of paper, ink, and glue."

At the moment though I have a hard time believing that I'd feel the same way. I suppose I do have a sort of fetishistic attitude about physical books but that's only because they're such beautiful and amazing objects (and I do see the tautology in that). Maybe someday I'll be forced to give most of them up, at which point I'll go on without them. But for now I'll happily cling to what I've got."

It was the first Bolano I read (and I've read everything since except for Woes of the True Policeman) and it's still my favorite, even though 2666 is a close second. For me, I like Bolano less as his work gets shorter. I love the big novels more than the short ones, the short one more than the short stories, and the stories more than the poems (which I really don't think are very good). It helps if you've read lots of Latin American literature and poetry, though. I haven't explored much beyond the big names and often found myself missing a lot of Bolano's references."

If you like Cortozar you'll love Bolano. I personally recommend starting with the two long novels, as I think they're his best work. I also take every opportunity I have to recommend Garcia Marquez's Autumn of the Patriarch. It's 5 or 6 extremely long one-sentence paragraphs about this deranged dictator of a fictional Caribbean island and it's full of some of the most memorable imagery in any of his books."

Most people go for 100 Years of Solitude first, which is understandable because it's incredibly good and fairly ubiquitous. Autumn of the Patriarch is also way weirder and more difficult due to its structure. I'd honestly recommend ...Solitude or maybe The General in his Labyrinth, which is about Bolivar, before jumping into Autumn, but either way you should definitely read it eventually.   And thanks!"

It gets its name after Jorge Louis Borges' short story ""The Library of Babel"", but the great poet was actually the editor-in-charge, choosing what, when and how to publish. He took care of the whole collection, except for ONE book: this one, who is a present and a tribute (Borges was totally unaware of it) directly from From Maria Ricci, for Borges' 80th birthday. The cover is simply stunning."

I bought a mower. Running at 3600rpm, the Rotak 40 is lighter and faster than most other mowers on the market today. It comes in a box. Inside the box are 6 white plastic eggs. Each Crappy Plastic Easter Egg TM has 2 parts to it, as if they are cracked in half. The top part of the egg acts like a lid and the bottom part of the egg has a chick inside. The egg is broken - we must fix it. That's not all. We have to ensure that America is a respected world power. Now that’s not to belittle our domestic problems, which are equally important, if not more. Better and more affordable long-term care for the decrepit, control and find a cure for the Harlem shakes epidemic, clean up environmental damage from toxic waste and pollution, improve the quality of primary and secondary education, strengthen laws to crack down on crime and delicious drugs. It's a lot to ask. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of Elvis impersonators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.

All except for The Odyssey, which I actually used quite extensively when writing an essay on the text for university. Looking at it, it doesn't appear to have any damage, but then again I didn't read it cover to cover, I mainly used it for referencing, even if it was quite often over a period of a few days.

My favourite Murakami book is probably Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. It's incredible, and I'd highly recommend it. I thought 1Q84 was good, but Book 3 was largely unnecessary. Definitely not one to start with. Also 'After Dark' is one of my least favourites :P Basically any other is awesome though. I agree, Norwegian Wood is one of his more 'normal' books and yet captures what Murakami is all about. A great place to start."

His insights are incredibly prophetic (Mao IiI in particular) as he is such a keen observer. I had the privilege of meeting him twice and seeing him read from Cosmpolis at the The Steppenwolf Theater (where I also saw his play, Love Lies Bleeding which was so wonderful)."

bookporn,2dbnn4,IAmAchrysanthemumAMA,11,Tue Aug 12 15:12:00 2014 UTC,"Almost all of the books are in Dutch. I focus on the history of the Netherlands and the knowledge of foreign countries (geography and culture). In times these books were printed, travel was only for the very rich and diplomats/soldiers/sailers. Most people rarely went beyond their own region. Books were a means to hear and see about different countries and even different regions in the Netherlands itself! Very interresting to try to place yourself into that time and try to understand how these people thought and felt about their world. This may sound strange, but I use these books as a sort of ""time machine"" into the minds of 17th and 18th centuary Dutch :/"

If there are any favorite anecdotes or engravings from from the books you'd like to share I'd (and probably others) would love to see/hear them!"
bookporn,2dbnn4,IAmAchrysanthemumAMA,6,Tue Aug 12 15:41:49 2014 UTC,"Well, I am on a sort of a quest. I have a book ""Herstelde Leeuw"" (restored lion) wich subject are the political situation and diplomatic relations of the Netherlands in 1650/1651. It was printed in 1654, so it was realy a view of a person who lived and workes in that timeframe itself. But the interresting thing about the book was that on the titlepage, it was mentioned where it was printed and sold: http://imgur.com/L17FXdn The last two sentises mentions that the book was sold on the corner of the ""window ally"" and the ""Apple market"" in Amsterdam. The Raamsteeg (Windowally) still excists, but I couldnt find the Applemarket. But after some searching I found out it was the place where the Windowally meets a canal in Amsterdam. Because the bookshop was on the corner of the raamsteeg, it had to be the store on the right (where they sell sandwiches nowadays), or the store at the other side of the ally  https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.370284,4.889091,3a,75y,252h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s7PF051TyuuDGFaUjoZVM6g!2e0!6m1!1e1 They are both on a corner of it. One of these two places must be the old bookshop were they made and sold the book.  My brother lives in Amsterdam, not too far from the Windowally, so one day I will take the book with me and try to find out wich of the two places was the bookstore, so I can bring the book ""back home, where it's life started"" for a moment :)"

bookporn,2d4m8q,HiddenKrypt,8,Sun Aug 10 15:46:05 2014 UTC,"Meh, don't congratulate Hitler too much.  It was one of the worst economic times in German history, and anti-Semitism, in Aryan countries, at that time, was as popular with certain portions of the society as climate change denial is now.  A lot of people made a lot of money off Hitler; and many of them were American.  Hitler is no more a Napoleon than was G.W.B: he just had all the right friends."
bookporn,2d4m8q,freedom6,2,Sun Aug 10 17:08:45 2014 UTC,"It was one of the worst economic times in German history   Are you referring to before or after Hitler rose to power?   When Hitler came to power, Germany was hopelessly broke. The Treaty of Versailles had imposed crushing reparations on the German people, demanding that Germans repay every nation’s costs of the war. These costs totaled three times the value of all the property in Germany. On top of this came a global depression.    Hitler completely turned around the economic disaster of his time by gaining control of the privately operated Reichsbank bank (What would be the equivalent of the US Federal reserve today), and putting it under strict government regulation and then creating a new debt-less currency called Labor Treasury Certificates. Within a few years, Germany had a solid, stable currency, with no debt, and no inflation.  Within five years, Germany went from the poorest nation in Europe to the richest.  This economic miracle actually had a lot to do with what caused WW2.   There's actually a great film that touches on this subject which you might find interesting = All Wars are Bankers Wars"
bookporn,2d4m8q,freedom6,2,Mon Aug 11 17:31:08 2014 UTC,"Yes I was aware. I was aware of the dire economic times which preceeded his rise, and then the boon to the economy that his administration was; I don't give Hitler any credit personally for the economic positions of his administration however.   And the principal allies of the new German state bank were American: IBM, GM, Ford, Alcoa, Du Pont and Standard Oil. Like in modern wars, these corps profited more from the wars than any other, and it is easy to hold them reprehensible for Hitler's institution as a leader who would apply friendly economic policies to these American businesses."

Heck, I'm probably wrong about the top two.  ᛡ -- unshakeable faith in Nazi philosophy  ᛉ -- life, birth"
bookporn,2d4m8q,lankira,2,Sun Aug 10 17:44:55 2014 UTC,"You're right about the top two. The one in the bottom right appears as though it could be a version of Ka (also known as Kaunan), modified from the 450-550 AD version. The meaning of Kaunan from a historical perspective is debatable between ""ulcer"" and ""torch"". Though, in modern rune-reading (think tarot), its Elder Futhark counterpart means ""opening"".  The bottom-left rune appears to be an accidentally mirrored version of Laf, which was taken by Guido von List (creator of the Nazi Armanen runic alphabet) from the Younger Futhark logr or Laguz/Lagu, which meant ""liquid"" (Younger Futhark), ""lake""(Proto-Germanic), ""ocean, sea"" (Old English), or ""water, waterfall"" (Old Norse).  Though, considering haglaz/hagalaz/hagall means ""hail"" (as in the precipitation) in its original usage, and for the Armanen runes, von List decided it would mean faith in nazi philosophy, I doubt the original meanings matter much when discussing the Nazi-related symbolism. However, they could also be used in place of common sounds or letters, which could mean that they were used as initials for the person or people who commissioned the cover.  You'll also notice that there is a lot of use of the oak leaf and acorn symbolism here. Oak, even in Germany, has long been a symbol of strength and endurance.  Sources: Years of off-and-on study of Elder Futhark and a dash of wikipedia.   PS: I'm sorry to respond to a month-old comment, but I'm studying runes right now and can't help myself."

bookporn,2cv6sh,xlitawit,4,Thu Aug 7 11:36:59 2014 UTC,"The same height :-) to be honest, the ones on top are mostly my ""b-list-books"". I had to place some of my normal books (f.e. my old card magic books) on top, because, even though I added the 6th shelf only yesterday, I had no more room to put them together in one place in the shelfs. So I put them in a visually pleasing way on top, and to make it symmetrical I added some stacks of b-list-books."

bookporn,2c1ggx,CDRCRDS,1 point,Tue Jul 29 13:21:08 2014 UTC,"I love this novel, having stumbled across it in a used bookstore some 20 years ago, having read it expecting not much more than stilted prose and shootouts, and having returned to it again and again since that first reading.  It's written in the first person, kind of like a memoir, by an old woman describing a youthful adventure. And what an adventure! Shootouts are the least of it.  Mattie Ross, the adolescent girl, is stingy, opinionated, unsentimental, and as tough as John Wayne, if not as big and strong. She conforms to Northrop Frye's concept of the ""ironic"" hero -- too naive to understand the things she's dealing with, like Voltaire's ""Candide."" When her ability to keep up during the pursuit of some outlaws is questioned, she answers defiantly, ""Pappa took me on a coon hunt once."" Camping overnight with the two lawmen, she registers a succinct complaint, ""One of the officers made a wet snoring sound. It was disgusting.""  But the prose is delirious throughout, like the events they describe. There's a laugh on almost every page, far too many to give examples. I should mention too that the prose is historically and regionally accurate. About a bucket of milk, Matty says, ""It looks like bluejohn to me."" I looked up ""bluejohn"" in the Dictionary of American Regional English, and there it was, an old term used in and around Arkansas for skim milk. Likewise, kerosene becomes coal oil. Tall scrubby weeds are a ""brake."" And all of these regionalisms are woven into a prose style that is memorably idiosyncratic and unintentionally funny as all get out! Rooster Cogburn intends to shoot an unsuspecting man in the back because, ""It will give them to know our intentions is serious."" Now that's a sentence to savor. First of all, there is the absurdity of the plan. Cogburn, instead of calling out and telling him that he's serious, is going to kill him just to be sure he and his friends know it. Second, there is the absence of contractions, as if the narrator is determined not to lapse into a casual style. And there is the attempt at elegance of expression -- ""give them to know,"" and ""our intentions [not just ""we""]"" are not to be taken lightly. And then there is the telling mixture of a plural noun (""intentions"") with a single verb (""is""). The effect is disjointed. It's like hearing a rapper throw in an allusion to Thomas Aquinas.  I haven't read any other works by Charles Portis. I haven't gone out of my way to avoid them but I haven't sought them out either because I can't believe they could possibly match the humor, irony, character, and suspense of True Grit."
bookporn,2buoa8,ThisIsMyAngryFace,27,Sun Jul 27 11:24:02 2014 UTC,"I'm going to have to put in another vote for House of Leaves. Yes, it is a difficult read, but not in the same way that something like Infinite Jest or Ulysses is hard to read. HoL is an absolute masterpiece, and I'm only sort of exaggerating. The way Danielewski used the form of the novel to convey the story and the message and horror hidden in the story is a feat in and of itself. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, but have never really been able to get into horror as a book genre, however HoL is a strong exception. The book is horrifying, and in ways you wouldn't expect when you first start. This is one of my all time favorite books, and one that I think everyone should read at least once. Do it!"
bookporn,2buoa8,bencertainty,5,Sun Jul 27 14:37:02 2014 UTC,"Ditto this.

People tend to think that his writing style is pretentious for not using quotations and for using words that are meaningless to the reader. If you can get past this, you have a gem of a book on your hands that will leave you emotionally wrecked and re-thinking the ending days after you've finished it.   I started House of Leaves again (for the third time) after I finished Blood Meridian and I stopped around page 60. Last time I read it I got to around page 120 before stopping. It really is a marathon to read and I hear that it's rewarding to finish, I just might not be one of those who will finish it..."

That said, it's equally filled with moments of lucid, beautiful writing.  All the Pretty Horses was my first encounter with him.  Said lucid moments were aplenty there too.  House of Leaves is my go-to gift for friends on holidays.  It's a great escape from the normal read, but towards the end it came off as though the author was trying to multiply himself through characters for a circle jerk of his style.    Vonnegut is a great quick read and you've picked up my two favorites by him.  Regarding Steinbeck, shoo, he my boy.  Mice and Men makes for a great and depressing afternoon front-porch read.

bookporn,29pje7,pickupthrowdown,4,Thu Jul 3 03:02:59 2014 UTC,"Ugh, let me tell you the story of why I can't stand Michio Kaku… Years ago,  he was peddling signed copies of his book on his website,  and I eagerly jumped at the opportunity. I dropped $50 for a soft cover, and waited for my priceless piece of physics memoribilia to arrive. When it finally did,  I carefully opened it up,  only to have my excitement dashed. It was autographed allright, but the autograph wasn't on the book but on a sticker. The sticker was even marked with the logo of a publisher,  and not the publisher of the book I bought. Apparently,  he signed a bunch of these stickers and when someone paid $50 for his book,  an employee just stuck it on whatever book they ordered.   After that,  I was done with all things Michio Kaku. The guy isn't even a real physicist,  just an educated celebrity who makes up ridiculous claims about the future.   In contrast,  later I received another book from a real physicist,  Dr Dave Goldberg,  who teaches physics at a university in Pennsylvania. He specializes in gravitational lensing,  and has written 2 books. His latest one,  Universe in the Rearview Mirror,  actually mentions me in the acknowledgements,  and he sent me a personally signed copy with a nice message inside. That book is displayed prominently on an ornate stand on my bookshelf. The Kaku book is just stuffed in with the other physics books."
bookporn,29pje7,Gnaget,2,Thu Jul 3 14:31:13 2014 UTC,"I'm so sorry that happened to you, what a truly awful thing to experience. Kaku actually came to my University last spring to speak at a seminar; the auditorium was stuffed to capacity, all of the people attending were incredibly rude, and I wasn't able to see Kaku throughout the entire seminar, I was only able to hear him. However, it made it all worth while when he offered to sign books and take pictures after the seminar, and that's how I came across mine.   I can see why you would have such negative feelings towards Michio Kaku, but I honestly think you should give him another try; part of the reason why he's achieved celebrity status is because he writes books that are not only educational, but easily accessible to the laymen. I think his works and contributions to the field of theoretical physics definitely deserve merit, and  you might find more luck reading one of his other works.  With that being said, you have piqued my interest in learning more about Dr. Dave Goldberg. The books you've mentioned sound incredibly appealing to me, and I will definitely be adding them to my list of to-read books!"
bookporn,29pje7,Gnaget,0,Thu Jul 3 16:38:29 2014 UTC,"Dr Goldberg is fantastic.  He is very active on Facebook, and solicits questions to answer on his blog and io9 column.  That is how I ended up getting an acknowledgement in his book.  I had asked a question on Facebook, and in response he sent me a preview of one of his chapters.  I gave him some notes, and he was gracious enough to immortalize my name in print.  His books are also very accessible to the layman.  Another author you might be interested in is Brian Cox, who you might know from his short run documentary series ""Wonders of the Universe"".  Another true physicist who works at the LHC.  His book, ""Why does E=mc2 and why should I care"" explains relativity so succinctly, using no more advanced math than the Pythagorean theorem (a2+b2=c2)."

bookporn,29k1ve,postertext,9,Tue Jul 1 12:08:41 2014 UTC,"They're called fore-edge paintings and are several times as awesome in person. While some are visible as-is, many must be revealed by having their pages fanned one way or another (as shown in the picture). Some books even have a different scene depending on which way the pages are fanned.  The hidden ones are painted exactly as you'd expect: by holding the pages down in a fanned state while painting.  Usually this sort of thing would be done by a publisher or binder (rather than an author), and many times it would be done at the request of the owner of the book. In this time, the majority of books were not bound in fancy binding, and only the rich could afford such things. To add extra opulence, the rich would ask for these fore-edge paintings to be added either at the discretion of the binder/publisher, or with a specific scene, perhaps relevant to the subject material of the book. In other cases, booksellers and/or publishers/binders would commission the paintings in order to drive up the price/value of the book to make more money on it.  I highly recommend finding one in real life, as they, like all old books, are something to behold."

Gen. Gerald Macomb, then the commander of the U.S. Army, though better known for his actions in the War of 1812; the inscription is dated May 26th, 1836. It measures 4-3/4 by 7-5/16 inches, 236 pages.  Despite the fancy embossed covers, this is actually a pretty cheaply-made book, indifferently printed on somewhat cheap pulp paper.

In '67, when the book was produced, it was maybe viewed as a bit of a grey area, depending on how one chose to interpret the charter-and supposing anyone actually cared. Come '73, the Agency was being implicated in the press of involvement in the Watergate break-ins (which would have been emphatically and unquestionably bad), and they did a big internal damage-control audit to identify exactly what all they'd done over the years that might have been construed as exceeding the strictly-overseas-only limits of their charter. The resulting series of reports identified rather a lot, of varying degrees of objectionableness, including the production and publication of this book, which is not particularly damning when compared to, say, illegal wiretapping and systematic monitoring of domestic antiwar dissidents. Reading the Family Jewels reports, it seems part of the objection might have been more the fact that the CIA printed the book, than anything else. (Relevant excerpt here: http://imgur.com/oo95OXu )"

bookporn,26k352,tattoo_love,3,Tue May 27 02:48:39 2014 UTC,"Overall the Alan Lee editions are my favorite, he perfectly captures the tone of the books in my opinion. I also really like the cover art on the first paperback editions, it's very different from all the others. I don't much care for the 50th anniversary covers (the black box set), they look like screenshots from what a Lord of the Rings soap opera might look like."
bookporn,26k352,pistonhonda,1 point,Tue May 27 03:06:33 2014 UTC,"I agree with you about the Alan Lee. I loved the hardcover editions of about 10/15 years ago with Tolkien's own art on the covers. I also buy older editions when I come across then, although your collection puts me to shame!"

bookporn,26k352,_johonas,1 point,Tue May 27 12:42:01 2014 UTC,What do you recommend as his best non-LOTR work?
bookporn,26k352,pennsyltuckymadman,0,Tue May 27 14:14:16 2014 UTC,"They're all very similar, and you can read each of them in 2/3 sittings. I would suggest the book now published as ""Tales from the Perilous Realm"" as it contains all of the fantasy ones, and an excellent essay on Faerie Stories as well. Smith of Wooten Major is my favorite. I just think all tolkien fans should read these, as you eventually realize that what YOU have been getting out of LoTR wasn't necessarily what Tolkien intended. To him, it was something a bit different, and reading the non-LOTR stuff gives you a better perspective on what exactly he was into and how he saw his stories."
bookporn,26k352,CaptainGibb,1 point,Wed May 28 07:33:51 2014 UTC,Could you please elaborate on the last part ?
bookporn,26k352,lvlierop,3,Wed May 28 09:18:34 2014 UTC,"Sure, bear with me here, we may take the long way.   first thing is to learn about Tolkien's actual career as a philologist and linguist and the work he did on Beowulf. He was also acutely aware of the Norse Edda and pulls a lot of names in LoTR from there. So, suffice to say, dude knows a lot of about ancient epics, their narrative forms, methodologies, linguistics, etc.   Second thing is to read his hugely important essay ""On Faerie Stories"" in which he really spells out what his concept of ""Faerie"" is, and his interest in it. Then read all his non-LoTR short stories, all of which are exercises in ""Faerie Story"" for him.   These 2 things, epics and faerie stories, comprise the basic 2 elements going on in LoTR.   He is basically creating something that is exactly what he would love to find as a scholar - and ancient epic, like beowulf, with faerie story elements as well.   So, his non-LoTR stories are primarily concerned with the Faerie elements, and reading those informs the faerie half of the recipe significantly. This is the more subtle aspect of LoTR. Every fan reads these books and talks about the world, the history, the language, the shear immersion into this world, BUT nobody can ever quite pinpoint everything they feel when reading, there's always something you can't convey to others. Reading his essay on faerie and his early non-Lotr stories informs upon this topic, and will help you to pinpoint some elements that you have loved, even though they are elusive and hard to pin down. I would also say that his essay on faerie stories couples extremely well with Leaf by Niggle, which is by far the most allegorical of his short stories - he's writing about himself trying to write this stuff.   Reading his scholary works on Beowulf, the Norse edda, informs the other half of the recipe - the epic.    To me, both are important, the epic is the more 'out-front' in the story. It's obvious, it drives the tale, it is the plot that is in your face, it's Frodo walking a ring to Mordor. We're also just way more accustomed to epic narratives at this point in society, so it's easier for us to identify with these parts of the story because they are familiar. The faerie element is more subtle, and drives a lot of the things that are 'felt' in the book but difficult to talk about with any precision afterwards. Reading his short stories really helps to flesh out this idea of a faerie story by removing the epic aspect altogether.   Anyways, if you like Tolkien, you should read all his works. You won't be disappointed.   TL/DR: LoTR is .5 epic narrative and .5 ""faerie story"". His short stories are faerie-stories, and so are informative to that half of the recipe for LoTR by comparison, and thanks to his essay On Faery Stories."

Also missing are other great books that aren't bios like the Making of the President series or Nixonland (they're on other shelves.).

At the time (which was back in 2005, I think), I was one of the bidders, looking to buy it on behalf of the publishing company I worked for. There were no other copies available (or at least none that we could find), and I went up to $1000 (the highest I was cleared to spend) before bowing out. A few months later, I saw two come up on bookfinder, both at around $35, and picked up the spare for myself.   At any rate, value is all about timing, I guess, because on that particular day there were at least three people ready and willing to shell out $1000+ for the book. I've looked a few times since then, but the highest I've seen it listed for was $100 (though I don't know if anyone bought it for that price...)."

Looking up this version on the internet (of which only one retailer seems to be selling), the Companion Books edition of George Long's translation was published in 1901 and is going for around $50. I got it for $25, which is cool, but what I'm wondering is if the one I have is actually over a century old? That would be really amazing.

Georges Dumezil was a really interesting early interpreter of IE culture and also something of a fascist... since you're into nazi/occult stuff you would probably enjoy The Destiny of the Warrior.  My favorite book about prehistoric/ancient Europe, one I cannot recommend highly enough, is Barry Cunliffe's Europe Between the Oceans: 9,000 BC - 1,000 AD.

I tend to treat reddit like it's a carousel slide projector sometimes.   Just thought that telling tales of personal woe to strangers is impolite.   But I can tell you the downside too, if you're interested. For most of my life, as a bookseller, I've subjected myself to some crushing, Dickens-style poverty. Not complaining, though, because it's a normal condition of life in the used-book business. It's the price you pay, and you do so happily. In exchange you get to be blissed out at 'work' all the time.   [Later edit: my cousin just visited from the States and explained it all to me. He said that the expression, ""I'm jealous"" is just the way people back home talk to each other online. That was news to me. Every time someone mentioned jealousy here, I felt odd. That's why I wrote those little 'but wait, nobody knows the trouble I seen' comments.]"

bookporn,22zzta,Csongli,4,Mon Apr 14 12:47:38 2014 UTC,"Looks great, I wish I had so many books on philosophy...  Out of curiosity, what are you beliefs?I can realize you're a christian, but I saw that you read much form Sartre and other atheist philosophers.Did they shape you belief in God?"
bookporn,22zzta,SaturatedPhats,2,Mon Apr 14 17:12:46 2014 UTC,"I'm not Christian, but it is one of my academic specialities because of the way I grew up. Personally I'm a Traditionalist from the Perennial Philosophy school of thought, and I also practice Buddhism, though less so as a religion on to the more practical ethics of how to behave and interact with other living beings. I was raised in an über conservative Christian family on my dad's side, and a bunch of drug addicted spiritualists on my stripper-whore mother's side of the family, and I went to nothing but Christian schools, so religion has always been a central interest of mine. Sartre is a speciality of mine, as well as the über atheist Friedrich Nietzsche. I love Nietzsche, I have a tattoo of him, but he actually influences my own religious ideas very little.   I think probably more than any other single person(s) so far, Aristotle and Kant have stuck with me about the idea of ""God"". Pretty much, Aristotle spoke of ""The Unmoved Mover"" as his idea of God. He stated that everything has to come from something, (e.g. God created the world, but then who created God to create the world?) and that if you go back far enough, the initial push of energy that started it all (the Big Bang, perhaps, for a realistic example) must be ""God"", who is the Unmoved Mover, the creator than need not be created because he always has been. ""He"" in the sense that it's easier to put a pronoun to the name rather than try to explain that the idea of God doesn't have to be the image we know of the Abrahamic God of the Christian, Jewish and Islamic faiths. This is an incredibly simplistic explanation of what he said and believed, and I hardly do it justice, but you get the idea. If I remember right this Unmoved Mover idea is even where the idea of the Big Bang came from, a priest thought of it first like a thousand years ago before it was brought back into modern thought to be popularized in the early 1900s.  Then Kant pretty much said that when it comes to God, nothing matters but your relationship with him. Don't listen to what your pastor tells you, don't listen to what you have been told the Bible tells you, don't listen to what other random people tell you, the most important thing is that you think for yourself, understand things in your own way, and believe in what is right for you. Does it matter what your idea of ""God"" is or how it might differ from traditional ideas of God? No. And he was even a devout Christian who got majorly hassled and publications denied because everyone and the Church thought his opinions were sacrilege and un-Christian."

bookporn,22m42l,norar19,3,Wed Apr 9 20:59:25 2014 UTC,"Here's one of my favorite passages from the first volume:    Never mistake yourself to be great, or designed for greatness, because you have visited an indistinct and shadowy hope that something is reserved for you beyond the common lot.  It is easier to aspire than to do deeds.  The very idleness which leaves you leisure to dream of honor is the insurmountable obstacle between you and it.  Those who are fitly furnished for the easy passage from mediocrity and to greatness seldom find time or appetite to indulge that hungry and boisterous importunity for excitement which weaker intellects are prone to display.  That which helps them on to eminence is in itself sufficient to engross the attention of all their powers, and to occupy the aching void.  Greatness never comes upon a man by surprise, and without his exertions or consent; No; it is another sort of Genii who traverse your path suddenly; — it is Poverty which travels like an armed man; it is Contempt which meets you in the corners and highways with a hiss, and Anger which treads you down as with the lightening.  Greatness is a property for which [a]no man gets credit too soon; it must be possessed long before it is acknowledged.  Nor do I think this to be so absolutely rare and unattainable as it is commonly esteemed.  This very hope, and panting after it, which was alluded to, is, in some sort, an earnest of the possibility of success.  God doubtless designed to form minds of different mould, and to create distinctions in intellect; still the extraordinary effects of education attest [the] ‡a‡ capacity of improvement to an indefinite degree.  And this is certain that every man may be higher and better than he is.  It is ‡then‡ not only safe but salutary to make sacrifices and efforts for greatness, while it were madness and perdition to become stationary or retrograde.  —It is very evident that there are two sorts of people in society; one which is capable of making those generalizations, and signal master-pieces of power which flow from ascertain greatness, and the other, which sometimes with more pride and jealous self-respect, confines itself to the task of watching and analyzing those efforts.  It is very observable that the second class is Argus-eyed, and that they are distinguished by an acuteness, which should seem destined for the first but fallen upon the second, to measure and compare, with lilliputian accuracy, the progress, conduct or defects of first minds.  It may be cited as an example of what I affirm, that Newton was often at a loss when the conversation turned upon his own ^ that Shakespeare was indifferent or opposed to the publication of his works, and idly left his books, careless himself, for others, for Britain, or the world to boast of.  It is impossible to make arithmetical computation of mind.  Still this indifference to trifles, and the sensibility to them, trace a very broad line of distinction between the first & second orders.   There is another remarkable trait about great moral or intellectual distinction which arises from the last; — I mean the obscurity in which it sometimes condemns itself to dwell, chiefly from its own self-willed unconcern to the rewards and prosperity which their fellow men have it in their power to bestow.  And I am not sure but that the highest order of greatness, that which abandons earthly consanguinity, and allies itself to immortal minds, is that which exists in obscurity and is least known among mankind.  For, superior intellects are only drawn out into society by the action of those inducements which society holds up to them.  If, therefore, there are any who are above the solicitation of wealth, honor, and influence, and who can laugh even at the love of Fame, ‡that last infirmity of noble minds[,]‡ there will be nothing yet worth offering them, to attract them from their solitudes; they must pass on through their discipline and education of life, unsympathized with, unknown, or perhaps, ignorantly despised.  Thus the archangels pass among us unseen, for, if known, they could not be appreciated, and having faculties and energies which our organ can never measure, it is better that we never meet."

To me, and anyone who's seen the quality of the actual Hemingway books in the store, $20 a pop is absurd. But anyway, they're no longer for sale. They are so valuable to me that I've gone and hidden them already. In plain sight. Think Poe's purloined letter."

They've been sold so I don't know the asking price, but I would think something under 3k.  N.b.: the reason the bindings look a bit different is that most aristocratic book buyers at the time, especially in France, bought a book bound Ina a paper publisher's binding and then took it to their bindery of choice, so that the final product would match the rest of their library."

bookporn,20d09y,annoyingbeggar,6,Thu Mar 13 23:50:30 2014 UTC,Anarchist here. I am insanely jealous of your treasures.
bookporn,20d09y,SweetnessMcGee,3,Fri Mar 14 16:42:38 2014 UTC,"I have a couple more too!  First English editions of The Earth and The History of a Mountain by Élisée Reclus (I'm doing my PhD in human geography so him and Kropotkin are heroes of mine), and a first edition of Equality by Edward Bellamy. I also have an early printing of Trotsky's pamphlet Their Moral and Ours.   I think it's all cost me less than $200 total and it's totally worth preserving them if you can afford to. There are weird nuances to the books that hint at who was actually reading them. For example, The Conquest of Bread is a ""cheaper edition"" and is bound in this weird plastic that is meant to look like cloth binding. Fields, Factories, and Workshops is gilded and has a beautiful embossed cover. That copy also is attributed to ""Prince Kropotkin"" even though he had already denounced his royalty long before it was published.  I sometimes feel weird keeping them but our house has become a sort of radical library among friends where we can loan out copies of a lot of it or have physical copies if someone has trouble reading from a screen. (We also do a weekly bookswap at the university and keep the books here so we have a couple hundred books just sitting around that anyone can take and keep.)  EDIT: and -> at"
bookporn,20d09y,danecarney,2,Fri Mar 14 21:21:01 2014 UTC,"Would you mind me asking what human geography is? I know I could look it up but I'd like to hear about it from you and your perspective as a radical and what you want to ""do with that degree"". I'm a radical myself and I've been considering going to college on a diversity scholarship but I'm still just unsure if it'd be worth it considering how hard it would be to sustain myself and go to school. Thanks!"
bookporn,20d09y,danecarney,2,Fri Mar 14 23:52:24 2014 UTC,"Sure! Kropotkin and Reclus are actually credited with being the first 'modern' human geographers. In fact, Kropotkin's ""What Geography Ought to Be"" is considered a foundational text and is often required reading even in programs that aren't particularly radical. I've posted a longish quote below  Human geography is a really broad field that's hard to define. In short, it's the study of human-environment interaction that is based in the geography literature (as opposed to environmental anthropology or environmental sociology which are based in their respective literatures.) The wikipedia article is okay but I don't think it does a very good job. I can tell you about my dissertation work with the hope that this helps you to understand what is possible.   My work looks at the history of a certain type of agricultural development project as something that functions (not always intentionally) as a means to keep people at environmental risk. Basically, in the name of maintaining racially-defined, masculinist, and homophobic state structures, the country I work in has taken on neoliberal (though I hesitate to use the word because the same language was used prior to the 'neoliberal turn'), capitalist development initiatives. In the process, they have created a physical landscape that they cannot afford to maintain and, due to the nature of the project, cannot be privatized. Since there is really no way to handle the landscape and the proper functioning of it is required for survival in the most populated region, the racist, sexist, masculinist state has, in effect, put most of the population at environmental risk in the name of regime survival. It's important to note that this is specific to the country I'm working in and doesn't scale well because it's dealing with a specific configuration of the state and capitalism. It's more complicated than that, too, but that's kind of a basic summary.  If you want to see some examples of radical human geography 'in action' so to speak, here are my suggestions:   Anything by David Harvey. He is an orthodox Marxist and you can see it in his writing. Anything by Simon Springer. He is an anarchist and writes considerably on the history, theory, and methodology of anarchist geography. He also puts all of his stuff for free on academia.edu and is a really, really great person. Not geography but Paige West's recent book From Modern Production to Imagined Primitive is a really well argued work in political ecology/environmental anthropology (which really has a lot of overlap with human geography, I think our big issue is anthropologist's use of the terms 'space' and 'place' without talking about Harvey, Smith, or Massey.) She uses a neo-Marxist approach to talk about the pervasiveness of neoliberalism in the coffee industry and how things like 'fair trade certification' and 'organic certification' which are ostensibly based in social justice are actually a part of the neoliberal imaginary.   I will also tell you that I don't regret for a second going to school. I dropped out of college after my first year and it took a while for me to go back. When I did I worked a crappy job as the night shift manager at a gas station while I finished my AA. I did really well (graduated with honors) and was able to transfer to a good school and get some money for my BA. I rented a room in a crappy, roach-infested mobile home and lived on about $700 a month (scholarship and loan leftovers) and focused on school. I, again, did really well (summa cum laude, phi beta kappa) and was accepted into a fantastic, radical PhD program where I'm paid enough to live on including my tuition and health insurance to go to school. My summer course may end up only being reading Marx's Capital and talking about it as a group. I've also been exposed to ideas I never would have known before and have been able to bring them into my organizing and activist circles to start discussions about what it is we're actually doing, why we're doing it, and what we really want in life. It's been a fantastic time even if it has also been really stressful.  *  *  Quote from ""What Geography Ought to Be"":   Geography must render, moreover, another far more important service. It must teach us, from our earliest childhood, that we are all brethren, whatever our nationality. In our time of wars, of national self-conceit, of national jealousies and hatreds ably nourished by people who pursue their own egotistic, personal or class interests,geography must be – in so far as the school may do anything to counterbalance hostile influences – a means of dissipating these prejudices and of creating other feelings more worthy of humanity."

It may have been a reprint collection and the reprints were preserved until the originals wore out, but they never did. They probably printed a lot of them for libraries and home collections. Also the copyright on those won't allow them to be posted online for a while (see the hathitrust v authors guild case)   I'll see these types of volumes all the time in preservation where the books are crazy old but untouched. I've been slicing signatures (cutting apart the leaflets in the book left by the publisher which make the book unreadable) from the 1880's!   Great collection! I love National Geographics!"

On a side note it just kills me how we are destroying our own physical history for the sake of what, I don't know.  Concerning the suit in question.   On October 10, 2012, the district court agreed, and granted summary judgment for HathiTrust.  Nicely summing up his ruling, Judge Harold Baer declared that he could not ""imagine a definition of fair use that would not encompass the transformative uses made by"" the HDL.  On October 30, 2013, the appeals court heard oral argument.  We await its decision.   https://www.eff.org/cases/authors-guild-v-hathitrust  Is that what you meant by waiting?

You can't see it but those books are eating themselves alive because of the acid in the paper. In another fifty years turning a page could snap it off of the spine or you'll just break a chunk with your finger tip. Mold, mice, bugs, and disaster are other reasons. The digital copy that you can get of these volumes will last (hopefully) for as long as humankind indulges in technology. It's also cheaper and easier to use and sell digital copies. These are already scanned into a searchable indexed database (albeit not for free, but that's nat geos choice) so why keep them crowding up shelves? A librarians job is to manage a collection and that includes getting rid obsolete or low value items of to add new things. One of the first things they teach you in graduate school: you can't keep everything.   My job would drive you bonkers. I'm chopping up old books to be scanned easier and then recycled (nothing unique or rare but some cool volumes none the less)"

For Scribner's in 1929, on the title page (which he has pictured) it would have said 1929, at the bottom of the title page.  After 1929, on the copyright page it would have a circled A (for a Scribner's first edition).  The copyright page is just telling when it was first printed, like you said, 1929.  (EDIT: The circled A is for Scribner books after 1929, not Sun Also Rises.)  A step further with this book, it has a misprint on the dust jacket, and in the book, might be page 181, down 20 or so lines the word 'stopped' is misspelled 'stoppped'.  For other books, if you search online, search for the book and 'first edition points' or something similar.  Or, go to ABEbooks.com, type in the book, sort by highest price, and you'll generally see the first editions near the top, looking at the descriptions will give you information about what makes the specific book a first edition."

Basically, each station has thread on each end, and you weave the thread to attach it to the previous sheet, then attach the next sheet.

They contain, usually, a short poem/prose/letter/document, forgotten or unpublished, matched with a xilography, a sketch, an incision. Great poets or artists, but also common people, friends and kids have appeared on these ""Libretti"". Bugiani used different kinds of papers and usually this choice is connected with the topic of that ""Libretto""; Bugiani personally collected remainings of papers from various sources.   Many of those ""Librettos"" were still realized in movable type, in old and nowadays disappeared typographies in northern Italy, while others in phototypesetting. The final results are those little ""leaves"" of memory, ink and paper, printed in 500 copies, which were donated by Bugiani to his friends and, generally, to a very limited entourage of people he esteemed.

An annotated version helps to understand some of the more arcane jokes and references, but the book is still extremely funny and comes across as well-written. Cervantes was clearly a very modern man - the targets of his satire evidence that. Dissatisfaction with figures of power and authority, the rich, religious leaders etc. strongly comes across in a way I think readers today will still be able to identify with. The pastiche of tales of chivalry, a vogueish genre at the time, is gentler because Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are, despite and because of their eccentric behaviour, extremely sympathetic and affable characters who do what they think is right, in their own ways. You will be amazed that the story is 400 years old. Though I can't speak for how much translation is responsible for, Don Quixote has certainly withstood the test of time, feeling far more fresh and being much more readable than Chaucer and Shakespeare in my view."

It has a basis weight of 20 pounds, yet bulks 1,000 pages to the inch.  It became popular in particular for the printing of Bibles, which could be made relatively small and light while remaining legible. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica boasted, ""Printed on thin, but strong opaque India paper, each volume but one inch in thickness."" The process was used particularly by the Oxford University Press and its paper suppliers. The name arose because the paper imitated fine papers imported from India.  India paper has also often been used for the printing of die proofs of postage stamps.     Related Picture  image source | about | /u/pgl can reply with 'delete'.

It was also sometimes believed to be an elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and possibly for achieving immortality. For many centuries, it was the most sought-after goal in alchemy. The philosophers' stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, enlightenment, and heavenly bliss.

Waking up at 3 am to join the monks in their prayers is a life-changing experience.   A complete example of the Buddhist scriptures, hand-carved on 80,000 wood blocks, without a single flaw. They would bow after completing each character. It took the monks 16 years to complete.  The climate control system in the 600-year old building is so perfect that when they tried to move some of the wood blocks to an ultra-modern facility, they started rotting almost immediately, and they moved them all back. wiki"

bookporn,1uti7v,autowikibot,2,Fri Jan 10 05:22:07 2014 UTC,What were all the things you did during the temple stay program? Sounds amazing!
bookporn,1uti7v,tymerayay,4,Sun Feb 2 19:34:23 2014 UTC,"It was really great. As a non-Korean, you start with a lesson about temple etiquette, including the proper way to bow, starting in a standing position, down to your knees, forehead to the ground, then back on your feet. Sounds simple, but there is a deep precision involved.   Next comes evening services in the main temple, bowing in front of three large, golden Buddhas, as the monks chant. Incense is burning. Utterly foreign.   A simple, vegetarian dinner, mostly kimchi and broth with some other pickled vegetables, then the night-time playing of the temple bell, which is 10-feet tall and played in shifts by monks with two wooden rods    Then, you share tea with one of the monks and are encouraged to ask questions, whether about Buddhism or the monk's own life. A sort of AmA. Hei-An Sunnim (Sunnim is a title for a monk, like Reverend) stressed the importance of living actively, not waiting for the universe to make you offers, but finding the little steps you can take today. Helping, without being asked.   Bedtime is early, 9ish, and the word ""bed"" should be understood to be figurative. A thin mat on a heated floor. I have back problems and thought it would be impossible, but the heat of the floor was amazing.   3 am, you wake up to do 300 bows. From standing to the floor to back up. 300 times. In total silence. A physical challenge to the strongest body, my mind really did let go after a while. I can't remember ever being so aware of having a body but being separate from it. That awareness is a huge part of transcending that separation.   30 minutes of meditation, cross-legged, back ramrod straight. Excruciating, awakening, enlivening.   Breakfast, simple, again mostly kimchi.   By now the sun has risen, so you are taken on a tour if the temple, including the Tripitaka. I was there in October, and the leaves were beginning to turn. The temple is in a valley, surrounded by hills. It was gorgeous.   Finally, you say farewell. You are released back into the world, seeing it in a different light. I'm not going to claim that it changed my life forever, that I'm a different person now, but the experience honestly did give me a new perspective for interpreting the world around me.   Look into it!"

bookporn,1u05vj,Bookie_Monster,3,Mon Dec 30 08:30:21 2013 UTC,"My knowledge of this style of notation is pretty limited, but if I'm not mistaken, this is an example of a style of neumatic notation that arose around the 11th century, after the development of Gregorian chant in the couple of centuries prior.   From a practical standpoint, there are many ways in which it is...archaic...especially when you put it next to modern staff notation, but it is still used in monasteries and in the hymnals of some churches."
bookporn,1u05vj,OneMoGin,1 point,Thu Jan 2 04:06:45 2014 UTC,"Yes, this type of notation sprung up between the 9th and 13th centuries, becoming fairly standard at that point, if I recall correctly (those classes were some years ago for me). It's quite a readable style for Gregorian chant, but definitely archaic. Imagine trying to read Beethoven's work written out in this style; it would be impossible!  EDIT: That is not to say, of course, that the book itself cannot be 18th century! It looks quite lovely, I might add."

bookporn,1ttuxw,-TaborlinTheGreat-,1 point,Sat Dec 28 03:13:56 2013 UTC,"I've never had a problem with chain bookstores myself, I quite like them.

bookporn,1ttuxw,claxonman2310,1 point,Sat Dec 28 14:21:49 2013 UTC,"I have nothing against chain stores. They have a larger selection than the local stores, but the local stores learn what you really like and can give better suggestions. If I am looking for a new book, I always go to a small store first, get a suggestion, try to buy from them (even if they have to order it) and then go to a chain store if there isn't a way to get it locally."

I've only been to the Goodwill bookstore downtown, Eastlake isn't far so I'll check that out too! Also my mom said the new Goodwill in Lemon Grove has a pretty rockin' book section too!

There's also the Adams Avenue bookstore in South Park, Fifth Avenue Books in Hillcrest, and Bluestocking Books, also in Hillcrest and luckily right across from the Fifth Ave. shop. And there's a Japanese store called the Book Off (two doors down from Mitsuwa, is that Kearny Mesa?) which has a good book selection, even in their dollar section. If you're into games they also have used games, and Japanese imports too.   Try local library book sales, mine has one about every three months and I always walk away with arm loads because they tend to be around five paperbacks for a dollar, and the new Central Library has a used bookstore."

Most importantly, there is a coffee shop right down the road from them called The Living Room, good place to read in my opinion."

bookporn,1ttuxw,kokiril33t,0,Fri Dec 27 23:57:27 2013 UTC,"Got my fiance the Edgar Allen Poe from the same collection for Christmas. It's a bit easier as I live on a small offshore Island here in the UK and the local Waterstones, which is the only first-hand book shop in my town, stocks these. I have been sorely tempted by the Lovecraft, and I have book tokens I received for Christmas, but I already own the Gollancz commemorative editions of Lovecraft, and the Penguin Classics, so it's very hard to justify.  I find it interesting how they frame the HG Wells as 'The War of the Worlds and Other Stories'; The War of the Worlds is not a particularly long novel. What else have they got in there? The Land Ironclads, Empire of the Ants, The New Accelerator and so on?"
bookporn,1ttuxw,tigerraaaaandy,2,Sat Dec 28 01:15:00 2013 UTC,"The HG Wells collection consists of War of the worlds, The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, The First Men on the Moon, The Food of the Gods, and In the Days of the Comet"
bookporn,1ttuxw,OklaJosha,2,Sat Dec 28 01:26:53 2013 UTC,I wonder why they didn't call it 'HG Wells: Selected Works'. I didn't know War of the Worlds had such a comparatively high profile.  Pity to not see any of his Utopian stuff in there.
bookporn,1ttuxw,biblio13,3,Sat Dec 28 01:29:35 2013 UTC,War of the Worlds is by far his most well known story thanks to the original radio telling that had half the world convinced this was actually happening and the modern movie adaptations.
bookporn,1ttuxw,Santabot,14,Sun Dec 29 14:01:02 2013 UTC,I'm glad we all seem to be in agreement about the quality of the Barnes and Noble Collector Editions.  I was afraid I would be exiled by everyone for buying from a big name store.
bookporn,1ttuxw,TerminallyRustled,4,Fri Dec 27 23:07:23 2013 UTC,I've ignored them as I just assumed they were cheap junk -- are they actually high quality?  Does BN have a site that lists them all?
bookporn,1ttuxw,TriniTornado,6,Sat Dec 28 00:57:01 2013 UTC,"I'd say they're the best you can get for the price.  Only $20 each for most of them.  Some feel a bit cheaper than others.  My HG Wells collection has a weird glossy finish, but other than that, I can't really complain.    Here's a list of collectible editions"
bookporn,1ttuxw,likeapatient,1 point,Sat Dec 28 01:20:45 2013 UTC,"If you're interested in just the Leatherbound Classics here is a more concise list that has most of them. I've been collecting these things and there are several that are out of print and no longer show up on their website. I have a problem, I own both versions of the H.G. Wells and Homer books."
bookporn,1ttuxw,CloudyWithRain,1 point,Sat Dec 28 22:05:04 2013 UTC,I enjoyed the Lovecraft collection. The Poe collection is a bit too large to actually read comfortably unless you're lying down or something and should probably have been split in two.
bookporn,1ttuxw,raidenwolff,1 point,Sat Dec 28 11:08:06 2013 UTC,I have Jurassic Park/Lost World and the Chronicles of Narnia from their collection. They are very good quality. I am very happy with them.

bookporn,1ttuxw,LORDPHIL,1 point,Sat Dec 28 18:06:09 2013 UTC,I've heard they aren't the best quality (Composite leather hardcover or something) and have some typos. I have a few and have found some typos in the Hemingway one.   They sure are pretty though.

I mean, how can you actually READ a book like that? It may look alright on your shelf to prove to people that ""you're a reader,"" but if you can't read the book then it's useless.

Like, OK those are some nice books, we've all seen them and could buy them in a heartbeat if we wanted. So if you paid anywhere near the usual price I don't personally consider that a ""haul"" because you just went to a store and bought some books. If you found them at a used shop for $5 or less each, that'd be a haul to me.  Not ripping on your taste or anything just wondering if I'm alone in this since I do most of my book shopping at library sales and clearance racks looking for crazy deals."
bookporn,1ttuxw,weaselbag,1 point,Sat Dec 28 04:37:25 2013 UTC,I just bought the b&n Hemingway leatherbound compilation and $20 was far cheaper than purchasing four books individually.

bookporn,1tp6fv,Xavdidtheshadow,6,Thu Dec 26 02:50:34 2013 UTC,"The movie was... ambitious. Having read the book, it was easy enough to follow along. My friend watching who hadn't read it was totally lost, on the other hand.  The directors decided to jump through the 6 stories unpredictably (which lead to some really cool visual and audible transitions), but made it very hard to follow. They also used the same 12 actors for all of the characters, which was neat. Added a very ""connected"" feel to the film.  Visually, it was gorgeous. Huge budget, lots of good scenery and cgi (for the sonmi stuff). Score was wonderful (and the soundtrack includes the full Cloud Atlas Sextet, which I was super excited about).  As a standalone movie, it was terrible. As an accompaniment to the book, it was pretty cool.   tl;dr: If you've read it, I'd recommend watching it."

One of the most popular and best-selling books of the 16th century, it is considered to be an important work of modern geography, and was published in 24 editions and in numerous languages, including Italian, German, Latin, English, and French. Cosmographia was also the first book about the outside world published in German, and contains numerous detailed maps, portraits of famous figures, images of flora and fauna, mythical creatures, and scenes from daily life around the world, among a wide variety of other subjects.  The woodcuts themselves were executed by numerous notable artists, including Hans Holbein, David Kandel, Hans Rudolf Manuel Deutsch, and several others."

The funny thing with the Relay Bookhouse is that I went there once to buy a book and the attitude she gave both my mother and I was extremely uncalled for. Not sure how I got on her bad side, perhaps all the whispering in Portuguese annoyed her, but it certainly wasn't a reason to treat my mother and I that way. Regardless, they get most of their books from Bethel's public library book sale every summer, so if you want to support the community, you can fill a bag with as many books as you want for only $5. It starts at the end of August and all proceeds go directly to the library. The selection they have is absolutely mind blowing."

bookporn,1t7gqq,I_AM_INTELIGENT,4,Thu Dec 19 05:31:08 2013 UTC,It's a Missal. From Wikipedia: A missal is a liturgical book containing all instructions and texts necessary for the celebration of Mass throughout the year.  The Dominicans are a religious group founded in the 1200s. Also known as O.P. Order of Preachers.
bookporn,1t7gqq,BadkyDrawnGuitar,3,Thu Dec 19 15:55:28 2013 UTC,"The nubs (bosses) prevent cover wear. The book binding was usually at least as expensive as the folia themselves. The other poster got the purpose of the MS itself correct.   I can't tell if the binding is original (probably not), but the size of the book is kind of unusual. The Dominicans were a mendicant (wandering) order like the Franciscans, and that book is much too big to be carried around. However, as there was a Dominican chapter house at Augsburg (see: http://darmc.harvard.edu ), the missal was most likely created for mass there."

bookporn,1szund,philo1618,9,Mon Dec 16 19:07:45 2013 UTC,"I'm not going to be a pretentious shit and pretend like I value books so highly that seeing them damaged physically pains me the way it would to see a human being hurt.   They are (modern) books. They are paper with ink on them, the point is that they are low cost and easily replaced...especially with digital archivists working tirelessly to ensure we have multiple forms of the works available, even some resistant to a possible nuclear holocaust (what kind of self-important pissant species thinks people will want to read its books after it destroyed the planet?)  You can burn them but you can't kill the ideas that made them as they were written, that have come from them once they are read. I do feel like you should only use already damaged books for projects like this simply in the interest of avoiding wastefulness...plus you could have donated that to somebody.   Nonetheless, I wish I had the skill to attempt stuff like this, ""wankery"" though it may seem to the others on the sub, it strikes me as exactly what people are talking about when they refer to ""keeping the classics alive"". We all enjoy books in our own way...if we respect the story and content itself are we really to be scolded for celebrating our feelings, even in willful destruction of our own possessions?"

I mean, if you hate Twain and want to shred and hang his dessicated literary corpse out to dry in the public square, then maybe this makes a sort of twisted sense. But if you have any sort of respect or appreciation of the man or his work, why on earth would you abuse it this way?  This is like saying ""well, I've got a chipper shredder, and I've got a beautiful woman, and too much free time...hey! Why don't I  put the woman in the shredder and mail her one piece at a time to my friends so they can see how beautiful she is!""  Just because you can, doesn't mean you should."

Burn, carving, in someway desecrating, is the equivalent to burning a flag of your nation to the lover of that nation.

bookporn,1szund,EnderDom,6,Mon Dec 16 20:52:52 2013 UTC,Here's yet another take: That's a shameful waste of a damn fine edition. Library of America bindings are incredibly durable. They're printed on acid-free paper. They're also VERY affordable given their overall quality.  If you're gonna waste a book like this (see others -- with whom I agree -- who find it anathema) at least cut up a crappy Barnes and Noble edition and not a LoA one!

I could find really expensive first editions in great shape, or decently priced first editions in horrible shape, but I could never find a copy in good condition for what I thought was a reasonable price.  Finally I found this one for $50, which I thought was a steal, so I snatched it up.  It arrived in the mail and I noticed this inscription inside.  ""H.M. Tilford...With Mother's Love...1903""  The original owner of this book (a gift from his mother) was the former president of Standard Oil.  The same Standard Oil that made John D. Rockefeller possibly the richest man to ever live.  Tilford's wealth didn't approach the fortune Rockefeller made with the company, though he was worth about $300 million when he died, but one of my favorite things about this story is that he appears as a character in one of my favorite movies...There Will Be Blood.

bookporn,1rivwo,BrockN,8,Wed Nov 27 03:52:03 2013 UTC,"I'd wonder, though. Simply having items in alphabetical order isn't efficient enough. Newer and popular items have to be easier to retrieve, most likely retrievable from multiple  locations(those warehouses are huge)"
bookporn,1rivwo,TripCrusader,8,Wed Nov 27 04:08:10 2013 UTC,"The computer knows all, the computer tells all.  Source: I'm a forklift operator (night receiver) in a distribution center (not amazon).

bookporn,1rivwo,akashik,12,Wed Nov 27 04:16:16 2013 UTC,"Apparently Amazon runs on a chaotic storage system, meaning that things are simply shelved in the order they arrive.

At least that's how I understood the description in an article I read recently in Le Monde Diplomatique. The article itself was actually about the horrible working conditions in Amazon warehouses, very strong pressure to work extremely fast, no heating and no air conditioning etc. and attempts to block staff from joining trade unions (!)"
bookporn,1rivwo,sterio,5,Wed Nov 27 09:08:04 2013 UTC,The article itself was actually about the horrible working conditions in Amazon warehouses   So.. basically exactly what I thought when I saw the picture linked.

Most ASRS (Automated Storage & Retrieval Systems, this isn't) as well as book sorting systems use an algorithm that says ""These books are this big, these 3 books fit here and these 17 fit over here.""

bookporn,1rivwo,Shanix,4,Wed Dec 11 02:34:38 2013 UTC,"items are actually organised so as not to be near something too similar. i.e. a copy of the two towers won't be anywhere near a copy of return of the king, so as to make sure the wrong one isn't selected. naturally as a result of this stuff is gonna look pretty disorganised"

bookporn,1rivwo,broken_oar_grotto,1 point,Wed Nov 27 11:13:41 2013 UTC,"Actually yes they are quite disorganized in the traditional library or bookseller sense because Amazon warehouses have random stowage inventories.  Items can go anywhere, all of the same items don't have to be next to each other.  The same author all on one shelf, does't happen. Computers decide where things go based on available space and frequency of pulling the item.     Books are NOT stored in alphabetical order, by subject, by author.  The system isn't purely chaotic as the system tries to put items into the most efficient spots.  Amazon knows the dimensions and weight of every item in it's inventory and the program is a lot like defraging a HD but more complex as it almost NEVER moves items from one location to the next because that costs money."

In this place, books are not treasures or passageways or portals. They're just units, going to who cares where. No connection but a click.

bookporn,1rivwo,DVsKat,8,Wed Nov 27 03:40:47 2013 UTC,"Well, I suppose there's no connection for the people in the warehouse, but there certainly is for many of the customers, including myself!"
bookporn,1rivwo,TheBaconMenace,1 point,Wed Nov 27 04:35:14 2013 UTC,"But there's also no connection between you and the bookstore, a place of dust and story and, well, human beings. Having worked in a new and used bookstore, I have to say that to lose a bookstore is to lose a significant social space. Every choice to click the checkout on Amazon is unintentionally a choice against your local bookstore, and, more, against your neighbor who might work or shop there.  Of course readers will always connect to books. And of course there are plenty of books which frankly don't care where they're bought. But to buy historically great works of literature from a place like Amazon is inauthentic and self-contradictory."
bookporn,1rivwo,DVsKat,3,Wed Nov 27 04:43:44 2013 UTC,"I order books from Amazon that I can't find at my local bookstores (though I might order more if picking up from UPS wasn't such a pain in the ass). I truly enjoy going to local used bookstores, especially, so I do empathize with your point of view.  However, it just isn't practical to be that connected to everything in our lives. I mean, it'd be great to buy eggs from a farmer, cheese from the cheesemaker, printer paper from the pulp & paper mill, etc., but it's extremely impractical. We can't buy everything locally. Life isn't always that romantic. It's a nice thought though, and it's nice to try to live that way as much as you reasonably can, I suppose.   to buy historically great works of literature from a place like Amazon is inauthentic and self-contradictory.   I completely disagree with this statement."
bookporn,1rivwo,TheBaconMenace,0,Wed Nov 27 04:51:42 2013 UTC,"To be honest, many of my friends and I do buy pretty much everything locally, though I'll happily grant that we live in an area which is conducive to that sort of thing. Perhaps yours isn't. Suffice it to say, though, that most people don't actually try very hard--it's just too much of a ""pain in the ass."" Yes, you might have to wait a week instead of two days for that novel you're dying to read, but waiting isn't so bad, and planning out one's life more than a few days in advance is also helpful (not to suggest that you're guilty of those things, obviously, but that this is the kind of thing that keeps Amazon going). As for it not being practical, you didn't have an option ten years ago, and people got along just fine. (I'm not anti-technology, for the record, as a kind of luddite or something, but neither do I think globalized economies are good simply because they're convenient.)  To give more weight to the statement you quoted, I just don't see how one can order a number of great works of literature form Amazon and assume to be actually formed by them. Would Kerouac sell his books through Amazon? Vonnegut? Dostoevsky? Steinbeck? Joyce? Amazon is precisely what these folks are against--a system which removes humans from each other and makes them think it's just impractical to be so connected."
bookporn,1rivwo,DVsKat,7,Wed Nov 27 04:56:40 2013 UTC,"Would Kerouac sell his books through Amazon?    Would Kerouac live in a climate like mine? Would he eat the food that I do? Would he partake in the hobbies that I do? Probably not. Does that mean that I can't be influenced by his works (among others)? Absolutely not. This is irrelevant, in my opinion."
bookporn,1rivwo,TheBaconMenace,-4,Wed Nov 27 05:31:26 2013 UTC,"There's a pretty strong difference, however. Kerouac is likely not against living in a climate like yours, or partaking in hobbies you do, etc. Though if he is, and you're really taken by Kerouac, then one would reasonably say there's a significant disconnect between your ideas and your practices, thus you'd be inauthentic--that's what I'm driving at here. If you don't read world literature, the point is irrelevant, but if you do read world literature, the point stands. Granted, you can be less influenced by such authors, but I think it's pretty fair to say that the general thrust of historically great literature (a huge swath, I know) is not in favor of something like Amazon."

But if you think those authors are fundamentally right about certain things, or that they have deep truths to communicate, and yet you don't pattern your life after them--then what's the point?

bookporn,1qg9wr,getawaytricycle,19,Tue Nov 12 12:50:34 2013 UTC,"Page per page, like in a classic book. Or, I should say what is left of the page.   J. S. decided to cut into and out of what he calls his “favourite book”: The Street of Crocodiles by Bruno Schulz. He ""wrote"" a whole new story by cutting out words and sentences from one page to create his own work.   As Foer began to carve out his story, Visual Editions -- who produced the book together with Foer -- literally got turned down by every printer they approached. Thankfully, they found Die Keure in Belgium (Hooray for my homecountry ;)) who relished the challenge of making a book with a different die-cut on every page.  This is where you can order the book and find more information on it: http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/tree-of-codes"

bookporn,1qd8ov,Quintan,-7,Mon Nov 11 17:07:46 2013 UTC,"First of all the overall look comes off as cheap. It looks like a replica bookshelf blown up to massive proportions, and that is indeed what is is: where is the taste, where is the tact in this? There is no subtlety here, no playing around with shapes, surfaces or colors. The bulding looks clunky, disproportionate and doesn't seem to fit in with the surrounding buildings, or even the street. As another poster wrote, it looks tacky, which is putting it mildly I think. Please don't respond with 'well that's just your opinion' or 'beauty is in the eyes of the beholder' because statements like those are major cop outs, and not even arguments.  Finally, and this is what I think is what makes it truly cringy, are the choice of the books to be represented. If it were up to me, I would not have any specific titles or authors present at all, but since they decided to do this, did they really have to make the safest choices possible? Where are 'American Psycho', 'Naked Lunch', 'Blood Meridian' or 'Lolita', all masterpieces in their own right, and arguably more important to the history of litterature than, say, 'Charlotte's Web'? The titles scream of americentrism to be honest (then again, I am a smug european, and therefore biased I suppose)."
bookporn,1qd8ov,WaxyPadlockJazz,3,Mon Nov 11 20:09:44 2013 UTC,"While it's retained not the most beautiful thing on earth, I think it's still pretty neat. It's definitely unique and noticeable. I think they did a good job for what was probably a budgeted ""cover this ugly garage up"" project.   It's probably functionally useful too. It immediately identifies this building as a library (or at least a garage for a library). While someone on foot would easily be able to read signage, a driver in a busy city, who may be unfamiliar with that area, would benefit from the message.   As for the choice of books to include, I'm going to say that being in middle America, it being American centric isn't that big of a stretch. I'm assuming the library has a children's section they went to show off, thus the inclusion of Charlottes Web. And while the title you listed are undoubtedly beloved and important, I'm sure you or someone else would argue for the ones already there up if they hadn't been included.    But I too would go with untitled books or maybe slimmer volumes with author names only?"
bookporn,1qd8ov,Quintan,-2,Mon Nov 11 23:26:26 2013 UTC,"You are right that it is decent job of covering up a parking garage, but is that all it is covering? It does seem like at least part of the library is behind there as well. Anyway, the idea isn't entirely bad, my gripe is mainly with the execution, but budgeting is also a valid point - we can't all live in buildings designed by people in black turtlenecks."
bookporn,1qd8ov,MinnowActual,2,Tue Nov 12 00:54:54 2013 UTC,"Where are 'American Psycho', 'Naked Lunch', 'Blood Meridian' or 'Lolita',[...]The titles scream of americentrism to be honest...   All of your examples are American, only 50% of the titles on the library are American. You either didn't know that, or willfully overlooked it so you could slag someone's work on the internet.   That's very small of you."

Note the very basic design and the lack of any really ornate letters.  It's amazing how many old writings have survived purely because of this recycling process."

bookporn,1pnejt,YoungRL,3,Fri Nov 1 02:05:26 2013 UTC,"Pretty crazy right? Apparently Leonardo da Vinci was a bit of a perfectionist, which combined with being easily distracted/having many interests, meant he never finished the work. Which was a real pity because he was literally centuries ahead of his time--anatomical discoveries made years later were previously discovered by da Vinci, but the pages were hidden away in some collector's attic. The guide said that if the pages had been published during da Vinci's time, it would have revolutionized medicine as no one had done anatomical drawings with such precision and accuracy--to say nothing of the beauty of the drawings."
bookporn,1pnejt,YawnDogg,3,Fri Nov 1 02:44:30 2013 UTC,"Bonus fact: I was always told that da Vinci wrote in mirror image as a sort of code. Turns out he was left handed, and writing backwards was probably just easier so to not smear ink."

bookporn,1pnejt,CheshireSwift,7,Fri Nov 1 13:53:38 2013 UTC,"That is actually true! By this time in his career, da Vinci was pretty well known, and was able to work with actual corpses. He became a rather expert dissector, from which he based his drawings. I believe the number of bodies dissected number in the dozens. This particular image is iconic, but it is actually based on imagination. There are two major errors in it: (1) the baby is oriented with feet toward the birth canal, whichever today is a birth complication known as ""breech birth."" It does happen, but head first is more common. (2) the uterus is shown as a sorta of solid, spacious shell encasing the fetus, while it is in fact more like a balloon wrapped loosely around the baby. Remarkably though, the way the fetus is curled up is highly accurate."

You know, the ones that only excist in one's dreams. :) When I started to study literature at university, I heard about this Master's degree in Library and Information Science. So, after finishing my degree(s) in literature, I did the Master in Library Science. I went to numerous job-interviews and finally the head librarian of the library I work at now offered me a job to join the Google books-team. Five and a half years later I am still working there, but as a full member of the cataloguing department.   Qualifications to become a cataloguer differ from country to country. For old books especially, it is good to know some book history, how books were made in a particular timeperiod. It could be handy to know Latin, though I myself never studied Latin and I get by. You do learn a lot on the job too. Sometimes being passionate about what you do helps a lot. :)"

bookporn,1pkwbg,sacrebleuser,1 point,Mon Jan 6 22:10:40 2014 UTC,"See, I had a completely different reaction. It's a beautiful artifact. I love how the book looks as an object, but I really had trouble getting through the story. The marginalia read a bit contrived to me, and I also had trouble with the temporality of the conversation. For the scenario Abrams and Dourst set out to work, the book would have had to have been passed back and forth hundreds (thousands?) of times. I don't understand the logic.  With House of Leaves this sort of interweaving of narrative and marginalia made sense because it was understood to be the comments of various editors. I have a harder time conceiving of a situation in which writing long comments back and forth between two people in the same library book would be practical.   I'll also confess I have very little patience for excavating a work like this. I was disappointed; the little 'clues' left by Abrams' publishers before the release of the book (there was a video, reminiscent of The Seventh Seal; an image of one of the inserts) were really exciting to me.  That said, kudos to the authors for introducing the meta-text to a wider audience."

Mit lehrreichen Summarien  über alle Capitul / und ordentlichen Absetzung der Versiculn /  Concordanzen / Chronologen: Auch unterschiedlichen Registern der  Historien und Hauptlehren: Samt Erklärung der fremden Sprachen  Namen / ec. verbessert / und mit einer sehr leselichen   groben Schrifft gezieret:  [GDEE] zu Ehren / und allen Liebhabern der heiligen Gött-  lichen Schrifft zu nutzlichem Gebrauch / jetzt das andere Mahl  also auffgelegt und verfertigt  BAGEL  In Verlegung Emanuel Königs und Söhnen /   M. DC. LXXIII.   The dialect is pretty close to modern German, I could read it down as it is. Here's the bookplate translated into English:   BIBLIA  The  Whole Holy  Scripture  Of the Old and New Testament  Translated into German  By Doctor Martin Luther.  With educational summaries  of all chapters / and orderly intabulation of the verses /  concordances1 / chronologies, also different registers of the  histories and main teachings: Including explanation of the foreign languages  names / etc. improved / and decorated with a very readable  [raw] type2 :  In honor of [GDEE]3 / and all lovers of the holy god-  ly scripture for [beneficial use]4 / Now again  available and finalized in a new edition  BAGEL  Published by Emanual König and Sons  1673   1) concordance: alphabetical list of the principal words in a book  2) raw type: refers to a specific sort of print type that is nowadays often referred to as a ""gothic type"" - See this example  3) Looked like all capital letters, but I'm not sure  4) ""nützlich"" is actually translated as ""useful"", but translating it as ""useful use"" sounded a bit weird to me. The expression ""Zum nützlichen Gebrauch"" itself is not being used anymore, but you would often find it on the bookplates of German books printed until around 1920. The closest translation would be ""For personal perusal"", I guess.  The bookplate and the bible itself is a remarkable piece of both calligraphy and book art. I particularly like the capital letters at the beginning of each chapter. I was also surprised to see that the bible includes the Apokrypha, which is a bit unusual.   [Edit] fixed some typos"

bookporn,1nao1r,karmicviolence,56,Sat Sep 28 05:07:22 2013 UTC,"I'll be ""that guy"". Borders was basically the bookstore equivalent of Blockbuster. They rapidly expanded, put the mom-and-pop/independents out of business, and are now closing down as book sales have moved online. There is no meaningful symbolism here to be found.   Fortunately, there are still small independent bookstores around, which fill a niche for people like us, and now they have less direct competition. Things are fine the way they are."
bookporn,1nao1r,sorry_to_say,12,Sat Sep 28 07:17:45 2013 UTC,"In the town where I grew up there was this AMAZING little book shop that I would walk to and hang out in as a kid.  Then Borders came...  I still went to the small shop (they had cool books, the owners were really nice and didn't care that I hung out for hours, etc.).  One day the small shop was gone.  It was years until the Borders finally closed but it felt nice and justified."
bookporn,1nao1r,trash_talking,18,Sat Sep 28 12:50:25 2013 UTC,"I grew up where Borders began; Ann Arbor, Michigan.  We had something like five Borders stores within city limits, plus like two Barnes and Noble.  We also had about a half dozen independent book stores.  I liked all our independent bookstores; they were great when I wanted an old used brilliantly bound copy of some classic.  But I also really liked Borders.  My friends and I would hang out there almost every day after school; it was like our library.  We would go there to study and read.  It was not uncommon for most of our adventures downtown to start with ""lets meet up at Borders"", where we'd spend the first hour or so of our nights walking around the massive shelves pointing out books saying, ""Have you read that yet?  It's so good.""  I think my point is that Borders had it's value, and in my opinion that is a value that isn't easily replaced.  I'm glad if somehow their absence leaves more room for independents, but honestly I'm not sure if that's the case.  In my hometown, since all five Borders have left, want to know how many bookstores have come in to replace them?  Just one.  I think that Borders dissolving was not a good thing for other bookstores, just like Blockbuster closing down was not a good sign for other film shops.  The industry itself is failing.  I think there will probably always be printed books, but my point is that Borders closing down is not something to be celebrated.  If you love books like I do, I would argue it's quite the opposite."
bookporn,1nao1r,bubblegamy,3,Sat Sep 28 17:33:27 2013 UTC,"My friends and I were pretty heartbroken when the Borders in our mall closed down during high school. It really was a haven to just hang out alone or with friends, flip through some books, and just chill.  I loved the feel of being in there; and even though other bookstores have their charm, it's just not the same."
bookporn,1nao1r,trash_talking,2,Sat Sep 28 23:53:09 2013 UTC,I respect your point of view and I can see where Borders wasn't a total bust.  I guess it just bums me out because the local mom and pop bookstore was a part of my childhood.  I never spend much time in the Borders because there was no where to really hang out except the cafe part.  Barnes and Noble felt more of a hang out and chill for a while kind of place for the two larger chain bookstores.  I do totally enjoy hearing another perspective on this though so thank you!
bookporn,1nao1r,Poemi,14,Mon Sep 30 00:45:21 2013 UTC,"people like us   So even though Borders served millions of people, their demise is just dandy because you're an elitist prick?  Borders, like Blockbuster, ""rapidly expanded"" on the basis of their success--because they offered far better selection than mom-and-pops. They didn't dwindle and die because of some righteous moral principle that they violated--they died because their business models were no longer viable. There are better ways for people to get books and movies, now.  Just like there are better ways to get water than by pulling it up from a well. If you personally prefer to get your water that way, then fine--but you're an insufferable douchebag for suggesting that well water is morally superior, and that you'd be happy if the city water supply stopped delivering water directly into people's houses."
bookporn,1nao1r,miss_jessi,7,Sat Sep 28 23:50:11 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you. As much as I like small, local bookstores, Borders had a huge selection. And a coffee shop in the back so I could drink a latte and sample my book before I purchased it. I mean, there's still Barnes and Noble which is nice, and Books a Million which I have a personal vendetta against but that's beside the point. I miss Borders, but that doesn't mean Mom and Pop stores are completely free either. To each his own, I love 'em both for what each brings to the table.      Except Books a Million."

Thanks for being mature about this. No, I'm not celebrating the demise of Borders, but I'm not going to weep about the evolving business model of book sales either, which is all this represents.   I would reply to the rest of your comment, but it's pretty clear you missed my point. I'm strictly talking about economics, while noting that it's a little silly (because of the history of bookstore economics) to feel ""sorry"" for Borders. That was the implication I intended anyway, but it's easy to see why you interpreted my comment the way you did. I don't disagree with anything you said, because it's plainly true, with exception to the misguided personal attacks. I'm really not the one being a douchebag here."

bookporn,1nao1r,ExParteVis,42,Mon Dec 30 09:14:38 2013 UTC,"Remember that there's a free book store in every town: A library.  When libraries start closing, I will lead a revolution.  A lot of people overlook the important of community libraries. In bigger cities, there are dozens of bookstores. In smaller ones, especially where money for public services is small, libraries are the foundation of their stability. That sounds hyperbolic, doesn't it? But it's true. A lot of people in my hometown don't have access to the internet, and the library gives them that. A lot of them don't have quiet places to study, and kids who would otherwise not be able to finish their homework or read the next chapter of their books in peace would end up falling behind and not finishing school.  People who can't afford books get free books. No charge whatsoever. No charge to open a library account, and what fees there are for over-due books are small (usually 15 cents a day).  But a lot of libraries are underfunded in smaller places. After finally getting out of my hometown, and visiting other communities, I've come to appreciate my local library. For a small library it has an enormous collection of books. Many of them are old, however. The average date for them is probably 40 years old.  Bookstores closing is a tragedy. Libraries closing is worthy of panic."
bookporn,1nao1r,orwellsocietyguy,9,Sat Sep 28 05:22:32 2013 UTC,"I wish more people spoke about this. I live in London where the British Library is situated. I've taken so many people there who are literally blown away by the scale and performance of the place. It's truly comparable to the ISS, CERN or any great monument with it's 8 story cavern of robotically maintained shelving in a nuclear proof bunker - it's shelves stuffed with historical gems of priceless worth and epic history. How many people in London know about this? Not enough. It's footfall is a fraction of the V&A or Science museum. Why because 'it's a library' and 'they're boring'.  It's up to people to get involved in their local library and make it something. You pay for it from your taxes - go get involved and hanker some mates to also come along - even if it's just to hang out there and spend a few coins in the cafe or to steal books from your workplace and donate them.  My local library has a fine selection of beautiful graphic design books - all freshly pinched from my company who can more than afford it. When my boss reprimanded me telling me 'you're probably stealing a book a week' and agreed to donate £500 to the library in order to get me to stop - I replied by saying ""great - I'll start stealing 2 books a week"".  http://www.electronicproducts.com/Sensors_and_Transducers/Sensors/Image_of_the_Day_Inside_the_British_Library_s_new_hi-tech_newspaper_storage_building.aspx"

bookporn,1nao1r,ExParteVis,4,Sat Sep 28 08:39:26 2013 UTC,"Fuck. That.  Trips to the library shouldn't be to get books: They should be to get lost in the mazes of collections. You should go for a specific book and end up reading a completely different book for an hour. You should end up finding someone with your same interests and talking to them about a million different things. There should be impromptu book clubs.  The instant gratification we have become accustomed to should not and cannot make its way into the field of books. I've found so many books that I wouldn't have even thought existed by walking down the wrong aisle. I could've found the book I was looking for on Amazon and downloaded it, but then I wouldn't have found many other, marvelous books that I never knew existed. Your library should be so visited by you that your librarians recommend books they think you'll love.   Libraries aren't where books are stored; they're where books live."
bookporn,1nao1r,guitartablelamp,2,Sat Sep 28 10:17:18 2013 UTC,"I share your lament. I hope there will at least be paper libraries over the few hundred years. Even now I believe many types of film have gone back in production.   But speaking as the devils advocate- books online can be discussed at any conceivable length, at whim with anybody across the globe. Books online are more than ubiquitous, of perpetual stock, and the definition of variety. They are with you at all times, along with the entirety of your collection. They are dirt cheap, and invariably free too. It's only a matter of time before an Internet cafe becomes drastically more affordable than a library.   Their content is what matters in the end, is it not? What will the children of your children think of the books you cherish, moldy, heavy, slow, a relic of the old days.

I'm okay with this.  That said, I'll be honest: I loved my town's Borders. My family went there every Friday night when I was growing up. My mom and my stepdad had Borders dates (so we kids could just play in the children's section). And I bought one of the store's lovely leather armchairs when the store closed (because I am a vulture).

I was the new kid in Elementary school, and didn't know very many people, so I mostly tagged along with my Mom from place to place. One place she'd always take me was this new bookstore that had opened in between a Circuit City and a PC repair shop. I would wander those aisles for days on end, looking at each book title and wondering at the information they held between their thick bindings. Borders was the place where I went to watch Puppet shows and mimes, Borders was where I went to trade and play Pokemon cards, Borders was the place where I developed a taste for Music from all across the world, and Borders was where I first learned to read. Occasionally the store would change, sections would vanish and move, I remember being particularly upset when they removed a set of stage stairs in the children's section. I remember when the Anime/Manga wave descended upon the store and watching its shelves stretch and relocate, dislodging the DVD section. Middle School came and I graduated beyond the confines of the Children and Manga/Graphic Novel section and got my first taste of H.P. Lovecraft, Tolkien, and George R.R. Martin at the suggestion of one of the employees. I remember teacher's appreciation week where i'd often leave with more books than my little arms could carry thanks to my Mom getting full benefit.  High School came, I watched employees come and go; saw Seattle's Best takeover the cafe which used to be filled with local art. Still I continued to move from section to section based on a sudden interest in Physics or Dungeons and Dragons, or Warhammer 40k or New Age medicine or Theodore Roosevelt. Finally I walked in one day, Junior year and I saw a clearance sign out front. I walked up to the Manager who i'd known since his first day as a cashier and asked him what was up. He just looked at me with sad tired and eyes and said ""I don't know, but corporate isn't paying the rent on the building so we're shutting down."" I asked him what now, but all I got was a sad shrug.  It took nearly half a year for Borders to empty out, and even then it wasn't until I left for college that all signs of it had been completely dismantled. In a way it was like I grew up with that store, and its demise was the signal of the end of an era. I'm pretty sure it got replaced with a DSW shoes or something, I haven't been back home in awhile.  Here's one to the comfy chairs in the back Here's one for my first coffee drink and all the bitterness it contained Here's one to Jazz, an amazing employee who I hope is doing well and here's one to the aisles of books, whose carpeted floors i'll never walk aimlessly through again."

I got approximately two paychecks a month and after rent I had $.38 left out of one paycheck. I was also sending my mother money to get by, so I had very little extra money for entertainment. Of course there was the library, and I frequently went there. But Borders was my bigtime entertainment. Usually a couple Fridays a month I would scrounge up about $10 and go to Borders. I collected an armload of books and headed over to the cafe where I would get a little something and browse my books.   Then they brought in the live entertainment - local bands/singers. I always reserved $3 to tip them - not much, but a lot for me! Once a month I didn't get anything to eat so I could actually buy a book!

bookporn,1mdc4i,ferulebezel,2,Sun Sep 15 10:32:48 2013 UTC,"I'm surprised to hear this from someone who glued things into books, rubber stamped the edges and probably taped plastic covers directly onto the jackets."
bookporn,1mdc4i,emkay99,2,Sat Sep 14 20:38:12 2013 UTC,"The property stamps and bar code labels (or card pockets in the old days) don't ""damage"" the book, unless you're a purist or a collector. A public librtary is not a museum.  And if the Plastikleers are taped directly to the book, then some prep clerk was very badly trained. You only tape the protective plastic jacket-sleeve to itself.  Even then, when I was doing archival collection development, the property stamp, etc, went on index cards that were tucked inside the book. (And these books were not kept on an open shelf; they had to be requested and signed for.) But no permanent change was made to the volume itself. This is standard practice.  Cracking the spine, however, will cause signatures or chunks of glued pages to fall out, which makes the book unusable by anyone else. And wastes taxpayers' money, among other things."
bookporn,1mdc4i,sleepykoala69,0,Mon Sep 16 06:25:17 2013 UTC,Not enough people know about this.
bookporn,1mdc4i,strychnineman,3,Mon Sep 16 12:45:10 2013 UTC,"not enough people collect the books to which this pertains.  the bindings to which this refers are few and far between, even then.  this relates solely to hand-bound, sewn leather bindings, ca. 1875-1925.  ...although there are some being bound like this today by dedicated craftsmen and for their patrons."
bookporn,1mdc4i,strychnineman,2,Sat Sep 14 14:12:12 2013 UTC,"It's also that the backs were sewn and rounded.   A modern book is hollow backed and springs open, easily laying flat. This makes the book open easily, but the only thing holding the boards on are the pastedowns. The spine often goes concave on a modern binding, and the boards tears free pretty easily too  The glue then wasn't brittle, because it was new. The back was stiff because the sigs were sewn tightly on cords, the leather would firm and stiffen after gluing, and the backs were heavily rounded."
bookporn,1mdc4i,strychnineman,2,Tue Oct 1 12:55:32 2013 UTC,"To expand on this. Less important even than the glue used, or even the manner in which the signatures are sewn on cords, is the fact that the text was repeatedly beaten over and over with a hammer as it was sewn. This unified the text block and turned it almost literally into a solid block. The text was further pressed under heavy weight.   If you open a finely bound book, ca 1890, the pages are virtually wedded. If edge gilt, the block is so uniform that the edges can be polished.   Which means that the pages stick together.   Read the footnote to the original diagram. The person who broke that binding grabbed the book with a thumb holding each half of the book and opened quickly. The pages would never simply fan open or slide past each other. They would act as two solid blocks, and the only way they could open would be to snap the back.   Matthew's diagram isn't about relaxing the back, it's about breaking the cohesion between pages and allowing them to act independently  This compact block is necessary to bind properly in leather, with gilt edges and to achieve a firm back.   But all that can be undone by openinh a fresh bound book in halves, because the leaves will still be acting as one monolithic block"
bookporn,1mdc4i,strychnineman,2,Sun Oct 6 16:24:29 2013 UTC,"Just a quick clarification:    Glue in a leather binding, sewn on cords, has nothing to do with securing the pages.  It is ONLY for holding the leather.   Further, bone glue wasn't usedat all. It was flour or rice paste. That's it.   It remains soft and flexible for a long time, allowing the nipping up of bands, form the turn ins and turning in at the head band  In fact, if you never glue the leather on the book, and had nothing but boards and the text block (which involved no glue whatsoever) you could still break the back of the book  So.  Explain where glue even enters into it?"

In some cases, those family bibles are the only existing keys for people looking to outline their ancestry. So many old family bibles end up at antique shops or at booksellers, making it harder for genealogists to track them down.

I gave it to my gf since she reads a lot more than me. Her goodreads review was:  ""It seemed as if the author set out to write a Safran Foer-type book, but instead offered a story with jumps in strange places and unconnecting thoughts. Too much detail in some areas (main character), and really not enough detail in the story line. ""  Though, she loves Foer and the Unnamed cover looked to be mimicking his covers. Probably didn't help her be objective."

bookporn,1klj1f,TheMightyBarabajagal,5,Sun Aug 18 18:51:15 2013 UTC,"I agree. There is nothing like a huge leather bound tome on the shelf, or the great feeling of opening such. And there is no way a Kindle or iPad will replace the gorgeous, huge, art books. Print is not dead, and will not die. But it will diminish  to a large extent. Newspapers are already pushing their apps, magazines are pushing virtual versions with multimedia content and the novels will gradually shift there too. Print will be for purists :)"

bookporn,1klj1f,ExParteVis,6,Sun Aug 18 13:01:11 2013 UTC,Slower with the same degree of comprehension or just slower?
bookporn,1klj1f,mdtTheory,2,Sun Aug 18 13:28:35 2013 UTC,Here's a good summary of the studies
bookporn,1klj1f,ExParteVis,16,Sun Aug 18 13:31:04 2013 UTC,"Those are monitor Vs. Hard copy, not kindle Vs. Paper. The kindle is extremely different from a monitor because of its unbacklit e-ink display that much more accurately reproduces paper than a monitor.   This study is as irrelevant to the discussion as a study of shampoo on lab rats."
bookporn,1klj1f,bleedscarlet,12,Sun Aug 18 13:47:02 2013 UTC,"Here's another study related ti the iPad and Kindle, then. It's 10% slower, which isn't that bad if you're reading a short story. However, Moby Dick will take longer."
bookporn,1klj1f,ExParteVis,6,Sun Aug 18 13:52:55 2013 UTC,"Nice, good follow up! This surprised me, the ipad scored better than the kindle! He says it wasn't statistically significant between the kindle and ipad, but the kindle from the books was, although he says the ipad had p=0.06,which isn't very significant.   Still, I'm surprised. Now I'm curious, I would love to see a much larger and multi factorial test."
bookporn,1klj1f,bleedscarlet,10,Sun Aug 18 14:05:02 2013 UTC,"It's a study based off of 24 people and their survey results, so take the test with a grain of salt.  My point is, its results are probably completely negligible compared to what is comfortable, convenient, and pleasureful to you."

bookporn,1klj1f,ferulebezel,1 point,Sun Aug 18 20:19:58 2013 UTC,"As a bookseller I have mixed feelings about this.    Kindles are fine for novels and other things things that are only read sequentially.  They suck for references.  They are really slow to navigate, and you can't have enough links to overcome this.  Their formating options are too limited.  They handle images poorly.  And their character sets are too limited.  They're fine for disposable fiction.  They are more costly.  The 'books' cost about the same amount as a mass market paperback, which can handle three or four careful readings before it is unsellable.  If you buy used and trade in for your next purchase, you can feed a reading habit for about one fourth the kindle price, and that is not counting the cost of the kindle.  There are very few better gifts of a signed first of a book that the recipient especially loves.  Many people like to keep their books as trophies.  A visible book cover is also good for social signaling.  If I see a woman reading something like 'Manipulating Your Man with Astrology' I know to just move on, no matte how hot she is.  On the other hand if real books do become a niche item, the decline in physical quality will be halted and probably reversed.  No perfect binding, half cloth covers, acidic or otherwise shitty paper."

bookporn,1kbo4z,I_Like_Your_Username,11,Wed Aug 14 08:04:02 2013 UTC,"When the SFWPorn Network was created, there were only three subreddits: /r/EarthPorn, /r/SpacePorn and /r/CityPorn. SpacePorn existed as a small (<20 subscribers) personal subreddit of two users who loved sharing breathtaking images of space between themselves. One man happened upon the fledgling subreddit by chance, loved the name, saw the potential, contacted the SpacePorn mods and created EarthPorn and CityPorn. Lo and behold, The SFWPorn Network was born.  The term ""Food Porn"" appears to have been coined by the feminist critic Rosalind Coward in her 1984 book Female Desire in which she writes:   ""Cooking food and presenting it beautifully is an act of servitude. It is a way of expressing affection through a gift... That we should aspire to produce perfectly finished and presented food is a symbol of a willing and enjoyable participation in servicing others. Food pornography exactly sustains these meanings relating to the preparation of food. The kinds of picture used always repress the process of production of a meal. They are always beautifully lit, often touched up.""   The English language is constantly changing and evolving. The SFWPorn Network was hugely successful in the beginning for two reasons: the name sparked controversy, which created buzz, which brought traffic and continued popularity. Secondly, subreddits like /r/earthpics, /r/citypics etc had already existed. It would have been an arduous process to get all the mods on board for such a project, if they were even still active on reddit at all. Much simpler to create brand new subreddits with a new naming scheme and start from scratch.  /r/EarthPorn was made a default subreddit after only two years. We must be doing something right."
bookporn,1kbo4z,Trenchyjj,-1,Wed Aug 14 08:24:49 2013 UTC,"It's nice to read that story about the beginnings of the STWPorn Network, which I did not know about before.  I understand how the phrase ""Food Porn"" being coined by a feminist 30 years ago can be used as a reference for the surname's legitimacy and tactfulness, but the average person doesn't know that, and the information does not readily available on the subreddits.   I understand how the surname may have attributed to the network's success. I'll offer the opinion that perhaps it will get you somewhere faster, but not higher. This is to say that the controversy garnered the network attention, but may not be the most well-suited for long-term expansion.  When I mentioned to a friend the context of post (I forget which now) in a community to share maps, /r/MapPorn, I attest this is an accurate representation of their reaction. I then attempted to explain, but it was clear that this person who I thought might actually enjoy one of the SFWPorn Network subreddits was instantly repulsed by the idea.   Maybe you're right, and that the evolution and acceptance of new terms and phrases into the English language may happen faster than I'd think. I accept the possibility that I'm misguided and there is no short or long term negative effect on the base of users of the network. I'm simply using this opportunity to share my opinion and have pleasant discussions like this, discussions that help correct my perspective and trajectory. I do appreciate your involvement."

I always seem to have at least three going at any given time, maybe more, and I can never decide which one to take with me out of the house. It gets worse when I travel, because not only do I want to take all my current reads, but I also want to bring all my old favorites in case I get a hankering to read one of them. With an e-reader, I can have an entire library at my disposal--plus a lot of classics are available for free.   I'd also like to add that I don't find the reading experience to be fundamentally different with an e-reader than with a paper book. E-readers are designed to do only one thing, but they do that one thing really well. I really can't think of anything that I dislike about mine."

At least with e-books I can torrent them and then buy the physical copy later to add to my library.   My local library is severely under funded and focuses on children's materials which I can understand. E-books will never replace the awesomeness of a physical copy, but if you are me ,and you read 5-7 books a month and only ever have about 20$ in extra money after bills, its a life saver.

They were produced around the same time, and possibly in the same town. And while the Library's complete vellum copy (one of three in the world) heralds the beginning of mass reproduction of information and the cultural revolutions that would follow, the single-scribe output that is the Giant Bible is, if not necessarily the pinnacle of manuscript, a beautiful capstone to that era.  Also fun is that the the Library turns the page on the Gutenberg every day.

bookporn,1j5wtj,CJ5ive,3,Sat Jul 27 15:42:03 2013 UTC,"To ease the strain on the eyes:  A library of books is a necessity for anyone who would realise himself or herself to the full.  No one, no home, should be without a library.  ""The world,"" said Voltaire, ""is governed by books.""  The lack of books in a home may prevent or hinder the development of a great mind.  Even a genius like Sir Walter Scott had to write in his Autobiography this sad confession: ""It is with the deepest regret that I recollect in my manhood the opportunities of learning which I neglected in my youth; that through every part of my literary career I have felt pinched and hampered by my own ignorance; and that I would give half the reputation I have had the good fortune to acquire, if by doing so I could rest the remaining part upon a sound foundation of learning and reason.""  ""God be thanked for books!"" exclaimed Dr. Channing.  ""They are the voices of the distant and the dead, and make us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages....  Let ever man, if possible, gather some good books under his roof, and obtain access for himself and family to some social library.  Almost any luxury should be sacrificed to this....  The diffusion of books through the whole community is to work greater effects than artillery, machinery, and legislation.""  Books are a necessity and an enjoyment too.  ""Love of reading,"" said Montesquieu, ""enables a man to exchange the weary hours which come to every one for hours of delight.""  Gibbon declared that, ""a taste for books is the pleasure and glory of my life;"" Emerson said that, ""in the highest civilisation the book is still the highest delight;"" while Hazlitt wrote that, ""books are the first and last, the most home felt, and the most heartfelt of our enjoyments.""  So the great need is to get books.  The rest of it is an advertisement so I'm gonna stop typing there."

bookporn,1ik3rv,ButtEncounter,8,Thu Jul 18 21:02:01 2013 UTC,"RevoltoftheBeavers Quick Guide to Your Dream Job:   You're in high school and you know you want to work in archives, especially with old books. This is great news because it means you have lots of chances to get into the world. So here's number 1: learn a language with a long printing history. So French, German, Italian, Latin, or Greek. Chinese or Sanskrit are ok too if that is your thing. But learn that language and learn it really well; it is the first big barrier to the rare book world. Already know one of those languages? Even better. Learn it more. Pick up a third. Seriously, you will thank your younger self. When you get to college, study history and databases. You need the history to be in the world and you need databases and computer skills to be employable. Computer science and information systems are great places to be academically, as long as you still develop your writing skills. Finding a college with a strong library, research tradition, and especially rare collection (many do, some quite large) helps, which leads to the next point. Work study in the library, especially if they have a big rare collection. See if you really like it. Get all the training you can. Develop your own research interest and specialty. Learn more languages. There will be seminars if you seek them out. Take them. Apply for grants/scholarships like crazy to pay for summer travel and seminars.  Now, you can see if you want to try to work in the field or do library school. It is often a trap, often just a very expensive union card, but it is what it is, access to a much bigger pool of jobs. An MA is another route if you want to be a researcher, or you are eyeing a Ph.D., which is usually the same thing. Just remember, whatever Frank Herbert says, Debt is the mind-killer. Also the wallet-killer. Since you've so wisely taken my advice and studied databases and information systems, you can get an IT job at a research library or, since you have work study and some library training, you can work in Circulation or technical services or another specialty department that you have an interest in. There are a bunch: Photography, conservation, acquisitions. There are other avenues after an MLS, like cataloging, but you'll learn about those while you're there.   So, there are lots of paths to your dream. Good luck and have fun, and this above all: to thine own self be true!  EDIT: Sorry if the format is off and for the first abortive post."

After an examination (some bastard had ripped the binding off of it, ostensibly to cover his crime), it was found to be the stolen Durham Folio and it was returned to its rightful place in Britain. And that guy? He is dead now."

bookporn,1ik3rv,TurrisEburnea,11,Thu Jul 18 15:24:39 2013 UTC,Why do they keep them all in the same room together? What if something goes wrong in there?
bookporn,1ik3rv,Kai_Daigoji,18,Thu Jul 18 15:25:38 2013 UTC,"There are lots of good reasons to keep them together. First, we can ensure that they are in the safest part of the building, with excellent fire suppression systems, vault doors and the like. Our staff are experts in conservation and preservation, as well as in security and emergency response, so the books are vigilantly guarded. Second, we are a research library, so we retain so many copies so that the best scholars in the world can study and compare them. Because of that, they need to be properly organized and immediately available (though their use is restricted to only the most qualified researchers). Third, there are space concerns. The First Folios are all stored flat and are not small, so  in order to store them properly (and in the right temp/humidity) they need to be kept together, on the special flat shelves you see here, to ensure that their lifetime is maximized. Finally, keeping them separate is actually more dangerous than keeping them together. Imagine an emergency scenario where especially important books needed to be relocated to a more safe location. If the most valuable books are spread around the vault, what does that do to your emergency timeline? One would be searching for books instead of saving the collection. No matter what, it is our duty and honor to preserve these artifacts and their cultures of origin, and I'd like to assure you that everyone here works every day to do just that."

I specialized in re-lettering spines with a teeny paintbrush and gold in a paint suspension. Not as expensive as you might think, but trying to get the typeface right was stressful as hell. You've got one shot to get it right, and you never know how old leather and fabric is going to react with the paint, especially when degraded by the elements. The books I fixed were usually valued in the hundreds so the pressure to perform was enormous.   Some books were so bad they had to be decontaminated so they wouldn't infect the rest of the library. Foxing, mildew, rot, silverfish, book lice, book worms, not to mention your garden-variety rat piss...the different smells are horrific and pretty much unforgettable."

I got my start working in the basement of a university library, but after I got good at it I'd come into the booksellers' shops as a freelancer, fix on whatever they had for me and get paid. Not to mention the fact that it was incredibly satisfying to bring an old wreck back to life and make it beautiful again.  Some books I saw were so bad, I flat-out said I couldn't deal with it. That red rot of death combined with pages warped by black mold? NOPE. I've been in rooms that looked quite a bit like the picture and the smell was absolutely choking. God only knows why, but bug infestations often smell sweet, which adds a whole other layer of grossness on top of the mildew and the terror of having a silverfish slither out over your hand fresh from a meal of eating the glue out of the book spines. Ugh! Once I even saw a pile of sawdust from straight-up termites. Nope, nopety-nope nope.  I think one of the most heavily-damaged ""success stories"" I had was some sort of 19th century poetry anthology: the lettering was rubbed off, the leather was pretty faded and beat, and I had to re-sew the book to the spine, mend torn pages, mold new corners for the boards, new gold leaf all over the front and sides, and even tip in new marbled endpapers. But once I reconditioned the leather and had everything in order, it was absolutely gorgeous. I loved taking something from unsellable to really special over the space of a few days.

A decade later, I still got a Pavlovian adrenaline rush: I'd forgotten how every time I entered a room like that, I was about to do something really high-stakes and precise. Ha!

bookporn,1hf7nb,FrostyTheSasquatch,7,Mon Jul 1 15:53:33 2013 UTC,"Publication Date: July 1, 2013  If America is the Roman Empire of our time then New York City is Rome. The pulsating heart of the West pumps greenbacks through the veins of Manhattan, the richest place in the world. Power emanates from it's corporate brains and financial muscle across the whole surface of the globe. So how is it that even in the body of America, land of eternal youth, there is failure, death and decay hidden just beneath its glossy surfaces? A new breed of urban adventurers take a savage ride through the invisible story of the North Eastern USA. From NYC to the infamous Rust Belt, once home to America's heavy industry, States of Decay brings you a glimpse of the broken, the doomed, the entropic dreamlands on the flipside of the silver dollar coin. A unique exploration of everything from abandoned power plants, hospitals, asylums, schools, theatres, steel mills, prisons, factories, hotels, cathedrals, blast furnaces, convents to a boat graveyard. This extended photo-essay functions as a visual poem allowing the reader to draw their own experiences and conclusions from the images themselves. No interpretation necessary. This book will ask disturbing questions and inspire unexpected answers from anyone with an imagination and a heart. Sit back and let us take you on a walk around the Bad Apple.

bookporn,1fux8e,IAmTheWalkingDead,1 point,Fri Jun 7 16:21:51 2013 UTC,Where do they get all those books?
bookporn,1fux8e,Isatis_tinctoria,3,Fri Jun 7 18:53:44 2013 UTC,People trade them in. People are probably lucky if they get pennies for those mass market paperbacks.  Well run used book stores have their inventory computerized so they know what they already have in stock and can turn away trade ins to avoid too much redundancy. They will also know what sells so they can offer better trade in values and take more copies of certain things but not others.
bookporn,1fux8e,starlinguk,2,Fri Jun 7 19:16:36 2013 UTC,Yep. Mostly trades and donations. They have so much they can't really just pay out for more books. They don't need more books.
bookporn,1fux8e,AztroGirl,3,Fri Jun 7 19:39:40 2013 UTC,"What does the store charge for books? Many used book stores I go to charge like 50% of cover price, but you can often get the same book shipped to you for even less than that off the internet. Maybe if they sold some things like mass market paperbacks for $1 or something they could clear out that inventory faster. Or do like a ""fill a bag/box/something, get everything inside for $10.""  Because really it seems like they're expecting that problem to solve itself when it's just the opposite. People don't want to touch those stacks, the stacks block other stacks and block the shelves. It just results in more inventory piling up and not getting moved."
bookporn,1fux8e,solzhen,3,Fri Jun 7 19:55:37 2013 UTC,"Everything I've ever gotten there has been less than $10, including new hardcover copies. And there's a section out front on a cart with 50 cents each. Haggling helps ."

Basically they would reuse the city woodcuts since, you know, these poor folks would have no idea what the cities looked like anyway. The only exceptions were Jerusalem and Venice (Nuremberg, however, was the only city represented across two pages), since everybody knew what was in Jerusalem, and everybody knew that Venice has canals.

bookporn,1f3jq1,righteous_bandy,1 point,Mon May 27 18:49:11 2013 UTC,Shakespeare was as common in a home in the late 19th century as a Bible. Deluxe copies are very common and they usually had somewhat fancy bindings so they could be shown off to guests or just look good sitting out on a table. It looks like a library binding to me. The picture of the inside endpapers are especially telling.  Here's a bookseller selling the same book and it has a description of the binding. http://www.antiqbook.com/books/bookinfo.phtml?nr=327598006&l=nl&seller=

bookporn,1f3jq1,righteous_bandy,4,Tue May 28 19:42:04 2013 UTC,Actually it's not too too surprising. The fact is that older paper is more durable and conserves significantly better. The physical copies of speeches given by Lincoln will well outlive those of Obama because the quality (and price) of paper has declined so much. Source: completed coursework in art conservation.
bookporn,1f3jq1,LaVidaDada,5,Mon May 27 00:24:31 2013 UTC,"That's not entirely true.  Well made paper is well made paper plain and simple, and you can certainly still find it today.  You are correct that after printing was revolutionized in the mid to late 19th century there was a period of time where particularly poor quality paper was churned out because it was cheaper and easier to make.

Early Italian humanists in the 15th century like Poggio Bracciolini and Niccolo Niccoli (so now we're pre-printing) created a new style of handwriting based on the shapes of letters in ancient Roman inscriptions on buildings, statues, and pottery... the famous Venetian printer Aldus Manutius created the first Roman typefaces based on their handwriting, which was much nicer to read than the Gothic typefaces that were meant to look like medieval blackletter."

bookporn,1czrvs,guitartablelamp,2,Wed Apr 24 08:04:55 2013 UTC,"Oh lots! I could write pages and pages. The time, resources, detail and dedication it took to make a single page earns respect. Where I'm not a christian, I find the imagery and artistry of the medieval manuscripts very beautiful.  The inner space where the purple is represents paradise and the double borders sets it apart from the rest of the world. The birds of paradise top left, and beautiful flowing floral throughout the page (growth, freedom, life, etc...) I spy an Alpha and Omegga hanging from a cross, a trinity, another cross...  Charlemagne commissioned it, lots of money thrown into it. All the purple you see is Tyrian purple, which has its own significance and beauty. The lettering is gold and silver (now black.)  This page is significant because it is a full page initial, and the only one in this codex. The ""font"" -- if you will -- of the initials are insular, which is an older style of writing. The sheer amount of detail is fantastic. The size of the page is pretty big. Some internet thing says about 37 cm high and 26 cm wide (14 x 10in) but I remember it being larger.

The mistake is easy to make as written old swedish and modern german are strikingly similar. The title reads ""The Holy Scripture"". ""Tillegnad"" is a way of saying ""Gifted to"" or ""Devoted to"" and Af=Av=To (During christmas in sweden we still follow this format on our presents).  The front page where the translated line reads ""Departure from Egypt"" is not complete, the full translation of the swedish sentence would be ""Children of Isreals departure from Egypt"".  The bible is immaculate, if you want anything more translated feel free to ask. I'm always happy to use my native swedish skills for good rather than for evil."

bookporn,1cih9l,KosherNazi,1 point,Wed Apr 17 14:36:45 2013 UTC,"I know what you mean. The first few times I washed paper was very nerve wracking. But you have to remember that the paper made before about 1870 was made of cotton and linen rags and hold up in water much better than the newer wood pulp paper.  That and the inks used were generally oil based and won't feather or bleed like more modern inks would. Not that I would recommend people to take a part their antique books and chuck them into a tub without proper training of course.   Now for the newer paper that we can't wash there are other ways to deacidify it. There are sprays that have non-alcoholic based solvent and the alkaline mixed together that is very quick and easy to used almost no training needed. The problem with the spray is that it doesn't remove any of the dirt and can very expensive. On average the spray costs about a dollar per page, which is fine if you are talking about just a hand full of documents, but for a whole book, it's generally not worth it. For wash pages (not counting the cost of rebinding) it's literally pennies per page.    Sorry I tend to ramble with I get talking about this stuff."

They have lots of really good resource for professionals and non-professionals a like and a guide for finding conservators in your area.   Archivists have SAA (Society of American Archivists) which does have a directory of archival consultants available.  Outside the US I really can't think of an organization off the top of my head sadly, but I'm sure they are out there. Another option is getting a hold of someone at a local university or large library. If they don't have an archivist on staff, then they probably know of local reputable ones."

This is one of my favouties: ""Lingua universalis"" by Andrea Rethy, from 1821.  He was an Hungarian attempting to build one of the first artificial languages (a fore-runner of Esperanto).  The idea was good, the implementation was .... poor. He strived for brevity, and being an hungarian he expected that all the world would be able to easily differentiate vowels such as e and ë.  By mixing them up, he succeeded in ""condensating"" his language in very few letters, but also made it a hell to pronounce.  For example, ""E"" is five, ""Ë"" is six, ""He"" is fifty, ""Hë"" is sixty, ""Eh"" is five-hundred, ""Ëh"" is six hundred.  Easy-peasy! And incredible good to combine! ""Ëh-he-e"" will be 655, ""Eh-hë-e"" will be 565. Yikes!  The same confusion applies to all kind of words: ""Äj"" means ""nobody"", ""Aj"" means ""who?"", etc.  No wonder his project had no resonance.  Anyway, I found this little booklet about twenty years ago in Budapest, I paid it a few dollars, and of cource it's quite a rare (but not necessarily sought-after) book."

bookporn,1c97w7,Chthonos,3,Sat Apr 13 16:40:16 2013 UTC,"Middle English isn't the easiest thing to learn to read, unfortunately.  You may want to start with learning how to pronounce everything, since the vowels and consonants get pronounced in generally the opposite way you'd expect (e.g. the first word on this page, ""Whan"", is not pronounced like it looks, but rather with a longer A, like in ""father"", so ""Whaan"".). A good pronunciation guide is the way to start. Then find yourself a Middle English dictionary for all the words you won't understand (and there will be a lot!) and, well, just start reading. It's especially helpful to get a side-by-side transliteration to help you along."

With that guess it was easy to verify that this was indeed a Kelmscott title. But why did I recognize these things?   William Morris is an obsession of mine. I adore his poetry (esp. The Defence of Guenevere and other poems and The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs) and his late romances/fantasy novels, which were an early influence on Tolkien."

I have to say my favorite essay collection so far has to be that tiny little black book next to my two Hamlet's that houses the brilliant words of Harold Bloom on Hamlet.  P.S. If you're wondering why I have two norton edition's of Hamlet it's because they have a different editor and use a different blend of the Second Quartro and the First Folio, one being purely the former and the other a mixture. The white one offers views and documents which the editor found important and that I found interesting (Cyrus Hoy (now deceased) focused not only on the nature of man but also on the study of demonology and its lens that can be used to view Hamlet) the purple one (I haven't used it as much as the white 1993 edition) features FAR better annotations, granted some are on the verge of superfluous if you understand their syntax and diction well, but there are so many annotations that are overlooked in other editions which really help you understand certain nuances of the text.  P.S.S. My ""P.S."" is longer than my main reply"
bookporn,1boymt,Jojay1,1 point,Fri Apr 5 08:35:14 2013 UTC,"You have a really solid collection of classics for a kid who is heading off to start a Lit BA. One fascinating process your collection will go through in college is that it will both broaden--you'll pick up more books by historians, anthropologists, philosophers--and it will specialize, especially once you find the period of literature you're most interested in. You'll have the complete works of most of the main figures in your period, plus the most important/well-known critical studies of the period.  If you're really interested in Hamlet (and who isn't?) I recommend Stephen Greenblatt's Hamlet in Purgatory if you haven't already read it. It could be the most important recent book about the play."

bookporn,1boymt,trwhite6878,31,Fri Apr 5 02:53:33 2013 UTC,"Savor this moment. Burn in your mind how it feels to love these books; how it feels to finish one book and want to pick up another one.  Because 4 years from now all the joy you find in reading will be gone.   You won't want to read great books, and if you somehow force yourself to anyway, you won't be able to read it for enjoyment--there will be a constant whispering voice in the back of your head, as if your most nagging lit professor were behind you with every word you read. You will deconstruct meanings reflexively, turning joy into drudgery. You will build and analyze themes that may or may not even be there, but which will either way obstruct the deeper meaning the author intended. If you are very lucky, you will stop reading entirely for 5-10 years afterward, at which point you may, in your thirties, find that you can read for enjoyment once again--occasionally.  Not to be a bummer when you're all young and enthusiastic, but that's how it is for most lit majors.  On a similarly dour note, unless you are independently wealthy, do yourself a favor and do a second major in something useful, or do an apprenticeship in something technical, or maybe start a successful billion-dollar web startup before dropping out. Because no one is going to hire a lit major to do anything they wouldn't hire a high school graduate to do.  Again, sorry to be a bummer, but that's the voice of experience talking, and the job market hasn't gotten any easier since I graduated many years ago."
bookporn,1boymt,Poemi,16,Thu Apr 4 23:22:30 2013 UTC,"Let me be blunt: if you don't absolutely love reading and writing, then yes, the above is true.  Most English/Lit majors don't major in the subject because they love it. They major in it because they hear it's easy. That, or they do sort of like it, but they don't love it. Maybe they enjoy picking up a YA novel every now and again, or maybe they really liked that one series. But they don't love literature. They don't love the written word.  They graduate after four years -- after hearing about how they are destined to have a shitty job they could've gotten without a degree -- and they believe it. So they ignore the tech writing jobs, or the jobs in advertising. They ignore the editor positions. They never consider going into publishing, because they hear it's a dead field (ignoring the digital realm). They don't consider PR. They don't consider being an account manager (ignoring that the field benefits greatly from communication skills they've mastered -- or should have, if they were paying attention). And journalism? Who reads the news these days?  They don't consider combining their writing/editing skills with something else, either. Because that would be selling out, or something.  And god forbid they try and teach. What, do you want to be part of a joke?  Yes, if you coast through an English/Lit program and expect that piece of paper alone to get you a job, you're fucked. But if you pick up some freelance experience while you're at school, or you intern at a place in a field you like, then you're going to make money. Not six figures -- but enough to live comfortably in most areas of the country.  Is it a harder go than a STEM degree? Probably. But if you enjoy it -- if you wake up and say, ""fuck, I love writing and I never want to do anything else,"" then do it. Do it and own that shit.  Just be aware you're going to have to be at the top, and you're going to have to deal with bitter English majors, STEM fiends, and the like every step of the way.  And as a final note, if you seriously get out of college and literature is ""ruined"" for you, then I seriously don't know what to tell you. I can read Derrida, Wordsworth, and Tom Goddamn Clancy back-to-back and enjoy every line of each."

I can read Derrida, Wordsworth, and Tom Goddamn Clancy back-to-back and enjoy every line of each.""   This is the point that I was trying to make. If you like literature, and are seeking intellectual growth a lit major is a good choice. Warning someone about employment issues is helpful, but telling OP that they will learn to hate reading raises some red flags for me."

The way you see publishing houses becoming revolving doors on Publishers Lunch you'd think the world was ending. Thanks."
bookporn,1boymt,lolastrasz,0,Sat Apr 6 23:08:09 2013 UTC,"There are different types of love for literature. In my experience, most people who enjoy the experience of reading and then spend 4 years deconstructing that enjoyment come out disappointed. But there are some people whose love is more analytical from the start. They might fare better, but most students aren't them.  There's a intellectual level of enjoyment that can come from reading Milton after years of academic study, a voice that says ""I know so much more about what I'm reading than most people can imagine, and I like that!"". But that intellectual enjoyment inevitably comes at the expense of the visceral experience of reading, which is what gets shredded by academic study. Shakespeare won't make you shudder with delight after you've dissected his every phrase on a cutting board, then been graded on your butchery.  As for career considerations, sure, there are a handful of niche jobs that specifically call for English/Lit degrees. And there are a hundred times more people with those degrees than there are jobs for those people.  As for love of writing, anyone who wants to write well can accomplish more through self-study and diligent practice than by subjecting their growth to university professors, who are often failed writers themselves. Only a small percentage of successful novelists actually majored in English. I've never actually known anyone who started an English or literature degree saying, ""Man, I can't wait to get a job in technical writing!"" Or advertising.  Me, I didn't go anywhere until going back to graduate school and getting skills in something useful to the market. My undergrad education is still relevant, but a minority of my actual work. I'm not speaking from bitterness: financially I do quite well. I'm just sharing my experience, and the experience of many others I've known, for what it's worth."
bookporn,1boymt,exploding-penguin,7,Fri Apr 5 03:30:05 2013 UTC,"There are a hundred times more people than positions, sure. That's what they tell you constantly. What they don't tell you, however, is that the large majority of those people are not good writers. They simply aren't.  I mean, assuming you graduated with an English degree -- do you remember your classes? Do you remember who sat next to you? I can honestly say that across two different universities my classmates were just there to get a grade and get out. I met/talked to probably 50 or so English majors, and only three of them expressed any interest in writing. Most just took the major because a). they thought it was easy (and ended up coasting with a c/b average), or b). they enjoyed reading, but not writing.  Most of these people fit into your original post. They float along in jobs that aren't related to their major at all.  But the three that enjoyed writing? One is a writer for Polygon, another works as a freelance novel editor, and the last is an editor/writer for an advertising agency.  Why is it so hard to believe that someone would want a job writing professionally? While my goal is to teach, if that doesn't work out I'll eagerly jump into ad writing! That stuff is fun, man. You're getting paid to be creative.  The notion that you can love to write and not go to school for it is absolutely true. And of course, you don't have to go to college to be a novelist. With that said, the idea that most university professors are failed writers seem quite bitter on your part. The only two professors I've come into contact with that have written novels are both published -- and both continue to write and love it.  Past that, my enjoyment of British romanticism has literally nothing to do with what I know about it. It comes from a genuine feeling of awe that I get years after I was exposed to the texts for the first time. I feel like there's this anti-""pretentiousness"" thing on Reddit when it comes to literature and just reading in general. It seems that people think that when you study this stuff you lose your ability to look at it through ""pure"" eyes. That's bullshit. When it comes to genre fiction I haven't lost anything either. It's all chill."
bookporn,1boymt,lolastrasz,-1,Fri Apr 5 03:46:49 2013 UTC,"Re: Romanticism--I was one of maybe two students in my high school AP English classes that actually enjoyed reading Moby Dick and Wuthering Heights. I still do. Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, Poe, Goethe (well, maybe not Goethe so much), etc. are wonderful. But there were a good many years in between where I had no stomach for them, thanks to school.  Yes, there are jobs out there, and there are/were plenty of indifferent students in every program. But I think it would be remiss of me to not mention the hard realities of the ""real world"" to anyone about to set off on a degree journey that leaves so many feeling lost and betrayed today. The days of waltzing into a decent office job because you hold a liberal arts diploma ended about 20 years ago. A lot of those new grads today are working retail."

bookporn,1boymt,exploding-penguin,1 point,Fri Apr 5 08:06:42 2013 UTC,"It's not impossible. But the cold, hard reality is that jobs for humanities majors are drying up. And the other reality is that generally, university programs in the humanities (I look at literature specifically, but there are plenty others), for undergrads and grads, are not doing a good job of preparing their students for this fact. When I started - only a few years ago - I was drawn in by programs who kept telling me that ""there are always jobs for good people."" That's unequivocally false. It doesn't just take effort and planning. It takes a lot of talent, and frankly, some luck."
bookporn,1boymt,fegh00t,1 point,Fri Apr 5 14:47:54 2013 UTC,"Jobs are drying up, but it isn't as dire as you make it sound.  Fifteen years ago all you had to do to land an office job (of some sort) was to graduate with basically any degree. That's changed now. Now, if you're going to college, you'd better want to translate your degree into something workable. Most English students can't do that.  As I said before, most English majors just aren't... well, they aren't good. And you're right, undergrad and grad programs do a shitty job of preparing humanities grads for the ""real world."" Most still graduate with the degree -> job attitude. Now, though, the attitude should be degree + internships + a developed portfolio + proper networking -> job.  Don't get me wrong, I still warn anyone taking the major that it's a rough road. And yes, it does require some luck (charisma, honestly) to make it work.  But I still think English majors who love what they do (and are great at it) are marketable."
bookporn,1boymt,Zerocool947,1 point,Fri Apr 5 15:00:03 2013 UTC,"I think we generally agree here. The only thing I'll add is that English majors train their students to be English professors, and that's about it. THOSE jobs are drying up, and that's what the problem is (and yes, it is absolutely as dire as I make it sound there). The last English department I came from had one opening and got four hundred applications. There are stories exactly like this in most humanities departments all over the Western world. The humanities academy is training its students how to be academics in the humanities, and that's where the entire problem is. There aren't enough jobs there. Not even close. And they're getting fewer and fewer."

I, too, would enjoy teaching at the university level, but with a M.S. and plenty of real world experience I can be a lecturer down the road if I want. I don't care about tenure track.

bookporn,1boymt,pimpernel666,0,Fri Apr 5 02:06:15 2013 UTC,"exactly, I appreciate what he says and reading /u/lolastrasz I seem to be the person who he speaks of. Personally I don't enjoy reading in the traditional sense, I see simply reading things too vapid, so what if somebody can read Heart of Darkness five times faster than I can. I hold the highest skill in my AP Literature class and it isn't because I enjoy the action of reading but rather I enjoy the analysis and the surgical aspect of literature while simultaneously adding that to the very artistic aesthetic of the piece I'm reading. I consider a good reading to be one that gives me a headache and insomnia and tortures me with whether I'm right or not, I enjoy this arduous process towards understanding and if anything I consider it the most necessary aspect of reading. People read something like Austen and they view it as simple because it lacks, let's say, the complex style of Joyce and in doing so they overlook the crafting of the most complex societal interactions that she interweaves into her characters so as to bring a life to them within our minds. This is who I am, I don't aspire to be anything other than content, I only desire to teach what I have learned to those to come through profession or perhaps through writing literature or essays (which i consider my most enjoyable pastime). Either way, my AP Literature teacher sees me as a college level student, he sees the way I approach and enjoy literature and tells me to trust myself and naive as it may sound I will take this man's word because I see him as a kindred mind and soul.

That being said if you'd like some sort of follow up as to my intent as a lit major upvote this post if you're good with how I explained things here just don't touch this post and let it drown to the bottom. I really don't feel like rewording my letter (it's 1,300+ words that I've written over two days and looked over in the two days in between so the well of self-explanation seems to be running a bit dry, at least at 1:21 A.M. it is.) Anyways I appreciate all the words of advice and encouragement and I will definitely keep at it.   P.S. If any of your were wondering my favorite writer at the moment is Joyce.

bookporn,1ak2x6,missslushie,6,Tue Mar 19 03:07:58 2013 UTC,"My tip is to relax, not worry, and remember that more than anything else Ulysses is funny. I studied it at university, so I had to go quite in depth, but ultimately, for me at least, it's a big, clever, silly book by an Irishman who loved scat porn and dirty jokes. There's some deep stuff in there, certainly, but nothing incredible. If you don't enjoy the wordplay and the fluxing writing styles then maybe the book just isn't for you. We're taught that if a book is a 'classic' then there's something wrong with us, but not everyone is suited to every book.

Mind, don't get too shackled to it, parsing through every single line, finishing only a few pages in a whole night. But this book will answer most of your initial confusion.  BUT  Have you read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist yet? Portrait is especially essential before tackling Ulysses since it's a portrait of Stephen Daedalus (and by proxy, Joyce himself). Those are MUCH easier reading, and quite good. Although I don't care much for Dubliners, personally, it dose lay a foundation to Joyce's vivacious Dublin.  Keep in mind that some readings demand time. So don't let that be a factor to pressure to you. Let the book do its work first before you get stuck on matters of plot, meaning, whathaveyou. Ask ""What's going on here?"", not ""What did Joyce mean here?"".   And enjoy."
bookporn,1ak2x6,pooroldedgar,3,Tue Mar 19 04:46:32 2013 UTC,"I'm not here to disagree to u/Nifarious in any way, but merely provide a counterpoint. Lord knows lots of people struggle with it, but if I still argue that Ulysses is a very fun book. Try to read it in that spirit and worry less about trying to ""get it."" Missing references to ancient Greek battles? Eh, you'll survive. Didn't pick up on what the corresponding organ was for ""Wandering Rocks?"" There's still plenty left.   Maybe if you need a hand, it should be less about giving you additional information and more about giving you the practical info. Go to sparknotes.com or some such and just get a basic summary. Don't worry about finding out what's going to happen. If you're reading Ulysses for the ploy, you're gonna have a bad time. [Spoiler alert: At the end, he goes to bed.] But reading a summary can leave you free from following the who/what/where/when, and give you more room to purely focus on the language. And that, my friend, is where the action is. The books got all sorts of great little jokes and turns of phrase. ""Ham and his descendants, mustard and bred there."" Buck Mulligan's plan to open up his own stud farm with himself as the bull. And poor, poor Dignam."

bookporn,1ak2x6,missslushie,2,Tue Mar 19 13:29:35 2013 UTC,"I read the beginning of the Dubliners when I had to teach it as a long term sub last year in a high school English class. That wasn't so bad. Never read Portrait of an Artist though.  I understand the plot (mostly because I've been reading sparknotes along side it), but when they talk, I get so lost because the references and dialect are lost on me. I don't have an annotated copy that I'm reading so I know that's why I don't get it. I think maybe this book just isn't for me, but I'm so invested I will still finish."
bookporn,1ak2x6,Nifarious,2,Tue Mar 19 14:59:45 2013 UTC,"Dubliners is all about its concluding story. It's worth going back just for that. It's about as touchy-feely as Joyce gets. Portrait lays the foundation for Stephen's rebellion in Ulysses, so only go there if that interests you.  While this book is for the few, it does have something to offer everyone. I'd just emphasize on what you do enjoy or get out of your current reading without hesitating over what's an impasse. Each chapter does have its own style, anyway. Personally, the brothel scene to the end along with the early Stephen chapters are the parts that interest me most. For some, it's all about Molly's concluding chapter. Others love the simplicity and everydayness of Bloom. Some thrive on the vivacity of the common Dublin culture. Or the play on the romance genre at the masturbation scene. Or the technical journey through the history of literature in chapter 8 or 10, whichever that was. Or Jewishness in Ulysses. Or the religion. Or Ulysses's Odyssey and its classical allusions.  If all else fails, go with the experience of the reading, like long, very long poetry."

bookporn,1ak2x6,Nifarious,4,Tue Mar 19 01:32:31 2013 UTC,Sacerdotal nonsense.   Please explain like I don't have google.
bookporn,1ak2x6,fegh00t,3,Tue Mar 19 05:30:31 2013 UTC,"All I know is ""sacerdote"" means priest in Spanish. Probably means dogmatic or highfalutin ."
bookporn,1ak2x6,Nifarious,3,Tue Mar 19 05:43:39 2013 UTC,Yup.
bookporn,1ak2x6,fegh00t,1 point,Tue Mar 19 06:19:22 2013 UTC,"Sacerdotal=priestly. So I mean capital A Art, making art sacred and an object of worship, protected from and untouched by banality, kept hidden from the public and under shrouds, etc. In a way, Ulysses is a work that makes you its servant, even warrior, but this sort of readership needs to be resisted if one's to be a critic rather than a devotee on bended knee. Viewing things in terms of perfect archetypes and models is all a part of this zealotry, as innocent as it may be meant.   Granted, this is all a bit of a commonplace on /r/bookporn, but one needn't rely on the capital A Art crutch to enjoy books as objects."

bookporn,1ak2x6,Jack_Ketch,1 point,Tue Mar 19 01:34:44 2013 UTC,Why is perfection an ugly word/concept?
bookporn,1ak2x6,Nifarious,1 point,Tue Mar 19 06:29:11 2013 UTC,"Do you want me to say any more on what I got into in the explanation above? Basically, perfection = making a model to aspire to and evaluate yourself/things from, which = making an idol, which = the sacerdotalism I covered. When people call something perfect, it's a refusal to think about it, but rather treat it as a sacred object for adoration. It's a revolt from religion and its grip on art.  Gaddis's Recognitions is a wonderful, equally long and dense work to go into this, but Ulysse's Daedelus is all about this non serviam as well."

bookporn,1ak2x6,mmmm_whatchasay,5,Tue Mar 19 07:54:51 2013 UTC,"If it's any consolation, I agree with you. It always annoys me when people describe a book as perfection. It's not, nothing is. Perfection is such a silly word to use about literature, and it always just seems like they're trying to elevate their own subjectivity into objectivity and shut down any flaws someone might perceive."
bookporn,1ak2x6,ThirdPoliceman,1 point,Tue Mar 19 09:15:22 2013 UTC,"After all I said about the negative, priestly attitude, there's also the mystic and his use of the word perfection. Granted, perfection would really be a popular misnomer for it, but the mystic approach is to worship the experience of the reading and regard it as holy and therefore perfect. This is a very different sort of worshiper than the priest. The latter is all about controlling and protecting the category of Art, the former is enraptured in the lived, spiritual, sexual embrace that art gives. And art that has aura (cf. Walter Benjamin) DOES allow for this experience which could be orgasmicly called perfection. But if we're to do anything more with the text than fall into onanism with it, we simply must not stand (rather kneel) with the mystics."
bookporn,1ak2x6,mmmm_whatchasay,-3,Tue Mar 19 18:38:03 2013 UTC,"Unless you're reading it for a class, you really have no business reading Ulysses. Every word is so nuanced, every symbol so poignant, that it's one of the most frustrating books in the world to read. That said, it's also possibly the greatest novel ever written."
bookporn,1ak2x6,Nifarious,2,Tue Mar 19 05:19:53 2013 UTC,"I agree, and it is my favorite book of all time.  I needed a tour guide through Ulysses the first time, and was lucky to have a wonderful professor in college to do that."
bookporn,1ak2x6,ThirdPoliceman,1 point,Tue Mar 19 11:00:28 2013 UTC,I took a course on it in college and we would go to meetings of the James Joyce Society of Boston.

bookporn,1ak2x6,Nifarious,1 point,Tue Mar 19 06:59:23 2013 UTC,"It demands work on the reader's part in new ways. It's accessible to anyone who'll put in the effort, but most people won't/can't. It's a work in discourse with all of human culture, or rather, it's a thriving, interlaced mass of all human culture. It IS a story that can be understood and enjoyed rather simply as well, but one effectively has to make oneself a reader of Ulysses to get to that point. Getting the 'plot' from cliffnotes will do absolutely nothing to get you there.  Guy wanders around Dublin during the day w/o his keys. Bumps into other guy who's struggling w/ religion and in need of a father figure. Said guy gets drunk and rowdy at a brothel, main guy takes him to his home, breaks in. They part ways having almost made a connection, but failing. In the meantime, protagonist's wife thinks about her affair, but ends up settling back on her man who has more spunk. Btw, protagonist had also jerked it to a girl on the beach.  Edit: Wait, How have you NOT gotten to Ulysses yet with a name like that??"

Cranbury is actually a house with rooms you can wander through,but the room sizes sometimes make it difficult to browse, with Montclair being a really long store with a main floor and smaller basement and second floor, and a bit more space to get around. Cranbury, from what I remember only does used books, Montclair will do a mix of old and new, with newer books up front and sometimes prominently displayed in special sections like childrens books or cooking. Overall I prefer Montclair, but probably because it's closer to me. Cranbury's prices are definitely cheaper though. Another used bookstore is The Old Bookshop in Morristown. Smaller than the others, not as cheap as Cranbury, about the same as Montclair...but if looking for old NJ postcards or maps, or assorted old illustrations, they have drawes and drawers of stuff."

bookporn,197b15,-rix,7,Mon Feb 25 20:32:40 2013 UTC,"it's difficult to read and fully understand those ""ancient"" books because they are nearly all written in latin, just a few books are written in old high german language and even less books are written in english.      i'm studying comparative literary studies (this might explain my affection for books) and have a minor bachelor degree in history.. so all in all this job fits perfectly for me.    funny enough i've studied one semester computer graphics before i've changed to german language and literature studies (where i've got my major bachelor degree).. at the very beginning i thought that i would need a bachelor of science degree to be later successful in life, but i came to the conclusion that i should study something i like. until now i don't regret this decesion, maybe this will change later in life, i don't know.."

(Vergleichende Sprachwissenschaften/Indogermanistik).  Btw, the Latin would pose lass of a problem than the old German, I think. I know I can read German from ~Luther and co, but it ain't easy, and they are at least from the north. I think an old text from southern Germany would be really difficult. Latin otoh doesn't change much, and after ~500 or so it isn't that complex anymore either."

It definitely got better the more times I read it. For me, it was like Shakespeare works, once I really got the rhythm of Charlotte Bronte I could see all of the hidden treasures in the writing. The biggest thing I like about it is that it seems to age with me. The first few times I read it, it was about a girl coming to grips with the world. As I got older, it was about a woman experiencing life for the first time. If I am in love it is an epic tale of love's triumph. If I am in a breakup it is a sad tale of the things you lose in life. Somehow, it always fits my life. It makes me cry when I need to, smile when I want to and leave reality when I choose to.  TL;DR   It took time to really appreciate. It always speaks to my life."

I'm gonna guess Rotterdam area, HBO/university educated, left voting (PvdA?) and your dad might be born/raised in South Africa? Am I in the right direction?"
bookporn,16vpbz,Sauris0,2,Sun Jan 20 11:18:31 2013 UTC,"Wow. You have a lot of elements in there. Rotterdam area is correct; Delft, me and my dad are big Feyenoord fans. He went to uni. He was a party member of Groenlinks for 25 years, and we have been to South Africa 3 times, but he wasn't born or raised there, we just fell in love with the country!  Trivia: He actually wrote a book himself, which is also in there"
bookporn,16vpbz,Sauris0,2,Sun Jan 20 15:29:25 2013 UTC,"Rotterdam area because of the Feyenoord book, Delft would be consider The Hague Area, but ADO sucks so that makes sense. The uni and the left wing poltics I guess because my parents own a lot of the books your dad does and they are left wing HBO (uni dropouts) educated. There's also some feminist writers in there so that was telling. I had to guess South Africa because it was the one travel book that was out of the regular area, also the extra books (de droom van and a language guide), I had a teacher who was born there but was dutch so I guessed it was possible. Thanks for posting and responding, I felt like a proper Sherlock :)"
bookporn,16vpbz,synesthesiac,2,Sun Jan 20 21:36:52 2013 UTC,"Btw, the Rotterdam area also makes sense because my father was born in Dordrecht!"
bookporn,16vpbz,doihavetosignup,2,Mon Jan 21 13:18:48 2013 UTC,I would not have guessed that from the books :(

Edit: I do not know how they organize them. It looks to be Dewey at a glance, but I've been told that they hire students to organize them still. Both professors are quite old."
bookporn,16ul3n,Crowley42,2,Sat Jan 19 08:34:23 2013 UTC,So you're a Russian student? I hope to have a library matching your professor's on Russia-related literature one day. And if only my profs would invite me round :c
bookporn,16ul3n,mouseWfangs,2,Mon Jan 28 19:00:03 2013 UTC,"Yeah, Russian and History so I wound up taking classes by both professors and even classes with both at the same time. They're pretty amazing people; really gave me something on a deeper level than just education - as if I'm now motivated to pursue my dreams of professorship. I'm certainly working on a library like theirs, but it'll probably take me 50 years."

Instead, we saw books piled nearly floor to ceiling all through the inside. Some of the piles had already fallen over, and there was no floor space left to even navigate through it.  Strangely, the door next door was piled with more books, and there was a long stairway that led up to what we assumed were living quarters, with piles of books on each step.  Obviously the place is no longer open, but we were wondering if anyone could shed some light on the mystery. The whole thing just struck us as a Twilight Zone episode, complete with a possibly extremely eccentric owner.”"

bookporn,16chjm,deadbabiesrofl,7,Fri Jan 11 01:24:05 2013 UTC,You've basically described entire cities in England.  Oxford essentially looks like a mix of garish tourist traps attempting to blend into centuries old crumbling walls with homeless staggering around selling celebrity magazines.
bookporn,16chjm,Belaires,1 point,Fri Jan 11 01:57:43 2013 UTC,"Oh, I have never been.  Most everything in America is garish so at least there is something to try and blend with. I suppose that it must be difficult as an architect who is commissioned to build something new next to buildings that are centuries old."
bookporn,16chjm,deadbabiesrofl,3,Fri Jan 11 04:30:30 2013 UTC,"This is one of the more sympathetic efforts I've seen of this juxtaposition. There's a photoset at the moment on /r/unitedkingdom, where you'll see an old church that's been converted to a Tesco Express, which I feel has been a wasted opportunity.  This happens quite often in the United Kingdom, and other European countries. The Bradford Waterstones in my upload was originally built in 1867 as a Wool Exchange. Since wool isn't exchanged much in Bradford any longer, the building could have fallen out of use.  Personally, I am much happier when I see these old Victorian and Gothic buildings used in a new way, than when I see them stop being used at all. The internal beauty of the Wool Exchange deserves to be seen. And while I might initially recoil at the sight of a Krispy Kreme inside the 11th-Century Oxford Castle, I do appreciate this re-purposing, and the continued use of historical buildings.  I'm assuming you're American, so you might not be familiar with the idea of a Listed Building. These are buildings that, under the 1985 Granada Convention for the protection of the architectural heritage of Europe, are protected from demolition or alteration without special permission. The Bradford Wool Exchange is Grade-I listed (on a I, II, III scale), and as such enjoys the same protection as Buckingham Palace, Warwick Castle, the Houses of Parliament, and so on.  With around half a million buildings enjoying Listed Building status, there are lots of examples such as this, where owners are required by law to make as few changes as possible to the building, while still trying to successfully operate their business within."
bookporn,16chjm,benparsons,-1,Fri Jan 11 13:13:16 2013 UTC,"I bet it's not that bad when you're actually there - done well that juxtaposition can be very effective (there is a lot of opportunity to experiment in the UK!)  Unfortunately, sorry OP but this photo sucks - the overexposure means that all you see is the contrast, which makes it look tackier than it probably is."

I am by no means a photographer, and a more experienced person can do the place a lot better justice. I'm mostly glad that I managed to put it in the right subreddit!"
bookporn,16chjm,childofmalcav,1 point,Fri Jan 11 12:26:31 2013 UTC,"See I find this a beautiful picture but it still doesn't give any inclination of what it feels like to be in there, in between the rows of books and the quiet and the smell of new ink and coffee.

It's a literally rare treat to hold and read the work in its original form.  It's since (last year) had the front board come totally off, and needs rebacking. I'll have the original boards slotted perhaps, and the original spine laid back down, by a conservator. Its current condition allowed me to scan it, because there's no way I would ever risk that with a tight firm binding.  So enjoy the engravings. I think they are among the highest resolution scans out there on the web, as far as I can tell.  Merry Christmas"

bookporn,14g8s8,gatheringdust,3,Sat Dec 8 15:13:45 2012 UTC,"If you are interested in a more detailed answer I would recommend reading Scribes, Script, and Books: The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance By Leila Avrin, particularly pages 289-292 of chapter 12 ""Papermaking"" which can be found on Google books here.   But for the more tl;dr version: In short papermaking was not a new craft by any means in Europe in the 1600s and good papermakers knew how to roll the molds to make the paper pulp settle evenly when it was raised from the vat. After that the wet sheets would be pressed in large stacks with a layer of felt in between each sheet. This would squeeze most of the water and help flatten it. After that it would be hung in the rafters of the mill to dry. When it was dry to would be dipped in to a sizing agent. This was a form of water proofing to keep paper from blotting ink like a cloth, (which isn't far from what paper was at the time as it was made form old rags) After the paper dried a second time it would be polished with a smooth rock, glass or glazing hammer for a smooth finish.     Even then hand made paper would not be like the smooth, thin, crisp paper that we know today. Hand made paper is generally thicker, softer, and had visible lines running through it from the chain and laid wires on the mold.  I hope that answered your question."

In the never-ending trench warfare in North-East France, the German infantryman was sleeping as usual with his Bible underneath his head. Without warning, a direct hit destroyed his dug-out almost completely, wounding and killing many of his comrades. Geiler was not harmed and managed to get out of the rubble. It was only later when he retrieved his Bible he discovered to his astonishment that the holy book had saved him. His son, Professor Gottfried Geiler, from Leipzig, said: “A 4cm large piece of shrapnel tore the Bible under his head. It broke through, but not completely, so my father was unharmed and still alive. “It’s true to say that the Bible, which has been kept ever since as a precious memento in the family, really was his salvation.” Geiler’s grandson Markus Geiler said it had also been treated as a ‘family anti-war memorial’. “I can remember my father leading me to his bookcase, opening it and taking out the Bible which was wrapped in thick paper,” he recalled. He said: ‘Look, this is what saved your grandfather’s life.’ It was always something very special when this book was unpacked.”    Source: Retronaut"

bookporn,11v7u9,Xisroc,2,Mon Oct 22 02:38:12 2012 UTC,"It was missing a chip that included some of the original title. I rebuilt the case behind the original spine by lifting the leather on the outside of the covers then lining the spine of the case with a heavy Japanese tissue called moriki.  It can have a surprisingly leathery look and feel after lining, painting and waxing it.  I then fold the new lining down to make the head and tail of the book before sealing it all together when I put the block back in the case. What you're seeing is the new tissue spine blended into the original.   Before waxing the tissue and leather, I used 24kt gold and a tiny brush to recreate the missing bit of the original title.  I also used leather die and a q-tip to even out and clean up the look of the leather.    Afterwards I made a wash out of an acrylic paint I mixed to match the blue cloth part of the covers and gave it a more even and clean look."

bookporn,119yvv,CT_Librarian,3,Thu Oct 11 04:55:19 2012 UTC,"Ah, I found an article about it in the Yale Daily News:  Myth: The library’s fire-extinguishing system removes the air from the book stacks in the event of a conflagration, dooming any librarians inside to a slow death by asphyxiation.  Mostly False: According to Jones, this legend has a kernel of truth: Instead of water sprinklers that would harm the rare books collections, he said, a combination of halon and Inergen gases would be pumped into the stacks to stop the combustion process, and thus the spread of fire.  “They do lower the percentage of oxygen, but not enough to kill any librarians,” Jones said.  The inner stacks surrounded by glass that house the Beinecke Library’s delicate collections (known to insiders as “the Tower”) are airtight in order to slow the books’ aging process. This presented problems in the mid-1970s when a bookworm infestation could not be addressed with traditional airborne insecticides, Jones said. To solve the problem, the library worked with Yale entomologist Charles Remington, who recommended that the affected books be wrapped in plastic and frozen at minus 33 degrees for three days. The process, which is still used on all of the Beinecke Library’s new acquisitions, took two and a half years to complete, Jones said."

Garbage and useless.  As for the ""not many of them are being used digitally"" I wonder if it's because of the same reason at the uni near me. To download or view the digital copy you must be on the campus's internet. And you can have the copy on your computer to keep from then on. But students who go home and try to view the same book on the uni's website can't open or download the file. Even if they log-in with their student ID. Pointless and counter-productive."

It was bought in 2001 by Jim Irsay (Indianapolis Colts football team owner) for 2.43 million US dollars. It is available for public viewing, with the first 30 feet (9 m) unrolled. Between 2004 and 2005, the scroll was displayed in a number of museums and libraries in the US, Ireland, and the UK."
bookporn,10r5ih,fernguts,3,Mon Oct 1 12:23:49 2012 UTC,I got to see it. Fascinating to see the corrections and additions. And there was absolutely no paragraphs in the original manuscript. At all.
bookporn,10r5ih,distertastin,4,Tue Oct 2 00:22:23 2012 UTC,"Legend has it that Kerouac wrote this book over three weeks, barely sleeping and taking lots of bennies. He used a scroll instead of individual sheets of paper to cut down on interruptions. It's pretty amazing to think that someone could write a book on a single piece of paper, basically committing himself to the idea that he wasn't going to has any false starts or dead ends or pages that he'd later reject in his process.   http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11709924"

I just read your link in case it was mentioned. A dog ate the ending   ""The very end of the scroll is missing, and it's just a ragged edge,"" says Canary. ""Jack wrote on there, 'Ate by Patchkee, a dog' — and that was Lucien Carr's cocker spaniel.""We don't really have the original ending."""

Dr Benway has some pretty great scenes in the book. then again, the completeness of homo-eroticism in the book is so much more graphic than could be put on the big screen.   to answer your question though: kinda, sure."
