Metalcore,3e3okp,Ne0nBlur,9,Tue Jul 21 21:30:25 2015 UTC,That's funny they think that because I consider myself a big Architects fan and I think The Here And Now had a decent amount of good jams on it. In my opinion every Architects album has about 5 amazing songs on it and the other songs are just kinda meh and sound the same as the others.

Metalcore,3e2ye2,nohitter21,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:04 2015 UTC,... thats actually interesting. Ive only listened the song a few times because it so much worse than their previous stuff. Also what confused me was that the theme was so different and I thought it might be because Oli got recently married and is overall happy at the moment
Metalcore,3e2ye2,SantazLittleHelper,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:01 2015 UTC,"Right before they premiered Happy Song, Jordan Fish was asked if ""Happy Song"" was considered to be a single off the new album or just a new song. He said it wasn't a single which makes it a bit weird if they're making a video for it anyways.

Metalcore,3e2ye2,nohitter21,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:52 2015 UTC,Exactly what I thought when I saw it. It's a little off topic but I'm curious if you have watched the second season at all and your thoughts on it currently?
Metalcore,3e2ye2,DigginDeep,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"Watched the first 4 episodes, haven't seen the one from this past Sunday yet (probably will at some point today), but it's definitely not as good as the first. Having 4 main characters means that you're getting less time with each of them and less time to develop a relationship, so when things happen to them, you aren't as invested as you were with Rust and Marty. Granted it's still better than most things on TV, but it's not amazing or anything. If the first season was like a 9.5, this would be like a 7.5 or so out of 10."
Metalcore,3e2ye2,nohitter21,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"Feel the same exact way. Having four main characters makes the story way too congested for me to have a vested interest in any of them. In my opinion, I believe the script isn't as well written as well, even though it is Nick again but yet again, I'm a little biased after the brilliance of last season."
Metalcore,3e2ye2,DigginDeep,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"Some of the shit coming out of the characters' mouths is just awkward as hell, in a ""no one on earth would ever say that, ever"" kind of way. Like Ani said something about memories last week and I was like....are you kidding me?"

It built up this hype that they could never live up to. I don't hate them, but judging them by this subreddit no matter how good they are, they seem over rated."
Metalcore,3e2ye2,DoomDash,-3,Tue Jul 21 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"Not even a top 30 metalcore band? I disagree. They are one of the most popular bands in the genre by far, I'd argue that they're easily top 5."

Metalcore,3e3iqn,A_bacon2012,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, over time I've heard more inclusion of Nu-Metal elements, but not a growing ""Linkin Park vibe"".    Through all of their stylistic changes, hip hop has been such a major, in-your-face element of Linkin Park's sound.  I don't think anyone can deny that Chester and Mike are easily the unique identifiers of most any Linkin Park song.  Of course Metalcore bands have been including glitch and electronic elements increasingly more over the years.  Of course they've mixed more clean passages into what was once a very breakdown-heavy genre.  That said, I hear no Metalcore trend of including hip hop vocals with pretty dope flow, no overall trend of including, say...record scratches, as Hybrid Theory especially had its share of.  In fact generally I find that hip hop as a genre, particularly vocally, has been one of the most difficult elements to successfully meld into Metalcore.  Linkin Park succeeds at that hip hop/rock mix better than any of their modern peers.  Linkin Park, Nu-Metal, Hip Hop, Metalcore--all great things on their own.  Metalcore is by no means becoming an amalgam of the former three."

Metalcore,3e3iqn,I_the_mighty,4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:13 2015 UTC,I think Dangerkids is the only band that should stay the path they established with their debut album. Other bands going for nu-metal/hopecore/alt.rock/whateverthefuckgenre are killing my vibes.

Metalcore,3e3iqn,Sches-fo,0,Tue Jul 21 20:20:29 2015 UTC,Sylar & Dangerkids.   Their songs are basically what you'd get when you mix the electronic elements of Hybrid Theory/Meteora into a metalcore band. And I love both of them.

They seemed to have tuned down the guitars to make it seem ""heavier"" but it also just feels a bit more boring. Vocally there is a lot more talking on the album, like he goes from screams to just talking a lot.  But overall the album is a lot of fun. I've listened to it a ton so if you like there other stuff you will probably find some fun with GP."

Metalcore,3dxvz3,Ridley290,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"(On the genre as a whole) I completely agree. There's so many bands switching to ""hopecore"" (Love that term btw) as their lyrical focus. I'd say just leave it to We Came as Romans and The Color Morale. I don't mind when bands do hope songs, but not when that's all they do. It gets overbearing.  I'm particularly fond of how The Amity Affliction handles it. They've kept their sound over the years while keeping it fresh, and their hope message is a lot more.... subtle, I guess. Their songs feel more like someone actually fighting through tough times and making it. Same with For All Those Sleeping <3. They didn't have many outright ""uplifting"" songs, but the ones they did were still them, and fit their mould.  Final note (On The Word Alive specifically), I do really enjoy the song ""Never Forget"" by The Word Alive. Makes me think of my Grandma. And their latest album does have a couple pretty heavy songs on it. It was an enjoyable album, to say the most. Nothing amazing, but definitely listenable."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,nohitter21,8,Tue Jul 21 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this and Apologies by MMI"
Metalcore,3dxvz3,kindodeku4,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"Monuments was way better than Apologies. What were you listening too? Granted Apologies is a great album, but Monuments is a developed and tighter version of Apologies."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,nohitter21,4,Mon Jul 20 20:33:48 2015 UTC,I think Apologies is much heavier and more interesting to listen to.
Metalcore,3dxvz3,kindodeku4,-5,Mon Jul 20 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"...yeah, that seriously doesn't make sense. Monuments is literally Apologies but with slightly better song writing and with better shitty cleans. Monuments may ""not be as heavy,"" that's just nit-picking. Opinons, ugh."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Exoseifer,7,Mon Jul 20 20:45:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about Monuments, but the way you said it makes you seem like an asshole. Lighten up."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,kindodeku4,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:40 2015 UTC,oh really? shit not again.
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Snaketicus93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:28 2015 UTC,The only song I really didn't like on Deceiver was 2012 only because of that one keyboard-ish part early on. I'm sorry if it's a poor reason for disliking the song but I just couldn't get into it. I love the rest of the album though.
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,2,Tue Jul 21 01:38:45 2015 UTC,What? Did they break up?
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Blwood13,9,Mon Jul 20 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"The music they are making now is not similar to this at all. They went the ""hopecore"" route instead of sticking to this style of metalcore."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"Can you describe ""Hopecore""? Never heard that term yet, and I've heard most. I do know that I really liked Deceiver but the one after that (Life Cycles I think?) I wasn't a massive fan of. It's a shame too because they are awesome musicians and they guitarists can sweep like mofos."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Blwood13,5,Mon Jul 20 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"""hopecore"" is the stuff like the new OM&M, WCAR, and the ""Life Cycles"" album. the lyrics focus on self improvement, positive outlooks, and a general catering to the younger, mostly female section of the fanbase. It tends to be less heavy and more ""inspirational"" than other metalcore"
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, so it's largely lyric-based? I haven't heard WCAR's latest 2, though I did hear both OM&M's latest album (decent) and the deluxe bonus tracks off that album (not great). Just from the name ""Hopecore"", I was thinking like Being as an Ocean."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Zaxl,4,Mon Jul 20 18:15:46 2015 UTC,The Color Morale is the best example of hopecore. Especially their most two recent albums. Although they've been doing it mostly since they started
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Thousand_Eyes,4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but even they softened up from when they started. I don't think it's part of the ""hope"" ideal, especially because both TCM and WCAR had that style of lyrics their entire careers"
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Zaxl,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true. I really miss Garret's lows on their first two albums :( not a fan of his new style of screaming very much.
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"Don't like the new vocals as much either. I'll tell you what though, the new lows are that much more enjoyable just because he uses them way less."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"I dunno if I'd say they softened up. The production definitely isn't as thick and the vocals aren't as clear cut or heavy, but the music itself is a lot more complicated and proggy (there's even some blast beats in one of the songs)."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,Thousand_Eyes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"That's a very valid explanation actually. I could never really put my finger on it, but that explains a lot of why I don't think they're overly soft but not the same.  They do have their moments of softer points though"
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I know them very well. I do think the music got better with Know Hope actually.
Metalcore,3dxvz3,kindodeku4,4,Mon Jul 20 19:21:18 2015 UTC,Hopecore is not just lyrics and positive vibe. Each hopecore band has changed their sound to be more mainstream viable. That is Hopecore. I'd even consider BMTH Hopecore to a certain respect.

Metalcore,3dxvz3,Mikevercetti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:04 2015 UTC,Wcar definitely isn't what they used to be. But their new album isn't terrible.
Metalcore,3dxvz3,nohitter21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"No, they just suck now."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,kindodeku4,0,Mon Jul 20 17:00:58 2015 UTC,really... they always sucked in my opinion. They were subpar to any good metalcore band back in 2010.
Metalcore,3dxvz3,luckynmbrsev,0,Mon Jul 20 20:40:56 2015 UTC,They shouldve kept craig :(
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,4,Mon Jul 20 18:02:48 2015 UTC,Awesome song. I remember finding this band back when they just had 2 EPs out. Battle Royale was my favorite song by them (had heard it on that Tap Tap Revenge game). They started teasing this album for a while and I think this song was released as the first single. I loved it (I usually don't get into singles very much).
Metalcore,3dxvz3,nohitter21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:10 2015 UTC,They had 2 EPs?
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a self titled and Empire. I didn't know about the self titled until Deceiver was already out, where as when I discovered them, I knew about Empire (it was their latest release at the time)."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,nohitter21,2,Tue Jul 21 04:54:09 2015 UTC,"Just googled it and wow, honestly never had heard about it."
Metalcore,3dxvz3,bearkin1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:56:06 2015 UTC,"Though it's old, it's still alright. It's worth checking out. I believe Craig Mabbit was the vocalist at the time (current Escape the Fate vocalist) and got booted later for being too busy with other stuff."

Metalcore,3e1f24,Ren-Ren,4,Tue Jul 21 05:31:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I'd count In This Moment as metalcore  I only know some of their new stuff tho, so I could be wrong."
Metalcore,3e1f24,Chriscassi13,2,Tue Jul 21 07:49:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of their old stuff is definitely metalcore, I posted something before but it got removed.   From the new album you can probably say Sick Like Me and Big Bad Wolf are the only metalcore tracks.   I'd agree with what /u/imacompletetool said on how they're basically a female MiW."
Metalcore,3e1f24,Mewzen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:20 2015 UTC,I like to think of them as a slightly upbeat female version of MiW. Some good songs!
Metalcore,3e1f24,iamacompletetool,3,Tue Jul 21 08:24:08 2015 UTC,"When they first started (Maria was, and still is, so damn hot), they were definitly metalcore. Their albuns are kinda meh, but they have some great songs."
Metalcore,3e1f24,Jorgetime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"I never really got into their first album, but I've listened to their second album quite a bit. But their third album, A Star-Crossed Wasteland, is fucking awesome in my opinion. It felt like they finally found a good balance between heavy and catchy and Maria had really found the range for her vocals. Then they threw it all away with their two most recent albums, they just got super boring and watered down and Maria totally changed her vocal style for the worse in my opinion."
Metalcore,3dyvfc,iammatteo,6,Mon Jul 20 17:29:14 2015 UTC,I fucking love this song but I need new material from these guys
Metalcore,3dyvfc,I_Nut_In_Butts,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:05 2015 UTC,Just saw them last night. Absolutely incredible band

Metalcore,3e0ghi,sugarscoops,11,Tue Jul 21 00:26:53 2015 UTC,Nightmare but not Waking the Fallen? That's kinda weird. I would definitely recommend WtF.

Metalcore,3e0ghi,VicinityGhost,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:29:07 2015 UTC,Waking the Fallen was the album that got me in to metalcore
Metalcore,3e0ghi,moshlyfe,7,Tue Jul 21 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"I dont know why but I burst out laughing when I saw Someday Came Suddenly. It's okay, I bought it too.  Definitely try to get into old metalcore. Zao, As I Lay Dying, Converge, Botch, Killswitch Engage, Earth Crisis, etc. You need Converge's Jane Doe in there."
Metalcore,3e0ghi,Runeon12,3,Tue Jul 21 00:32:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, I was 12 and carefree!  Converge and Botch are both on my list. I'll give it all a try. Thanks!"
Metalcore,3e0ghi,thesewordsarefake,6,Tue Jul 21 00:54:15 2015 UTC,"You should definitely get Witness by Blessthefall as well as more August Burns Red albums. Also Sleepwalking by Memphis May Fire, it's arguably their best work."
Metalcore,3e0ghi,FourMakesTwoUNLESS,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:27 2015 UTC,I had Messengers for a while but took it out. I've been working on getting back into ABR though. I'm trying to go backwards through their discography.  I'll definitely consider the other two as well!

Metalcore,3e0ghi,TheStormCallsYou,6,Tue Jul 21 15:45:15 2015 UTC,Underoath and the rest of August Burns Red's discography.
Metalcore,3e0ghi,Mars_vzx,6,Tue Jul 21 01:04:40 2015 UTC,Didn't see TDWP's Zombie EP or it's newer stuff. Definitely some good stuff you should try out. Also Fit For A King's Slave to Nothing has some good songs on it.

I would recommend earlier metalcore but I'm not too sure if you'd like it. Some bands I think you would like and you should check out are Every Time I Die and Code Orange. Once you like them, then it'd be easier to progress into older metalcore or the first bands I listed, bar Uunderoath."
Metalcore,3e0ghi,danielcore,3,Tue Jul 21 04:12:55 2015 UTC,"Architects are necessary. Listen to LF//LT first, and pretty much go backwards from there. I'd recommend every album of theirs besides Nightmares.  Edit: Check out Ice Nine Kills's album The Predator Becomes the Prey and if you like that, get Safe is Just a Shadow as well."
Metalcore,3e0ghi,jdizzleh3,3,Tue Jul 21 06:15:48 2015 UTC,"Converge, The Dillinger Eacape Plan, The Chariot; even early BTBAM or Protest the Hero wouldn't hurt"

The cover even got me more hyped for Space (which I didn't know was possible). I guess my only critique is basically the timing of the vocals, like when to sing and scream and what not.

Metalcore,3dy571,kindodeku4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. To Plant a Seed was my favorite album when it came out. Since then their albums have just gotten progressively more generic and stale.   I've tried multiple times to listen to their Self Titled of recent, and I can't even get through the entire thing. It isn't even in the same universe as To Plant a Seed. The entire thing is radio-rock and sounds like a bad Linkin Park rip-off."

I was such a huge fan of Shayley (I have a thing for clean singers), and after he left the band I really just didn't think any of the songs had the same impact.   Shayley started a solo project though, the band is called Dayshell. I really like it, but it still feels incomplete. It's like the other half of today's Of Mice and Men.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRKDihJgA58 Dayshell - Share With Me"

Metalcore,3dy571,thesewordsarefake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:48 2015 UTC,That's what the album would've sounded like without Matty. It was finished when chase left they just hadn't tracked vocals iirc. Totally agree on the ep though.
Metalcore,3dy571,whosthatmaninthemask,22,Tue Jul 21 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"I actually think once Aaron Gillespie left Underoath, it started to end. I can't get into Disambiguation. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it has a much different feel from their previous three albums, which imo are greats. Maybe i'm weird, but I also think Lost in the Sound of Separation is their best album, so there's that."
Metalcore,3dy571,I_Love_America17,5,Mon Jul 20 14:39:53 2015 UTC,"Personally I think Disambiguation is their best album, along with Lost in the Sound. Spencer has amazing cleans and the music in Disambiguation is top-notch."
Metalcore,3dy571,whosthatmaninthemask,3,Mon Jul 20 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. Musically it's very good. Spencer had found another part of a great voice, making him one of the best in the genre. But it's missing part of the heart of the other three, imho."
Metalcore,3dy571,Reptar_1221,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"Having just gotten into Underoath in the past few months, I think Lost in the Sound of Separation is easily their best album followed by They're Only Chasing Safety. Define the Great Line is good and has some amazing songs, but as a whole I love the other two way way more."
Metalcore,3dy571,whosthatmaninthemask,2,Mon Jul 20 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"I had a friend in the same boat as you. We went to see them live and the whole time he was just so on the fence about the band without Aaron. He wanted to keep liking them so much, but just couldn't get into it anymore.   I personally never listened to them much, but for him I will say RIP old Underoath"

Metalcore,3dy571,MavericK_96,6,Tue Jul 21 09:35:50 2015 UTC,"Although they are still my favorite band, I miss the Messengers//Constellations style August Burns Red. Everything after Constellations was just meh. Even the newest album. I'm tired of the slowed down interludes in almost every single song, and how washed up it all sounds. I'd love for them to go back to a ""heavier"" sound. Don't get me wrong, I still love everything they have, but I just can't get into it nearly as much. Messengers and Constellations are widely seen as their best albums.  And I know they aren't really ""metalcore"" but I wish Sleeping With Sirens would stop doing what they're doing and go back to the ""With Ears To See and Eyes To Hear"" style."
Metalcore,3dy571,MavericK_96,11,Mon Jul 20 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"For me it was Kingdom of Giants. I loved their first EP, especially their clean singer. The singer had the voice of a god, and didn't use any correction(which I find hard to find in this genre). Their songs always brought out emotions, and to me, thats the most important part in music. Unfortunately for me, their sound changed as they progressed passed that EP, and I believe the original clean singer couldn't stay with the band. I just coudln't get into their new stuff. I still have their band shirt that I wear all the time, and Stephen Rezza (the singer) tweeted me a few times, which meant a lot to me back in the day.   I still support them, and suggest you all listen to any of their songs, but for me, it seems nothing will be better than their first EP.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OaI0_H64YQ Kingdom of Giants - Watch Me, Abominable EP"

Metalcore,3dy571,Skyed64,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"Man, that was my favorite band back in 9th grade. They were one of the bands that made me realize that chugging and overused synths was lame. I was really upset when the clean vocalist left to pursue his R&B career (which I haven't heard any of) and when Every Wave Of Sound came out.  However, their latest album really restored my faith in their sound. It no longer sounds like the singer is trying to sing parts written by somebody else and it's much more tailored to his voice."

Metalcore,3dy571,Zaxl,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:39 2015 UTC,Linkin Park was my favorite band for so long when I was a kid. I pretty much gave up on them after I didn't really like Minutes to Midnight and New Divide came out. But then one day I thought I would listen to their new stuff for what it is (not the nu-metal Linkin Park I knew and loved) and WOW I love their new material. A Thousand Suns is my favorite album post Meteora personally.
Metalcore,3dy571,DistanceSkater,3,Mon Jul 20 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love their first two albums to death, and I thought Minutes was really solid but it wasn't quite on the same level. When A Thousand Suns came out I was so disappointed cause it was so different. I recently went back and gave it another serious listen and holy crap. It's definitely really different from everything else they've done, but the vision for that album is just amazing. The story that they build and the way that all the instruments just fit together, I have a whole new view of that album now. I thought Living Things was okay, there's a few decent tracks, but overall it's probably their worst effort in my opinion. And then Hunting Party was a pretty awesome surprise considering it's a sort of return to their old style, but mixing it with their new sound. I also love the hardcore influences on it. I heard in an interview recently that Mike was really inspired on The Refused at the time of recording."

It usually means you're being lame or dumb. The dictionary itself says it's to express dislike for someone, which is pretty accurate as well. It's just one of many generic insults.

Words are just a form of communication. Words themselves don't hurt, it's the meaning behind it. You don't have to say certain words to be hurtful.

Honestly, I'm disgusted that whatever band did this called Attila homophobes. That's what is fucked up here. Unless you have cold hard evidence that they are homophobic, you do not go around throwing out accusations like that. You are not homophobic for saying the word 'fag' unless you explicitly use it to discriminate against a gay person.   Language is amazing because we can assign completely different meanings to words based on how they are used. Context is fucking everything and people are incapable of understanding that.   All that being said, Fronz should not be saying it in front of thousands of people regardless just for the sake of respect. I know a few gay people who don't want to hear the word at all around them (even in a non-discriminatory context) and when you have an audience, you should avoid things like that just out of respect. Metal shows should be a place where you feel safe. You might get knocked around in the pit, but someone will almost always help you back up.

I get that to some ""fag"" isn't just a word but rather something that's incredibly hateful and vicious, but I grew up where ""fag"" and ""gay"" were used as synonyms for stupid. That's partly why I don't get offended by their usage but also because I don't care what people have to say about me. Even if those using it are trying to be completely hateful, it's just water off a ducks back to me.         As for the depression thing, I highly doubt the insults caused it.

Metalcore,3dwnhj,2_much_shibe,10,Mon Jul 20 05:41:22 2015 UTC,That is such a shitty comparison.
Metalcore,3dwnhj,Silivin,6,Mon Jul 20 06:42:02 2015 UTC,Nigger and fag/faggot are not the same at all.
Metalcore,3dwnhj,trilogique,-7,Mon Jul 20 06:19:38 2015 UTC,They're both derogatory words used to discriminate a certain group of people.
Metalcore,3dwnhj,theBOSpaladin,6,Mon Jul 20 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"They are not. Nigger is a word that exists solely to discriminate against a race. It has no purpose other than to be racist.   Faggot, on the other hand, has multiple meanings. When you call someone a faggot between your friends or whatever, you are (hopefully) not calling them homosexual, as if to say that being homosexual is bad. Oftentimes, when someone says ""you're being a faggot"", they're saying you're being lame, dumb etc. Its meaning is understood by the context of which it is used. So someone who is clearly homophobic that says fag or faggot probably means it as discrimination. When you hear it online or with your friends, they probably don't mean that. The word has essentially evolved, by way of online gaming and forums mostly, to mean something else.  Language is not static. Words change over time based on usage. An example: the word 'literally'. Because people misused it so much, we updated the definition to be both an exaggeration (e.g. ""I'm literally dead right now."") and literal (e.g. ""That's literally what happened.""). Colloquialisms, slang etc are particularly vulnerable because they are entirely decided by usage, but it can effectively happen to any word.  So unless society can create an alternate meaning for the word nigger and also being accepting of it, they are not the same. My guess is that will never happen. What I will say, though, is that faggot/fag are becoming increasingly taboo as society becomes more involved with gay rights, equality etc so I would not be surprised to see go the way of the dodo in the future. Personally, I agree with the movement to make the word unacceptable (it's not even in my vocabulary anyway so what do I care?), but it's also none of my business to police what people say."

I mean it really is offensive to the lgbtq community it may not be to us who consider ourselves straight but to others it really is offensive. Saying ""don't be offended so easily"" doesn't make a terrible derogatory slang word for a homosexual any better. Imagine if Fronz instead was dropping the n word in his songs, don't you think the black community would be offended? I mean I'm not a fan of Fronz and I think he is kind of obnoxious, but its not cool man. I don't hate the guy or anything but ever heard of the phrase think before you speak?

I think like half a year ago or so, Buddy did some sort of podcast on this online podcast show. It was like an hour long and I listened to it at work. At some point he started talking about how he was so effed up at one point, while questioning his sexuality, he could go pay trannies to bone him from behind (can't remember if they were transsexuals or transvestites). Maybe I'll try to find the source after I'm done my lunch here (don't rely on me though, I may not be able to find it).  For that reason, I was kind of skeptical when he came out as gay. Based on what I've heard from him, it's not as simple as that.

Metalcore,3dwnhj,tylrg,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"He very well could. Rap artist frequently use it. But then people will be offended because he is not black but he is saying a word with such historical and racial ties. And based on that argument could gays say fag? I clearly agree that fag should not be used in a derogatory manner but Fronz wasn't actually calling gay people gay. Therefore gay people have no business in being ""boo hoo ass bitches""."
Metalcore,3dwnhj,moshlyfe,3,Mon Jul 20 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"So, in other words, he's telling gay people not to be offended by a word that has been used to offend gays for decades. makes sense. as for him using the n word, I want to know why he doesn't, not that he ""can""."
Metalcore,3dwnhj,tylrg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:03:00 2015 UTC,"I dont think he should say either but that doesn't mean he can't. He is a free man.

Metalcore,3dwnhj,yourflyisajar,3,Mon Jul 20 08:24:48 2015 UTC,"I was at the show saturday in MD. Right after Attila, the Wonder Years played and lead singer, Dan Campbell called out Attila for being ""homophobic"" and ""disrespectful"" on stage after they played a song. He went on a quick rant which was a bit too whiney for me. I mean literal high pitched whines that you would use to mock a teenage girl. Basically he trashed Attila 5 mins after Attila played.   Love Attila or hate them, seemed kinda lame to trash a another band to pump up your own crowd. Not to mention, more than HALF of the crowd headed home after Attila played. I'm a bit biased in favor of Attila so take what I say with a grain of salt, but Dan Campbell's rant seemed kinda self-righteous. I'm not sure what's going on behind the stage but it needs to stay there. No need for Fronz to stoke the flames on twitter either. Play up your persona and move on."
Metalcore,3dwnhj,shipwrecked9,6,Mon Jul 20 13:49:21 2015 UTC,"I can assure you that Dan ""Soupy"" Campbell wasn't trashing Attila to pump up his own crowd. I doubt many fans of The Wonder Years care for Attila. I couldn't care less for Attila. One of my sisters is friends with Nate who left them. Plus, wouldn't calling out Attila play into the persona they have cultivated for themselves?    Soupy calls people out when he thinks what they are saying is wrong, disrespectful, or bigoted. For example, when he called out Matty Mullins for slut-shaming. Soupy isn't self-righteous, he just chooses to speak when he sees and hears a problem. The Wonder Years started out kind of as a joke band as well. But then they grew up, saw things from a different point of view, and their songs reflect that.    When you are on the stage, you have a literal platform to speak and have people listen to you. You can either have a positive or negative impact on someone. What comes across as ""whining"" is just people being sick and tired of having to hear bullshit day after day after fucking day."
Metalcore,3dwnhj,yourflyisajar,4,Mon Jul 20 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt he meant what he said. He trashed Attila and Attila's fans during the rant though. It's one thing to say something like ""we dont need substances to have a good time!"" or whatever instead of saying, and I'm paraphrasing what Soupy said, ""Fuck those guys, they're homophobic, trashy, and disrespectful. You guys arent like that!"" along with a few more expletives directed at Attila. It was emotionally charged which probably explains his high pitched rant.   I understand that bands have the stage to speak their mind, but why escalate a fued after another band's performance and alienate a fanbase during your set? Attila never mentioned The Wonder Years or any other band during their set yet TWY took a shot at Attila the first chance they got. Like something behind the scenes boiled over onto the stage. Seemed disrespectful, something you labeled Attila as. The crowd immediately afterwards was a mix of cheers and oooooh's like Soupy ""burned"" Attila.   I understand if Attila plays the role of the villain, they're gonna receive animosity, but its like TWY took the low road on saturday."
Metalcore,3dwnhj,shipwrecked9,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"All criticism can be seen as disrespectful. But that is not to say everything is equal.    I think Attila wouldn't have had a problem with TWY to bring up during their set. It was only when Soupy said his piece that there was a problem worth talking about. Soupy called them out on stage, Chris came back on Twitter. I would say that speaking out on stage isn't the low road, but that's my take. I think what Soupy has a problem with is more about how Attila carry themselves, their behavior on stage and as a band, and the content of their songs.    To be fair though, TWY have their share of shitty fans (this is coming from one show experience, as a caveat). But don't all bands? I went to see them in Atlanta last spring and there were a bunch of dudes just starting a pit and starting shit. At a show by TWY. It was unnecessary. Plus, listening to some people talk at the show, TWY have some ignorant fans. Not a majority or even a considerable minority, but enough.    No one is really completely innocent, but it's more important what you're actively working for, what you're saying, and how you carry yourself as a band."

Fronz has no problem with people being upset with him, and if he did offend anyone and they came up to him and told him he would probably apologize. The issue he has with this is two fold I think, one that someone accused him of being homophobic not to his face, and two that they brought his band members into this. The point of using the word faggot is to offend people, because he was called that as a kid, he wants people to get angry, that's the point of Attilla."

Metalcore,3dwo5c,I_Nut_In_Butts,5,Mon Jul 20 05:55:02 2015 UTC,"I use to love his videos, he always made interviews different and interesting somehow.  He turned into a generic clickbate YouTuber though unfortunately. Not nearly as good as he used to be."
Metalcore,3dwo5c,yoimjoe,5,Mon Jul 20 04:33:19 2015 UTC,"Never been a fan of him. I always felt like he wasted the interviews he had lined up—90% pointless fangirl questions. I wanna know about the artists, their music, their experience, stuff like that. I don't really care how they like their peanut butter."
Metalcore,3dwo5c,Trifax,5,Mon Jul 20 07:08:31 2015 UTC,he's annoying as fuck
Metalcore,3dwo5c,wbled,12,Mon Jul 20 08:18:51 2015 UTC,"Fuck him. I helped push him up to like 10,000 subscribers when he was barely at 1k, and then I ask him for a favor and he reads and ignores my message."
Metalcore,3dwo5c,ElmoTheRapist,4,Mon Jul 20 07:06:26 2015 UTC,annoying as foock lol
Metalcore,3dwo5c,FeelTripp,4,Mon Jul 20 06:03:09 2015 UTC,Stopped caring after Black Veil Brides interview number 743845987.  Way too cringe and fangirlish for me
Metalcore,3dwo5c,furialel,3,Mon Jul 20 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"I sort of liked his quirky interviews. They were harmless and fun and pretty unique. However now all he does is post shitty, SHITTY, bands on his YT channel and dresses like some wannabe washed-out scene kid."
Metalcore,3dwo5c,Vcom561,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My problem is that now it's just him being an idiot with his friends. Its funny for them, but not us."

Metalcore,3dw9fk,LinkSinc,2,Mon Jul 20 01:37:29 2015 UTC,This band. If Craig would just leave ETF and focus on this i would be okay with that :)
Metalcore,3dw9fk,Imatomat,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:58 2015 UTC,"Duuuuude but have you heard ETF's new song ""Just a Memory""? They've played it live and it sounds amazing, completely blows this band away."

Metalcore,3dw9fk,Imatomat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess we'll need to wait for the song to be released to decide. It's just that TDR brings back the heaviness Craig used to have and that ETF song sounds pretty heavy, at least for an ETF song haha. Either way, Craig is still awesome."
Metalcore,3dw9fk,2paymentsof19_95,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:50 2015 UTC,Right? His vocals on this are top notch. Especially the screams.

Metalcore,3dxone,Svad,2,Mon Jul 20 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"At first I thought wow, that is not bad but then it got quite boring when it was just breakdown after breakdown.  The vocalist has some sick lows though and the opening/ending breakdown sounds interesting."
Metalcore,3dwpyl,SMaddox50,2,Mon Jul 20 04:10:43 2015 UTC,I have so much love for these guys. Been a fan since A Snow Capped Romance. Their latest offering is my favourite metalcore album this year
Metalcore,3dwpyl,new_zealand,2,Mon Jul 20 06:50:58 2015 UTC,One of the best comebacks of this year.
Metalcore,3dyrdd,iamacompletetool,3,Mon Jul 20 17:01:11 2015 UTC,Love this band

Metalcore,3dyrdd,SMaddox50,0,Mon Jul 20 19:39:50 2015 UTC,Yes I did. It was generic as fuck no redeeming qualities.
Metalcore,3dv0r9,ManTheWombat,2,Sun Jul 19 19:13:03 2015 UTC,This stuff is great but I don't see why people hate on their atmospheric stuff. It's all good.

Metalcore,3dv0r9,DevonWontGoToHeaven,-10,Sun Jul 19 23:43:57 2015 UTC,As in R.I.P. when they were good.
Metalcore,3dv0r9,nicktheman2,3,Mon Jul 20 00:55:23 2015 UTC,"Hollow crown is my favourite album by them but it doesn't mean they got shit, what do up you dislike about LF / LT?"
Metalcore,3dv0r9,DevonWontGoToHeaven,0,Mon Jul 20 01:11:05 2015 UTC,Lol everyone just completely forgets about Daybreaker when that was their best album.
Metalcore,3dv0r9,Informalmoose3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:23 2015 UTC,It was a good album but it had nothing on the ones I mentioned
Metalcore,3dv0r9,DevonWontGoToHeaven,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"They went way too much into the generic metalcore direction. They dropped any tech/math influences they had after Hollow Crown. Also over-use of clean vocals. It's far better than a lot of modern metalcore imo, but I just cant see them as the same Architects."
Metalcore,3dv0r9,nicktheman2,7,Mon Jul 20 01:36:26 2015 UTC,overuse of cleans on LF/LT? they use kind of a pitch-screaming style vocal but i can't recall any actual cleans on that album. they used it on some of their older stuff though...  if cleans are your problem i don't think LF/LT is the culprit
Metalcore,3dv0r9,marswithrings,3,Mon Jul 20 02:00:10 2015 UTC,Castles in the Air
Metalcore,3dv0r9,megustcizer,4,Mon Jul 20 04:21:43 2015 UTC,oh no. they used some cleanish vocals on the last minute of one song. WHOLE ALBUM IS SHIT
Metalcore,3dv0r9,marswithrings,4,Mon Jul 20 04:56:15 2015 UTC,Was just pointing out that cleans were actually used on the album. The ending chorus of CITA is one of my favorite moments of the album.
Metalcore,3dv0r9,megustcizer,2,Mon Jul 20 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"...uhm. but then i don't understand what the problem is – you're accusing the album of overusing clean vocals, but the best example of it is actually not a problem?"
Metalcore,3dv0r9,marswithrings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:15 2015 UTC,Which happens to be one of the good songs?

Metalcore,3duqkl,Runeon12,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"Huh the Wikipedia page for the album says he's featured in the song, but I mean Wikipedia's also been horribly wrong before so take it for what it's worth"
Metalcore,3duqkl,TheTimeIsNine,2,Sun Jul 19 21:27:41 2015 UTC,I could be wrong as well though! Totally possible!
Metalcore,3duqkl,BestTastingFish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"He was on the actual song as well.

Metalcore,3duqkl,oktofeellost,2,Sun Jul 19 21:52:06 2015 UTC,What's the deal with that? I know they're still together. Are they going to tour again at some point?
Metalcore,3duqkl,NEfan61,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"No idea, and that's what kills me. It's been a long time since I've even heard of anything new with them which is a shame because their last two EPs were sick."
Metalcore,3duqkl,oktofeellost,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:56 2015 UTC,Right!? I wanted a tour for those so bad.  I was wondering if independently producing those backfired on them
Metalcore,3duqkl,AsGoodAsDeader,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:07 2015 UTC,Doubtful. They all got real jobs and all that good stuff.  They throw together three to four local shows a year but that's the most I ever hear from them. It's kinda nice being able to rage with the other 30 people that show up and then kick back with the band for a bit though haha. Crazy how big they were here locally for the longest time and now it's like they don't even exist.
Metalcore,3duqkl,new_zealand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:59:50 2015 UTC,Yep. Now I'm sad. Arizona is a bit too far for me to drive.

Metalcore,3dvvk2,PhysicsSaysNo,2,Mon Jul 20 02:50:11 2015 UTC,Shit really? I spent $20 on it at their merch tent yesterday.
Metalcore,3dvvk2,naughtynuns69,3,Mon Jul 20 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was shocked at the price. It's a great documentary though."

But I paid for the bundle and had it shipped from Australia. $40 for a t-shirt and DVD, plus $20 in shipping... Was insane.

Metalcore,3duvcs,endingonagoodnote,8,Sun Jul 19 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"The leak sounds like shit (on the previously unreleased songs at least) but I fell in love with Animate instantly. What an amazing song. So either wait for Rise/UNFD to upload at least a decent version of the songs, or wait for release, yeah this definitely won't top Singularity for me but I really enjoyed it on my first playthrough.  UNLESS we're not talking about the leak but about the 5 released songs so far. Really like Rot and Impulse out of those 5."
Metalcore,3duvcs,Dwesk,4,Sun Jul 19 20:31:22 2015 UTC,yeah the leak quality is pathetic...kinda takes away from the overall experience imo
Metalcore,3duvcs,moshlyfe,7,Sun Jul 19 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"I've had ""rot"" stuck in my head for almost a week now.  Good stuff in my opinion, but I am a drummer; so I tend to listen closer to rhythm in music more then others.  Their drummer is a beast."

Metalcore,3duvcs,sneezingcat18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:04 2015 UTC,"I love their bassist, the songs aren't the same without him and the drummer."
Metalcore,3duvcs,Hawnzor,22,Mon Jul 20 00:50:37 2015 UTC,I don't get the hate for it as it's by no means bad music but it honestly just feels really flat compared to the previous releases. The drops don't feel as big and the guitar tone sounds a little more fuzzy or washed out to my untrained ears.
Metalcore,3duvcs,zeroshark,13,Sun Jul 19 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"I love it a lot. It's not Discoveries or Singularity, but I still love it."
Metalcore,3duvcs,counterparts69,19,Sun Jul 19 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I couldn't get into Northlane until Marcus came along. Love the new tracks, can't wait to get the rest."
Metalcore,3duvcs,Synystermuskrat,6,Sun Jul 19 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"Same, although I do appreciate them a lot more since Marcus has joined the band and have actually gotten into to more of their older stuff as well. I think the new album is great to be honest."
Metalcore,3duvcs,geoffreythehamster,5,Mon Jul 20 00:48:47 2015 UTC,"Same for me. He's the reason I got into the band. Heck, I flew interstate just to see them perform live with Marcus. This Northlane is the band I fell in love with. I love their older work too (which I only got into because Marcus got me interested in the band and I wanted to learn the songs to their setlist), but I also understand that that band is no more.      As long as you understand that this is essentially a different band, it's fine. Going into this thinking that it will be anything like their previous work (especially when they stated they a didn't want an Adrian rip-off for auditions) is only going to set yourself up for disappointment. Marcuslane is the future and I am 100% on board."
Metalcore,3duvcs,boganhobo,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:52 2015 UTC,Pretty much the same for me.
Metalcore,3duvcs,Snaketicus93,15,Sun Jul 19 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"Not good. I really don't like Marcus' voice and with how light the songs have gotten, I'm completely put off by it. Honestly doubt I'll even listen to the album when it's released."
Metalcore,3duvcs,nohitter21,3,Sun Jul 19 19:03:01 2015 UTC,the only song i liked was rot :/
Metalcore,3duvcs,FeelTripp,5,Mon Jul 20 00:38:53 2015 UTC,Not a fan...leech is the only one I like. I got into them because of adrians lows and cleans. Not the same
Metalcore,3duvcs,sneezingcat18,3,Sun Jul 19 20:11:46 2015 UTC,Agreed. Adrian just fit so much better than Marcus does.
Metalcore,3duvcs,lAbstractedl,7,Sun Jul 19 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"IMO Marcus is a very good replacement ,its just very difficult to top Adrian."

Metalcore,3duvcs,sneezingcat18,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I just can't get into his style. He's good. By no means am I saying he's a bad vocalist, he just doesn't have the grit that Adrian did for me."
Metalcore,3duvcs,lAbstractedl,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:55 2015 UTC,"Personally I like Marcus ,not as much as Adrian , but I know what you mean about that grit that Adrian had. It sounded as if his vocals were angry and mean with a (fuck you attitude) followed by lyrics that were poetic. Marcus feels a little too conservative ,but his cleans are far better than Adrian's. So I guess I  have mixed feelings with ""New Northlane"""
Metalcore,3duvcs,MissMayIhelpyou,2,Mon Jul 20 00:52:10 2015 UTC,"I feel Marcus would be much more at home with a lighter band, but I think he does have the talent to keep Northlane badass."
Metalcore,3duvcs,lAbstractedl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:58 2015 UTC,"If you don't think of it in the same vein as Northlanes more aggressive releases, Node is pretty sweet. It's got a more chilled out, Deftones-y(?) vibe to it."
Metalcore,3duvcs,Sludgewaves,2,Sun Jul 19 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"I hate it, really just hate it. I don't know why but once they switched to Marcus it lost a lot of feeling. I miss the hard hitting waiting for the drop feeling. Plus Marcus is a good singer seriously the guy can sing but it uncleans even in his audition tape feel really weak to me and takes away from their live performances these days I feel."
Metalcore,3duvcs,coolbad96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:52:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like his uncleans are REALLY good, it's just really hard to like them when they're in the shadow of Adrian."

Metalcore,3duvcs,mitchusonfire,2,Mon Jul 20 09:40:59 2015 UTC,"I really like most of the released songs so far, but it's just not the Northlane which I love, if it was another band i'd be 100% fine with it. I get that the vocals are gonna be different, but i really miss the heavy guitars from the 2 last albums."
Metalcore,3duvcs,Shihska,5,Sun Jul 19 19:44:23 2015 UTC,"I've loved Northlane for a long time and I didn't think anyone could be as good as Adrian, but the second I heard Rot I thought they were 10 times better. Marcus is such a good vocalist and what I've heard off Node is amazing. Looking forward to the future, these lads are going to carry aussie Metalcore."
Metalcore,3duvcs,JGucci_,2,Sun Jul 19 20:00:33 2015 UTC,It's different. Doesn't mean it's bad but i wanted something different than node. Maybe i need more time listening into node..
Metalcore,3duvcs,McDjonty,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:46 2015 UTC,All these folks wishing they had Adrian back.   Did you guys ever see Northlane live with Adrian? Yeah he sounded good on CD but he was shocking live. Marcus is ten times better live that Adrian was.
Metalcore,3duvcs,HateResonates,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:54 2015 UTC,I think it's alright. I mean it's different from everything else that's being churned out which is a good thing I guess. I do wish they sounded a lot more like Singularity but I could still get into Node based on what we've heard so far.
Metalcore,3duvcs,Runeon12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Waiting for better quality of the whole album, but from all the songs they've put out I like it. It's different and I do miss old Northlane, but I enjoy the new sound."

Metalcore,3duvcs,top_KeK_420,2,Sun Jul 19 21:18:20 2015 UTC,labels send albums out to online reviewers shortly before release date so they can start writing up reviews. those reviewers (or whomever has access to those files as well) end up leaking the albums.
Metalcore,3duvcs,moshlyfe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:30:44 2015 UTC,Nahh but they've released like 5 songs I think

Marcus is by no means a bad vocalist and he does a great job on all of the old songs, but Node so far isn't the album I was expecting.  I preordered it nonetheless and I imagine it'll grow on me."
Metalcore,3duvcs,QueazyRager,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:46:04 2015 UTC,"Love it. It's different. I loved Adrian's music, and Marcus's has the same vibe with me. Just because he isn't an exact copy of Adrian, doesn't mean the band is destroyed. I love it."
Metalcore,3duvcs,TigersFan01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'm listening to it now and I think the entire product is flowing a lot better than the singles did (which is exactly what I thought would happen)  That being said, it's a little too dialed back for me. Marcus's cleans are beautiful, and his screams work well, but the instrumentation is just missing that bite that it had on their previous full lengths."
Metalcore,3duvcs,moshlyfe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"Not really a big fan of anything they've done before, but I am liking most of what I've heard off their new record so far."

Metalcore,3duvcs,KWCool13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:39 2015 UTC,I'm personally not a fan of it. It's okay but I just can't get I to it like discoveries and singularity

My favorite part about Northlane was their breakdown-heavy style of music. The drumming and low growls mixed just tickled my balls. From what I've heard so far, Rot is like the only song I can get behind.   Still going to reserve my final judgement until I get my pre-order but my hype has slowly died down."
Metalcore,3duvcs,I_Nut_In_Butts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:42:16 2015 UTC,It is SO good. The sounds and tones are all fresh and Marcus' vocals fit perfectly with the overall flow of the song.
Metalcore,3duvcs,ConvolutedBoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:37 2015 UTC,Album is good! The only thing that bums me out is that I was really looking forward to what they could do with Adrian after Singularity.  The only thing that is missing for me is all the crazy parts like the riffs in Scarab
Metalcore,3duvcs,KristapsCoCoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:17:40 2015 UTC,slow burner i think. is this version of rot supposed to be different? yet to listen to it.
Metalcore,3duvcs,mitchusonfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:42:10 2015 UTC,"Marcus can sing really well, but he's screams have only like one octave which kind of sucks. Maybe it's just how they're going with the instrumentals for this album but I wish it would be a lot more heavy.  I still like them but it's a pretty significant change from Singularity."

Metalcore,3duvcs,Plasticninja_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:02:51 2015 UTC,I'm personally very stoked on this album. Discoveries was a GREAT record and Singularity sounded considerably different but people still got behind it (imho one of the few records that won't be irrevelant in 10 years). You guys have to remember that a lot of these tracks were in the process of being written when Adrian was still in the band and I personally don't think any of these songs would have sounded as great because Adrian just wasn't that versatile (honest opinion). His screaming vocals were unreal and unparalleled but for the way this music is written it just doesn't call for that. Major kudos to Marcus for stepping it up on ridiculous short notice and absolutely delivering. This album is a breath of fresh air in a scene where chugging out breakdowns back to back and squashing tracks to hell and back are all too ubiquitous. Much respect to Northlane for trying to forge their own path.

Then Rot dropped and I loved it so I was really looking forward to their new direction, but every other song released so far just hasn't tickled my balls the same way, so they're back to being a band I'll jam every once in a while and other wise never listen to."

Metalcore,3dxur9,oscar9909,3,Mon Jul 20 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"I do, because largely their body of work is metalcore. And, even if their new direction is not a metalcore one, they still are one of the most influential metalcore bands around, so for that I will always consider them metalcore."
Metalcore,3dxur9,jesusofpaign,3,Mon Jul 20 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"Who cares what genre they are. Just enjoy the music and don't worry about having to categorize every band by genre. Bands don't sit down and think ""hmmm, we're going to write a strictly metalcore album."" They write what they feel like writing. As bands grow and mature their writing style changes."

Metalcore,3dxur9,mattdocks,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"But were talking about Metalcore. BMTH is moving away from metalcore for the most part and just becoming a ""metal"" band. A band like August Burns Red is a better example. They make still metalcore albums and are evolving as they move forward (for the most part). Also when you say mature, you mean going mainstream right? There's not a lot of metalcore bands that ""evolve"" and don't eventually move into buttrock."
Metalcore,3dxur9,kindodeku4,4,Mon Jul 20 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"Maturing does NOT mean going mainstream. August Burns Red has evolved an incredible amount since Messengers in 2007. But if you turn on the radio, you would never hear them. Evolving doesn't mean turning into ""buttrock."" It generally means a band has stronger songwriting and structure, and uses more diverse sounds in their music."
Metalcore,3dxur9,mattdocks,2,Mon Jul 20 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying evolving equals mainstream. Evolving isn't bad, I actually like it when a band evolves. But when bands don't do it right, they turn into buttrock and alienates their fans. And there has been a lot of bands recently that are getting worse when they ""evolve"". BMHT is actually more popular now than when they were metalcore because they always sucked. When they finally wised up to be original for once it really helped. Also, other bands like WCAR, OM&M, MMF, SWS, MMI, TWA etc. So many bands that were at the top of their game, just losing most of their old fans due to subpar work."

Metalcore,3dt2g9,camsmith328,8,Sun Jul 19 15:34:45 2015 UTC,I used to like Bryan's video back when he was some awkward white kid asking band members awkward questions.

I feel like they could promote up and coming local bands and fund a tour and then that band not only gets a little touring experience under their belt but they also get promotion. But then you would have to be judged on the performance of the music and not just the stage presence. If you did that then I am sure people would just copy bands like letlive., ETID, and Dillinger. Also I think it needs to be a mix of bands from all kinds of genres of the alternative/extreme music scene. It would reach a wider demographic due to the variety of music being presented. It would also have to be like a Hulu exclusive or be premiered on AP or something."

Metalcore,3dvria,TheKaiserBurkhart,5,Sun Jul 19 23:50:32 2015 UTC,Lyman is probably trying to avoid any more more bad publicity this Warped Tour. Not that I'm complaining that he seems to be taking steps.
Metalcore,3dvria,EliteCombine07,3,Mon Jul 20 01:04:15 2015 UTC,"I get it that he's trying to avoid bad publicity for Warped. Props to him for actually doing something about it.   But then again, he let Front Porch Step play on Warped despite all the controversy surrounding him."
Metalcore,3dvria,TheKaiserBurkhart,2,Mon Jul 20 01:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still can't get over how stupid the decision to let FPS play was.

Metalcore,3dvria,tylrg,8,Mon Jul 20 17:11:09 2015 UTC,OP is referring to the drama surrounding post-hardcore band Slaves fronted by Jonny Craig. You can read about it and their statement here.   The tl;dr of what Jonny Craig supposedly did is he apparently was drunk and sexually harassed their merch girl. Jonny & Slaves deny the claims.
Metalcore,3dvria,JohnWafflesBrown,2,Mon Jul 20 00:12:16 2015 UTC,Thank you. I had less than no idea what we were talking about.
Metalcore,3dvria,danny_fiasco,17,Mon Jul 20 01:41:14 2015 UTC,You have less then no idea what you are talking about.
Metalcore,3dvria,jdstiffler,-3,Sun Jul 19 23:49:44 2015 UTC,You never did answer the discussion questions like the others did. All you have to do is give your opinion on recent events and be respectful to others opinions.
Metalcore,3dvria,jdstiffler,6,Mon Jul 20 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"Here's a status I wrote today, it answers the question from my point of view:  A lot of people have asked me my opinion on the whole Johnny Craig fiasco with Slaves being kicked off the Warped Tour. Apparently I have some valuable insight as someone who has spent a few years on that tour and as someone who has been addicted, gone to rehab, etc. I don't know why you want my opinion, but here it is.  Addiction costs you everything. You have not experienced being truly addicted unless you would be willing to give, say or do ANYTHING to ANYONE to get your drug of choice. I've been there, I've experienced that desperation. My addiction cost me damn near everything. Friendships, family relationships, my health, my career opportunities with Beartooth, almost my marriage and almost my life.  I've been nine months sober by utilizing rehab, counsellors, psychiatrists and a shit load of self discipline and trying to just get back to where I was a few years ago has been the most exhausting and frustrating thing I've ever attempted. And I still have so far to go. Like, really far to go. Repairing the damage I've done is something that will take years to fix. You don't earn back trust overnight.  Why does this matter? This is why. The actions that were taken by Johnny Craig are simply not in line with the behaviors and actions of someone who is truly committed to changing their life and their future. When doctors and experts tell you not to drink because it is STATISTICALLY PROVEN to lead to relapse more often then not, if you were intent on following the path to sobriety you'd damn sure listen.  The alleged sexual assault and misconduct aside (because nobody really KNOWS what happened, minus those in the band) Johnny simply is not taking his sobriety seriously. As fans of his music, by continuing to support him while he makes the choices that he makes, you are doing nothing but enabling him by showing him that there are no consequences to his decisions.  I spent a few years on Warped with him, notably back in 2011 when he was in the major throws of his battle with heroin, and I honestly don't know if he's changed from the lying, stealing, patronizing man that he was, but from what I hear from those on the tour, he doesn't seem like he has.  Now I will add the disclaimer that I have not spoken to Johnny in a few years and he might have honestly turned things around for himself, but from what I see and hear - I just don't think that is the case."
Metalcore,3dvria,EliteCombine07,4,Mon Jul 20 01:30:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. It's obvious that addiction is a bitch even worse after. Glad you made it out the rough.
Metalcore,3dvria,jdstiffler,4,Mon Jul 20 01:39:36 2015 UTC,"Had a problem before but can manage yourself now   The continued use of secondary substances is a high risk situation for relapse. Being a heavy drinker after being in rehab for heroin is quite irresponsible.  If bands felt uncomfortable with Slaves being on tour, they had every right to voice their opinion, with the meeting being a way to express those opinions, which is the same thing that happened in the FPS situation. Ultimately the decision would of been Lyman's."

Also, iirc Compression on your Master Fader is insanely important, atleast in Pro Tools, because otherwise your bounced MP3 will come out insanely quiet. I hope I was right in that, I just woke up lol."
Metalcore,3dtpmk,kindodeku4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"This is such a deep subject you don't even realize. There is so many factors that the mixer has to think about when mixing. It's gonna take you a long time to be at least decent at mixing. I recommend just using Youtube and watch as many videos as possible. Also there is a Site called SoundOnSound that is a great reading source. Just use the vast knowledge of the internet to learn.  The Recording Revolution Channel is pretty great for starters: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjRzsiP_aDWWLHV4-2LKBtg  One of the simplest things you can do to make any mix sound pretty decent is to EQ and compress the tracks. Now do these incorrectly and it won't sound good. If you want to get better pretty quick, learning how to EQ and use Compression correctly will help any amateur mixer. And one last thing, never overpower a mix with lots of bass or treble. Your mix has to be even and clear. You need to hear all the instruments clearly, and the bass/mids/treble are not overpowering in the mix.  Also check out this Joey Sturgis Article, he's dead right on everything: http://performermag.com/the-4-elements-that-separate-a-good-mix-from-a-great-mix/  I use Pro Tools, which is the industry standard, but there is a DAW called Reaper that is free. it's not really ""pro,"" but it's got a lot of great features. If you have a Mac, I recommend Logic. It costs some money, but it is the cheapest Pro DAW.  Have fun learning. And if you find that you really like it, I recommend going to college to be an audio engineer and mixer. I just finished going to an audio engineering college and I would have never learned all the things I learned in college on my own. That said, college is still fucking expense.

We Came As Romans (Dave Stephens is awesome live and Kyle kinda sucks, but damn it it's hilarious watching him have fun crowd surfing on that boat.

Not any hanging upside down but more Stevis doing his crazy stuff and climbing all over the giant stacks of monitors at warped.

I have my favorites, just the same as everyone else, but they really close this album out heavily with the last two songs while retaining a progressive and experimental sound they've been shooting for."
Metalcore,3dqmtd,UncleJackkk,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:25 2015 UTC,I'm the same. Everlasting Ending because of Paul Waggoner
Metalcore,3dqmtd,mathcu,2,Sat Jul 18 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"its out for 1 week ? holy shit it feels much longer than that.  identity is by far my favourite, maybe my favourite abr song ever now. its so well build and so heavy i just orgasm everytime i listen to it.  can i say least favourite too, in hopes somebody convinces me whats good about that song ?  i cant listen to broken promises in its entirety. its so drawn out and long i cant take it anymore after that last breakdown, idk i want to like it but i just cant"

Metalcore,3dqmtd,rsk_blue,2,Sat Jul 18 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and pick my three favorite songs so far from Found in Far Away Places.  My first favorite being Identity. This teaser for the album really got me excited for this album when it was first being announced. The breakdown in it is amazing and I also for some reason really love the line ""My entire life, I was dealt the wrong hand."" I can just really connect to just that single line alone.  Next, I'm gonna have to go with Vanguard. I really love that electronic intro that kicks into the song.  And for the third song I'll pick Martyr because I love all of the tapping in that song especially in the end.And because of those Dustin screams."
Metalcore,3dqmtd,cockstem,2,Sat Jul 18 17:45:24 2015 UTC,Marathon. That breakdown. I cannot wrap my head around what time signature/ rhythm they use and it absolutely blows my mind.
Metalcore,3dqmtd,cockstem,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:50:30 2015 UTC,Yeah dude. Matt switches to the upbeat on the China and my mind just explod
Metalcore,3dqmtd,greatsc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:37 2015 UTC,I'm convinced Matt is one of the greatest drummers we've ever heard.
Metalcore,3dqmtd,Shepherd7X,2,Sat Jul 18 18:33:51 2015 UTC,In no particular order:  21 Grams  Broken promises  Marathon  Separating the Seas  Ghosts  Majoring in the Minors  ...dang. That barely narrowed it down at all.
Metalcore,3dqmtd,iammatteo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:17:14 2015 UTC,Everlasting Ending for me too. The guitar work is incredible!
Metalcore,3dqmtd,Skyed64,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"Identity, The Wake, and Vanguard."
Metalcore,3dqmtd,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:27:58 2015 UTC,Broken Promises; the opening riff is so good.
Metalcore,3dqmtd,ShyfterEU,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:22 2015 UTC,Separating the Seas is pretty great. Has the classic and new ABR sounds blended into one nice and super catchy package.
Metalcore,3dqmtd,Thoketan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:18:44 2015 UTC,I still haven't been able to listen to the whole album more than once but for now I'd say The Wake.
Metalcore,3dqmtd,englishmuffyn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"The songs I keep going back to listen to are Majoring in the Minors and Vanguard.  Some people talk about how jarring the interlude of MitM is, but I really dig the sound and feel. Plus it flows majestically if you listen to the acoustic version on the deluxe issue. Spotify that junk if you haven't heard it yet.  Vanguards has yet to fail to get me going. Every time I hear that intro I just get ready, then I'm ready to bounce of the walls and destroy my room in a private mosh party. It slows down almost too much, but then comes back.   I actually hate Ghosts. The cleans...they kill me. Thats the true jarr on the record. Perhaps it's just not something I expect from ABR, as I dont mind cleans on other bands (see Silent Planet and Phinehas for cleans that are basically the same idea, but I can enjoy/sing along with) so that could be it.  Overall I'm gonna keep listening to the album and see what comes from it. Still jamming Phinehas hardcore though."
Metalcore,3dqmtd,deadwrongallalong,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:01:02 2015 UTC,"Everlasting Ending because the 'screamy cleans' (Bravery will find you, don't let me down, etc) are always a great touch on an already great ABR song (see Echoes) plus the guitars are great. Lyrics are pretty powerful as well. Ghosts is a close second because of the intro and the outro."
Metalcore,3dqmtd,newschoolerz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:34:17 2015 UTC,"Ghosts is definitely my most favourite. I like the lyrics and love Jeremy's clean vocals and how the song gets more intense as it goes on.. I get chills every time.  My other favourite songs are Everlasting Ending (I love the way the guitar transitions/fades out at the end), Twenty One Grams, and Marathon. I just like the way they sound, and the fact that they don't have an interlude in the middle. Oh, and I almost forgot Majoring in the Minors (Reprise) - oddly enough I enjoy it much more than the regular version."
Metalcore,3dqmtd,JGucci_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"Reprise is definitely better. You can hear the great guitar melody a couple minutes in really well, while on the normal record it's kind of overpowered by vocals. And the interlude sounds much more at home in the reprise"

Metalcore,3dpl5k,AbandontheKing,10,Sat Jul 18 05:31:14 2015 UTC,Oh man. Love this album. The high vocals in Alpha Seed (2:40) and the insane djenty shreds in Dementia (47:52) are my personal highlights.
Metalcore,3dpl5k,havoktheorem,6,Sat Jul 18 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. I wish I could go back and listen to this album for the first time again. I've NEVER found the same feeling with an album as much as this one.  Sure, I love other bands and their releases (Breakdown of Sanity's Mirrors FTW), but NOTHING can compare to how I felt when I listened to Augment for the first time.   I can't thank the community of this sub enough for helping me discover new music."
Metalcore,3dpl5k,Zeppetella,8,Sat Jul 18 18:42:27 2015 UTC,I wish they would play Spirits Away live
Metalcore,3dpl5k,theBOSpaladin,3,Sat Jul 18 12:52:36 2015 UTC,Same. My favorite on the album for sure.

Metalcore,3dpl5k,Dwesk,8,Sat Jul 18 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"Fuck this was a great album, just like Impulse but the added clean vocals and certain melodies made it even more likeable to me. Didn't really like Moments of Clarity as much so I hope they release a new album which doesn't feel as filler. These guys have insane talent and potential and even Jesse's band Ghost Atlas is amazing."

One of those most well-rounded, fresh bands which have graced the scene in recent memory. I listened to this album constantly when I first discovered it. I'm hoping that their next full length can match up to the excellence excellence that is this record."
Metalcore,3dpl5k,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Sat Jul 18 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. When I heard that they were the OPENING band for the Frozen Flame Tour, I was completely caught off guard.  I bought tickets to the show in SLC ASAP and they were unable to make it due to their bus breaking down in the desert. To this day, I have been unable to see them live... but I'm holding out for the opportunity."

Metalcore,3drapu,NimbleFanimble,4,Sat Jul 18 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"I don't have spotify but I can assure you that there is a noticeable difference between the original and the reissue.   edit: if you're not, try using headphones because I think the difference is more pronounced that way."
Metalcore,3drapu,Tjdamage,5,Sat Jul 18 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"There is definitely a significant difference between the two versions. A lot of people have been saying that the Spotify version is the old version.   A good way to check if the version is new or not is to listen to the intros to Possibilities, Not Enough or Divinity - to me the difference is night and day, there are guitar leads present that I honestly had never heard before, it sounds amazing."
Metalcore,3drapu,FeelsToWaltz,2,Sat Jul 18 19:37:40 2015 UTC,I notice a very small difference but it's not enough to really change my opinion on the album.
Metalcore,3drapu,Runeon12,2,Sat Jul 18 19:15:20 2015 UTC,The new mix definitely has louder guitars and a fuller overall sound. I listened to them side by side and it was a pretty pronounced difference.
Metalcore,3drapu,Shepherd7X,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:50:34 2015 UTC,Massive difference especially if you listen to one after the other.

Metalcore,3drapu,ShyfterEU,2,Sat Jul 18 23:01:56 2015 UTC,I only listened to the first minute of No Ordinary Love (both the original and remastered versions) and I really noticed a difference with the drums. I wasn't looking for anything in particular but the drums really stuck out to me.
Metalcore,3drapu,boganhobo,2,Sat Jul 18 23:33:12 2015 UTC,"I have noticed the same thing. Need to get some time to acquire 'official' versions elsewhere and compare. When I downloaded the Deluxe Edition, I still had the old version synced. Thought that was my problem but even after I removed the old CD and redownloaded the Deluxe (and verified it was actually downloading new songs instead of using the local files by setting the quality to extreme), it still sounded the same as the old CD. The 2 new songs I can tell have a different mix."

Believe me, I know that the whole album definitely isn't all positive but those are some lyrics that I've snagged to prove my point.

Metalcore,3dmy4v,SnapCrack1ePop,3,Fri Jul 17 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"Just played with them in Queens.  Great band, good friends of ours.  Definitely a band you want to pay attention to"
Metalcore,3dmy4v,ajformale,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:28 2015 UTC,Obviously love this band. Saw them live about a year ago with Patrizio on vocals and they fucking slayed it. New vocalist sounds cool as fuck though.
Metalcore,3dmy4v,moshlyfe,2,Fri Jul 17 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"On top of being fantastic mucisians and the good news of a new vocalist, they're all really great guys. They're some of the nicest people I know in the CT scene. They're gonna blow up big time, keep an eye on them!"

Euphoria is my fave track too. :D I really like the new guy too although the previous one was irreplaceable, I seriously hope they pull off the more down-tempo chuggy sound they teased in the new teaser, becauce they're obviously amazing musicians but I hope they don't stray away too much from the current sound they had in L//L, cause it was so fucking refreshing."

Metalcore,3dlahn,nohitter21,10,Fri Jul 17 20:34:07 2015 UTC,I highly doubt this. I've met him and he seems very sincere if I'm honest. The way he interacts with his fans is extremely honest and sincere.

Most people who fake religion just make a few references here and there. But Matty seems to really have put time and faith in.   Still don't like the guy but I think he is sincere about his beliefs.

Probably one of the worst songs I've heard from them. It's not so much that these songs are ""bad"", but lack the energy and creativity of past releases. I've come to expect a level of talent when bands release new stuff, and lately some bands aren't evolving like some would like to say in defense, it's just plain laziness. I get it, people want to make money out of being a musician, it's just a shame that they have to make such garbage music in order to do so :("

Metalcore,3dj6fo,mayonnaise_man,23,Fri Jul 17 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"Well they're definitely past their 'prime'. Maybe not technically losing fans, but they're not the hot topic they were back when Roots came out."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,NimbleFanimble,2,Fri Jul 17 01:54:58 2015 UTC,Idk Dead Throne sold like 30k albums in the first week and 8:18 sold like half that.

Metalcore,3dj6fo,Jugeezy,23,Thu Jul 16 19:13:56 2015 UTC,Jordan of BMTH did just mention on Twitter that Happy Song isn't even supposed to be a single. So there is still a degree of hope for BMTH.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,RimShimp,16,Thu Jul 16 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"What is it then? Drown wasn't, the rap song wasn't, Happy Song isn't, what's it for?"
Metalcore,3dj6fo,nohitter21,14,Thu Jul 16 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"Seriously. It almost feels like they release new songs as ""singles"", many fans react poorly, and all of a sudden those songs have nothing to do with the new album. This is more reflective of Drown and Happy Song though."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Zackeezy116,19,Thu Jul 16 21:16:20 2015 UTC,Drown was never ever intended as a single though.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,nohitter21,12,Thu Jul 16 21:36:58 2015 UTC,Am I not allowed to like Drown? Cuz I really like Drown but people keep talking shit about it.    I guess I'll sit over here with my Memphis May Fire and Punk Goes Pop and take my bad Metalcore fan lashings like a man.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Zackeezy116,4,Fri Jul 17 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"I love Drown and pre-Unconditional MMF, no worries."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Ghitre27,3,Fri Jul 17 03:24:30 2015 UTC,but I really liked unconditional
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Zackeezy116,3,Fri Jul 17 03:29:32 2015 UTC,Shhh /r/metalcore won't hear that around here.   Super excited about the re-release though with all the remixing done.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Runeon12,2,Fri Jul 17 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"Stay the Course is such a good song, dude."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Zackeezy116,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:44:31 2015 UTC,"There shouldn't be anything wrong with that, man. If you liked it then own the fact that you liked it."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,RimShimp,2,Fri Jul 17 23:47:33 2015 UTC,I do.  It's just not a popular opinion.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,nohitter21,2,Sat Jul 18 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"No, but what I'm saying is when both songs came out, the band never specified whether or not they were single for the new album until after fan backlash. And for the record I think Drown is a great song!"
Metalcore,3dj6fo,RimShimp,2,Fri Jul 17 05:19:48 2015 UTC,I don't think that happened with Drown though
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Foxxxhound117,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:44:31 2015 UTC,"Drown just kind of came out of nowhere. I know there were a bunch of people on here who thought it was going to be on their next album, but it ended up not being so. Honestly, it's surprising to me that BMTH said if Drown is on the new album they made a mistake, but it seems many people prefer it to Happy Song."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,lolmasn69,5,Fri Jul 17 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"semi-off topic:  I remember when they released Drown Oli stated in an interview that if the new album had a similar sound to Drown they've fucked up, then i though 'then why the fk u wrote it lol'"
Metalcore,3dj6fo,marswithrings,8,Fri Jul 17 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"To do something different, they have the tools to just randomly write and record songs without doing a full album I bet.  If the BMTH album sounded like Drown or Happy Song, I wouldn't be too upset. It just wouldn't be a real BMTH album in my opinion.   If these are just random projects, then I'm actually really stoked for them."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,figmaxwell,5,Fri Jul 17 03:21:02 2015 UTC,"this is all a little weird for me because these comments make me feel like it's drown/happy song vs. rest of BMTH's catalog.  personally, i love drown, but i'm painfully unimpressed with happy song. it didn't seem to have the same power or just general effort in songwriting as drown did to me"
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Ne0nBlur,6,Fri Jul 17 05:50:19 2015 UTC,What does that even mean? If it's a song on their new record than it is at least somewhat reflective of the record. Just because it was or wasn't meant to come out earlier doesn't mean you shouldn't hold it to the standards of a song that you had to wait for until album release.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,figmaxwell,9,Thu Jul 16 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"Generally, singles from an album are a better indication of the overall sound of the album, than other tracks on it. Sempiternal had Seen It All Before + And The Snakes Start To Sing on it, but neither were singles and neither sounded paticularly close to the rest of the album. That is not to say that Happy Song isn't the direction that the new album is going in, but that it could just be a quiet track on an otherwise heavy album. We'l have to wait and see."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Rectifyer,4,Thu Jul 16 21:50:10 2015 UTC,Does anyone actually judge how good an album is off of one single? I usually end up liking the non-single tracks better on most albums
Metalcore,3dj6fo,philasophicalrocker,2,Thu Jul 16 23:21:05 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the case for me as well which is why I am withholding judgment until I hear the rest of the CD.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Mark0310,3,Thu Jul 16 23:28:29 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who liked Seen It all before?
Metalcore,3dj6fo,nohitter21,3,Fri Jul 17 05:12:01 2015 UTC,"No, I loved that song."

Metalcore,3dj6fo,Level69Troll,14,Thu Jul 16 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"Can never be sure if a band is selling out or they just want to write those types of songs. Sure some sell out, but some want to try something new. Always been a fan of TDWP and the new BMTH is interesting but I'll always be a fan of the old stuff. What sucks is when bands abandon the old stuff, and alienate that fan base."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,awkward__pickle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could just be a move of ""we want to try something new"", however it's shady when a band signs to a new label and changes how they sound because then it feels like the label did so to sell more. I was worried for August Burns Red but they actually did the opposite and sound more like their older, and in my opinion better stuff. Oh well, we will just have to wait and see on this, as I doubt we will ever get am official statement."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,klyrish,32,Fri Jul 17 10:23:25 2015 UTC,And this is why I respect them. Sort of flabbergasting that they're so popular in this day and age.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,TheWallaby,-28,Fri Jul 17 17:29:50 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? After Zombie, everything has been an experiment to get heavier and darker with none of what made their previous releases awesome. TDWP is completely phoned in now and Mike's voice is atrocious."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,klyrish,14,Thu Jul 16 18:39:17 2015 UTC,That's your opinion. You can't tell me they've sold out or aren't making an effort at good music; regardless of your opinion.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,MissMayIhelpyou,-10,Thu Jul 16 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"Sold out? No. Making an effort at good music? Also no. There's no creativity anymore in what they put out--it's so frustratingly formulaic. ""South of the City"" was surprisingly awesome (but it took about 15 listens before I could love it), but still incredibly repetitive. Same with ""Supernova."" My hopes for Space EP are VERY low now. :-/"
Metalcore,3dj6fo,klyrish,6,Thu Jul 16 22:29:12 2015 UTC,Well everything sounds repetitive when you listen to it more than 15 times. (Im problably going to get some hate on this ....but)  I don't like PWD because each song sounds insanely similar to one another. And TDWP seem to make each song unique in its one way.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,spideralex90,8,Thu Jul 16 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"The play count has nothing to do with how repetitive the song is. http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/devilwearsprada/southofthecity.html  The lyrics are 80% repeated, and yes: I understand how songs work and that choruses are generally repeated. This isn't just the chorus, though. Listen to ""Sassafras"" then and tell me that ""South of the City"" is as creative and original. It's not. It's following a formula that they've been using since Dead Throne. I LOVE The Devil Wears Prada (and I can see where you're coming from with PWD for sure), but it feels like another band pretending to be them at this point.   Seriously, listen to WRAABB again, then put on 8:18. Something's missing on 8:18; they've lost their spark. And I'm not just talking about the idiotic song titles. They traded in fun, creative songs for being as brutally heavy as possible and that's great, but it's getting old now. I miss the band they used to be and I'm not going to pretend that they're as good or better now than they were up through Zombie EP.  And Mike's voice (scream at least) is shot. Sorry, but it is. I saw them in Denver for the fourth time on the Zombie 5 tour a few months back and I felt bad for him because it seems like it's a real struggle to scream now. Half of the songs were just lazily sung or the mic was put to the crowd instead of screamed by him.  Bands change. It's okay to not like them as much and to recognize the fact they've declined--it doesn't take away from anything they've done, but it's clear that each release is not going to top the previous one anymore. It's not an attack against the fans or people who still love them, it's just the truth. I'm glad they're not doing radio rock or ""selling out"" but pretending they're the same band from 2011 and earlier is just deluding yourself."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,klyrish,3,Thu Jul 16 22:52:08 2015 UTC,"His voice is definitely shot. You can tell from live videos easily, but even listening to albums the quality of his voice gets worse with each album. I know he used to smoke cigarettes a lot (I'm assuming he still does) which doesn't help at all.  I love TDWP, but I'm right there with you, everything after Zombie has just been meh compared to their older stuff."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,MissMayIhelpyou,5,Thu Jul 16 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  People are acting like I'm saying they suck and are the worst band ever. I'm not. I'm just being honest and realistic about who they are in July 2015. They've lost something and I think it's pretty obvious, but I must be one of the very few  unplugged from the Matrix. You can pretend they're better than ever with each subsequent release, but it's just not true. And it's a damned shame."
Metalcore,3dj6fo,klyrish,3,Fri Jul 17 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"Most of the things you say are your opinion and I respect that ,but who says their trying to be the same band they were in 2011. They've stated after making WRAABB that they wanted a different dark and ""mature"" sound. I think its very difficult to top WRAABB because thats what put them on the metalcore ""map"". 8:18 is a fantastic album in my opinion ,it didnt have that ""spark you were talking about ,but still I really liked it (keep in mind its very difficult to stay at a consistent level after 10 year of making music)"
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Zackeezy116,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:24:35 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter. It's pretty clear that saying anything even remotely critical about TDWP is completely unacceptable here. Sorry they're not as good as they used to be.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,klyrish,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:30 2015 UTC,You don't like their new stuff as much as their old stuff.  I think the problem here is that you're stating your opinion like it's fact.
Metalcore,3dj6fo,Stillpro69,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:41:54 2015 UTC,I'm stating facts like they're facts and my opinion happens to agree with them.

Dont get me wrong, the band has definitely released some rough shit (City of Sin, 10 miles wide, Lost In Darkness), but they are certainly capable of gems (spanning multiple genres).

Enter making an acoustic thing to tide us over until they can flesh out their ideas.   3) They had studio time allotted to them to make a record but ISS didn't feel prepared enough to do so yet. So they did this acoustic EP and will re-enter the studio later this year and give them a little more time to write before they go do a full LP.   4) They fucking nailed it with their studio time, decided to do this EP as well and are doing this to blue-ball us.

Metalcore,3dldcj,oscar9909,2,Fri Jul 17 05:30:02 2015 UTC,"/thread but imho hardcore / PV / grind is more aggressive and hate filled (sounding, lyrics I dunno) than deathcore."
Metalcore,3dldcj,SMaddox50,3,Fri Jul 17 11:26:20 2015 UTC,Oh yeah differently but I think OP is more interested in the whole deathcore and metalcore genres more but I thought I would give it a chance and show him some kick ass bands
Metalcore,3dldcj,schfiftyschfifty5,3,Fri Jul 17 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"Powerviolence and crust punk are two genres that cover both of those things pretty well. There's a whole world of hate-inspired music out there, you just have to know what you're looking for!"

Metalcore,3dho15,teasizzle,5,Thu Jul 16 12:09:55 2015 UTC,"This song is okay, but it doesn't show off his skill and is pretty boring in comparison to what he wrote for the past two albums. The Genesis/Scarab playthrough is great, but the Corruption playthrough is fuckin nuts."
Metalcore,3dho15,DSice16,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why, but my favorite part of the Corruption video is the sock entering the screen at 3:31."
Metalcore,3dho15,TuhHahMiss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:30:32 2015 UTC,I can understand what you mean about it being boring in comparison but it's his ability to nail the bass drum line and do the rest cause it's a bit all over the place
Metalcore,3dho15,teasizzle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you, except he didn't write any of the stuff for Discoveries.  He came on board for Singularity.  But I wish he would vamp it up, it wasn't a thrill to watch like his other playthrough videos.  Good technique and very clean, but simple.   Edit: I was wrong, sorry"

Metalcore,3dfqzj,GeorgeTaylorG,13,Thu Jul 16 02:45:05 2015 UTC,Tyler and Michael are such a great duo. I'm glad they sticked together at least.

Metalcore,3dfqzj,KWCool13,7,Thu Jul 16 14:55:31 2015 UTC,"I think they would be better without Tyler. But they would also be kinda generic without him.. They're good at what they do, but it's just not for me"
Metalcore,3dfqzj,BrickFaceBenny,5,Thu Jul 16 08:53:35 2015 UTC,Id be interested to see what they'd sound like with a second guitarist. But they do well for only having 3 writing members. Though Tyler and Michael both play drums I believe so I'm sure they have a lot of input.
Metalcore,3dfqzj,thesewordsarefake,5,Thu Jul 16 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"Tyler makes Issues unique imo. He just adds so much flavor and passion to their songs, check out his stuff with Luke Holland, it's awesome."

Metalcore,3dgprf,DamnCheeto,16,Thu Jul 16 03:24:12 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, write songs and rehearse them. Once you've got about a five or six song setlist, start playing shows. Before you do that, though, GO to local shows. Make friends. Mingle. Develop connections. People know people who can help you get booked. Play local shows. That's the first step."

Metalcore,3dgprf,Citah,2,Thu Jul 16 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"This, but I would also add that you could throw in a cover song or two that are from bands that fit your bands style. A band I was in did that to keep the crowd with us, and play them something familiar, but after a while we got rid of our covers for our original stuff after our name got out there a little more and got a bigger fan base."
Metalcore,3dgprf,McDjonty,4,Thu Jul 16 07:23:25 2015 UTC,"Me and my friends did covers for starters. We did metal versions of songs too, like green days holiday etc!"
Metalcore,3dgprf,StoneyThrashez,3,Thu Jul 16 09:29:27 2015 UTC,Don't invest too much money if you won't take it serious. Also if you got some pretty good songs record them (maybe for free?) and then publish em. Also social media is a good option to get more fans.

Pandora/Grooveshark does a better job at this.
Metalcore,3dhajq,Dwesk,7,Thu Jul 16 09:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love Spotify but their radio function is pretty bad.

I did think it was a bit shitty that they didn't even mention him once throughout the entire thing, like they said Ahren wrote the entirety of Chasing Ghosts by himself, but I'm pretty sure Troy had an input in it. Guessing it must have been on worse terms than they first explained it to be."
Metalcore,3dghzp,MattBower,3,Thu Jul 16 09:06:27 2015 UTC,"Surely Joel would've been a big influence on the writing as well, considering a lot of the lyrics are based around suicide and his personal experiences with the topic..."

Metalcore,3deipn,-wwwpastacom,24,Wed Jul 15 17:25:46 2015 UTC,This thread notes that both Underoath's They're Only Chasing Safety and Avenged Sevenfold's Waking The Fallen have sold over 500k copies. Underoath's Define The Great Line has also achieved that feat. It's more than likely one of those albums if we're talking actual record sales.

Metalcore,3deipn,Informalmoose3,6,Thu Jul 16 06:09:29 2015 UTC,Common Courtesy sold 92k first week without a label didn't it? That seems more impressive to me.
Metalcore,3deipn,nohitter21,3,Thu Jul 16 00:09:13 2015 UTC,"The numbers for Common Courtesy are kinda odd, because it had two releases so to speak. The digital release, then the physical release a month or so later. I believe they said that if you combined both numbers it woulda been #1 on the Billboards (perhaps that 92k you refer to), however the nature of how it was sold means it never got as high as it should've (so maybe like 40k for the digital release and 50k for physical). This is all speculation though, I haven't found a place that gave the hard numbers."

People forget how massive that band got."
Metalcore,3deipn,andreasmiles23,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:58 2015 UTC,He said that in an interview about filling in for Adam Lazarra on Taking Back Sunday's summer 2012 tour. Adam's son had just been born and he wasn't going to be able to go. He asked Spence to cover for him.  At the time Spence was penniless. His rent was coming due and he was eating ramen for the two meals a day he could afford.   He seriously considered selling his golden records and what was left of his equipment. He considered suicide.   Then he got the call from Adam. And his life changed for the better.   He met the dude who he ended up starting Sleepwave with on that tour.

A7X, Killswitch, AILD, Atreyu, Bullet For My Valentine, Lamb of God (would they be called Metalcore?) or Trivium could all be contenders.  EDIT: Of the numbers I could find, A7X's Waking the Fallen, Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache, BFMV's Scream Aim Fire, and Trivium's Ascendacy have all crossed 500k sales."

All of these albums were sold in the last 2 years, and have done better than Attila. Not that Attila's album didn't sell well (obviously it has propelled them into being on of the top bands in the scene) just don't underestimate how well this scene does when selling albums, especially the top bands."

Metalcore,3dc2fp,jn062181,8,Wed Jul 15 16:08:36 2015 UTC,"Lol perfect.... Damn I miss old Trivium and this ""era"" of metal. I'll never forget walking out of Best Buy with my brother in law with Avenged Sevenfold's ""City of Evil"" and this album, which was just a ""I heard this was ok"" kinda purchase. After skipping thru after the first 30 seconds of every track of the A7X album we tossed it and popped in ""Ascendency."" Still one of my favorite albums to this day.😀"
Metalcore,3dc2fp,Bodom0511,6,Wed Jul 15 11:15:23 2015 UTC,I'm with you on that. Ascendancy and The Fall of Ideals are the two albums that got me into metalcore
Metalcore,3dc2fp,Pvt_MJCaboose,2,Wed Jul 15 13:13:40 2015 UTC,Along with The End of Heartache for me
Metalcore,3dc2fp,shini333,3,Wed Jul 15 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"Lol! That's basically the big chunk. Ascendency, fall of ideals, end of heartache, shadows are security. All those albums that dropped in a very short period of time."
Metalcore,3dc2fp,Bodom0511,3,Wed Jul 15 20:01:52 2015 UTC,I'm having to restrain from hurting you for saying that about CoE... Consider yourself saved by your love for Ascendancy :P
Metalcore,3dc2fp,Artemis360,0,Wed Jul 15 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"If you were a fan of ""Waking the Fallen"" A7X and was not thoroughly disappointed in the direction they decided to go with ""CoE"" idk what to say."
Metalcore,3dc2fp,Bodom0511,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"I was a fan of City of Evil before Waking the Fallen, so there really wasn't any disappointment. I'm a bigger fan of clean vocals than harsh vocals (though Waking the Fallen has become my favorite A7X album), so the turn they made in City of Evil was for the better IMO. However, though I still enjoy their new stuff, it will never reach the tier of amazingness that CoE and WTF were."
Metalcore,3dc2fp,Artemis360,0,Wed Jul 15 22:35:24 2015 UTC,"Granted, the instrumental work and skill on it is amazing. But the vocals and the teeny bopper theme they pushed hard, not to mention they begun wearing grills... Lol, I don't need a new era Guns n Roses. I hate the original enough."
Metalcore,3dc2fp,Bodom0511,2,Wed Jul 15 20:04:32 2015 UTC,"And that's where we differ, 'cause Guns N' Roses remains my all time favorite band, haha. I was a fan of City of Evil before Waking the Fallen (though I've become a bigger fan of the latter), so I've got a little bit of a bias."

Metalcore,3db2o8,Martin9714,21,Tue Jul 14 22:03:25 2015 UTC,"Love this band. They remind me of August Burns Red. Not because they sound like ABR, but because (like ABR) they have their own somewhat unique sound. They don't sound like another band to me, they sound like Silent Planet."

But, the more I listen to it the better it gets (that's applicable to the whole album though). It is a very successful expansion to what they have done in the past with ""Dyson Sphere"" and ""Wishing Well""."

FDTD just was not prime AA, and after Ben admitting he loathed writing those parts for the band/Danny's lack of sticking to their core sound, they will definitely get back to their roots.  You can just see so much more excitement in them now. At Warped, their set was energetic, and just spot on. Denis is a great fit. All of the guys were in a great mood and happy to see fans at their signing too, all very nice guys.   I told Ben I was stoked that they're going back to the new sound and free to do what they want.

Metalcore,3db4jt,Jorgetime,7,Tue Jul 14 22:17:15 2015 UTC,I bet Jona would have been able to keep BMTH on track
Metalcore,3db4jt,Slaughterhouse451,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:30:05 2015 UTC,"Or even if they got rid of him but replaced him with another guitarist. I can't help but think that the introduction of a synth/keyboard player in the band, instead of another guitarist, was one of the main factors in beginning to transition to a softer/more commercial sound."
Metalcore,3db4jt,Ne0nBlur,13,Wed Jul 15 00:35:15 2015 UTC,I disagree. If you've seen BMTH live recently you would agree that Jordan Fish was the perfect addition.
Metalcore,3db4jt,rectalsoup,5,Wed Jul 15 02:12:33 2015 UTC,Ditto. He really added the much needed melody that their previous songs/albums lacked.
Metalcore,3db4jt,jesuslaves,2,Wed Jul 15 04:33:51 2015 UTC,"I saw them at Wembley, which is currently their most recent gig to date, and whilst I can agree that he has shaped their sound, leading to Sempiternal, I wouldn't call him the perfect addition to the band."
Metalcore,3db4jt,Ne0nBlur,7,Wed Jul 15 11:41:09 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for Jordan, Sempiternal wouldn't have been anywhere close to as to good as it is. And he's not just the synth/keyboard player, he's also one of the main songwriters, and his songwriting skills trump whatever heaviness Jona or any other guitarist may have brought to the table. That said, this might be an exaggeration, but I honestly believe Jordan in a way ""saved"" the band, I don't think they would've lasted that much longer if it weren't for him."
Metalcore,3db4jt,jesuslaves,2,Wed Jul 15 04:17:07 2015 UTC,I felt the same way. Jordan was a breath of life for BMTH. And that's coming from someone who loved There is a Hell.
Metalcore,3db4jt,rectalsoup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:28:44 2015 UTC,"When it comes to progressing your sound as a band, you're damned if you do, damned if you don't, but I think even through whatever controversy it's stirred up, it's kept BMTH pretty fresh in peoples' minds, even if only to listen to whatever new material they put out to see if it's like what they're used to."
Metalcore,3db4jt,Eglitarian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:32:41 2015 UTC,Yet I didn't hear keyboards at all in Happy Song. Might just have been because it was a YouTube video.
Metalcore,3db4jt,englishmuffyn,2,Wed Jul 15 00:41:37 2015 UTC,The entire bridge/pre-breakdown is a keys/synth build-up. Not sure how you can miss that...
Metalcore,3db4jt,boganhobo,2,Wed Jul 15 11:11:58 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he also plays some percussion
Metalcore,3db4jt,Runeon12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"Again, probably because I was watching a YouTube video, and my headphones aren;t the best haha. I'll listen to it with better headphones when I can."
Metalcore,3db4jt,englishmuffyn,2,Wed Jul 15 11:31:27 2015 UTC,I mean youtube has nothing to do with it. There was literally no other instrument playing except for the synths during the bridge section. I'm not intenting to be a dick but it's like saying you can't hear the guitar during a guitar solo because it's on youtube.
Metalcore,3db4jt,boganhobo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:22:53 2015 UTC,"The one thing that Youtube does tend to do with sound, is really reduce the bass levels, to the extent that heavy bass drops in Deathcore, are often barely audible even with good quality headphones.   I used my Grado SR80i Headphones to listen to the youtube version of Hate by Thy Art is Murder, and then my 320kbps rip of the cd and the original cd, and the Youtube version had a distinctive lack of bass, even when run at 720p."
Metalcore,3db4jt,Ne0nBlur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that, but when the only thing playing is the synth you can't not hear it. I listened to the youtube version too and it sounds fine."
Metalcore,3db4jt,boganhobo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:42:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I guess it depends if the commenter knows what modern synths can sound like or not."
Metalcore,3db4jt,Ne0nBlur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:05 2015 UTC,That's fair enough. I suppose it could come across as a guitar with heavy distortion.
Metalcore,3db4jt,boganhobo,0,Wed Jul 15 14:39:24 2015 UTC,Jordan was also the writer of all the synths on There Is A Hell. He just wasn't made an official member until they started recording Sempiternal- if I remember correctly. He has been involved with the band much longer than his tenure as an official member.
Metalcore,3db4jt,tjauth,5,Wed Jul 15 14:19:31 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Oli was the writer of the synths on There Is a Hell, with some help from other DJs/Producers (I recall him mentioning Skrillex- who had previously colabarated on elements of Suicide Season- as a big help). Jordan was only involved after that, as prior to that, he was in his own band."

Metalcore,3d95kl,Hawnzor,2,Tue Jul 14 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, based solely off the three songs they have released. I haven't listened to the leak yet. I know lots of people are complaining about the lack of heaviness, but personally, heaviness doesn't define a great album for me. I don't expect a WCAR album to go hard the entire time, I expect some softer stuff, which is part of why I enjoy their albums.  That said, the three songs they have released are just so bland. Not a single one stands out to me as a jam that I am just going hit repeat on. The lyrics are cliche and the instrumentals are boring. Live, the songs are okay, but when I am in my car listening to music, these are the kind of songs I would probably just skip."

Metalcore,3d95kl,Quackimaduck1017,19,Tue Jul 14 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"Look I am huge fan of ABR. Like I'm that guy amongst my friends who is known for obsessing about ABR. FIFAP wasn't a bad album by any means. But this is where I noticed the problem. And it was those interludes.  I loved Internal Canon's interlude and it worked really well for that song. Then R&R had some songs with them and those worked too. But seriously 9 out of the 11 songs from FIFAP have them and IMO it's just too much. I feel like there would be such a heavy part and be interrupted by another interlude. ABR recognizes that people liked Internal Canon and R&R but they really over did it in this album.  Another thing thats bothered me since R&R is the leads. There seems to be so many leads over the breakdowns and it just pulls away from that heaviness. And not to mention I feel like the chords they use seem to be in more of a ""happy"" key, rather than being a super aggressive breakdown.  Another problem and I noticed, and it doesn't just apply to this album, is the mix. I feel like the mixes are getting progressively worse from album to album. Messengers=Phenomenal, Constellations=Good, Leveler=Alright, R&R=Meh, FIFAP=Meh. IMO they need to stop working with Grant. Messegenrs had such amazing guitar tone, drums cut through so well and vocals were very present. FIFAP is a mess IMO.  Look this isn't a bad album by any means because I genuinely enjoyed but pull off Jake from the vocals and change band name and I could easily believe it's another band."
Metalcore,3d95kl,xdrummerxdan,19,Tue Jul 14 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really care for August burns red one bit but since found in far away places came out I loved it. Personally for me it was the guitar leads. Those licks were wicked. I dunno why you didn't like the leads over the ""happy"" breakdowns so to speak but you can't really expect a band to just play super aggressive open drop b chugged breakdowns every song. That's boring as hell. I found that for the most part these breakdowns were very well placed and the guitar lead over top of it was different and for me well received.  The interludes I thought were fantastic. It was a nice break in the song and it kept me entertained throughout. I've found rescue and restore boring. Didn't even bother giving it more than one listen. Leveller was good and so was constellations. But for me found in far away places was probably for me their best work yet. Especially the lyrics. Ghosts is a fucking fantastic song lyrically. It's just captures homelessness so well"
Metalcore,3d95kl,jwatch04,2,Tue Jul 14 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I love the leads in this album. And although I agree with OP about the interludes being a bit much, overall, this might be my favorite album by ABR."
Metalcore,3d95kl,HelpIThinkImASoup,-2,Wed Jul 15 04:57:44 2015 UTC,"Doing ""anything"" every single song is boring as hell whether it's chugging break downs or soft interludes.   FIFAP is boring as hell"
Metalcore,3d95kl,DistanceSkater,8,Tue Jul 14 23:53:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I find that Messengers has the worst mix for me, listening to it with headphones is quite grating. I get what your saying about the inetrludes, I find the obvious ones like in Majoring the Minors a bit jarring, but the ones on the later tracks have more of a post-rock/ambient vibe, which is a lot less intrusive."
Metalcore,3d95kl,EliteCombine07,7,Tue Jul 14 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"I cant agree that I'm disappointed, yet i can fully agree there are too many breaks. i do like the majority of them, but like you said, 9/11 (Bush Did it) is too much. Separating the Seas and the way it drops after the interlude is done perfectly. Majoring in the minors is probably my least favorite interlude. It's cool but it doesn't really belong. Musically, I think this is their best album. It is the most technical. When i just saw them play Identity and The Wake at Warped they slayed. (That shouldnt be a set spoiler its their singles from FIFAP)"
Metalcore,3d95kl,uncivilized2k,3,Tue Jul 14 15:51:33 2015 UTC,If you take out the interludes I think it would be my favorite album from them. That's what makes it so disappointing to me.
Metalcore,3d95kl,Pvt_MJCaboose,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:14 2015 UTC,I totally agree that musically this is hands down their best album. I mean still really like the album! Just one too many interludes IMO.
Metalcore,3d95kl,xdrummerxdan,6,Tue Jul 14 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yup. They may be better musicians on this album but half of the interludes are forced. Identity, Majoring in the Minors, Broken Promises.   It's a funny duality. In one way, they have become more patient in parts of the album. There are a lot of musical themes in songs that last quite a long time. A very progressive trait  Yet at the same time, the interludes are rushed and forced. Like they had the song all written out and then they're like ""Dang we forgot to put the interlude in."" And then they just drop it in.   If they dropped the whole interlude thing while still getting more progressive, they would finally release a 5/5 album again."
Metalcore,3d95kl,ThumYorky,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:00 2015 UTC,Exactly. The interludes seem so forced. And I agree 100% that if they dropped just a few interludes this can be a serious 10/10 album.
Metalcore,3d95kl,xdrummerxdan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"The one in Separating the Seas is the only one that I truly think is forced. The one in majoring in the minors is pushing it though. In Martyr it feels like they wrote a giant breakdown and broke it up with a small part. However, the stuff in Everlasting Ending to the end of the album was phenomenal, it blended so well. Identity worked very well for me though, the surf theme kinda brought itself into the solo as well and I thought it was pretty neat. What was wrong with it?"
Metalcore,3d95kl,kellermrtn,3,Wed Jul 15 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"While ABR is still my favorite band, I agree with you completely. I'm starting to feel like FIFAP is my least favorite ABR album - not surprising at all, since Internal Cannon is actually one of my least favorite songs by them as well. This is just Internal Cannon in a few different flavors, which makes for a bland album. R&R had a way better blend of progressive and heavy, IMO."
Metalcore,3d95kl,Bottlerocket7,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:47 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. R&R is what ABR is all about. It is their defining album.
Metalcore,3d95kl,DistanceSkater,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:54:52 2015 UTC,"Besides Messangers, they don't have another defining album imo, everything is building on each other. FIFAP is at least a baby step in every direction (a huge one in the # of interludes haha), and I hope they keep refining the sounds from this album."
Metalcore,3d95kl,kellermrtn,4,Wed Jul 15 03:23:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much disagree with everything you said. Yeah they have a lot of interludes, but they work. Definitely improved since R&R. Also, leads are better than ever. Why not put them over breakdowns? Those are actually the best. Mixing? What on earth is wrong with the mix?"
Metalcore,3d95kl,awkward__pickle,2,Tue Jul 14 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree with this, plain metalcore is getting stale and has been done to death. ABR being one of the older metalcore bands still going knew they couldn't just repeat the formula, which is actually how I felt about their last album. The interludes work and give the songs something different. They show creativity, musicianship, and some risk taking. I'd rather them overdue something new then stick to the same thing too much and lose steam like many older metalcore bands who can't adapt end up doing."
Metalcore,3d95kl,strayfromthebath,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:30:58 2015 UTC,"Look I'm not saying that those interludes are terrible. Musically, this is the best album they've made and in the entire Metalcore scene. I too hate just these bands that jug all day. I've always loved the major riffing and the melody ABR brought to the scene. But they noticed people liked Internal Canon and R&R and now it seems like they're forcing those interludes down our throats."
Metalcore,3d95kl,xdrummerxdan,0,Wed Jul 15 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"We don't want bands to follow the standard metalcore structure, but when ABR comes up with a new structure (intro riff/breakdown interlude riff/breakdown outro, at least that's what it feels like), everyone seems to hate on it. I mean, almost every type of music in any genre tends to follow loose (or strict) guidelines. Heck, even prog metal has its own 'sound', and can even have similar song structures. Why can't ABR do that without getting hated on. Like honestly, isn't everyone tired of 5 albums of nearly the same thing yet?"
Metalcore,3d95kl,kellermrtn,2,Wed Jul 15 03:31:00 2015 UTC,"Jesus fucking Christ it's like no one read what I wrote. FIFAP IS NOT A BAD ALBUM. The interludes and the musicality of this album is phenomenal. But I, and many others, seem to find them a bit excessive. R&R had a very good balance of them and that was an album was far from your ordinary jugging bullshit."
Metalcore,3d95kl,xdrummerxdan,2,Wed Jul 15 04:44:47 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that a couple of the interludes are bad. The pirate interlude in Separating The Seas was atrocious and went on way  too long. But for most of the songs, I don't even notice the interlude intruding the songs. To me, that means they blend in very well.   I whole-heartedly disagree with you about the mixes. In an objective sense, Messengers' mix was bad. It definitely is the product of a low budget for a band trying to break into the scene. It is raw, which makes it heavier, but the china tone was deafening. Constellations had a great mix for everything but the vocals. The drums were recorded phenomenally. Leveler is prolly their worst mix. It's just sterile and boring. R&R and FIFAP have similar mixes, and I feel the mixes add aggressiveness in a cleaner way than Messengers.  Lastly, I thought FIFAP was very aggressive for ABR. Other than Identity, Majoring In The Minors, and Everlasting Ending, I was surprised by how aggressive the rest of the songs were."
Metalcore,3d95kl,GOML_OnMyLevel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:44:37 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that this is an aggressive album but as I stated I feel like without a few leads it could've sounded a lot more aggressive.
Metalcore,3d95kl,xdrummerxdan,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:53 2015 UTC,I'm a sucker for leads over a breakdown.   It's basically why I love The Ghost Inside lol
Metalcore,3d95kl,GOML_OnMyLevel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"I like the shorter interludes like 21 Grams everlasting ending and broken promises. The big ones just go on too long and end up taking away from the genre. Like, ABR could make a djent folk Asian interlude and I'd be fine with it if it wasn't much longer than 20-30 secs. Not quite sure I like the cymbals on this album yet, they sound a little tinglely or whatever in my car (idk?)  And it could've used a few faster tempos, the only songs that really felt fast were The Wake and 21 Grams"
Metalcore,3d95kl,kellermrtn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:36:04 2015 UTC,Honestly I loved R&R but FIFAP just kinda comes off boring and redundant from them almost like a best of album with no hits just tributes to those hits.
Metalcore,3d95kl,coolbad96,3,Wed Jul 15 07:33:51 2015 UTC,"I was pretty unimpressed with Elitist's new release, felt way less techy but maybe I just haven't gotten into the groove, I only listened once and I don't remember it much at all."
Metalcore,3d95kl,kage6613,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:59:24 2015 UTC,I've actually listened to it a few times now and was just listening to it earlier. This album just feels like they took a different approach and worked on writing songs with flow rather than random breakdowns everywhere. Listen a few more times and you may like it more.   it took a few play throughs for me to actually like what I was hearing
Metalcore,3d95kl,sempiturtle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:53 2015 UTC,Yeah it was just a good album. From a band with some great past releases they kind of just released a standard good metalcore album. Nothing special or memorable just a pretty good album. It's a fun listen but it's not going to get a lot of re-listens.
Metalcore,3d95kl,blondecloudyhaze,19,Tue Jul 14 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"I don't really have any disappointing albums yet so I'll just go ahead and say that what I've heard from the new Northlane is pretty disappointing. Not a fan of the decline in heaviness. I wouldn't mind the cleans if they didn't have to go into some kind of ambient space opera every time they employ them. Not saying it's ""bad"", just not what I expect from them."
Metalcore,3d95kl,TheWallaby,7,Tue Jul 14 14:35:35 2015 UTC,"I think that's what they're going for though, something that people haven't heard before. In interviews they've said they don't want to simply churn out an average metalcore album that's the same as the rest, they're finding their niche and I've got a lot of respect for that. Plus I think the new stuff is dope but I defo see where you're coming from, I miss Adrian a bit"
Metalcore,3d95kl,hungryjack128,11,Tue Jul 14 16:04:19 2015 UTC,"See, I don't understand that response at all. They had a niche. I can't pick out one band (besides Erra or Invent, Animate) that sounds like Northlane. The chugs were obviously great and fun, but there was such mysticism in some of the leads (like Worldeater and Quantum and Transcending). Also, my favorite thing about Adrian wasn't his lows (though they were brutal), it was his vocal rhythm. Even after I knew all the lyrics it took me awhile to learn his rhythm (the last third of dispossession, intro to corruption, intro to worldeater). It was just so crazy and cool.  They were the most cohesive band I'd ever heard. Their new stuff is really boring in my honest opinion, and I'm afraid they're separating the vocal from the music. Marcus' rhythm and vocals are way on top of the instruments, whereas Adrian felt like just another instrument. I hope that makes sense."
Metalcore,3d95kl,DSice16,5,Tue Jul 14 17:37:11 2015 UTC,I've been trying to figure out what made Northlane different for the longest time and I think you just nailed it on the head there. That was well put.

Metalcore,3d95kl,SetYourGoals,0,Tue Jul 14 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"And that they've decided to go all Midnight Oil on the environmental protection theme that the album is based on, seems kinda weak for a metal album. Northlane just seem to keep going downhill, and I say this as somebody happy to say Dispossession is my favourite metalcore song ever."
Metalcore,3d95kl,Classiest_Erection,7,Tue Jul 14 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not disappointed in Found in far away places, but I certainly didn't expect to be listening to Thy art Holy War on loop instead of ABR. Found in far just isn't heavy enough for me right now. Maybe in the winter I'll enjoy it. I always get really into ABR when it's cold outside"
Metalcore,3d95kl,DistanceSkater,6,Tue Jul 14 15:04:03 2015 UTC,Are we listening to the same record? Fifap is def their heaviest since Messengers.
Metalcore,3d95kl,awkward__pickle,6,Tue Jul 14 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"Some parts, yeah it's heavy.   But EVERY SINGLE SONG has a 30-45 second pause where they get all artsy. Which is totally cool....just not every single song, it really kills the flow. I think they really perfected their sound with R&R it had a great balance ofl heavy and artistic. FIFAP has a lot of anti breakdowns, reminds of me Leveler which is my least favorite album.   R&R > Constellations > Messengers > FIFAP > Thrill Seeker > Leveler   If the rest of FIFAP hit as hard as The Wake it might be my second favorite. I just can't get over how perfect R&R is. I still listen to that album every day.  I just went back and listened to the entire album, skipping through each song in 20 second intervals just to make sure I wasn't mistaken...No, every single song has a soft instrumental peice. Total unnecessary to do that 100% of the time."
Metalcore,3d95kl,DistanceSkater,3,Tue Jul 14 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Doing it every single song pretty much ruined it for me. There are plenty of ways to make songs flow and bridge parts together and I hate how they went about it. I can understand they were trying to be creative but it's not that creative when you do the same slow ambient part in every song.
Metalcore,3d95kl,blondecloudyhaze,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"100% agreed (apart from the favourite placement)  Identity is my favorite song atm, and imo the most heaviest one. If only the rest was like it"
Metalcore,3d95kl,top_KeK_420,-11,Tue Jul 14 21:05:20 2015 UTC,Just because it's not heavy enough for you doesn't make it a bad release.
Metalcore,3d95kl,iBlaire,6,Tue Jul 14 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"""Bad release"" is entirely subjective. If someone doesn't think an album is heavy enough, then that is a perfectly justifiable reason to think it was a bad album.   A lot of people on this thread have said WCARs new album is terrible, I happen to disagree. It's definitely not their best, but it is an improvement from the last album.   I really dislike when people say things like ""the band is just progressing, if you don't like the new music don't listen to it. Just because you think it's bad doesn't mean it's bad"". No. Just no. If I think something is bad, of course that means its bad. That doesn't mean you can't think it's good, however.   All of this is completely subjective, and everyone's opinions are going to vary."
Metalcore,3d95kl,Jake2197,-8,Tue Jul 14 17:01:23 2015 UTC,".... I'm sorry, uh...who are you speaking too? Because I certainly didn't say that.  Move along kiddo."

I'm preparing for the worst with Miss May I. Rise of the Lion was such a huge turnoff to me. I.H.E sounds pretty awesome, but never judge an album by it's lead single.   I'm also a little on edge about Northlane's album. Rot grew on me after a few listens, but I'm just worried it won't feel the same. Time will tell."
Metalcore,3d95kl,Ridley290,0,Tue Jul 14 14:49:55 2015 UTC,I've listened to each of the new Northlane songs and I just am not a fan of the way it sounds . I came into Northlane right after Adrian left and I love discoveries and singularity especially. But the new album just isn't what I would have liked from them.
Metalcore,3d95kl,Valetorix,8,Tue Jul 14 19:44:08 2015 UTC,Not really metalcore but I was pretty disappointed with Stick To Your Guns new album.
Metalcore,3d95kl,I_Nut_In_Butts,9,Tue Jul 14 15:01:19 2015 UTC,"It wasn't bad, just kinda meh. Nothing compared to diamond"
Metalcore,3d95kl,festivewalrus,3,Tue Jul 14 18:53:37 2015 UTC,Exactly how I felt. I loved Nobody as a single which had me super hyped but every song just fell flat for me I guess.

Metalcore,3d95kl,sempiturtle,2,Tue Jul 14 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"I understand that completely. There were a couple songs in there I really did like but since I've been listening to STYG since before The Hope Division I had an expectation of just more heaviness I guess. This album lacked in the breakdown department which their previous albums absolutely did not lack in. I get why people would enjoy it more than I did, there is no denying their talent in song writing, just not the STYG sound I liked. I'm willing to bet I would have liked it 1000% more if it wasn't STYG"

Metalcore,3d95kl,I_Nut_In_Butts,3,Tue Jul 14 22:45:31 2015 UTC,For me Parkway Drives Bon Jovi like song was the biggest disappointment and then the new BMTH song. I have a feeling 2015-2017 will be the era metalcoreish radio rock takes over
Metalcore,3d95kl,strayfromthebath,9,Tue Jul 14 23:32:28 2015 UTC,"In Hearts Wake's Skydancer, the album is pretty okay, but feels generic. They lost that special ambiance they had on Earthwalker."
Metalcore,3d95kl,shadowxxs6,7,Tue Jul 14 17:39:14 2015 UTC,Really? That's interesting to me because I thought Earthwalkers was their weakest release and thought Skydancer was back in form with Divination or at least close.
Metalcore,3d95kl,I_Nut_In_Butts,5,Tue Jul 14 19:02:13 2015 UTC,Different strokes for different folks
Metalcore,3d95kl,MissMayIhelpyou,3,Tue Jul 14 19:07:40 2015 UTC,Absolutely! Just one of the first times I've heard someone preferred Earthwalkers over Skydancer

Had my expectations up high for skydancer mainky because of all the cool collabs, but it just didnt get me. The songs were a bit better live, but still didn't get me over the edge. I might be seeing them in the fall so im going to give it another try"
Metalcore,3d95kl,shadowxxs6,2,Tue Jul 14 22:28:26 2015 UTC,I guess I just cared more for their heavier side and less ambient side
Metalcore,3d95kl,I_Nut_In_Butts,3,Tue Jul 14 22:34:08 2015 UTC,I only like a few songs on the new album.  I only liked the first album though so I knew what i was getting into.
Metalcore,3d95kl,adtr007,3,Tue Jul 14 19:00:48 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I was pretty excited for this album hearing that it was going to be heavier but wow did they turn down the instrumentals. That whole album was just chugging with a few interesting riffs spread throughout. I definitely thought divination was more interesting instrumentally.
Metalcore,3d95kl,blondecloudyhaze,2,Tue Jul 14 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"Badlands, Cottonmouth and Intrepid are awesome songs. Unfortunately the rest of the album is pretty boring. Erase is terrible."

Metalcore,3d95kl,alexxxpoling,7,Tue Jul 14 22:22:36 2015 UTC,Not metalcore but that new Muse album is terrible
Metalcore,3d95kl,dynamo_77,2,Tue Jul 14 15:29:27 2015 UTC,Really? What didn't you like about it? I personally loved it. It's a proper rock album. Their musicianship shone on this album. The tapping lick in reapers is phenomenal and the guitar riff in psycho is amazing. Sure the concept isn't the greatest but it's for sure muse. It almost reminded me of a blend of origin of symmetry with a hint of the resistance and the second law sprinkled in there.
Metalcore,3d95kl,jwatch04,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"I will say I liked it much more than I liked The Resistance or Second Law (bleh). I still didn't love it.

Metalcore,3d95kl,ShyfterEU,2,Tue Jul 14 15:43:58 2015 UTC,What's the difference between the interludes on R&R and fifap? They seem better executed if anything on the new album.
Metalcore,3d95kl,awkward__pickle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:13 2015 UTC,I think most people seem to be overwhelmed by the fact that there's an 'interlude' on almost every track.
Metalcore,3d95kl,englishmuffyn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:13:12 2015 UTC,Exactly this. I didn't mind them on R&R at all because they didn't destroy the sound structure for me. On FIFAP they feel forced and unnecessary.
Metalcore,3d95kl,ShyfterEU,4,Wed Jul 15 10:40:41 2015 UTC,I personally hated new August Burns Red. Apparently the new WCAR is terrible but I didn't really expect anything from them so I don't consider that disappointing. I think BMTH is going for the crown though.

That album is incredible from start to finish (even the added deluxe edition tracks are awesome).   I can see how some people wouldn't like it (especially if they hate gang vocals, that album is rife with them), but to say that it's disappointing is very disingenuous. I'm a huge fan of the band, and considering Loz's vocal surgeries and the time they had to take off, I was expecting a nightmare of an album but was blown away."

They just threw too many into FIFAP and they feel forced at times, like they put them in just to satisfy the ""progressive"" half of their progressive-metal sound."

Vice Grip wasn't great but they said there's only one other song on the album that sounds like that and the rest is darker and heavier. I don't think they have another Horizons or Killing With a Smile up their sleeve but I'm cautiously optimistic about this album.
Metalcore,3d95kl,Pvt_MJCaboose,3,Tue Jul 14 16:53:05 2015 UTC,Based on vice grip? They did an interview and said vice grip and the last song are the onle soft notes while the rest are some of the darkest songs they've made.

Metalcore,3dazu2,idontlikeu6,2,Tue Jul 14 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"Texas In July -  BloodWork.   To me, it's the most complete, best sounding, amazing metalcore album of all time. I know this opinion is going to be in the minority both in terms of songs and artists, but that's the beauty of music.   My total Spotify count of full play through is at 277, multiple songs (Pseudo Self and Inner Demons.. Etc) at 400+ listens. It's just my favorite album. Before this album I always though TIJ was meh, but I distinctly remember on my way to campus last semester, right as I pulled into the parking lot Broken Soul started, I sat in my car for those next 4 minutes and was just in awe. JT might be one of the best vocalists and I really hope he starts a band after TIJ separates this year.   Anyone who has never given TIJ a chance or disliked old TIJ, believe me, I was with you, but please give this album a listen. Pick any song and I think you'll see why I love it so much. Fans of metalcore, please do yourself of favor and listen to this album. It's heavy, it's fast, it's aggressive, it's in your face, but most of all its a beautiful piece of work."

Metalcore,3da0z7,TheCancerWizard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:28 2015 UTC,Absolutely Not.  The audio sounds exactly the same in 1080p than in 240p.  It makes absolutely no sense for the quality of audio to change when you change the amount of pixels that are being displayed.
Metalcore,3da0z7,paseoSandwich,2,Wed Jul 15 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"Pixel count isn't related to audio quality, but youtube does compress audio at different levels for different resolutions. This would make more sense if Youtube listed videos as ""low"", ""medium"" and ""high"" instead. Here's the breakdown:  Lower ""resolution"" videos use the MPEG audio layer in mono at 22050hz, 8kb/s  Higher quality videos are in stereo using AAC audio (mp4a) at 44100hz and a variable bitrate."

Epitaph is meant to be like the biggest of the indie labels, while Columbia is major major there is Beyoncé on the label.

Metalcore,3d6suv,Raxyn13,16,Tue Jul 14 04:18:07 2015 UTC,I guess that explains the more mainstream style of their new single.
Metalcore,3d6suv,BagofSocks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:20:26 2015 UTC,It just sounds like Three Days Grace to me.

Metalcore,3d6suv,dethandtaxes,-1,Tue Jul 14 10:10:08 2015 UTC,"Downbeat tempo (4/4 timing), long drawn out anthem-like singing followed by alternating melodic bridges and bass-guitar prominence for ""heaviness"".  The only difference: Production value is better and doesn't sound so dry/empty/underwhelming and Oliver screams a little bit here and there."
Metalcore,3d6suv,everestCS,6,Tue Jul 14 17:24:39 2015 UTC,Wait I thought they had just signed with rca right before releasing sempiternal? I'm confused...
Metalcore,3d6suv,Epochcoda16,6,Tue Jul 14 21:28:55 2015 UTC,They're signed to Columbia for US release and RCA for the rest of the world. Both labels are owned by Sony though

Metalcore,3d6suv,rootfiend,10,Tue Jul 14 16:23:42 2015 UTC,Welp. We can officially stop calling them Metalcore.
Metalcore,3d6suv,Micokerts,2,Tue Jul 14 12:23:01 2015 UTC,"They were signed with Sony when Sempiternal was recorded. It won't alter their music whatsoever. They are just going to write what the want, like they always have, regardless of what label they are on. Whether or not what they've written for this album is metalcore or not is a different matter."
Metalcore,3d6suv,Naturalz,2,Tue Jul 14 05:02:43 2015 UTC,Bullshit. You don't sign with Columbia unless you're selling out.
Metalcore,3d6suv,Micokerts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:48:56 2015 UTC,"Or because it's a great opportunity for exposure and bigger budgets for better production. BMTH has always done whatever the hell they want to do. SS was way more creative and listenable than CYB, and once Curtis was gone, they only got better. They're maturing and doing what they feel. We'd still have gotten happy song even if they'd stayed with Epitaph"

Metalcore,3d6suv,Nomnom_downvotes,3,Tue Jul 14 12:49:30 2015 UTC,I guess I'm the only one not disappointed at all.  I've loved everything this band has done. Sempiternal was their best album yet and I'm sure they're only gonna get better. Looking forward to it.
Metalcore,3d6suv,Volumes18,4,Tue Jul 14 13:18:27 2015 UTC,"Shame to see what my favorite band has turned into. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for bands evolving and changing. But this? This is a step in the wrong direction. This isn't evolution. This is a complete restart. I don't even feel right calling ""Drown"" or ""Happy Song"" BMTH songs."
Metalcore,3d6suv,tumtadiddlydoo,16,Tue Jul 14 18:42:17 2015 UTC,Drown feels like a very natural evolution from Sempiternal to me. Happy Song sounds like a pretty big off shoot and different thing to me. I still really enjoy both.
Metalcore,3d6suv,NimbleFanimble,8,Tue Jul 14 04:10:18 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan of everything BMTH has done prior to Drown and an especially big fan of the Sempiternal album, I hear absolutely nothing of Sempiternal in Drown. Sempiternal was a hard-hitting metal album with heavy electronic influence from the incorporation of synth to the actual song structure. Drown on the other hand sounds much more like an emo rock album. Drown is their biggest change since Count Your Blessings>Suicide Season.  I feel Suicide Season to Sempiternal is an evolution of the same sound where Drown and Happy Song seem to toss everything the band has done right out the window."
Metalcore,3d6suv,tumtadiddlydoo,4,Tue Jul 14 04:43:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with Suicide Season evolving into Sempiternal. Idk, I see where Drown came from. It feels natural to me. Happy Song feels super different, but after listening to a bunch of times now, I really dig it."
Metalcore,3d6suv,NimbleFanimble,7,Tue Jul 14 05:24:39 2015 UTC,"I could let Drown slip because every band does a soft song. But if that's the direction they're going, instead of raging over the change, I'm just going to disregard it. More time to spend listening to the other new albums of 2015 worth my time, like Northlane, In Hearts Wake, and Ai640."
Metalcore,3d6suv,tumtadiddlydoo,3,Tue Jul 14 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what you want. I understand why someone wouldn't like drown or happy song. I don't really care if a band goes soft as long as they still sound good. Like OM&M. I think they went soft and SUCKED, so completely boring. However, BMTH's soft songs so far I really enjoy. But I get why people would be disappointed."
Metalcore,3d6suv,NimbleFanimble,5,Tue Jul 14 05:55:26 2015 UTC,I'm a longtime fan of OM&M but I think the new stuff sucks because it's almost as if they didn't make the album from an artistic expression standpoint- they made it specifically to fit the wants of their audience. It's just not personal.
Metalcore,3d6suv,Stefunnyruiz,3,Tue Jul 14 05:59:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty perfectly said. I listen to Restoring Force and it feels like its soul purpose was to be commercial. The lyrics are all super typical and lame, and very broad. Lyrics on the first 2 seemed very personal in some songs, while for Restoring Force every song (besides PSA) sounded like it was written to be the most generic and reach the widest audience. And I don't hate them for that, they want to be big, and it's clearly working. But nothing on Restoring Force has heart, it all feels very ""safe""."
Metalcore,3d6suv,NimbleFanimble,2,Tue Jul 14 06:19:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've seen them nine times yet that streak ended in 2013 because I just can't stomach Restoring Force. I've loved them since No Really, It's Fine - and saw them before they even had members, it was just ""Though She Wrote"" and Austin, and it was amazing. It's so hard to see what they are doing now, I hate it."

Metalcore,3d6suv,BigshotBunny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:01:46 2015 UTC,I love there is a hell but it doesn't even come close to Sempiternal IMO.
Metalcore,3d6suv,NimbleFanimble,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"""Drown"" has that dark, gritty atmosphere that really shines in Sempiternal. It's not heavy, but honestly, how much further off the rails is it from ""Can You Feel My Heart"" or ""Hospital for Souls."" I think those songs lyrically are darker and fit the concept of the album better, but ""Drown"" really isn't that far off sound-wise from those two."
Metalcore,3d6suv,andreasmiles23,8,Tue Jul 14 19:50:33 2015 UTC,Why would you not be happy about them signing to a bigger label and getting more recognition? Can we at least wait until the album before we crucify them?
Metalcore,3d6suv,nohitter21,0,Tue Jul 14 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"I've heard two songs. Neither are to my liking. It is safe to assume that I will not like the album, as singles are meant to represent the album and I literally cannot think of the last time I've liked an album and not the singles. They may not be the best tracks off the album but the singles are always good to me."
Metalcore,3d6suv,tumtadiddlydoo,9,Tue Jul 14 06:51:44 2015 UTC,"Drown is not even on the album, so you've heard one song from the album."
Metalcore,3d6suv,nohitter21,-10,Tue Jul 14 07:07:58 2015 UTC,"Show me where they've said Drown is a lone single.  Regardless, it's still reasonable to assume that, after the softer ""Happy Song"", that it AND Drown are indications of their direction."

""It's not going on there... not unless we get really desperate!"" jokes Sykes. Keyboardist Jordan Fish adds: ""We're planning to record early next year. We want it out by the end of next summer, but we don't know what it's gonna sound like yet. If 'Drown' goes on the album, it means it hasn't gone well!""  Sykes explains: ""We want a tone and theme to the album, and that wouldn't be 'Drown'. Having 11 songs like 'Drown' would be a bit too much. It will be a bit more edgy and a bit more disoriented. We want to be the catchiest band we can get, but in a non-conventional way."""
Metalcore,3d6suv,nohitter21,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:29:01 2015 UTC,Touche on that. Touche  Edit: Still not pleased with the direction they're going. I've not once felt so much disinterest in any of their songs
Metalcore,3d6suv,tumtadiddlydoo,4,Tue Jul 14 07:51:05 2015 UTC,"So again, the album will still be heavy and you can judge it once it's released or leaked like Sempiternal was."
Metalcore,3d6suv,nohitter21,-3,Tue Jul 14 07:58:08 2015 UTC,"""The album will still be heavy"" now that's definitely an assumption."
Metalcore,3d6suv,tumtadiddlydoo,3,Tue Jul 14 08:00:55 2015 UTC,It will be a bit more edgy and a bit more disoriented   That's exactly what that means.
Metalcore,3d6suv,nohitter21,2,Tue Jul 14 08:09:07 2015 UTC,Why would you not be happy about a band possibly selling out and making a song possibly a whole album catered to a different music crowd? Lol people are ridiculous this is metalcore not rock we aren't gonna like the song.
Metalcore,3d6suv,MyDamnation,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:16:24 2015 UTC,"Almost every time a favourite band of mine has signed to a major label, and I have waited for the album, it's let me down. It doesn't matter how much a band says it won't change them, it always does because they are no longer in control of what gets released. It's natural to be pessimistic about it because it very rarely turns out to be good.  The only band I can think that escaped this was Gallows, they signed with Warner Bros, released what is their best album, managed to leave the contract without having to pay money back and then went on to record utter drivel when Frank left."
Metalcore,3d6suv,samsaBEAR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:18:52 2015 UTC,BMTH have signed a deal with Sony before sempiternal was even recorded. It didn't change seem to do much harm.

I've listened to the blessthefall track before and I'm still rather on the fence about it; I love the instrumental work, but I can't quite decide whether the cleans do it for me or not. I think my brain simply hates me, but the others don't do it for me either, with the exception of the Miss May I track, which I enjoyed a lot, thank you! I had passed on them previously after listening to I.H.E, but I will now go through their work. I liked LMTF's track In Dreams off the same album, but something didn't click with the others. Wow, maybe I am just way too picky. Thanks for the time and effort though, I really appreciate it!"

Problem with your suggestions for me is that there are no cleans, it's really a hard one for me to get over, as the only songs I've ever got into without any cleans whatsoever are the ABR in the original post and Photosphere by Crossfaith... That said, the Glass Cloud interested me slightly but the screaming style put me off a little, but I was wondering if you knew of any band that uses cleans that has sections that sound like the section starting at 1:30 - 1:53 in this one: http://youtu.be/n5wt2OOLOCg All in all, I think I tend to like stuff more in the melodic side, but thank you for your time and suggestions :)"

Metalcore,3d600b,Pvt_MJCaboose,15,Mon Jul 13 20:34:40 2015 UTC,Same here. I listened to it again today to see if it would grow on me and I might hate it more now.
Metalcore,3d600b,Brad777,3,Mon Jul 13 21:26:30 2015 UTC,It's a boring song. It doesn't surprise me though that's the direction they've been heading. They've gotten lighter every album. This sounds like something Trapt would have put out. I don't hear any metalcore influence at all. It just sounds like a generic hard rock song with an edgy ending.
Metalcore,3d600b,Chaotix247,29,Tue Jul 14 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"It's alright, but if that's the direction of the entire album, then I hate it.  I listened to nu-metal years ago and don't listen to it anymore for a reason.  I'm sick and tired of these bands turning this way, it's not fun, cool, cute, entertaining, or even different, it's been done before, it's trying to revive a dead (or latent) interest at best, and they need to have other tracks related to Sempiternal or their past albums.  I'd heavily prefer a Drown sound over Happy Song."
Metalcore,3d600b,Fabs93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I've been a huge BMTH fan for years, and I don't even care that there's no screaming in Happy Song, or that it's not ""brutal"". It's just a boring, bland song. Bring Me can do better than this. I liked Drown a lot, but this song is just just feels uninspired."
Metalcore,3d600b,Runeon12,6,Tue Jul 14 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"I surprisingly liked it. After going through comments and what not however, I also ended up realizing that I like Deftones. The fact that I went my entire life without listening to them may or may not play into the fact that I liked ""Happy Song"", but either way I still liked it.  And I actuallylikedthecheerleaders"
Metalcore,3d600b,bewareofdware,3,Mon Jul 13 21:18:20 2015 UTC,"I had a similar revelation with Deftones a couple of months ago. Their song 'Pins and Needles' came on my Pandora station and I was like ""Who the heck is this? This is amazing."" I guess it's better late than never."
Metalcore,3d600b,InsiDS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yep the slow part in ""Happy Song"", all I could hear was Deftones. It helps that I enjoy that band too so it made this song easier to listen to. Just hard to picture BTMH with this song."

Metalcore,3d600b,TheReverend5,12,Mon Jul 13 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"At first I was very confused and suprised as this was not at all what I was hoping for or expecting. The ""SPIRIT"" chanting in particular did not at all mesh well with me. With every subsequent listen I found myself enjoying the song more and more. The musicianship, vocals, and even the lyrics (a lot of the lyrics are generic and simple, but there are a few lines I enjoy) really grew on me.       I quite like the song now and can't seem to get it out of my head. I keep singing the fucking ""SPIRIT"" chants out of nowhere however I do think that the chants are the only real downfall of the song (they do fit in surprisingly well musically, I'm just not the biggest fan of them). From the second chorus when the keys come in onwards, it's fantastic (the choir part is fucking rad). The ending is great, and Oli's screams are great.     As much as I initially wanted to hate the song, I can't. It's quite different for a BMTH song (but everything post-CYB they've seems to come across like this anyway), but since its grown on me I'm very excited to hear more from them in this style even though I really wanted a heavier iteration of Sempiternal."
Metalcore,3d600b,narwal8008,2,Mon Jul 13 21:33:42 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with what you said about the choir part of the song. That to me sounds like BMTH.
Metalcore,3d600b,oscar9909,16,Mon Jul 13 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"Just listened to it fresh today with a nice pair of cans. There was some cool guitar panning effects. Mix is decent (Bendeth again?), good use of effects in addition to the instrumentals as well.    Too bad the song still fucking blows."
Metalcore,3d600b,oscar9909,14,Mon Jul 13 23:12:17 2015 UTC,The cheerleaders do get annoying but overall I enjoyed the song
Metalcore,3d600b,Zoesan,17,Mon Jul 13 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a BMTH fan but I thought Sandpit turtle was pretty solid and their best release. This song wasn't terrible but I would never choose to listen to it, it was just bland and basic. Seems maybe if they are hoping onto the nu metalcore trend."
Metalcore,3d600b,Jorgetime,4,Mon Jul 13 21:27:02 2015 UTC,"Seems maybe if they are hoping onto the nu metalcore trend.   God, I hope not. I've always looked at BMTH as the trendsetters, not the ones to jump onto trends. Plus I don't enjoy nu-metal, so that would be a double loss for me."

Metalcore,3d600b,oscar9909,8,Mon Jul 13 21:46:50 2015 UTC,The whole super atmospheric synthy weird shit didn't explode until there is a hell and sempiternal also massively influenced the riffing on albums released after.  Not to mention that suicide season is probably the original scenecore album.
Metalcore,3d600b,jglobal,2,Tue Jul 14 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"Deathcore in 2006 wasn't all that popular. Besides, Suicide Season started  that-open-chuggy-riff-thing and There is Hell/Sempiternal started the synth-atmospheric stuff. Bands that clearly drew/draw influence from them: Of Mice and Men, Architects, Asking Alexandria, The Plot in You..."
Metalcore,3d600b,budpotatoe,3,Tue Jul 14 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know man, do you really think metalcore would be as melodramatic as it has become without Bring Me The Horizon?"
Metalcore,3d600b,jglobal,10,Mon Jul 13 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"Metalcore has always been melodramatic. Listen to some early 2000's metalcore like Atreyu. In fact, for a long time people mockingly associated the genre with emo kids whining about their girlfriends. If anything, metalcore has become less melodramatic over the years with the rise of proggy elements that you see in August Burns Red, Misery Signals, ERRA and so on.   As much as I enjoy Bring Me The Horizon, I don't think they're trendsetters. They just managed to capture a big market early on with their first 2 records + all the scene girls falling in love with Oli."
Metalcore,3d600b,TheReverend5,2,Tue Jul 14 03:42:20 2015 UTC,Post hardcore has drifted a fair bit in metalcore so maybe it was always to go this way haha
Metalcore,3d600b,serjonsnow,11,Mon Jul 13 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"It's so boring, and as a band one of the worst things you can do is become boring.   For reference, I liked Drown. Different as it was, it was still a good song."

Metalcore,3d600b,nohitter21,25,Mon Jul 13 23:57:26 2015 UTC,I never called Drown metalcore.
Metalcore,3d600b,Jake2197,8,Tue Jul 14 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"LOL I don't think anybody in their right mind would call Drown metalcore. However, unlike this garbage heap of a song, Drown was fun to listen to, sing along to, and altogether more enjoyable for me (and several others from the looks of it). I posted a similar statement in the other song thread, but I'd buy an album that was all songs like Drown before I'd buy an album that was all songs like Happy Song."
Metalcore,3d600b,crazyrthendahmer,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:37 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Drown, especially as it was clear that it was just a standalone song. The fact that Happy Song is coming from the next album is why everyone hates it so much, myself included."
Metalcore,3d600b,andreasmiles23,4,Tue Jul 14 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"I love it, but I definitely could've done without the cheers. Whatever though, the song was enjoyable enough to leave me excited about a new album."
Metalcore,3d600b,Lord-Norse,8,Mon Jul 13 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"I like the song a lot, but I don't want the whole album to sound like that. It would be good as the weird/different intro song like Can You Feel My Heart was to Sempiternal though."
Metalcore,3d600b,molybdenum33,5,Mon Jul 13 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"I seem to be one of the few that really liked it. It wasn't a phenomenal song, but it was a good song to use as the first single. I see a lot of potential for some heavier songs based off the tone of the guitar, and the overall feel of the song. The lyrics aren't anything groundbreaking, but if this is more of an interlude style song on the album, then I have absolutely no complaints.   It's a good, mellow song that could be a lot of fun live. It leaves a lot of room for getting the crowd going and singing along.   I am more excited for the album after this song than I was before, and I was pretty damn excited to begin with."
Metalcore,3d600b,NervousName,3,Mon Jul 13 22:43:34 2015 UTC,"I've had a shit day and am going thru some shit recently. For some reason this song makes me feel a little better. I really like when Oli's voice changes from singing to yelling (""lets just sing along..."") the cheerleaders are annoying though. I have listened to the song like 15 times today. So you could say I like it."
Metalcore,3d600b,Morphang,3,Mon Jul 13 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"I said this in the video post, but I think this song lacks the atmospheric depth that drew me into loving their last two albums. ""Drown"" had it, and I loved that track. This song didn't convey that for me, it just felt like a shallow nu-metal track, which I'm not a fan of, so it really turned me off."
Metalcore,3d600b,undefinedcolton,3,Mon Jul 13 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"I actually really liked it, even upon first listening. Sure, it's different, but Oli said himself that they were going to be changing styles, that he didn't really want to scream as much anymore. I love the lyrics, and even though you guys don't like the cheerleaders, i thought they added something that could be interesting in a future music video, if one happens"
Metalcore,3d600b,DASboat,2,Mon Jul 13 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"In my opinion: The song isnt bad, its an ok song. I feel it's definitely the expectations I had for them, and I feel it's not up to BMTH standards given that before you could tell it was them, and they a distinct sound. Happy Song didn't even sound like BMTH to me. With all of that said, sometimes bands have that ""radio"" song they make, personally, I hope that it doesn't define what the whole album will sound like, and that it is that ""radio"" song on the album and the rest will be a heavier sound, and maybe a little closer to their sound because Happy Song sounded like Three Days Grace to me, not a bad band imo, but I liked that BMTH sound personally."
Metalcore,3d600b,thesewordsarefake,2,Mon Jul 13 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"It's alright, I guess"

Metalcore,3d600b,trilogique,2,Mon Jul 13 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I may be one of the few on here that actually enjoyed the song. Sure, it's a far cry from Sempiternal and SURELY a far cry from This Is What The Edge Of Your Seat Was Made For. Sure, it lacks the typical BMTH breakdowns. But, it's progression. To me, it feels like the combination of every clean chorus on Sempiternal put together. As long as the rest of the album sounds nothing like this did, I'm okay with this track being on there. Sempiternal is their best work to date (imo), and I hope they progress from that."
Metalcore,3d600b,dos0mething,2,Mon Jul 13 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"don't mind it. guitar riffs remind me of Issues or some kind of nu-metal. i hope the rest of the record isn't like this, but i don't expect it to be. Sempiternal was flawless."
Metalcore,3d600b,trilogique,2,Mon Jul 13 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"With the news of BMTH signing to a major label, I can't say I'm surprised by this song. Of course not all bands that sign to a major label go into a poppier direction, but it happens and I think that's what we're getting here"
Metalcore,3d600b,SnackShackit,2,Tue Jul 14 01:36:55 2015 UTC,Thing is they had been major label for their UK distribution for a while now. Speaking technically they just moved to an American major who in reality is owned by the same company(Sony) as their UK label. I think they'll switch it up a bit but to the extent that people are thinking. I wouldn't look too much into the label change just bringing everything under the same umbrella.
Metalcore,3d600b,its_a_simulation,6,Tue Jul 14 02:11:39 2015 UTC,"Phenomenal song. Loved it on the first listen. Love it even more after the 20th. Everyone seems too concerned about what they ""expected"" it to be, and not appreciating the progression this band keeps making in so many directions. Since when did songs have to be complicated and heavy to be good songs? This is a great song, with a ton of great elements. The cheers give it such a great fight song vibe. This is a banger. I love never being able to guess what direction these guys are gonna go. Constant improvement, never afraid to tackle any particular style.   Bring on the down votes. I'm stoked for this album."
Metalcore,3d600b,iSevenfold762,6,Tue Jul 14 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"That's a massive misrepresentation of what people are complaining about. People aren't bitching because it isn't heavy or complicated. This band has never put out the same album twice and we've always embraced that change because its been a change in a positive direction. Shit, the band has gotten LESS heavy and complicated as the years go on so that doesn't even make sense.   People don't like this because it sounds like every other grunge rock song you'd hear on the radio with better vocals. This isn't progression, it's an appeal to a wider market. It's generic. Whether it's representative of the album remains to be seen, but initial impressions look worrisome.    You are free to like it, but please stop pretending like everyone's criticism is something it isn't."
Metalcore,3d600b,its_a_simulation,-6,Tue Jul 14 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"never put out the same album twice    I'm sorry, semipiternal and there is a hell would like a word with you."
Metalcore,3d600b,iSevenfold762,8,Tue Jul 14 04:33:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but no. Those are not the same album at all.   In fact, There Is A Hell... has more in common with Suicide Season than it does Sempiternal. All of those albums are undoubtedly BMTH, but they are all progressions on previous albums... except this song."
Metalcore,3d600b,Foxxxhound117,2,Tue Jul 14 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"I like it. I love the chorus and the final ~1minute kicks ass. The ending is really good. The rest of the song is okay, and I like the chant. Reminds me of mobSCENE.  It feels like a song that I'll listen to lots (which I am) and then probably die out and won't listen much. And I still listen to almost all of BMTH. I never skip it if it comes up.   I think it's a really good song, but just a good song in retrospect to BMTH. They definitely have better songs, but I really enjoy the happy mood of the song but still kicks ass. Again, the final minute or so of the song is fucking amazing in my opinion."
Metalcore,3d600b,dr_ritter,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:46 2015 UTC,"I'm late on this thread but I feel that we should also think about the name of the song. It's called ""Happy Song"". Happy. Happy in relation to what, the rest of the album? That could suggest a heavier, angrier and more raw album."

Metalcore,3d600b,cCattle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:22:20 2015 UTC,I don't particularly love it or hate it but it's certainly no Crucify Me or Shadow Moses.  I was going to say that I doubt I'll find myself singing it during quieter moments but what I've found is the S.P.I.R.I.T. spelling has got me singing Faith No More's 'Be Aggressive' instead...
Metalcore,3d600b,Jorgetime,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"It's not an awful song, and I'd probably like it if it was released by Three Days Grace or Rise Against. But it really doesn't feel like a BMTH song, everything about it is overproduced, the vocals are kinda forced and have a lot of filters/gates on them, the cheerleader sampling is annoying, etc. It all feels like an appeal to a wider market, a song that could easily get played on BBC Radio 1 in the afternoon, and when I compare it to the likes of Anthem or Blacklist, it makes me rather sad. I've closely followed BMTH since Suicide Season, so to see them go to this level of radio-esque rock, is rather depressing. At least we (the UK) still have Architects, Oceans Ate Alaska, Bury Tomorrow, While She Sleeps, etc, all of whom put out consistently good releases."

This just isn't growing on me any. Don't Look Down was different, and jarred me at first, but grew on me as a fun little experiment after a few days. It was also kinda cool seeing them still be tied with DnB; like with Suicide Season's rerelease.  Drown felt more like a continuation of Sempiternal, which I was perfectly ok with. I'm on the fence more than before. I've always said Sempiternal set the bar too high, I don't think they'll be able to surpass it. Still gonna wait for the new album to make a final opinion, but I feel like this will be on where I pick and choose my songs for playlists carefully."
Metalcore,3d600b,mikeytruelove,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:37:24 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is going to not like it at first, but then it will grow on them like Drown did. From what I recall not many people liked drown when it first came out. Now after this song everybody seems to reference drown as it being better then this. Yes they are changing direction and it doesn't sound anything like their previous work but we should just give it time. We should look at the song as a whole though, and not compare it to their past work. I personally like it, though I can see why others don't."

Sure it was different, and I'm not too fond of bands taking the nu metal approach to new songs, but I thought it was good. Another good stadium type song, and the cheerleader chant I thought was kind of clever and cheeky, not to mention it just begs to be shouted by the audience. Overall if someone were to ask me to rate the song (which no one has, but fuck em, right?) I'd give it a 7. Good not great. I hope the rest of the album has enough variation in the song styles; I don't particularly want more than one song that's as nu metal as this one. I mean, even Antivist started off more nu metal, but they decided to tone down that aspect because it just wasn't right.   Unlike other comments I see (not to disparage them) I don't hope or wish that the album is heavier than drown or even sempiternal, I just hope that we see the quality of songwriting and emotional impact of sempiternal or there is a hell."

Some bands completely fuck up and become flat. Others manage to make the music seem genuinely impressive and catcy while being more simplistic. Good example of this would be new I The Mighty album Connector, bad example - WCAR self-titled."

It's understandable for a band to want to change their sound and evolve over time, but not all musical evolution is for the best, in my opinion.

The instruments do sound like shit and oli sounds like a butt rocker let's face it. Even if they were going for radio sound it still is just uninteresting. Not like it matters because practically anything with this sound will get played because the radio is so full of the same shit they jizz when any band with a name comes out with something, especially one like bmth with hype behind them."

Metalcore,3d73q0,deadmanRise,9,Tue Jul 14 01:08:45 2015 UTC,basically take the heaviest bands you listen to and start practicing their songs. notice patterns and start writing your own shit based around it.
Metalcore,3d73q0,moshlyfe,2,Tue Jul 14 02:59:43 2015 UTC,"Been writing music for ~8 years and this is legit what I've done. Might sound odd, but playing others' songs helps you figure out music writing pretty nicely."

Metalcore,3d73q0,Rynaldo34,3,Tue Jul 14 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Okay you have 2 options.   1.)Long hardcore buildups with guitars tuned down like 13 steps and 8 strings, focusing on chugging and 808 bass drops (think like Breakdown of Sanity)  2.)Focus on songwriting and the natural progression of a song. J B Brubaker said in an interview once that if everything is heavy, nothing is really heavy....  If you play a song in the key of G, so 5 frets up from an open D in standard drop d tuning, then for the breakdown you finally just let loose and blast those open strings, it's gonna sound so much heavier than the rest of the song. Honestly, my best way to describe this would be ABR's Joy to the World. The breakdown is stupid heavy in comparison to the rest of the song because they don't rely on the open strings until then. Check it out."
Metalcore,3d73q0,oscar9909,2,Tue Jul 14 02:58:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to lie chugs and breakdowns are heavy but you have to use them right, and that differs on person to person. The heaviest things to me are pounding sludge or whatever Swans are and then stuff like Nails and Full Of Hell.   So a very thick, dense guitar tone, filthy bass with blistering bpast beats or slow drumming. I think good production plays a huge role as well.  Just a fan's opinion."
Metalcore,3d73q0,DavidR525,2,Tue Jul 14 03:27:31 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you mean on guitar. Most bands that play in Drop D or C use the Phyrigian and Mixolydian scales which have an aggressive-ish sound and allow you to chug the sixth string for anything with it still working. Trivium songs use this a lot
Metalcore,3d73q0,dr_ritter,2,Tue Jul 14 03:47:00 2015 UTC,scream BLEGH in the mic and smash your drums as hard as you can

Metalcore,3d73q0,andreasmiles23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:52:02 2015 UTC,It's honestly all about the build-ups. Bands in drop z tuning but only do chugs and breakdowns won't ever sound as heavy as someone in drop d who's breakdown hits after a proper buildup
Metalcore,3d73q0,SlLv3R,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of the ""heavy"" elements in a song rely solely on song structure. Things like downtuning CAN make you sound ""heavier"" but even a song in a major key tuned to drop G# is going to sound happy. Downtuning for me should be done to help work with a clean vocalist to more strongly accompany his/her voice.  If you don't believe me here's a better example of what I'm saying  Songs in ""darker"" keys tend to sound more crushingly brutal when used correctly. The natural minor, harmonic minor, hungarian minor, and diminished scale are all scales that first come to mind when I work on a heavier piece of music.  Songs that flow well and are structured well feel more heavy when the heavy parts come in. A breakdown played after a well executed buildup will be a lot heavier than a breakdown for the sake of playing a breakdown."
Metalcore,3d73q0,havoktheorem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:45:00 2015 UTC,"You can't make heavy by formula, IMO. A feeling of horror comes from the unexpected.   However, i always find double kick beats with staccato guitar quite heavy sounding.   Examples:  Versus  Not metalcore but this song sounds fucking evil at the start."
Metalcore,3d73q0,Whywhypizzapie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:24:19 2015 UTC,Figure out the tropes and commonly used parts in brutal shit that are actually effective them incorporate them into your sound.
Metalcore,3d73q0,TheWallaby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:59:06 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is to learn that just because it's in a lower tuning doesn't make it inherently heavier. A great writer can make standard sound heavier than some crab core band in drop A just slamming open notes. A great riff will not only sound heavier, but have more impact than just chugging open strings. Especially if you use good riffing to build up to a breakdown. When it comes to other parts of the music, bass that follows either its own riff or a variation on the guitar riff will give the song much more ""meat"" than if it is simply rhythmically chugging or following the guitar riff to a tee. Drums that aren't simply fast for the sake of speed and instead impart a unique pace and flow to the song will help. Utilize fills and double kicks to give sections punch rather than spamming them throughout the whole song (not to say constant double kicks isn't a good thing, i.e. Parallels by As I Lay Dying)"
Metalcore,3d73q0,jesusofpaign,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:53:42 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to your favorite bands' heavy riffs. Listen to the rhythm as much as the note choice, and take note of the technique. Other than that, just practice a lot I guess. But definitely listen to a lot of heavy songs and try to figure out why and how they're heavy. And remember a lot of the heaviness comes from the layering of guitars and bass, as well as the drum technique."

If this record and them being on Warped all summer don't blow them up over here I'm gonna be really disappointed in the US scene.   His English is really starting to sound good.   And it looks like Caleb Shomo is gonna be on one of the tracks of this record, that should be kinda cool!"
Metalcore,3d3xcp,longhair_dude,6,Mon Jul 13 09:41:41 2015 UTC,"Kenta is providing screams and cleans. If you want to hear more of his cleans, check out their Madness EP which they released last year :)   Coincidentally, all three tracks off the Madness EP are attached to Xeno as bonus tracks which makes sense considering it didn't receive an international release."
Metalcore,3d3xcp,reincarnvte,3,Mon Jul 13 09:56:59 2015 UTC,"Probably worth noting that when Crossfaith are live, both Kentra and Terufumi do vocals (both clean and screamed). And cheers for mentioning the Madness EP, I actually didn't know that it even existed until this morning."
Metalcore,3d3xcp,Ne0nBlur,3,Mon Jul 13 11:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely! Teru has a fierce set of pipes on him, will be cool to see how he fits in singing Xeno live. Enjoy Madness!"
Metalcore,3d3xcp,reincarnvte,2,Mon Jul 13 12:47:32 2015 UTC,It's weird to me when you guys call that a ep. In japan thats whats known as a maxi single. Usually there's the single that'll be on the cd than 2 B side songs that wont be on the cd(except in the case of the Xeno cd it will be). A EP in japan is called a mini album unless its actually specified by the band as a EP.

Metalcore,3d3xcp,Equilibriumx,3,Mon Jul 13 12:28:49 2015 UTC,But Masato from Coldrain is half caucasian and he writes perfect english lyrics and their band is great live and the songs are awesome but they aren't nowhere near as big :( Evolve if you don't know them. should have a new album or ep coming this year too. Can't wait.
Metalcore,3d3xcp,Dwesk,3,Mon Jul 13 14:10:27 2015 UTC,"I meant it more like it's one of the contributing things why they are international. They make amazing music, which is the bigger part there."

Metalcore,3d3xcp,Dwesk,2,Mon Jul 13 14:16:31 2015 UTC,Imo Coldrains earlier stuff was way better. The second record  (There was adrenaline on it etc.) was perfect. Also We're not alone <3
Metalcore,3d3xcp,Chazy89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:28:10 2015 UTC,They kind of go back and forth but they're still a solid band and they sound even better live imo. They definitely sound heavier live. Plus Masato is a great frontman and pulls off both clean and harsh vocals very well.
Metalcore,3d3xcp,Dwesk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, seen em live several times and met Masato once. Still is a bummer that they play little to no old songs. I'd love we're not alone, adrenaline or 8am live."

Best Newcomer: Now and on Earth, which I think is able to contest many of the top albums thus far into the year (Including the one below). I'm expecting huge things from these guys, and I'm easily willing to call that they'll be a front-runner in the genre after 1-2 more releases.   Best Album (from a solidified band): The one and only ABR. FIFAP is  a massive hit, bringing back some heaviness from the earlier albums and the creativity from R&R.  Notables for me coming in the second half (AND ALL IN SEPTEMBER): PWD, Atreyu and Crossfaith."

Metalcore,3d6q4w,misserray,5,Mon Jul 13 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"Several years ago Crucify Me popped up on Spotify Radio. I ended up skipping it because I really didn't like it (at the time, the 'heaviest' metalcore I listened to was CTE). A bit later Don't Go came on, which was basically everything I wanted from a metalcore song at the time -- slow, powerful, symphonic elements, dark, etc. So I ended up listening to There Is A Hell... in its entirety and now it's my favorite metalcore album.  Also, in the months leading up to the release of Old Souls, I could not stand Blood Moon. Then the album came out and somewhere along the line it migrated from the bottom of the list to the top of the list."

Fast forward 2 months I'm starting to enjoy it, it's unique it's standing out and fast forward this year I love it, top 2 albums for me.  Just the genre of grind was the same case above except I don't enjoy it as much as Converge.  Every Time I Die is another metalcore band who I initially saw as being some generic metalcore band purely as they had cleans but after giving them a proper listen I started to enjoy it a whole more, now they are one of my most played artists.  And finally Black Sabbath, I always disliked them growing up but I have been enjoying their early work a lot recently."
Metalcore,3d6q4w,oscar9909,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:00 2015 UTC,Exact same thing with converge. First song i heard was No Heroes and i thought it was god awful. Theyre my 2nd most listened to band now

When I first heard it I thought it was okay but not great, but I read through the comments and people were like ""if you think his vocals are harsh here listen to the saddest day"" and that song blew me away and led to me giving Jane Doe a few more spins."

Its all good. Cant say ive heard much deathcore tho.  Lol for me i only heard jane doe after id already got into them through AWLWLB but loads of people say its their hardest to digest.

Iirc on last fm my top genres were Hardcore, Mathcore, Metalcore, Post Hardcore then Grindcore or Experimental. I've struggled to find deathcore I've enjoyed but animosity and the red chord are both solid.   I just always was recommended Jane Doe so it was the album I went to and AWLWLB took me a bit to get accustomed and same with Axe to Fall. I can't wait for the new album it's been almost 3 years."
Metalcore,3d6q4w,oscar9909,2,Tue Jul 14 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"First time I listened to Jane Doe by Converge I was like ""what the fuck is this?!"", and now some years later, it's definitely on my top 5 albums of all time. I can't remember how I realised what a masterpiece it is, but I can assure that this album completely changed the way I listened to music."
Metalcore,3d6q4w,mathcu,2,Mon Jul 13 23:46:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly the same thing as me, Jane Doe has fully changed the way I see and appreciate music. It's hard to describe how it changed my taste, but it allowed me to value music that goes completely against what is expected in music like on first listening it was almost just noise to me. It's one of the few albums I believe every person who listens to heavy/aggressive music should give a go."

For example:  ""You're not alone, you're with me"" - OM&M - You're Not Alone  ""We won't fall to our knees.

Metalcore,3d3psy,djlykaen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:11:56 2015 UTC,I just started and a easy setup (if your just doing vocals) is a Scarlett Solo interface and a shure sm58 mic. The interface comes with recording software already so that's pretty cool. Ofc you could get a better microphone if you want but it's not bad to start off.

Definitely a Shure SM58 and a pop filter, Audacity or Logic Pro 9/X (if you have the money for Logic), and an XLR to USB adapter. That was my first setup and it worked well for me at the time."

Metalcore,3d19kh,thesewordsarefake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:31:33 2015 UTC,I literally was about to post this. Great song! Don't see why Sumerian has there panties in a bunch.
Metalcore,3d19kh,BinaryWork,4,Sun Jul 12 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't like Sumerian Records that much, and what they are doing doesn't make sense from a contract point of view. But I could be wrong and this is mostly speculation.  Most of this is speculation based on how most music labels operate. but a lot of labels have it in the artist contract that they have exclusive access/control to a specific band/band members/brand name. Asking Alexandria is a big brand name in the scene, so Sumerian wants to be compensated since they ""own"" the brand name and all members in it to an extent when the name they own is used fin other ways, such as Forever in Combat using it in the title of their song because this brand name can draw money and someone else is using it to generate money without giving any to Sumerian.  However, at the time this song was created, Denis was a free agent(to my knowledge), not contracted to Sumerian Records and was compensated for his contribution to the song. I'm not a lawyer, but most contracts only apply to current and future operations of a brand name not past deals(unless specifically stated). Therefore, I see no way Sumerian has a legal claim to Denis' past work(also even if Denis could cede ownership over past work he can't do so over past work that he sold and is owned by another party).   Maybe Sumerian says that in the contract Denis gave them ownership over past works(which doesn't make sense since Sumerian already owns Make Me Famous and Down & Dirty and the only other left is random solo stuff like this Forever In Combat feature). But that wouldn't work because the compensation from FIC to Denis means that FIC bought the feature form Denis and now owns it and can keep any money generated from the song.  tl;dr Sumerian being dicks because they are a big name and can threaten legal action(which appears to have no basis) to an independent band because they are small.  I understand Sumerian wanting to protect their brand that they own, but this is not the way to do it nor do they have any basis for it(or so it appears)."

Then they said there was going to be an LP in 2014, but they decided to make it an EP. Then they said there was going to be news about it in the spring this year, which we never got. At this rate we aren't even going to get that EP until next year.   I'm hoping it'll all be worth it in the end, but it's kinda silly how long they're taking.

Metalcore,3cvnao,thesewordsarefake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:48:10 2015 UTC,If that is true then what a shitty thing for them to do. I didn't even know that their album before know hope was Rise's. I thought that they changed styles after Rise signed them.

Metalcore,3cwdvw,hungryjack128,2,Sat Jul 11 11:06:28 2015 UTC,I honestly didn't like the new ABR album. The singles were awesome but the terrible interludes killed the flow of the album for me. The gypsy music in Separating the Seas was bad enough but when Majoring in Minors hit the country western break I shut the album off.
Metalcore,3cwdvw,Pvt_MJCaboose,11,Sat Jul 11 17:08:34 2015 UTC,Oh god the Majoring the Minors interlude is amazing. It's even better in the acoustic version. This album oozed passion for me and I thoroughly enjoy the interludes.  I mean look at Everlasting Ending. Jesus what a beautiful song.
Metalcore,3cwdvw,newschoolerz,6,Sat Jul 11 17:49:19 2015 UTC,"The break in Everlasting Ending is so beautiful. I don't mean to come off as condescending but I think the breaks are over a lot of people's heads. Sonically they fit each song perfectly, and I can't help but think that if they had just put cookie cutter breakdowns there instead, a lot of people who are complaining would love it."
Metalcore,3cwdvw,TheWallaby,6,Sat Jul 11 17:58:26 2015 UTC,"See the issue that I had is that I don't think they fit the song perfectly. For example, I enjoy the flamenco break in Bulls in the Bronx by PTV because it feels like it fits in that song. But the interludes here just felt disconnected and out of place from the rest of the song."
Metalcore,3cwdvw,Pvt_MJCaboose,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:07:31 2015 UTC,I agree. The lack of typical breakdowns in every song really made the ones they did do sound awesome. Blackwood's intro breakdown is sick as hell

Metalcore,3ctk55,Pussy_Rolls270,14,Fri Jul 10 19:40:10 2015 UTC,Guard your face when you listen to Iliaster (More than Skin) because they'll shred it right off at 2:15.
Metalcore,3ctk55,Galaxyass,6,Fri Jul 10 19:53:39 2015 UTC,If that's the case then I assume you died at end of Till The End.
Metalcore,3ctk55,Runeon12,22,Fri Jul 10 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"Phinehas makes it possible to live without As I Lay Dying. The album is fantastic, Sean's vocals are on point and the instrumentation is varied and always on top of its game."
Metalcore,3ctk55,shini333,5,Fri Jul 10 19:30:11 2015 UTC,Your comment will make me check them out. I love As I Lay Dying.
Metalcore,3ctk55,Jake2197,5,Sat Jul 11 04:32:51 2015 UTC,"They aren't very much like As I Lay Dying, very different sound, but the skill of the musicians is very much on par with AILD."
Metalcore,3ctk55,thedispairfactor,2,Sat Jul 11 05:44:49 2015 UTC,I definitely get an AILD feeling from Phinehas. Especially on Thegodmachine. Like Shadows are Security era AILD. But now Phinehas have definitely evolved into their own
Metalcore,3ctk55,Flayvaboi,16,Sat Jul 11 10:49:12 2015 UTC,"In short, it's absolutely spectacular.  It has everything that you would expect from Phinehas and then some. Fast and punchy riffs, breakdowns that hit like a truck, and shredding guitar solos that make my jaw drop. While also incorporating a surprising large amount of slower, softer moments that add a lot of atmosphere that I honestly didn't expect.  I feel like the interludes make this a bad album to have on shuffle. It seems like album is structured very well to be listened in the listed order to have that perfect mixed of heavy and soft. While they have used interludes before, I feel like they were more consistent with them in this album and with their softer portions in general.  I did come for the heavy part of Phinehas and i was not disappointed in the least. I jumped in my chair a bit when I first heard White Livered, It caught me off guard to hear an intro like that. Overall, I had very high expectations for this album and they were gloriously met and exceeded. Phinehas belongs with the kings of metalcore.  Favorite songs: White Livered, Tetelestai, Forever West, Iliastar, Till The End, and the rest of the album.  Edit: Spelling"
Metalcore,3ctk55,gussly1,14,Fri Jul 10 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"They progress and progress with each album. Daniel Gailey's guitar work is something incredible and new while still staying true to the Phinehas sound. It is safe to say there is something fresh about it. Its evident that Sean has switched up his vocal style a bit. His lows are definitely different, yet nevertheless filthy. His cleans have a certain grit to them that I really enjoy. Some tracks are your standard heavy-hitting metalcore such as Dead Choir, Truth Be Told, and Forever West. They also have some offensively heavy songs ridden with dirty riffs, aggressive vocals, and just relentless chugging (White Livered, Tetelestai, Coup de Grace (one of the craziest guitar solos I've heard in a while), & Iliaster).  With that being said, I feel as though the song ""Seven"" is the most notable on the album. It starts off really slow and soft, showcasing Sean's voice, before culminating into one of the heaviest parts of the record. It follows a similar formula that a few of their past songs, such as Dyson Sphere and Wishing Well, have used. Wherein the song begins as calm and haunting, then just continues to build off of itself, ultimately become an ear-pummeling anthem strewn with emotion and agression.   Overall, its an amazing album and has exceeded by expectations, which had been quite high going into the record."
Metalcore,3ctk55,I_Nut_In_Butts,11,Fri Jul 10 18:12:16 2015 UTC,I had only first checked them out today on spotify...  They are....wipes away tear.... one of the best things to happen to Metalcore.  The guitar work is just out of this world. The screamer has some powerful lows. It's really just a masterpiece all around.   I'll be jamming this album for a long time for sure.
Metalcore,3ctk55,Nirchana,10,Fri Jul 10 19:48:18 2015 UTC,It feels like I've been waiting what feels like ages for this album and i and not disappointed with the results. It all flows so well together and i feel like they've poured their heart and soul into this record. Phinehas deserves more attention and should be considered one of the best metalcore bands around
Metalcore,3ctk55,gaurnere,11,Fri Jul 10 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love this album. This is good metalcore.   The songwriting is on point and I really like the lyrical aspects covered in the album. The production is super clear and crisp which makes it even more enjoyable to listen to.  The only thing I'm not huge on is the interludes, just simply because they don't seem to flow, but I guess they do provide a nice break from all the musical insanity that's going on.  Favorite songs as of now: White Livered, Evening Gray and Morning Red, Iliaster (More Than Skin), Dead Choir and Seven, but I really enjoy the whole album."
Metalcore,3ctk55,Jaboaflame,6,Fri Jul 10 23:02:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because they cater to my favorite aspects of metalcore in which they have amazing leads, amazing and natural transitions from cleans to screams, and just some plain heavy riffs, but so far this is my AOTY, even more so than ABR's newest."

Metalcore,3ctk55,Nirchana,5,Sat Jul 11 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"It's pretty dang great! To be honest, I was slightly disappointed with their second release after thegodmachine, but this definitely restored my faith in them. Daniel is awesome and it shows, although I do dearly miss Becoming the Archetype, I'm glad he's still doing stuff. Great album!! Seven is fantastic and a huge step up, vocals-wise from before."
Metalcore,3ctk55,Zackeezy116,5,Fri Jul 10 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"Im with you on that. ""the last word is yours to speak"" is still a good album but imo it was nothing compared to thegodmachine. Thegodmachine just flowed so well together that it felt like one big song instead of individual tracks."
Metalcore,3ctk55,alexxxpoling,4,Sat Jul 11 00:03:13 2015 UTC,I spent my first pay check to buy this album and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  When Truth Be Told came on I knew this was money well spent.
Metalcore,3ctk55,Thoketan,5,Sat Jul 11 01:32:10 2015 UTC,Unfourtanatley my pre order didnt come in today but I streamed the album and all i can say is wow. Honestly I started listening to them when i heard the sighned to artery and really liked their old stuff but this is incredibly solid. The gutair work is the best in the scene and the way the lyrics move with the riffs is incredible. Seriously some moments that almost made me tear up. This and matriarch are the best releases of the year and I didn't know the bands before those albums
Metalcore,3ctk55,defend_pizza,5,Sat Jul 11 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to the album today since about lunchtime, got through it about 3 times. I still cant decide which song is the best. Even having listening to Dead Choir, Teletestai and Truth be Told, I still have problems picking a favorite.   White Livered is just a face melt, Seven is badass composition and play, Truth be Told is disgusting technicality, and I've had the ""We would all be dead"" breakdown from Dead Choir stuck in my head all day.  I'm excited to keep on listening to it for a while to come. Panhammer is still my favorite Phinehas song, but this album provides lots of ammunition for workout and hype playlists. Im happy.  The screaming lows are just gnarly, and the cleans arent overdone, like TLWIYTS.  I would rate it about 4.5/5 right now?  Also, Teletestai sounds a LOT like Native Blood. The whole erie run is very similar."
Metalcore,3ctk55,Raxyn13,6,Sat Jul 11 02:55:09 2015 UTC,"This is some good shit. I have never listened to them before and this is just blowing my tits off. Why haven't I listened to them before? Hot damn! I'm excited to have become a fan of them. Their guitars are ferocious, the instrumentation is just tremendous. The vocalist and got some nuts. Great vocals coming out of that guy. Wow guys this album is just a banger."
Metalcore,3ctk55,TDWP_FTW,3,Sat Jul 11 03:28:02 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of really good music, and I'm gonna give it a ton more listening time I'm sure, but I can't help but be a little disappointed in the production on it. They had their noise gate turned up too hard on the close, I think, because the breakdowns just sound so inorganic. Lots of hard-closes. I dunno, it's really good, but that took away from it a bit for me."
Metalcore,3ctk55,UncommonSense0,3,Sat Jul 11 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"Really like all of the ""actual"" songs, but the interludes are...yeah...  My personal favorites off of the album are White Livered, Coup De Grace, and Seven.  I definitely think it's a lot better than The Last Word Is Yours To Speak, but I still think Thegodmachine is their best album."
Metalcore,3ctk55,papertigers,3,Sat Jul 11 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of band/album is really hoping to discover.  I really wanted an As I Lay Dying, riff driven band with great vocals, and nice song structure along with some creative chugs.  This album fucking kills it"

Metalcore,3cvhw4,Corruptiion,2,Sat Jul 11 07:10:45 2015 UTC,I was kind of bummed at the Milwaukee date of Mayhem. They knocked TDWP down to the lower stage as the headliner which knocked whitechapel down as an opener for that stage. They both had to decrease their setlists because of this which was super disappointing.

Metalcore,3csagk,Balistix,2,Fri Jul 10 19:16:13 2015 UTC,"Many many riffs, bone crushing lows from Sean, sweet melodic cleans on their slower/acoustic songs, and mind melting, face disintegrating solos."

This record is on Apple Music as well (for those that have it). My brother actually just interviewed those guys 2 weeks ago. They talked about the new album a little bit and some of their worst shows that they've played in the rain and heat. Anyway, check it out if you want!  http://decentchristiantalk.com/2015/07/08/talking-to-phinehas/  EDIT: Added a line."

That's when I heard shit from their Rebel album. What in the Fuck is that shit? How and when did they go from that garbage to this album?  I'm all for the message they want to give, but the music was just pure hot garbage.  Most of the other albums are good to, but dang that early shit was horrible."

Metalcore,3crlvh,top_KeK_420,7,Fri Jul 10 06:02:02 2015 UTC,"Can we get some legit discussion going here? So far its only jerking and ""Omq so amazinnn""  How were Jared screams? Did beau's vocals change a lot ? For good or for worse ?"
Metalcore,3crlvh,Ridley290,11,Fri Jul 10 10:44:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that as I listened. Comparing it only to ""You Wear A Crown..."" since that was their lead single from Hollow Bodies:  This song doesn't get me as pumped up, which isn't a bad thing. Different songs have different themes, and YWAK was more of fight song and this is more of a... Keep moving? song. Think Mosh Pit (people bashing each other in the heads) vs a circle pit (sprinting in circles and trampling people). You can throw down to both, but slightly different ways. (This makes sense in my head, sorry if it sounds stupid when you're reading it :P)  Jared's screams sound a lot less strained, like he got his technique down perfectly and won't break a vocal cord at any given moment. I like both styles, but I think I prefer Up In Flames to YWAK.   Beau's vocals seemed to have been dropped down into a more comfortable range. Hell its still damn high, but his tone just sounds a lot more mature in this song vs. his previous songs. Thank God for that, I love Beau, he puts on an amazing show and sings perfectly live, but Awakening and Witness (Never actually did a full listen-through of His Last Walk) were hard to listen to for extended periods of time; his voice just got annoying after a while. Even Hollow Bodies got a little annoying at times to me, but not to the point where I'd have to throw it in a playlist with other bands to get a break (like with the previous two albums). If this is indicative of his vocal style for this record, I'm pretty sure this will be my favorite album by them.  Overall this seems toned down a little bit from Hollow Bodies, which again, not a bad thing. It's still heavy as hell, just a little more legato. I've got high hopes for this album. Hollow Bodies was amazing, and it seems they took everything good from that album and evolved it. Should be one hell of an adventure seeing them on Warped this year."
Metalcore,3crlvh,AndroidAaron,6,Fri Jul 10 11:04:47 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, His Last Walk is with Craig Mabbit and not with Beau. Still a good album, and I definitely recommend giving it a listen."
Metalcore,3crlvh,Ridley290,2,Fri Jul 10 12:30:33 2015 UTC,"Oh shit I forgot Craig was even in BTF. Well, good thing I didn't use His Last Walk in my comparison then!"
Metalcore,3crlvh,MrLilZilla,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:02:45 2015 UTC,You should definitely listen to that album though. It kicks ass & is Craig's best vocal performance.

Metalcore,3crlvh,ssforever,2,Fri Jul 10 14:03:06 2015 UTC,I would agree. It sounds like they're taking that next step musically. There always stand out with their intensity. I need to see them live again.
Metalcore,3crlvh,hitokiri-battousai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"BTF isn't my all time favorite band but they are a band that I do have their full discography and listen to them a decent amount. I agree with what you said about Beau's vocals however I'm the opposite with the way I care for them lol. I personally like his first two album styles than the more recent. I think he showed more range in the older stuff and there wasn't any auto tune. He is still a great vocalist and can hit all those old highs live. But in their newer material that's been lacking. I also agree with the screaming for Jared. I was never a fan of his screams. They sound so forced and idk ""wrong""? But live he sounds great, deep, brutal, in control. Idk if it's an effect he uses while recording or what to get that sound but I feel like he is finally taking a step in the right direction with his screaming. I hope the rest of the album stands out more. This song just seemed like they were playing it safe releasing your typical generic warped tour song."
Metalcore,3crlvh,statusnone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"Jareds screams are on point as usual. I think they go perfectly with the style/mixing. Beau's vocals seems to have a bit of work done in the studio, but they sound great and to be honest they sound more smooth than usual, which I'm more than ok with.  Matt is proving yet again that hes a fantastic drummer.  It's hard to tell from just one song, but I have a feeling this album will have a bit more guitar riffs than usual, and a few songs that blow us all out of the water"
Metalcore,3crlvh,Slaughterhouse451,7,Fri Jul 10 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"You're not the victim, you're my parasite.  Jesus fuck they are incredible.

Metalcore,3crlvh,Vcom561,3,Fri Jul 10 12:37:48 2015 UTC,"Just going off of the chorus, it seems that the lyrics may just be talking about anyone who may be a bad influence on your life. Whether thats a bad relationship or just a bad friend  Thats just the vibe i get from the chorus"
Metalcore,3crlvh,muyfeo,2,Fri Jul 10 19:59:32 2015 UTC,"I think they all have a say in the lyrics. I'm not sure who contributes more, but this is definitely not about Lights. As far as I know, they're all in happy relationships. It could be about an ex friend; I can attest to the fact that friends can be parasites sometimes."

I would also suggest Family Force 5, Icon for Hire and Memphis May Fire. They all put on fantastic shows and are totally worth seeing."
Metalcore,3ctv1w,longhair_dude,2,Fri Jul 10 19:28:01 2015 UTC,Icon For Hire is a must see for me. They're so good live.

Metalcore,3ctv1w,longhair_dude,3,Fri Jul 10 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"No problem man! They definitely fit into the YouthGroupCore area of the warped scene, but they have some incredibly fun music and have a great live show.

ABR and MMI were both excellent and you should definitely see them. AA were kind of low energy but they still sounded great and I enjoyed their set a lot. I saw part of Attilla's set and it was honestly terrible, I wouldn't prioritize them. BTF had a really good set I would recommend seeing them. I don't know if you're into Silverstein, Pierce the Veil or The Wonder Years but they had the best shows of the day in my opinion."
Metalcore,3cqcwo,Atluuuus,19,Thu Jul 9 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be that guy, but I honestly think they need to move out of their comfort zone. Every album has basically the same formula. Now that Troy isn't in the band anymore, maybe things will be changed since Troy was a huge part in the writing process. I am not saying they are getting worse at all, I am saying that after listening to this band for a few years I would like to hear something fresh and unexpected from these guys."

Metalcore,3cqcwo,TheNewerMcRib,0,Fri Jul 10 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"I think if you actually listen to all them a few times (not saying you havent) then they each become totally different ,its like saying taylor swifts songs are all the same ,they are the same because its by the same artist. I guess we cant do anything till a new album which i think is due mid 2016"

Metalcore,3cqcwo,MattBower,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:30:57 2015 UTC,"Idk maybe its just me or every single riff they've written pst-Youngbloods is pretty much exactly the same shit over and over with just minor chord changes here and there. This song is the same ""rolling"" low chords that just make it sound like there's three drummers kicking double bass. It just sounds like white noise after a while.   Basically what I'm saying is I would enjoy this a lot more if they stepped out of their comfort zone.  I'm not hating. I like TAA, don't get me wrong. Just trying to inspire some discussion here."
Metalcore,3cqcwo,MavericK_96,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"You're right. A lot of TAA songs sound very similar. I bought the new album on a whim and couldn't tell when one song ended and another began because they all sound so similar. This is a good thing if you like that sort of album, but I personally don't like the style. Still a killer live performance if you get the chance."

Metalcore,3crsan,MavericK_96,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"I thought the guys from Of Glaciers and Silence did pretty good (if a little generic) auditions.  Anyone know what they are doing now? I think both bands are done, which is a shame because their full lengths are sick."
Metalcore,3cpnhs,Martin9714,6,Thu Jul 9 19:43:41 2015 UTC,YES I LOVE THESE VIDEOS!!
Metalcore,3cpnhs,immortalis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, these guys are super talented! Check out the play through of Identity if you haven't."
Metalcore,3cpnhs,killdoom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:08:16 2015 UTC,They really jazz me up
Metalcore,3cpnhs,GMC1377,3,Fri Jul 10 00:04:34 2015 UTC,Brent is probably under appreciated for how good of a guitarist he is. JB gets the solos but I'm sure Brent could do them as well.
Metalcore,3cpnhs,BatDadded,2,Fri Jul 10 04:28:50 2015 UTC,Damn that was so sick. I still watch their live show on Youtube all the time.
Metalcore,3cpnhs,thedispairfactor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:48:49 2015 UTC,These videos just make me want them to release an instrumental version of the new album
Metalcore,3crvfs,Thesalvianaffliction,3,Fri Jul 10 07:17:12 2015 UTC,http://open.spotify.com/user/j.munos/playlist/5QoZH8WcHBLm692n9y3Kmg its a really unorganized playlist ive been slowly adding onto for a couple of months for myself and friends but hope you can find some new catchy tunes there :)
Metalcore,3crvfs,justin8087,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:39:34 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks man!
Metalcore,3crvfs,Namerok,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:08:04 2015 UTC,https://open.spotify.com/user/12121550835/playlist/6bNQ5Truznx55bDdcblWrr  This is the one I use when I workout hence the playlist name. I add to it pretty frequently. It's not ALL metalcore but most of it. I have a few heavy rock songs and some alternative songs I find catchy in there as well but i would say 90-95% is metalcore.
Metalcore,3cqaqy,lucashasbanter,8,Thu Jul 9 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"Dammit, ROT13 was my go-to first step for all of these clues, and the one time the clue actually requires it I miss it :(  On another note though I am not really a fan of these lyrics"
Metalcore,3cqaqy,TheSuperbOwlCometh,5,Thu Jul 9 22:53:59 2015 UTC,Yeah the lyrics aren't that great tbh...
Metalcore,3cqaqy,xapplin,8,Thu Jul 9 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Spent all morning cracking it, only to find out the answer was on his bio.

Metalcore,3cqaqy,NKLhaxor,5,Fri Jul 10 03:28:24 2015 UTC,Those are some really meh lyrics.
Metalcore,3cqaqy,ManWithoutModem,4,Fri Jul 10 12:46:26 2015 UTC,this is some george orwell level stuff
Metalcore,3cqaqy,Spider-Vice,3,Fri Jul 10 00:43:48 2015 UTC,Well they sure as hell are probably spying on everyone's reactions to their mindfuckery!
Metalcore,3cqaqy,ktm57ktm57,3,Fri Jul 10 04:04:47 2015 UTC,I think you have confused Orwell with Vonnegut
Metalcore,3cqaqy,queensinthesky,4,Fri Jul 10 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"This is a lot of fun and all, but man... I'm not liking these lyrics. I really was hoping Oli would start to stretch himself more as a lyricist beyond the whole ""inner turmoil/ trapped in my head/ I'm drowning/ don't drown with me"" thing. Like, how much more can he possibly get from that creatively? It's also just frustrating because the whole genre overuses this whole concept so, so much. Hopefully the whole album will be a bit more varied."
Metalcore,3cqaqy,jesuslaves,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree, I think he focuses more on them sounding good and fitting in the context of the song , being catchy, easy to sing along to, etc... rather than being more poetic or whatever. As it appears he wrote these lyrics a year ago, and in this interview from December he mentions he still doesn't know what the subject matter is going to be, let's hope it'll be more varied."
Metalcore,3cqaqy,ConvolutedBoy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:46:01 2015 UTC,I love how he had to explain is simile there...
Metalcore,3crefy,Batman326,3,Fri Jul 10 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"See them, without a doubt.  They put on a show that rivals any band in metalcore right now in terms of stage presence and energy.  Seeing them is a must."
Metalcore,3crefy,UncommonSense0,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:27:46 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks! Since it's warped tour they can't go all out which sucks but i've seen other videos it's nuts
Metalcore,3crefy,UncommonSense0,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"When I saw them on Warped, they were on the Ernie Ball stage. The smallest stage, and yet they had as much stage presence as any band on main stage. It was incredible"
Metalcore,3covjt,luckynmbrsev,14,Thu Jul 9 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"Again, it certainly sounds like The Amity Affliction"
Metalcore,3covjt,I_Nut_In_Butts,7,Thu Jul 9 19:53:04 2015 UTC,They're really good. All their songs just sound... The same.
Metalcore,3covjt,FrostyJesus,6,Thu Jul 9 22:36:27 2015 UTC,To be fair to them it is just a B-side so I kinda expect it to sound similar. I hope they do something different for their next album though.
Metalcore,3covjt,bunnydeath_,4,Thu Jul 9 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"It's sad to say but if they don't adapt and spice up their sound, they may not make it too much farther."
Metalcore,3covjt,Vcom561,2,Fri Jul 10 00:21:33 2015 UTC,New?
Metalcore,3covjt,wakayoda,9,Thu Jul 9 17:24:58 2015 UTC,Yeah it was an unreleased B-side from Let The Ocean Take Me
Metalcore,3covjt,Runeon12,6,Thu Jul 9 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"To be clear:   Deluxe edition bonus tracks 11.     ""Skeletons"" 12.     ""Farewell"""
Metalcore,3covjt,KSOFM,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:42:24 2015 UTC,For some reason that outro really caught my attention. Love it when bands fade out well.
Metalcore,3covjt,bunnydeath_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:52:46 2015 UTC,And from their band facebook page today Skeletons. Going to go get 'Seems like Forever' straight after work!
Metalcore,3cq6hn,TheBousePrince,8,Thu Jul 9 21:59:03 2015 UTC,The sound quality is lacking but HOLY SHIT can Ryan kill it live!
Metalcore,3cq6hn,AllaboutthatDan,8,Fri Jul 10 00:37:41 2015 UTC,I've seen a lot of bands live and Ryan is undoubtedly my favorite. I still don't know how the fuck he does Warpath night after night after night.
Metalcore,3cq6hn,YesIAmAGinger,7,Fri Jul 10 02:47:51 2015 UTC,"I love these guys, they put on a great show. Ryan absolutely slays those vocals live.  But I really hate how they always wear their own merch when they play. Come on guys, you're supposed to rep other bands when you're on stage!"
Metalcore,3cq6hn,Jason_DeHoulo,2,Fri Jul 10 03:56:28 2015 UTC,What's the deal with that? It's either their own merch or windbreakers. Sometimes it's both.
Metalcore,3cq6hn,bigstupidjellyfish,2,Fri Jul 10 06:36:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of bands do that and it's a pet-peeve of mine, repping other bands or street cloths is cool, but it just seems tacky to where your own stuff.  And when front men where songlasess. Though I guess in this case the son may have been shining right in his eyes for all I know. But it still feels lame for some reason that that.   All that said, I do really love FFaK and then put on an incredible show."
Metalcore,3cq6hn,longhair_dude,2,Fri Jul 10 11:57:49 2015 UTC,I will never judge a band for wearing sunglasses on stage at warped.
Metalcore,3cq6hn,Hawkfan15,2,Fri Jul 10 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I meant to say, it's just when they do it in indoor venues that it annoys me."
Metalcore,3cq6hn,longhair_dude,4,Fri Jul 10 19:02:40 2015 UTC,Holy fuck. I'm willing to say he is the best screamer in metalcore right now.
Metalcore,3cq6hn,I_Nut_In_Butts,2,Fri Jul 10 04:09:12 2015 UTC,Fuck being sick. Fuck missing both Charlotte and VA beach Warped because of being sick.  I really wanted to see this live :(
Metalcore,3cq6hn,UncommonSense0,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:26:47 2015 UTC,Cannot wait to see them! Was so glad when they announced Hooked as a single right before Warped.
Metalcore,3cr6tr,AvengerAdam,3,Fri Jul 10 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"Channeling their 2003 Nu-metal I see. Personally, I'm having mixed feelings about it. I don't hate it, but it isn't my favorite."
Metalcore,3cr6tr,vcguitar,2,Fri Jul 10 03:05:16 2015 UTC,I was just going to say that haha.  Felt like I was listening to Papa Roach or POD or something.
Metalcore,3cr6tr,uberhaxorowen,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:44 2015 UTC,What is with this weird Nu metal revival? The chorus melody sounds like a Linkin Park chorus!
Metalcore,3cr6tr,HD_fight_club_Ryan,4,Fri Jul 10 03:25:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like WCAR is a band that has an identity crisis. It's like first they wanted to be metalcore, then post-hardcore, then easycore, and now nu-metal."
Metalcore,3cr6tr,HD_fight_club_Ryan,2,Fri Jul 10 16:48:20 2015 UTC,Easycore?
Metalcore,3cr6tr,HD_fight_club_Ryan,2,Fri Jul 10 16:48:59 2015 UTC,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easycore
Metalcore,3cr6tr,C3ntipede,2,Fri Jul 10 17:58:18 2015 UTC,"IMO some of the tracks on UWWGTB are so like soft and weird in parts its almost like they put a little easycore in it. It's not like full easycore.   Plus I got a friend who listen to only easycore/ pop-punk , but loves WCaR so maybe it's just something I unfairly associate with that."
