Legitpiercing,3duf64,tobiasx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:07:26 2015 UTC,What is the diameter of that ring?
Legitpiercing,3dsj85,stumblesmcgee,2,Sun Jul 19 01:11:31 2015 UTC,I'd say give your piercer a visit and they will probably be able to give you better direction on how to proceed :)
Legitpiercing,3dsj85,idontknowwhattosay-,2,Sun Jul 19 08:22:18 2015 UTC,Have a piercer stretch them for you. If you buy your jewelry from them they're usually pretty nice and waive the jewelry change fee. They'd be better able to tell you when it's good to stretch and when you have to wait. You can also try massaging your lobes with grapeseed oil. Helps the blood flow
Legitpiercing,3dsj85,amariaexathent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:32:54 2015 UTC,Yuppp you sound exactly like me. I just got pierced over the existing holes at 6g and stretched immediately to 4g. I'll have to wait for them to heal but there won't be any problems stretching in the future :)
Legitpiercing,3dph6n,thefujoshi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I heard tea tree oil is too harsh by itself without adding water, especially for sensitive skin. I add water to mine.  Would you still recommend your advice, even though the H2Ocean spray says to use it 3 or so times a day? And how people say to do sea salt cleaning twice a day?  I have oily skin and my ears don't have dry wax, so that's why I try to keep my piercings and ears really clean.   I'll tone down the cleaning to swiping my piercings with q-tips with sea salt and hot water twice a day?"
Legitpiercing,3dph6n,merveillesangel,3,Sat Jul 18 06:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I still stand by everything I've said.  There's no way that you would need to be using four different types of solutions on any piercing, whether it's new or old - it's overkill.  I've suggested leaving it alone and not putting anything on it because doing everything you're doing might be making the irritation worse - not better. Take a break from it and see if it improves. If not then bring ONE thing back, maybe the sea salt soaks or the chamomile soaks. I say once a day but twice a day can be okay too, you kind of need to listen to your body. I really can't stress that enough, just because something works for one person doesn't mean it'll work for someone else.  So I still recommend leaving it alone completely, no solutions, just clean it with water in the shower. Then if it gets worse, try the sea salt solution. The idea is that you let your body try healing it first before giving it some help.  For reference, this is one of the aftercare pages for the studio I go to (much of their advice matches advice I've seen strongly supported here): http://www.modifybodypiercing.com/irritated-piercings.html it might be worth a look."

Legitpiercing,3dph6n,bella26piano,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:26:07 2015 UTC,You could be allergic to the steel. Have you tried titanium?
Legitpiercing,3dph6n,bodmodman333,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:33:22 2015 UTC,What would it look like if I was allergic to my piercing? It's been over a year and there are no keloids or anything.
Legitpiercing,3dph6n,idontknowwhattosay-,2,Sat Jul 18 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"It would probably be irritated and uncomfortable, possibly painful to move the jewelry around. It might leak some lymph. The piercing hole might be reddish or swollen. These are all signs of allergy to the material. In your case, almost certainly something is irritating the piercing. So the source of irritation could still be something else, but if you don't have implant grade jewelry in it then that is probably what's irritating it. Do you have a piercer near you that stocks implant grade titanium? It's possible that simply switching your jewelry will fix the problem."
Legitpiercing,3dph6n,bg001x,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:33:55 2015 UTC,Stop using anything on it. Def stay away from chamomile and tea tree oil and stop doing soaks. Just get some good quality jewelry in them and it should be fine. Leave them alone as much as possible

Legitpiercing,3do2ym,bodmodman333,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:37 2015 UTC,You just need to go slow. And make sure you are following up with you piercer around the 2 week mark to shorten up the jewelry. That will make eating much easier. Did you get pierced with rings or labret studs?

Legitpiercing,3dklfn,bubblebitch168,3,Fri Jul 17 00:55:37 2015 UTC,You can get a niobium septum retainer (I think LeRoi makes them)  to start off with. It's very dark in color and it's practically invisible in your nose. It's meant to be hidden. Your piercer can flip it up for you and show you how to do it yourself.   I have a plain titanium retainer flipped up in my septum right now and no one has noticed it.
Legitpiercing,3dklfn,KidArtemis,2,Fri Jul 17 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"I wondered if I could just get a normal one ans be able to hide it, I should be going to the piercer tomorrow for my partners remaining little micro dermal project so may ask him then :)"
Legitpiercing,3dklfn,amariaexathent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:53:37 2015 UTC,You can get a normal one and let them know you'd like it flipped up. I have mine flipped up for work all the time

Legitpiercing,3dk3ix,bubblebitch168,6,Thu Jul 16 22:25:42 2015 UTC,I obviously cannot condone them as jewelry (especially on this subreddit) but if you used a padlock I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be able to pull that out.

My dad pulled out my taper when he saw it-minimal bleeding I had to take one out when my mum dyed my hair & another for Christmas when I was forced to put my hair up. Then I got to about 7/8mm and my mum saw the bottom of my ear was a bit chunky looking & thought it was infected-looked at it and again the taper was pulled out, but was given back to me"

Legitpiercing,3daahf,Kshaic,5,Tue Jul 14 18:49:31 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/Hc39PIt  Sorry for the weird lighting. I was trying to get light to come through my conch so you could see size.   My conch was punched at a 8g six years ago. I haven't worn anything in it for at least two years. I'm guessing I could at least comfortably wear a 10g. It hasn't closed up much at all.
Legitpiercing,3daahf,burntorangepeels,2,Tue Jul 14 20:48:47 2015 UTC,So I can well expect to keep that hole forever ?  I didn't think it was going to end up much different but thank you for your comment and especially the picture.
Legitpiercing,3daahf,burntorangepeels,3,Tue Jul 14 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it'll last forever. Some of that will depend on how long you keep jewelry in it (cartilage  takes a very long time to fully heal), and some of it will depend on how your body reacts to it. The cartilage itself won't grow back to be like it was before, but the skin could heal over it. I know someone that couldn't handle the discomfort of sleeping on healing punches, so they took them out and it's just a small hollowed out scar now. That said, make sure you really want it before you do it. It hurts for a long time and it's going to leave marks. Comfortable jewelry does exist (I loved my glass conch pins), but usually fairly costly. I just got tired of ear clutter and simplified. It looked great though."
Legitpiercing,3daahf,Susurro88,3,Tue Jul 14 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"Cartilage does not regenerate, so if you get a punch done (which removes a chunk of cartilage) then it will never fully close ever. The skin will grow around the exposed cartilage, but no new cartilage will grow and fill up the space."
Legitpiercing,3daahf,TheDoubtfulGuest,2,Wed Jul 15 14:48:36 2015 UTC,Thank you. I was aware that cartilage doesn't regenerate but I was wondering what the rate is at which the skin might fill in the hole and make it look like it's closed.
Legitpiercing,3daahf,bg001x,2,Wed Jul 15 14:53:55 2015 UTC,"I had my cartilage stretched to a 2g and, after losing the jewelry, it close up to a 6g in 8 months. It wasn't gonna get any smaller, so I'd say punching it would mean minimal closing. Maybe one gauge size if that."

Legitpiercing,3cea68,veracosa,2,Tue Jul 7 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"When I first had mine I had this same problem, I never found an easy solution but I had success a few times by holding the ball with tweezers, holding the ring still with the other hand and getting the ball started, then screwing it in by hand. If you manage to do it you have to turn the tweezers/ball as far as possible without letting go so that the ball is screwed on enough not to fall off."

Legitpiercing,3c6wk5,SenoraDroolcup,2,Sun Jul 5 12:36:11 2015 UTC,So I had some sensitivity for a week or so after getting my septum.  Although my aftercare regimine was different.  It was essentially litha except to do a quick rinse with sss solution twice a day for 30 seconds.  I think you may be irritating the piercing by cleaning off the crusties.  Try eliminating that and only fo some sss.
Legitpiercing,3c6wk5,jbrown5217,2,Sun Jul 5 14:44:58 2015 UTC,I wonder if maybe the crusties are poking you? That's the only time mine is even remotely painful.
Legitpiercing,3c6wk5,SulkingUnicorn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:56:11 2015 UTC,"At about a week this is pretty normal. You'll have soreness as you move your nose for the first few weeks at least. It's definitely possible that you may have a bit of a reaction depending on the sensitivity of your skin, but in the given situation I don't think it's necessarily that. I might suggest flipping it up for a bit for a while. I tend to have clients flip it up more often then not for the first few weeks so it doesn't get bumped or accidentally knocked out. If anything stop in and see your piercer, or if you need a second opinion we can find another piercer that we can suggest.  Photos would help as far as determining if it is placed well."

I don't think I remember my septum to actually swell much compared to other piercings but it's been something like 10 years ago so I might just remember all wrong.
Legitpiercing,3a3a5j,CrazyMarmoset,3,Wed Jun 17 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"When I got mine pierced he placed it nice and high, even after increasing the diameter of the ring mine sits nice and snug. Its defiantly possible. This is a pic from last week when he changed the ends to some sweet claw set turquoise to match my conch.  Pic  Edit: He had just pierced my tongue so I have shiny lips haha, once again an unplanned piercing but I like it."
Legitpiercing,3a3a5j,tobiasx,3,Thu Jun 18 04:57:42 2015 UTC,Now that's a good looking septum piercing!

Legitpiercing,3a3a5j,HarveyOpossum,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:43:44 2015 UTC,"You would have to ask a piercer to be certain. They could show you different options and sizes.  Mine didn't swell much either, was just a bit sore really. A week into having mine done I got a really runny nose and my retainer wouldn't stay in so I stuck a 10mm diameter ring in for a couple weeks (I don't recommend this, but it was put the ring in or let the piercing close). It was decently snug on my nose and it didn't impact the healing or anything."
Legitpiercing,3a3a5j,anitnevoc,2,Wed Jun 17 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"My initial piercing was done with a retainer, and I was told I could swap it out for a clicker after about two months. I'm not sure, but I would guess a clicker might not be the best for an initial piercing because the hinges could collect a lot of crusties."
Legitpiercing,3a3a5j,anitnevoc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:12:00 2015 UTC,I think that might be my best option. I usually heal super fast but weirdly the last piercings I had was my nipples 1 1/2 year ago and they can't seem to heal properly.
Legitpiercing,3a3a5j,anitnevoc,2,Wed Jun 17 17:22:52 2015 UTC,I just got my nipples done two weeks ago. What's the healing process been like for you?
Legitpiercing,39yu9j,Hipashia,2,Mon Jun 15 22:12:15 2015 UTC,That clicker is goregous. Looking  forward to seeing it in.
Legitpiercing,39nf2j,FOXTAN,13,Sat Jun 13 00:07:23 2015 UTC,"If they are truly legit, they care about their work, and will help you out. Also, sometimes peoples coworkers are idiots. When the piercer is back in town, give them a visit.!"
Legitpiercing,39nf2j,veracosa,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:39:17 2015 UTC,I made an appointment for a check up with the piercer on Tuesday.  I'll update then!
Legitpiercing,39nf2j,Susurro88,8,Mon Jun 15 02:03:45 2015 UTC,I would just go back in and talk to the person who actually pierced you. They may even be able to resterilize your jewelry that you have in now and reuse it to repierce you. Septums are notorious for ending up crooked even when done by the best of the best.
Legitpiercing,39nf2j,showmebevelle,2,Sat Jun 13 05:24:31 2015 UTC,UPDATE: I went to the piercer and he was super nice and understanding. He said I could either wait for another couple of weeks and he would check it again since it was still a bit swollen or I could take it out and we could redo it in 2 weeks. I decided to just go ahead and get it redone. Not looking forward to getting it repierced (it was my most painful piercing) but I miss it already haha.
Legitpiercing,39nf2j,gtfokenny,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:01:33 2015 UTC,And that's the joy of visiting a legit piercer!
Legitpiercing,39lycj,norasquirrel,3,Fri Jun 12 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"Obviously you don't want to wear potentially low quality jewelry for any extended period of time, so why not go get them checked out by the APP member you mentioned and get their opinion? Doing so can't hurt anything and they'll be able to help you out a lot more than random people on the internet. My suggestion would be to call ahead of time and make sure the piercer is in and has time to help you out though."
Legitpiercing,39lycj,mrkrnj,2,Sat Jun 13 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, going in is probably the best option. Good suggestion about calling ahead of time. Thanks so much!"
Legitpiercing,39lycj,modgirl13,3,Sat Jun 13 01:07:02 2015 UTC,Definitely get higher quality jewelry! It's probably best to go see the APP member and have them change the jewelry for me. My piercings stopped getting angry at me when I switched to high quality titanium. It's worth it.
Legitpiercing,39lycj,modgirl13,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:48:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I plan on going in early this week when he's back from the conference. I just don't want to irritate the fistula too much from switching jewelry, but I can understand that having lower quality jewelry in would make it worse, and higher quality can make it heal better. Thanks again!"
Legitpiercing,39c8e8,soyunamariposa,3,Wed Jun 10 20:03:18 2015 UTC,"Unless you have the money to spare, you may want to wait on ordering the hoop - you'll have to wait at least ~6 months anyway for the piercing to heal before you can wear it. Once you do though I'd suggest the smaller of the two =)"
Legitpiercing,39c8e8,staciarain,2,Wed Jun 10 22:22:44 2015 UTC,"Ah well, the order would take about 8 weeks to arrive anyway so maybe I'll line those two things up!  But why the smaller?  Is it just personal preference?  I'm actually worrying about it being too small/hidden so that it can't be seen well."
Legitpiercing,39c8e8,staciarain,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:37:54 2015 UTC,"I can't find any good pictures that mention the size, but - depending on the angle and the positioning - it seems like something slightly smaller would be better for a rook, compared to what you typically see in daith piercings."
Legitpiercing,39c8e8,staciarain,2,Thu Jun 11 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, I get this.  So by definition then if I choose a rook piercing, the intent is to be tucked back in my ear anyway, versus a more obvious daith.  That makes sense."
Legitpiercing,39c8e8,HarveyOpossum,2,Thu Jun 11 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly - I finally found an image, too: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/64/d0/f4/64d0f4cf2343e716fe958e3c31b9c71b.jpg  It just doesn't seem like there's as much room for the hoop to hang or lay flat, so the bigger it is the more likely it is to stick out, I imagine."
Legitpiercing,39c8e8,showmebevelle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"Ah that's perfect, thank you!"
Legitpiercing,39c8e8,showmebevelle,3,Thu Jun 11 17:56:37 2015 UTC,Can you post a picture of your ear? Seeing what it looks like with its current jewelry would help you get better opinions.
Legitpiercing,3928zd,thatsnotgneiss,3,Mon Jun 8 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"I use a travel pillow so I can sleep on my side. I've got rooks in both ears, and a helix in one. The travel pillow is comfortable and an excellent solution for being able to rock ear cartilage piercings AND sleep comfortably!"
Legitpiercing,3928zd,secretagentkitty,2,Tue Jun 9 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"The best advice I have for healing an industrial would be to baby it, make sure you get quality jewelry, and invest in a good travel pillow so you can sleep on your side without laying on your ear."
Legitpiercing,3928zd,bodmodman333,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"I wonder if a CPAP pillow would work. It has cutouts on the side, and that might work for my ear"
Legitpiercing,3928zd,bodmodman333,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:28:33 2015 UTC,Hmm. Never seen one. As long as it allows your ear to not have pressure on it it should be fine.
Legitpiercing,3928zd,bodmodman333,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:49:40 2015 UTC,It looks something like this
Legitpiercing,3928zd,veracosa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:18:31 2015 UTC,"That would work, but I dont know how comfortable it would be. haha. Try it, you can always get something else if it doesn't work well."
Legitpiercing,3928zd,lurkielurker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"I have one. I got it when I got my CPAP, and it didn't really do much since I have a very small mask. But it might work just right for my ear."
Legitpiercing,38zyka,applauds,11,Mon Jun 8 06:21:35 2015 UTC,"I've never had a blown out, but you should take them out. This is not a good way to start your stretching journey. Keep doing soaks and take them out for now. I would put the 16g back in once your ear is no longer tender (at least wait a few weeks).  Oh, and never, EVER go back to that parlor. Ever. No good piercer would do this."
Legitpiercing,38zyka,eeenrose,5,Mon Jun 8 11:07:35 2015 UTC,"Never ever go to that place again. And yes, take them out and let your ears chill. Leave them alone as much as possible and keep them clean. There is an ear stretching guide on my website, www.everythingj.com I recommend checking it out. Basically its going to say let your ears stretch naturally and only use quality glass or titanium jewelry for stretching."
Legitpiercing,38zyka,bodmodman333,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"Take them out, leave a very honest review of that place online, and NEVER trust them with another body mod again.  Get some non-iodized sea salt and 1 gallon of distilled water.  Put in 4tsp of salt, and shake the gallon well before each use.  Pour a small amount into a microwave safe dish or heat on the stovetop.  You want it just barely above room temperature, a little warm but nowhere near hot.  Soak your ears for 10 minutes each, twice daily.  I would leave my ears naked if I were you, at least for a couple of days.  If irritation goes down significantly, going back to a 16g with implant grade steel or glass during healing should be fine.  Do not use soap, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or anything else on them.  If they feel really dry, cut the soak times in half or switch to once a day.  When your ears are fully healed, start research into stretching again, and come here to ask any questions you need answered.  If your ears get infected, or you think they're infected, see your doctor ASAP.  I would recommend visiting safepiercing.org to find a quality shop near you."
Legitpiercing,38zyka,BakerELMT,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:25:23 2015 UTC,"I am so destroyed by this, I really wanted to start.  I am contemplating taking them out, and starting all over again...  But at the moment, they are not bleeding, hurting, or anything of the sort. They're quite comfortable, and aren't even oozing. No blowouts or anything either....  would you still suggest I take them out?"
Legitpiercing,38zyka,BakerELMT,2,Tue Jun 9 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely.  At the very least you should downsize.  I'm at a 00 after over a year of stretching, and I want so badly to hit my first goal of 3/4"" so I understand your impatience.  It is better to do things right the first time, that way you don't have a blowout later on, or have to deal with thinning earlobes."
Legitpiercing,38uzgq,Rising_Star1et,10,Sun Jun 7 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would wait. I got mine done as a sort of 'reward' for reaching my goal weight, as I never would have been able to pull off a navel piercing when I was heavier.   If you wait until you are done losing weight, your piercer knows what your stomach will look like to put the piercing in the right spot and the right angle. Your stomach changes so much when losing weight, it's pretty much impossible to know how it will look when you're done.   And it feels really really damn good to have such a physical reward for reaching your goal :)"

AJ was professional, courteous, and comforting. I knew it'd go well when he started singing along to Billy Joel while walking me around the studio. I would certainly recommend him to anyone looking for a quality piercer in the area!"
Legitpiercing,38gcby,TheHeroineOfTime08,2,Thu Jun 4 00:56:53 2015 UTC,"Day 1 was pretty sore. I could definitely feel the skin/jewelery move when I put my arms above my head, made certain faces, or stretched too far. OTC Ibuprofen worked wonders to ameliorate that. The best way to describe it is like two deep bruises/pulled muscles. I knew when I was using those muscles because it'd be achy.  Day 2 (this morning) I'm only the slightest bit sore. Barely noticeable if I weren't paying attention. I took another dose of ibuprofen to keep swelling down, but I would have been perfectly fine without it. Range of motion fully restored.  My aftercare technique so far has involved:   OTC ibuprofen when needed 15 minutes cold pack 2 times a day (morning and right before bed) Saline soaked gauze 3 times a day (every 8 hours or so) Lots of rest and staying hydrated"
Legitpiercing,3869ur,OmenOfCuddles,8,Tue Jun 2 03:47:32 2015 UTC,Talk to your piercer. He/she would know the best fit and style for your anatomy. They also have access to wholesale jewelers that don't sell directly to consumers.   I'm sure they'll hook you up with something fancy to wear. :)
Legitpiercing,3869ur,pfftiful,0,Tue Jun 2 09:42:07 2015 UTC,"to bounce off of this, before i make my own post. anyone know where to but bells for nipple piercings? all i'm finding is Christmas bells, and allthough thats cute, just not something i'm interested in."
