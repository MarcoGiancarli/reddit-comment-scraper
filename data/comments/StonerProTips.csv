StonerProTips,3deabn,mindset_7,16,Wed Jul 15 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"IMPORTANT PSA If you're making this because you're under 18 (or if you just don't have enough money for a real vape, and you live with your parents) don't make this. Or at least be way more discreet about hiding it than you normally are with things like this.  Because even if your parents are okay with bud, there's a 95% chance they'll think this is a DIY crack or meth pipe. Even if they believe you when you say it's for vaping weed, it still plants a seed of doubt and can taint their view of your weed use."

StonerProTips,3deabn,slappytheclown,2,Thu Jul 16 02:40:19 2015 UTC,How does this even vape lol. Also so much plastic.
StonerProTips,3deabn,Otaku_swag94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"The idea is you place the bud in the bulb and then heat the bulb with a lighter or candle or some heat source. The glass spreads the heat out and prevents the bud from combusting. It will heat up enough to cause the vapor that you want. Vape through the straw and empty the weed when you are done.   However; there are better methods now and a vape pipe can cost as little as $30. This name brand one is a lttile more but your local head shop should have some cheaper ones.   http://www.lighterusa.com/vaporgenie-classic-oak.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=CjwKEAjwiZitBRCy0pb3rIbG9XwSJACmuvvz86oMTAzKqwxbiQ8nUi_Nh5gv8u3Wfma1dAqQ_6t6PhoCLnDw_wcB  If you can't buy a vape for whatever reason, there are better things to use than a light bulb. Small bud vases (like this one http://www.amazon.com/Libbey-7-1-2-Inch-Cylinder-Vase/dp/B001MX2HO6 ) are an easier and more sturdy way to rig up a vape."

StonerProTips,3cchyd,Caldehyde,7,Tue Jul 7 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"Well, considering it gives everything a menthol/mint/lemon flavor which makes your lungs feel refreshed and like your breathing the most pure mountain air, I'd say it works in some fashion. Better than putting a bunch of lemon juice in your bong than just 2 drops of this extract"

Which this one is not even available with nicotine.. It's like potpourris for your bong water that's all. It actually imparts a eucalyptus flavor and aroma on your hits, that's it. It just feels refreshing. I'm in no way trying to get everyone to do this every bong pack. Hell, I haven't even tried it again since I posted this. All I can say is that I've heard a lot of people putting a lot of weird shit in their bong water, looking for something different, but nothing compares to putting only one or two drops of this in your bong, I really can't describe how your lungs feel. Like you just got your lungs cleaned at the dentist or something."
StonerProTips,3cchyd,SavageDark,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:19:26 2015 UTC,"sounds terrible. ecig juice is terrible. its often filled with nicotine and can even contain heavy metals. never use anything for bong water other than water. if you want to act fancy, use voss instead."

StonerProTips,3chw37,c-biscuit77,6,Wed Jul 8 03:33:20 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Get through high school first. I knew a lot of kids who started smoking around 13-14 and they wound up a lot dimmer than the kids who started at 18+. Not to mention higher grades in high school = cheaper college (through scholarships etc.) if you're interested in going.

Youth should be about fun, learning and experience. Go out and do stuff, don't hide in your room and smoke weed. Wait till you're 21. Maybe your dad will offer to smoke you up before then.   If you know that your dad smokes weed, then he's probably pretty open about it.  Ask him about it, or start up a conversation on the subject and see what he has to say about cannabis use. If he's like me he will tell you that smoking a j at night helps relax him after a tough day and that it's best to wait until you are older. Good luck young'n."

I'd say wait until minimum 15-16.    Maybe, if you're really curious you can bring it up to your dad, but it should be in more of a ""I'm curious about this and looking for more information"" way, and not in a ""yo, can you hook me up, bro"" way.  If you ""plant the seeds"" so to speak with him and earn trust then by the time you're closer to that age the conversation turns from information to how to do it safely, at which time hopefully he ""leaves some somewhere accidentally"".  12/13 is too young.  You have your whole life to use it, just wait until the right time."

StonerProTips,3chw37,BarkerBear,3,Wed Jul 8 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"But to answer your question: Definitely ask your Dad if you have the option. Far better idea than finding a random dealer. Just yeah, wait til you're a bit older"
StonerProTips,3chw37,BarkerBear,3,Wed Jul 8 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"way too young, it can mess with your thought processes, concentration, and motivation when you start with a brain still developing as much as yours. Also just a heads up, not all weed is kush, kush comes from a valley in Afghanistan, using kush as a blanket term for all weed makes one sound like a 420blazeit jackass"

StonerProTips,3chw37,swill5000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"Why not?  Responsible parents should take a firm stance on drug use, but that stand shouldn't be ""Don't do as I do"" without offering guidance for when they are adults and can make those decisions.  My Mom said my ass was grass if I did any drinking, smoking, or drugs unless she both provided and supervised.  I had no interest for a long time - they suggested I try half a glass of wine at Thanksgiving when I was 13, and after that I was allowed one glass at holiday dinners.   Why?  First, to learn what a buzz felt like.  That way if I ever drank a non-virgin cocktail without realizing, I'd know what I was drinking.  Second, to show that they were serious about the implied offer to consider allowing me to do any experimenting with their supervision.  And lastly, to take some of the ""lure of the forbidden"" away.  Kids want what they can't have, especially if the reason seems arbitrary.     And to teens, age often feels arbitrary.  I did drink a very few times outside of those restrictions, but those were not routine.  And when I was about to leave for college, they talked and Dad got some good stuff and said he wanted to smoke me out once before I left.  He said the reason was not wanting me to experiment out there for the first time around strangers, and wanted me to know what high quality stuff looked, smelled, and tasted like so if I did try it I wouldn't overpay.  I am not saying that the good parent should always say yes to such requests.  But they shouldn't renege on their responsibility to both protect their children, and teach them about the real world.  With recreational use becoming legal in many jurisdictions, more kids may be curious.  Even just saying ""I will when you turn 1#"" is a better response to such a request than a lecture, or worse, making the kid go to questionable others to do what they may very well do with or without parental consent."

StonerProTips,3chw37,Alarm420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:26:10 2015 UTC,"The answer to this question is heavily age-dependent.  You say you're going to be in high school in a year, so if you're in North America, that puts you at 12-13. So, definitely no, like other posters, I wouldn't recommend trying pot until you're well into high school.   Source: 27 year old daily smoker that started smoking around age 16-17 while living with my dad who smokes more than I do. I hid my smoking from my parents when I lived there (I got caught by mom a few times, she was not pleased but would just give my pot to my dad, so at least it didn't get wasted). Now that I'm an adult, my dad gives me between a gram and a quarter, depending on his supply, when I go to the parents to visit.   TL;DR- you're too young to be smoking pot, let alone asking dad for some to try. Don't rock the boat, if you must, dabble in it in your later teens, re-evaluate after college/living on your own."

I wouldn't ask my dad if he smoked and I wasnt even a Jr, that's something I believe you should try to not get your urges in stupid places but that's if he would let  you, I've let my sister hit a bowl after I asked if she wanted to take a hit once she knew I was going to the backyard to toke and she was 14, but me and my sister are really close, she's known I've smoked since forever I was 20 when I let her, she now knows what kind of high something like Girl Scout Cookies gives you, she told me she didn't like but she gets why people do like it she's very smart, I am very proud of her for alot of her life decisions, so now I know that if she's out at a party or hanging out, she won't have the curiosity.   I like to think I did the right thing as a Marijuana Enthusiast with a sibling who knows marijuana is a culter being adopted now a days and its safer than a Starbucks coffee and the other amazing shit it can do, but that's just me, and she knows I do it recreationally and to relax after working my ass of now a days."

I worry about any permanent effects it could have on a developing mind, and don't want you to risk anything just for fun. A medical reason, certainly, but you can wait to get high.   If you do decide to smoke, don't make a habit of it. Try it once for the experience with your dad, then leave it be until late high school."

StonerProTips,3b1xuj,InternationalToker,3,Thu Jun 25 09:57:31 2015 UTC,"mucinex will help clear anything out of your lungs, making your coughs productive and hopefully helping with the root of the cough, but it won't actually clear your cough up.   cough drops will definitely help with the soreness of throat and throat tickles that cause unnecessary coughing. cold meds may be beneficial if, a day or two after you stop smoking, your cough persists. if OTC stuff doesn't help resolve the issues within a week, or it gets worse, see a doctor right away. (don't look online bc i know from experience it'll make you think you have TB lmao).  and like u/InternationToker said, try looking into vaping, or other forms of ingestion besides smoking in the future! it could very well be that really your lungs just aren't happy with all that nastiness, like how long time cig-smokers never get rid of smokers cough.   good luck op!"

Mucinex helps a ton, but after a few days it may cause you to vomit unexpectedly. I was using mucinex last month when I had allergies and five days into taking a pill a day I got sick randomly while staying with a friend. I felt fine before and after, went to work the next day and everything, I just had no idea that could be a side effect, so I was caught very much off guard. After that though, mucous was a thing of the past."

StonerProTips,3a4i4i,cutlerf,2,Wed Jun 17 19:09:36 2015 UTC,SPT: Don't use salt. It also can scape the glass over time.   As for getting rid of this salt you need to use hot water (not boiling) and shake the fuck out of it.
StonerProTips,3a4i4i,averyminya,2,Wed Jun 17 07:15:49 2015 UTC,"What do you recommend? I have heard that salt can scratch glass, but I find that nothing works as well. 99% (or 91%) with a gram or two of salt (depending on grit and size of piece) make it seem cleaner than when I bought it online. I simply can't find an alternative."
StonerProTips,3a4i4i,cutlerf,2,Wed Jun 17 08:30:47 2015 UTC,"I like Grunge Off. Not only does it destroy resin and make your glass clean, but it is also reusable. A $14 bottle can last you a lot longer than $14 of iso or other cleaners."
StonerProTips,3a4i4i,doggxyo,2,Wed Jun 17 09:13:54 2015 UTC,What's the process of using this? I understand letting it soak in the solution but how do you reuse it? Poar it back into the bottle after you've used it?
StonerProTips,3a4i4i,cutlerf,2,Wed Jun 17 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"So I've used them all. Grunge off, 420 cleaner, Randy's black label, and then your regular isopropyl salt mixture.  Grunge off was neat, you can pour it into your piece and shake it about - and then pour the solution back into the bottle. After a few cleanings, the solution is mixed with your old resin and starts to get kinda nasty. I do not like to use reusable cleaners anymore as I think they get really gross with resin. 420 cleaner works decently well, but it just reminded me of my own iso salt mixes.   I really liked Randy's black label glass cleaner. This shit really cleaned out all of the resin in my pieces and brought it back to day 0 with just a few shakes of the piece with the solution inside.  On the other hand, the iso (99%) and salt is the cheapest and works just as well as any of these cleaners."

StonerProTips,3a4i4i,averyminya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:53:03 2015 UTC,The directions are to simply let it soak. 12-24 hours will nuke even the dirtiest piece. I have gotten away with simply shaking it in my pieces without percs for a couple minutes. To reuse it I pour it back into the bottle with a funnel and a coffee filter.

I've tried it a couple different times, doing it different each time. I tried for 2 hours, 6 hours, and a whole day - each of them getting shaken every now and still nothing. The friend who let me borrow it said the only reason he thinks it didn't work for me is because grunge off works better for tobacco resin?

StonerProTips,3a4i4i,PunkAintDead,3,Wed Jun 17 04:37:49 2015 UTC,"The only issue with the boiling water I see is that it will weaken the glass. Although it may not be harmful for one time use, OP be wary of using boiling water in your pipes constantly. Especially because your glass may crack from sudden temperature changes. I used to have a bubbler that I would put near-boiling water in  for every sesh, and soon enough the glass became so weak that it snapped cleanly off right where the water level could usually be found."

StonerProTips,39zxt4,Jellephant,7,Tue Jun 16 04:38:48 2015 UTC,"If you're able to get a water pipe or rig a third lung the temperature of the smoke drops a lot and becomes much easier to inhale. If you're stuck with joints, take slower draws, hold it in your mouth a bit before inhaling deeper, and have something cold to drink between drags."

StonerProTips,39pc4r,Jabadaba,2,Sat Jun 13 15:59:06 2015 UTC,I heard raw cancelled their 300 packs. After this box of papers my plan was to switch to smoking brand. It just doesn't match my rolling accessories. Do they make trays at all?
StonerProTips,39pc4r,sydarious,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"Hi there, what exactly do you mean with a tray? I either buy a single pack of 33 leaves, for $1, or I go to the wholesaler/importer and buy a box of 50 packs of 33 leaves for $40. Perhaps you mean a roll of paper so you can measure your own desired length? If so the answer is yes they do make rolls of paper. Good luck"
StonerProTips,39pc4r,Jabadaba,8,Tue Jun 16 19:14:16 2015 UTC,One of the best things about RAWs is the grid pattern in place of the usual stripes. Makes for a great burn. Imo they also taste better.  If you have trouble getting them to stick try to import them from Europe. I only heard Americans complain about that and personally had an exclusively good experience over the course of some years.
StonerProTips,39pc4r,Bossmensch,7,Sat Jun 13 16:04:48 2015 UTC,I use Element papers. Tried Raw just not my bag man. If you are having problems with the glue sticking try licking the backside of the paper where the glue is. Your saliva will soak through but won't lick off the glue
StonerProTips,39pc4r,kobimus,10,Sat Jun 13 16:47:44 2015 UTC,I like my zig zags personally
StonerProTips,39pc4r,moxie132,4,Sat Jun 13 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"I'm prepared for the hate, but any rolling paper is only going to be marginally ""better for you"" than any other paper.  Sure some may be more processed than others but the bottom line is papers/wraps are some organic material other than cannabis that you are burning and inhaling.   Smoke of any kind, including marijuana, is not necessarily ""safe to inhale"". It is true that cannabis smoke has been shown to have less evidence of damage to lung tissue than other organics, but it's still smoke.   That being said, I'm not trying to lecture. What I'm getting at is roll and smoke what you want, whatever you can roll best, or whatever burns the best TO YOU. Try a bunch of different papers and see which ones work for you best.  TL;DR: There is no definitive evidence to say any rolling paper is necessarily better for you than another.  The healthiest way to consume cannabis is digestion or vaporization.  The healthiest way to SMOKE cannabis will be a waterpipe."
StonerProTips,39pc4r,deltablazing,4,Sat Jun 13 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"Some people think the RAW papers don't stick well, if you do it right they stick just as well as any other paper, and imo the smoke is much better."
StonerProTips,39pc4r,fappitydappity,3,Sat Jun 13 16:20:42 2015 UTC,"The brown raws can be hard to stick, but the white (organic) raws work well imo. I've only used those and elements, and both only in a rolling machine. Both seem to roll and burn fine. Maybe the raws taste a bit better and are a bit thicker and easier to roll... But it's been a while since I've used either and my recollection could be wrong. Either way, I did like the raws a lot and would buy more."
StonerProTips,39pc4r,bossrabbit,3,Sat Jun 13 13:36:07 2015 UTC,"I used to only get raws, but switched to elements. The papers are thinner and I find it to have a less ashy taste."
StonerProTips,39pc4r,chinestoner,2,Sun Jun 14 01:24:52 2015 UTC,Late to the party but I like elements the best in my opinion. Raw is pretty similar to element in that you can't slobber on the glue just use as little saliva as possible and they will stick fine.
StonerProTips,39pc4r,WillyBongka,2,Sat Jun 13 21:01:59 2015 UTC,I like Raw papers pretty well. Never had issues
StonerProTips,39pc4r,JBOSS_08,4,Sun Jun 14 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think organic is just a selling point. Natural materials are definitely better than artifical materials, but they don't necessarily need to be organic. That being said, organic papers are going to be made of natural materials guaranteed. I like raw,  personally. They're smooth."
StonerProTips,39pc4r,Angus_Fraser,4,Sat Jun 13 15:48:53 2015 UTC,"No. The word ""organic"" doesn't mean ""healthier"" or ""higher quality"" or even ""pesticide free"". I'm not even sure that it has a legal definition when used to describe a rolling paper (i.e. Not a food item.)"

One time I was heading back to the parking lot of a river hiking area and met up with these hippies in an old conversion school bus. This guy pulls out a HUGE parabolic magnifying glass (salvaged from an old movie projector maybe?) and we proceed to toke solar bowls, the concentrated light was so intense it created instant smoke and could easily torch the whole bowl if you weren't careful.   There's something special about using concentrated radiation that traveled 94 million miles from a giant ball of plasma to light your bowl."

Sure you'll waste some paper but this is a great way to find a method that suits you.  The way I do it is I put the filter om the left side of the paper (I'm right handed). Once filled, I pinch the paper above the filter with my left thumb and index finger horizontally while simultaneously pinching just above the weed with my right thumb and index finger coming in vertically (from under the joint) just and the end of the filter. Then I roll the contents up and down, similar to the dollar method someone mentioned, minus the dollar. While I'm doing this I move my right thumb and index finger side to side to make sure all the weed gets evenly packed. Once done, i go over the same procedure again, only this time my right thumb and index finger are horizontally aligned so that I can roll all the neetly packed contents to the point where the edge of the paper is at height with your fingers. If done right, it'll be reasy to roll the joint really nice and packed in just one motion.  Bit wierd to explain without illustration, but hopefully you can visualize this."

StonerProTips,37qlvg,Nappy2fly,1 point,Fri May 29 22:48:07 2015 UTC,hopefully this can translate to words. so you want to slide(or roll) the paper  up and down with your thumbs and pointers until its packed in about the shape you want the joint. once its at the right-ish shape you will go back up and down but on the last one ur gonna slide it all the way til the bud is sticking out a little then use your pointers wrap it over then just keep on rolling then lick it and ur good!
StonerProTips,37qlvg,jaymarksman,1 point,Fri May 29 17:06:28 2015 UTC,Try making your thumbs more horizontal when you begin to tuck the paper
StonerProTips,37qlvg,JCPOTS12,1 point,Fri May 29 23:38:30 2015 UTC,"Sounds crazy but i think its easier to roll woth no filter at all. Ive been rolling exclusively joints for my life as a smoker and using a filter means one hand is preoccupied holding it the whole time. Try by putting in bud to paper, rolling a nice circular log, take ur time to make sure its firm. The log is everything, the middle should be the firmest part. Start by using both hands to tuck the middle nicely then make the sides conform to the tuck with your fingers by rolling up slowly and making sure the paper is in place. Once its tucked you can roll it up more and adjust the j for tightness."

StonerProTips,37qlvg,Jsr1,1 point,Sat May 30 11:05:05 2015 UTC,"This is an easy yet not pretty way I usually use when I'm out and just want to get it done quickly:   Roll it until the weed and tip have the right form, nothing messy sticking up or something. Only thing missing is the wrapped paper otherwise it should be ready. Entirely roll down at the tip side. It is easier if the pape is angled because that prevents stuff from falling out at the front. Pinch hard at the tip with one hand and right in front of it with the other. Roll up slightly and the pape should get hooked on the tip. Roll further on the tip side while slowly sliding up the joint with the other hand to get it hooked evenly. Only roll at the tip, the other (in my case left) hand just enables the tucking.   With this method the wrap won't be perfectly tight and at the very front the paper might fold over instead of getting tucked but you can still close it and smoke it perfectly fine. About 70% should be tucked right.  Most important thing is obviously practice. Get a pack of rolling tobacco and roll a couple of cigarettes. I'd bet that it won't take more than 30 mins to figure out a good way for yourself."

StonerProTips,37qlvg,lovenotwar1234,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"I naturally have shaky hands so it's hard for me to roll the usual way. To fix this, I use a filter (cut out a small strip of a index card, like 3/4cm wide, then fold it back and forth like an accordion 5 or 6 times, then roll the rest of the paper around the accordion part to make it circular) and roll an empty joint using the filter to make the shape. Then I put a few pinches of tree in the open end of the j, and use a pen or stick or similar object to pack it down. Repeat this step for the whole length of the j and then twist the end shut. I find this makes prettier and denser joints than the normal method even though it takes more time."

StonerProTips,36wkyg,doggxyo,2,Fri May 22 22:30:47 2015 UTC,these things were one hit wonders but damn did they destroy your throat.
StonerProTips,36sqsy,define_irony,12,Thu May 21 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"ahahaha the 151 is an exponentially more inhospitable environment for impurities than water, I think it'll take care of any and the bud can go in without being waterlogged"
StonerProTips,36sqsy,rowingforlife,2,Thu May 21 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"I dont think he's necessarily concerned with the environment of Bacardi 151. washing the impurities out of bud neutralizes the taste so that your consumables don't have that bitter flavor. I get what you are saying though and I agree with your sentiment, its a lot of work to water cure avb and I can imagine if someone is drinking 151 they shouldn't be too concerned about taste."
StonerProTips,36sqsy,rusty_wheels,3,Fri May 22 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. Look up water curing. It's a great idea to do with green dragon anyways as it minimizes the chlorophyll that gets in to the alcohol (tastes horrible). You'll have to dry it afterwards, to make sure the alcohol can penetrate."
StonerProTips,36sqsy,thepainteddoor,2,Fri May 22 14:49:27 2015 UTC,what impurities?
StonerProTips,36sqsy,WaveToYourWebcam,2,Thu May 21 22:06:04 2015 UTC,"Ive never heard of such a thing,  but it would make sense as ash will dissolve fairly well out of the abv while most of the goodies stay. Its still a pretty roundabout way of consuming abv though, considering you could just fill gelatin capsules with the matter and swallow those."
StonerProTips,36sqsy,Notdrugs,0,Fri May 22 03:32:39 2015 UTC,Question. What are you trying to accomplish by letting it sit in water?
StonerProTips,36sqsy,lolItsZana,2,Thu May 21 22:06:13 2015 UTC,"Go check out /r/avb. A lot of the frequent posters on that sub and frequent users of avb like to ""water cure"" their avb. Basically the idea is that it will remove some of the nasty taste (it can be pretty bad)."
StonerProTips,36sqsy,Martient712,1 point,Fri May 22 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm, never heard of that. Honestly, seems a little too convoluted for me."
StonerProTips,36sqsy,lolItsZana,2,Fri May 22 00:37:10 2015 UTC,Yeah too much effort for me
StonerProTips,36sqsy,Martient712,0,Fri May 22 00:48:41 2015 UTC,Yeah is seems like a waste of time. Probably just expands the bits of AVB a little while full of water so when you dry them they are larger so burn easier?  Even that sounds like BS.
StonerProTips,36sqsy,q1a2z3x4s5w6,2,Fri May 22 14:53:44 2015 UTC,"Well... No. It washes away the shit that is water soluble ie dirt and stuff that happens while growing while keeping the THC because THC (or in the case of avb, thc-a (I think, I'm on mobile)) is not water soluble. The stuff that gives your edibles that bitter taste is the stuff that's washed away in a water cure."
