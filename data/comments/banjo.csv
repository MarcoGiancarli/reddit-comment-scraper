banjo,3dzt2c,MyLittleFedora,2,Mon Jul 20 21:26:06 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome. This was one of the first songs I ever learned to play on the banjo and still play it a ton.  really like your accent notes in the.. B part I guess?
banjo,3e0nka,paulishuku,5,Tue Jul 21 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"I'll expand a little on what /u/haroldEdmond said.  I think at one month you should be able to sustain a forward-backward roll and alternating thumb roll, be able to switch back and forth between the two of them, and keep them relatively in time (doesn't have to be fast, but has to be consistent without pauses or flubs). You should also be able to do it without staring at your right hand.  I think at two months, you should be able to incorporate slides, pull-offs and hammer-ons with your rolls. They should be relatively clean and, again, be able to do them keeping the beat. I also think you should be able to play a C-chord and a D7 chord without a major pause between them (though this may take longer than two months).  After three months, you should at least have one song under your belt memorized. And you should be able to get through the song (not consistently, but after warming up you should be able to get through the whole song). It will likely be very slow.   Of course this depends on how much you have been able to devote to the instrument, how much knowledge you have (have you played another instrument?) and how much dexterity you have. Sometimes this goes faster, sometimes it takes a lot longer."
banjo,3e0nka,banjoman74,4,Tue Jul 21 03:38:31 2015 UTC,"Focus on the rolls. Youll need a forward roll, backward roll, square roll, and forward-reverse roll. When you can do them without thinking, the rest will fall into place. The left hand is going to be easier than on a guitar. With your 3 main chord shapes and rolls you will be able to fake your way through almost anything."

banjo,3dvyk8,pantsforsatan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:00:29 2015 UTC,I record down to a 1960 reel to reel with its original microphone. It's very difficult to get the sound even as banjos can suddenly get very loud.  I would try muting with a cushion or something damper than a shirt and try to get the levels right by pointing the mic more towards your voice than the banjo.
banjo,3dvyk8,CaptMorgHamOrg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:15 2015 UTC,"Is getting another condenser mic out of the question?  If not, getting another ~100$ mic and recording stereo, one mic specifically for banjo and one for vocals would be ideal.    If however that's not an option, I've found that a good position that works is sitting down with your banjo, and placing the mic upside-down pointed directly at the ground, with the mic about a foot/foot and a half from both your mouth and the part of the banjo where the neck meets the drum.  And it might help to take the shirt off, so that you can get the best and most authentic to the banjo sound possible."
banjo,3dvyk8,Ron-Jeremy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:44:33 2015 UTC,It becomes far too loud without the shirt inside of it. Or in the case that you are suggesting I don't wear a shirt while playing I would agree it does make for a more authentic sound.

banjo,3drhvu,nikabrik,3,Sun Jul 19 05:33:26 2015 UTC,The string at the top of each bar is the bottom (closest to the floor) string on the banjo..   Its hard to explain but yeah the string 'closest' to your head is the bottom string on that page. The open G (or A in that case because of Capo).   In open tuning that would look like..  D B G D g (its the short string and its an octave(?) higher than the other G)

He plays with a capo on the second fret open g tuning/standard. The progression is (d) 00230 (em) 02030 (bum) 04030 (g)00030. Before the last chord he does a pulls off sometimes on the third string from second fret to open. In terms of picking patterns, hopefully you can more or less hear what he's doing from the videos. I don't know how he plays the end so fast with a pick though, so I had to come up with my own roll for that."

But that's not a good banjo and you could pay just a little bit extra and get something quite a lot better.  Also, if you're going to play clawhammer, you probably don't want to have a resonator banjo, you'll want an open-back, maybe something with a frailing scoop. Not to say old-time doesn't sound good on bluegrass banjos, but you'll likely not be too popular if you start going to sessions :)  I'd highly recommend going to a music shop and trying a few within your budget rather than getting something off Amazon. It's unlikely it'll be setup well when it reaches you and you'll have no idea if you'll get along with it or not. Banjos are pretty commonly found in music stores these days.

banjo,3di2be,ocustar,4,Thu Jul 16 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"Just pick up a banjo and start strumming. When I'm learning a new song I start with figuring out the chords. I don't worry about picking or figuring out the tune (well, actually I do either/or starting with tune or chords, but I mostly start with chords). I just strum the chords like I would on a guitar. This helps me get the base for the song, then I can start worrying about playing it ""right."""
banjo,3di2be,carlius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:15 2015 UTC,but would you suggest a four or five string banjo?

banjo,3di4ri,Leedubs1,2,Thu Jul 16 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean bass guitar rather than double bass. The techniques are very different as is the sonic space these instruments take up in the mix in which they generally find themselves. However, experience with a fretted instrument will give you a head start over someone who is picking up the banjo never having played any fretted instrument."
banjo,3di4ri,arowan,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:39 2015 UTC,You are correct with your assumption. I chose the banjo because I already play with a multi finger style on the bass and figured it might be semi transferable to the 'jo. After some research I see more differences than similarities. Which is fine by me as expanding my musical abilities was the goal. I look forward to posting my progression here with you fine people for critique and suggestion.

banjo,3di4ri,SuddenlyTheBatman,2,Thu Jul 16 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"I initially learned from books and CDs, but that was pre-internet. There's lots of good beginners' instruction available on Youtube.

banjo,3di4ri,UncleEck,2,Thu Jul 16 17:14:06 2015 UTC,It really becomes second nature once you work on rolls. Drone notes especially. Your thumb automatically wants to hit it. You're not really going to fret it that much. At least I haven't and I'm a beginner. I just used books and started basically in a blank slate mindset. Sure tab reading helped but you just gotta start with tiny steps. You'll get to bigger ones in no time.

banjo,3di4ri,MyLittleFedora,3,Thu Jul 16 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"I did. You'll have to stretch the left hand out a little, you'll probably fall naturally into a two or three fingered bass playing style and the scale patterns and such are considerably easier on the bass."
banjo,3di4ri,Zummy20,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'd say any stringed instrument experience is a benefit. If you can do slap bass then clawhammer style might not seem as ""weird"" at first."

banjo,3di4ri,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been playing bass for like 12 years. I actually picked up the banjo about 2 years ago. Love it. There are lots of similarities. You'll already have coordination of the left hand, similar to all fretted instruments. The bass and the banjo scale are similar. I think if you line up the banjo nut at the 2nd or 3rd fret on your bass the scales are exactly the same. You'll also have a bunch of the basic right hand motor skills for finger picking. The new thing is the thumb and if you choose, the thumb pick. I started by learning clawhammer and suggest Ken Perlman's book Clawhammer Style Banjo. If you want to go straight to three finger style, happy banjo dude is awesome. Suggestion about three finger style; don't practice just one song with one roll. you'll get stuck on that roll and it becomes even harder to learn another roll. Keep trying new ones as you practice. Have fun. Oh and whatever banjo you have or get... replace the tuners."
banjo,3di4ri,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. May I ask why you suggest swapping the tuners?

That said, I think it's better to just buy a nicer banjo to start. Putting money into a bad banjo is just throwing money away. For $200+$100 you can get a very low-quality banjo with nice tuners. For $300, you might be able to find an actual decent banjo."

banjo,3dch2j,radiodialdeath,3,Wed Jul 15 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"/u/banjoman74 posted a really good ""buying used"" guide at some point in the past. Might be able to find it if you search around.  Regarding arthritis and clawhammer. Clawhammer is not finger picking and fingerpicking is not clawhammer. They are two separate and distinct styles. Here's a video detailing the most common methods of playing banjo, the second type that he calls old time is clawhammer style. There are other methods, these are just the two most common. I would guess that of all the styles, clawhammer is probably the best for someone with limited finger flexibility or arthritis because you don't really move your fingers much when you do it, it's all in the wrist/arm. It's much more strumming than finger picking."
banjo,3dch2j,_stonecoldsaidso,3,Wed Jul 15 05:44:57 2015 UTC,"A major thing you want to do is take off the resonator and look carefully at the rim.  The rim on a RK20 is laminated. If there is any water damage, there may be separation of the laminates, so make sure the rim is still solid.  Additionally, make sure that no one cranked on the coordinator rods and cracked the rim. Just look around the washers and see if there are any wood cracks.  The only other thing I would suggest checking is to make sure there is no heel crack on the neck. Those are rare, but they can happen.  All the rest is more related to a guitar. Twisted neck, wear on frets, cracked neck.   Finger picks are easier on the joints, but there can still be quite a bit of muscle when you finger pick on a banjo. If fingerpicking isn't a good therapy for your arthritis, clawhammer will definitely be better fro your arthritis."
banjo,3dch2j,banjoman74,2,Wed Jul 15 13:31:28 2015 UTC,"Been playing guitar 15 years as well and Scruggs style banjo for a little over a year.    I can't relate to the joint pain but as a classical guitarist and a banjo player, it's definitely easier on your fingers to use fingerpicks.    Buy some finger picks and play guitar with them to be sure though."
banjo,3dch2j,mungchampion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:19:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would bet that clawhammer would be less of a problem than scruggs. With clawhammer you keep your fingers bent a good bit, but aren't doing a whole lot of individual work with them (besides the thumb). If you look at one of the many tutorials on how to do clawhammer you should be able to get the basic motion down on a guitar to see if it causes pain. Same with fingerpicksfor scruggs."
banjo,3dch2j,meem1029,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:46:53 2015 UTC,I always speculated that clawhammer was popular among miners who had really bad arthritis from swinging picks all day and had limited manual dexterity. You don't have to move your fingers much at all to play it.
banjo,3d59hj,frogbob,11,Mon Jul 13 17:06:08 2015 UTC,"Speed requires precision of movement.  It may sound counter-intuitive, but the best way to develop precision is by slowing down.  Practice your scales with a metronome at slower speeds, 60-80 bpm, focusing on making very precise motions with your fingers.  Any unnecessary motion of your fingers wastes time and energy, and thus slows you down.  Once you get to where you can smoothly play the scale at a slow speed, start increasing your speed.  Only increase speed when you feel very comfortable at the previous speed.   Another issue you'll want to focus on is relaxation.  Any tension in your wrists, arms, shoulders, and even your back will reduce your ability to play fast.  When you start to cramp up at higher speeds, stop and try to figure out where you are tensing up, so you can relax again and continue on."
banjo,3d59hj,PierreLunaire,4,Mon Jul 13 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"This guy has it right. Precision and relaxation are key, and lots of repetition is the way to get both."
banjo,3d59hj,Adddicus,5,Mon Jul 13 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Time. Practice. You'll look back in a year and realize how much progress you've made. Keep rolling.
banjo,3d59hj,heebiestevo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"/u/PierreLunaire's response is right on. I just want to emphasize the ""practice with a metronome"" Practicing with a metronome and slowly increasing the tempo as you get everything down will do wonders for your sound and speed.  Edit: also practicing for short periods of time every day is better than practicing for hours every few days. Consistency is key."
banjo,3d59hj,thorrior,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"Can't add anything more than what's already been said, but maybe if you showed a video of you playing focused on your fingers people could check if there are any obvious suggestions to make about your technique?"

banjo,3d0co5,frogbob,5,Sun Jul 12 12:44:57 2015 UTC,"Is it an 11"" pot?  You could try something like this  https://www.goldtone.com/product/b1051-cc-model/  Attached with this hardware  https://www.goldtone.com/product/b1071-13-resonator-hardware/  You should call Goldtone and make sure it will fit your banjo. But it will cost you more than your banjo probably did. The main benefit is that you will get a little more forward projection of your tone. I have a CC-50RP which comes with a resonator. I took the resonator off when I started to play more clawhammer and the change in tone was minimal. If you are looking for more of a bluegrass sound then changing your setup, tightening up the head and adjusting the angle of the tailpiece will have more of an impact than adding a resonator."
banjo,3d0co5,morgensd,2,Sun Jul 12 18:49:48 2015 UTC,Seems a little crazy to put ~$250 worth of equipment on a $150 banjo.

banjo,3d0co5,morgensd,3,Tue Jul 14 05:12:50 2015 UTC,You can find resonator banjos for about the same price as your current one. It might make more sense to buy one and sell your old one and save the amazing amount of hassle on retrofitting it.
banjo,3d0co5,TakeItFromJoe,-2,Mon Jul 13 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"When installing a resonator device, it is important to keep a few variables in mind:   first- is there depth in the instrument to hold the reso hardware( cone,spider,plate).  Secondly- will you be able to adjust the bridge height and action to make room for the cone (would most likely have to play with slide dobro style)  Thirdly- nature of the instrument (dobro has much sustain due to resonator/action vs. the attack of the banjo.   All this being said, I'm a huge fan of converts-- I've seen a dobro with banjo head put inside of the guitar body where cone goes. Though the reason for this type of mod not being popular, is because of the difficult modifications and polar qualities of the instruments.. Though bluegrass dobro features many banjo rolls!   If you're looking for volume, LR bagge and fishman make excellent pickups-- though if you're curious about resonators, come to the dobro side!!! Scheerhorn cones are some of the best around. Whether it's for this project or you get a starter dobro and want to upgrade hardware here's a link to the cones:  http://www.elderly.com/accessories/items/SRC1.htm"
banjo,3d0co5,dangerkeegan,3,Sun Jul 12 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"i think you're thinking of the wrong kind of resonator. I am almost 100% sure OP means the backplate kind... you know, a banjo resonator."

The way I do it is just track your guitar, throw on some headphones and listen to the guitar track while you pick banjo on the next track. 3rd track for vox and bam! Adjust your levels and upload to YouTube. Then post in /r/banjo and reap that sweet sweet karma!"

banjo,3cqymc,banjoman74,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"I use a Zoom H2n  I really like recording our band with it. The really nice thing is you can set up a wave pattern to record 360 degrees. It will record in stereo on two different channels. This effectively allows you to somewhat adjust volumes on four channels once you bring it into Garageband. So during practice, I set it in the middle and record us playing.  Here's us using the Zoom H2n on the song 'Across the Great Divide'."

banjo,3coxj4,MadDogTannen,5,Thu Jul 9 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"That is actually a difficult song, not because of its complexity (that part is actually pretty easy since it uses the same roll all the way through the main parts), but because of its speed. To play along with the song, for example, takes quite a bit of practice and speed training. Good luck!  Check out ""happybanjodude"" for a wicked tutorial.  Edit: ...totally didn't answer your question. Lol"
banjo,3coxj4,ididntsaygoyet,3,Thu Jul 9 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, happybanjodude was where I found the banjo tabs in the first place, and his videos helped me a lot so far.  I agree, it's the speed that's difficult because the rolls are the same and it's just a few chord shapes for most of the song.  It's so fast though that I can't imagine ever being able to play at that speed (and we actually play a little faster than the albums in my band).  My plan was to slow the track way down in Audacity while I play along with it and gradually increase the speed over time until I feel like I have it.  Is that a good approach, and is it something that's doable for a beginner or am I looking at years before I can play like that?"
banjo,3coxj4,homer858,3,Thu Jul 9 17:15:44 2015 UTC,It depends on how fast you learn and your guitar experience. The chords and picking pattern is easy. The speeds the only issue. Just start slow and take your time.
banjo,3coxj4,homer858,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the speed that I'm worried about.  I'm a pretty advanced guitar player, and I do a fair amount of finger picking on guitar, but the speed of the rolls in that song are crazy."
banjo,3coxj4,homer858,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:45 2015 UTC,"Are you using fingerpicks? If you aren't, get some. They help a bunch with speed. The thing to focus on is being smooth. Don't look at your hands, and as much as possible don't focus on your individual fingers.  Practice until you can do that, and then start speeding up. It'll get to be muscle memory."
banjo,3coxj4,gravytrain2012,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"I bought some fingerpicks, but I haven't tried using them yet because I figured they'd feel really unnatural and I'd get frustrated, but I can definitely see how they'd help improve speed.  One concern of mine with fingerpicks is that I'll have to switch between guitar and banjo on stage fairly quickly, and I figured it would be hard to get the fingerpicks on and off that quickly, but I guess I need to practice putting the fingerpicks on just as much as I need to practice playing with them.  I've definitely found that the stronger I get with the chord shapes on my left hand, the more smooth my rolls get with my right hand because my attention isn't divided as much.  I just gotta keep working on that muscle memory."
banjo,3coxj4,person9,2,Thu Jul 9 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"You really need the picks to play that fast and clearly. It's neigh impossible with the pads of your fingers and thumb. They'll be weird for a while, but it's worth it to get used to them.   As for speed getting them on and off, it's super easy if they're fitted properly. get some pliers and shape the band until it slides smoothly on and off your finger, but grips so that it won't come off.  Often this involves ovaling it a bit if your fingers are flatter, or twisting the bands some to match the taper of your fingertip. I'd also recommend twisting the blade of the pick slightly counter clockwise. This will make it contact the string at a better angle, on the body of the blade, not the edge."

banjo,3coxj4,doctorcaesarspalace,2,Thu Jul 9 18:42:28 2015 UTC,Easy banjo part...when it's slowed down!  Work with a metronome slow and clean at first and gradually bump up the speed.    I'm more of a clawhammer guy but for a while I was in a band that played that song along with some of the others you described.  Took a while to build up the speed and since I haven't done much rolling since we went our ways I've lost that speed.  Just takes some time and good practice.
banjo,3cntmk,220090,3,Thu Jul 9 10:19:56 2015 UTC,"Double check that the pick stays at a proper angle when you attack the string. You may be getting too relaxed while playing, which is good, but you want proper technique when youre relaxed too."
banjo,3cntmk,Zummy20,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:44:27 2015 UTC,"What is the ""proper"" angle?"
banjo,3cntmk,flyingfences,2,Thu Jul 9 15:56:33 2015 UTC,Usually when the pick lays flat against the string. That will provide a sharp crisp attack.  If youre using a guitar pick a very slight angle is sometimes prefered as it allows you to up and down pick alternatively with a little more ease.

It used to be the Deering Crossfire until the prices went crazy on those (in my opinion)  For higher end, most people go with one of the electric banjos offered by Nechville.  Those may be too high for what you're looking for.  Pete Wernick used to use a phase shifter on his banjo - for those who may be interested to hear what effects you could use on a banjo.

You're best option to sound more electric is to add some compression. I use the boss compressor on my solos for a little volume boost and it adds a gnarly little tone as well. I can send some links to live recordings if you're interested. I also keep a wah wah and and an octave pedal in my chain, I think you'd have some fun with those too.   I'd suggest taking your banjo to a guitar shop asking them if you can play around with their pedals a bit. You may get some funny looks when you do this."

banjo,3cj5ca,schmokeymang,2,Wed Jul 8 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what u/schmokeymang said.  I think compression is HUGE when playing a banjo through pedals, especially if you're hoping to get any kind of ""dirty sound"". I have started to become a bit of a ""pedal addict"" but I don't tend to use many of them in a live setting.  One of the biggest problems I have found with using guitar pedals with banjo is the lack of natural sustain. A compressor can help with this a little bit.  I play a Dean Backwoods 2 in a folk/punk/celtic/thrashgrass?/rock band and I play fairly clean, but I do occasionally use a EHX Pitchfork live to add lower octaves. Other than that my live pedals mostly consist of a compressor and EQ.  You should definitely take your banjo to a shop or borrow some pedals from a friend and just experiment."

banjo,3ccxms,Karate_donkey,3,Mon Jul 6 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"It could be that the bridge is out of place, or that the action is too high, or that your capo is simply too tight.  And yes, you tune your 5th string up to A, or you can get a 5th string capo, or railroad spikes installed on your banjo."
banjo,3ccxms,Adddicus,3,Mon Jul 6 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"It's not unusual to have to retune slightly after putting on a capo.  I use a shubb capo and if the adjustment screw is not set properly, the capo presses down with too much force and the strings will be go sharp. The capo should press down with just enough force for the strings to ring cleanly."
banjo,3ccxms,morgensd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"1) yes, the 5th string should be A. Some retune it, others use a tiny railroad spike at the 7th fret for this. Those are very handy and one breaks fewer strings that way - you can get one installed at a knowledgeable music store.  2) guaranteed your bridge is way too far up. Here how to adjust it: hit one of the open strings. Then hit it again, fretted at the 12th fret. They should be the same note, an octave apart. You can use a tuner here btw to be sure - but it's not the actual note that matters, just which (open or fretted) is higher (not counting the octave).  If the fretted note is higher (likely in your case) then shove the bridge back toward the tailpiece (hold each end between fingers and thumb and shove along the head. Not a big deal if it falls over with a bang, but you have to tip it up again and put the strings back in their slots). As a wild guess I'd suggest about half an inch the first time, and in smaller increments after.  If the fretted note is lower (or you pushed the bridge too far), push it up toward the neck.  Check several strings doing this - likely you'll need to angle the bridge a little bit to get the best average across all of them. Don't bother checking the fifth string since it's rarely fretted.   Once in the right spot, mark it in light pencil - next time it slips you can get ballpark very quickly. The ""ideal"" precise location is somewhat fluid and changes with the strings and their age and moon phase; you might have to adjust slightly again, away from the mark, down the road.  After the notes are equal you can tune the string to the appropriate note.   Oh - if you do the above with the capo already on for A, remember it's 12 frets from the capo so it's the 14th fret along the neck."

banjo,3c7kjz,SkeevyPete,2,Sun Jul 5 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"have you been moving the chords up three steps?  In the link you gave, it says capo the third fret. Which means that all their chord names are chord /shapes/. What that means is that D isn't actually a D but an F.  Whenever you come across capo'd guitar music you have to learn to move the chords up by how ever many steps the capo is at. Since the capo is on the third fret, we move up three.  D Eb E F  If you're unsure how to count up, just count up using this:  C, C#, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C  D -> F  Bm -> Dm  Em -> Gm  A -> C  Use those chords instead. What the capo did was change the key of the song, so you have to adjust the chords to play along with it.  You could use the chords as written and sound fine by yourself, but you're playing in a different key, so thats where the mishap is coming from."

banjo,3c5bxc,Rebuhl,3,Sun Jul 5 02:45:54 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple, it's basically just a series of pinches to keep the rhythm going. After you get the basics down, things like sliding into the chord, holding the chop, skipping chops, etc. can liven up your backup. Just remember the number 1 rule of playing backup: You're assisting, not trying to steal the spotlight. If it's not helping the person playing the break, stop doing it.  A good thing to do when learning songs is to practice it 4 ways. 1, melody. 2, backup chops. 3, improvised break. 4 rolling backup.   The master of backup IMO is J. D. Crowe. Listen to his stuff, especially with the New South, paying special attention to what he does when others take a break.  Side note: Replace the Em with a C and you've got Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Breakdown. Replace it with a G and you've got Stanley Brothers' Train 45. Though those are usually capo'd up and played in different keys."

banjo,3c4a9w,bassface3408,2,Sat Jul 4 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"A hobby store would possibly have them,  not a craft store I don't think.    I have them on my banjo.  They are tricky. Not only is the height important, the placement to either side of the string is important to avoid having to retune every time; and they are, after all, a nail.  If you don't get it right the first time and sink them too deep, they will loosen when you pull them back out.   Though I am a professional handyman, I went to a guitar repairman I trust to have them put in, and he spikes. Edit: he had spikes."

banjo,3c4a9w,myboxissharp2,2,Sun Jul 5 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"i just did mine. some things i learned for next time.  the tiny drill bit doesn't fit in a regular drill chuck. i ended up wrapping it with tape to make do, but i put the drill down funny and the weight of the drill snapped the bit. i would suggest finding the proper hobby drill if you plan on making this perfect or doing it on several banjos. as for the placement, drill your hole directly beside the string on the bottomside, so the bit is a fraction of a thou from touching the string. if you place it too far down the fret pulling the string under stretches the note out of tune. if you are the ocd type measure and mark with an awl or something else pointy before you drill your holes. the first hole i drilled the bit moved because i only marked with a pencil and it stretches the string out of tune a we bit, the rest just look a bit messy cuz they aren't perfectly in line but they stay in tune. it can be done without the feeler gauge but it does take a lot of the guess work/fiddling out of the height placement. when you are done just check to see that the spikes are just low enough that they don't touch the string when the previous spike are engaged. other than that i followed the same tutorial as /u/morgensd posted earlier, if you have basic fine measuring skills and the proper tools you should have very little problem. over all i am happy with the out come but looking at them you can tell it was my first time."

I would think about having a smaller room. Or even with the room that you're in, you can lay down a thick blanket (like a duvet) where you're recording. You may want to play around with the distance the mic is away from you. Too far away, more echo. Too close, it may max out.   I would suggest playing at about four different distances, then listen to the recordings and see which one works the best.   Your banjo playing sounds great though. And the recording doesn't sound that bad for it coming from a phone."

I managed to catch them way back in the mid-90s (right after Sackcloth and Ashes came out) at the Reading Festival in England.

banjo,3bnheq,HardpointNomad,2,Wed Jul 1 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. We always went to folk festivals and stuff as a kid, so that's probably part of it. I've always liked the sound of bluegrass and old time music. I've definitely always had a spot in my heart for the unique sound of a banjo, even if I didn't realize it fully until recently.  In more recent times and more directly, I'd say that Yonder Mountain String Band really got me into the sound of bluegrass. I was and am into jam bands and music festivals, I'm a total deadhead too so Jerry Garcia was an influence as well I guess. I always liked it, but YMSB was what made me dive into it. After a while I realized that many of their songs are just covers of old standards, which lead me to John Hartford and then on to Old and In the Way, and then the rest of bluegrass. I've also always liked Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, but honestly I never really identified them as 'banjo music' until after I got a banjo. That said, I didn't get really into it until I started thinking about playing the banjo.   What got me into banjo? I was attending a lot of smaller folk festivals, and there's always jams after the stage closed. I just really wanted to participate, everyone seemed like they were having so much fun. I was tired of sitting on the sidelines. Most of the jams had 5 guitars for every other instrument, so I figured I'd go for a more traditional instrument to fill the gaps. Bass was too expensive and bulky, and to be honest, banjo seemed like it was easier than fiddle or mandolin. Then I found a community college workshop series that offered 8 classes for 60 dollars, so I jumped on that and got a banjo. This is the point that I really started to get into bands like The Tillers, Red Tail Ring, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades, Pert Near Sandstone, Adam Hurt, and others I can't remember right now. I also started digging deeper into stuff like Clarence Ashley and some of the older artists. Since I've started playing, I listen almost exclusively to old time and bluegrass music whereas before I was always listening to jam bands and the Grateful Dead.  Artists I want to emulate? I don't know. I just want to play fiddle tunes with a fiddler. If an artist does that, then I want to emulate them."

banjo,3bn0qf,blancjua,2,Tue Jun 30 15:10:55 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to start out would be to take your fifth string off, tune to CGBD (Moyses uses DGBD, but that's less common on plectrum) and start learning chord charts up the neck.

banjo,3bn0qf,MyLittleFedora,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:34:25 2015 UTC,Blacjua doesn't really need a different string set for Chicago tuning on his banjo. Its a 5 string with the fifth removed. Any standard 5 string banjo set could easily tune to DGBE and those sets you linked to are pretty close to 5 string gauges without the fifth.

One really neat thing I like it's tuning to a double C in the open position so,  double A. Jets a video of it in action: http://youtu.be/hTomMrqNzk4  All in all I love it and you can find a vintage high end LN for a good price if you know what to look for. Gibson and Vega made LNs are the best I've had my hands on though I did consider buying the exact one mentioned earlier in this thread  a few years ago before I got the gibson. I find the extra useful and my wife likes it as well since she favors the key of F on some songs. I did install a fifth string capo as well. Ultimately, the best reason to have it is just to have the option to move down."

banjo,3bjw66,UncleEck,3,Tue Jun 30 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you. I just think the whole long neck thing never really made sense for the general banjo-playing population, and was mostly just a product of people copying what they saw Pete Seeger doing. Pete Seeger was 6'3'' with incredibly long arms and he came up with the whole design to fit his voice and playing and others followed suit. The problem is that most people aren't built the way Pete was, and the long neck is not particularly ergonomic as well as being very poorly balanced against the mass of the pot which gives you a very neck-heavy banjo. Additionally, a lot of regular scale-length banjos sound great tuned low and you can easily capo up to get to regular pitches."
banjo,3bj7bj,folkfilm,22,Mon Jun 29 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"Shocking, I know, but this may become long-winded.  I have very mixed feelings about Mumford & Sons. I typically have no problems with bands like this. A lot of times, a ""watered down"" (maybe not the best way to describe them) version of a genre of music will hit mainstream. As a result, people who normally would never be exposed to it start to dig deeper, and through that digging, they are introduced to a whole new world of music.  ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is a very good example. Through that music, a band like Del McCoury was able to become recognized and become very successful, even though he had nothing to do with the original soundtrack. Eric Clapton introduced many people to Muddy Waters. Roy Clark introduced banjo players to Bobby Thompson. Garth Brooks introduced people to George Strait and Chris Ledoux.  It's funny, for a lot of people, once they get their feet wet deep into the genre, they tend to lose interest in the original band that first exposed them. I had a friend who was into AC/DC and Motley Crue (around 1990). He went to a Garth Brooks concert and loved the energy. He started listening to Garth Brooks. Then listened to more country. He started listening to Chris Ledoux and George Jones and George Strait. In one year's time, he was telling me how he thought Garth Brooks was too pop-oriented.   The issue I have with Mumford & Sons is that they seem like they almost hold the genre of music that made them famous in contempt. Eric Clapton would gladly tell you that Muddy Waters was a much better guitar player than him. Garth Brooks sung about George Strait and Chris Ledoux (and mentioned them in awards). Roy Clark would feature Bobby Thompson on Hee Haw.   That's my issue with Mumford & Sons. They seem to go out of their way to talk about the fact that they have no interest in the genre. And they talk trash about the music. It's very strange to me.   Trampled By Turtles and Old Crow Medicine Show seem to have a greater respect for artists (both present and past), and have a knowledge and a sophistication of the music.   So, in short, I like that they introduce people to different forms of music. I hate that they appear to have to respect for the music. Perhaps I am misinformed about them."
banjo,3bj7bj,banjoman74,3,Mon Jun 29 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"Perfect example of the O Brother Where Art Thou point.   That movie is my #1 all time favorite.  Before I even saw the movie, I listened to the soundtrack CD in my Dad's car endlessly.  And my love for the music translated perfectly to the tone of the movie, and because of that, I bought myself a banjo!  And here I am, I have branched out to so many fantastic musicians and discovered a genre that I can connect with and enjoy wholly more than any I have ever come across."
banjo,3bj7bj,HeyItsDaft,2,Tue Jun 30 01:16:22 2015 UTC,I recently saw Mumford live and the contempt for the genre and the banjo was pretty obvious in their playing. Ironically when they played their old songs with banjo it was much more effective on the crowd.

Granted, I was really young when I got into them, but I hadn't really explored anything other than alternative rock or pop before becoming a fan. Through them I've slowly discovered more and more bands until I was at the likes of Trampled by Turtles, Punch Brothers, and Old Crow. Though, honestly, I'm still a major fan of their music. They put on a wonderful live show. And I'll always be thankful to them for showing 13 year old me that banjos are kinda cool. Now I know banjos are the coolest. Thanks for the insightful reply!!

I'm also not convinced that their music played a big role in banjo's recent rise in popularity.  All that said, I don't know why they had to be all dickish about ditching banjo and their ""folky"" sound. I guess they were trying to shed the folk label but really all it does is get a chunk of your fan-base off side.

banjo,3bbege,EMarkM_DM,3,Sat Jun 27 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"Yuuuuup. It's just a matter of training you fingers over time. If you're playing the full D chord, the only finger that could be muting the others is the pinkey. If the two finger D, then the pointer or middle. Figure out where the problem is a practice slowly and intentionally."
banjo,3bbege,homer858,3,Sat Jun 27 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"I have an easy version of Wildwood Flower that uses D and the D shape further down the neck. Having a song with it in it, helped immensely and made it less boring.   Another way, but a bit more boring but more helpful, is to practice your rolls going G-C-D-G-C-D over and over again. That is a good bluegrass progression, so you might as well get your fingers used to moving that way. Use a metronome, and just go slow with your rolls. Don't increase your speed until you can get it well enough  at a slower speed.   Remember, you are training your muscles and the speed WILL come, you just have to put the practice time in first."
banjo,3bbege,RanchRelaxo,4,Sat Jun 27 19:10:03 2015 UTC,Well you should really learn how to do the closed chord version but you can just fret the bottom three strings leaving the 4th open D string open.

The frets were very worn and I really didn't want to waste time re-fretting a cheap old Japanese banjo, so instead I wasted time making it semi-fretless.

banjo,3b7chl,banjoman74,2,Fri Jun 26 16:27:39 2015 UTC,Cadillac Sky (Matt Menefee)  Frank Solivan and Dirty Kitchen (Mike Munford)  Country Gazette (Alan Munde)  Chatham County Line (Chandler Holt)  Reno and Smiley (Don Reno)  Punch Brothers (Noam Pikelny)  There's a good start for some interesting bluegrass. No clawhammer though.
banjo,3b7chl,meem1029,2,Fri Jun 26 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"One clawhammer song I loved while learning (while, I'm still learning) is Annabelle Lee by Sarah Jarosz. It's fairly simple but still a great song."
banjo,3b7chl,ratcheer,2,Fri Jun 26 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"I just want to say, for getting your bf a banjo, I think I love you ;-)  I play clawhammer, but almost exclusively old time and fiddle tunes. Lots of great sources in the sidebar for that but you guys have the right impulse: the real magic is in playing WITH people. Finding jams in your area might be a good place to meet people and learn more, just keep in mind that many public jams can have a lot of beginners so aren't always the fullest expression of ""hot"" you could experience... A good place to locate other players is music stores that have a good banjo and acoustic guitar selection. You'll find flyers perhaps, or the clerks will have good leads.  Where are you located? Someone here might have a good lead for your area."
banjo,3b7chl,EMarkM_DM,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:55:29 2015 UTC,"Well, you've got your two main playing styles, plus an almost infinite number of variations.  The two main styles are bluegrass (fingerpicks) and clawhammer (back of the fingernail and fleshy part of the thumb).  I play a little of both, but many folk concentrate just on one style out of the two.  I suggest you both give YouTube a bit of a listen for both styles, and see what sort of stuff you'd like to play together.  Note: this comment assumes a traditional five string banjo - I have no experience with, nor comment on, tenor banjos, plectrum banjos or banjitars.  Good luck and have fun - it's a hard, complex journey which is found by many people to be far more frustrating than guitar, but the rewards are huge."

banjo,3b45l6,amanset,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:57:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much you know about the banjo, but there are two basic styles:  Clawhammer, which is derived from African techniques brought over with the slave trade and is associated with a more old fashioned sound. The player in the video you linked is playing clawhammer.  Three finger, or Scruggs style, developed in its modern form by Earl Scruggs back in the 1950s. Here's Scruggs playing Foggy Mountiain Breakdown, one of the most famous banjo tunes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQIJuu3N5EY"
banjo,3b45l6,bobtheghost33,3,Thu Jun 25 23:14:52 2015 UTC,"There are many banjo playing styles outside of clawhammer and Scruggs style. Also, Scruggs joined the Blue Grass Boys in the '40s and was already playing his influential 3 finger style in 1945."
banjo,3b45l6,UncleEck,3,Fri Jun 26 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Also there were several people doing the same thing as Earl around the same time, he just happened to be the one to popularize the style which would eventually be named after him."
banjo,3b45l6,BanjoCAB,2,Fri Jun 26 04:00:48 2015 UTC,"Snuffy Jenkins did some stuff similar to Scruggs back then, but Earl took it to a whole new level."
banjo,3b0jh9,tylermosk,5,Thu Jun 25 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"Weirdly enough, most pre-1915 (or so) banjos have a marker at the 9th, except for SS Stewart instruments. Stewart had his own reasons for placing the marker at the 10th which are briefly summed up here:  http://www.banjothimble.com/Fret_Markings.html  Why other makers slowly switched from 9th to 10th in the early 20th century is a bit of a mystery and not a well-documented phenomenon. Vega, Bacon, and others did eventually switch over though."
banjo,3b0jh9,UncleEck,2,Thu Jun 25 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I had wondered about this for a while, it seems the 10th marker would be more useful if you're much more versed in music theory. Very interesting"
banjo,3b0jh9,homer858,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:40:40 2015 UTC,"The trick with all of these is that they only hold when un-capoed. I use a capo at the 2nd fret a lot, and when doing so the 7th fret becomes equivalent to 5th and 9th to 7th, so in first and second positions at least the 9th fret marker proves to be more useful. I also like it for symmetry's sake. There are dots every odd fret from 3-9, then 12, then every odd fret from 15-21. This leaves a two fret space on either side of the 12th fret which I think looks better than the alternate configuration. Ultimately, though their placement may be musically informed, they serve as visual reference and as long as the player can find they positions they serve their purpose."
banjo,3b0jh9,banjoman74,2,Thu Jun 25 06:39:07 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's because of the popularity of the tenor banjo during that time frame.  The tenor banjo would automatically have fret positioning that would mimic the fret positioning of a mandolin (which has the marker at the tenth). If Gibson (and other tenor banjo makers during that time) was doing inlay patterns on tenor banjos, you could see how they would keep the same fret markers for the fifth string banjos, which weren't as popular."
banjo,3b0jh9,UncleEck,2,Thu Jun 25 16:34:12 2015 UTC,Definitely a potential reason. A lot of early tenor banjo (and even earlier tango banjo) marketing was aimed at mandolin players and mandolins traditionally have a fret marker at the 10th rather than 9th.

banjo,3aws8l,kingfrito_5005,3,Wed Jun 24 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"The easy things to try are changing the bridge and the strings and head tension.  My guess is it sounds too guitar-y because it has too much sustain.  That can sometimes be caused by too much head tension.  Changing the head tension doesn't cost anything however it is tricky to get the tension even across the whole head. A softer head tension will dampen the sound and give you a thumpier feel.  Too much dampening isn't very good either.  Bluegrass banjos are often pretty tight and bright, clawhammer banjos are often set up a little softer and thumpier.  In general, thinner strings will sound a little tinnier and crisper.  Thicker strings will have more ""bottom"".  Clawhammer players often prefer a little more bottom and a little less ""ring"", but not always.  it is a personal preference.  Bridges can make dramatic changes in any direction.  Sometimes you have to try a few before you get one that sounds great.  Even two bridges that look exactly the same can sound different.  I usually make my own bridges, but when I've tried commercial ones I have had really good luck with Moon bridges - http://elderly.com/accessories/names/moon-bridge-heavy-weight-5/8""--BA93H5.htm ."

As well as the things he has listed, you might try a renaissance or fiberskyn (or even skin) head, and nylon strings.  Try to find a good sound or video clip of a clawhammer artist that has the sound you like, then post it here, and/or go over to the banjohangout.org forum, and ask how you can set up your banjo to get that sound."

If you also post on banjohangout, in the ""collectors corner"" area, and someone will tell you what it is, probably in about 5 min!  Looks like it is in good shape for what it is. A new bridge is probably in order, and new strings. Many of these types of banjos were not made for steel strings, so you may get advice to put nylgut / nylon strings on it.  savethebanjos.com has lots of images related to fixing up such instruments."
banjo,3acfr7,WaylonWillie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:01:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advise! I can't believe he was going to throw this out. Do you have any advise on where to begin fixing this up?
banjo,3acfr7,WaylonWillie,3,Fri Jun 19 13:43:05 2015 UTC,"To me it looks like it needs more of a cleaning than a fixing. If the neck is straight and the action is not too high, I wouldn't mess with it too much. The action on those old banjos is often much higher than we prefer these days. Maybe your first step should be to select some strings, and work on the bridge / nut setup. That will tell you if it is playable. If you choose to buy rather than make, a nut is usually around $30, and a bridge goes for anywhere between $5 and $40 for the fancy ones. Your question would be whether you can get a bridge that is high / low enough to provide you with a comfortable string height. If not, the dowel rod would need to be reset; that is not a disaster, but it is probably something you would want to leave to someone with experience (meaning a banjo luthier, not someone at guitar center!).  Any sort of ""guitar polish"" should be fine for the neck and inside the pot. Fingerboards and frets clean up nicely with some naptha and fine steel wool. (These old banjos often don't have a proper fingerboard, but just have the frets put right into the neck itself.)  For now, I would leave the peghead overlay as is.  Your tuning pegs could just be polished up. They are friction tuners, and will be easier to tune with nylon / nylgut strings. They should have a little thin leather washer between the metal of the peg and the peghead itself; so, they compress onto this leather, rather than compressing into the wood. Those often rot away....  The head has a nice old look to it, I would keep it. Surf around about head tension on skin heads, but don't obsess over this one. As long as the bridge isn't sagging too much, you'll be good to start.  Frets.com is a good source for all sorts of major / minor repairs.   Surfing here or banjo hangout is also good for all the other types of tweaks/repairs. Remember it is always best to leave it alone rather than mess it up...."

banjo,3a4cwy,JayTony,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:21:31 2015 UTC,I have a couple Avett Brother tabs for 5 string banjo. What's the tuning for tenor banjos?
banjo,3a2299,poguemahone_,4,Tue Jun 16 16:55:52 2015 UTC,Tom Hanway wrote a book specifically for playing Irish tunes on a 5 string.
banjo,3a2299,Adddicus,4,Tue Jun 16 23:42:37 2015 UTC,Tony Furtado.  It's not necessary to get different strings or tune differently.
banjo,3a2299,banjoman74,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:56:47 2015 UTC,I don't really see what he's playing in this video as having much to do with Irish Traditional music. The video I linked to in another comment is actually of someone playing ITM on a five-string:  https://youtu.be/BKExVr4jJ1s
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,2,Tue Jun 16 18:32:42 2015 UTC,You don't see how his style of playing would lend to Irish traditional music?
banjo,3a2299,banjoman74,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:49:35 2015 UTC,"In what sense? The common hurdle in playing ITM on a five string is getting the feel of the tunes, specifically the triplet-like rushed notes I've heard ITM players confusingly call the ""trebble"". A flatpick on a tenor is the accepted way of getting these notes out of a banjo, but as you can see in the video I linked to its achievable through alternating your picking fingers rapidly on the same string to produce a tremelo effect on a five string. That video of Tony Furtado doesn't really have anything to do with that aspect of the ITM feel to me."
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,2,Tue Jun 16 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"Using the D-string (if this link doesn't work, it's at about 1:23) as a drone string (with thumb and index) instead of a fifth-string drone provides a very Celtic feel when picking. Then picking the melody with the middle finger is an effective way of emulating a more Celtic-feel to music. Intermix that with double stops. That reminds me of backup on Irish Traditional music.  Straying away from the classic rolls and using more of a single-string method of playing is also an important step in learning more of the Irish Traditional fiddle tunes.  Depending on the style of Irish Traditional you are talking about - here is another effective method of playing non-traditional three-finger style of banjo (2:32).   Then at the 3:20 mark he's playing a more ballady type of playing, again, with double stops, that would lend well to more of the Irish ballads (though, in fairness, it's only for a short period of time)."
banjo,3a2299,banjoman74,-1,Tue Jun 16 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"""Celtic feel"" is an almost meaningless term in its vagueness. There's plenty of Celtic influence in bluegrass and old time, but they're distinctly different from the music people are generally referring to when they talk about Irish Traditional Music. The OP was talking about Irish Trad, not some kind of vague ""Irish-like"" music. That's something you're completely missing, and you can downvote me all you want and it won't change that. That Tony Furtado video has nothing to do with the techniques necessary to effectively play the types of reels, strathspeys, slip jigs etc that make up the typical ITM session. Did you watch the video I linked to?"
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,6,Tue Jun 16 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"Calm down. I'm not downvoting you. Someone else is. I asked for clarification and tried to answer your question. I have no problem with you disagreeing with me. But I'm not in the mood for an argument.  Yes, I watched the video you linked to. Yes, I understand the concept of 6/8 timing that is the root of the traditional jigs, reels, etc.  What I was explaining was the techniques that he is using can easily transfer over to the Irish Traditional music. I am happy to concede that I am not as well-versed in the Irish tradition of music that you so obviously are, and I am completely willing to bow out of this conversation.  However, I have played the banjo, and have played it in Irish jams with adept players (again, I'm definitely not adept at it, but I can fake it well enough that they didn't kick me out of the jam). And maybe that's where there is the difference (or maybe not), as I'm talking about technique, and you're talking about the style of music. Many of the techniques that Tony Furtado is using in this video, again... not timing but his actual techniques, lent well to playing that style (in my case). Getting out of that habit of thinking of rolls. Playing the bottom d-string with thumb and index and picking more of the melody with his index and middle finger, double stops and his syncopation. If you disagree or think I'm missing the point, that's fine. But you don't have to be antagnostic about it. I was talking from my experience. People can judge accordingly."
banjo,3a2299,banjoman74,2,Tue Jun 16 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"My apologies, I really wasn't trying to be antagonistic and I'm sorry if I came off that way. I just looked back at thread and saw my comments were all downvoted and I didn't see how anybody could feel that I wasn't contributing to the discussion. I find that downvoting behavior fairly toxic to actual discussion. I just felt that you were using generalities to imply that what Tony Furtado was doing was a path to getting an effective ITM sound out of a five string, and I didn't see it that way.   We're coming at this from different angles really. I don't think about most banjo playing primarily in terms or rolls and patterns and I think people from a bluegrass background do. I would argue that Furtado is just using patterns and rolls for the most part in that video, but they may seem more unique to you in that they don't conform to standard bluegrass rolls. I can see now that what you were looking at was more of a way of playing backup and not really an approach to ITM melody playing.  I'm not an ITM player really, but I do think there are specific characteristics to that music that require different techniques, and I didn't see those techniques demonstrated in the video you were citing."
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:08:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes sense.   On a completely different matter, the downvotes may be another discussion. I know there are some subreddits that have only upvotes and they remove the downvotes. If that's of interest, I can bring it up with the moderators. And you're right. Your comments prior were valid discussion items and weren't worthy of downvotes at all."
banjo,3a2299,banjoman74,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be fine to erase the down vote button with css. There's so little down vote worthy material here that I don't think many people would care.   That said, I've always maintained that downvotes and upvotes are pretty meaningless in a small subreddit that get at most 30 comments in any given post. The downvotes don't hide anything, and there's not enough comments to make the sorting even matter. So who cares if you get down voted?"

banjo,3a2299,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Wed Jun 17 11:41:15 2015 UTC,"Most ITM banjo players use a tenor banjo tuned GDAE from high to low (all fifths.) Tenors have shorter scale lengths than your typical five string, so it can be hard to get a comfortable, well-intonated all-fifths equivalent on a five sting.   That being said, I've seen and heard people who worked out ways of playing ITM on five-string banjos in more conventional tunings, the trick is to work out rolls and patterns that fit the triplet-heavy irish style. Here's an example:  https://youtu.be/BKExVr4jJ1s"
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,4,Tue Jun 16 18:06:48 2015 UTC,"The real trick is to throw away rolls. Single string style works best on a 5-string for playing Irish tunes IMO. That's what he's playing in the video you linked as well.   Using a flatpick, you'd do an alternate picking of down/up/down/up/down/etc. Using fingerpicks, you'll use your thumb for down and index (or middle) for up, i.e. thumb/index/thumb/index/thumb/etc.   For triplets, a flatpick will do a quick down/up/down or a quick up/down/up. For fingerpicks, you'll throw in your other finger. So, you'll do like a thumb/index/middle or index/thumb/middle or middle/thumb/index.   It sounds a LOT easier than it is, btw."
banjo,3a2299,Rebuhl,2,Wed Jun 17 03:47:40 2015 UTC,You can play Irish on a standard 5 string. The banjoist for The Pogues used a 5-string. And Bela Fleck plays Irish tunes sometimes. And here's Rob MacKillop playing Irish music on a 5-string banjorine.

banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,0,Wed Jun 17 20:23:04 2015 UTC,That's not at all relevant to his/her question.
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:31:13 2015 UTC,That's just a link to a website with reference tones for tuning a tenor banjo. The OP was asking about playing ITM on a regular five string banjo.
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,2,Tue Jun 16 17:57:49 2015 UTC,"No you couldn't. You would need different string gauges. You can't just comfortably tune any instrument to any tuning without changing the strings/capoing etc. If you want to get the fives string's D3G3B3D4 down to ITM tenor's G2D3A3E4 you need to tune the fourth string down 7 half steps and the third string down 5 half steps, leaving you with very floppy bass strings."
banjo,3a2299,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"Back in the day, players would just remove the 5th string and change their tuning. You could do this as well. You don't have to move the 5th if you don't want though.   Banjos are made to be retuned, so go wild with it."
banjo,3a2299,UncleEck,5,Tue Jun 16 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but removing the fifth string gives you basically a plectrum banjo, not a tenor banjo. The difference in scale length matters. You could potentially tune to a lower all-fifths tuning and capo up to GDAE."
banjo,3a2299,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Tue Jun 16 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Good point, I forgot about the scale length. But like you say, a capo could fixes scale length pretty quick. And it's cheaper than a new banjo."
banjo,3a2299,DixieDesperado,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"I'd expect the truss rod(/s) would require adjustment as well, were you to remove a string."
banjo,3a2299,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. Although the 5th string can't put much pressure on the neck, I'd imagine. And back then, I'm not sure how many people had truss rods in their banjo."

G-C-D-G-C-D-G-D-G-C-G-D-G, etc, ad nauseum. Just play around with it. Add some Em or A>D in there if you want. If you feel like you're playing the same sounds, try to learn the different chord positions (e.g. Barre at 5th fret for a different sounding C-chord, Barre at 7th fret for a different D-chord.) I do this exercise a lot and it's really helped with my improv/jamming ability. It's slow at first, and it does feel repetitive sometimes, but eventually you start hearing relationships and learning without even realizing it."

banjo,39zjpo,Rebuhl,4,Wed Jun 17 11:19:24 2015 UTC,"For genres that don't really mesh well with the onslaught of notes the banjo gives, start by attempting to emulate the instruments usually found in the genre.   For reggae, try chopping to attempt to emulate the guitar. A bluegrass chop is basically the same thing as a reggae chop. There's just a little speed and groove difference.  Or, try emulating the organ/piano. Try repeating something like this while lifting your fingers to mute the strings on or off the beat to make it more rhythmic:  d ----------7------- B -------5--5--5---- G -------5-----5---- D ---7-------------- g -------------------  (That's a Am, but you can use pretty much any chord)   Or, try to emulate the horns. The trick there is to play one note at a time and make sure they fully ring out. Also, don't play too many notes. If you can't whistle it, it's too many notes."

banjo,39y4y2,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:17:33 2015 UTC,"Well unfortunately, I don't think that's a banjo.  It sounds like a finger plucked guitar.  But there are similarities to be had.  If I would categorize it by closest approximation I'd say it's an alternating thumb forward backwards roll. 3-2-1-5-1-2-4-2-1-5-1-2. (see the mix of the first two) Which is not a standard ""roll"" since it's 12 notes long (rather than the standard 8).  This song appears to be in 6/8 (thus the 12 note phrase).  If this is the music you want to play, go for it! But you probably won't find along on online resources for it   I'd suggest Cripple creek as a great first song.  It has a bit of simple fingering and short roll segments.  It was the first song I've played which actually sounds like a song, not just a string of interspersed semi-randomly assembled sounds.  (Full disclosure: I am also very new to banjo. I'd call myself a progressing beginner.)"
banjo,39y4y2,realslowtyper,2,Mon Jun 15 21:38:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a banjo to me. And it sounds like a standard forward-backward roll, I think, no tricky timing that I can hear.

banjo,39y4y2,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Mon Jun 15 22:28:06 2015 UTC,I agree I think it sounds like a banjo. But if OP means a 5 string he'll have to fret the high g string in order to play it with a forward backward roll.  I am also an extreme amateur.

Are you counting the strings in the right order? 1st is closest to the ground, fifth is the short string closest to your head. The fourth string is the low D, and if you replaced it with the gauge you named, it should be thinner, not thicker, than the wound string it was replacing."

banjo,39v0c6,UncleEck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"That's how I found my (north of Boston) teacher. I can ask him if he knows anyone in Cambridge, as well, but my lesson isn't until Saturday. I've also found several jam sessions in my area so there are lots about.  Edit: There's also the music emporium in Lexington, which is a store and has lessons, but they might be able to connect you with someone closer too. They're an amazing resource, and also a good place to drool over banjos I can't afford."

banjo,39daii,SuddenlyTheBatman,2,Thu Jun 11 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"It's pretty common these days, especially for fingerstyle guitarists. I like them because they're much stronger than my natural nails so I can keep longer nails without worrying about them breaking. They're also a louder than natural nail, which is important to me because my banjo is on the quiet side. They do produce a more distinct click when you hit the strings playing clawhammer than a natural nail, but I don't mind it. I keep my ring finger natural because it produces a softer tone, and my cluck technique sounds better with natural nail as the first contact.   It's pretty easy to manage. I just go to the nail salon once every couple of weeks or so. It normally costs about 3 bucks a nail or thereabouts."

banjo,39daii,tripod280,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest making your own post out of this question. That being said, a combination forward-backward + forward makes a diverse sound.  The thing is though, once you start getting into playing the melodies of songs you'll drop the basing chord+roll pattern for more complex fret hand stuff and you'll be using a lot of different roll-patterns in sequence. I'd recommend practicing as many different patterns as you can now. So that later, piecing them together will come easier."
banjo,39daii,PotatoeCrusoe,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:39:07 2015 UTC,"For bluegrass, /u/PotatoeCrusoe 's coment is spot on. I play more old-time 3 finger myself, and that revolves around the alternating roll TITM. It all depends on the song though."

The shop sent me brass picks when I bought my banjo because they'd run out of nickel ones, and now I really identify with them.  I also aged them by suspending them in a jar with a small amount of ammonia overnight, so they're dull and tarnished. I love the look, and it matches my Brass Swamp Rock Slide. (Bought whilst transcribing Whelk Bone by John Dowling.)  I have to admit, though, that I don't practise with my picks enough. After years of fingerstyle guitar I'm used to using my nails, and it's too tempting to pick up my banjo and have the extra speed and fluidity. The picks sound great when I get them 'working', but I'm still having to work at them.  I also play a lot of clawhammer, so the nail of my middle finger sees a lot of use. :)"

banjo,39awqp,UncleEck,2,Wed Jun 10 17:26:10 2015 UTC,A lot of the timbre of that guitar part comes from the unusual open tuning (EBEEBE) and the unisons and drones it produces. You could play the fingered notes on a tenor banjo but I doubt it would capture the sound of the recording.

So to preface, I've been playing guitar on and off for a number of years, always been interested in banjo, just never got around to getting one.   This past weekend, The Mumford & Sons Gentlemen Of The Road Stopover happened in Seaside Heights, NJ, which is practically my backyard. Amongst the many awesome things there, Deering had a tent set up to give short lessons and demos to anyone there. I got a short lesson (mostly just barre chords, but hey, still fun) and totally got the itch. While I didn't really have the funds at the moment to get a deering, I ended up getting an Epiphone Mb-100, and am in love!  I'm having more fun learning my rolls, and finger picking, than I have in what feels like a long time of playing guitar. So excited to really learn how to play this thing and spend my days pickin' away!  So yeah, just wanted to show off my first Banjo, and get any advice/feedback from the community!"

Also, the brackets that connect the hooks tend to dig into the laminate wood pot. Go easy on tightening those too. All in all its a good starter banjo. Keep practicing those licks. Cheers"

Also if memory serves me well that particular epiphone model has a really plunky low end sound that can get muddy. I'd recommend putting a damper in the back. Right where the rod runs through the tone ring in the back, you can stick a bit of cloth or a sponge or something of the sort to dampen certain tones and get the right brightness or plunk. Have fun."

banjo,394ibu,_stonecoldsaidso,6,Tue Jun 9 13:34:41 2015 UTC,"I hate those times. They can seem to go on for a lifetime. My personal belief is that they are a vital part of the learning process, and they are always followed by a huge burst of advancement.  Some of the ways to get through them:  1) Brute force: Take a complicated or challenging piece and simply work on it. Set a specific amount of time every day to work on it. It will be like work for a chunk of it. But eventually something will click.  2) Change of pace. Learn something completely outside your element or interest or comfort zone. It doesn't matter how silly or useless you think it is.  3) Rediscover. Go back to what initially got you interested in banjo. Study it with your new found knowledge. Sometimes you can see something you missed when you were just learning. That can sometimes cause a breakout.  4) Keep trying to find someone to play with. Doesn't matter what level they are at. Doesn't matter what instrument they play. Go to some open mics. Go to some jams.   Seriously, good luck. If there is anything I can help you with, any sort of playing or concept you may want to know, I'll certainly try to help you (can't guarantee I'll know it, but I'll do my best)."
banjo,394ibu,banjoman74,2,Tue Jun 9 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"You put that well. I think it's a pretty universal issue when you don't have a lot of people to play with. You get stuck in your own head and repertoire and go stagnant. I get by by taking a break from banjo and going to a different instrument or totally changing the genre of music I'm playing. In the end, when I come back to banjo and oldtime/bluegrass I'm renewed and have a lot of new things to try."

banjo,38y9rm,UncleEck,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'm just going off of everything I've read. Most sources I've found have said that the Plectrum banjo is a 4-string banjo with standard scale length (22 fret), a Tenor banjo is a 4-string banjo with a shorter scale length (19 fret), and an Irish Tenor is a 4-string banjo with an even shorter scale length (17 fret).   Looking at the Deering site, they just say 17-fret tenor rather than saying Irish Tenor, so maybe I'll start doing that. It's more specific anyway, and avoids using any cultural references which seem to cause heartburn in a lot of circles.  In any case, knowing how many frets OPs banjo has will help a lot with identification and playing suggestions."
banjo,38y9rm,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"The distinction between plectrum and tenor banjos is pretty clear, but for some reason people on the internet keep repeating this myth about the ""irish tenor banjo"". People often see earlier short-scale (~19-21'') tenors with 17 frets to the pot as ""irish tenors"", when in reality a lot of Irish Traditional Music banjo players prefer 19 fret 23'' scale tenors like Epiphone Recording models."
banjo,38y9rm,UncleEck,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"Just recently I was reading, and I don't remember where, an argument that 19-frets are better for Irish music because they let you resolve a progression in the key of F. Without the last fret, you can't do that so you're always stuck on the 4th and then have to resolve back down to the root rather than playing the root an octave up. If you get what I'm saying. That's what the comment said, I've never played a tenor banjo so I don't really know."

(In general, if you're looking for the melody of a non-banjo song, just head over to ultimate guitar and look at their tabs. Plenty of good stuff, and all you have to keep in mind is that you'll have to play any notes played on the guitar's E string two frets higher on your D string). I don't have access to my banjo right now, but otherwise I'd try to turn it into rolls. If you're new to the banjo, just look up a banjo fretboard with the notes labeled to start translating the guitar tab into a more banjo-friendly playing format."

And his craftsmanship is at a level that is VERY difficult to beat. I love his work. I LOVE his banjos. And this banjo is fantastic. In my opinion, you have to get into the $3,500 range or higher to beat this banjo. It is one of the few banjos that I would buy sight unseen.  EDIT: The other banjo I would think about seriously is the Nechville Flex-tone. Only recently was I aware that Tom Nechville was making banjos in this range (most fall into the above $3,500). Tom is innovative and his craftsmanship is incredible. I have never played this banjo (but I have played a quite a few Nechvilles). And Nechville banjos have a unique sound, which may fit you VERY well or not at all. But this banjo would definitely be worth checking out."

banjo,38jebf,banjoman74,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:18:04 2015 UTC,"One of the things I love on the Cimmaron (and any banjo) is a satin finish on the neck. I find a gloss finish too sticky. Furthermore, on the neck, I find it just the right size. Some of the Japanese masterclones had a neck on the chunky side (I'm thinking Gold Tones are a little chunkier as well, but that might just be my memory). And some other necks are a little too flat and thin (I'm looking at you Stelling).  As for sound... so much of that is set up. But in general, a Bishline is a little more even in tone. Stelling has that high end. I always think of Huber as having more of the bottom end.   Ode banjos and Deering banjos I always think of as lacking a bit of the punch. Great tone, but losing a bit on the power.  I find Nechville's to be a completely different beast. Their heli-mount system makes a tighter banjo all the way around. It gets rid of some of the overtones and provides a more purer tone. But the Flex-Tone doesn't have the Heli-Mount system. I would be willing to bet that the Flex-Tone and a Bishline will be a similar banjo.  These are all my opinions, and opinions on banjos will definitely vary."
banjo,38jebf,UncleEck,2,Thu Jun 4 19:42:10 2015 UTC,Did you mean Ome or were you referring to the old-school Odes? Both companies made a variety of banjos in terms of design and the resulting tone.
banjo,38jebf,banjoman74,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant Omes. Bit of a brain fart. You're right, Odes varied so much as they went through various ownerships and designs, it's difficult to pinpoint a tone on them. And I was thinking more of the Ome Juggernauts. I always think of them as very similar in tone to most Deerings. Though Deerings vary in tone as well. A Hartford is very different from a Golden Era.  That being said, every banjo varies in tone from one another, even the same model. I've heard archtops peel paint, and ones that wouldn't hurt a fly. I've heard Gibson banjos, including prewars, that were flat. And I've heard an amazing 1970s Gibson (still can't figure that one out). Once you get past that $2,000 range, so much of it is the player and the set up.  I do have a soft spot in my heart for Odes though, due to their history and connection to my banjo teacher, Jake Peters, and Bobby Thompson."
banjo,38jebf,nikabrik,2,Thu Jun 4 20:02:13 2015 UTC,"Would you not recommend a Gold Star? I have a GF85 (which I believe is just a less pretty 100?) and I love it :) Mine has a few upgrades on the tuners etc but its really great and only cost me Â£500 (I'm in the UK) something-hand. :)   I'm not sure if its totally 'professional' but Tom Adams plays one, and he's a professional ;)"
banjo,38jebf,banjoman74,2,Thu Jun 4 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"Gold Star banjos have a wonderful history. And Saga, in my opinion, does a great job of making instruments. Their Blueridge guitars are incredible for the price.  Definitely Gold Stars are an option if you're looking for that $1,000 to $1,500 range. As I said, I'm a fan of the satin finish, so I tend towards the Recording King banjos in that range. But there is NOTHING wrong with a properly set up Gold Star.   It's important to note though that Tom's Gold Star is a little different breed from the current Gold Stars being made. One of the lesser-known coveted banjos out there is an early JD Crowe Gold Star banjo. They're pretty rare, but beautiful instruments, and would be a similar quality to Tom Adams.   For those who may not know, Tom's a monster who now suffers from focal dystonia (where there is a disconnect in regards to nerve endings from brain to fingers). Here's Tom Adams playing his famous Gold Star. He played with The Johnson Mountain Boys, but his work with James King on the album Lonesome and Then Some is a must have, as well as his solo album Right Hand Man"

banjo,38jebf,UncleEck,2,Fri Jun 5 04:15:54 2015 UTC,"Omes and Odes are all pretty nice instruments. As a primarily old time player who does a lot of up-picking, the silverspun tone ring Ome banjos with a resonator hit kind of a sweet spot for me in terms of power and tone. Incredible fit and finish to boot. I've got a bluegrasser buddy who swears by his '70s Ode style D, and its a pretty fancy-looking thing with all the gold plating.   I'm sort of in the mindset where a major part of tone (aside from the player's touch) is down to set up. Some people discount the impact that little changes can make on the tone, for example how much downforce your tailpiece is applying behind the bridge."

banjo,38inwy,abowlofcereal,5,Thu Jun 4 13:52:48 2015 UTC,"In short: you need to put the bridge back to where it was.  The bridge is placed in a very precise position that allows the intonation of the notes on the fretboard to be just right.   To do so (for a complete beginner):   1) Learn what a harmonic is.  2) Produce a harmonic at the 12th fret on one of the DGBD strings   3) Fret the 12th on the same string. The note you get should be the same as the harmonic played in step 2. If it is not - move the bridge.  4) I do this by trial and error, but you can work it out quickly with a banjo with a quick experiment moving the bridge. If the harmonic is sharper than the note - move the bridge one way , and if the harmonic is flatter move the bridge the other way.  Move the bridge until the harmonic and the fretted 12th fret are the same.  5) Do the same for the 12th fret of the other three DGBD strings and the 17th fret/harmonic of the high drone string, and your bridge should be good to go.  6) Usually after getting the first string right the other 4 are pretty bang on  Hope that helps and that should get rid of those vibrations."
banjo,38inwy,GuinnessBeer,2,Thu Jun 4 14:36:11 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. Also note that you may need to form a slight ""tilt"" in the bridge. In other words Your bridge doesn't necessarily have to be perfectly perpendicular to the strings to get your best sounds. Go string for string. This is tedious and causes a lot of back and forth, but when you find the goldilocks zone it's all worth it."

banjo,38inwy,UncleEck,3,Thu Jun 4 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"You can do this accurately and easily with an electronic tuner, open string and 12th fret should be the same note.  Just keep moving the bridge until it's in the right place."

And honestly, that's my goal. I want them to get to the point where they can stop paying me and learn on their own.  I tend to have people under the age of 18 or over the age of 50. I don't have tonnes of students, but I usually have two students going at a time. They last a couple years. Typically it just happens that people get busy and it becomes harder to consistently meet up. Sometimes they move away. Likely they are happy with the level that they are at playing or they feel I'm not teaching them anything of significance.   I would say two years is a pretty consistent number for me."
banjo,38ezdy,AveragePurpleWizard,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I would hope. In several weeks of one session/week I got him up to ""8 more miles till Louisville"" and  ""Bury me beneath the willow"" we then ventured into ""Ol' Joe Clark"" and he just gave it up. It was kind of disheartening as he is my first student. And believe it or not, there are very few banjo players around here. In Kentucky... I feel that I need to pass the flame onto someone else."
banjo,38ezdy,AveragePurpleWizard,3,Thu Jun 4 13:00:00 2015 UTC,"I have a banjo student and a ukulele student right now. The banjo student has been with me for about 9 months, he was my first student. I had another banjo student who only had one lesson, a woman who I only taught uke to for a few lessons, a guy who was playing uke but bought a banjo and had a few banjo lessons before quitting. My ukulele guy at the moment I've had since january. The ones who have stayed are the ones with no experience. Perhaps I am a terrible teacher. All of my students except the banjo guy who stayed for one lesson have been ~50 or over."
banjo,38ezdy,AveragePurpleWizard,3,Wed Jun 3 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"That's my fear. I taught him 3 songs and he just gave it up. I understand it's not for everyone, but I just want to spread the banjoy."
banjo,38ezdy,a_dapperdanman,2,Thu Jun 4 13:01:07 2015 UTC,I think the problem for some people is that they find it hard (which everyone does) so they think they'll never be able to do it and just give up. Or they don't understand that changing chords over and over again is absolutely going to boring after a while but is necessary if you want to have fun and play well. So I try my best to hammer those facts in. Did he say why he gave up?
banjo,38ezdy,TakeItFromJoe,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:15:41 2015 UTC,"Said that he just didn't practice as much as he should. Which I could tell by the repeating issues that didn't progress. He got pretty good at the first to songs we learned though. It's a shame. He had potential.  And yes, I was pretty open about how practice would look. Heck, I'd spend hours doing a forward-backward roll just alternating random chords to practice when I first started. Or the agonizing period in a new song when you creep along the melody when you just want to fly like Scruggs. I think he just lost interest."
banjo,38ezdy,a_dapperdanman,2,Thu Jun 4 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"Ah well. I think some people just can't stick with it. I never used to practice when I had guitar lessons (for years). Once I stopped, I liked it. I wish you luck with the next student."

banjo,38f97m,dr_w,4,Wed Jun 3 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"Here's a bit of a ramble.  Anytime you make a jump up to another banjo, assume you're going to lose between $100 and $200 on the resale of your banjo. This, of course, is not always the case, but it's a good rule of thumb.  So, on a $200 banjo, don't ever expect to get your money back from that purchase. That banjo is on the cheaper end and is sometimes difficult to resell. It will likely be a beater for the rest of your life, or you will sell it for $50 or lend it to a friend wanting ot play, and you'll never see it again.  An upgrade to a $500 banjo (or less) is sometimes not a big enough jump from a $200 banjo. One, you're going to lose another ~$200 when you want to upgrade again (which could potentially bring the total between $200 and $400 that you are out, in total).   And there can be a HUGE difference between a $400 and a banjo just under $1,000. Tone ring, tuners, and quality of parts on a higher end Gold Tone, RK 35 or even a good used banjo in the $800 range is absolutely incredible from a $500 banjo (unless you are able to find a really good deal).  In my opinion, to upgrade significantly from an RK35, you have to get into the $2,000 range (and my recommendation is typically a Bishline Cimmaron).  In short, my recommendation is to save a little extra and upgrade to the RK35. In the long run, it will save you money.   TL;DR Limit the number of times you upgrade your banjo because you can expect to lose $200 everytime you upgrade."
banjo,38f97m,banjoman74,2,Thu Jun 4 16:59:25 2015 UTC,This post really nails it. Good stuff to think about for all those potential upgraders.
banjo,38f97m,UncleEck,3,Thu Jun 4 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"The Rk's are nice. If there's nothing wrong with your current banjo though, I'd hold out for the 35. The RK-R25 is nice, but the 35 is a whole nother level. It's not just about volume. A tone ring changes the whole sound of the instrument."

banjo,383vyc,banjoman74,3,Mon Jun 1 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"Some additional information. Pete Wernick was on the plane with his family. When Pete unbuckled himself after the crash, he fell to the ""ceiling"" as the plane was upside down.  The banjo he was travelling with was a 1988 Granada. It came out of its case during the crash and skidded on the tarmac on the back. If I remember correctly, the neck broke. Pete got a new neck from Gibson on it (with gull inlays, similar to his famous RB-1).   He tried putting another resonator on it, but he didn't like the sound. So he put the road-rash broken resonator back on.   The accident happened on a Wednesday, and Pete played that weekend.  Here is video of him playing July 21, 1989 at Winterhawk Bluegrass Festival, two days after surviving a plane crash."
banjo,383vyc,BackToTheBasic,4,Mon Jun 1 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Here is video of him playing July 21, 1989, two days after surviving a plane crash.   That's intense.  I don't think my hands would be steady enough yet for that."
banjo,383vyc,TakeItToTheMax,4,Mon Jun 1 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"He had an interesting reaction to the crash. This is from an interview in 1997   I learned that you don't know when you could die. You could die driving home from here. I could die of a heart attack right now... The randomness of who died and who didn't die was a very hard fact to ponder. Some people said, 'You didn't die. Somebody up there must have wanted to keep you alive.' But I find that very insulting to the peole who did die. Does that mean somebody didn't want to keep those people alive? People who died were fathers, mothers, children. I learned that everybody is needed and valued by somebody and to me, if anything, after the plane crash I wondered how could a loving God allow that to happen. To me, that's the proof that there isn't any loving God.   He also said this (paraphrased)   Wernick realized that the crash affected his music, at least in one respect: If he finds himself onstage playing too conservatively, he reminds himself he could die tomorrow.If it's to be his last concert, he wants it packed with innovation and risk, not hedged bets.    Finally, here's a song he wrote of the experience titled A DAY IN 89 (YOU NEVER KNOW)  I can't imagine being on stage though two days after that."
banjo,383vyc,snot_lube,2,Mon Jun 1 18:30:04 2015 UTC,"Wow. And also, reading those quotes and seeing people clap for his survival, he probably hated it. He probably abhorred the fact people applauded his ability to walk away from the crash."
banjo,383vyc,froggsleggs,2,Mon Jun 1 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine the ""survivor's guilt."" Plus, every inteview and conversation would have some question of surviving the plane crash."

Just use the right size wrench, not pliers. Take the resonator off, carefully saving all the hardware.  Now, carefully loosen the nuts holding the neck to the pot.  Move the neck so that the strings don't buzz but are close enough to the frets so that playing is easy. Tighten the bolts, put the resonator back on, tune it.  Simple. Now, practise until you're a banjo hero.  Any questions?  Lots of info on the Web."

banjo,38028y,Rebuhl,3,Mon Jun 1 00:07:02 2015 UTC,Try adjusting the dynamics for a more musical feel. Start playing softly and quietly. Figure out the notes that feel like they should be loud. Gradually play harder and louder up to them and gradually play softer after them. Try and play like a sine wave instead of a square wave (if that makes sense).  Sounds good though.

banjo,37pqye,aeropagitica,2,Fri May 29 12:56:35 2015 UTC,"Not so sure of what you mean by ""Classic"". Many of those are songs derived from 19th Century blackface minstrelsy. You could think of these songs as ""folk music"", but it might be more accurate to look at them as 19th Century pop music. Camptown Races and Oh Susanna were written by Stephen Foster, a writer who came out of the blackface tradition and is often touted as ""America's first great songwriter"". I guess most of these survive as kids songs or campfire songs, though several of them were recorded by string bands in the '20s and '30s.   If I were suggest more songs in this vein, I'd say: - Arkansas Traveller - Turkey In The Straw - Bile Them Cabbage Down - Dixie - Jordan Is A Hard Road To Travel - Year Of Jubilo"

One this that I've found to help me out is to stop looking at tabs and learn to find the songs myself. A good starting place is a song like ""I'll Fly Away"". Once you figure a couple out, the intuitiveness of the banjo really shines. Listen to some old folk tunes by folks like Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and the Carter Family and find a few songs that sound simple enough to work with.   Some other suggestions for songs:  ""I'll fly away""  ""You are my sunshine""  ""I ain't got no home""  ""Blowin down that old dusty road"""

The Fender will probably be ok if you want a resonator banjo. An Epiphone MB-200 is an option too. Since you mentioned that he likes folk music, consider getting him an open-back banjo. The Recording King Dirty 30s RKH-05 open-back is a nice banjo and should be in your price range. Open-backs are a bit less expensive so you can get a better quality instrument for that price."

banjo,37oc1p,theredball,1 point,Fri May 29 06:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'm worried he might not be into the open back ones. How much does the open back differ in volume and tone compared to a resonator?

banjo,37oc1p,homer858,2,Fri May 29 06:50:33 2015 UTC,"Open backs have a warmer tone than resonator banjos. Resonators are louder and brighter, generally, than open backs. The Dirty Thirties is well built and will have a nice warm tone."

banjo,37oc1p,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Fri May 29 06:56:40 2015 UTC,I think he'd be willing to overlook a minor cosmetic issue for the fact that you got him an instrument of decent quality to learn and play on.

banjo,37oc1p,take_my_waking_slow,3,Fri May 29 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"It's also a way to not get stuck in a price range.  $200 is a very generous gift but in terms of new banjos it's barely enough to get the cheapest instruments.  $300-$450 is probably more realistic.  He may also want to learn about banjo playing styles before he buys an instrument, because people tend to be drawn to one or the other (clawhammer vs 3-finger), the sound is different, and people tend to want instruments that fit the sound they're looking for (open-back vs resonator).  Anyway, when my wife offers to put money towards a new instrument of my choice it's like the best birthday gift ever."

banjo,37ibde,BanjoCAB,5,Wed May 27 22:08:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Banjo Dave was originally a guitar player, so he came at it from the same direction it sounds like you are. I think in the end it all depends on the sounds you want to create."
banjo,37ibde,Adddicus,3,Thu May 28 01:09:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, one other bit, there used to be a Russian girl on the Banjo Hangout (she might still be there, but I rarely visit the site anymore), who played a six string banjo (tuned and strung as a guitar), but she played bluegrass on it. And she could flawlessly reproduce all the classic banjo lead lines, licks and backup playing. How she did it, I don't know, but she was goooood."

banjo,37ibde,banjo_lake,3,Thu May 28 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat for about the first 3 years or so of playing banjo. Outside of flat picking I just couldn't pick with more than two fingers to save my life! And yes I did get some flack for it. Not a lot, but enough to make me self conscious when playing in front of other banjo folks. I even took a set of lessons to try and get it going to no avail. However one guy told me to just try three fingers at least 10 minutes per day. Tried and tried and tried and I just couldn't get it. But then one day...BAM!! I could do it! As if I had been doing it all along!  All that being said, I still have songs that I can only play with a flat pick to this day, and I feel like it just makes them that much more special!  Don't let anyone get you down! Play what you want, how you want, and love every minute of it!"

banjo,37ibde,MyLittleFedora,1 point,Thu May 28 13:49:22 2015 UTC,I don't see why people who flatpick 5 strings don't just use a tenor or plectrum banjo. Is there any benefit whatsoever? Surely the fifth string is just massively superfluous and gets in the way?

banjo,37jeu1,UncleEck,2,Thu May 28 14:09:28 2015 UTC,Why not? What should I be looking for?
banjo,37fiba,d_rudy,3,Wed May 27 06:33:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of times chords sounding out of tune can be due to improper finger pressure and placement, but if it started after you dropped it, there are two big possibilities.  One - Your neck is bent. You can probably tell by looking straight down it. This is usually the result of storing the banjo improperly, but I guess it falling could have a similar effect. My hunch is this is not your problem.  Two (and the thing you should check first) - Your bridge shifted. Remeasure and make sure it's in the right place. If the distance of the strings is wrong, fretting them will sound very out of tune.  I'm sure there are other possible problems, but that's what comes to mind first."
banjo,37fiba,nonneb,3,Wed May 27 07:13:30 2015 UTC,"+1 for bridge placement - first instrument-related problem I thought of as it is the most fragile area of adjustment that could be knocked out.  Also +1 for finger pressure - the actual first thing I thought of all together. If you're completely sure your fretting was 100% before the incident you can rule this out, but fretting even a tiny bit too hard or pushing the strings even slightly to one side will make the notes sharper, and by varying degrees."
banjo,37fiba,EMarkM_DM,2,Wed May 27 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely check the bridge. When it moves - a quarter inch is a lot - it'll tune open, be out of tune fretted - and progressively more so as you go up the neck.   It's easy to tell: on any string pluck it open, then while fretted at the 12th fret (there is usually some inlay or dots there). They should be the same note, an octave apart. If your ear isn't sure use an electronic tuner. Check all the strings.  If not the same, slide the bridge up (toward the pegs) or down (toward the tailpiece). If the fretted note was higher (ignoring the octave difference), move the bridge up. If the fretted note is lower move it down.  You move it by grasping each end with a pinch, and firmly shoving it along the head. You want to avoid letting it fall flat (easy to pick up though).  Then check the strings again. You'll have to just get a feel for the right distance to shove it each time. Sometimes 1/16"" at a time is sufficient. If way off move it further. It takes a few tries.   The bridge should end up roughly level across, but because of slight differences with each string it might end up just slightly angled.  Also, you'll find that one or two strings never get perfect - that's because those small differences never line up perfectly. That's ok, just get most of them spot on.  When done, retune the instrument and do a final check of the bridge. You might need to readjust slightly, since tuning can shift things a tiny bit.   You can get compensated or curved bridges bridges. They are helpful but even those are a compromise between ideal and reality.   When adjusted, use a pencil to draw a light line along the tailpiece side of the bridge (there may be one already) - this gives you a guide for quick placement later if it should move again or you take it off to change strings. Note that this line will always be approximate; the precise location will shift over time as the strings age or change.  Checking the bridge occasionally is a good idea - my banjo will start to sound a little off and hard to tune. Adjusting the bridge even a hair will really help."

banjo,370t51,OldFrets,3,Sat May 23 20:21:25 2015 UTC,"There aren't a whole lot of 4-stringers on this sub, so I thought I'd post some.  A few years ago I began picking up the tenor banjo as a way to fingerpick in mandolin or mandola tuning. Later I picked up a plectrum and tuned it as an octave mandolin, which expanded the range of notes and tones available to me.  I enjoy collecting obscure vintage instruments and researching them, and now my banjo collection is starting to catch up to my guitars, steels and mandolins. While there's theoretically some redundancy, I've specifically acquired four banjos that sound and play very differently:   My Bacon Special Grand Concert tenor has an extra-short 20"" scale, an open back and Bacon's internal resonator with f-holes in the back. As you'd expect, it has a warm, deep sound with less volume than the others. Chording and picking is a breeze, and it's also quite a bit lighter than my other banjos. My Leedy Amphion plectrum weighs a ton but has a sound to match. It's loud and clear, with warm low notes but the clarity that comes from a full 27"" scale. In keeping with the norms of 1920s banjo decoration, the gold sparkle plastic, gold-plated hardware and natural brass rim make for a startling visual clash. My Dopera Original plectrum was built by the Dopyera Brothers, the folks who started the original National and Dobro guitar companies, in 1968 after National went bankrupt. Much like their resonator guitars, the banjo sports an engraved metal resonator (anodized aluminum, in this case). It has a dry, crisp sound and plays very easily due to the short 26"" scale. My Vega Moderne tenor is a fairly rare model that was only made for a couple of years in the early 1930s. The headstock and fret markers have carved patterns that were then filled with ink (and paint on the headstock). This was Vega's attempt to make a high-end banjo at a mid-range price, and I'd say they succeeded well. I like to tell people that the resonator was lifted out of a parquet floor."

banjo,36s949,banjoman74,3,Fri May 22 05:22:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's a strange one that I used to own.  I've heard it called a TB-X. But typically, TB-Xs are these strange banjos with a black and white resonator and strange holes in the tone ring.  I've only ever heard of two other banjos like this (photos on Greg Earnest's site), and they were gold plated. One was a five-string and one was a four string. It has a 12-inch pot. I never did figure out if someone had replated it nickel from being gold (which would be really strange) or it had always been nickel plated. There were other strange things about this banjo.   One is the resonator, which was carved out and flat... kind of like the top tensions, only really different. The back of the resonator had round edges (no binding) and a beautiful sunburst.   Here's a close up of the arch top tone ring.   Most interesting... and now I'm kicking myself because I didn't take a photo of it, is that the clamshell tailpiece had slots for five strings. Which is really strange, because the clam shell on the five-string banjos only had slots for four strings, if I remember correctly.  And here's a close up of the headstock  This banjo would have been made around 1933 I think. I owned it for a little bit, then ended up selling it to Jim Mills, as I think he's a good historian to own it (plus, the money was useful). I remember watching a video of his shop and seeing that banjo on a stand, which I thought was pretty cool."

Different people use different methods to check the tension. Some will tap tune, some use a drum tension dial, some just go by feel. In general, a G# is about right for pitch. An easy method is to get it roughly in the ball park and then get the strings and bridge on. If you take a 10"" ruler and place it across the head, parallel to the strings, next to one of the bridge feet. You want about enough space for a quarter to fit between the ruler and head at the point of most deflection."

banjo,36mpi9,tametrees,19,Wed May 20 14:48:25 2015 UTC,"No problem, they're common on most stringed instruments. They give you a quick reference for which fret you're on. That's why they're also on the top edge of the fret board. One quick glance and BAM you're at the 5th fret, or 7th, or 12th, or whatever. Long story short it makes moving up/down the frets easier and quicker."
banjo,36mpi9,Godzillaaaaa,17,Wed May 20 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"Also, the two dots are the 12th fret. They are supposed to be exactly an octave higher (same note just higher) than hitting the open strings.  If they are not the same, you have to make sure the distance between your nut, the 12th fret, and the floating bridge are all the same. (Sorry if that sounds complicated, but it's important.) I'm a dummy, and thought my banjo was just a POS for about a year until someone told me that. If your floating bridge is not in the correct place, all of your notes will be out of tune and it'll sound real bad."
banjo,36mpi9,baconbomb138,9,Wed May 20 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"And here's some more nerd stuff.  As you mentioned, the marking at the twelfth fret is half the distance from nut to bridge.  Take the twelfth fret to the nut and half that distance (1/4)... that's the fifth fret (where another marker is). This is also why the harmonics at the fifth fret are an octave higher than the harmonics at the twelfth fret.  Okay, now take the distance from the bridge to nut and split it into thirds. The first third is the seventh fret (which also has harmonics). The next third is the 21st fret (which also typically has a marker). And that harmonic is the same as the seventh fret.  Take the distance from the seventh fret (one-third of the distance from nut to bridge) and halve that (which is now 1/6 of the entire length from nut to bridge). That is the third fret.  The last marker is at the tenth fret. That is one-sixth of string length from the fifth fret (which is 1/4). So 1/4 plus 1/6 is 5/12.   So the markers are, in order: 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 5/12, 1/2. Then the markers repeat at the twefth fret (three frets from the twelfth, 7 frets from the twelfth, 10 frets from the twelfth). So if you're a math nerd, there should never be a fret marker at the first fret.  And that's how they determined where the fret markers are."
banjo,36mpi9,banjoman74,5,Wed May 20 16:40:05 2015 UTC,If only the ratios were actually that simple in equal temperament.
banjo,36mpi9,UncleEck,1 point,Wed May 20 17:24:08 2015 UTC,I always think that fiddle and mandolin are the ideal instruments to begin on simply due to the string intervals making much more sense than guitar and banjo.
banjo,36mpi9,banjoman74,3,Wed May 20 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"Totally different issue. Fret placement isn't actually based on the ratios you mentioned. Those work fine when all strings are open, but as soon as you put on a capo it all falls apart. That's why modern fretted instrument by and large use an equal temperament system. Instead of using simple fractional ratios that are harmonically true, it's a logarithmic series that is continuous from any point on the board. This means that the 5th fret isn't quite 1/4 of the scale length, but pretty close. This means everything is slightly out of tune, but equally so everywhere."
banjo,36mpi9,homer858,1 point,Wed May 20 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"But it's worse when the instrument is tuned in fourths rather than fifths, no?  I know that's why they have those strange fanned frets and staggered frets. Or am I still misunderstanding?"
banjo,36mpi9,banjoman74,3,Wed May 20 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"You're partially correct.  First, fan frets and staggered frets are done for different but related reasons of intonation. The main motive for fanned frets comes from the issue of string stiffness. More specifically, as a general rule the larger a string the stiffer it is. The stiffer a string is, the more pressure it will take to push it to the fret. The more pressure it takes to move it to the fret, and the more the deflection of the string will affect the pitch of the string. Paired with this, the shorter a string is, the larger the deflection will be compared to the total string length.  The point of all this is that big strings don't work well with short scale lengths. Fanned frets make the bass strings longer than the treble. The idea is that you can use smaller strings for the bass notes and they will sound better and play more in tune. You can also use tunings that have a larger range without as much of a compromise for the quality of each string. This is an artifact of the strings, not the way we calculate fret positions.  Staggered frets kinda what you're thinking. They use a natural temperament system that supposedly compensates for each note, correcting it to be closer to a harmonically true. The issues are when you start changing keys and tunings and capoing. Not so hot then."
banjo,36mpi9,homer858,1 point,Wed May 20 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"No, mandolins and tenor guitars are also generally fretted according to equal temperament ratios. Violin family instruments are sort of another story because the lack of frets allows for subtlety altering the intervals."
banjo,36mpi9,UncleEck,1 point,Wed May 20 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"Also, 12 tone equal temperament has more to do with the intervals sounding good in all keys. It is impossible to tune a twelve-tone chromatic scale so that all intervals are ""perfect"". For example, three justly tuned major thirds don't stack up to a proper octave."

banjo,36mpi9,baconbomb138,1 point,Wed May 20 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"I imagine it's a pretty common thing among new banjo players, or any instrument without a set bridge. I had been playing guitar for a while prior and didn't even think of it.  As far as the strings going out of tune, I had this issue at first as well , especially on the high string.  I found that I had to tighten the screw of the tuning key to get it to sit still. (There should be a phillip's screw on the outside of the key) It was kind of loose when I got it and would wind back down pretty quickly."

banjo,36mpi9,Critter2g0,2,Wed May 20 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"There is some discussion about the significance of different frets above in the other comments.. but I mean you can work with those fret ratios without having dots on your instruments and design music without looking at the frets. What I mean is, they absolutely do not have to be there, you can even buy fret boards without them if you really wanted to. I think the most useful application of the dots is that they're spaced out nicely and visible so that you can play and learn to play easily and quickly. Where they actually chose to place them most likely started out on significant fret ratios and then ended up with the modern day design that you see on most stringed instruments."

Which doesn't even make sense because the banjo has violin pegs and loosen up pretty much constantly, and yet the strings still snapped without even being played.   Side note: Damn, apparently someone doesn't like what I said. I don't think I've ever seen downvotes like that in /r/banjo."
banjo,36itbs,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Wed May 20 11:28:41 2015 UTC,Yeah this sub can be a bit divided at times I notice. That's a bummer on the Reds though. I'm still going to give them a try as they're not exactly expensive. It seems to be all about minimizing any pinching spots with them.
banjo,36itbs,UncleEck,1 point,Wed May 20 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"It seems to be all about minimizing any pinching spots with them.    That's a part of it for sure. The other thing I've read is that you have to stretch them over the course of weeks before they settle in. I called suppliers when I was having the problems, and one described the string material as ""similar to taffy"". As in it will stretch a little bit at a time, but if you try to stretch them too much they will snap very easily.   Personally, I think that waiting weeks to months to stretch strings is simply unacceptable, so I won't be buying them again."

The trajectory of the culture surrounding the banjo, the styles in which it is played, and the showmanship and intrinsic humor of the banjoist all can be traced back to minstrel shows of the 19th century."

Might be something good to practice my luthier skills on, I've been wanting a fretless.  EDIT: A review from Amazon:   This banjo came to me with a huge ding in it and in addition to that it was scratched up, regardless of the fact that it was supposedly new. The banjo itself was of poor craftsmanship and the tuner knobs could not hold the strings in tune. It also , much like the other review states, does not match the box or picture. It does NOT come with the arm rest. The packaging also had a washer rogue washer and other metal scraps floating around in it. Due to the other users experience Im not even going to mess around with trying to replace it, Im just going to return it and get a different brand. I don't normally write product reviews, but this one was so bad I just don't want anyone else to waste their time or money. This banjo is garbage, it may seem like a sweet deal but its really just a waste of your time. Expect to have to return it several times before you get one thats actually almost acceptable.

banjo,36etxj,DarumaRed,2,Mon May 18 23:06:29 2015 UTC,"Wait until you know what you want. There is no one banjo designed for clawhammer because there is not one unified clawhammer style. Besides finish and scoop, anything below 1k will be about the same. If you really want a scoop, sell your current goodtime and get one with a scoop. There are some things in that price range, but I'd wait until you can afford a few hundred more as you'll get into the territory of serious instruments. 1200 gets you into the range of a Bart Reiter or Kevin Enoch. 1400 and you're looking at more tone ring options."

Between 500 and 1100 is really an awkward spot in banjoland. Anything above 500, with a few exceptions, you end up paying mostly for bling on a factory made instrument as the real upgrades cost more.   If you're willing to go used or dinged here are some options:  http://www.banjobuyer.com/banjo/48977 It's a great banjo and is being sold by the maker at a discout due to a minor visual blemish.   Another nice option a bit above your range; similar to the Enoch in some ways: http://www.banjobuyer.com/banjo/51395  I see you're a welder. If you're confident with your crafting skills, another option would be to put your own instrument together. You can buy most parts online and assembly is easy.

banjo,367czg,Louiecat,2,Sat May 16 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not really one for tabbing things out, but it looks like he's playing it in the key of D-minor out standard G tuning. He's using the fourth string to have a D pedal point in the bass while he fingers the melody inside of three string closed positions up and down the neck."
banjo,367czg,UncleEck,1 point,Sun May 17 03:06:26 2015 UTC,"That's some good advice. I'm less interested in tabbing it out than just being able to figure out how to play it. I have a bunch of questions though as it seems you are much more experienced in this than me.   What's a D pedal point? The Bassline in the song based on the piano video shows it to be an F. Are you saying he changed that to a D to fit the standard G tuning?   So as a strategy for figuring this song out, I should: highlight all of the notes in D-minor on the fretboard, figure out the best fret in the first second and third strings to play the melody (watching the video to see what might work best), and not worry as much about getting the bass and harmony right? It seems like the chords he uses goes higher and lower depending on where he is at in the melody, which is not what is done on the standard piano version."
banjo,367czg,UncleEck,2,Sun May 17 03:18:31 2015 UTC,"He seems to have transposed down three semitones from the original key of F-minor to the new key of D-minor. By pedal point I mean that there is kind of a continuous drone of that low D on the fourth string throughout much of the piece, but the bass note does shift when he moves to the G-minor voicing. The melody of this piece also contains an augmented fourth, in this case G#, that provides some of the cool dissonance and tension."
banjo,367czg,UncleEck,1 point,Sun May 17 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"Wow that makes so much sense. Bringing it down 3 semitones makes it possible to play that drone note without fretting it (which is something I was convinced as the only possibility, so I was considering retuning the 4th string, I hadn't thought to change the key). This fixes a lot of problems.   What is this G-minor voicing you're talking about?    And by augmented fourth do you mean that instead of F-minor being "" F, G, Aâ­, Bâ­, C, Dâ­, and Eâ­"" it is instead "" F, G, Aâ­, G#, C, Dâ­, and Eâ­""? But isn't Aâ­ the same as G#? I guess I don't yet fully understand the difference between a sharp and flat that is the same tonal frequency.   I think it's really astounding you are able to gather all of this by ear like that. I've only been playing a year and your ability to do this seems so out of reach for me -- although if I saw the things I can do today a year ago I wouldn't have believed it. I want to get to your level. How did you train your ear like that? This is what I love about playing an instrument... there's always something new to learn, there's always room for self-improvement."
banjo,367czg,UncleEck,2,Sun May 17 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry if my post was confusing. He's playing this piece in D-minor, so don't worry about the notes in the F-minor scale. D minor scale would be D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C. The melody also incorporates notes outside that scale, like the augmented fourth (G#). I'm mixing sharps and flat in the same scale here, which isn't always kosher but that's a more complicated thing to get into.   At about the 1:20 mark, he switches to the G voicing I was talking about. I said it was minor in my last post, but looking at it now I think its more of G5 hes fingering by getting the third fret on the second string and the fifth fret on the first string and plucking the open G note on the third string.    In terms of training your ear, it just takes time. I play a lot of old time music, country blues, and ragtime and never really took to learning off of sheet music or tab so it forced me to develop my ear through close listening. Slowing down recordings can be a big help. For me the fun in that approach can be the sort of ""reverse engineering"" aspect to figuring out what someone else is doing."
banjo,367czg,UncleEck,1 point,Sun May 17 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, no your post wasn't confusing at all. I was just tired and wrote out the wrong scale.  Whoops.   What is voicing? And how do you know it's G5? What makes it G5?    And is there anything else you think I should know in order to get this song right? You've been very helpful so far. Learning this song is my first step in ""reverse engineering"" I want to tackle gymnopedie after this and no one has seemed to do it before so I don't have anything to go off of.

The b30 is pretty much your run-of-the-mill aluminum-rimmed resonator banjo built in the same way as a countless number of cheap entry-level pacific rim banjos since the 70's. Some people call them bottlecaps because of the look of the one piece pot and flange. They're honestly not great, but with the right setup they can sound ok.   It seems like the general pattern with these bottlecap banjos is that people who start out on one end up seeking out a better banjo if they keep playing. That's not to say you can't get a decent sound out of one, it just takes some tweaking."

banjo,35yvup,OnGoProJo,1 point,Fri May 15 07:02:26 2015 UTC,"It depends, I guess. Some peoples line of thinking is that trying to learn on an instrument that you're struggling to make sound good is discouraging, so these banjos can end up turning off a new picker to the whole thing. These entry-level banjos are also hard to resell if you want to get rid of it. If you're willing to buy used, you could buy a slightly nicer instrument and sell it without significant loss if it doesn't work out for you. That's my strategy with these kinds of things.  On the other hand, maybe you drop a couple hundred on one of these, get someone who knows what they're doing to set it up decently and it'll meet your needs for the time being. If there's anywhere near you that you can play some banjos before you buy, that can be very valuable in determining whether you like the feel of this model. I remember the neck being kind of thin and uncomfortable on one I poked around on."
banjo,35yvup,UncleEck,1 point,Thu May 14 20:14:35 2015 UTC,"If you have the gumption to stick with it, I would say there are some definite advantages to buying the cheapest working banjo around (rogue b30 = perfect).  The tuning will be more difficult, but because of that your ear will improve.  No geared fifth tuning peg?  Figure out how to make it sound good without one, or how to install your own.  You'll be forced to tamper and upgrade piece by piece, experimenting with different bridges and tailpieces, making the instrument your own.    When the time comes to upgrade you'll be able to appreciate the upgraded instrument that much more.  The original will be resellable up to almost the $200, or even better lendable to friends who want to learn.  Being easier does not always mean better, and in many cases can have its disadvantages.    I bought my cheap Danville banjo from a pawn shop about a year ago, the first couple months I thought I had wasted my money and the instrument was defective.  Now I think I'm a way better musician all around, and I wouldn't have it any other way."

As I've progressed, I've learned to control my volume with my right-hand so I don't need the mute anymore.

Radiused or flat (although he does have a specific radius model, the flat works just fine from my experience)  -Handmade at his shop here in Utah! (i've met him several times)  -Very easy to use, and i feel like the banjo maintains a good tone with it on.

banjo,35xrbn,Reese_Wallace,1 point,Thu May 14 16:35:54 2015 UTC,I have and don't really like the gold tone mute. Doesn't really quiet the banjo as much as it should for the high cost. A t-shirt or rag stuffed in-between the coordinator rod/rods and the head directly under the bridge is way cheaper and much more effective.  Not super easy with resonator banjos but that's why I have an open back and a resonator. I practice with the muted open back and jam with the resonator.

banjo,35wmm6,a_dapperdanman,6,Thu May 14 03:05:01 2015 UTC,Take the resonator off and stick a shirt or a rag or two in it.  Mutes it quite a bit and sounds pretty nice for clawhammer!

banjo,35wmm6,jcrocket,2,Thu May 14 13:45:50 2015 UTC,Super easy and it's good to know how to do. Having a basic understanding of how your banjo is constructed is nice for making minor tweaks and repairs. Be fearless and watch youtube.
banjo,35wmm6,meem1029,4,Thu May 14 17:56:01 2015 UTC,It's really not very hard. Mine at least just has 4 screws that come out (actually maybe 4 mounting points with 2 screws per now that I think about it). It comes off super easy and then you just line it up (it has a gap for the neck so it's obvious which direction it goes) and screw it back in and all is good!

banjo,35wmm6,dukedog,1 point,Thu May 14 03:19:23 2015 UTC,It is usually just around 20 minute sessions. I think I know a few people who are living a few doors away so I might have them let me know if it is too loud. Sounds like I should be alright though.
banjo,35wmm6,morgensd,3,Thu May 14 03:26:07 2015 UTC,Learning to control your volume is a fundamental part of learning to play the banjo and absolutely required if you want to play with others. My advice is to practice playing quietly and learn to control your volume.

The sharp attack with a quick decay, as well as the higher-range of the instrument (and the individual string syncopation) allowed it to be one of the most easiest instruments to be picked up by the recording horns that you had to play into.  Other instruments with long sustain, or lack of that clear attack, or lower register, sounded quite muddy or were not picked up at all.   Most of the gramophones and other players at that time would come with a free recording. And many times that recording was a banjo recording, which greatly assisted the popularity of the instrument at that time.  Or, at least, that's what I've been told."

Pick a recording of the song you are trying to learn. You can even slow it down in programs like Audacity. And play it through. If you make a mistake, recover. Don't stop the song and start over again. Do that about a million times.  There are some metronomes that do an emphasis on the first beat (CLICK click click click CLICK click click click).

banjo,35ry1n,homer858,2,Wed May 13 02:06:21 2015 UTC,"Nope. You need a higher gauge. Tenor banjos have much shorter scale lengths ~22 inches compared to ~26 on a 5 string. Shorter scale means bigger strings.  Look up Chicago tuning. It's DGBE, the tuning you're looking for but with the 1st string tuned up a whole tone."

banjo,35shea,tametrees,3,Wed May 13 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"Trust me. It will. Anywhere your skin touches on the head will wear/become dirty. If you never ever touch the head, you probably won't see wear at all. Here is that ""new,"" head from the other album. This pic is month old now and I've accumulated more marks since. http://m.imgur.com/m3ytXwz   I guess if you're absolutely set on not wearing it yourself, you could find a shop that works on banjos and have them save a dirty old head for you when it's being replaced. But would you really want to play on someone else's sweat, dirt, and (in my case) blood?   Edit: you don't have to play hard to put wear on it. The first year I had that banjo, I only played it a little, and always very quiet. It still wore down in spots where my skin came in contact with the head. Dirt still accumulated etc."
banjo,35shea,Reese_Wallace,2,Wed May 13 06:23:42 2015 UTC,"Just curious, is all that blood from ""Scruggs style"" picking? I feel like if I picked my strings that hard I would pop them off track. Seriously though a bloody banjo head is one of the most badass things I've ever seen"
banjo,35shea,MyLittleFedora,2,Sat May 16 02:10:52 2015 UTC,"Haha it's from clawhammer style stuff. My band plays very hard and fast shit, so I play hard, bust my nail, then wear the skin down haha. I'm also VERY drunk by that point, so there's that."

banjo,35shea,homer858,1 point,Wed May 13 03:53:08 2015 UTC,All heads tend to accumulate oils from your hands and stuff. I've seen the frosting wear off a frosted Remo head while fiberskyn heads kind of start to delaminate when they've been beat on.

banjo,35nugq,UncleEck,1 point,Tue May 12 15:33:04 2015 UTC,Is there a particular reason you want a half-fretted? I play fretted and fretless on separate instruments but half-fretted banjos never made a lot of sense to me.
banjo,35nugq,UncleEck,1 point,Tue May 12 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of having the banjo not fretted where my fingers mostly are, for sliding and bending. And then also having the precision of the frets in the higher range. Do you find it difficult to play higher up without the frets? I'm also a violin player so I'm used to not playing with frets, but I figured a banjo would be different."

I would say these internal resonator designs have a less significant impact on overall tone than a full resonator.   On White Mountain banjos: I find them to be weirdly designed and kind of ugly, but that's a matter of personal taste. If I was going to buy an internal resonator banjo off of the BHO classifieds, I'd get that Reiter that's listed."

banjo,35gawg,RuthIessChicken,3,Sun May 10 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"A plus one for these two. Cripple Creek especially. Yes it's overdone and has something of a stigma, but it's a standard banjo tune that everyone knows and can play. I normally play clawhammer, so I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Old Joe Clark as another one to master."
banjo,35gawg,TheBanjoNerd,3,Sun May 10 02:54:23 2015 UTC,"There's a reason Cripple Creek is the most popular beginners tune. It's got everything a beginner needs. It is very basic, but it is perfect for teaching the first 5 frets of the neck and how the notes relate to each other. Even the most basic versions contain a slide, hammer-on, and pull-off. It has the potential for 1000 easy variations of almost every kind once you learn the tune. With one song, you can pretty much learn everything you need to know to become proficient."

banjo,35c00h,UncleEck,2,Sat May 9 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"I don't do a very good job documenting builds and I don't work off any plans.  Here are a few closeups and a few pictures I took along the way if anyone is interested:  http://imgur.com/a/kY4hx  A few of more details:    The nut is made out of a piece of deer antler.   The pip and string holders are just brass screws.  The pot is actually made out of some sort if plastic or Bakelite.  It seems a lot like PVC.  I'm not sure how old it is.  The skin appears to be real.  I originally carved a 2 post bridge but it pushes the skin in too sharply so I made a 4 post.  At some point I may turn a block rim and a mylar head but this thing is strong and keeps the weight down. If I leave the bridge standing up for a few days the head keeps an indention when you move it so I lay it down most of the time when I'm not playing.  A hair dryer will shrink it back tight in 30 seconds.  There is no truss rod.  I tried light gage metal strings. They gave it a lot more volume and snap, but I broke 2 1st strings tuning.  I guess they can't take the sharp turn into the pot.  I need to come up with some sort of roller system.  The peg err.. foot?  Shoe? Anyway it made from a solid block of walnut.  I have access to a milling machine.  Thanks for looking!  Edit: can't grammer."

banjo,354ff8,blancjua,1 point,Thu May 7 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"There are several manufacturers of nylon banjo strings. Some folks like the Chris Sands, I prefer the newer red set of Aquila Nylguts. If you prefer the DIY lo-fi route, I've seen people get good results with a variety of gauges of monofiliment fishing wire.   They can be put on any banjo but may require some changes to achieve a good setup. Sometimes the slots in the nut and bridge need to be widened to accommodate them. They're more prone to being damaged by burrs or sharp edges on the tailpiece or machine heads than steel strings, so that needs to be addressed as well. I love they way they feel and sound on a fretless banjo in particular, but lot of players use them on fretted banjos for oldtime two and three-finger styles and classic style playing."

banjo,34xqqp,dankscott94,6,Tue May 5 13:04:18 2015 UTC,"I started fretted and quickly jumped to fretless and prefer it, even though I'm still quite messy.    Couple things to note: nylon or nylgut strings are MUCH easier with fretless.  You get a clean note without having to use your nail.    Also, if you take a piece of painters tape, put it on the side of the neck, you can mark where the frets should be as a guide.  I found it helped me learn, even though its like cheating, but you can quickly remove the tape when you don't need it anymore."
banjo,34xqqp,iamnotchris,6,Tue May 5 13:45:37 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on learning clawhammer? If so, then learning on a fretless is fine. Especially if you've got an OK ear. Just make sure you're always in tune or you'll learn some bad habits.  If fretless is good enough for fiddle/cello/bass players, it's probably good enough for a banjer."
banjo,34xqqp,autovonbismarck,4,Tue May 5 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, much better for clawhammer. Where it gets really hard is trying to hold a chord."
banjo,34xqqp,xylum,1 point,Tue May 5 15:33:44 2015 UTC,You can use picking styles other than clawhammer on a fretless banjo.
banjo,34xqqp,UncleEck,2,Tue May 5 15:10:04 2015 UTC,sure but that's the main one that somebody new to the instrument is probably going to be learning.
banjo,34xqqp,autovonbismarck,2,Tue May 5 16:00:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't want to play anything super complicated on a fretless. Sure, there are people who can do it, but I'm not sure why you would want to."
banjo,34xqqp,nextyoyoma,3,Tue May 5 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"well, micro tones and slides for two. it can sound really nice. my friend Teilhard makes the banjo played in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vsn525I1do  He's playing clawhammer obviously, but it sounds great and there are some tones he can only get because it's on a fretless."
banjo,34xqqp,autovonbismarck,2,Tue May 5 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"I think the key is that you should play a fretless when you WANT slow slides and/or the effect of non-standard intonation. Generally, I would not combine these effects with virtuosic passage work.  I guess what I'm saying is that if you get to choose your instrument, choose the right instrument for the right job. Fretless is not always the right instrument, probably less often than a fretted one.  For some perspective, I have a degree in cello, and I play chords on it all the time. I play a little slide guitar (basically amounts to a fretless guitar), and it works just fine. However, I wouldn't want to play a fretless guitar while playing chords! It's just more difficult than it's worth."

banjo,34xqqp,meatsprinkles,3,Tue May 5 15:26:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I learned on the backyard music campfire banjo fretless version.   I switched to fretted pretty recently but I think learning on fretless actually helped me accuracy A LOT.   It's a big learning curve though
banjo,34xqqp,theredball,2,Tue May 5 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"For me, anything that acts as a barrier to playing real music as soon as possible is bad for me as a beginner.

banjo,34s8fn,TuxedoATX,1 point,Mon May 4 02:56:20 2015 UTC,Comments says the tuning is sawmill gDGCD but it still sounds a little different from when I play.  I can't tell what chords he's making.  I can pick out a version of the melody but it looks like I'm hitting different frets from what Mr. Hicks is playing in this version.  Any help is appreciated as I really love his version of this tune.
banjo,34s8fn,jdriselvato,2,Mon May 4 02:58:16 2015 UTC,To be honest from what I've seen from Clifton is he plays whatever key the banjo happens to be in. It might be the fact that the banjo is not in gDGCD. Hopefully you find someone who is more help then this but play around with the tuning.
banjo,34s8fn,UncleEck,2,Mon May 4 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"He's in sawmill but tuned down about a whole and a half step, so his root note (3rd string) is at E, so eBEAB. I wouldn't say he is really using chord changes, mostly just sketching out the melody to accompany his singing."

(If you're not sure on the distinction, here is a great summary I found here).   Personally I play clawhammer (not very well yet, only been ~1 month) and the left hand transferred pretty easily (and forced me to get better at hammer-ons than I ever was on guitar). The right hand was completely unusual at first, but I was able to pick it up pretty quick and I think guitar helped with that."

banjo,34refg,homer858,2,Mon May 4 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Slowly transitioning to banjo here after 15 years of guitar. I'm having a REALLY hard time adjusting to using my right hand on a banjo. It's like speaking a different language. Yeah, you can flat pick like a guitar, but that's really more for 4-stringed banjos I gather.*  *I'm very new, so I admit I may wrong in that regard."
banjo,34refg,mdmccat,2,Mon May 4 01:22:20 2015 UTC,"As has been said, left hand will be a pretty easy transfer. Right hand is very different from guitar though. Even though bluegrass picking is  a form of fingerpicking, it has a very different function. With guitar fingerpicking you're keeping a bass line with your thumb while playing melody and some harmony with your fingers. On banjo, everything is doing the same job: keeping the music moving. The technique is built around ""rolls"" called such because you're effectively playing a rolling arpeggio across the strings, each note in the series on a different string that it's predecessor (assuming all 1/8th notes). The most basic roll is a forward roll, going thumb, index, middle, repeat. Similarly there are backwards rolls, forwards backwards rolls, alternating rolls, and so on. The point is to keep moving no matter what."

You can a properly sized banjo tension wrench for about 10 bucks if you don't have a socket wrench.   When tightening it, take off the resonator so you can get to the nuts, and then tighten it until it's snug. Don't over tighten it as the adjacent hooks could come loose."

banjo,34anbx,AMAaboutmycocktattoo,7,Wed Apr 29 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"Heavier strings (and maybe not changing strings often), proper bridge placement, making sure the strings slide properly in the nut (take a pencil and run it between the grooves.  Upgrade your tuners if you can. Guitar tuners tend to be cheaper. Make sure all the screws are tightened on your tuners.   But yes, you are playing a barometer. As the banjo heats up, your tuning will be affected. Playing hard definitely impacts tuning as well. See if you can better monitors (I would also highly suggest investing in good pair of noise-reducing ear plugs."

banjo,34anbx,theredball,2,Thu Apr 30 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"Doubt you can put friction tuners in. The holes have to be reamed exactly right or they will be worse then what you have. Check that the screws on the tuners are tight, that the strings don't bind at the nut (pencil lead helps as has already been mentioned), tailpiece is tight, and bridge is positioned for correct intonation. Worn strings will go out of tune if you look at them wrong and if you are wailing away on them you probably need to change them twice as often as some one with a light touch. Upgrading your tuners might be the next step if none of this solves the problem. The Rustler is probably sporting a set of  cheap no name tuners."

banjo,3467e4,keggers5000,2,Tue Apr 28 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah for me, when I'm soloing I usually only do the bum-ditty for 1/4th or 1/8th of the measures. I will generally do a melody of slurs and d-t, and then finish the measure with a bum-ditty to maintain the good rhythm. I do this because I find that without a bum-ditty every couple measures, the melody seems to become disjointed and you lose a sense of rhythm."

banjo,3467e4,homer858,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:15:59 2015 UTC,The issue i struggle with playing clawhammer (coming from someone who has more experience soloing on a guitar) is that everything sounds the same to me. I try and mix up scales and notes but fall back on familiar rhythms and licks I know sound good. Are there techniques you use to combat this or is it something I will learn as I get better?
banjo,3467e4,T-Bobaru,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:35:34 2015 UTC,It sound like your issue is that you have a limited repertoire of licks you feel comfortable using. That'll get better with time and practice if you work at it. It takes time to be comfortable with the tuning and technique to a point of melodic freedom.   Some things I can recommend are as follows:   Drill drop thumb. Make sure you can play any string combination smoothly. Learn to play harmony. This will help you develop your counterpoint and melodic solos. You can also use two note chords with your melody and harmony to good effect.  Learn your chord voicings up and down the neck. Once you have these you'll have an easier time playing around the neck as you can use the chords as anchors.  Take licks you like on other instruments and transpose them.  Practice small ornamentation. Take a simple melody and change one or two notes each time you play it. Add some flourish.

You're likely going into a TRS plug on a live rig so that's low impedance. Beside that pick ups have low output. A direct box will convert the impedance as well as have a step up transformer. Going from a TS to an XLR for example, with the proper impedance. Not to mention some grounding options.

They're both nice but they're going to be different.   It's pretty important to handle your instrument before buying. You'll know when you find the right one

banjo,33z9jp,banjoman74,2,Mon Apr 27 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"Huge, Huge differences. Someone more adept than I is probably typing out a long list for you right now. Until they finish - obviously completely different aesthetics.   The Goodtime is a little better for clawhammer.  The Epiphone is a little more rounded and you see it comes with the resonator so it will be louder.   The Epiphone has a tone ring so it will sound a little more 'pingy' almost metallic if that makes sense (I'm a Banjo player not an expert by any means). The Goodtime is going to have a much warmer 'homey' sound. I'd say Epiphone is better for Bluegrass and non-traditional while the Goodtime is good for Clawhammer and folk.   -My 2 cents"

banjo,33upog,doctorfunknasty,6,Sun Apr 26 09:11:19 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound like an ass, but this is why I don't like tabs.   I watched this video, and thought to myself: ""Cool song, never heard it. I will figure out how to play it tomorrow.""  I don't think someone should need a tab for this song. It isn't that complicated. Don't be so dependent on tabs! You can do it, train your ears.   I'm sorry I realize that we don't know each other and I have no idea how long you've been playing. But my advice either way is not not depend on tabs so much."
banjo,33upog,Jvonachen,-2,Sun Apr 26 12:17:37 2015 UTC,"I like em. I forget songs overtime and having a tab book is the best reference for me.  Haha and yes you do sound like an ass, sir!"
banjo,33upog,_stonecoldsaidso,3,Sun Apr 26 18:15:25 2015 UTC,"I also use tabs, sometimes, to figure out hard parts of fiddle tunes. I think they're a valuable tool that shouldn't be completely ignored, and can really help beginners learn new songs right away.  That said, if you can't play a song without a piece of paper in front of you, you can't play the song. If your first instinct is to go to a tab when you want to learn a new song, you're doing it wrong. You should focus on hearing the tunes, that is how you progress as a musician."

banjo,33wfqj,theredball,2,Sun Apr 26 11:23:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on what type of banjo you would like to play. One way your skills might translate is through tenor banjo (4 string). Both instruments use the same tuning CGDA. Tenor has been used for jazz, swing band, folk, blues etc.   The five string is tuned differently though. There are two major types to play 5 string. Bluegrass aka fingerpicking, or Clawhammer aka oldtime/frailing. Watch and listen to videos of each and see which you are interested in.   Getting your hands on a banjo. Craigslist has always worked for me. You could also just spend some time in a music shop noodling around. I have an open back Epiphone mb100. They go for around 150. Has nice low action, sounds pretty good too.  Best of luck!"
banjo,33wfqj,Jvonachen,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:44:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in-depth answer, I'll definitely check out the tenor banjos."
banjo,33wfqj,homer858,2,Sun Apr 26 11:56:02 2015 UTC,"What kind of music do you want to play? As has been mentioned tenor banjo is tuned in 5ths like a viola, either CGDA or GDAE depending on what style of music you're playing. CGDA is used mostly for jazz and GDAE is mostly for celtic and folk.  If you're more interested in bluegrass or oldtime, they use 5 string banjos which are tuned totally differently, a G major tuning gDGBD being most common.   I'll also reccomend the Recording King Dirty Thirties line as good started that will last a while and are in your budget."
banjo,33wfqj,Gondela,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:50:27 2015 UTC,Definitely enjoy the celtic and folk side of things.  Thanks for the breakdown.
banjo,33wfqj,MyLittleFedora,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"Check out the banjohangout.com . Lots of information and banjo classified ads, and banjo reviews. In that price range you are looking for a used instrument.  Banjos need to be properly set up to play well, this makes amazon the least desirable place to get a banjo."
banjo,33wgxh,pantsforsatan,2,Sun Apr 26 07:53:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'll be able to explain this very well, but I feel like I should try.   First things first: a ""darker key"" is subjective. What sounds dark to you, might not to someone else.  A key in music just tells you what notes to play. There are 12 notes in music. Most scales do not include all 12 notes. So a key just tells you basically what note to start on, end on, and what to play in between. You can play the same song in different keys, the pitch of the song is all that changes. It's either higher or lower. The intervals between all 8 notes remain the same (In the case of a major scale there's 8 notes)  Now that's where modes come in. I was not taught that term, so I know of them as scales. A minor scale will change a couple of those intervals between notes, changing a few of the notes as well. That will change the sound of the key past just the pitch (if you change keys).  Do you have a keyboard or piano? Learning to play the piano is the best route to learn about music in my opinion. You pretty much have to learn some music theory to play piano. Anyone can be taught to strum a few chords on a guitar without knowing how they work together.   I fell like this would be easier to explain over skype. If you want to skype and ask questions I'd be willing to skype you for a bit sometime. Just pm me"
banjo,33wgxh,doctorfunknasty,0,Sun Apr 26 12:41:13 2015 UTC,"In violin music for example, the a key like Bb will be darker than D because D allows for more open strings, whereas Bb will have more notes with the LH fingers holding down strings (and therefore dampening the tone to some degree).  Similarly, on the banjo, I would say that D and G are fairly close in terms of brightness / darkness due to open string availability.  Some might argue that D is a brighter key in general, regardless of instrument.  If you're up to the challenge, you might try keys like F, Bb, Eb, etc. - though (without a capo) these are not commonly played banjo keys.  Another way to achieve a darker sound would be to change modes - perhaps learn some D minor or A minor (or Dorian, which is kind of between major and minor)."
