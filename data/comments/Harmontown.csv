Harmontown,3e4tqq,DrCoquenbols,0,Wed Jul 22 04:11:43 2015 UTC,He looked like a longer haired and more disheveled Dan.  But according to his accounts of what he's like during the writing process it seems believable.
Harmontown,3e517p,25schmeckels,6,Wed Jul 22 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt Dan would have wanted that job, honestly. He doesn't seem the type to want a big corporate sort of movie like this, and anyway he wouldn't be able to put his favorite mods in the movie.  It would have been funny to have Schrab on LEGO and Dan on Minecraft, though. The rivalry would quickly be blown out of proportion."

Harmontown,3dxr8v,KajusX,4,Mon Jul 20 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"I love giraffes! They're one of my favorite animals. I would love to visit Giraffe Manor which is what the OP's picture is from. I also love Dan criticizing the hell out of them because it's hilarious to hate on animals for evolutionary traits, like they could change even if they wanted to. I also grew up around horses, so Dan's criticism of them being long horses may be valid. I just enjoy how crazy tall giraffes are, and sometimes I think about what a 'giraffe saddle' would look like.  For my high school's official 'senior skip' day (a school-devised day to hopefully discourage actual senior skip day, which did not work) buses took all the seniors to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The giraffe area is designed in such a way that there's the visitor fence and about about 6-10 feet of ground beyond it that then forms a wall for the giraffe enclosure. So the giraffes could walk up to their wall which was about as high as the middle of their body, and then their heads could just barely reach across the no man's land to the fence where visitors could stand and hand-feed them giraffe crackers purchased from a zoo vendor.  After watching my classmates react to the giraffes plucking the crackers from their hands with their 20""-long, prehensile tongues, I had the super-smart idea of holding a cracker with my mouth like a trick you could do with a lama or any variety of tame herbivore. I leaned slightly over the railing to compensate for not using my hands, and I was expecting the usual, tongue-takes-cracker method.  To everyone's surprise, the giraffe easily closed the gap and then wrapped its giant lips around my face to take the cracker. I was slobbered on from my chin all the way up to the bridge of my nose. Thankfully, I was not bitten by the giraffe nor did anyone yell at me in an authoritative capacity or otherwise. Just a lot of people either saying ""WHOA!"" or ""EWWW!"" and then everyone laughing.  So I already liked giraffes, but that zoo trip sealed the deal. They're pretty gentle creatures according to my purely anecdotal experience!"

I would guess many sitcom plots that Dan watched when he was younger involved this trope but I think that's more about the fact that there's not a ton of variety in conflicts at a prom situation, so I'm sure most prom episodes of sitcoms involved father confrontations."
Harmontown,3dzqll,thesixler,6,Mon Jul 20 21:13:07 2015 UTC,Ok cool.  I was worried because when I went to prom and didn't fight with my dad and I felt like I maybe missed out on something...

Not to come down on it, but I just don't think it's for me. It just always feels a little too broad & little bit disjointed. At the same time, most paranormal podcasts either take themselves way too seriously or flat out aren't funny if they do try.

Harmontown,3dlckt,Holy_Balls_,13,Fri Jul 17 06:22:52 2015 UTC,I emailed Jeff a link.

I'm going to play this on an endless loop until I lose grip with reality, take the song as a cryptic metaphor for the unfairness of life, go insane, wake up in a different country believing that I am Dan Harmon, marrying a woman having a family, only to accidentally hear this song again, regain my memory and return home to enjoy it more."

Harmontown,3dlckt,awesometakespractice,4,Fri Jul 17 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  All the instruments on these are instrument patches from my keyboard, a Yamaha Motif.  I often just live record myself playing each instrument part one at a time.  For putting music behind pre-existing vocals, there's a little planning involved:  First I did a little light editing of the original (fixing Dan stumbling on a couple words) to make the tempo as even as possible.  Then I mapped a click over the whole thing, figured out the best chords to go behind it, recorded a simple piano track first, and then added the other instruments and mixed until it felt finished."

Harmontown,3ddebe,moonbaseapplicant,20,Wed Jul 15 11:52:09 2015 UTC,"Pedantic note that I'm sure no one cares about as much as me:  Stephen Notley was wrong about how the color wheel works. He said that we represent color as a closed circle where purple meets red because we can't see below red or above purple, and... well, it was unclear what conclusion he was drawing from that, but he seemed like he was saying it represented a limitation on our ability to accept the world as it really is or something like that. That a closed color wheel was arbitrary given that the spectrum is a line that goes from below our perception to above it.  Actually, the color wheel doesn't represent where color sits on the electromagnetic spectrum, which is vastly bigger than what our eyes can detect. It represents how the color receptors in our eyes access that information. We have red, green, and blue receptors. Those receptors can be activated to any degree and in any combination. Red links to green through yellow because yellow is what happens when red and green receptors are both activated. Similarly, red links to blue through purple because purple is what happens when the red and blue receptors are activated. Thus, purple and red connect on the color wheel.  Talking about how humans see color and what color is (merely frequencies of visible light) in the physical world are two different things, not at odds with each other, just with different mechanisms, and thus different descriptive models.  There. Now I've been that guy who rushes to correct people about things that don't matter in contexts that don't necessitate accuracy. My work here is done."

Harmontown,3ddebe,LenaDunhamsThighGap,11,Thu Jul 16 21:28:12 2015 UTC,I think Dan bugs Erin about colors because she bugs him about Minecraft.
Harmontown,3ddebe,okem,10,Wed Jul 15 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"I think he likes to be dismiss the stuff certain other people like as dumb whilst telling everyone he's the smartest person ever, because he's insecure. That shit will make you act like an arsehole soon enough. (too serious?)"
Harmontown,3ddebe,Promen-ade,6,Wed Jul 15 19:10:17 2015 UTC,I think it's the contrast between innocuous problem and passionate rant that's the joke.
Harmontown,3ddebe,okem,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"Sure. nothing wrong with that. But it seemed like a thought that came from Dan and Erin's personal life, so it kinda had a subtext. Really wasn't meant in a judgemental way. Just one of those things."
Harmontown,3ddebe,GnomeFondler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:56:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say that's too serious. Maybe he is an asshole, (I personally would disagree with you, but that's irrelevant) however, I doubt that talking about it here on a subreddit would have any positive effect."
Harmontown,3ddebe,okem,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't calling anyone an arsehole. Everyone can act like one at times though. Big difference. And this is Harmontown where incredibly personal shit is often laid out bare. But I wouldn't claim to really know anything about Dan or Erin. Not beyond what they've shared with all us over the years. So very little, in reality.   I won't be alone in knowing from personal experience that at times it's easy to be mean and thoughtless towards the people you care about. And like one of those four steps, or whatever they were, the one they all liked, 'it's not about you'. Well often someone being kinda thoughtless to someone they care about is more about their own shit than the person they're directing that negativity towards. If that makes sense. I wasn't trying to throw stones at anyone or expecting to solve anything.   Now to lighten the mood..  ╰U╯☜(◉ɷ◉ )"
Harmontown,3ddebe,RetroDave,8,Thu Jul 16 23:45:05 2015 UTC,"So, I had a thought the ""everyone wants to be the lead singer!"" discussion. I think Spencer hinted at this by saying something akin to ""I don't the podcast named after me"".  Dan was essentially Jon Bon Jovi arguing with Jeff's Richie Sambora saying ""The rest of you want must to do what I do!"", right? Is that too much of a reach?"
Harmontown,3ddebe,DeleteMASH,11,Thu Jul 16 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"I think that's the case he ended up making, but I think the discussion was sort of revealing. He said that everybody wants to be the lead singer assuming they are an amazing, charismatic singer. But a lot of great singers don't like singing because regardless of their talent, they don't think they're good, so I don't think that's true. I think the reason a lot of musicians prefer playing supporting roles is that they can relax and have fun instead of feeling tons of pressure, again, regardless of their actual talent. That's certainly how I feel as a musician - I'd rather play bass or rhythm guitar and sing some harmonies than have the pressure of carrying the whole show.  However, Dan probably feels the full pressure of the success of the show even if he's in a supporting role. That's why he's a workaholic - he's a perfectionist. So singing lead, for him, is the best way to make things meet his own expectations. It keeps him in control.  [edited to fix shitty formatting]"
Harmontown,3ddebe,MeowingForVengeance,6,Thu Jul 16 16:18:01 2015 UTC,He should talk to Ben Folds about this. I've heard Ben talk more than once about not liking his own voice. A lot of musicians are songwriters first and singers second--they sing their songs because no one else will.

Harmontown,3ddebe,BbCortazan,3,Thu Jul 16 22:07:31 2015 UTC,I have a solo project where I sing and I'm in a band where I play guitar. I can sing and I quite enjoy being front and center but it's nice to be able to just sit back and jam with the band. When I'm just playing guitar I feel like I can sync up with the crowd better and set the performance and energy of the band even if the crowd is more focused on the singer/other guitar player.
Harmontown,3ddebe,bigdirkmalone,8,Thu Jul 16 22:09:47 2015 UTC,"I think Spencer's comment was perfect but got lost in Jeff/Dan arguing.   Some people just don't want/need to be the center of attention.  However, if the person grew up their entire life with the perfect voice/hair combination would their environment shaped them into an attention seeker?"
Harmontown,3ddebe,awesometakespractice,8,Thu Jul 16 15:48:15 2015 UTC,I think Spencer's comment was perfect but got lost in Jeff/Dan arguing.    welcome to Harmontown!
Harmontown,3ddebe,bigdirkmalone,2,Fri Jul 17 14:36:09 2015 UTC,True story.
Harmontown,3ddebe,apaeter,7,Fri Jul 17 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"Hehe, that part was the first time I had to skip forward in Harmontown. He was just so wrong about this, it drove me crazy.  As a singer/bass player in a rock band - if a fairy godmother made that offer to me, I'd pick ""kick-ass drum chops"" in a heartbeat. Drumming is such fucking fun.   Maybe he never played an instrument and doesn't know how great it is to crank up an amp all the way and let the audience have it? :)"
Harmontown,3ddebe,4514,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. However, I feel like what Dan meant was that""everyone wants to be the star.""   So if there was a universe where the drums where the main lead, you'd prefer to go there right?  I think that's the point he was making. It's a pretty obvious choice, and that's why I think it came off badly."
Harmontown,3ddebe,thesixler,2,Sat Jul 18 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"I personally agree with Dan, but maybe it's just because I personally would want to be the lead singer if I was the best singer on stage. In a world where money and talent isn't an issue and I'm just up there playing music I think it'd be most fun to be lead singer, absolutely. And it's hard to imagine why someone wouldn't want to be the lead singer if they had the talent and were given the opportunity.  I always thought the mentality behind ""I just want to be in a supporting role"" was because Person X knows someone else is better for the lead role, so to make the overall production the best it can be Person X would defer the lead role and take a supporting role. But in the scenario Dan is using, Person X is super talented and given the chance to be a super talented lead singer or super talented bass player, there's no way that Person X wouldn't pick lead singer."
Harmontown,3ddebe,trubbub,7,Thu Jul 16 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"I just dunno. I know people who are amazing at drawing and don't pursue it. I know people that like playing a lot of instruments, and they like playing instruments they are worse at than the ones they are better at.  The mentality of a band doesn't HAVE to be 'everyone do the best they can and do it in the best position they can do it in,' it can be 'let's just have fun and jam out' which is completely outside the scope of what dan seems capable of imagining."
Harmontown,3ddebe,TheOnePickle,2,Thu Jul 16 23:41:32 2015 UTC,"I just think the whole idea that someone who plays bass is only doing so because they can't sing is deeply flawed. I've been playing music for a long time and I have never met a bass player where that was their motivation. Most people who aren't talented enough to be great singers don't pick up the bass, they're just shitty singers.  I think the real problem was that the whole argument was based on a magical talent giving fairy. And in that scenario, all the bass players would wish to be lead singers? You could do anything, and you're going with music as your career in 2015?  edit: Yes, also know some people that would rather play on an unfamiliar instrument. Sometimes it's just about learning new shit."
Harmontown,3ddebe,obamunistpig,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"why is it hard to imagine someone not being a lead singer? I'd much rather be the guitarist. it was a just a simple question by Jeff, and dan had to turn it into this dumb thing. Fact is, some people just want to play the bass. it's not about insecurity, they just want to play the bass"
Harmontown,3ddebe,4514,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think he glanced over an important point Jeff made, aka, Keanu Reeves is a fucking movie star and in his ideal world he's just playing bass.  If he was a glory-hound, he'd be satiated!"
Harmontown,3ddebe,RetroDave,16,Fri Jul 17 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like Dan's entire world view comes from reading a book about story, a book about monkeys, and taking one community college biology class.  Edit: And I'm glad that it happened that way. His world view is awesome and I love hearing him talk about it. I realized that the original comment may have sounded negative, it isn't meant to be."

Harmontown,3ddebe,nicolauz,6,Thu Jul 16 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of his need to deconstruct and simplify things into the essential components, and then rebuild them from there. In the same way that he's broken down the Campbellian monomyth into an 8-point story circle, he breaks down evolution and the human condition to have two major reasons for anything: the good of the species (race, transgenderism, morality in general) or the good of the individual (narcissism, everyone wants to be the lead singer, etc.). It seems like a lot of his opinions come from one of these two interests, and they're interests that are internalized in all of us to different extents.  Or maybe I'm reading too much into this.

Never thought it would lend itself to a comedy show but I haven't been to the SD one.  Edit: and glad to hear they had a good time! As far as food, the Pollo del Sol Quesadilla (I think that's still what it's called on the menu) is the best. It's chicken, cheese, guac, sun dried tomatoes, and some kind of BBQ sauce (I always order it without the sauce). Bands usually have food covered, which is great. The downside of Tin Roof gigs are that they're usually 4 hours with no breaks and 90%+ covers, though Tin Roof Baltimore does two sets 1.5 hours each."

Harmontown,3ddebe,ElvisJNeptune,3,Sat Jul 18 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the use of the atomic bomb is that its first use in Hiroshima was first and foremost approved with the intention of ending the war, as well as sending a signal to the Soviets.  The second, on Nagasaki, however, was dropped almost immediately despite a high likelihood that Japan would surrender if given more time.  This was done in order to end the war quickly, preventing the Russians from gaining more land."
Harmontown,3ddebe,Abziehvorgel,8,Wed Jul 15 13:03:11 2015 UTC,They were both right!
Harmontown,3ddebe,Gonzzzo,3,Wed Jul 15 13:04:38 2015 UTC,Indeed. Maybe Dan's next realization will be not to insist on the anti-american explanation for everything. (He's never gonna like giraffes though.)

Harmontown,3ddebe,Abziehvorgel,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:37 2015 UTC,Criticizing the political motivations behind a war generals decision to incinerate thousands of people isn't anti-american. If anything it's anti-that guy and that administration.
Harmontown,3ddebe,Promen-ade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's not. I regret my post a little, since one should write more clearly and precisely while manouvering this difficult territory and I'd much rather just joke around. Specifically I was referring to Dan saying it was an ""excuse"" to reveal ""our"" mushroom-cloud-card, dismissing other reasons completely. (Just to be clear, I believe a demonstration of power was an important factor too.) Also it wasn't my intention to shame or blame him, but I've noticed a tendency to jump to the oversimplifying narrative of the evil, capitalist empire before. I might be oversensitive in this regard. Here in Germany a certain kind of convenient anti-americanism is very common, esspecially among the political left (which I consider myself a part of)."
Harmontown,3ddebe,Abziehvorgel,3,Thu Jul 16 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting. Are you German or just living there?   And for oversimplification, guess we're on the same page after all. I agree that it's a real problem in the way people want to talk about things because the truth is almost always super complex and totally gray. I would never describe the capitalist empire as ""evil"" for those reasons, because that's attaching human emotions and motivations to an inhuman entity. What I would say is that historically power has proven itself to function in the interest of it's own growth and preservation, and the problem is exactly that it's not human, and the only way for empathy to enter the equation is through the minds of the disassociated parts (people) that compose it's sum, and a lot of the time that just doesn't happen, because it's too abstract and empathy doesn't work in the abstract. It works in eye contact and screams that'll never make it across the ocean."

Agreed again. Although one might argue that empathy/sympathy can too confuse our moral compass, if combined with the right (or rather wrong) believes."

Also, that's cool. I'm midwestern American myself. I definitely incorrectly assumed you were as well from your first comment, but I think a lot of Americans live with a paranoia of the international community thinking they're all a bunch of maniacs so someone from Germany calling for a more nuanced critique of America wasn't really on my radar. Guess that's more evidence against assuming things."
Harmontown,3ddebe,Abziehvorgel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"Nice example, I should've thought of that! In a way it's easier for me to make that point, since I don't have to worry about being reduced to patriotism/jingoism. I am mostly surrounded by left leaning peers (critical of American military power and capitalism), but since I am allergic to groupthink, I often find myself arguing the other side."
Harmontown,3ddebe,thesixler,2,Thu Jul 16 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"I once read somewhere, that not using the abomb after having spent a fantastical amount of money on its developement would have been political suicide. Multicausality!"
Harmontown,3ddebe,Promen-ade,3,Wed Jul 15 15:38:43 2015 UTC,I mean absolutely. It's not like each of these decision makers only had one person advising them with one set on information and one set of intentions and reasons.
Harmontown,3ddebe,JohnnyMalo,6,Thu Jul 16 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"There's also a certain silliness to the way everyone fixates on the nukes when the firebombings carried out by the allied powers were just as devastating and horrific. I doubt the people on the streets of Dresden when the entire thing became an inferno would've much cared if it'd been a nuke instead. WWII was the birth of the idea of the home front, i.e. the recognition of the civilian powered war production as just an extension of the war, and thus, its okay to kill them all too, and that to me is the real moral schism worth examining."
Harmontown,3ddebe,unwholesome,2,Thu Jul 16 17:01:49 2015 UTC,Excellent point.
Harmontown,3ddebe,Kerbogha,3,Thu Jul 16 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"There was not a high likelihood of Japan surrendering. Truman called for terms after the first bomb and Japan refused, believing they could endure one or even two more such attacks. Nagasaki proved them wrong and spared an estimated million American lives in the process.  Frankly I'm not convinced that a standard invasion wouldn't have fucked up Japan even more than fat man and little boy. Look at the firebombing of Tokyo, which claimed up to 200,000 lives."
Harmontown,3ddebe,unwholesome,3,Wed Jul 15 13:22:10 2015 UTC,"I'm in total agreement that a land invasion would have been worse for Japan than two nuclear attacks, and I think the bombings were the right thing to do.  My point was just that the U.S. didn't give Japan as much time as they needed before we attacked Nagasaki (which I might be wrong about)."
Harmontown,3ddebe,nodice182,3,Wed Jul 15 13:26:27 2015 UTC,"Reading up on it some more, it seems like part of the problem was that the government had been more willing to accept terms than the military had, which resulted in the Japanese army trying to declare martial law to prevent a surrender.   But of course, one must wonder how long the military could have held out politically, and perhaps Hirohito would have intervened without the second bomb if given enough time to consider the consequences. Why indeed did the second bomb need to be dropped mere days after the first? Although my earlier point was to suggest that Japan may not have been as close to surrender as we've though, I agree with you that were were probably sending a message to other world powers as well."
Harmontown,3ddebe,Redjobnuns,3,Wed Jul 15 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"There was not a high likelihood of Japan surrendering.    The US Strategic Bombing Survey, a detailed post-WWII analysis conducted by the US Navy, concluded that-   ""Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.""   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Strategic_Bombing_Survey#Atomic_bombing"
Harmontown,3ddebe,nodice182,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not challenging your source but seeing as this is postwar information, do we know what American leadership actually knew at the time?"
Harmontown,3ddebe,SlackBadger,2,Fri Jul 17 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, we knew a lot about the goings-on of the Japanese High Command virtually as it happened, since the US had cracked the 'Purple' code of the Japanese Foreign Office by as early as 1941.  Essentially, the US knew that Japan was seeking surrender, at least conditionally. This likely would've meant the preservation of the Emperor, possibly immunity for war crimes, that sort of stuff. To many of the Allies, anything less than unconditional surrender was pretty much unacceptable.  Thus begins the stuff we knew.   Early in May 1945, the Supreme War Direction Council began active discussion of ways and means to end the war, and talks were initiated with Soviet Russia seeking her intercession as mediator.  The talks by the Japanese ambassador in Moscow and with the Soviet ambassador in Tokyo did not make progress. On 20 June the Emperor, on his own initiative, called the six members of the Supreme War Direction Council to a conference and said it was necessary to have a plan to close the war at once, as well as a plan to defend the home islands. The timing of the Potsdam Conference interfered with a plan to send Prince Konoye to Moscow as a special emissary with instructions from the cabinet to negotiate for peace on terms less than unconditional surrender, but with private instructions from the Emperor to secure peace at any price. Although the Supreme War Direction Council, in its deliberations on the Potsdam Declaration, was agreed on the advisability of ending the war, three of its members, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Navy Minister, were prepared to accept unconditional surrender, while the other three, the Army Minister, and the Chiefs of Staff of both services, favored continued resistance unless certain mitigating conditions were obtained.   ...   There is little point in attempting precisely to impute Japan's unconditional surrender to any one of the numerous causes which jointly and cumulatively were responsible for Japan's disaster. The time lapse between military impotence and political acceptance of the inevitable might have been shorter had the political structure of Japan permitted a more rapid and decisive determination of national policies. Nevertheless, it seems clear that, even without the atomic bombing attacks, air supremacy over Japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion.   We knew Japan was looking to surrender months before the bombs were dropped, so a fair bit of it boils down to the politics of conditional vs unconditional surrender. As with all history, it gets more in depth than that though.  And since maybe the gist of what I wrote was perhaps too anti-bombing, it's perhaps worth pointing out that a key factor in getting Japan to the point of accepting surrender in the first place was the incredibly devastating, demoralising and indiscriminate aerial bombing campaign of Japanese cities conducted prior to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So there's that : /  It's also worth considering that even after Hiroshima, Japan ultimately got (elements of) the conditional surrender it wanted, by maintaining the position of the Emperor. In fact, if this option had been left in the Potsdam Declaration, it's likely Japan would've surrendered sooner.  A few places of historical discussion have framed the bombing not so much as a decision, but a product of general attitudes in the military at the time. After its development, it was always assumed that the bomb would be used.  Sorry if I wrote too much, but I enjoy talking about history."
Harmontown,3ddebe,hAND_OUT,2,Sat Jul 18 19:55:39 2015 UTC,The Japanese were holding out because they hoped that they could get the Soviets to help mediate a conditional peace. Once the Soviets declared war on the 8th and started the invasion of Manchuria the next day was when the Japanese knew there was no hope.

Monday morning I was on a plane back home. Flight got delayed so I didn't make it back home until around 7pm. Tuesday morning I start editing the show together.  I start with a few dozen files. Three cameras each producing files of about 20 minutes each, and the audio feed as a .WAV file. I have to line those all up pretty close to perfectly or the audio and video aren't in sync. Then I've got to edit the whole thing together, flipping back and forth between the three shots, zooming and panning around to keep whatever's happening on screen. It was another 40 minutes of color correction, to bring things back from 100% purple. Once that's done, I kick off the render/encode process which takes about an hour. The results of that take another 45 minutes to upload to the server, I create the wordpress post and it's up.

He just knows exaclty what details to focus on and what to leave out for the benefit of who's listening. I love it 100%  Jeff should write a book."
Harmontown,3ddcwv,SinisterrKid,6,Wed Jul 15 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"Ha, my dad does this constantly and I always used to back him up, but it's become unsustainable.  He's told these same stories so many times over the years and keeps embellishing, often to the same people.  Eventually someone calls him out on it and he always reacts with the same variation of ""Come on, everybody knows!  Just let me have this.""  He's 70 and it's like he's trying to create new, more exciting memories.  It's adorable and hilarious.  BRB, calling my dad."

Harmontown,3ddcwv,Abziehvorgel,2,Wed Jul 15 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I just remembered Dino's story on that show :-( That might have been the most disgusted I've been by myself for listening to these people.

Harmontown,3ddcwv,SinisterrKid,3,Wed Jul 15 23:28:51 2015 UTC,"Dino tells the origin story of his BDSM fetish. It involves finishing into an old man's mouth, after a woman... Ahem... Squeezes a bag of her own feces into the old man's mouth...  It's not pleasant imagery-- but I think Dino told the story very humbly-- I wasn't that offended by it.

Harmontown,3ddcwv,conman16x,15,Wed Jul 15 12:13:00 2015 UTC,There's also an older episode where Dan mentions that Jeffs stories tend to be a bit too fantastical to be completely true and he's sure he exaggerates a lot.
Harmontown,3ddcwv,Grimmgrinningghost,11,Wed Jul 15 12:30:22 2015 UTC,I thought there was an episode where Dan said Jeff's stories are crazy but he's been around Jeff enough to believe they're true.
Harmontown,3ddcwv,CunningStunts,4,Wed Jul 15 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he said that he thinks they are true, more or less. But that his stories tend to be a bit on the nose for whatever topic is being discussed."
Harmontown,3ddcwv,Grimmgrinningghost,3,Wed Jul 15 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember on the ""I'm Like Very Science"" episode Dan was ranting about it and he specifically said ""I mean, he's not lying"". I think if you're as charming, extroverted and curious as Jeff, on a place like Hollywood, interesting shit is bound to happen to you."
Harmontown,3ddcwv,SinisterrKid,5,Wed Jul 15 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"I felt vindicated for feeling so skeptical about Jeff's stories when he & Dan tell a story from the bar they'd been at together before one of the Portland shows. Jeff starts out telling the story & at every point Dan says ""that's not what happened"" or ""that's an exaggeration"" until Dan just takes over & tells the story himself  Jeff rarely tells a fantastical story that doesn't have ""So I was by myself"" somewhere at the beginning  ...Like running into Nic Cage on a elevator in Louisiana...or quasi-orgies in France...or the old usher guy remembering him at a theater...  He's also told a 15 minute haunting/ghost story that where he exorcises ghosts twice....and he starts the story by saying ""I don't believe in ghosts""...iirc he also says ""I don't think I'm psychic"" before all his multiple stories where he obviously thinks he's psychic  Like I think some of his stories probably have a foundation of truth, like the ""Jefferson Davis"" story is believable enough. I just think a lot of the stories he tells are mostly exaggerations that're nothing close to how it actually happened IRL. I can believe that a gas station clerk or cab driver in the South didn't want to take Jeff's money due to his name, but I can't believe that it happened back-to-back in a 5 minute span. I believe Jeff thinks he's psychic, but I don't believe he has any real stories that would make people believe he's psychic...but it really bugs me when he starts out those stories with ""I don't believe in this thing I'm about to tell a story about""  I don't think Jeff is committing some big sin or anything, he's just trying to make maximum entertainment stories to tell with maximum appeal...it's just that many of them amount to a guy telling a story about how awesome he/his life is...all that said, I don't find his LA celebrity stories hard to believe"
Harmontown,3ddcwv,Gonzzzo,6,Wed Jul 15 16:54:27 2015 UTC,"The ""female doctor calls in all the nurses to see his giant penis"" story is my favorite Jeff Davis tall tale. He has some great stories, but I always take them with a grain (or a whole shaker full) of salt."

Harmontown,3ddcwv,buttse,3,Thu Jul 16 01:28:46 2015 UTC,"Can't recall the episode, exactly. I want to say it was in response to the ""Dan's Season 6 Adderall Doctor Yelp Search"" story but I might be way off there."

Harmontown,3ddcwv,Gonzzzo,3,Wed Jul 15 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a friend years back who was the same Storyteller Archetype as Jeff. Always hilarious and entertaining, every time he left to run an errand he would return with an amazing 45 minute anectdote.  Then I started to recognize things that I was actually there for, walking by a security guard became campus police with guns drawn, an attractive woman became a super model, and so on. Didn't make me like him less, and it's not like we didn't have plenty of batshit adventures, but he was good at, and addicted to, embellishment.  My only critique with Jeff stories is he is always an amazing hero. They would be more fun if they didn't always end with strangers thanking him.  As for celebrities, if I have been at the same party as the Coen Brothers, John Slattery, and Angelina Jolie, then anyone can."
Harmontown,3ddcwv,Redjobnuns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"They would be more fun if they didn't always end with strangers thanking him.   lol I forgot about this too.   But yea, we all went to highschool with a guy like that. I even give Jeff a lot of leeway because I can sympathize with being the loner guy who gets into crazy shit. I'm one of the people who wanders off all night at music festivals while my friends are sleeping. I live in the middle of nowhere but last year I had an insane evening with a taxi driver who ended up also being a drug dealer & a pimp on a meth bender.   I'm really stoned & rambling. But I'm saying I get that Jeff has a lot of true but crazy solo stories that sound made-up, but yea, it just feels like he's never not exaggerating any story to make himself look better (and at worst, it just sounds like he's making shit up). I think that's the big difference with Dan's stories, 3 outta 5 of them he's making himself the joke, or at least being self-deprecating. We all know Dan exaggerates through his descriptions of things, but I always feel like the story he's telling is true"
Harmontown,3ddcwv,Gonzzzo,3,Wed Jul 15 21:20:37 2015 UTC,I agree with you except for that I think the Jefferson Davis stories are complete bullshit. I live in the South and racist historians aren't going to give you a bunch of free stuff because of your name.
Harmontown,3ddcwv,ObviousFakeMustache,5,Wed Jul 15 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, a few free drinks at bars is about the most I'm willing to believe in that scenario  I have a very hard time believing that anybody is so pro-confederacy that they're willing to come up short on their cash register at the end of their shift or waste profits on gas for a free taxi ride"

I'd believe that someone who was moderately semi-famous in Hollywood for a decade and a half had been at a party that Keanu Reeves was at once or twice. He's certainly got a lot of stories, and I'd buy that they're being told in the most interesting way possible, but I'm happy to believe that he met Tom Petty in a line for a documentary once."

On top of being semi-famous with lots of free time in LA, which is just famous enough to get into parties and the culture but not so famous as to be threatening and threatened, he's a handsome, nice, funny guy, very accommodating (he's close with Harmon.)

Written by Allan Carr and Bronté Woodard, the film is a pseudo-biography of disco's Village People which bears only a vague resemblance to the actual story of the group's formation. It was produced by Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment (formerly EMI Films), and distributed by independent distributor Associated Film Distribution (AFD).  Can't Stop the Music is notorious for being the first winner of the Worst Picture Golden Raspberry Award, for it was a double feature of this and Xanadu that inspired John J. B.

The annoying thing is some people have serious knee/back problems, but not serious enough to be like ""I deserve a chair"" so you just stand there feeling like an asshole for thinking you deserve something cavemen invented.   I really really hate standing at gigs unless it's a band."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,Optional1,2,Mon Jul 13 14:59:01 2015 UTC,"I really really hate standing at gigs unless it's a band.   I think that's the problem.  That is a decent music venue, but the Harmontown team really shit the bed when they decided to book it for this show."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,Weembles,7,Mon Jul 13 18:32:39 2015 UTC,I was annoyed that there were so many reserved seats that stayed empty the entire show.
Harmontown,3d4qzh,deathspresso,10,Mon Jul 13 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"This seating situation was ridiculous, more than half the audience was standing only which would be fine if they hadn't herded people from the downstairs to the upstairs.  Even at 6'1'' it was hard to see from upstairs there were so many people crammed against the railings."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,51n,7,Mon Jul 13 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly the seating was pretty bad. I'm tall so I managed to still see the show, more or less. But eh.  At least they know they have fans in SD now and will likely not underestimate their turnout next time."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,HisRoyalDudeliness,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seemed like a pretty healthy portion of the audience was just san diego locals that were fans rather than people who were visiting for comic con and stayed for the show. I know that Dan has said that he doesn't like San Diego, but I hope they start coming down a little more often than once a year now."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,IlluminatedWorld,9,Tue Jul 14 03:15:57 2015 UTC,"At the meltdown, seating is first come first serve, and the latecomers have to stand in the back. The same thing occurred here.  Our choice of venue was limited by the bookings made by other acts at comic-con so I'm sure you can understand why accommodations were small, and why our time slot was Sunday night at 7 pm at comic-con.  That said, the tin roof was amazing and accommodating, they took care of us all, and we would love to do more gigs there. Probably selling less tickets though, that way instead of not being able to sit we will just have people who aren't able to attend. I don't suspect the tin roof is used to hosting 400+ people at their bar."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,thesixler,7,Mon Jul 13 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"It wasn't so much the standing that was problem. If we had been allowed to stand down on the first floor we could have more or less been able to see the stage because of the angles. When there are so many people on the top level trying to look down, you just can't see anything if you're more than a couple spaces back. I think if they had let us have all of the extra space downstairs it would have been fine.  I still had a lot of fun though and I hope that you guys consider coming down to San Diego more often!"
Harmontown,3d4qzh,IlluminatedWorld,4,Tue Jul 14 03:28:33 2015 UTC,We plan to!
Harmontown,3d4qzh,thesixler,2,Tue Jul 14 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem was that the fire marshall was being extremely strict during Comic Con. There are all sorts of rules about where chairs can be and who can stand where, before it risks getting the whole thing shut down. I agree that the venue was probably oversold for how many seats were possible. It kinda sounds like the people running the bar thought this would be more like a music show where not everyone would go sit at once - some people would go sit at one of the two bars, some would sit in front of the show, etc."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,kevinday,2,Tue Jul 14 23:26:25 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that they overbooked, it was just that they forced essentially everybody that didn't have a seat upstairs. I don't know what sort of fire codes they might have been violating if they had let people stay down on the first level, but I think it would have found an equilibrium pretty easily as plenty of people would have chosen to stay upstairs since as long as you had a view it was pretty nice."
Harmontown,3d4qzh,IlluminatedWorld,2,Tue Jul 14 23:46:39 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that the upper and lower floors each had an occupancy limit. No idea though, I agree it wasn't handled the best."

I'm average height- 5'6"" and even ten feet from the stage, I could hardly get a good view.  When they started Shadowrun, I moved to the back and sat against the pinball machine. Drinking and standing mostly immobile don't work well past a certain point of time and drinks. Also, the gang seemed super tired. Comic-Con must have tuckered them the fuck out. Still glad I went though."

Harmontown,3d4qzh,Time_Fox,-6,Tue Jul 14 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Meh.  From my perspective the show was fine.  More comfy, by far, than Nerdmelt theatre.  Also, if you have this much of a problem with poor seating, show up early.  I was damn near a whole block down in the line to get in and I managed to grab a full booth of seats on the ground level.  Comfy as hell and LOTS of room.  I do agree with the reserved seats being a bit weird.  Anyone know what the deal was there?"

Harmontown,3d3rvk,huntsaboteur,4,Mon Jul 13 15:30:24 2015 UTC,"Don't remember, something like ""We didn't bomb them as a demonstration of power or as a challenge for them to bomb us back, it was more to just bring the war to an end.""  He also mentioned that it was too foggy that day, so they didn't get to kill as many people as they we wanted too."
Harmontown,3d3rvk,LarryMahnken,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"We bombed them because it was a war, the atomic bomb was a weapon, and so we used the weapon.  It wasn't any different than the bombings we had done in the previous months, except in this case it was one bomb.  We didn't have the view of the atomic bomb then that we do now, that it is a device capable of destroying the world.  We were in the largest war in history, we had the most powerful weapon in history, we used it.  The second bomb was dropped without orders from Truman - the military used it in the next available window to use it, and the President had to quickly send an order out telling them not to drop any more bombs without his explicit orders."
Harmontown,3d3rvk,SlackBadger,3,Mon Jul 13 19:14:06 2015 UTC,They didn't have any more bombs to drop after Nagasaki.
Harmontown,3d3rvk,LarryMahnken,4,Mon Jul 13 20:22:55 2015 UTC,"Groves expected to have another bomb available on August 19th (10 days after Nagasaki), three more in September, three more in October.  The point is that the bombing of Nagasaki was done without orders from the President, because it wasn't considered any different than any other weapon.  They had been given the go-ahead to use atomic bombs, so they went ahead.  They weren't going to ask permission before each one, as they saw it they already had permission."
Harmontown,3d3rvk,SlackBadger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, however Groves cancelled the shipment of the core on the 13th. In regards to Nagasaki, Truman didn't issue the order that all future bombings had to be authorized by him until the 10th."
Harmontown,3d3rvk,LarryMahnken,3,Mon Jul 13 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I said.  They authorized the atom bomb, it was dropped on Hiroshima on the 6th, and then the military dropped a second on on Nagasaki without Presidential authorization on the 9th.  Truman immediately let the army know to not drop any more unless he said so on the 10th, Groves then cancelled the core shipment on the 13th.  You're not disagreeing with me."

Harmontown,3d3rvk,SlackBadger,2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely paraphrasing, and not sure if/where sarcasm comes in.  When asked by Jeff, ""You are Truman at the end of WWII and are asked, do we drop the bomb(s) on Japan?""  Spencer replied something that involved, ""DROP THE HAMMER.""  Along with a further explanation of how they weren't quitting and we needed to drop the bomb."
Harmontown,3d3rvk,hAND_OUT,5,Mon Jul 13 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"We've been feed the same bullshit line about why the bombs were dropped for the last 70 years. Japan was very close to surrendering before they were dropped, and ultimately chose to capitulate primarily because the Soviets had overrun Manchuria starting on 9 August.  The most probable reason why the US dropped the bombs was to show the Soviets that they had atomic weaponry and were willing to use it."
Harmontown,3d3rvk,SlackBadger,3,Mon Jul 13 20:32:30 2015 UTC,"There's also the argument that while the Emperor was ready (and attempted to) negotiate, the Japanese military command was in the game for the long haul.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_(film)  This film is a great re-enactment of the political decisions that lead up to the the dropping of the first bomb."
Harmontown,3d3rvk,autowikibot,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"There was an attempted coup d'etat on 14-15 Aug right before the Gyokuon-hōsō. The history of Aug 45 gets really confusing and messy, but I'm confident that there was no military need to use the bombs, nor that they were the major reason that Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration."

The three-hour film was made for television (Showtime Network) and evidently had no theatrical release, but is available on DVD for home viewing.  A combination of dramatisation, historical footage, and eyewitness interviews, the film alternates between documentary footage and the dramatic recreations. Both the dramatisations and most of the original footage are presented as sepia-toned images, serving to blur the distinction between them. The languages are English and Japanese, with subtitles, and the actors are largely Canadian and Japanese.

And jerking off. Gonna do some of that at some point, probably.   But mostly Rocket League. Most fun game I've played in years. When the servers are working well, I can't get enough."

Harmontown,3d2jea,BaldBeardyBastard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:33:50 2015 UTC,This game is getting mad hype. Is it seriously that good? What if I would only be playing it solo?
Harmontown,3d2jea,ecrone,2,Mon Jul 13 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"It's super fun.  I've had fun playing against bots, but it's definitely best as a multiplayer game. I haven't gotten into online yet, but it's some of the best local multiplayer fun I've had in a while."

Harmontown,3d2jea,Vet357,7,Mon Jul 13 02:33:55 2015 UTC,"Ho boy, you're in for a hell of a ride!   If you're looking for more games to play while listening to podcasts, these ones have gotten me through hundreds of episodes of stuff -  Euro Truck Simulator 2 (seriously, try it) FTL: Faster Than Light Spelunky Binding of Isaac: Rebirth Papers, Please (I recommend playing without podcasts for a while to get used to it, might be too consuming for podcasts early on) Rocket League (new staple, highly recommended) Any online poker games, I like PokerStars Terraria Broforce (The Expendabros is a free standalone expansion, so you can try that first) Just Cause 2 Kerbal Space Program    You've already got Hearthstone, which is a great one. I wish I could get into MTGO, but I spend enough on physical cards already.   Have fun. If you want suggestions for other podcasts to get to after you finish Harmontown to keep the laughs goin, I can put together a list of those, too."
Harmontown,3d2jea,Condawg,4,Mon Jul 13 04:05:26 2015 UTC,I listened to a whole bunch of Harmontown to FTL!  Also Civilization V is great for podcasts. Listened to many hours of WTF while playing that one

Tip to keep the costs down -- get your group into pauper! It gives everyone a level playing field and it's cheap as shit. My older brother plays legacy, he's got some fucking insane decks that cost him an embarrassing amount of money. He does well at tournaments, but at our Friday Night Magic it can be too much. Pauper keeps it fun for all."

Harmontown,3d2jea,Condawg,2,Mon Jul 13 05:21:11 2015 UTC,"Traffic++ and Extended Public Transport UI mods are literally game-changers - I'll be amazed if they're not just fully integrated into the base game in a future update. Plus if you want achievements (I do, cuz I'm a bloody achievement hunter idiot) then there's a mod for still-allowing-achievements-even-with-mods...  I've never played a city sim game in my life (well, Banished, but, that's a bit different...I think..?!) and I'm 50+ hours in and loving it..!!"
Harmontown,3d2jea,BaldBeardyBastard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:32:22 2015 UTC,"Good to know, I'll give 'em a look! Thanks for the tip.  Banished is way different for sure. Great game, though. Especially considering every single thing in that game was made by one person, down to the music. Very impressive, and he did very well with it.  You're lucky to have not played the latest Sim City. I mean, if it was your first city simulation game it might not have been such a big disappointment, but coming off the earlier games in the series it was a travesty. I have nothing good to say about that game, other than that the interface was nice. They fucked themselves hard, and the City: Skylines crew came in and damned near perfected the genre.   I paid full price for that game. Biggest disappointment I've ever had in a game. Even Watch Dogs was less of a let down."

Harmontown,3d2jea,BaldBeardyBastard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:01:51 2015 UTC,Nissa makes 4/4 when she flips and Liliana is pretty strong in limited and pretty easy to flip. Jace might be better in constructed but I'll split the difference with you on him.
Harmontown,3d2jea,BaldBeardyBastard,2,Mon Jul 13 05:15:59 2015 UTC,I agree with you but none of the new planeswalkers seem like game ending forces. I guess that's understandable since lore-wise  they are just becoming planeswalkers. I'm just kind of complaining that they aren't op.

Harmontown,3d2cfb,Vet357,18,Sun Jul 12 23:30:47 2015 UTC,"Just start from the beginning and take your time with it, trust me."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,ahintoflime,2,Mon Jul 13 00:52:33 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with this. It should be mentioned that a strict adherence to episode order is unnecessary, insofar as one is unconcerned about D&D spoilers. Considering OP mentioned watching the documentary, he/she could start with the episodes beginning after the tour as well as from the beginning and just go back and forth. I did something similar, I found Harmontown about 1/3rd of the way thru the tour and went back and forth from the beginning to the released tour episodes and back again. I ride the bus to work everyday so getting thru X amount of episodes is trivial."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,Riztonium,8,Mon Jul 13 08:58:07 2015 UTC,New fan here as well! I knew who Dan was from Community and I'm a big fan of Rick and Morty. Just happened to pop on the Harmontown documentary on Netflix a couple weeks ago and thought it was great! I checked out one show and instantly subbed to be able to watch the videos. I'm starting from the beginning and I'm only 5 episodes in. Just heard Spencer's first appearance. I've got a long way to go and I'm savoring it like a fine wine. I guess I identify with Dan being a 39 year old child of the 80's who is big into video games and a lot of nerdy culture in general. Next time the wife and I go to LA we definitely will be attending a show.
Harmontown,3d2cfb,timothydog76,2,Mon Jul 13 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome new Harmenian! This comment gave me an idea, it would be interesting to have a survey asking questions like how/when someone found Harmontown, where they're from, etc. I'd be interested to see the demographics of this sub/Harmontown."

Harmontown,3d2cfb,advancedman,4,Sun Jul 12 23:47:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say start from the first one, but if you really want a taste of the best take a look at this post."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,BaloneyFraise,4,Sun Jul 12 23:48:48 2015 UTC,"Start from the top. I recommend you find something you love to do that doesnt require reading, e.g. video games, drawing, whatever, and binge listen to it. I've actually listened to the entirety of Harmontown twice (I'm an illustrator, it lends itself well to podcasts).   I also highly recommend Justin Roilland's podcast if you love Rick & Morty."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,HoorayPizzaDay,2,Mon Jul 13 01:37:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks , Ill definitely start on Justin's pod when I get done with as much Harmontown as I can stand. And I feel you about doing something you love. I mostly play Hearthstone or Magic Online when I listen to pods."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,Riztonium,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:50:14 2015 UTC,I like to play Minecraft on my Vita while listening to Podcasts. I've hours upon hours to both.
Harmontown,3d2cfb,art_is_dumb,2,Mon Jul 13 09:01:13 2015 UTC,"It's so crazy how so many of us use Harmontown as a catalyst to creative endeavors. I can't get work on designing or printing shirts without it, this has been ongoing since the show's inception."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,Bonspiel13,3,Mon Jul 13 05:42:54 2015 UTC,I started from the beginning about a month ago I'm on #80. I just found that listening to the newer episodes I missed a lot of throwbacks.
Harmontown,3d2cfb,Riztonium,3,Mon Jul 13 00:04:19 2015 UTC,When you finally catch up I can almost guarantee you'll start back over. It happens to the best of us.

Harmontown,3d2cfb,MoistPockets,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"The first 25 episodes or so up to the first tour were incredible and I've listened to them multiple times. Definitely start at the first episode.  Later on, if the tour episodes don't do it for you, skip to the end of the tour."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,Redjobnuns,3,Mon Jul 13 01:51:47 2015 UTC,I feel that after watching the documentary I really wanna hear the insanity of the tour.

Harmontown,3d2cfb,Riztonium,2,Mon Jul 13 02:43:23 2015 UTC,Did not know. Now I have something else to buy...
Harmontown,3d2cfb,BaldBeardyBastard,4,Mon Jul 13 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"I just finished listening to every podcast they have up on Podcast Republic. While there are a few shitty episodes here and there, I would honestly recommend starting from the beginning and listening to them all. There's a lot of progression and content that builds up over the episodes, and it's not like it's a written show with 'finale' style climaxes. Just listen to them all. Side note; I miss D&D so much."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,ConorNutt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about D&D. They're doing a great job with Shadow Run but it just doesn't scratch that itch like D&D, I feel like it lends itself more easily to whimsy and flights of fancy. I'm hoping Harmon Quest can adequately fill that void."
Harmontown,3d2cfb,Riztonium,2,Mon Jul 13 09:03:33 2015 UTC,"2 months ago I started at Episode one.   I'm up to Episode 99 and still going strong..!

For me it's hard to read them as ancient Toltec wisdom and fundamental truths then see the ""oh yeah and this one too"" in the jacket. It if we're key, then subsequent editions of the four agreements would include all five.  Or it could just be a way to sell more self help books."

Note that for this project they would do a new D&D campaign especially for this, not just repurpose the campaign in Harmontown. Thats why the characters on the poster are different from what you've heard on the podcast.  This was all first mentioned about a year ago, maybe longer. Spencer one time mentioned that the project was dead because they didn't find a network to buy it. But now... that has suddenly and miraculously changed.  Does that catch you up? :)"

Harmontown,3cuhtf,HatesRedditors,8,Sat Jul 11 03:33:15 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly. I can't remember if Dan was talking about it on the podcast or an interview, but I heard him say once that Adult Swim wanted more than a ten episode season of Rick and Morty, but that Dan and whoever else negotiates it felt that Justin Roiland was already maxed out making ten episodes because of the amount of work that goes into each one.  So, you have a network clamouring for more content and a production company that has another property on hand. Not hard to see how that could lead to something.  Or, maybe it happened in some completely different way. As Spencer says, ""who knows, man."""

Harmontown,3cwatr,HalpTheFan,5,Sat Jul 11 08:55:56 2015 UTC,"I'm based out of Chicago, so I'm probably not the best person to answer questions about LA. But I travel there frequently, so I do have some advice:  I've used Uber the last dozen times I've been there rather than renting a car. Unless you're traveling constantly, this works out to be a lot less money than renting. The prices you get quoted on car rental places don't include things like taxes, insurance, gas, etc. A lot of LA has very expensive parking, and it's getting rare to find a hotel that lets you park for free at night. Look into services like Uber, or Lyft instead. Public transportation is also an option, but due to how large LA is, it's complicated and slow. It is cheaper than Uber though.  Even if you have a Nerdmelt membership, arrive early. Shows can sell out, and it's not always clear who gets priority when this happens.  If you're into surreal, The Museum of Jurassic Technology is a great way to spend a few hours looking at things that will confuse you. Time Travel Mart is also fun.  If you want to interview the cast, the best way of reaching them usually is Twitter. Spencer and Dustin check in here on Reddit, Dan/Jeff/Erin don't often. Even if you don't reach them before the show, many (but not all) shows they'll hang out afterwards if you're patient. I'm generally not at shows (I live way too far away), but if I happen to be there that weekend I'll make sure I say hi."
Harmontown,3cwatr,kevinday,2,Sat Jul 11 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, Kevin. So sorry I assumed you were based in LA.   I will be using Uber and Lyft. I plan on hanging out mainly in West Hollywood unless something strikes my fancy.   I will definitely be there early. Probably load up my phone with podcasts from my home country, awkwardly say hi to people in line and I imagine peeps with tix will get priority on the night.   I will definitely tweet them in a few weeks, I know that they don't frequent the subreddit that often, but I thought to tag them regardless. I plan on talking to them afterwards and speaking with Dan and maybe getting him to sign a few things and ask him if he's free at any point in the next fortnight to interview him, but I know he'll be busy doing stuff obviously.   Thank you so much for getting back to me :)"
Harmontown,3cwatr,thavirg,3,Sun Jul 12 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"Hey yo!  Sorry I delayed responding to your message awhile back... main thing right now is potential trips (for me) happening in that same time window.  As the next month or two rolls by, I'll have clarity there, though.  Regarding your other questions:  1) Given your budget, I think money will be the determining factor here.  Think you mentioned ~10 days or so, and it'll be easy (if not inevitable) to average $100/night around that area.  If you want to get closer to the $500 figure, you need to find some couch surfing options.  2) I've lived around SoCal for the last ~10 years, so my behavior isn't typical for a traveler.  When I've hosted out-of-town friends, though, a few things come to mind: Disneyland, museums (there are lots, and some great ones!), parks (Huntington Gardens), hiking (lots of mountains around the area, Hollywood sign), beaches (I can point out good/bad beaches for ya), food/drink (what sorts of food do you like? you a coffee fan?), architecture.  3-4) Los Angeles is absolutely insanely huge and has soooo many different parts to it.  The metro and public transit are not very great.  Uber is an option.  Really, L.A. works best if you have a car.  I understand your budget would disagree with this, but if you can rent a car for 1-2 days of the trip, it's something to think about (might make certain things more realistic).  As far as interviewing the cast, I don't have a great feeling for how easy that'll be.  /u/kevinday is highly responsive on the sub, though, and I bet he could be great help in figuring out what's possible.  Your best bet to make small talk, share a few words, etc., though, would be to catch the gang right after a show (everyone sorta mingles for a few minutes, except Dan who often disappears (from my perspective, at least))."

Erin and Emily were all like why don't you get up there and talk for an hour (and Dan eventually was all like ""Why not two?"").  Jeff was at the bar that night, and he jumped in to kind of keep Dan on topic and give him someone to play off of (they had been friends for years, previously, having met at some improv competition, IIRC).  It's not standup.  It has its roots in improv, and Dan, Jeff, and Erin all have a heavy background in that.  Before it was a podcast, it was just a show in the back of a comic book store where Dan ranted about whatever was on his mind (and it sometimes leaked into the press and got him into trouble).

He still can't believe people are there, it seems. Willing to shell out cold hard cash to listen to him pontificate and fool around and rap badly. He knows he's not a Socratic philosopher dispensing wisdom, so he's perfectly at ease bringing people up on stage and forcing egalitarianism on them.

I don't expect everyone to ""get"" or even like Harmontown. I have a lot of friends and I only recommend it to a few of them.   Here's why: You really need to have an idea of what it means to be an outsider to appreciate the vibe of the show. Actually, here's what Harmontown is about - it's a celebration of being just outside of the ""cool society"". It's edifying the nerd. It's justifying your lack of interest in sports and glorifying being free from tyrannical assholery.   If you don't relate to any of that. If you're a status quo person - then the real message of Harmontown may just go right over your head. Hopefully not.   EDIT - Downvote for what? How is this not exactly what Harmontown is about?

Just because you don't get it, doesn't make you automatically status quo.   The truth is, Harmontown IS for everybody but the caveat is that many people would gleefully opt out of that experience because it appeals to a certain type of individual. Harmon has said it many times during the tour ""there is a TYPE of individual  that shows up to these shows and calls themself a Harmenian"". So then, we must admit to ourselves that, in spirit, it is for everybody but, in reality, everybody does not get it.

Harmontown,3c3rqc,deepit6431,2,Sat Jul 4 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"Hi. I didn’t initially have a strong opinion in the matter, but the idea of the powerful taking advantage of those weaker than them seemed like an issue in Harmontown’s wheelhouse, and worth drawing attention to.  After some reading, the thing that did bother me personally was the individual accounts of three reddit employees;  /u/chooter, /u/Dacvak, and u/ukickme444 being fired in less than stellar circumstances.  Not all details are available, so you can take those stories with however many grains of salt you like.  But one incident is a data point, three is a trend . . .  I think reddit is going through a culture change on the administrative side as they try to monetize the site, and some of that is filtering down to the users.  The warm and fuzzy atmosphere that attracted some of us is dissipating, causing dissatisfaction.  Most of that won’t affect /r/Harmontown, so if you want to remain ignorant of larger events happening on the site, you shouldn’t have a problem doing that.  I don’t think anyone on this subreddit became a mod for the power and glory of it, and /r/Harmontown largely regulates itself because of the quality of the people it attracts.  A 24 hour “dark period” on a Friday seemed like a fairly innocuous action with some potential to raise awareness, and little downside.  I think largely individuals will carry their own hostility and drama with them wherever they go - reacting according to their nature regardless of what happens.  But if you’re worried about /r/Harmontown changing in any drastic form, don’t be.  It’s ultimately Adam’s playground, I’m just one of several caretakers donating a small amount of my time, trying to be responsive to the individuals that come here for discussion."
Harmontown,3c3rqc,deepit6431,2,Sun Jul 5 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your concerns and motivations, and your idea of reddit's trajectory and all that's wrong with it. I disagree with the actual act of taking this sub down, but then I disagree with doing things purely on principle in general.   But hey, my actual point is, I don't care either way. I just don't want any hostility here from any side. Now that we're back, let's all be friends please."

Harmontown,3c3rqc,odduckSG,4,Sun Jul 5 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, no, just very familiar with how difference of opinion works out on reddit. Most of it, including this subreddit, is prone to incredible hostility and bitterness towards the nicest people (look at how Erin was treated here not long ago).  I genuinely believe we're better than that, and I want us to be a nice, welcoming place beyond anything else. If that means ignoring larger issues that this community is not directly concerned with, so be it.   But of course, that's just my opinion :)."

Look, the nature of systems is that they become oppressive. That's not to say that we don't need systems, just that those systems will eventually turn against people.  In the case of Reddit, it's an example of what happens when a system attempts to monetize people. You start of as a community driven site, reflecting the user base. Eventually it needs money to operate. It finds the money, and chugs along for a bit. Eventually the bill becomes due, and the only way to pay back that money is to sell the users.  Shit. There I go stepping into the drama. Screw that. Just saying that I appreciate the mods sticking up for the workers as opposed to the management. Using the Harmon principle of ""root against the people who have the guns"", I support the people rioting over the people losing money.  The subreddit went dark in support of that, and I'm applauding them for it. Nothing more."

All I've seen is ""the AMA lady got fired, so let's protest how much Ellen Pao sucks in an extra-big way now""....I haven't seen a legitimate reason to protest the firing other than seemingly baseless assumptions  Like, I dunno how relevant this is, but less than a week ago I saw a big post somewhere complaining that the AMA-assistant fakes questions that allow the person doing the AMA to talk whatever they're promoting"
Harmontown,3c3rqc,The3rdCraigRobinson,4,Sat Jul 4 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"AMA lady (Victoria Taylor) was fired without any heads up to the various mod teams that relied on her to run AMAs. Mods resented having the rug pulled out from under them, and say it's pretty typical of how the admins run this site. They claim they've been mostly unsupported by the admin team, with grievances such as official moderation tools being so outdated that most subs resort to third-party tools. They think it's unacceptable that they do so much important unpaid work with so little admin support/communication.   ...the AMA-assistant fakes questions that allow the person doing the AMA to talk whatever they're promoting   The more likely scenario is this happening more often without Victoria involved. The infamous Rampart AMA and the fake Morgan Freeman AMA occurred without her involvement, if I have that right.  More on-topic questions and agents/reps behind the keyboard fit the narrative of monetizing AMAs, but I think that's more conspiracy right now. Lack of support for the mod teams is the more grounded thing to be salty about."

Harmontown,3c3rqc,thehollowman84,3,Sat Jul 4 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"To use your analogy, imagine you've been going to the bar attached to that restaurant for years. While the restaurant has been trying to cater to as many people as possible, including schmoozing celebrity guests, the bar has stayed largely unchanged. Management doesn't really care about the bar because it's smaller and more self-sufficient, plus they have to put all their focus on the restaurant side of the business.   Then the waitress gets fired. It's a shame, certainly, but it doesn't affect you in the least. Maybe you even feel like inviting celebrities was bringing in too many patrons from that Youtube Bistro across the street. Maybe you even feel like the restaurant is, to use a phrase, ""a monument to mediocrity."" So when people in the restaurant start talking about boycotting and flipping chairs, you don't pay much attention. Good for them for looking after their own.  But when they start coming into the bar, asking ""Why hasn't the bar closed in solidarity"", threatening to burn down the entire building, and saying repulsive and vile things about the management, it gets pretty annoying. Especially since all this madness was started because one person was fired,  so it's clear that nobody had any sort of plan in place for this eventuality except to throw a fit.  You liken reddit to the moon colony earlier, but I can't disagree more. I don't have anything in common with the users of r/ama and r/pics except by the most superficial comparisons. I don't feel a sense of solidarity when I browse r/funny or r/askreddit. I do feel that way when I browse r/harmontown, my local subs, and my hobby subs. The subs that are much smaller and easier to moderate, because the thing is the larger subreddits are always going to be difficult to manage. And it's impossible to not feel like this whole situation is due to decisions by admins and mods to overbloat the default subs beyond their ability to control them, so asking the smaller subs (the only part of reddit with an actual sense of community beyond knowing the internets inside jokes), asking them to go down for that seems kind of a shitty thing to do."
Harmontown,3c3rqc,odduckSG,2,Sat Jul 4 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like your metaphor is missing some key pieces....people hated the CEO months before the waitress was fired...the rest of the staff, along with some that didn't even know the waitress, spend a day preventing customers from entering and/or sitting at their favorite tables (lol or w/e applies best here)...and, instead of leaving, everybody is still sitting in the restaurant complaining about the restaurant  I mean, no offense, but that didn't really tell me much that I didn't already know: People hate Ellen Pao even more now for firing a beloved AMA person  /u/Mozadus gave a pretty substantive answer. I didn't know there're so many grievances between the mods & the admins and that that was the reason behind ""black out"" aspect of the protest. Knowing it's not specifically about Pao/Victoria Taylor getting fired puts it in a totally different perspective for me"

Harmontown,3bxzia,m_busuttil,30,Fri Jul 3 02:15:22 2015 UTC,I guess we can announce it. Huh. Would've been nice to let me know. >_<
Harmontown,3bxzia,thesixler,2,Fri Jul 3 14:58:39 2015 UTC,Nobody tells me nothing.
Harmontown,3bxzia,Time_Fox,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Remind the animators that ""Everyone in this world is black, it just doesn't bear mentioning most of the time."""
Harmontown,3bxzia,kinghadbar,15,Sat Jul 11 17:51:16 2015 UTC,Yes!!!
Harmontown,3bxzia,advancedman,17,Fri Jul 3 02:52:55 2015 UTC,it's happening
Harmontown,3bxzia,ohgymod,7,Fri Jul 3 04:13:37 2015 UTC,I love that that giant dancing baby is also capable of Community and Rick and Morty.
Harmontown,3bxzia,Count_Critic,5,Fri Jul 3 05:07:17 2015 UTC,Yep
Harmontown,3bxzia,ohgymod,3,Fri Jul 3 06:53:37 2015 UTC,Is... is that the dancing baby dance? That's amazing.
Harmontown,3bxzia,ohgymod,5,Fri Jul 3 05:47:15 2015 UTC,why yes. yes it it
Harmontown,3bxzia,N4th4niel,5,Fri Jul 3 06:50:31 2015 UTC,If you watch this whilst listening to classical music he seems like the happiest conductor ever.
Harmontown,3bxzia,Obscurist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:07:44 2015 UTC,Will you please link me to the video this came from?
Harmontown,3bxzia,ohgymod,4,Fri Jul 3 07:21:57 2015 UTC,This should work
Harmontown,3bxzia,Obscurist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:39:54 2015 UTC,You are the best.
Harmontown,3bxzia,SnakeOilGhost,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:40:14 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs to go ahead and listen to that there video and watch this here gif, and just let your stress float away."
Harmontown,3bxzia,lightningstef,6,Fri Jul 3 12:09:53 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this when watching Titansgrave (the Wil Wheaton fronted tabletop rpg show that just started on Geek and Sundry) and thinking about how much more fun D&D/Shadowrun is on Harmontown, and then how it was a shame that Harmonquest seemed to have disappeared.  Really happy that it's going to happen!"
Harmontown,3bxzia,thesixler,5,Fri Jul 3 08:53:23 2015 UTC,"Good to hear wheaton's thing is boring, I was worried about it but also I heard rumors of dwarves with laser guns so I was like laaame"
Harmontown,3bxzia,Bonspiel13,3,Fri Jul 3 15:00:01 2015 UTC,Oooooh is this why Erin was collecting our favourite moments? I'm stoked!
Harmontown,3bxzia,Time_Fox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:51:54 2015 UTC,I didn't see that press release- thanks for posting it. I almost forgot about Sunday's episode!
Harmontown,3bxzia,BaloneyFraise,0,Tue Jul 7 18:29:32 2015 UTC,I better hurry the fuck up with my project then.
Harmontown,3by3lo,HalpTheFan,8,Fri Jul 3 02:51:25 2015 UTC,Donald needs to get on harmontown before the series premiere of his new show on fx.
Harmontown,3by3lo,theforman_,10,Sun Jul 5 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"Second time Dan has used a Donald joke (the other recent one being ""weirdest boner""). I guess he really was Dan's favorite."
Harmontown,3bu1qu,BrainCuddles,47,Thu Jul 2 03:47:50 2015 UTC,I missed Kumail. So much.
Harmontown,3bu1qu,Pantstown,21,Thu Jul 2 06:25:17 2015 UTC,I agree completely. Emily also needs her own Harmontown-like show.
Harmontown,3bu1qu,annoyinglyclever,8,Thu Jul 2 10:23:43 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I would listen to that in a heartbeat.
Harmontown,3bu1qu,totoroller,7,Fri Jul 3 03:31:14 2015 UTC,And Paget. Tons more Paget.
Harmontown,3bu1qu,gloamingchild,5,Fri Jul 3 02:17:20 2015 UTC,I would also like it if Kumail was on the X-files Files podcast more often
Harmontown,3bu1qu,Everything_and_More,11,Thu Jul 2 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"OH my god, the podcast just dropped and now you're telling me Kumail's in it. This is going to be the best commute home ever."
Harmontown,3bu1qu,desultir,10,Thu Jul 2 06:29:05 2015 UTC,"If you are into video games, indoor kids is great. Just them being awesome and talking about gaming."
Harmontown,3bu1qu,ico59,6,Thu Jul 2 10:38:20 2015 UTC,I haven't really been able to get into indoor kids I think it's because I have only played a fraction of the games they like
Harmontown,3bu1qu,killermoose25,5,Thu Jul 2 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"They generally talk about a lot more than just games. Movies, TV, books, comics, current events. If it's been awhile since you tried it out it might be worth picking one with a guest you like and listening."
Harmontown,3bu1qu,ecrone,3,Thu Jul 2 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yea I listened to the first three and then just kind of lost interest , I'll look through them and give it another shot"
Harmontown,3bu1qu,killermoose25,4,Thu Jul 2 15:22:38 2015 UTC,I would recommend episodes with Jordan Morris. They usually cover a wide breadth of topics and they are all very funny together.
Harmontown,3bu1qu,ecrone,2,Thu Jul 2 16:46:28 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll check it out once I finish wade and willie's pod casts
Harmontown,3bu1qu,killermoose25,2,Thu Jul 2 17:14:27 2015 UTC,Any particularly memorable episodes you (or anyone) might recommend?
Harmontown,3bu1qu,professionalecho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"Harmon and Spencer have both been on so those might be good ones for Harmontown fans to start out with.   I think Jordan Morris has been on one or more ""Year in Review"" episode so that's fun because they talk about all sorts of stuff. Also the episode ""Tuna Lap"" with Jordan is a very funny one.   ""Sim Life"" with Thomas Middleditch is a good one because he is hilarious and talks about a whole unique style of sim gaming I was totally unaware of.   Enjoy! It's one of my fav podcasts, Kumail and Emily are great people."
Harmontown,3bu1qu,ecrone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:57:29 2015 UTC,weirdly I have played nearly non of the games and still enjoy it.
Harmontown,3bu1qu,Tift,2,Thu Jul 2 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"Same here, and when I do care about a game they never seem to mention it, like the E3 episode I was so excited to hear their reactions to Fallout 4 and nothing.  I still loved the episode, but it's just funny that they never seem to be interested in the same games I'm into."
Harmontown,3bu1qu,HatesRedditors,5,Fri Jul 3 06:02:27 2015 UTC,"They were both on @midnight Monday too, they're so adorable!"
Harmontown,3btd7w,Lostathome4040,2,Thu Jul 2 00:02:13 2015 UTC,I can't seem to find the actual podcast.  It's just pictures and youtube links.    Edit: It's there now.
Harmontown,3btd7w,chiokjarse,2,Thu Jul 2 00:29:55 2015 UTC,Good discussion.  Confirmed lengthy hiatus for community at least.
Harmontown,3btd7w,bigdirkmalone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:47:54 2015 UTC,Kinda interesting that Dan said he'd like to collaborate with Christopher Nolan considering he wasn't that into Inception/DKR (around min 50-ish)
