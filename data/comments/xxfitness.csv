I've said it to my friend who insisted I had lost enough weight when I was half way to my goal, to a stranger who said my hair would be nicer down. It's versatile, your tone can make it as light hearted and rude as you want.   Or maybe it would be best to talk to him about your goals. Sometimes people make remarks, or have opinions, that they have never really thought about. That they've never had to think about. Your big brother obviously means the world to you. If he knew you were doing something that made you happier in your body, healthier and stronger that he would still be negative about it?

Some guys really don't like the look of girls being too muscular, too skinny, too fat, too tall...you get the point. Lots of women do the same thing. We're sexual creatures are there are things that turn us off and on. I think your brother had absolutely no tact in how he expressed his opinion and it was pretty rude but your his sister and he probably just feels really comfortable letting his guard down and letting more things get through the filter than he normally would. I mean if y'all were having a conversation and he said, ""Ya know, buff girls just don't really do anything for me personally"" probably wouldn't have stung so much.   There will always be guys that aren't attracted to whatever look you have going on but on the flip side there are guys out there who are going to love it. This is your brother though.

It takes being serious with a structured bulking program and heavy training to look like a body builder in competition. Just lifting weights is not going to achieve the look he's thinking of. Many of the u.s. olympic weight lifters aren't that buff looking and they can power lift your brother. He needs to calm his titties and shut up. :P

You can't change his tastes and truly most people find female bodybuilding bodies an acquired taste, to put it nicely, so he is just being a normal guy.  Another important thing is that just doing some weight lifting is not going to bulk up a women like hulk. Females do not bulk up like men because we lack the hormones.    So keep up with your weight training, and try not to be discouraged or spite your brother just because he casually decided to share his honest opinion about something to his sister."

My boyfriend was the most scared of me getting big - and now he thinks I'm more attractive than ever. The whole thing about women getting super buff is more of an urban myth than anything.

Reading online, people seem divided between 'don't workout' and 'workout, I set a new PR when I'm tired.'  Should I reduce the effort of my workouts, take more rest in between sets, or take more rest days? Any advice would be welcome!"
xxfitness,3e24hb,boxwagon,23,Tue Jul 21 14:07:27 2015 UTC,Are you eating enough?  Faint and dizzy sounds more like a food issue than a sleep issue if you're getting 6-7 hours a night.

xxfitness,3e24hb,boxwagon,8,Tue Jul 21 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"That would do it!  1200 is really low and is probably what's causing you to feel fuzzy and tired all the time.  1450-1550 still sounds pretty low, you might want to try going higher than that.  If you want to gain strength and build muscle you should (according to the USDA ""supertracker"") be eating closer to 2100 calories."
xxfitness,3e24hb,Gingerdyke,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"This. You can gain strength and build some muscle at a caloric deficit, but it isn't easy and you won't be winning an iron woman competition. That's why the bulk and cut are pretty traditional--trying to do them at the same time is so ineffective, especially once you get past the noobie stage."

Thank you for your advice, I really do appreciate it!"
xxfitness,3e24hb,boxwagon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:06 2015 UTC,Not a dietitian or nutritionist or anything BUT.

xxfitness,3e24hb,Mozie23,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Your legs aren't necessarily supposed to be sore with C25K.  You are developing your cardio endurance so you can run continuously without having to walk to catch your breath.  Once you can run a 5k without stopping, then you can work on other types of run sessions that will build your leg strength (intervals, hill training, etc).  Or, you can do something like a spin class in addition to running if you want to work on your legs."
xxfitness,3e24hb,notoriousrdc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"This is a feature, not a bug! In general, your legs shouldn't be sore from running. Unless you're training for short sprint distances, you're going to want to be doing the majority of your runs at ""easy"" (can carry on a conversation, doesn't feel like you're pushing yourself) pace, and even your speed workouts and long runs shouldn't regularly leave you in pain. Wobbly and uncomfortable, yes. Pain, no. After your first few runs (which can result in DOMS), soreness caused by non-race runs is generally a sign that you're pushing yourself too hard (unless you decide to go for running marathon-or-longer distances, which are a whole other kettle of fish).  Also, if you're not already subbed, I highly recommend /r/c25k. I found the community really supportive back when I first started running."

I usually have to wet my hair just a bit to comb it out in the morning and tie it up in a bun or ponytail-braid to keep it out of my face while I workout. Unfortunately it becomes very problematic for days where I wanna do bench and my bun just keeps on pushing my head in all different directions.

Most shampoos have shit in it that dries your hair out (or use no poo shampoos). Brushing can break and damage your hair. Use deep conditioning treatments/warm olive oil/other stuff to moisten and condition it. Frizz happens when you hair is dry.   Main thing, you're at the gym, it doesn't matter how you look.

For preserving strength on a cut, a lot of it depends on how drastic of a cut you're doing, what level of strength you're at (do you still have plenty of noob gains left?), and how your recovery goes.  Moving to an intermediate program, even while cutting, might be beneficial for the slower progression that's built in."

xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,4,Tue Jul 21 17:19:42 2015 UTC,"Pull ups and push ups... do you start working on them to get better or are there other ways to train for them before you fall on your face?   I'm doing starting strength and am F/24/5'10"" SW:233 CW:195 GW:160 or BF% when I figure out how to correctly measure it. I'm worried it might be too soon to start with this body weight exercise but the post about pull ups really opened my eyes.   What do you all think? Any personal experience with this?"
xxfitness,3e24hb,frak8757,6,Tue Jul 21 13:17:49 2015 UTC,"won't know until you try! And you can do modified variations...   pushups against wall/bench/box/etc., progressively using a lower surface until you are doing them on the floor. This is actually a really good use of the smith machine, you can set the bar at whatever height you want and do pushups on it.  For pullups, used resistance bands for assistance. As you get stronger, use a weaker resistance band to provide less resistance."
xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention that I currently have to do a push up in yoga during the flow in chataranga. I do modified on my knees because my hips tend to sag otherwise. I also just drop to my chest by the last 6 inches because I can't maintain the push up to the ground. I've noticed an increase in stamina and strength in my push ups from Starting Strength. But I really want to do a real one!   And I haven't attempted pull ups since we were forced to do them in middle school -- oh, wait, just remembered grabbing the bar at the gym and maybe lifting my toes an inch of the ground with a lot of strain, definitely need help to bring my chin above the bar! How would I use the resistance band in this case? Is it while I'm in a pull up position or before even starting to try?   Also, thank you for your answer!"
xxfitness,3e24hb,frak8757,4,Tue Jul 21 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"this image will explain it better than I could Basically, loop the band over the bar and through itself to secure, then put either your foot (for more assistance) or your knee (for less assistance) through the other end of the band. Then grab the bar and do pullups! The band will lighten the load.  As for pushups, dropping to your knees in yoga class makes sense, but to train them to get better at them I would definitely do incline pushups (on wall, bench, etc.) instead of knee pushups... they imitate the body position of a full pushup better so you will build the core strength to keep your hips from sagging."
xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:56 2015 UTC,"Whoa! Awesome, thank you!! This is incredibly helpful."
xxfitness,3e24hb,frak8757,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"no problem, glad to help!"
xxfitness,3e24hb,MCHammerCurls,3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"I also just drop to my chest by the last 6 inches because I can't maintain the push up to the ground.   Noooo bad chaturanga!  One of my old yoga teachers had that as a pet peeve and I can still hear her voice trying to correct the class.  Like /u/frak8757 mentions, work on your incline pushups outside of yoga class but keep your chaturanga in mind.  If you are practicing them against a counter, for example, keep your elbows tucked, lower slowly, and try to hover for a count or two before finishing the movement and pushing back up.  Similarly, you can work on a plank variation in this position, holding slightly above the floor and trying to increase your time as you would with a straight arm plank or one on your elbows."
xxfitness,3e24hb,kaloryth,4,Tue Jul 21 15:22:04 2015 UTC,So /u/Antranik who makes great bodyweight youtube videos and is a mod over at /r/bodyweightfitness consistently advocates not using knee push ups as a progression towards regular push ups. The reason is that knee push ups do not activate your core and do not force you to stabilize yourself in the same manner as extending towards your toes. Practicing on an incline will train the full form that will be required for regular push ups.  His video here explains proper push up form. If you go halfway through he starts showing proper form on an incline (his bathroom counter) for beginners who cannot do a normal push up.
xxfitness,3e24hb,rengawhm,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:54 2015 UTC,For pull ups I have been using bands and haven't seen any improvements.. But then I tried negative pull ups! They're a bitch and really hard but they definitely progressed me further in a short time than the bands have!!

xxfitness,3e24hb,hellnokitty86,7,Tue Jul 21 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"I just started the Stronglifts 5x5 program yesterday. I know it's suppose to help with strength but does it help any with weight loss? I am 5'6"" 174lbs and looking to drop ~30lbs. I am thinking about adding cardio to the program or should I just do it as is?"
xxfitness,3e24hb,amyflora,10,Tue Jul 21 14:30:43 2015 UTC,As long as you are eating fewer calories than you are burning you will lose weight. I have done Stronglifts and lost about 20 pounds since August. If you'd like to speed up the process cardio can help you burn more calories and improve your overall cardiovascular health!
xxfitness,3e24hb,mahi-mahi,5,Tue Jul 21 14:44:48 2015 UTC,"Weight loss is mostly through diet so do make sure that's in check. SL will help because adding muscle mass = you will be burning more calories at rest. You don't have to do cardio, but it cannot hurt either. (I broke through a weight loss plateau at 170lb when I started SL, but then started counting calories to make sure I kept losing weight). Understand though that if you are cutting calories, your lifts will stall eventually but that's okay :) if your primary goal is to lose fat, keep cutting and lifting as heavy as you can so you shed the fat and keep the muscle you have!"
xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,5,Tue Jul 21 14:47:14 2015 UTC,"Take a peek at /r/loseit's FAQ. It explains all the ins and outs of healthy weight loss. Weight lifting can help, but not enough to make up for overeating (i.e. you can't outrun a bad diet). Muscles require more calories to maintain, even at rest (which is why some people simplistically state that muscle increases your metabolism), but it's still not enough to create much of a calorie deficit. Doing cardio will burn more per hour than lifting and will help but it's the calorie deficit that really matters."

I'm in the 16-19% box and don't relate to those tradeoffs; it's easy for me to maintain here. So don't let the chart put you off a lower bf% goal if you really want one!"
xxfitness,3e24hb,Sugarcomet,3,Tue Jul 21 16:46:17 2015 UTC,Thank you! How often do you work out in order to maintain that body fat? (I'm very curious to here anecdotes from people in lower body fat categories!)
xxfitness,3e24hb,WorstDogEver,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"I was around 20% bf without much effort, basically practicing intuitive eating while trying to limit sugar and processed foods and eat more protein when I can. To get lower fat and more muscle, I started StrongLifts, which meant maybe 60-90 mins at the gym 3-4x a week at first. (I work out with a partner though. I think it's way faster if you're not having to switch weights in between sets.) Now it's more like 1-3x of gym a week. I throw in random yoga and Barre classes for fun when possible. I do what I can and try not to worry about anything too much.   Also, my low bf% is also helped by the fact that I'm flat chested. ;) At least that's good for something! I save so much on sports bras, lol."
xxfitness,3e24hb,Sugarcomet,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:09 2015 UTC,Ah thank you for your response! It's great to know that once you get to a lower body fat you can maintain without going to the gym everyday! Also I really enjoy fitness classes so I'm glad that I can add them in as well!  Haha I'm quite jealous. Right now I'm pretty big chested and although I'll hopefully lose quite a bit of that when I get down to my goal I think I'll still have to wear those crazy tight sports bras!!
xxfitness,3e24hb,LGoldGirl,6,Tue Jul 21 19:47:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand the question.... Are you asking how hard it is to be sub 25% body fat?
xxfitness,3e24hb,Sugarcomet,3,Tue Jul 21 12:08:28 2015 UTC,I guess I mean would you have to be at the point where you would be considered an athelite or exceptionally fit in order to get to that level?
xxfitness,3e24hb,LGoldGirl,13,Tue Jul 21 13:00:37 2015 UTC,"Of body fat? No. 25% is a pretty easily attained body fat. You can do that by working out consistently, and eating at a recomp level (just slightly below maintenance).  Heck, I haven't even found 20-21% to be that difficult/ strenuous to obtain and maintain.   My original question still stands though. Are you talking about body fat? Your question doesn't actually make it clear what you're talking about."
xxfitness,3e24hb,Sugarcomet,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:23 2015 UTC,Oh sorry! Yes was talking about body fat. Sorry that my question wasn't clear! It's great to hear that lower isn't too difficult to maintain as well. I have heard people complaining about how difficult it is to get to a lower body fat so I wasn't sure what would be required in order to get there.
xxfitness,3e24hb,LGoldGirl,7,Tue Jul 21 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"It's okay... I just wanted to make sure we weren't talking about BMI (which is a number I generally don't like anyway).  I generally suggest going about things slowly/ gradually. Give up processed sugars, all soda (even diet), fruit juices, and other drinks that have calories, start paying attention to your macros, and focus on eating about 100-200 under maintenance, while also training (including strength training). Your weight loss will be slower, but you'll still be able to build muscle, as you burn fat, so your body composition will change for the better in 2 ways (more muscle mass and less fat)."
xxfitness,3e24hb,Sugarcomet,4,Tue Jul 21 13:27:04 2015 UTC,Thank you! When I've gotten fitter in the past I've focused almost completely on weight loss so I was unsure of what I would need to do differently this time to ensure I would lose body fat as well. Thank you so much for your help!
xxfitness,3e24hb,fluorowhore,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:56 2015 UTC,Oh no. I mean take this with a grain of salt as I've always been thin but I maintain around 23ish% bf with minimal effort. If I hit the gym regularly I drop below 20 pretty fast.
xxfitness,3e24hb,peeweeGmagee,4,Tue Jul 21 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what you're starting out with, but just know IT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT POSSIBLE. Just takes time. Focus on eating well, lifting weights, running, and playing sports, and your body will strengthen and the fat will melt away.   And the further away you are from that percentage, the easier it is to lose the first pounds!   Good luck!"
xxfitness,3e24hb,Sugarcomet,3,Tue Jul 21 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Any other time I've lost weight I've been focusing almost completely on losing pounds from the scale but not really caring if my body fat % went down with the numbers or not. It feels a bit daunting to be starting with a different goal, especially since I've often read of people who have lost weight but still have a very high body fat content."
xxfitness,3e24hb,kaloryth,3,Tue Jul 21 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I started at, but I was at the top of my healthy BMI range when I started consistently doing a bodyweight routine near the end of January this year. I would say now that I'm around 25% bodyfat. I did this through recomp because I do not like counting calories."
xxfitness,3e24hb,Sugarcomet,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:44 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply! I still have a good bit of weight to lose as well so I think sadly my progress will be slower but it's great to know it's so doable! Very motivating.

xxfitness,3e24hb,MassivelyMini,6,Tue Jul 21 12:55:58 2015 UTC,Either see if the gym has them or invest in a squat sponge to use. Or you could wrap a yoga mat around the bar.

xxfitness,3e24hb,whenshesatwork,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:24 2015 UTC,Rolled up towel is good for a while but eventually when you get to a higher weight you will want to invest in a foam pad like the other ladies have suggested. When that weight is though is sort of up to you.

xxfitness,3e24hb,mariahsnow,6,Tue Jul 21 16:04:22 2015 UTC,Your squat depth is dependent on your flexibility and your anatomy. Some people just can't squat to parallel and that's ok. Start by working on box squats just so you get the feeling of sitting back into the hips really ingrained into your mind and that should help with form.

Find a way to do an open water swim, if you haven't already.  There's a big difference between swimming in a pool and swimming in a lake.  If you're going to wear a wetsuit then train in it as often as you can.  Body Glide is your best friend.  Use it wherever your outfit might rub.  It also helps to get your wetsuit off.  Use body glide on your ankles, calves, shins and over your knees before putting on your wetsuit.  Don't use Pam.  On race day, walk the transition area so you know where to enter/exit for each portion of the race and how to find your stuff/where your rack is.  Add some bricks into your training so you know what it feels like to do a swim and then get on the bike wet.  Also get used to running off the bike.  I used to do 10 to 20 minute run after at least one bike ride every week, especially my long ones.  Put on sunscreen all over your body in the morning before you leave the house and then reapply before the race.  Know how to change a flat tire.  Nothing will ruin your race faster than a flat that you can't fix.  If you've done the training, then relax about everything else.  The hay is in the barn, so to speak.  Just have fun with it.

The hardest thing to get down technique-wise are the transitions.  I recommend you practice doing just those a couple times, and also get your transition set-up right.  I like to lay all my bike stuff out with a towel over it, and then have all my run stuff set up next to it.  I also STRONGLY prefer to wear a tri-suit for almost the whole race, only adding a wetsuit on top if the water is really cold.  That way, I don't have to change at all and I can save myself some time.  Especially in a sprint, those transitions really matter.  If you haven't ever done a mass start swim, just make sure you're ready for the claustrophobia that might ensue.  I swam in HS and college, and tri starts are still a little stressful for me since there are people EVERYWHERE.  Make sure you have good goggles, tinted if its going to be sunny, and some sort of body lube/vaseline is also great if youre getting into a tight wetsuit.

Lake swimming is a completely different mental game.   Check and see if the race organizers are having a newbie talk or pre-race meeting. The first sprint I did had an info meeting the night before and it was really nice to be able to ask questions- it made sleeping that night much easier.

This is because I don't know what I did but I've had a weird pain near my upper left shoulder for a few days now. The pain is closer to my neck than the edge of my shoulder and feels kind of like a pinched nerve. This has happened to me the last few times I have bench pressed and I was kinda guilty of using machines because I wasn't confident enough in my form for upper body exercises (thus, the holding off).

xxfitness,3e24hb,LGoldGirl,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"I workout mostly at night, so I REALLY want to avoid caffeine as much as possible.  I don't get enough sleep as it is. A friend had also suggested b-12... I wonder if that and the Citrulline Malate might help."
xxfitness,3e24hb,aminoacyl,6,Tue Jul 21 13:14:35 2015 UTC,I don't get enough sleep as it is   I would fix this before adding a supplement. You can't build a house on a broken foundation.
xxfitness,3e24hb,LGoldGirl,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"Fixing that is easier said than done. First, I've been an insomniac since I was 4 or 5. I can't take sleeping meds, because they give me narcolepsy. Second, if I want to workout, I cannot get 8 hours of sleep most days, especially during the summer, when I work extended hours. On my days off, I am physically incapable of sleeping past 7 AM (and usually I can't sleep that long).     The last 2-3 years is actually the best I've been, and I probably get 7 hours of sleep at least 2x per week, and between 4 and 6 the other nights. That said, Monday through Friday, I am out of the house for work by 7 AM at the latest (up by 5:30 AM to shower, get ready for work, and eat breakfast). I work from 8 AM - 6 PM, and go directly from work from the gym. If all goes well, and I make the 6:30 PM class, I am home by 8-8:30, depending on whether I have errands I have to run on the way back from the gym.  If I am too late for the 6:30 class, I do mobility, core and other stuff, until 7:30 PM, take the 7:30 PM class, and don't get home until 9, at the earliest.    Once I'm home, I have to make and eat dinner (usually about 700-1,000 calories, mostly consisting of carbohydrates), shower, get my stuff ready for the next day, and do any chores (cat litter, dishes, loading laundry) that need to be done. This typically takes until at least 10 PM. If one of my asshole cats runs out, I have to wait for her to get back before I go to bed. Even if I'm in bed by 10 PM, it usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour for me to actually go to sleep.   In addition to this, I'm a light sleeper. If I lock my cats out of my room, they make too much noise for me to sleep. If I let them sleep with me, they wake me up 2-4 times per night. My roommate (who is gone in 2 weeks, never to be replaced) also makes things difficult, because she's a clueless, lazy, inconsiderate bitch. I can wear a mask, and earplugs, but it only helps so much.    I can't put off errands, because if the minimum isn't done, my mind can't relax. I can't wake up later in the AM, because feeling rushed in the morning screws up my whole day.  It's just not feasible for me to get a whole heck of a lot more sleep than I'm getting."
xxfitness,3e24hb,MassivelyMini,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:51 2015 UTC,What are you eating before your workouts. Perhaps it has nothing to do with taking a pre-workout supplement but eating or not eating prior to a workout? Or you eat a few more carbs on your lunch?  Just a thought....

My ability to move weight isn't an issue, stamina and endurance is).     My day up until my workout, generally looks something like this:  Breakfast: 4 eggs, cooked in coconut oil, veggies, 1/2 serving of raw cashews  Snack: 1/2 serving nuts/ quest bar, and veggies  Lunch: 2-4 cups veggies, lean protein, 1 tablespoon olive oil  Snack: 1/2 serving nuts, or quest bar  2nd snack (30-60 minutes pre-workout): 1 serving rice crackers, 1-2 tablespoons of hummus  I eat most of my carbs post workout, to replenish glycogen stores.

Theanine taken with caffeine smooths out the ""edges"" of caffeine (e.g. jitters, hyper-stimulation, anxiety) and helps promote calm, active attention & focus. This may not be as necessary for people that don't have caffeine/stimulant sensitivity but it's a must for me!  I try to take the pill 20-30 minutes prior to workout; sometimes I combine with my AM protein shake with has 2-4oz of cold-brew coffee in it but I don't like take the pill with a regular full (8-10oz) cup of coffee."

When doing dumbbell or bodyweight squats I can very easily get far below parallel, but whenever I add the bar, I either don't go deep enough, or if I do manage to go parallel, when I stand up I tip forward and my right knee buckles inwards. What can be done to prevent this?"
xxfitness,3e24hb,boxwagon,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:20 2015 UTC,"Record it as 8kg.  For your squats you need to keep a more solid core.  Plant your feet and push through the middle/heel of your foot, thinking about driving your knees out, keeping your chest up and pushing your hips forwards.  It sounds like you're only trying to stand up with your legs, which is part of a squat but just that - a part."
xxfitness,3e24hb,mahi-mahi,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:24 2015 UTC,I've generally been told to weight as 8kg if you're using 8kg dumbbells.
xxfitness,3e24hb,_missCBong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"Just curious and totally newbie, any reason why we have to log it as 8kg with dumbbells? Because if using barbells we will log it as 2x8kg right?"
xxfitness,3e24hb,mahi-mahi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"I would think it's just easier to keep track of, always enter the weight that is written on the equipment you use. Saves you from having to do math or confuse your weights (like, hey was 16kg 2x8kgs or using 16kg dumbbells?). If you log the type of exercise (ie dumbbell bench press) then it's implied you used two. Some other dumbbell exercises only have you use one (ie. goblet squat). If doing curls or something like that, you can train each arm individually or simultaneously and you'd still be entering the same weight.   So it's just simpler to enter the weight of individual dumbbells.   Edit : not sure if that's what you were asking regarding barbells, but if you're using the fixed weight barbells, the weight written on them is already the total weight. (ie. a barbell that says ""8kg"" is actually 8kg, not 2x8kg)"
xxfitness,3e24hb,Zephyrine_93,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"So I've recently started doing SC at home. I do military press with two pair of 13.5 lb dumbbells and I cant do more than 12 reps. But my next set of weights are 18 lb which currently are too heavy for me and I can't do more than 5-6 reps. Should I do more reps with 13.5 lbs or less with 18? Also I'm trying to lift ultra slow to make those 12 reps harder. Does it make any difference?   Not totally fitness related; but after one month on Keto I can no longer resist the summer fruits and I'm currently eating up to 60 g net carbs a day. I have zero cravings for bread or pasta or any other kind of carbs though. Does 50-60 g carbs still count as low carb? I used to BINGE on fruits and limiting my servings to 2-3 piece of fruits is kind of a victory.   Also I've  been on a 1200-300 calorie diet for a very long time but been stalling (I've bern using a food scale) I've just upped my calories to 1500 after starting SC, hoping to make some muscle to up my metabolism. Is it even logic? I was getting frustrated and discouraged and started binging like crazy. Should I just woman up and keep on cutting? I'm 21, 164.5 cm and anywhere between 59-62 kg."
xxfitness,3e24hb,mahi-mahi,4,Tue Jul 21 13:10:18 2015 UTC,1200 cals is very few calories to be cutting on. I entered your stats in a TDEE calculator and it gave me ~1650 calories for a sedentary lifestyle. That means that you're still cutting at 1500cals even if you don't workout at all. No wonder you feel like binging when cutting on 1200cals (and stalling in weightloss). 1500 should allow you to still lose some weight without starving all the time.   Also I'm not too familiar with the SC program - how many reps are you supposed to do? If you can do a few reps with good form with the 18lb dumbbells I'd stick with those until you get to the number of reps you should be doing. And yes I believe it does make a difference if you go super slow with the lighter dumbbells.
xxfitness,3e24hb,Zephyrine_93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:29 2015 UTC,It says between 8-12 reps. I'll give my 17lbs a try then!  Thanks for your reply.
xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Starting Strength covers some of your questions. If I remember correctly (Rippetoe is the instructor in the videos and he's hilarious in a manly man sort of way so expect some rude statements), moving a weight slowly means you can move something heavy really slow, but if you want to move something really heavy with explosive speed, you should be pressing that weight as quickly as you can while maintaining form.   I don't know the rules of keto, but /r/keto can probably help!   Upping your calories to keep your workouts and strength PRs is a common strategy! If you're on a cut and still losing fat at 1500 calories, then keep on keepin on with your new plan.   EDIT: watch the Rippetoe videos and read the intro and faq for better info on your first question. :)"

I've gained a bit since getting on and off the pill, and I don't know if that is even  possible but I really believe the pill has changed my figure, I've got dem hips and boobs :/ Used to be very thin and the sudden weight gain has made me damn afraid of weighing and measuring myself. That's why I'm bothering everyone with my calorie related questions - it's hard to tell if I'm doing everything right without a number on the scale.

xxfitness,3e24hb,Mozie23,2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:28 2015 UTC,"For the military press, I would do the first rep with the 18 lb weights (even if you can't do more than 5 or 6) and then use the lighter weights for the next two reps.  In a week or two, you can transition to doing the first two reps with the heavier weights and then eventually you can do all three reps with them."

xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,3,Tue Jul 21 13:11:19 2015 UTC,"DOMS should be at its worst 48 hours after the exercise. The right side should even out by then. If not, maybe you're working your left side harder; it could be your dominant side. If you've ever seen new-ish runners toward the end of a marathon, you'll notice they have one shoulder pushed forward and a definite dominant/stronger side. Making sure you train both sides evenly should help.   Hmmmm the more I've thought about it, the opposite could be true. Your left might be the weaker side and because you've started evening out your exercise, it has to work to keep up with your dominant right side. If that's the case, keep it up and they'll even out eventually.   Really not sure which it is though!"

xxfitness,3e24hb,Inksplotter,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:01 2015 UTC,"She probably means knots, or trigger points. They are spasms in that the muscle is sort of 'stuck' in a contracted position, and has been for a long time. (This is often in response to injury. The muscle gets a little pull in it, and seizes in the area immediately around it as a protective measure. Sometimes these never really relax, and the flexibility work you do is working around these little hard crunchy bits. That's why trigger point therapy is often beneficial to flexibility, because some flexibility is 'bound up' in these points. When they relax, you have more 'give' to work with.) Long term ones probably won't feel like much of anything other than a hard spot. If you work at it consistently for a while, you should be able to get them to feel like when you foam roll your calves- which have 'younger' trigger points in them."

If you swear to god that you're weighing everything and not sleep-snacking and not forgetting to count soda: Track measurements rather than weight. A pound of muscle takes up a lot less room than a pound of fat, so you'll be able to see change when it happens.

Injury details: I have woken up several times with joint injuries, shoulder, hip, etc.  Apparently, injuring your joints while asleep is a thing. I walked up a staircase and felt a POP in my ankle, then terrible pain and swelling. This lasted a year and is still tender. So I move around very gingerly. It's hard to exercise if you're walking around on eggshells. No health insurance, btw. I try to do some stretching every day. I try to ride an exercise bike but my hips hurt afterward. Maybe I have some type of arthritis, now that I think about it. The vertigo comes and goes. If I stay perfectly still I'm ok. Similarly, staying perfectly still and getting exercise are not compatible. Help! Thanks!"

xxfitness,3e24hb,Jamlampshade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"Recently started adding weights (5kg dumbbells, so only still light weight) and have a question about squatting passed parallel. I can just about get parallel, but when I try and go any further I end up falling over backwards. I am not sure if it is an issue with ankle mobility or calf tightness or both. So I am just looking for any tips on how to squat deeper."
xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,2,Tue Jul 21 11:34:41 2015 UTC,"I started with yoga before ever getting into weight lifting and I found the squat was similar to a malasana squat so had a leg up when I began doing them regularly as part of starting strength. I think working on calf and ankle flexibility will help you. Also, just trying to squat without weight and hanging out there, toes pointed outward a bit and knees following that direction, with elbows against knees pushing them out to be parallel to feet and back with natural lumbar curve, will help. See how it goes if you can stay here or keep working to get your feet flat.   Still feel like a newb so take my advice with a grain of salt ;)"
xxfitness,3e24hb,Inksplotter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:14 2015 UTC,"Probably ankle mobility, but could also be hip exterior rotation. Or even hamstrings, if you are being scrupulous about not letting your back round.  Because you're holding the weight in front of you, you're actually doing a squat that's more demanding on your flexibility! In backsquats you can 'fold' more from the waist in order to keep the weight dropping over your midfoot.  Try hanging out in a paleo squat for several minutes at a time as part of your mobility work. Hang on to a doorframe or pole so you don't fall over backwards, and focus on rotating your knees out, make sure they track over your toes, and keep your spine straight. Work towards not having to hold on to something."
xxfitness,3e24hb,workin_out,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:47:02 2015 UTC,"You need to counter balance. The bar helps keep your weight forward so you don't fall back. Since you're using dumbbells, you might have to bring them forward until they're slightly in front of you so you can balance."

xxfitness,3e24hb,centelleo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:12 2015 UTC,Do I have to do yoga every day to reap the benefits of better mobility and flexibility? Will I see progress if I only practice 3-4x week? What yoga mat do you recommend for beginners under $75? What accessories (other than blocks and a strap) do you recommend? Does anyone have a membership to Core Power Yoga? I'm debating between this chain and a local studio. I imagine the chain varies by location but any insight is appreciated.
xxfitness,3e24hb,HopeAnew,2,Tue Jul 21 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"Yoga and flexibility: No. I do yoga twice a week, on the same day as weights, then weights on my third day at the gym. I've not noticed any stall in my flexibility or ability to do yoga. Honestly, 5x/week vinyasa/power yoga sounds exhausting!  JADE YOGA MAT! Seriously! It's got this texture that prevents slipping even when you're drenched (I sweat a lot in yoga!)! On Amazon, I think it's $70. It smells like rubber but totally worth it! Two blocks, one strap, and a blanket for restorative poses should be fine. Usually the studio or gym will have these to use for free or rent for cheap. Might want to wait for the first class before purchasing.  No, can't help you with that. Doesn't just vary by chain, but by instructor. Each one has a different style and preference on how to go through a flow. I go to a gym and do vinyasa yoga 2x/week and have two different instructors (sometimes three if I want to go to restorative yoga on a third day, but I've found an hour of this is pretty boring, but mixing in restorative poses at the end of vinyasa is wonderful); each has wildly varying ways of building strength and flexibility. There is a ton of crossover in poses and how to do them correctly (there's usually a few good ways to hold a pose and they should correct you if you're not doing it one of those ways -- you can meet the instructor before the class and ask about corrections or give them permission to touch and/or correct you).    Sorry I ELI5 if you didn't need it. Best of luck!   EDIT: if you do buy extras before going to a class, don't bring the blanket the first time, it's often not used and you'd feel a little awkward carrying it around in that case."
xxfitness,3e24hb,forcontrast,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"Others may be able to better address the first two points, but my thoughts on Core Power vs. local studio are this: If budget allows and you're looking for a more focused, meditative practice, go for the local studio. I don't have a regular Core Power membership, but I've dropped in for classes from time to time, and I've found that their classes are very sculpt/cardio-focused. Pretty sure all of their instructors have to go through the same teacher training program, so class structure and flow are similar/the same, even if the instructors are different. I've found that a Core Power class definitely follows a set order of things, where smaller studio instructors are more likely to tailor a class to the students' preferences (like, focusing on hip-opening poses if enough students have expressed an interest in doing those at the time). Additionally, Core Power classes tend to be PACKED at peak hours, so you may not get as much individual adjustment or form correction from the instructor as you would at an independent studio.   Pretty sure Core Power does a week of free classes, so you can test it out. I'd check and see if the local studio does the same, so you can better compare and see what style of yoga you like best.  tl;dr: Want a cardio-based workout and to ""feel the burn"" while doing yoga? Go for Core Power. Want to have more focus on meditation and a bit more diversity in classes/poses/techniques? Go for the local studio."

It hurts during a variety of activities, and particularly when I try to engage my glutes or core - not every time, but there's definitely a relation. Even just walking while trying to engage my glutes, it was hurting. It also hurts during very small back extensions that are supposed to strengthen the lower back.

Then, I did keto hardcore for about 6 months and then gradually weened myself off of it, as well as, weening myself off of counting calories. Since then, which has been about 8-9 months, I just try to eat small, healthy snacks in between my meals, cut out most processed foods, and watch my artificial sugar intake. My only two weaknesses are chips and ice cream, which I obviously can't go crazy on anyway since there is nothing healthy about either of those foods, but I definitely do eat them occasionally. It really hasn't been that difficult to stay mostly low carb since gradually going off strict keto. The only reason I went off strict keto is because I did actually end up getting tired of all the fats. Plus, I will say that keto (just like any very specific diet) is a commitment. It can be done and a lot of people do it, but I just didn't want to deal with it anymore. With diet and exercise I had already reached my weight goal so I wanted something more sustainable and less work. The result, over 3 years, I lost 34 lbs. I'm now 104 lbs, but am working on lifting to gain more muscle because since I went on medicine for PCOS, I lost more weight than I intended.

My only issue so far is that there has been a bit of pilling on the fabric in the inner thigh/crotch area but that's most likely because I wear mine so often."
xxfitness,3e0vks,jmair,3,Tue Jul 21 11:27:26 2015 UTC,"Are sweetlegs for workouts though? I always thought they were more of a sweatpants material like you would wear running errands, not sweating at the gym. My whole life would change if you told me these tights were made for the gym..."
xxfitness,3e0vks,Mazzuccalane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:57 2015 UTC,"They're the same thickness as any other tights, it's just that the material is softer. They aren't made out of any sort of compression/wicking fabric, but other than that they're fine for a regular gym session I think!"
xxfitness,3e0vks,jmair,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:45 2015 UTC,Unghhh. I'm trying to not spend money and this isn't good.

xxfitness,3e0vks,StephieBubbles,5,Tue Jul 21 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting us know!  I have been debating buying some, and was hesitant since I had no idea about the see through factor."
xxfitness,3e0vks,chromachord,4,Tue Jul 21 06:39:34 2015 UTC,"I bought several pairs and, gotta say, was pretty disappointed with the quality. So damn see through and they just felt...scratchy? They survived working out just fine, but I have to wear longer shirts so cover the lady parts. Definitely not buying any more leggings from them."
xxfitness,3e0vks,deathbyblackhole,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:37 2015 UTC,I have a question about the material. Does it feel slightly... Spandexy like plasticy? Idk if I'm phrasing this right. I ask because I currently wear tight legging like workout pants and when I sweat the material just clings to my legs Soooooo uncomfortably and when I squat or move my legs in a long motion I can feel the fabric pulling on my skin and I absolutely loathe it.
xxfitness,3e0vks,deathbyblackhole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm. The closest I can describe is the fabric feels a lot like the Target compression tights I have, so if that helps as a point of reference.   I also did train in them this morning,  including moderate cardio,  and they seemed to breathe well."
xxfitness,3e0vks,mmemmetee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm gonna look into purchasing a pair. Like your choices. May have to cop one of those second ones.
xxfitness,3e0vks,_mollywobbles,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:04 2015 UTC,I think the trick for these types of fashionable leggings is to go a size up and alter the waistband with elastic.
xxfitness,3e0vks,HopeAnew,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:56 2015 UTC,The dark ones are so cute! I might pick up a pair and just make sure my tanks are long enough to cover everything else up. Thanks for sharing!
xxfitness,3e0vks,idamayer,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"Question about workout gear and the panties showing through. Is it good to quietly mention to another lady in the weight room that her undies show through quite a bit while in a squat? Or is that just creepy?   I'm a female and am often the only woman in the weight room so I didn't want to alienate a potential friend by noticing her butt across the room so I didn't say anything. But I know I appreciate when someone tells me there's something in my teeth, even if I don't know them. Is it the same thing?"
xxfitness,3e0vks,Lambister,7,Tue Jul 21 13:14:35 2015 UTC,I may die quietly a little inside but appreciate it in the long run.
xxfitness,3e0vks,44617a65,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"We had a big debate about this. I'd rather not be told, lots of people would want to know. I think do what you would want and as long as you're not a jerk about it the other person will be receptive. Unless they are a jerk in which case didn't wanna be gym friends with them anyway"
xxfitness,3e0vks,Lambister,-22,Tue Jul 21 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"One caveat - they are see-through. Very.   Thats because they are leggings, not pants. They are made to go under skirts or shorts and long shirts or dresses. Leggings are also not work out clothing.  The designs you picked and look great and I'm a massive fan of society 6, but when picking work out clothing, I go with the fun tank tops instead :)"
xxfitness,3e0vks,eleanor_ramilly,14,Tue Jul 21 09:28:28 2015 UTC,Those sheer leggings that are more like pantyhose without feet are not pants. A pair of leggings made of an opaque material is not much different than a pair of skinny jeans in terms of snugness. No one argues that skinny jeans aren't pants.
xxfitness,3e0vks,SpiderWolfwoof,18,Tue Jul 21 10:35:07 2015 UTC,Ah! But they advertise them as perfect for fashion or working out.
xxfitness,3e0vks,Lambister,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:10:48 2015 UTC,Then I would contact them and give feedback that they aren't wholly adequate.

xxfitness,3e0vks,Lambister,3,Tue Jul 21 11:52:55 2015 UTC,"Not really, there's a pretty big range. Yoga and other work-out leggings are made to be worn as pants, pantyhose is meant to be worn under skirts and dresses, and somewhere in between those two lay shitty leggings that are intended to be pants but are too translucent."

xxfitness,3e46i4,99Dusenflieger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats on getting through all you've gotten through. As far as diet goes--since your situation is temporary, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Hell, you're recovering from surgery and a cancer diagnosis, you should feel free to eat some ice cream. Maybe go by the 80/20 rule--80% healthy, 20% freebies. Generally I'd just say nothing you don't already know--try to eat around your TDEE, opt where possible and palatable for whole/minimally processed foods, especially veggies; keep added sugar to a minimum; get plenty of protein to mitigate muscle loss (and if you can incorporate any kind of resistance training that'd be good too, but obviously do what your PT says)."
xxfitness,3e46i4,pamplemousse2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I was leaning toward all the tips you gave, but was unsure if my TDEE would change with being more sedentary. I was eating any 2300 calories per day when I was lifting. I know I won't require as much now. Also, whoops, by ""temporary"" I meant 6+ months. Doc says I won't be able to run for a year. Yoga in three months. It's gonna be a long process."

xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,106,Mon Jul 20 14:57:48 2015 UTC,"Fuck that article. The video from your gym is awesome.   This vid (below) is from an unexpected pull-up contest the weekend before last. I got 10, and I placed 2nd. None of the women participating got less than 7.  The woman who best me was tall, with long arms. https://instagram.com/p/5AardxAUH4/  I don't even know why articles like that get approved."
xxfitness,3dya76,rex_ford,25,Mon Jul 20 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"Also,  as an observation,  the main flaw in that study,  it seems to me,  is not training women on pull ups to do pull ups.  What happened to specificity?   Couldn't they have done negatives,  band assisted pull ups,  even horizontal rows as part of their training?"
xxfitness,3dya76,bewaretherabbit,5,Mon Jul 20 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"It just makes no sense and I don't even get why they would do that kind of protocol and then present the results as factual evidence of some kind of biological truth. Definitely those exercises would have at least been more consistent with the goal of performing a pullup, and they could have still included the other stuff as accessories. Especially if they'd done assisted pullups, they would have been able to gauge improvement.  ALSO: Band assisted pullups made a huge contribution to my ability to do multiple pullups."
xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,8,Mon Jul 20 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on sticking with banded pull-ups, but negatives, hangs, rings rows, etc, would all be better."
xxfitness,3dya76,rex_ford,8,Mon Jul 20 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence on banded pull ups -  there seems to be a mix of views and I've used them in my personal programs - but regardless, I put them ahead of lat pull downs when it comes to improving pull ups.   Anyway. I'm not the only one who noticed the study seemed flawed and was annoyed by their conclusion.   But it did give us a video with a bunch  of baddass women doing pull ups,  so there's that victory."
xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,5,Mon Jul 20 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"My only issue with banded pull-ups is that I see people use them for long periods of time and not progress. I also don't actually think that anyone should do a kipping pull-up unless they can do at least a couple strict ones, but there is some disagreement on that."
xxfitness,3dya76,QueenFrodo,3,Mon Jul 20 18:07:49 2015 UTC,It's easy to become over dependent on banded pull ups.  When i really stwrted putting in work on getting thr pull up it was negatives and form.   Switching to thinking about pulling my elbows to my side instead of my self to the bar made a HUGE difference
xxfitness,3dya76,mentionthistome,9,Tue Jul 21 04:48:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is awesome. Any tips on getting better at these? I can do strict chin-ups all day, but as soon as I switch to a palms out grip I struggle."
xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,15,Mon Jul 20 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"I focus I. Trying to bend the bar, and pulling down so my shoulder blades squeeze together towards the middle of my back. Also, keep your core tight and as hollow as possible, and squeeze your butt."
xxfitness,3dya76,go_nahuel,10,Mon Jul 20 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"lol @ squeeze your butt. I feel like I look so stupid when I do pullups because I'm flexing pretty much everything to knock out 6, hahaha."
xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,5,Mon Jul 20 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a pull-up or chin-up requires full body tension, at least if you want to knock out multiples without kipping."
xxfitness,3dya76,mentionthistome,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The butt squeeze helps me with chin-ups, but I've never tried to visualize bending the bar. Excited to try this."
xxfitness,3dya76,astrophela,11,Mon Jul 20 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"Pull your elbows INWARD, not down.  Don't exhaust your grip:  focus on gripping with outer fingers (I actually don't have my pointer finger wrapped around the bar when I do them).  Hope this helps :)"
xxfitness,3dya76,mentionthistome,4,Mon Jul 20 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"Damn, this is another piece of advice I've never heard/read elsewhere. Will try! Thank you and god bless /r/xxfitness."
xxfitness,3dya76,Lambister,7,Mon Jul 20 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend working out your triceps more through other excercises.  Chin ups require most power from your biceps, pull ups from your triceps. I started doing dimond push ups to improve my tricep strength,  its improved my overhang climbing and pull up ability :) I might be wrong though,  maybe someone else can help!"
xxfitness,3dya76,mentionthistome,3,Mon Jul 20 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Makes sense. For triceps I typically do pull-downs, standing dumbbell press, and occasionally skullcrushers, but my biceps are definitely stronger than my tris. I'll give the diamond push-ups a whirl."
xxfitness,3dya76,definitelyapotato,4,Mon Jul 20 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"You're probably using a wider grip for pullups. A narrower grip will make it almost as easy as a chinup as it puts your elbows in a position to move forward, involving more biceps."
xxfitness,3dya76,mentionthistome,3,Mon Jul 20 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely true -- My gym has a few sets of pull-up/chin-up bars, one is the assisted machine and the others are unassisted, but the spacing is the same on all of them. Guess I need to take my pull-up practice to a playground or something so I can find a straight bar. Thanks!"
xxfitness,3dya76,Nikkian42,4,Mon Jul 20 17:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yay to you and all the women in the pull-up contest!  Also agreed on the article... it's sad that stuff like that get's taken for ""truth"" all too often."

xxfitness,3dya76,Vanetia,73,Mon Jul 20 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"Wow. WOW. I had never seen that article before, and now, just rage.  I know very fit people who can't do a weighted squat. I know other fit people who can't do a power clean. They can't do these not due to some mystical, gender-linked failure of levers or body fat, but because they haven't specifically trained that move yet.  What an absolutely b.s. study design that piece quotes. You don't get someone to do a pull up by training them in other weight exercises and putting them on a diet, then hoping after some time they can magically achieve a different movement they haven't trained. You get them to do it by trying to do it.   Obviously the average man and the average woman have differing abilities but 'women can't do a pull up' because $_broscience should be consigned to the bin alongside 'women can't run a marathon' and 'women can't ride bicycles'. That is straight up some Victorian pearl-clutching shit.  Good on your gym for the video."
xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,43,Mon Jul 20 15:58:10 2015 UTC,That is straight up some Victorian pearl-clutching shit.   Quoting this because it deserves to be repeated
xxfitness,3dya76,aupa,12,Mon Jul 20 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly this!  I come from a sprint kayaking background, we train pull-ups heavily because they compliment the muscles needed to kayak.  So pullups for me are easy, because I trained them so much.  But until I started actually training squats I couldn't do one properly or with a lot of weight.  For me the big challenge was squatting my bodyweight, I finally did it after a year of really dedicated work.    You have to train a movement if you want to do it effectively and women who can do pullups have trained it.  They aren't a minority who can magically do it because biology."
xxfitness,3dya76,99Dusenflieger,4,Mon Jul 20 16:09:16 2015 UTC,"My new estimated 1 RM bench is 136 lb (115 bw), and my new estimated 1 RM squat is 151. I did a set of 6 bench presses at 120 last week, and a set of 6 squats at 135. That means that my squat and bench are only 15 lbs apart, because I trained upper body more and therefore the form is a lot easier for me. I can dead lift over 200, and my legs are probably strong enough to squat more than 151, but I'm not trained well enough on that movement to do it. The same is true for many people and pull-ups. They are strong enough, but they just don't get the movement yet."
xxfitness,3dya76,gymell,9,Mon Jul 20 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. Honestly I can't do a pull-up, but I can run for days on end. I don't want to sound cocky, but I'm sure I can run a faster mile than some of the guys at my gym who can do 10+ pull-ups. This is because I run everyday and my body is trained to run. Compared to the guys who lift everyday and do pull-ups everyday. I simply cannot do a pull-up because I haven't trained my body to do it. Now, I've been working on my goal of doing one pull-up for about a month now and surprise, surprise I can see progress as I can pull myself up halfway now. This article is stupid and is honestly demeaning to women and their fitness abilities."
xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,18,Mon Jul 20 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"My friend started lifting after getting a divorce and found doing pull-ups really symbolically empowering--being able to lift her own weight. Now every birthday she does as many pull-ups as the age she is turning (in sets of 10 or so). She recently turned 54.   (I also do pull-ups--with ankle weights--and enjoy jumping on the bar after some cocky-looking dude does a bunch with lousy form, like kicking all over the place. I usually do 8-9 but can do 12 or so without the weights.)"
xxfitness,3dya76,gymell,31,Mon Jul 20 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"Here's me doing 10 chinups  (first one got cut off the video) at a Marine exibit booth. All the other women I saw just did static holds, and none of the guys were doing full range of motion. So I wanted to show them how it's done.  Here's another video where we did a 1 rep max chinup test at my gym. I got up to +42.5 pounds. We were required to do a slow descent.  I can't speak to the < 25% body fat rule as I'm well below that. I could see how it would be recommended though."

xxfitness,3dya76,orange_teapots,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"Nope. If your shoulders are strong enough to do pull-ups, than a dead hang isn't going to hurt them.  As for being tall, find a higher bar, or bend at the knee, cross your feet behind you, get into a dead hang, and start your sets from there."

My BF% was at 28% just a bit ago, and I'm pretty sure it hasn't dropped too far.  I really don't believe that % thing.

I don't care how much they need to lose or how much strength they need to gain. They'll all eventually do it. And I have an excellent success rate of around 90% for those that stick with the program I created.  I hate that there's a double standard that women can't/shouldn't have upper body strength and don't/shouldn't have to worry about it. Not that everyone should feel like they HAVE to do pullups, but c'mon. Ladies are just as capable as the guys are.  I challenged Alan Aragon to a pullup contest at The Fitness Summit a couple months ago and I was sure I could do at least 15, but maybe 20. This was 17, and maybe not even a true max. At this point, I feel like i could repeat and do 20 or more: http://youtu.be/qQ35GfQv4Jk"

We should encourage them to play the same.
xxfitness,3dya76,thestillnessinmyeyes,7,Mon Jul 20 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"I got my first chin-up at 200+ lbs and I'm 5'10"". So overweight, kinda tall ... did a chinup. And I was 33 years old.   It can be done, ladies! Consistency and patience! Negatives and 1 or 2 attempts like 2-3 days a week. And I got it, from a dead hang, after a few months."
xxfitness,3dya76,copper_rainbows,6,Mon Jul 20 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"The first part of that article is hilarious, they took a bunch of 'normal weight females'.... haha. As if being able to do a pull up is directly proportional to being 'normal weight' and not being a female. Also, they didn't have them solely focus on strength but also fat loss, which can sometimes hinder strength (although not always) especially if you didn't have a good muscle base to begin with.   Being able to do a pull up is directly proportional to training pull ups not doing curls.  Silly non-scientific evidence based articles (who pose as being scientific by throwing a professors name into the mix).  Your gym's video is pretty freaking awesome!   I did 16 pullups in a row on Friday... hoping to get to 20 in the near future!"

P.S., You may be saying ""only on the weekends"" now, but let me tell ya, climbing is addictive! If you catch the bug like I did, just be super careful not to overdo it -- overuse injuries are very common, especially in the finger and elbow tendons, but you can go a long way toward avoiding them by not trying to do too much too soon, and reading up on how to do good warm-up stretches. For the first year at least, I wouldn't try to do more than 2-3x/week for maybe 2-3 hours max per session. Tendons take much longer than muscles do to get stronger, so it's all too easy to overstress them as you make those quick newbie gains in ability."

xxfitness,3dya76,B0yWonder,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:09 2015 UTC,tell women that they need to drop their body fat percentage below at least 25% in order to do a pullup.   I can definitively say it's pretty much impossible for me to do at 40% body fat. :D  Seems all the rest of my lifts (including dips!!) are going great except for that goddamned assisted pullup.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Eventually my upper body strength will meet my weight loss in a happy pull-up medium.

xxfitness,3dya76,BernforBernie,2,Mon Jul 20 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"What the fuck nyt! Train women to do pull ups by... Not doing pull ups? Your coach is kickass! I feel myself pulling my body together: legs crossed, arms in. Let's take up space women!"
xxfitness,3dya76,cryogenetik,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"I really like that video. I went through PE in the era where girls did the flexed-arm hang and weren't even shown how to do a pull-up. Yeah. And as former soccer player, it wasn't a skill that I ever focused on... so needless to say, I currently cannot do a pull-up. My goal, however, is to do one by the end of the year."
xxfitness,3dya76,BernforBernie,3,Mon Jul 20 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty awesome!  Seems like a lot of ladies in this video have their legs extend out in front of them while pulling up. Is that a natural center of mass counter balance for women, or was the pull up taught to them this way? I'm curious as I have never had that compulsion. It seems like it would work my abs as well. Or is that the point?"
xxfitness,3dya76,cryogenetik,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"My particular gym comes from a gymnastics background, so you are taught to very heavily engage the lats.  Ido Portal was the trainer to my trainers, and he starts really strengthening the lats by doing this exercise.  Because the hips naturally come forward some people also bring their legs forward (both men and women).  Plus our gym has also been working on pull-ups while in an L-sit in progression to rope climbs in an L-sit.  So I guess it's a reactionary thing at my gym in particular.  I personally have the Ido Portal arch, so my feet are behind my hips and I'm leaning back into the pullup."
xxfitness,3dya76,LGoldGirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about the different leg positions as well. I train on my own and have always felt like it's easier to have my legs extend out in front of me, but I'm not sure why."
xxfitness,3dya76,rachelina,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"Was told in middle school that men are stronger than women. For a long time I took that to mean that women shouldn't even bother to try. Then I realized that trying is a very big part in how strong you are. And now I find it a lot easier to do push-ups, because I'm not hindered by thinking that it's harder for me because I'm a girl."

xxfitness,3dya76,Debbie87,5,Tue Jul 21 09:26:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the article is wrong, maybe just framed wrong. It's harder for women to do pull ups for the reasons that were listed. It requires more training. I've been doing assisted pull-ups 2x weekly for months and I'm still not there. Tbh I'm already annoyed with the musculature I've developed training to do one pull-up, so I might just abandon that quest.   In comparison, I know several guys who don't work out but are still able to do a few pull-ups."
xxfitness,3dya76,gertrudeblythe,6,Mon Jul 20 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"The article for me was problematic in that it was framed heavily in pseudo science.  They didn't outline the training regime and whether or not it was actually the best regime for achieving a pullup.  They also didn't repeat the study with men who couldn't do a pull up to see if there was a similar instance or a different result for the men versus the women.  There was also no mention of actual lat activation differences between men and women, which to me would provide scientific evidence that pullups are actually harder for women.  Women do tend to use and exercise lats less in the general public, so it would take longer to develop muscles that were previously almost entirely inactive.  Whereas men are encouraged to utilize lats in gym classes as young as elementary school, as well as into highschool (football training, etc).  I think there is a larger societal impact of how we teach men and women to exercise at a young age, as opposed to certain biological differences.  As someone who came from the background I did, every woman I trained with could do pull-ups, and this was women from a lot of different musculatures and statures.  I knew competitive women kayakers who could beat male kayakers at pull-ups easily during out fitdex (testing milestones for kayaking done once a year prior to competitive season).    For myself, pull-ups are easy and honestly were the easiest exercise for me to get as a female, they are something I still excel at 15 years later.  I know a lot of women on here are on a quest to get a pullup, and they can, regardless of musculature and testosterone levels.  There are women on that video who thought they couldn't do a pullup because they were women, and that isn't a problem of biology, that's a problem of society."
xxfitness,3dya76,agreenway,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's bullshit. I take my cousins to the park and I ALWAYS see girls from ages 5 to around 13 or so playing on monkey bars and pulling themselves up without breaking a sweat. If you look at boys and girls from a young age, they are always about equal in strength and you will even notice how young girls have some muscle definition from being just as active as boys. If this bro-science was true, then little girls wouldn't be able to keep up or surpass boys, yet they always do up until a certain age where they stop being as active.  Girls are conditioned after a certain age to stop being as active or else they will ""lose"" their femininity, especially when it comes to their arms. I still see it here on this sub sometimes, where women want to get stronger but don't want their arms to get any bigger cause they don't want to have ""man arms"". So it's not at all surprising that when women start exercising again later, it will take more time to train and learn to do a pullup compared to men who have used their muscles a lot more than your average woman.  TL;DR: this study was poorly done and bullshit."
xxfitness,3dya76,corgibutt19,4,Mon Jul 20 23:04:51 2015 UTC,"The children point doesn't really hold water in this discussion, though. Men develop more muscle as they produce testosterone during puberty. Women develop larger thighs and hips as they go through puberty too. The characteristics that differentiate our body shapes and musculature don't kick in till after childhood, so looking at humans before puberty won't give us any relevant data besides disproving that women are ""inherently weak,"" which no one in their right mind tries to argue in the 21st century (they tend to at least try to be more precise). The puberty hormone for men makes them stronger, the puberty hormones for women simply do not.   That being said, I of course don't like the whole ""women shouldn't be strong"" culture we have going on. I love seeing all the strong women on here and can't wait till I get to that point too. I don't think people should use gender, sex, or hormones as an excuse. But kids are kind of a moot point in the current debate."
xxfitness,3dya76,missdeejers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:41:53 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm not arguing that guys aren't generally stronger than women, and I don't think anyone else here is, either. I already know that if we're going in terms of strength, such as who can lift more, guys are generally going to beat women in this competition every time.   However, we're talking about body weight pull ups here, something that everyone should be able to do. Pull ups are about lifting your own body weight, not about lifting more weight, so again, this is something everyone should be able to do. Women weigh less than men (typically) so even accounting for the fact that men are generally stronger, the pull ups would be about the same difficulty for women as it would be for men since they would be pulling up more weight.  When you look at the world record for most pull ups in a minute, 3 minutes, an hour, etc., men and women share almost the same numbers and if there were more women involved in exercising and strength training, the numbers would not doubt be even closer.   In the Crossfit games, when it comes to strict body weight pull ups, men and women are required to do the same amount of pull ups. Again, if men were biologically programmed to be better, then why are women able to do the same amount or more than them in these games?   My point in bringing up the children bit is that body weight pull ups are not something men are biologically programmed to be better at, women just stop working out those muscles after a certain ages while men tend to use them more.  From a young age almost every kid can pull up their own weight easily, and that ability won't go away as long as you are active, male or female. Hell, even the article OP posted shows that a quarter of the women who were part of the study were able to do a pullup after three months of resistance training."
xxfitness,3dya76,latrodectusmactans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"Yes but the female kids have a lower body fat percentage than they will after puberty. Body proportions are different. A sexually mature male who weighs the same as a given female will on average have more muscle and less fat than her, so he had more muscle available to lift the given body weight. Little girls don't have fatty butts and broad hips to lift. I agree neither sex is biologically programmed for given physical activities, but again, children and adults are composed differently and that does affect things."
xxfitness,3dya76,trixiegirl88,3,Tue Jul 21 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's also really dependent on who you are, and is true for men and women, dependent on build, size and base training.

You can easily add 150 calories to a sandwich by adding avocado and grilling like a grilled cheese with some olive oil. I add coconut oil to my plain popcorn. You can add a ton of calories just by utilizing healthy fats."
xxfitness,3e3i6s,kaylster,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:11 2015 UTC,Nuts are fantastic! A tiny amount of them is a huge amount of calories. Eat a small handful every two hours and you're going to see a huge change.
xxfitness,3e3i6s,Gingerdyke,3,Tue Jul 21 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"More calorie dense foods. As long as you're eating over maintenance, you'll gain. Assuming that you're currently eating at/around your TDEE, adding a few quick bites of calorie dense food will create a surplus - how much you snack (or sneak in extra calories each meal) will dictate how quickly you gain.   Some ideas: switch to full fat dairy. Grab a slice of ham and cheese on your way past the fridge. Two tablespoons of peanut butter out of the jar. Add regular butter to anything. Ranch or other dressing on veggies. Take a few extra bites per meal. Keep a bag of those awesome Snapea Crisps around (I dare you to try not eating the whole bag at once). Instead of grilling meat, put it into a frying pan with olive oil/coconut oil/butter/bacon fat. Whole fruit. Add sauce to things. Try out ""bulletproof coffee"" - or drink your calories another way.  Get creative, it's amazing how many calories you can add with ""clean foods"" without really noticing it."
xxfitness,3e3i6s,Yogainthesquatrack,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"I've been grilling extra chicken (you can use olive or coconut oil as a marinade and it might add some extra fat if you prefer to grill over saute) and throwing it on a small tortilla with spinach and a spicy mustard for a snack. It's not too much work if you already have the chicken cooked. It's a good way to get some extra calories for me, but I suppose if you are already full you might not want an extra mini sandwich wrap. I think the serving of almonds is, like, 13 or something, so I agree that is is a really easy way to add some good fat to your diet without feeling too full! I hate eating when I am full, too, so I feel your pain. You will need to train yourself to eat for a purpose - it is just as difficult for me as making it to the gym on a day I'm not feeling it."

xxfitness,3e42gw,obliquelyrun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"Yes that is a tough fear to overcome. I have a fear of drowning as well, which is one reason why I like to swim. So that I know I will be safe if I fall in. If you do decide to give swimming a try most pools will have life-jackets that you can use while you swim. Or you can stay in the shallow end and slowly work up your confidence. But I know for some people this fear is a lot harder to overcome. Good luck :)"

OR at my climbing gym which doesn't have a pool. Most gyms don't have pools so I'd have to look for something new to pick it up again. Chronic ear infections. I sometimes get them after showering :( I will wear wax earplugs when I swim for fitness but they are definitely a pain.   My favorite stroke was and will always be butterfly! Gotta love some endurance freestyle though.

Start by submerging yourself all the way and just swim under water. The monofin helps exaggerate the benefit of really getting your butt up high / bending at the hips.
xxfitness,3e42gw,staciloraine,2,Tue Jul 21 20:59:27 2015 UTC,I adore swimming. I grew up in cottage county and could swim like a fish. Then I moved somewhere new and there is nowhere to swim.  No indoor pools for miles. No outdoor bodies of water that aren't trespassing. :(

xxfitness,3e42gw,kam1012,3,Tue Jul 21 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"I don't regularly swim for the following reasons:   I don't have consistent pool access. The public ones near my house aren't open during hours I am home, and even if they were, I probably wouldn't trust them.  I am a lousy swimmer (I look okay, but in fact, waste a shit ton of energy breathing incorrectly, and not using my legs) Yes, I have to shower after every workout. No, I do not have to scrub my skin free of nasty, irritating chlorine, or deal with curly hair that is matted, after shoving it into a swim cap that failed to hold the water out anyway, so that I have to wash it, until it's dry and brittle, to get all of the chlorine out, after every workout.   It hurts my ankle like nothing else. Weight lifting, running, jumping and everything else don't bother my ankles, but the position it sits in when I swim, kills it."
xxfitness,3e42gw,HarveySpecs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling of pools having poor hours. Where I used to live I really had to coordinate my time around the pools hours. But what do you mean you wouldn't trust the pool? Do you mean you question how clean it is? To me it seems like you can fix 2 and 4 by practicing proper technique. I could give you some tips if you like? As for number 3 I'm afraid the only way to fix that is to find a soap and shampoo that work best. Lucky for me it's Dove body wash, and Head and Shoulders shampoo and any conditioner. Good luck!"
xxfitness,3e42gw,LGoldGirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"Nope. I have very curly hair.  The shampoo that works best is no shampoo. I shampoo my hair 1x per week. People with curly hair do not wash their hair frequently. We can't, and chlorinated water DESTROYS it.  I rinse my hair daily and put conditioner in it, but washing it frequently, or regularly exposing it to chlorine, would be asking to have to chop it all off.  As far as trusting the pool, it's a couple of things: 1) I live in a big city with budget problems. I don't exactly trust that the pools are kept clean, have lifeguards on duty, or are well maintained. 2) I've seen how kids rough house in our neighborhood pools, there's NO WAY I'd be able to actually swim laps in one. I'd get kicked in the face, or held under as a joke. My sister once held me under until my lungs filled with water and I started to lose consciousness. If a kid tried to hold me under just joking around, I'd FLIP OUT.  One of the rules among my friends growing up is that they couldn't dunk me, unless they wanted me huddled in a corner crying. I can't expect kids at a pool to know or care about that.  As far as the form, why work on it, when there's a ton of more easily accessible, enjoyable exercise that I can do that doesn't aggravate it? Swimming is very much a luxury exercise, and not worth it, when I can go to the gym, get a great workout, surrounded by friends, and then bike, walk or jog along the river on my active rest days."

I haven't swam in ages, and I'd like to get back to it, but I'm intimidated by the super athletic swimmers at the nearby gym. :(  Edit: Also, what about passing in the lanes? Agh, it's like learning to drive all over again."
xxfitness,3e42gw,MimesJumped,2,Tue Jul 21 21:08:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the pool. They should have signs up saying what the speed is and depending on the pool, what direction you should swim in. Sometimes you split the lane (each go up and down one side) if there's two of you, or swim in a circle type thing. You can just ask a lifeguard and tell them your skills and ask which would be appropriate for you."

Not every day is a super bright, fun pattern day, and the cheap basic ones I'm more likely to pair with louder, brighter tops.  Mix and match."

xxfitness,3e42br,idamayer,2,Tue Jul 21 20:52:26 2015 UTC,"Calculate cost per wear and decide what's worth it to you. For me, the cheap leggings are so much cheaper I'd rather buy those and repurchase when they wear out. OTOH, you're going to wear these often; if nicer tights make you happy then I think the extra expense is entirely justifiable."
xxfitness,3e1e1h,relocationswarm,13,Tue Jul 21 05:21:07 2015 UTC,"One thing you might try is fasting for ~16 hours, then getting up (no matter how little or much sleep you've had) and eating your next meal at a normal breakfast time. This is a tactic that helps people reset their circadian rhythms to avoid jet lag when they're traveling. Also, be sure to practice good sleep hygiene as much as you can.  If none of that helps, talk to your doctor. Sleep issues can be a symptom of a more serious medical issue."
xxfitness,3e1e1h,notoriousrdc,5,Tue Jul 21 06:49:28 2015 UTC,"Google ""good sleep hygiene"" for plenty of info, but here are some tips:   Nothing happens in bed except sleep and sex. No screen time for 30 mins before sleep (messes with your circadian rhythms). No caffeine after about 4 pm. Don't use alcohol to help you sleep: it can help you get to sleep but you'll wake up again a couple of hours later. Make sure the room is completely dark: lots of devices have LED lights that end up shining pretty brightly; cover or hide these. To help fall asleep:  I work on memorizing poetry and recite it to myself as I am falling sleep -- adding a couple of new lines each night and reciting everything learned up to that point, and starting from the top if I make a mistake. One or 2 times through and I am asleep: helps turn my brain off. Masturbation or sex can help you fall asleep too."

xxfitness,3e1e1h,dungeonkeepr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"I clean my room!  Organize my purse and gym bag, lay out my clothes for the next day, take any dishes I've accumulated into the kitchen, finish folding laundry.  Then I do my skin care and tooth care stuff, maybe take a quick shower.  Just generally spend that 30 minutes before bed putting my life in order.  I don't have trouble falling asleep, but I do have trouble waking up, so having everything already set up for me helps a lot in getting to the gym before work."
xxfitness,3e1e1h,ZincCadmium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:49 2015 UTC,"The issue with screen time is the light in your face, not sure what reading would do that's harmful.

xxfitness,3e1e1h,ProphetThief,4,Tue Jul 21 10:59:38 2015 UTC,"There is also research that a week camping (or otherwise sleeping outside/with sun lighting) resets melatonin and helps reset to a natural sleep cycle.  I read it on Reddit, and have no personal experience of it, but perhaps that could help if you have a week to spare :)  E: Also if you use your phone or whatever a lot, try downloading something like Twilight app for android, which gives a red filter and dims (adjustable) and is proven to help with regular sleep patterns. Lastly, and slightly more extreme, but perhaps redecorate/paint your bedroom? Some colours don't promote a good night's sleep or sleep pattern according to studies."

Once, I wound up resetting it because I was super fucking busy on a weekend and missed my nap, passed out at like midnight, my alarm went off at 7 and bam, I was back on an okay schedule (still took some time to be able to fall asleep before 1, but it was a huge improvement).  The other time I had to consciously get my butt in bed by 11pm, and put myself in situations where I could not nap in the evening (the gym, a walk, working at a coffee shop, anything like that) for about a week."

Are there fitness classes you can sign up for? Or make plans for the during the day? That way you have a ""reason"" to stay up during the day.   In regards to napping in the middle of the day, I LOVE naps, I try to nap even at work in my car. BUT, everything is a habit! If you feel yourself getting sleepy, go for a walk! Go splash water on your face, once that sleepy, drowsy feeling takes over, try to take your mind off it.  It won't be easy and you definitely won't be able to change your sleep schedule in a couple of days, or even a week. But if you consistently keep at it, your body will build that habit."

Like everything else at the gym, I'd imagine that the only real problem with accidentally going over the edge is internal embarrassment, as everyone else around you isn't paying close enough attention to notice."
xxfitness,3dyxp9,marylou5,10,Tue Jul 21 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"My time to shine! I had this happen in front of a lot of people not too long ago while I was doing hanging leg raises too; it might just be holding your legs together while lifting them causing friction around the clitoris. If it is that embarrassing for you, then switch to planks or knee raises and see if that helps, otherwise own it! Most people won't know any difference and you get to say that you had the most amazing workout ever."
xxfitness,3dyxp9,marylou5,6,Mon Jul 20 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I tried to see if it was pressure on my clitoris and it was not.  It was like the more I squeezed my lower abs, the more I felt like cumming. Maybe I was unintentionally also doing kegels at the same time."
xxfitness,3dyxp9,maiapriljune,4,Mon Jul 20 18:30:04 2015 UTC,"That could definitely be a possibility as well, especially with the peeing sensation that you described - I thought I had peed myself too at first. Either way, find an alternative exercise if you don't want that to happen again or just enjoy it and keep going. (sorry, bad wording)"

I've heard of the ""coregasm"" a bunch of times so I assure you it has happened to others and it's normal (alas, I'm not a member of the coregasm club). I think some people are just wired so there's a connection between their abs and sexual pleasure."
xxfitness,3dyxp9,Imjessiex,13,Mon Jul 20 19:06:13 2015 UTC,I don't have much of a six back or nice ab muscles but I do enjoy people touching my stomach. Maybe that's why.  This sub seems to hate this question. I've never been so downvoted before.

xxfitness,3dyxp9,rwfforever,5,Tue Jul 21 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"I get them when I am focusing on keeping my core tight during leg lifts, laying hamstring curls, and pull-ups. Sometimes they are avoidable (like I can feel it coming on and just rest for a minute or two), but sometimes it takes me by surprise. Don't make a big deal out of it. Act normal and take a short break and I don't think anyone will be any the wiser."
xxfitness,3dyxp9,OKaylaMay,5,Mon Jul 20 23:51:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I just don't want to make people at the gym uncomfortable or if it's even noticeable.

xxfitness,3e1dio,redrunner,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"I have been doing a modified version of Strong Curves at home, and have a long band and a short band of the same ""weight"".  To be honest I find myself using the miniband more nowadays and adding on circuits like this and exercises like these at the end of a workout/rest days and seeing great results. Off the top of my head, you can do sumo walks or any abduction movement to sub for x band walks, and maybe banded one legged hip thrusts to sub for regular ones. If it gets too easy you can always just add more reps, choose to do the more challenging exercises, or double up bands.   So if you're hesitant to buy new equipment try messing around with the bands you have first because there are tons of exercises to use them with. :) Message me if you need any ideas, as I've officially joined the crazy band lady club haha.  (Thanks for sharing that hip thrust video by the way--I have nothing to hook bands on so that's genius!)"

xxfitness,3dztem,bad_memory_bot,-5,Mon Jul 20 21:33:46 2015 UTC,140? that's nothing. :P  My ex-wife went from 135lbs pre-prego to 210 post-prego. lol  I still encourage her to keep at it. Though her current husband tries to condemn going to the gym.
xxfitness,3dztem,currypotnoodle,-5,Mon Jul 20 21:38:43 2015 UTC,"It really is nothing. OP maybe doesn't realize what normal weight gain during pregnancy is, but ten pounds post partum, after months of not working out, is quite unusual. I got down to pregnancy weight both times, but it took months of dedication to working out and dieting. And most (basically all) of my mommy friends are bigger now than they were pre-mommy.   Edit: so good job OP!"

It's a public place - it's definitely okay as long as you're respectful and lighthearted. There's absolutely nothing wrong with asking, ""would you like to grab a meal sometime?"" ... If he says no thanks just smile and move on and keep spotting each other. This culture has completely lost its grip on how to interact without every exchange being fraught af."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,RookToFMinor,5,Tue Jul 21 02:10:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking! I haven't dated in 15 years, but if I were now I would do exactly that. It sucks that life has to be so complicated ."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,staciloraine,7,Tue Jul 21 02:18:43 2015 UTC,"Haha I don't think it does! But so many people aren't comfortable enough around the etiquette of it, when in truth you can accomplish almost anything interpersonal if you just remember to be considerate, respectful and truthful."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,RookToFMinor,3,Tue Jul 21 02:21:49 2015 UTC,Yep! I wouldn't be offended anyone using those three guidelines asked me out and would have no problem with our future interactions. Now too bad no one has asked me out so I can give an anecdote or something!
xxfitness,3e0dpy,staciloraine,4,Tue Jul 21 02:35:00 2015 UTC,Aww I'd ask you out!
xxfitness,3e0dpy,RookToFMinor,2,Tue Jul 21 02:41:59 2015 UTC,Thanks!!!
xxfitness,3e0dpy,staciloraine,67,Tue Jul 21 02:50:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, because then you're jeopardizing the comfort of what should be a comfortable environment. If he says no and/or it turns out he has a girlfriend, etc, things could get pretty awkward.   What I would do, personally, is invite him to something. A not-necessarily-date. Does he hike? Get a conversation going with him about it and suggest checking out a hike together some time. Do you ever throw parties? Toss a casual invite his way. The best thing to do, in my opinion, is to work on becoming outside-of-the-gym friends before moving on to a date."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,GirlOverboard,13,Tue Jul 21 00:26:00 2015 UTC,"If you're already having light conversation with him you could always ask him if he wants to hang out outside the gym. That way you can get to know him more (whether he's single or not, what his interests are in addition to the gym) before committing to a date."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,MsCrane,4,Tue Jul 21 01:04:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this.  I wouldn't be all ""would you like to go on a date to dinner and a movie?""  Rather I'd see about grabbing coffee and go from there.  Worst case scenario, you make a new guy friend who happens to have a girlfriend.  Or he says no.  In either case, not awkward."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,j_j_b,13,Tue Jul 21 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"Eh.. I mean, the worst that happens is he says no. You could gauge interest by asking him to do something casual without thinking of it as date-date, like grab coffee after a workout or something."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,ekcunni,5,Tue Jul 21 00:24:41 2015 UTC,Do you know him? Is he comfortable with you? Ask him out.  Leave him alone otherwise. People don't go to the gym to be hit on.
xxfitness,3e0dpy,Sigseg,4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"I think you have to mentally prepare for all outcomes that may come from asking him out. Are you prepared for things to potentially get awkward between you two and you possibly losing your gym buddy? If you know this could happen and you still want to pursue a date with him, then I say you should just go for it in a tactful and friendly way. I don't think men or women really like to be hit on at the gym, but I do think that if you have a good connection and kind of know each other, then this is something different. Best of luck to you whatever you choose!"
xxfitness,3e0dpy,sevastra00,7,Tue Jul 21 06:13:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with another user's response here - I wouldn't ask someone out at the gym. The gym is supposed to be a comfortable place. A guy who works at my old gym asked me out one morning. Said he noticed me a few times. I declined and he took it well but I felt so out of sorts at that gym after that. I guess I got too comfortable and didn't think people actually notice each other to such an extent. After that incident, my guard was back up and I became way too aware of myself and people around me. I don't particularly want to be in that situation again. I'd rather just workout and get out of there.   That said, if you know him well and you are positive that he's showing interest, you could ask him for his number."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,MyTrouvaille,8,Tue Jul 21 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"Guy checking in here. If you have rapport with him find a casual way to see if he has a gf. Something like does your gf work out too? Now at least from what I hear girls say including my gf who gets hit on fairly frequently. When a guy asks a girl about a bf getting asked out is almost inevitable. Now typically girls get asked out way more times in their life than guys do so we're usually oblivious and just see it as conversation lol. If he says he's single you can still pull the trigger without looking like you're ""asking him out"" of you're worried about getting shot down..  Make it workout related talk about diet for example. Ask him if he usually eats anything post workout for example. Then go from there, maybe suggest hitting someplace after as a casual thing. Like I could really go for a (whatever to eat) after working out wanna grab a bite? Personally speaking I wouldn't feel awkward if a girl asked me out either way at the gym unless she got awkward after. Guys tend to find it more flattering I think to get asked out whereas girls deal with all types of guys and even if they're not creepy or any other type worry about being ""that guy"" in my opinion."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,thewrecker8,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:56 2015 UTC,"The general consensus is women do not want to be hit on at the gym, but men do. I would consider it exceedingly flattering. Like others have said the worst case scenario is that he says no."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,paladinkyle,3,Tue Jul 21 00:53:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you came to that conclusion. I agree with the top comment, she should ask him out for a friendly get together or something and see if they click then go from there. Nobody, man or woman, wants to deal with the potential awkwardness at their gym."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,rxchxrd,4,Tue Jul 21 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"I'd absolutely take a little awkwardness for a possible exciting new relationship/ new experience. In my experience, when you put too much of a premium on avoiding discomfort at all times, it  leads to a very cautious, boring life."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,RookToFMinor,3,Tue Jul 21 11:04:22 2015 UTC,"Just a trend i noticed from here, fitness, askmen, and askwomen."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,paladinkyle,6,Tue Jul 21 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"I think it depends, I wouldn't mind if it happened in a respectful way. but mostly men start bothering you mid workout when you're clearly not interested.   I do casually chat with some guys at the gym, if one of them ended up asking, I would say yes because they're nice and polite.  And if a guy was exceptionally hot and he asked mid workout, I would say yes too. Yes I can be superficial."
xxfitness,3e0dpy,nathaliew817,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:30 2015 UTC,I dont think its the general fact that they dont want to be asked so much as theres pretty much no existing relationship...
xxfitness,3e0dpy,go_nahuel,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:05 2015 UTC,I would probably 'snoop' around for more information. Do you know his full name? Look up his instagram/facebook/twitter accounts to see if he has a girlfriend beforehand.
xxfitness,3e0dpy,immamuffin,10,Tue Jul 21 02:02:00 2015 UTC,Please don't do this. You shouldn't have to snoop around to find things out about people. Ask him for a coffee. Stalking behind his back is a bit creepy.
xxfitness,3e0dpy,ayshasmysha,2,Tue Jul 21 10:47:39 2015 UTC,"Stalking? Who doesn't do that? I'm not telling her to find out his entire life, I'm merely suggesting it to find out if he has a girlfriend or not. She's clearly concerned about whether he's even available or interested. This will answer a few questions."

xxfitness,3e0dpy,TripleUltraMini,15,Tue Jul 21 00:45:14 2015 UTC,Many people find this approach cringe-inducing because it's as direct as asking someone out (or asking whether they're taken) while attempting to be indirect.
xxfitness,3e0dpy,cryogenetik,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:48 2015 UTC,But it works on TV!  I agree my exact question above is a bit cringe-worthy but you can be more sly about it.
xxfitness,3e0dpy,TripleUltraMini,0,Tue Jul 21 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"I would wait until he's done his workout and getting ready to leave, in order to ask. I'd also make sure I was aware of all possible outcomes. He could say no, the date could be horrible, etc."

xxfitness,3dz7lp,Nightrabbit,35,Mon Jul 20 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"Not only was that a dick move, but someone could have been injured. I hate being a tattle-tell, but I would at least say something to a worker. Not accusing anyone since you can't prove it, but just something like, ""Hey, just so you know someone removed a plate from the bar while I was between sets and not looking. I just want to let you know because someone could get hurt.""  Then I would watch that douche like a hawk."
xxfitness,3dz7lp,ShelinStL,10,Mon Jul 20 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I went in the morning but I usually go in the afternoon, so I've never seen him before. I might say something to mgmt tomorrow just so they have it on record."
xxfitness,3dz7lp,ShelinStL,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:36 2015 UTC,I think that is a good idea. I bet he's done this before and will do it again.
xxfitness,3dz7lp,MrsDoeJaneDoe,7,Tue Jul 21 00:52:42 2015 UTC,I don't get why people do things like this when a simple question could suffice. I agree with u/ShelinStL - something like this could lead to an injury. I've seen it almost happen; the guy went to bench but the bar tipped cause of the imbalance. A guy next to him had apparently grabbed a plate from one side to add to his stack and hadn't even mentioned it. Glad you weren't hurt!
xxfitness,3dz7lp,arnoldthemountain,8,Mon Jul 20 19:58:14 2015 UTC,"Did you go somewhere between sets? If I leave, to get a drink of water or something, I always check to make sure no one messed with my weights before continuing. Sometimes it's hard to tell if someone left for a second or just didn't re-rack."
xxfitness,3dz7lp,amandakesselisbest,9,Mon Jul 20 19:49:42 2015 UTC,That's part of what makes me so furious about people who don't rerack!
xxfitness,3dz7lp,RookToFMinor,6,Mon Jul 20 21:42:46 2015 UTC,Could it have been an accident? I've pulled plates off of someone's smith machine bar without realizing just because I wasn't paying attention. You could have just inquired as to whether he'd slipped up.
xxfitness,3dz7lp,mahi-mahi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've done the accidental pulling of plates from someone's machine in between their sets. Especially on smith machines and leg presses, where nobody ever seems to deload (and there are no clips) so if there's nobody at the machine you have no way to know they're being used. So yeah, it can totally happen by accident."

xxfitness,3dz7lp,spacecadetdani,5,Mon Jul 20 22:14:22 2015 UTC,"Super dick move, but maybe he thought you were done with the bar and wasn't paying attention when you got back? Idk, not 'fessing up when you looked at him makes him seem ball-less, so the kicking him in the balls thing wouldn't have worked anyway. Sorry this happened! Glad no one got hurt."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,melodywilding,5,Mon Jul 20 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"I can't help with your actual question, but if your goal is a frugal option for greek yogurt I highly recommend making your own. It's cheap and easy."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,AtomikRadio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:36 2015 UTC,"Oh that article is great, thanks for the link! I'd been thinking of making my own yogurt and that might have tipped the scales to the 'yes do this' side."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,Sinadia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:24 2015 UTC,"I just did it in the slow cooker following instructions from this site:  http://www.daringgourmet.com/2015/01/21/easy-homemade-greek-yogurt/  It tastes really good, but it was a messy process. I probably strained it for a bit too long so it was really thick. I made about two big 175g tubs for the price of a 4L bag of skim milk ($4 for the $16 worth of yogurt).  I also used some probiotics that I take to help with, ahem, protein toots. It worked really well, better than the probiotics work on their own.  I'm probably going to keep doing this just because it tastes better than the stuff I normally get in store and because I really like my really thick yogurt."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,GamesForGustav,4,Tue Jul 21 22:40:03 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the Costco in East Harlem? I have a membership there, but it's been ages since I bought a ton of Fage and I don't remember if they still carry it exactly. There's also a Target in the same mall, but yeah.  Edit: I had to get some stuff at Costco today and checked - indeed Fage 0% is $6.49 for a 3lb tub there in case you decide to get a membership."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,ariannemartell,3,Tue Jul 21 00:44:31 2015 UTC,"Hello - fellow NYC-er addicted to Fage (no chobani or anything else allowed).  I discovered recently that Trader Joe's 0% plain greek yogurt has virtually the same taste and even has 10 calories less per serving - but most importantly, it's MUCH cheaper than Fage - which as you know, is typically 8 bucks-ish for the big cartons here in NYC.  The TJ's one, however, is a few dollars less per carton - can't remember exactly how much (I want to say 5 something per carton or less).  Headed over there on my lunch break today to stock up.  Edit: It's 4.99 for the big 36 ounce bucket, which typically costs $7.50-$8.50 for Fage."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,phoequel,3,Tue Jul 21 15:53:14 2015 UTC,Trader Joe's Greek Yogurt is actually Stonyfield yogurt if you're ever curious.
xxfitness,3e0d2t,mmemmetee,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"WOW this just blew my mind, really?  Thanks for letting me know - now I'll have another option in case I can't make it to a TJ's!"
xxfitness,3e0d2t,phoequel,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:23 2015 UTC,Glad to help haha. I always like to try to figure out the name brand suppliers to TJ brands. I love TJ.
xxfitness,3e0d2t,mmemmetee,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:23 2015 UTC,I always like to try to figure out the name brand suppliers to TJ brands.   I didn't even know this was a thing.  WHAT?  I thought it all came from Trader Joe's magic island.  What else in there is name brand?
xxfitness,3e0d2t,phoequel,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"Everything that has the Trader Joe's brand on it is from a name brand. That's how Trader Joe's has such cheap stuff. They get their products from name brands but slaps their own name on it. I hear that some of the name brand tweaks the recipe here and there but not by much. I usually figure it out from the packaging because some times the packaging is almost identical except the names. Their pita chips are by Stacy's. I believe that their boxed soups/broths are from Imagine or Pacific. Their mac n cheese is Annie's. There's more but I can't remember them off the top of my head. Every once in a while, a produce supplier will give Trader Joe's some produce with their sticker on it. I saw a bag of avocados at TJ for $3ish and the same brand at WF for $6ish. I was shocked."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,mmemmetee,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:29 2015 UTC,Have you tried Fresh Direct? I loved FD so much when I lived in Manhattan.
xxfitness,3e0d2t,artificial_grape,2,Tue Jul 21 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, Fresh Direct is the answer. You can buy a case of 12 individual cups, which works out to $3.63/lb, or even cheaper is the 35.3 oz tub ($3.25/lb).  If you've never used Fresh Direct before, make sure to sign up with a referral code or coupon -- you can almost always get free delivery and a large discount on your first order."
xxfitness,3e0d2t,aminoacyl,3,Tue Jul 21 15:39:59 2015 UTC,It's NYC; I'm sure you could PAY someone to buy it for you and deliver it right to your apartment.

xxfitness,3e1030,bromeliadi,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:25 2015 UTC,"Not a problem.  The issues discussed in the article /u/idamayer shared are not so much about strength imbalances, but rather overuse.  That's a different issue, and a serious one.  Having your pulling muscles be much stronger than your pushing muscles is not, in and of itself, a bad thing, and, to a certain extent, is desirable.  Among other things, it reduces the chance of impingement injuries.  Remember that we are descended from brachiating apes, for whom pulling strength was very important and pushing strength not very important at all."
xxfitness,3e1030,Hotblack_Desiato_,3,Tue Jul 21 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"I am also an aerialist! I did exactly what you are doing! I got chronic tendonitis and had to take 6 months off of training and am nowhere near as strong as I was.  You will grow the muscles on the backs of your shoulders much more than the front and that will push your shoulders forward in their sockets. Then exercises that put strain on your shoulders will do so while your shoulders are slightly misaligned and put undue stress on your tendons. Some of this can be mitigated by being very conscious and intentional with your form, but I really recommend you don't ignore the imbalance.  Other more knowledgeable people on the internet have written about this as well"
xxfitness,3e1030,idamayer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome link. Thank you so much.   The funny thing is, I had heard the opposite: if you overdevelop  the muscles in your front (and not back), they will make your shoulders tight by pulling them forwards. Perhaps they are both true.   What about legs? Any ideas there? I know about chicken legs but it's totally not that severe lol"
xxfitness,3e1030,ribbonprincess,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:27 2015 UTC,"Fellow aerialist here! I just cross train my legs on my non-aerials days. It's boring, I know, but it helps with straight leg inverts quite a bit, so totally worth it. Also, if you want to keep your pushing and pulling muscles balanced, you can always work on handstands! It's a great sort-of-aerials way of working those pushing muscles."
xxfitness,3e1030,idamayer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:02:48 2015 UTC,"Handstands is a great idea and I have been training them a lot recently! Blah, okay, I will do legs. Thank you :)"
xxfitness,3e1030,idamayer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:02 2015 UTC,"That also sounds likely. I guess I can't picture your shoulders riding out of the socket backwards, so maybe any uneven forces on the shoulder end up push/pulling them forwards...  I have no idea about legs. If it helps I have no leg muscles to speak of...  Btw, what apparatus(es) do you practice? (also come join us at /r/aerials?)"
