America may not have heard of him yet, but he is considerably more famous than Billie Piper (although nowhere near as well liked).  A messy divorce would have been career suicide for her.  Im not saying she doesnt believe what she said, I just dont believe she would have had the alternative to take him for all he was worth.  Professionally speaking."
todayilearned,3dyap4,doraemon86,15,Mon Jul 20 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"A messy divorce would have been career suicide for her.   They separated in 2004 and officially divorced in 2007.

I highly doubt if she chose to fight it, it would have been a career suicide."

She was starting to build her own success as an actress, after a short lived but reasonably successful career as a solo artist.  She wasnt, however, a multi millionaire with over a decade of experience of prime time TV and the owner of her own production company.  Hubby dearest was.  I realise you cannot compare the two properly, but look at what happened with Heather Mills.  She was only famous as a model, but she wasnt exactly unpopular.  Then she took Paul for everything she could in the divorce.  Now she couldnt be popular with the British public if she resurrected Linda McCartney and cured her cancer."
todayilearned,3dyap4,mellamojay,15,Mon Jul 20 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"There is a HUGE difference between taking him for all hes worth and taking what is totally within your right. Heather Mills is hated because she tried to take EVERYTHING. If Billie just took a little bit that would have never even registered in the media. She instead took nothing because that is what she believed in... If you think she didn't take anything because of her beginning a career you are sorely mistaken. If she wanted, she could of taken her half with no problem and became a star."

Heather Mills was an exception, in my opinion, though I do not know her personally, she came off as a gold digger during the divorce and that's what hurt her the most.   and I seriously doubt Billie, or most decent people, would be as crazy as Heather Mills if they wanted a divorce settlement/alimony. Heather was a nut case. Paul must have been the guy who was given an opportunity to kill baby hitler but chose not to in a past life, to have had Heather Mills in this one."

While being married these spouses typically lose marketability for the marketplace because they were cooking, housekeeping, etc.  When these spouses could have been gaining a education, or developing important job skills.

In fact, I would agree that it would be disgusting for them to squabble over who gets how-many-millions.

They may keep the house, tend to the children, prepare meals and even handle finances while the husband earns the cash.  That makes it harder to be so ""noble"" in the event of a divorce.  I can imagine that many women in that position even feel disgusted with themselves for being cast as the ""money grubbing ex"", but without it how would they live, and all because they made the choice with their partner to not be the literal breadwinner.

Most people here don't understand that being a stay at home parent is a huge sacrifice, and that being a mother can end your career.

The father went on and became a pretty famous surgeon while the mother didn't work A DAY using her medical career. They had very isolated roles; dad went and worked and made money, mom took care of the children, the house, the chores, etc.   So if the scenario came up that after 30 years they god divorced, I would absolutely expect that she'd get a nice chunk of change. Even though she has a medical degree she didn't work a single day as a doctor, and now she's in her 60's. Her ability to get any kind of job at this point is pretty out of the question, especially considering one of HER kids (16 years old) had a kid and she is the de facto parent of that little baby as well. She gave up her career and her independent livelihood to further that of her husband's. She is entitled to $$$."
