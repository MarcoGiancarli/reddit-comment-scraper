pakistan,3e32c3,Cream1213,19,Tue Jul 21 16:06:35 2015 UTC,IMO the youth is becoming more polarized. Some turn to religion as an answer and others are disenfranchised by it. It'll be interesting to see what happens next.  But I do feel that the state/establishment now realizes that their overzealous Islamization policies have led to extremism and are toning them down.
pakistan,3e32c3,squarerootof-1,7,Tue Jul 21 17:36:16 2015 UTC,It doesn't feel like the government realizes that. The medical school I go to really tries their hardest to push religious dogma down our throat. Is it really that polarized I mean one of my very good friends in pakistan is called molvi sab because he prays 5 times a day but he is very accepting of my kafirness haha.

pakistan,3e32c3,ahyuknyuk,2,Tue Jul 21 18:48:45 2015 UTC,That's so weird you would think the sciences would attract the less religious people. Doesn't it get hard to be in a major where you constantly have to justify your beliefs with science.

The key for religions is to ensure that the ""miracles"" are unfalsifiable. If a person is miraculously sleeping in a cave for 3000 yrs, no one can disprove it.

The government is so over-religious and conservative that it makes those who question it frustrated.   I think a big part of the problem is we are only getting the Saudi-sponsored Wahhabi version of Islam imported into Pakistan. There's people all over the world with different ways of practicing Islam in their culture. Forget the Middle East, just look to Central Asia. In this excellent documentary Meet the Stans, the host and the journalist go to a Muslim fortune teller in Uzbekistan who uses the Quran to predict fortunes. They all end with a short ""Bismillah"" lol. Later he's in Tajikistan, also an Islamic country with majority Sunnis, joining a group of officials for dinner at a Tajik border post who openly served (lots of) vodka with their kabaabs. They all end the feast with a short thanks to Allah. According to Wikipedia, only 10% of Tajiks follow daily prayer. Contrast these facts with what people are raised with in Pakistan.   It was eye opening to me how Islamic cultures can be so different in Pakistan's own backyard and not many know about it. All we get is Arabic being mandatory in govt. schools to further kiss Saudi's ass."

American Pakistanis tend to be less religious.  The irony is that America is a more religious country than Britain or European countries. Some of the most religious Pakistanis I have met have been from Norway and Demark, which are practically atheist countries.   Edit: I would say, middle and lower middle class Pakistanis from Europe, Canada and Britain are more religious than upper and upper middle class Pakistanis living in Pakistan."

Its a pizza - did you think Pakistan invented some new way, completely different from the rest of the world, for delivering pizza? Or are you surprised that Pakistanis would be eating pizza? Or is it the recycled material used in some of the packaging, which also started happening about 10-15 years ago? I'm sorry but wtf man?  It gets incredibly insulting to read such often well-intentioned and earnest questions, simply because they start from this really strange idea of Pakistan in the first place.

We are merely keeping them ""safe"" from big bad India   (which isn't wrong mind you, it's just that we aren't that altruistic as we like to claim)  Which is why GB can't be part of Pakistan, since it destroys the narrative.

I mean, sure, there are loads of Kashmiris who want to be Pakistanis, but the two damning facts are that (1) the entire Kashmir struggle is based on Independence, NOT a merger with Pakistan and (2) a significant proportion of Kashmiris a support this idea. (Specifically, the ones in IHK, the one in AJK have become more used to with the status quo as an area with greater autonomy)  I'm not one to force people to join Pakistan when they don't want to, but we need to understand that ""Kashmir Azad Karein gey"" and ""Kashmir Ban Key Rahe Ga Pakistan"" are two DIFFERENT ideas.

There might have been a large element in the Militancy that wanted to join with Pakistan and that was used as propaganda by the GOI. But majority of Kashmiris that are against Indian rule now do want Independence and most Indians know that in spite of the Government propaganda. Its also why the stars of Separatists groups like Hurryat etc are not so bright in Pakistan, because they( the groups) had to go along with the people and also ask for independence ( otherwise it would seem they didn't have the people's support in their efforts) and asking for independence, for Pakistan is a future headache of major proportions.  Unfortunately you are right in that, when the Militants targeted  the KP ethnicity, they really alienated themselves and any support for the Kashmiris' struggle in India evaporated. And with the KP diaspora having to settle in all parts of India and people hearing stories, first hand, about what the militants did only hardened them and provided excellent propaganda for GOI.( The atrocities committed by the military on the Kashmiri population was mostly suppressed at the time).  Now I fear it might be worse. In recent years money has gone into Kashmir, tourists have come, colleges, schools have opened, new jobs are opening, but if there is another flair up The GOI, cheered on by the Indian people, hardened, will go for blood like never before.(Especially in the current international atmosphere, where the insurgents will be equated with ISIS and will get no international support/blind eye to what the GOI does there)"

pakistan,3dy29c,TotallyNotObsi,3,Mon Jul 20 17:22:33 2015 UTC,Two years ago people were using the same argument against a military operation in FATA. The fact of the matter is that this logic is basically blackmail by the terrorists. I dont care HOW they kill him and how they destroy the Lal Masjid.

Even Indians (or comments I've read online from Indians) use it in a derogatory manner (though I'm not sure of their intentions). Regardless, you don't hear it very often when referred to Pakistani people, if you do hear it said in a non-racist manner, like how Australians are called Aussies, those who are aware of this derogatory term laugh at it, (e.g. Pakisaurus reference in Jurassic World movie) so it doesn't really catch on."

pakistan,3dzfuc,iSmellBiryani,5,Tue Jul 21 00:04:10 2015 UTC,Pak means pure in Urdu. So Pakistan means land of the pure

pakistan,3dtn0w,br0cket,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"As far as I know military service is not what it used to be. They have hired too many commissioned officers and saturated the force. This results in lower post with a higher rank ( eg. If a captain used to lead 100 men in the past, he now leads 10 and a major or higher leads 100).  Also the benefits aren't that great any more. Eg, when someone retired from the navy after 23 years of service, they used to get a house in the NHS for around Rs 250K, now it's around 750K and no one can afford that. So people end up selling the allotment files.  So, in my opinion it's a good job from someone coming from a relatively poor back ground.   I'd advice against it op.  Feel free to ask any more questions."
pakistan,3dtn0w,lalafied,2,Mon Jul 20 07:00:07 2015 UTC,"By the time you graduate you won't be eligible for long commission and short commission has very small chances of rising up the ranks, so its not worth it.  So don't bother thinking about joining."
pakistan,3dtn0w,lalafied,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:06:02 2015 UTC,Could you explain the difference between long and short commission? I've heard radio ads describing short commission in six months but beyond that I have nothing.
pakistan,3dtn0w,lalafied,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"Long commission is when you join after high school and the army trains you and makes you attend their own colleges for further education.   Short commission is when you join after completing your Bachelors or masters and go straight into service after attending PMA for 6 months(or a year, not sure).  So, in long commission they think of you as their own/ feel like they raised you from the start which makes it easy to progress. Short commissioned officers are unlikely to go beyond major, might make colonel if you are really good and get lucky ."

pakistan,3dtn0w,Shaanistan,2,Mon Jul 20 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"In the exact same boat. Grew up outside Pakistan, wanted to enlist straight outta highscool, parents shut me up and said to go to university first hoping I'd grow out of the phase. Got a year of uni left (in Canada) and its still looking attractive to me. Honestly, besides the defence.pk forum, all I have to give me an idea on PMA life are a couple of youtube videos. My father can only tell me about his time period which according to him was very different."
pakistan,3dtn0w,Shaanistan,4,Sun Jul 19 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"Man, my dad was in the 98th percentile for the Rawalpindi board pre-medical FSC back in 1972 when he was at Hasan Abdal. He was guaranteed a spot at PMA Kakul, but my grandfather simply refused to sign the registration papers. Bangladesh had just happened and he was in no mood at that point in time for his son to join what many thought was a broken, dismembered institution. Sent him to King Edward for medicine instead.  My dad's views of the army are mixed because while he doesn't enjoy coups his most loyal saarji waleh dost are commissioned generals or slightly below. I don't know what he'd say to me requesting such a thing because he's invested a lot of time and money into making Canada our home.  By enlisting in the army, from a socioeconomic perspective, I'm throwing away a lot of opportunities out West. And even with commission, there are only so many officers who can be made Lt. Generals. I'd basically be swapping the life my folks have already built for me for bondage to the Fauj with no idea of where I'll end up on the ladder."
pakistan,3dtn0w,Shaanistan,3,Sun Jul 19 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"The giving up of foreign citizenship would probably be the biggest opportunity cost. All those aspects do seem daunting and I'm pretty sure expats like us would be like fish out of water but it's the most disciplined and most well run institution in the country so it doesn't really seem like that of a reckless option. Plus there are several avenues one could take through the military. Defence industry, Intelligence, become a diplomat. Maybe foreign education people who've been exposed to different perspectives would be of an asset to the military thinktank. Of course one would have to put in their hard yards to be able to gain the most out of the profession (just like anywhere else)."
pakistan,3dtn0w,karachikhatmal,3,Sun Jul 19 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a reckless option, you're right. Unless you pull an AQ Khan or something.  As for the post-retirement roles you mentioned, that's also another factor that makes it seem interesting to me. Even when in uniform there are several avenues to build yourself professionally apart from just being a career soldier, especially based on whatever technical skills you gained at university. This gets into the murky, allegedly corrupt side of the military business complex in terms of industries, businesses, and land swapping hands, but we'll never know unless we actually make it to that stage whether it's clean or not.  At the end of the day, just being in uniform for the country's last-remaining institution that does its job somewhat properly is what draws me to it all."
pakistan,3dtn0w,Zazazakana,3,Sun Jul 19 20:41:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Even if I'm going to be sitting on a desk doing something menial, I'd rather do it as part of the Pakistan Army than some random company in a random country"

pakistan,3dtn0w,Striker_X,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"This thread is pretty interesting and props to OP for having a pretty objective view of the army. My question though is how does this institution seem like the best choice for serving the country?  The army in Pakistan is bloated and involved in sectors beyond its brief. It is a massive institution and a parha likha guy will leave it with properties and connections and at the very least a post in Bahria Town. Connections with the army are the strongest card in most legal and social situations. The army takes very questionable decisions in Balochistan and FATA and has no qualms with letting Shia killers take out rallies in its name.   Now I know you are aware of those issues and can point me to how they've done good. But institutionally speaking, in a country as heterogenous as Pakistan, a centralising force acting above the reach of the country not only creates tensions which are often violent but also systematically weakens the other institutions even when it means well.   The biggest question is that how does contributing to warfare help a nation progress or have peace? I can understand wanting to do it for the money, for the adrenaline, for family tradition.   I do hope you get a chance to answer since you've given some pretty good replies on here."

So give a thought to the cultural gap and fitting in.  As for being an officer in PA I can't give you any advice but there's an adage that fauj is for those who have rich families that can supplement your income or for those looking for social mobility. For everyone else there are better options.    Dunno if that does anything for you . Personally I reckon you can serve pakistan  better in other capacities than as a  fauji afsar ."

I understand what you're saying. There're plenty of things that would frustrate me while living here. I already know the subtleties and complexities; like the need to be a sycophant to get ahead, our judgemental behaviour, a severe lack of privacy, materialism, stratified classism, etc. I'm at the point where I can easily ignore it.   As for social mobility, I don't need any as is Alhamdulillah. I go to university with an employable major and I have the resources for graduate school. That being said the part of the adage I don't fulfill is supplementing income; there's no business empire in my family, and I can't afford to simply eat my father's money for the rest of his life. Thanks for pointing this out, it puts things in perspective.   At the same time, I've always wanted to return to Pakistan to actually live and work here. For the past two generations our ties to the country are slowly diminishing by studying and working abroad, and by the time I'm an adult there'll be very little, if absolutely nothing left behind.   I'm just not sure of the avenues one can take to move back and live here permanently, and be a professional at an income level at which my parents and grandparents won't scorn me for choosing to move back in the first place. I'm tired of all the moving and flying around that dual-citizens and expatriates engage in (like I've had to do all my life)."

pakistan,3dt5iz,tranqu,2,Sun Jul 19 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"Never understood this. You can do the same things in Pakistan and the GCC that you can do in the West, and if you raise your child in the expatriate bubble, they can do it even more discretely."
pakistan,3dt5iz,IzmailPirzada,3,Sun Jul 19 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean as many expat kids in GCC can be spoiled, but I'd want to raise my kids in the GCC for a few years. By that I mean getting a job package there for myself (not just depriving them of a father for a few years as u/tranqu mentioned. That doesn't do any good for the kids wtf?) and putting kids in private American schooling. The Gulf is sort of a middle ground between Pakistan (very conservative) and America (very liberal). I'm thinking a few years in GCC will encourage the kids to appreciate the freedoms of Western society more and how to best take advantage of it while not being totally out-of-control spoiled as the Defence kids of Pakistan. It would also teach them how religion doesn't have to be intrusive in daily life as people in GCC can be relatively laid back about it. Partly for these reasons I'm thankful I was raised in the GCC before moving to America."
pakistan,3dt5iz,txs2300,5,Sun Jul 19 22:09:31 2015 UTC,Do Indians in US/Canada also lock themselves in mosque/mandir communities like Pakistanis do?  I never see Indians that disconnected from mainstream society like some Pakistanis do.
pakistan,3dt5iz,khanabadoshi,2,Sun Jul 19 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot where in the US you live. I'd say in Canada from my limited experiences, all the Desis of similar economic status live in the same areas and mingle.  In the east coast of the US, most Pakistanis and Indians don't mix with each other, but they do mingle with everyone else. There aren't many ""country-specific"" neighborhoods. Indians are far more westernized and fit in much better in school, work, and social activities. Especially if they were born here. Pakistani kids born in the US have a hard time fitting in, balancing conservative expectations of parents -- essentially, everything about life is haraam -- so they go to school, come home, go to masjid, repeat. Sense of Muslim community is strong, as we are so few. Any random Muslim passes you -- black, white, arab, asian -- a good chance they'll say salaam. In Pakistan, you don't think too much about being Muslim, in the US everyone reminds you. This makes many people start acting more Muslim. If you have relatives in the States you might notice that who wore dupatta before, wears hijab now. Etc.   That's just one segment of the population though. The other segment is completely arreligious and has abandoned most of the cultural and religious practices. These people will put on a song and dance for when they visit Pakistan or if entertaining a conservative crowd. However, they came to America to embrace assimilation and so they should. This type of person is most commonly ambitious politically or in the corporate sector. They need to fit the mold of those roles in order to move ahead in their goals.   In denser areas with large Muslim populations, like Chicago, there is very little effort made to interact with non-Pakistanis or non-Indian Muslims. There is no need to learn English as most people run little businesses and live in close knit communities. The masjids all do khutbas in Urdu, doesn't matter that Arabs or Kazakhs or Somalis are coming to pray. They also shun mixing with other Muslims unless they believe exactly as they do. Big Desi v. Arab rivalry in terms of masjids, Eid, community outreach, etc. So they end up segregating and forming own masjids. Lot's of division.   These are very broad brush strokes. But most Pakistanis fit in the spectrum of these groups. A lot is dependent upon when you immigrated, where to, how wealthy, how educated, how religious. Generally, everyone settled in the 70s and 80s speaks English and is upper middle-class, very well-settled, religious/or not, interacts with society, does not associate with Hindus, and aware of the culture of other Muslim immigrants. Their children, don't speak Urdu well, battle between conservatism/liberalism (but always are acha bacha for parents), study hard, career-oriented, and get good jobs. Not for the sake of anything more than to just be independent of their parents and the constant pressure. These kids will not marry back home, they will marry amongst themselves, this is the generation that you'll find mixed Desi-Arab-Bengali-Somali-Turk etc couples.    blah blah blah. I don't know why I typed all that I'm tired. LOL  You get the point, I'm sure."

Pakistani folks (middle class Punjabis) seems to be very religious in comparisons to Indians (non-Muslims) and more religious than Indian Muslims.   Also, being non-alcoholic made them less inclined to after-work get-togethers and social events.

Though, honestly drinking and being slightly drunk makes things more lively. Hence drunk people can enjoy a party for hours. IMO, it will be impossible for a fully sober person to enjoy a party at 3am!    some Muslims feel restricted in choices of food,   Many Indians have bigger restrictions on food.

A few moments later, a white woman is walking on the sidewalk with a large backback and he exclaims, that he doesn't understand that how people who are born here are are such losers and lazy with no goals, they dont take advantage of citizenship etc etc... to which, another taxi driver replies, ""they spend half their life doing drugs"".

We are bombarded with words such as ‘racist’ and ‘Islamophobic’ if we say anything less than stellar about the growing immigrant populations in the West.    I really think this paragraph is problematic, and untrue. There is a difference between rejecting prejudice, and not discussing real issues in the community. Growing up in an immigrant area, my teachers would often discuss the issues of students and their culture (and yes these teachers were white andoften grossly misinformed, though not always so), and growing up involved in the non-profit community, as well as working in it now, this is also constantly discussed. Look at a lot of immigrant media, for example youtubers and other internet discussions or memes around immigrant issues--they often focus around immigrant issues and talk about them. As well, the khutbahs at my mosque constantly talk about these different issues, and some of the most successful islamic speakers talk about these things (Nakshawani, NAK, Suhaibb).  Rejecting prejudice and stereotypes (btw,   Mostly elderly men or women, wearing traditional garments from their home countries, smiling while proudly holding their granddaughter in their arms, who is also dressed in some sort of an ethnic attire. Very often the setting takes place at some sort of a religious venue, maybe a mosque or a temple,   is definitely a problematic stereotype that harms people, and our communities) does not mean we can't also talk about the issues in the community.  I honestly don't get people who act as if recognizing that Islamophobia exists and combating it means we are saying we're perfect, and not able to deal with any of our own issues.  You have some good points, but I really disagreed with this."

The Indo-Tibetan Border Police also deployed the UAV on 24 June in remote locations like Kedarnath, Bhairav Chatti and Jungle Chatti to spot survivors.   From the DRDO Netra's Wikipedia page, it's definitely not for the exclusive use of special forces. You can agree to disagree with /u/TotallyNotObsi but you're still wrong."
pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,2,Sat Jul 18 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"I said special forces and any ground based teams. I also mentioned that they are used to ""assist"" such teams on the ground. If you read your own post that is exactly how they are being used.  Nowhere is it mentioned that Netra is used in ""battlefield surveillance"" role."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,4,Sat Jul 18 21:07:18 2015 UTC,There is nothing to disagree with. Tactical drones are used by all competent militaries for battlefield surveillance.   Even for India:  http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories3087_Homeland_Security_turns_to_UAVs_in_India.htm  http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/aviation-assets-for-indias-paramilitary-forces-10879-748417.html
pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,2,Sat Jul 18 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"Ok buddy. If Indian army is using a Chinese off the shelf drone for cross border ""battlefield surveillance then in my books they are not a competent military.  Why can't you at least entertain the possibility that Pakistan army either shot its own drone or some rich kids drone?"
pakistan,3dqke1,Thelog0,5,Sat Jul 18 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"yes India  a country that has state of the art  satellite imaging, successfully sent spaceships to Mars and imports high tech multi million dollar Israeli hypersonic drones which are literally built for stealth in covert ops,   sent a lousy Rs 80000  slow noisy toy that has a max 2kms  range &   easily visible  to SPY  on Pakistan military."
pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,7,Sat Jul 18 21:06:58 2015 UTC,Hypersonic?? Really dude??
pakistan,3dqke1,thealphamale1,13,Sat Jul 18 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"yes India  a country that has state of the art  satellite imaging,    I can believe you when you say India has satellite imaging, but state of the art? Lol, no.    imports high tech multi million dollar Israeli hypersonic drones which are literally built for stealth in covert ops,    I'm guessing you pulled that out your arse. India doesn't have any hypersonic drones, and israel doesn't produce any. Please do show me one of these hypersonic drones that you claim India possesses though."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,6,Sat Jul 18 20:23:14 2015 UTC,India is spying on Pakistan from Mars through the use of specially developed lens by DRDO. Their border force has now no use for small tactical drones because they have a chip embedded into their skulls that gives them this satellite imagery.

pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,4,Sat Jul 18 17:59:05 2015 UTC,"Ok I don't agree with the hypersonic drone nonsense, but Indian surveillance satellites are quite advanced by Asian military standards.  India has about 35 years of experience in designing, launching and operating remote sensing satellites."
pakistan,3dqke1,thealphamale1,3,Sat Jul 18 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"If it's by South Asian standards, then I can agree that India probably has some good satellites (definitely not state-of-the-art though), I assume you meant South Asia; since Asia also consists of Russia and China, both of which I'm sure possess far greater satellite technology than India."
pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,-2,Sat Jul 18 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"Russia yes, but they don't have the money to invest in researching next Gen spy satellites. As far as the surveillance satellites technology goes, the gap between India and China is not that large. Yes China is able to field more satellites but the gap in technological capability is not that large.  Part of the reason is that India has been able to collaborate with Russia, US and Israel over the years. Plus as I mentioned before India has had extensive experience in working with remote sensing."
pakistan,3dqke1,thealphamale1,4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"But that still doesn't show how it's state-of-the-art (if you were trying to say it is) or advanced by 'Asian military standards', the US (and even Israel) would never share their most advanced satellite technology with anyone else.  China also has it's own satellite navigation system (India's is currently in development), there is definitely a technology gap, and is definitely a big one. China also literally has trillions in the bank - they can develop good technology (it's not like they're all money and no brains).  As for Russia, they may not have enough money now, but their sat. technology is already advanced. I think you're being far too generous to say India's technology comes close to any of them.   edit: spelling."
pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,0,Sat Jul 18 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"It comes close to China. You are in fact over estimating Chinese capabilities. You mentioned the Chinese satellite navigation system. Do you know that the Indian regional navigation satellite system will be fully deployed by this year end? (All the constellation satellites are being launched this year).   And on the matter of sharing cutting edge technology. Need I direct you to Brahmos missile? It's currently one of the best cruise missiles in the world built with Indian Russian collaboration.  How about the Barak missile defense system. One of the best ship based missile defense system in the world built with Israeli Indian collaboration.  So cutting edge technology is shared. Especially with close allies.  Edit: Forgot to add, Russia's PAK FA 5th Gen fighter program in which India is a partner and getting access to the technology. There are numerous areas that even the US has identified for cutting edge technological cooperation in recent talks."
pakistan,3dqke1,thealphamale1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"China currently has 17 satellites in space, it's been available for use to the public since 2012, and will eventually have 35 satellites. India will have 7 satellites - so once complete, India will still have less than half the number of satellites than China has right now.  Brahmos is a missile, collaboration to make a good missile doesn't mean there'll be any collaboration to make advanced satellite technology. Even the US will actually sell you many of it's missiles, but never it's satellites.  The same applies for the Barak thing.  The US (which undeniably has the most advanced satellite technology in the world - and that's what the discussion was about, not missiles) would never share it with India - India isn't a close ally of the US. The Five Eyes are. Satellite technology is one of those things where countries would rather no-one else knows just how far their capabilities extend, sharing that technology, even with close allies, doesn't really happen."
pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,2,Sat Jul 18 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"So basically you are saying is that Russia, Israel and US will give India cutting edge technology in all areas but satellite technology? That argument is weak. I have you three cutting edge technology collaborations just off the top of my head.  And as far as the number of satellites go. I have started very clearly that China can launch more satellites than India. Indian space budget is a fraction of the Chinese. But keep in mind, China's landmass is 3 times the size of India. So obviously they require more satellites.  Second, and the point I am trying to make is, once the system is operational the technological capability gap between bediou 1 and the IRNSS is going to be very small."
pakistan,3dqke1,thealphamale1,2,Sat Jul 18 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"So basically you are saying is that Russia, Israel and US will give India cutting edge technology in all areas but satellite technology? That argument is weak. I have you three cutting edge technology collaborations just off the top of my head.   Like I said, they may be cutting edge in terms of South Asia only, not the whole of Asia and certainly not the world. The only real cutting edge (on a global scale) thing you mentioned was Brahmos - and even then India wanted it to have a longer operational range, Russia refused.  Once fully operational, Beidou will cover the whole globe, IRNSS will not - so it doesn't matter how much bigger China is than India. And there's no point in comparing to Beidou 1 since Beidou 2 is the newer system."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,2,Sat Jul 18 21:35:37 2015 UTC,It's also more than just number of satellites that determines capability.
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,0,Sat Jul 18 22:42:40 2015 UTC,You don't use satellites for battlefield surveillance. Otherwise why even have UAVs?
pakistan,3dqke1,MatCauthon28,3,Sat Jul 18 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"No of course not. Just clarifying that Indian satellite surveillance is robust.  Also emphasizing that since we are not in a war right now, there is no real requirement of a real time surveillance at a remote cross border location, and even if there was a need there are better drones in Indian inventory which can be deployed in a fairly short amount of time.  Plus I don't think you understand how hard it is for the Indian military to buy anything of Chinese origin. Indian military personnel are not even allowed to own Mi phones cause they are a Chinese company. Indian army telecom infrastructure recently went under a overhaul when it was realized that ta part of the equipment was sourced from Huwaie. So BSF buying Chinese drones is unimaginably remote."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,3,Sat Jul 18 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"No of course not. Just clarifying that Indian satellite surveillance is robust.   Why did you need to clarify this? US satellite surveillance is far more robust but that has nothing to with their use of UAVs. Different platforms for different needs.   Also emphasizing that since we are not in a war right now, there is no real requirement of a real time surveillance at a remote cross border location, and even if there was a need there are better drones in Indian inventory which can be deployed in a fairly short amount of time.   We literally just exchanged fire across the border just a week or so ago. For local units under fire, it might as well be war.   Plus I don't think you understand how hard it is for the Indian military to buy anything of Chinese origin. Indian military personnel are not even allowed to own Mi phones cause they are a Chinese company. Indian army telecom infrastructure recently went under a overhaul when it was realized that ta part of the equipment was sourced from Huwaie. So BSF buying Chinese drones is unimaginably remote.   Fair enough. But this could be a case of some Indian army fast track procurement buying them from commercial sources in Europe or elsewhere without realizing or caring where the original source was from. This is not exactly telecom infrastructure. It's nothing more then a tool.  And also: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/16/us-india-china-huawei-idUSKCN0PP14520150716  And at least in the IAF, Chinese p[hones aren't banned: http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/iaf-issued-advisory-4-months-back-says-no-ban-on-xiaomi-or-other-phones/"

Neither is satellite useful for real time information.   Every military including the US uses smaller tactical drones."
pakistan,3dqke1,Thelog0,2,Sat Jul 18 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"Umm, you do know it costs money to use all those assets you mentioned right?    Are you implying  a country that spends 45-50 billion $ on its military , can't afford to use its own equipment for a covert operation?   Those more expensive drones cannot cover every area.    Are you implying a shitty commercial drone with a 12 mega pixel camera in a mountain region can?    Every military including the US uses smaller tactical drones.   Yes, except Indians have their own massively superior tactical  drones  too. Which uber stomps Phantom 3 in every category. The best part of these drones are they can be easily built.   My question is, where is the proof?   For all you know it could be from the Chinese or some media or a freelancer outlet . Hell I can buy this with 2 moths salary."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,5,Sat Jul 18 17:34:52 2015 UTC,"Are you implying a country that spends 45-50 billion $ on its military , can't afford to use its own equipment for a covert operation?   India is still a developing country where it can't afford to give very one of it's border force units a $35,000+ drone like the Raven UAV. A $3,000 drone makes a whole lot more sense to any reasonable person. Here's the tactical drone that the US uses, and it's costs are inflated due to contractor costs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RMB9WMdG6g It would be incredibly smart to use a COTS drone for tactical border surveillance.   Are you implying a shitty commercial drone with a 12 mega pixel camera in a mountain region can?   It's not shitty. Drone video quality has improved considerably for commercial drones. They are now used for commercial photography and broadcast media. Nothing shitty about these drones. I don't think you even understand the reason for using tactical drones.   Yes, except Indians have their own massively superior tactical drones too. Which uber stomps Phantom 3 in every category.    You're not getting it are you. All of India's drones either need a runway or a big rail launcher to take off. A post of your BSF or army in a mountainous are will not have that space or logistics ability. Tactical drones are meant to give small units easily launchable ground intelligence of their immediate area. That's where COTS (Commercially Off The Shelf) technology has become a game changer for militaries the world over.  India can easily buy a 1,000 small drones of this type and give to it's border units. It cannot deploy that many of it's military grade drones which will need runways and rail launchers that need vehicles to transport them. India's UAV inventory for military grade UAVs is simply not big enough."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,-7,Sat Jul 18 18:37:10 2015 UTC,Makes sense for BSF units to use cheap commercial drones for tactical surveillance. Cheap and effective.
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:00:38 2015 UTC,Listen to this tactical drone at 4:13. You have no clue what tactical drones are even used for. They are not stealth spy machines. They just observe the area and pinpoint locations and troop movements through video.  https://youtu.be/8RMB9WMdG6g?t=251
pakistan,3dqke1,ultrachez,2,Sat Jul 18 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Surveillance != Spying  Both have drastically different logistics.   Also, if you hadn't noticed these drones had 1 maybe two rotors. The one Pakistan army claims it shot down has 4. That is 4 times the noise.  Please watch how the U.S. Army uses its drone for spying. One of the biggest requirements is gliding so they can shut off the engines when taking capturing data in hostile territory. A quad copter does not have this feature."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,0,Sat Jul 18 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a surveillance drone. All drones are used for surveillance and reconnaissance. That's the definition of spying on enemy positions. What else did you think they're used for?  LOL, they don't shut off the engine on the drone. It doesn't have a large enough glide ratio. It would drop like a rock. It's used for observation of enemy locations. It's relatively cheap as they don't really care if it gets shot down or just crashes. Tactical drones are meant to be largely expendable. They're also meant to be ""grunt proof"" and that's why they are cheap as you have regular soldiers operating them from their forward positions."
pakistan,3dqke1,TotallyNotObsi,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"Geez, why so angry? All drones are loud. Have you ever heard the Shadow drone that the US uses for tactical surveillance?  Here take a listen at 0:59. It's even louder in person.  https://youtu.be/NSJGS482xUQ?t=59"

pakistan,3dli4p,WorkReddit3420,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:42 2015 UTC,It is a little more complicated than that.  When it comes to energy it is important to have a mix of energy (ir-regardless of price). So it is a good idea to have super low cost nuclear and coal as a base fuel that is always on since they are (potentially) the lowest cost per unit. Then have hydro since it is only on part of the time. Then have natural gas as filling in the gaps.  Renewable like solar and wind are good also as offsetting peak needs.

pakistan,3di2or,IzmailPirzada,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:06 2015 UTC,"The drinking of blood of common animals is pretty much a standard in most special forces around the world. They're trained to be able to kill animals in the wild and use them for sustenance, but when it comes to public demonstrations they tend to show themselves killing rabbits and snakes and quickly dismembering them for visual effect. I've seen it in footage of Syrian, Saudi, Iraqi, and Russian troops. Pretty weird if you ask me but it's something they do."
pakistan,3di2or,ahyuknyuk,2,Thu Jul 16 20:50:32 2015 UTC,Drinking blood would be a bad idea if you dont have potable water. All that salt+dehydration= A bad situation.
pakistan,3di2or,IzmailPirzada,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:59 2015 UTC,"Like I said, its more of a visual show of force during parades and demonstrations. I highly doubt these guys aren't carrying actual, healthy sustenance on themselves when in the field. Besides, isn't drinking blood haram?"
pakistan,3di2or,ahyuknyuk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"They probably are but they are probably trained for survival in case they are caught in the wilderness without any food, or if they have their base besieged by an enemy for a long time and they run out of food. They are probably given some basic training on what plants, insects, reptiles and amphibians they can eat without risking poisoning themselves and how to do it.  I once saw Bear Grylls slit a deers throat and drink its blood, he said fresh blood keeps you warm.... though Man Vs Wild is a pretty full of shit show...  I doubt they have a cafeteria which exclusively serves frog legs and snake. That board said they did, but if an entire military academy was living on snakes and frogs year round I'm pretty sure the frog and snake population in the area would be finished. I wouldnt be surprised if new recruits are forced to eat this weird stuff as part of some ragging/hazing ritual.  I also doubt these guys care about haram and halal food in the greater scheme of things. They would drink blood or eat pork if it meant they could survive to complete their mission. If they cared about what was haram and halal they wouldnt have drunk blood and eaten snake as a demonstration since the only cases when non halal food can be eaten is in life or death situations, and what we saw on TV wasnt a life or death situation. Plus they probably believe that as Ghazis(Islamic war veterans) and potential Shaheeds they will be forgiven minor sins."

When he lifts his left hand with the fork to his mouth, he swiftly uses the knife with his right hand to propel the fork into his mouth, so as to technically not use his left hand. I never noticed this until a few months ago.  Dragging chairs is also a very contentious issue at my house, and so is sitting with a giant impact, regardless of how soft the sofa is.

pakistan,3dfw47,IzmailPirzada,2,Thu Jul 16 04:10:47 2015 UTC,"Boarding schools, especially the ones run by the military, were something boys in Pakistan all fantasized about back in the day. My dad was 14th Entry at Hasanabdal and left in 1972.   Since then, the private ones have remained excellent places for parents to send their kids. The public ones, however, suffer from a serious lack of funding and are usually heavily endowed by their alma mater. My dad and his friends do fundraising for Hasanabdal pretty much every year, because the government funds have dried up.  It is only part in thanks to the retired army officers who return to be administrators at government-run military boarding schools who keep the institutions in the best shape with limited resources.   These schools are also still the one avenue by which hard-working boys from less-privileged backgrounds can gain admission to Pakistan's top universities, or kickstart their military careers via PMA Kakul and make sure their families never struggle again. You can usually check the A-level and FSC results for cadet colleges on their websites; they're exemplary.  And in addition, even today, military boarding schools drill values into young men that no other public institution in Pakistan can. The folks who graduate are refined in literally every manner, and nothing can take a young man farther than having a firm set of ethics and discipline with them. They learn loyalty and friendship on levels even I have a hard time replicating, and this is coming from a teenager."

pakistan,3dfw47,WisestAirBender,6,Thu Jul 16 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"Some of these beliefs have a basis in Islam but are acted on differently based on culture.   The nail cutting thing has to do with the one who slaughters animals. He should not cut his nails on days where he slaughters. Which is why they take a day off in the week.   Immediately after Maghrib until the sun is fully set is when Jinn are most likely to out and about and bother children. This has basis in hadith. So parent's are supposed to keep their kids at home during these 15-20 minutes. I don't know about the staying awake part.  Nazar is a belief in Islam, but nothing like a taweez or amulet has anything to do with Islam. The only thing that can protect you is Du'a.  Yawning is considered to influence by jinn, hence to cover the mouth and not be loud is proper.  Laughing loudly and for long periods is considered immoral -- you are not mindful of God in these instances.  The rest of the stuff like white food can't be touched by moonlight and proper attire outside... no idea where that came from. Maybe Hinduism and British culture effects."

pakistan,3dd9rx,hugga4u,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:36:50 2015 UTC,"So here is the thing, while the comment is made with sarcasm, I think what is fair criticism is that there is still a fair degree of backwardness between what is the current law in India, and how things are in rest of the world.  India has deep scars from The Rajiv Gandhi assassination from SL Tamils. Read Page 9 here   Suryanarayan has argued for a national refugee law and cites the case of the terror threat posed by Sri Lankan Tamils to illustrate the urgent need for one.19 For instance, he states that among the accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, half a dozen were registered as refugees.20 He clearly states that “the absence of a well defined national refugee law has created a number of anomalous situations.”    and this is what refugees are eligible for   In addition, since the government makes no lawful distinction between migrants and refugees, they are often eligible for the same humanitarian services offered to refugees, often provoking local unrest. The Sri Lankan Tamil refugees receive cash doles and other essential items like rice, sugar, and kerosene at highly subsidized rates, which are not available to the local population   Now, because several of these refugees / asylum seekers stay in camps, they do not fulfill the KYC requirements of banks.   This article shows   Legal infrastructure: All rights, including property rights, exist only within a legal framework. Urban laws and their application need to be oriented towards protecting the legitimate needs of the urban poor, especially in areas related to livelihood. For instance, street hawkers need to be recognised and incorporated into the legal and architectural framework of the city. Rather than see hawkers merely as a nuisance, we should see them as part of the ecosystem of a vibrant city. What they need is transparent regulation not banishment. The current approach taken by most municipal authorities is merely leading to the proliferation of illegal hawkers and to corruption.  If these frameworks are put in place, the urban poor will themselves find ways to move up the value chain. Indeed, the slums themselves will evolve and upgrade (as is happening anyway in many of the older urban villages of Delhi).   In a US kind of fashion, India is learning how to deal with helpless by not banishing them, but including them in the broader scheme, and give them a chance for upliftment. The current policies are designed to just get them away from slaughter and get them to a life of squalor."

pakistan,3dalz0,Shaanistan,11,Tue Jul 14 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"What differentiates us from an Indian Muslim in terms of culture ?   I don't think Indian Muslims have different culture than Indian Hindus/Sikhs/Jains/Chritians/Parasis. Culture is mostly driven by region, language and common shared history. Religion does play a part, but it is less significant than those other parts.   A Tamil Muslim has more in common with a Tamil Hindu then a UP Muslim and vice versa."
pakistan,3dalz0,Meghdoot,2,Wed Jul 15 07:12:41 2015 UTC,"No no, we are much more similar to north indian muslims / Pakistani muslims than to Tamil Hindus.

We have different religions, slangs, clothings, names, cultural practices and habits than the Hindus."
pakistan,3dalz0,TheSereneSufi,3,Wed Jul 15 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"Which Tamil Muslim are you talking about? The Tamil Urdu Muslim or the actual Tamil Muslim? I've known many Tamil Muslims as well as Urdu Muslims from TN and from what I've seen Urdu Muslims are the ones that find anything at all in common with North Indian Muslims. I remember one particular Tamil Muslim friend saying this when we were searching for a bride for him ""Kerala Muslim kooda kalyanam pannikkuven...aaanaa Tamil naattu Urdu Muslim mattum maatten"". I don't have to translate that, I believe. IMHO that guy was bigoted but still, in his opinion Tamil Muslims and Urdu Muslims are very different. Near to my father's native village in Madurai there is a village with a Muslim majority and I have seen most of them taking part in temple festivals in nearby Hindu villages (although this is changing now due to the recent Arab influences brought in by the gulf-returned). On the other hand I've found Urdu Muslims to be more aloof."

pakistan,3dalz0,h___nisar,2,Wed Jul 15 13:54:44 2015 UTC,Best answer
pakistan,3dalz0,h___nisar,9,Wed Jul 15 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Well, when you guys talk about Indian Muslims, you probably think and mean the muslims from northern states - such as UP, Bihar, Delhi etc. Thats a very broad brush to paint. I hail from Southern part of the country, a small town called Bapatla in state of Andhra Pradesh. I studied for few years in Hyderabad because of my father's job and then I went on to study in one of the IIT's located in North India, Kharagpur to be specific . Thats about my background. Now, let me tell you how different I am from the rest of the muslims of my country    I didn't know Urdu. Have learnt to speak Hindi out of compulsion because of my long stay in Northern India and didn't want to be felt left out of the conversations with my friends. Today I can converse but can barely read. I had ZERO knowledge about partition, hindu-muslim divide etc. I have studied syllabus prescribed by our state and the most of the history that I remember is of the state, its culture and heritage. Such as Satavahanas , Kakatiya etc. Anyway, I was very good at studies and history /social studies is just some drudgery to get over with. It is not a profitable subject. I just noticed that our textbooks are online Culturally, I am closer to people of my region and can relate with them. I can probably relate to my Tamil brethren and also Kannadigas. There are lot of  cultural similarities , esp movies. Good movies of these states are usually translated (we call them dubbed) into each other languages. And film industry in our states are nothing to sneeze at. Each of them produce 200-300 movies a year. I can't relate to my North Indian friends - muslims or otherwise. First, there is a language barrier. Even though I can converse it woefully falls short of being able to grasp idioms, nuances of usage of the language, urban lingo etc. Also, I find them to be more aggressive, a bit rude and dominating and condescending. Take this observation of mine with a pinch of salt - entirely personal experience.   So, in summary, there is a wide diversity of Muslims in India, in cultural sense.  On an unrelated note, we also have a national curriculum NCERT and those books are also online. I am almost sure every other state text books are available online for free. Can any one of you provide me an equivalent link for textbooks in Pakistan?"

pakistan,3dalz0,h___nisar,4,Wed Jul 15 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think I can differentiate between urdu and hindi at all. And I don't think the two languages are mutually unintelligible to be called as very different languages, as far as spoken language is concerned.  I can read and speak Telugu (my mother tongue), Tamil and Kannada. Can understand Malayalam and possibly Marathi (barely). I married a Bengali and so I can speak that language."

Correct me if im wrong.  Im pretty ignorant on the different Southern Indian languages, is there alot of variance between Telegu, Tamil, Malayalam?"
pakistan,3dalz0,h___nisar,2,Wed Jul 15 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"Well, hindi or urdu play no or insignificant role in my daily life. For over last two decades, the centre of growth in India is in Southern states. You don't need to know Hindi if you get a job in these states - but knowledge of local language will help.  Here I ""draw"" the three languages   Tamil : தமிழ் Telugu : తెలుగు Malayalam : മലയാളം   They are mutually unintelligible and one have to learn it."

pakistan,3dalz0,TaazaPlaza,2,Wed Jul 15 04:14:28 2015 UTC,"They are very different. Telugu is one of the languages that has roots in Sanskrit while Tamil is a language that has an independent streak of its own. Tamil people claim it's much older than Sanskrit and I tend to believe there is lot of truth to it, considering the amount of ancient literature we have found. Malayalam seems to have heavy influence of Sanskrit and Tamil - not sure. I am no expert on this subject."

pakistan,3dalz0,h___nisar,2,Wed Jul 15 05:31:58 2015 UTC,"Okay. For me, debates over language, history are unprofitable. That is because they should be reduced to historical facts in sense - you will ultimately get to know that's how things happened.  There is no money in it :).

The idea of Pakistan itself manifested from those Indian Muslims, was fought for by them, and initially totally ruled by them. All for a region to which they were foreign, the people of which were rather apathetic to being apart of Pakistan or not.   The native people of the region weren't particularly for/against Pakistan except for the fact it would be ruled by Muslims. The reason being they were already majority muslim and throughout history no matter who ruled their lands; Dehli, Kabul, Iran, or Britain -- they were always the fringe of each empire and effectively ruled themselves.   This is why the hypernationalism of Indians doesn't exist in Pakistan. Pakistanis don't see the sub-contitnent as one nation as Indians do, nor to do they see it as 2 nations as most muhajir Pakistanis or the elite of Pakistan do -- they see it like Europeans see Europe -- a vast geography of many nations with cultural overlaps.   This is why all regions of Pakistan are inherently autonomous, the federal government is weak, and why the army is the only thing that keeps things in line.   Pakistaniyat to the average Pakistani is unified belief that we are not one and that each deserves respect.  The most hypernationalistic Pakistanis are those who came from Indian punjab or UP urdu-speakers. And naturally so, without the strong identity of Pakistani = not-India then who are they? Just people from Lucknow, Dehli, Ludhiana and Jalhandar. They need the identity more than anyone else. Everyone else can call themselves Pashtoon, Baluch, Sindhi, Punjabi, Multani, Hunzai..etc. They don't have to call themselves Pakistani.   What I am saying is not something revolutionary. Everyone here knows it.... Mein Karachi sy hoon = Hindustani. If that wasn't the case we wouldn't be calling them Muhajir after 70 years."
pakistan,3dalz0,the_brown_stockton,3,Thu Jul 16 07:41:53 2015 UTC,"Can't disagree with you there, since Im an ""urdu speaker"", I have no real ethnicity and is what probably makes me a bit more nationalistic(rightly or wrongly)than other Pakistanis.   So you say an Indian Muslim and a Pakistani are one and the same culturally, do you think anything can differentiate them now after 60 odd years?"
pakistan,3dalz0,RoastedCashew,2,Thu Jul 16 05:52:00 2015 UTC,"You do have an ethnicity. Maybe you are a Mughal, maybe a Bihari, Haryanvi etc, etc. Most Muslims are the same thing as the people around them. Urdu-speaking Muslims and Hindi-speaking Hindus are the natives of Northern India -- so essentially they call themselves Hindustani. However, UP Muslims of all the Muslims of South Asia are the most likely to be descended from elsewhere, as the rulers of Dehli were always from Central Asia. A great number of Muhajir are Pashtun but assimilated into Mughlai culture. So it's hard to generalize.   Pakistani isn't an ethnicity, it's a nationality. However, so many people equate Pakistaniyat to culture and ethnicity. This goes especially true of the people of Karachi who equate Pakistaniyat to the modern incarnation of the Mughal Empire. This is faulty because Dehli only directly ruled Northern India (Agra, Dehli etc.) and Lahore for most of history and is represented culturally by mostly Uttar Pardesh. So the guy in Hyderabad, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta isn't feeling much of a connection with this idea. In fact, Pakistan is more of a reincarnation of the Durrani Empire than the Mughals.  Northern Punjab readily adapted to Urdu because of Lahore being very much apart of the Dehli's rule for most of history. That's is the most simple answer as to why Punjabis are more likely to speak Urdu than every other group.   The Muslims of Hyderabad and UP/Bihar are culturally similar. And it's their descendants in Karachi who brought their culture to what is now Pakistan. Biryani was not so famous, nor was a Sherwani until the arrival of Muhajirs. The ideals of what the high-class culture should be also comes from Muhajirs. This all stems from the fact that at partition almost all the natives of Pakistan were uneducated. There was one university and one medical school. The majority didn't live in cities. Even the cities population levels were considered a town in Bahrat. Those Muslim who came from India were urbanized and educated, and this is why Urdu became a big deal and why the Mughal culture entered all facets of life, in terms of food, clothes, national narrative, etc. So to say a Muhajir has no sense of belonging in Pakistan is totally wrong. Muhajirs are very much the reason Pakistan is the way it is today. However, at the same time they are the most in denial of their ancestry and roots and the most likely to propagate the fantasy of Persian, Turkish, Arab roots (Not that some aren't...but most certainly ALL can't be). Also, the entire notion that everyone who is Muslim became Muslim in the 7th century with Muhammad bin Qasim's arrival or came with him. (That is a lengthy conversation, the spread of Islam, for another post if you are interested) What is the shame in being from Lucknow? Nothing. If all the Mujahirs that settled in Sindh spoke Sindhi like all the Muhajirs of Punjab did by speaking Punjabi, no one would consider you anything else -- today you would be Sindhi. Even all the Pashtun rulers of Multan speak Saraiki today. Everyone in the history of the region adapted to the language of where they settled in daily public life (at home people may continue to speak mother tongues) except the Indian Muslims who settled in Karachi. There is a disproportionate amount of power in the 7%. So is it surprise that Sindhis have issues? In fact, every separatist movement in the country is because of this. No one can read/write their native language. If Bangladesh was still apart of Pakistan, today no one would read/write Bengali. Until 1971 they were apart of Pakistaniyat -- ironically, no one here even thought about that.   So in that way the Muslims who came from India are like the Muslims of India today. In Hyderabad, Urdu rules even though they are in a Telugu state. But all Muslims share similarities no matter where they are from. So a Peshawari is going to find more in common with the UP Muslim than the UP Hindu. So those commonalities are not exclusive to just the Muhajir.   On the other hand, Karachi is its own unique culture now too, borrowing from the native cultures as well. So it has diverged. If you can tell in Indian Punjabi from a Paki Punjabi then you can tell the difference between the Urdu-speakers too. I mean I can tell a Hyderabadi a mile away. At the same time I can tell who is a Hariyanvi in Paki Punjab, or the guy from Ludhiana. Pakistan's standard of Urdu is also based on Karachi -- not Lucknow -- and they are not the same. So even in speech you will hear the difference. So after 60 years there are distinctions as well.  However, the best way to answer your question is simply to ask: If you were in Dehli today, would you be seen as foreign? No. ...but the guy from Quetta definitely would be.   If Pakistaniyat is supposed to be not-Bahratiyat, then Pakistan would have embraced everything non-Indian that is native to Pakistan... we'd be speaking Farsi as the national language, every region would teach in their own language, probably everyone would know Punjabi or Pashto as a 2nd language, and most likely Afghanistan would be a part of the country (Almost happened in the 1950s).  tl;dr: Same ethnically (usually, there are exceptions); slightly different culturally; vastly different in terms of self-identity."

I'm super curious and encouraging of most South Asian to do so. It will answer lots of questions.  EDIT: I read the article. So are you Zaidi? Very few Zaidis in the subcontinent.

pakistan,3dalz0,TaazaPlaza,2,Thu Jul 16 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"Zaidis were all over at one point, however, today they only exist in great numbers in Yemen. I assume you are the same as them if you believe in 5 imams?   Historically, Zaidis (5'ers -- end at Zain-ul-Abidin) represented the majority of Shias (they are the most close to Sunnis in terms of beliefs and fiqh), then the Ismailis (After Jaffar As-Sadiq they take Ismail as the Imam and go from there) pushed them to the sidelines; ie. the Fatemid Caliphate of Egypt. They lost prominence when Ayyubids of Salahudin took Egypt; then the Qarmati Ismailis (7'ers who end at Ismail) which took Mecca, Medina, most of East Arabia and Multan from the Abbasis and even stole the black rock and ransomed it. They lost the Arab lands and last power was in Multan -- the Ghaznavids invade everything from Kabul to Multan to root them out (this is the period most of Pakistan and Afghanistan is introduced to Islam) and succeed.. they die out. Then whats left of the mainstream Ismailis splintered into the Nizari (Aga Khanis), Dawoodi (Bohra), Mustali depending on the Imam they chose. Dawoodis were also mostly based out of Yemen. While all this is going on you have the 12ers who were minor players in the Muslim world taking Musa al-Kadm as the 7th Imam instead of Ismail. They rise to prominence in the 1500s with the Safavid dynasty in Iran which were a sufi order that converted to 12'ers and forced conversions of largely Sunni Iran. Since that time they are the major Shia group in the world. The minorities existing today are the Druze in Lebanon/Syria/Iraq; the Nizari Ismailis (Aga Khanis), majority in Northern Pakistan, and some large South Asian cities, and East Africa; Dawood Bohra mostly in Gujurat and Karachi; and Zaidis, mostly exclusive to Northern Yemen.  Besides them you have a group called Ibadis/Zikris -- they are not Sunni or Shia and are the majority of Oman. They are the direct decedents of what Sunnis call the Khawarij.  They are unique in that they sided with Ali and then turned against him because he made a truce, saying that, by doing so he had forsaken God's commands to uphold the sanctity of the Caliph. So they fought both sides and once held much of East and Southern Arabia. Now they are found only in Oman and are the majority. They reject almost all hadith from Sunnis or Shias and are thus are often referred to as ""Quran-only"" Muslims.    A little flowchart for you."
pakistan,3dalz0,Cicerotulli,2,Thu Jul 16 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"Ok so I just read up on some ish. Turns out you are not Zaidi in the religious sense. You are a Zaidi in the familial sense; you claim Syed lineage through the line of Zaid-ul-Abidin's decedents who didn't return to Hejaz, settled in Iraq, and subsequently migrated east. You are most likely Ithna‘ ashariyyah (12'er)?"

Being an Indian, what I identify with Indian-ness is the region called India. I am a Sanadhya Brahmin and we have our own culture but I am Indian in the sense that I belong to just one of the various conglomerates of this vast region. So why can't Pakistanis identify themselves on that basis ? I am asking this because the top comment is about Urdu. Sure the concept of Pakistan is quite new but again, it is a group of various Muslim majority regions (since that was the reason for partition) situated on the western part of Indian subcontinent bordering the Iranian plateau."

It differs heavily from person to person dependent on where they've lived, their own personal background, and the friends they keep.  There was a glut of diversity in my high-school, it was mainly an international school with diaspora kids who held dual citizenship (the Third Culture crowd). I personally knew two Indian Muslims, one from Chennai/Bangalore and the other from the Urdu fantasy-land of Hyderabad.  I'm half-Punjabi and half-Kashmiri myself, and to be very honest with you, those two guys I could relate to the most alongside the Pakistanis I knew. We ate virtually the same things, our lingua franca of Urdu was the same, our parents all dressed the same and watched the same South Asian content at home, and on cultural showcase days we wore the same things.  If anything, if I hadn't known they were Indian I would've cognitively classified them as Pakistani since I'm one myself.  So what makes us exactly Pakistani as opposed to Muslims of Indian origin? The fact that we were either born in Pakistan or our ancestors moved during partition, that's pretty much it in my eyes."

Whenever India played Pakistan there used to be so much banter infused with jokes about Siachen/Kargil that it would become a roast session of unparalleled proportions.  As for outspokenness, I get what you're trying to say. I'm a pretty reserved person, and with friends I can get a bit rowdy, but that's not because of cultural tendencies and it usually takes place in English.  My folks always made sure I knew the native languages formally. However, the moment I switch from English to Urdu/Punjabi in a setting with no adults (usually for the purposes of humour), I can feel my control over language slipping, and the paindu begins to creep in with the stretched vowels and the haaain. It's the kind of speech our mothers would call ""cheapo.""   The Hyderabadi guy would in no way ever have that jazba mode initiated because those guys get heavily drilled in proper Urdu, and the Chennai/Bangalore guy would just never have that in him since those in the south of India are generally timid, no-nonsense folks."

So what makes us exactly Pakistani as opposed to Muslims of Indian origin? The fact that we were either born in Pakistan or our ancestors moved during partition, that's pretty much it in my eyes.   Haha, this is quite interesting. I had a Pakistani friend who was from Lahore in my grad school. There were only 3-4 other Pakistan origin students, and a couple of them were from very rich (and may be even political, idk) families, and the other two had spent a lot of time in Europe, and were fairly ""foreign"" in their outlook.   So this guy used to live with other Indians (including one Indian Muslim), used to hang out with a bunch of us all the time, cooked with us, watched cricket with us, did literally everything with us. Mind you there were a fair number of students from middle east, Iran, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh. Other people just categorized this Pakistani as an Indian. After the first few months, I don't think even he resisted it too much, after he struggled to explain how he was a Pakistani and how he was different than an Indian.  Pakistan (at least in my mind) is a Middle East like governance structure imposed on Indian Muslims. Pakistan (in a bid to be clear about its raison detre) has sought to remove multi polarity (which pretty much is a signature of India - I am this, and I am that) from it, whether it is language, culture or whatever. Bangladesh, on the other hand is far more uniform, and far less in denial about the fact that they are practically Bengali Indians just separated with a man made line.  Pakistan feels that it would lose its identity if it absorbs diversity, and it refuses to take inspiration from India which has absorbed mind boggling amount of diversity while staying Indian. We started at ~15 states, went to this when I was in school, and are now at this. We have sought to create new administrative units, and have given more power to state. Even the Prime Minister Baby blood drinking devil himself has been pushing for more administrative power to the states, while pushing for a market level integration of the country. This is what NEEDS to happen in any large nation for success.   Until Punjab holds the de facto hegemony over Pakistan, this structure would not be stable.   IMHO."

Specific issues with specific answers.  If the reporter in question had a full show dedicated to a discussion that lasted at least an hour(and even that wouldnt be long enough). Because the answer to the question, ""How can we bring prosperity to Pakistan"" has a simple answer, ""Fix the problems in Pakistan""  And we all know what the problems with Pakistan are. Illiteracy, energy shortages, corruption, nepotism, law and order problems, religious extremism and terrorism.  Its the solutions to these problems that have complicated answers that need long discussions to be justified and proven correct.  So the first possibility I see is that he was expecting a coherent answer from the assembly members. Which makes him an incompetent journalist. The second possibility I see is that he wanted to have a full blown discussion with people by accosting them outside the Punjab Assembly and asking them vague questions with complicated answers, which AGAIN makes him an incompetent journalist.

In recent years certain laws,rules and social mindsets that have been enacted to protect women have inadvertently only been based on the idea that women are in fact the weaker and purer sex AND that men are all potential sex offenders. As a kid growing up in Pakistan my friends and I often faced discrimination when we wanted to go to a park to play cricket or football. At most park's we were told that 'this is park is for ladies and families only and we couldn't enter if we weren't accompanied by women'  In modern society it is perfectly acceptable for a mother to bathe her children but if a father does it, its 'creepy'. In fact many people would think its more acceptable for a maid who the child hardly knows the child to bathe him/her rather than the father.  I advise everyone here to watch the Danish film, 'The Hunt'. It's about paedophile hysteria and it deals with this bias very well.

pakistan,3d7y9h,greenvox,7,Wed Jul 15 09:25:42 2015 UTC,"It is interesting how our society demonizes men, and then grooms them to fit the template. I was reading a fatwa  given by Sheikh Qaradawi of Egypt concerning females leading prayers. While Muhammad allowed a woman from Yemen to lead her tribe in prayers, Sheikh Qaradawi opined that as long as a woman is attracting lustful glances from men behind her, she can not lead them in prayers. Thus, the sheikh was of the opinion that praying men would be lustful towards a woman in an abaya, leading them in prayer. To say that this is humiliating and demeaning would be an understatement. This would in fact make Masjid al-Haram a hotbed of lust since men and women stand together in that Masjid.   The problem is that this opinion is not just shared by ulema, but also by millions of fathers, mothers, brothers, relatives and neighbors in our society and it is literally akin to thinking of all men as pedophiles and gropers. This is also directly related to segregated education which raises children to disassociate with, and dehumanize the opposite gender.  Anyways, I digress."

Statistically women spend more money at shops and are largely in charge of shopping for their children, which is why the malls are making it more accommodating for them as opposed to the men.

pakistan,3d950d,KingJamesX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"Bully Kuttas are definitely not like Labs. They are very territorial, with strong prey drive. They are bred in Pakistani villages mainly as fighting dogs and to guard crops from thieves and wild animals. Most large dog breeds are lazy and dont want much exercise. An hour of walk a day is enough for them. I havent ever had a BK before specifically, so I cant say. Eastern dog breeds dont have breed standards like western breeds either. So dogs can vary a lot. For example here is what according to my research I understand to be a 'Sindhi BK'  http://www.americanbullykutta.com/images/1010-bully-kutta-4.jpg very wrinkly face, predominantly white, and very short hair. So short in fact that they sometimes look like they are a light shade of pink because you can see the skin(though maybe all the dogs in pictures I have seen were suffering from mange)  This is what I understand to be a Punjabi BK http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/images/classifieds/2014/01/03/520647/large/bully-kutta-x-american-bulldog-puppies-52c8760d5a48d.jpg http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/images/classifieds/2014/01/03/520647/large/bully-kutta-x-american-bulldog-puppies-52c8760d5a48d.jpg  As you can see the skin is tighter, and eyes are larger. Muscle tone is more visible.  Most undesirable aggression in dogs stems from lack of exercise. It is an expression of pent up energy. So if you cant give the dog the physical and mental stimulation it needs I would advice against getting a dog which has high prey drive and territorial instincts. Socialization with humans is very important. If you think he might be coming into contact with other dogs, dog socialization is also very important.  Labs tau sub kay buddies hotay hain :) BK's are a different story.  I basically want a big dog and western large breeds dont do well in Pakistani weather.  I also adopted a friends Afghan Kuchi dog when she was 3 years old(friend and his family moved to UK). Sadly she got arthritis when she was 9 and had to be put down. But 9 is still an ok age for a large breed. AK's also share many temperament traits with BK's so I think I'm prepared.  BK's because of their size will also be expensive to keep because large dog=more food and more expensive vet bills."

But (and i know their owners will take offense to this) there are certain breeds that i just wouldn't trust in any case with younger children and small dogs like rottweilers, pit-bulls, Alsatian and the majestic great Danes. So is BK like one of those? Or he's like St. Bernard (huge but innocent as shit)?   But 9 is still an ok age for a large breed.    Definitely. St.Bernard only live upto 9.    BK's because of their size will also be expensive to keep because large dog=more food and more expensive vet bills.   This is what i am most worried about. I will look into the costs for this breed"

When I asked locals about it they said some of this was done by the Taliban, and that the Taliban had gone into business with the KPK timber mafia. But mostly it was done by locals who had no other source of fuel.  So I hope IK has a plan to provide people who live in or nearby KPK's forested areas with some cheap alternative fuel because without that planting more trees will be an incomplete solution.  Planting more trees is still a good idea and a commendable step. I'm just saying its not enough."

In a media briefing here at WAPDA House, he said the government had also stretched 1500km-long new transmission lines besides setting up of new and upgrading some of the existing grid stations in the country. He added that this would only help overcome low-voltage problem but also end load-shedding by end of 2017.   When paying the line man or just hooking up to the grid with a kunda is the norm, why do you think we will have good transmission structure?    He added that Sindh government's Rs 69 billion recovery was receivable, HESCO (Hyderabad) and SEPCO (Sukkur) Rs 70 billion, PESCO (Peshawar) Rs 90 billion, QESCO (Quetta) Rs 148 billion, AJK Rs 48 billion and FATA Rs 49 billion. Abid Sher said electricity worth billions of rupees was being stolen across Pakistan, asserting that PESCO's 600 feeders are running in loss and its 110 feeders are making up 85 percent losses, similarly there were law and order issues in QESCO domain, while all the four distribution companies (DISCOs) in Punjab (Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala and Multan) and Islamabad's (IESCO) accumulative losses remained at only 14 percent.

After all, the problem isnt producing power. Its the deficit which results in power stations remaining unpaid for their production.  The first thing to do would be to replace the parts of the grid that need replacing. Transformers, wiring, etc. All these things are very old, very badly maintained and often cheaper goods/materials that corrupt bureaucrats used to replace quality goods/material.  The second and no less important problem is corruption and nepotism in the bureaucracy in charge of the Pakistans electricity grid. How this is to be done... no idea.  The third is to take on electricity theft and unpaid bills.

Another place would be a truck drivers' restaurant and ask a waiter or wait to smell it. This being Ramzan however makes your chances a lot less likely. The guy suggesting speaking to cops is also on the right track, though they are a lot trickier to deal with unless you have a connect. in lahore, going to shah jamal on a thursday will guarantee some hash.   pro tip: refer to it as ""dawaii"" always."

pakistan,3d48l3,ahyuknyuk,3,Mon Jul 13 13:04:57 2015 UTC,"karachikhatmal is an ok idea. Go to Lahores Shahjamal on any Thursday night after Ramzan has ended, people will be smoking hash and consuming bhang openly. Another suggestion I could make for you is to go to Lahores Lawrence Gardens. There are a lot of guys with Paaparr(fried crispy bread thingy) stalls over there. Ask them for 'doosra wala paaparr' it will be a paaparr prepared with bhang. Its VERY cheap, and will give you a strong high for a long time. Effect is similar to pot brownies.  Though I dont smoke hash regularly anymore, I have noticed that for the past one year the quality of hash has really gone down. I suspect its because of the military operation in Tirah valley. Thats where 90% of the Pakistani hash comes from."
pakistan,3d48l3,ahyuknyuk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:26:58 2015 UTC,awesome...thanks for the help.  do you have any contact numbers for me to call maybe in sialkot or lahore that could provide hash?

pakistan,3d48l3,karachikhatmal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:33:28 2015 UTC,If you know of someone that could deliver hash from lahore to sialkot I could pay them the price of the hash plus an additional 2 to 3 thousand delivery fee.

Maybe I can get a number or something for you. The problem is that since I dont have a personal relationship with a dealer anymore it will be hard for me to convince anyone to make a trip on my recommendation. One guy who I used to buy regularly from for two whole years makes a regular trip from Lahore to Peshawar and back every 3 or 4 weeks but thats probably a supply run, I doubt he'll go to Sialkot.  I doubt I'll be able to help you if you cant come to Lahore if I can help you at all. Give me a couple of days and I'll see what I can do for you."

Even double the cost. Perhaps you or your dealer know of a local dealer in sialkot that I could contact and pick up from. I am in pakistan till August so I am willing to wait as well. Any type of help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks again for the help. I will continue my search here in the meantime and let you know if I have any luck.
pakistan,3d48l3,ahyuknyuk,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"haha thanks buddy. Mazaar = shrine. Its definitely not a masjid though can often include one. Unless you meant some weird black magic satanist type shit, grave worshippers is a derogatory term, and something that has evolved due to the influence of more 'modernist' and literalist interpretations. However, in this context thats the info you need - that is where to go and find a malang. You have to be a bit street smart and don't follow anyone inside a building or a dead end.    As for a tulla, I would advise going to a low ranking officer and starting up a convo about the weather or whatever and take it from there. In any situation with cops, it is best to empathise with their jobs, and (fairly so) congratulate them on their bravery during a time of terrorism. Once they've opened up, talk about the sins you are looking to indulge in, and always speak in sentences ambiguous enough that they allow you to backtrack in case anyone gets offended. I would avoid mentioning that you are here from abroad since that would only increase the chances of wanting to take advantage of you. Not knowing fluent Punjabi can be a curse but blame that on being from a city like Lahore or Karachi.   In all situations, remember that getting caught with a couple of joints is no big deal. Therefore, no one needs to get too secret to give it, and you don't have to pay too much or perform sexual favours etc. A smoker would probably just turn to the side and pass over the joint if he has one. Anyone asking you to follow them to a shady place has worse plans in mind. And any cop threatening to extract a large bribe or massive jail time is also lying. Don't freak out and deal with it.   Best of luck!"

Qila, citadel, a garrison community peopled by soldiers and civilians alike who are prepared to launch an armed defense against aggressors.   Sadly people who peddle this ideology don't realize that they aren't really protecting themselves from anything but rather are the ones stuck inside this fortress. Like Machiavelli said, ""Fortresses are useful or not according to circumstance; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone”  Instead of championing an open door policy these idiots want to uphold the echo-chamber of indoctrination that has gotten us into this horrible mess of violence and barbarianism.

There are plenty of clerics in every sect that that denounce every other sect as heretical.  Furthermore democracy in Pakistan has always been a sham. Accountability and rule of law is the base of democracy. Without it there is no real democracy.  And how can you prove that Islam will provide this Utopia you promise? How will Islam bring about accountability and rule of law in this country? And if violence is a 'western tool' how will you bring about this islamic state? Will you go to the rich old men who own this country and ask them politely?  Change comes very slowly. Look at the circumstances of the creation of this country.

You think infant girls weren't raped during the Rape of Nanking? What about female genital mutilations in Egypt? Or acid throwing in Pakistan? Or the Beslan  school massacre in Russia? Or the atrocities of Mahmud of Ghazni? What about the violence in China during its revolution? What about the Mongols?  These are not western atrocities these are human atrocities because it's in our nature to be violent when given the right trigger for it. If you argued that the west was hypocritical about its attitude towards violence then I wouldn't be arguing with you.  You on the other hand are claiming violence is a western tool which implies that it is a western tool exclusively.

It is more to do with developing a mind-set for education than education itself that the government has failed at."

pakistan,3cxo2b,the_brown_stockton,3,Sun Jul 12 08:17:20 2015 UTC,"Theres plenty of blame to go around for Balochistan. The army and the civilian governments have done stuff in Balochistan that has fucked things up but lets stop blaming Punjab for everything.  The Baloch waderas make enough money from taxing their people to build fortresses, private jails, private militias and to educate their own sons in Lahores Aitchison college. They couldnt build a few schools?  Punjab may vote for that idiot Nawaz Sharif every election but at least that idiot builds roads and bridges for his people(even if the materials for these construction projects come from his own mills and factories)  What do the Waderas do for Balochistan? What does the PPP do for interior Sindh? What does the MQM do for Karachi?  The people in this country keep following the same leaders and then blame Punjabis instead of their own leaders. Its ridiculous."
pakistan,3cxo2b,ahyuknyuk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:44:27 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is Balochistan has been and is exploited for the sake of punjabis and if you can't see that you are naive and/or delusional. Sure, the waderas are a huge problem, they're a problem in interior sindh as well, but they're not the main problem. Karachi is a whole different story. Karachis problems lie almost 100% at the fault of MQM no ones denying that. And PPP is corrupt as hell too but Nawaz isn't really much better"
pakistan,3cxo2b,the_brown_stockton,3,Sun Jul 12 08:48:48 2015 UTC,"A large percentage of problems in Pakistan stem from waderas and landlords who rule over their communities with an iron fist and keep them poor and illiterate so that they remain dependent on the waderas and landlords. Our civilian government caters to them because a large percentage of our political class comes from this background and because the common rural man votes for whoever the wadera or landlord tells them too. This is why our civilian governments are so ineffective. Because they have an interest in keeping things how they are.  And it is the ineffectiveness of the civilian government that has created a misplaced sense of duty in the army to march in wherever and whenever they feel like and start running things their own way.  Just because the generals are at the top of the foodchain doesnt mean they are the root of the problem. Its the landlords and the waderas. And I dont see how the Baloch landlords would be any different. Why would they want development, education and healthcare in Balochistan? Why would they allow it? It only weakens their position. And you think if we started paying Balochistan extra for its natural gas the common Baloch would see a single rupee of that money? WRONG. It will all go to the waderas. Every single rupee. And the Waderas will keep blaming the Punjabis, and the insurgents in Balochistan will keep blaming the Punjabis and the waderas will keep getting fatter and fatter."
pakistan,3cxo2b,ahyuknyuk,0,Sun Jul 12 10:23:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you mostly, but none of that excuses extrajudicial killings and such carried out by Pak gov in Balochistan. Although I disagree with the movement even as a Baloch, the independence movement exists for a reason"
pakistan,3cxo2b,the_brown_stockton,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the extrajudicial killings either. Unlike the militants in FATA who had expanded their networks into Punjab and Karachi, the Baloch militant network remains limited to Balochistan. Which IMO makes a slower steadier approach in Balochistan viable.  But I don't sympathise with the leaders of the Baloch independence movement at all, an independent Balochistan is impossible, firstly the Baloch are a racial minority in Balochistan itself as their are more Pashtuns than Baloch. Secondly, the historical homeland of the Baloch is divided in two between Pakistan and Iran. Any dissent against Iran by the Irani Baloch is dealt with the same way Pakistan deals with them. The leaders of this movement cant be so idealistic that they don't realize this so they are just mercenaries exploiting Baloch grievances for there own gain.  Even if the Pakistan Army tones down its violent acts in Balochistam it still can't just stand idle and watch as a group of insurgents try to break away from the country. If the Baloch want peace in their homeland they have to turn away from their Waderas and insurgents."
pakistan,3cxo2b,ahyuknyuk,3,Sun Jul 12 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"blame   Used to see Raisani drive in Islamabad in a Dubai registered Range Rover. If he actually cared about the Baloch, he would have spent less on a car, would have actually resided in Balochistan, and used his money to help his people, probably even spend less on alcohol so that he would he mentally sound.  There are other Baloch people who have I have seen talk shit about the army while they reside in the poshest sectors of Islamabad, go abroad regularly. Drive real nice cars. That the governments fault too right?"
pakistan,3cxo2b,sak_14,3,Sun Jul 12 11:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yup. This entire ""Evil Punjabis drinking the blood of Pakistan"" comes from the fact that Punjab is the most developed whereas the rest of the country remains underdeveloped. The fact of the matter is that the largest contributor to our small economy is agriculture. And a very large percent(probably over 90%) of arable land is in Punjab. Hence Punjab is wealthier than the other provinces.   And then there is the PMLN. I'm no fan of the PMLN but they do put effort into infrastructure. They are corrupt and politically inept but at least Punjabis get SOMETHING out of voting for the PMLN. The PMLN government probably embezzle large amounts of cash in building them, but at the end of the day, we still have new roads and bridges. Its not perfect but its something.(They also have stupid schemes like Shahbaz Sharifs stupid laptop idea and sasti roti idea)  The PPP on the other hand focuses all its efforts into useless welfare programs that gives small amounts of money to the communities that vote for them on a monthly bases. Even this is only how the PPP advertises these projects. The corruption in the PPP usually results in the officials embezzling the money they were supposed to distribute resulting in very poor, very large families receiving a fraction of the money they were supposed to receive or non at all. And even if they received the full amount... so what? It does nothing to bring the common rural man out of his condition and instead just keeps him reliant on charity. The rest of the PPP's efforts remain focused towards rhetoric about the sacrifices they have made. Z.A Bhuttos Shahadat, Benazirs Shahadat, Bilawals wet panties and god knows what else.  KPK and the Pashtun people are a lot smarter than the rest of the country because if they are unsatisfied with the current government they will not vote for them again. They have tried JI, ANP and PTI. We'll see who they try next time. Unfortunately because of the Afghan war, War on Terror and military adventurism in the region KPK has suffered a lot.   The Baloch rebels have made Balochistan so dangerous that any government projects remain impossible. So despite the Pakistan armies previous and ongoing sins in Balochistan, their presence in the province remains essential to keeping things under control. Meanwhile the Baloch Waderas couldnt give less of a shit. They have enough money for luxury SUV's, trips abroad, educating their dumbass kids who couldnt get scholarships or financial aid if you glued a textbook to their heads in foreign universities, private fortresses and militias and whatnot but have never thought of building a school or a hospital."

Bol; a commentary on patriarchy and much more. Jinnah; not exactly Pakistani, but it has Christopher Lee. Dukhtar; female empowerment tale.   I'd also recommend Waar, but purely for its action. Not really a standout film otherwise. There's another one called O21 similar to it, but I haven't seen it.  Also you might notice I'm leaving out older films.

Here's a crude map that should be of some help.  There's a bazaar of tiny retailers you can try out, in terms of purchasing products, the one I've found to be the most reliable is called (wait for it), ""The Computer Shop,"" and can be reached at: 3-583-3156.  As a word of warning, the owner there does not negotiate at all (regardless the size of your purchase), so be prepared for that (I do get frustrated at that at times).  However from my experience, he does offer the lowest prices.   Of course, feel free to explore and try out different retailers; I'm just suggesting someone via the benefit of my personal experience.  As a caveat, I ahven't had much repair work done, so I can't comment on his efficiency in that arena.  Also I don't know if he'll do house calls (but you can try calling him and see what happens).   Anyway, this is a starting point.  Perhaps there are better retailers, better places to go to, I don't know.  But this is at least to give you something.    Good luck.

The second type is typically built by the lowest bidder so it can have issues and problems such as roofs that leak in the rain, cheap paint that starts peeling when there is the slightest humidity, bad plumbing, bad wiring etc.  An old house could or couldnt have these issues. But as far as my understanding of real estate goes its cheaper than the house someone else built for the sole purpose of selling. You will basically be paying the price of the land on which it was built.  Building your own house is a very long difficult procedure even if you are living in the country. Not only would you need to find a reliable property agent to find you a decent plot of land for a reasonable price, you need someone to make sure that the people involved in its construction arent stealing the materials you gave them and replacing them with cheaper materials. You also need to keep an eye on them to make sure they are following your instructions exactly otherwise your new house may have some surprising deviations from the map and plans you gave them.  If you are looking for a city for retirement I would say Lahore and Islamabad are better. There is no point in living in the largest metropolis of the country which is riddled with crime and security problems if you dont plan on taking advantage of the job opportunities a metropolis provides. Though this also depends on where you have family and friends.

Otherwise, what happens is a land-grabbing mafia manages to dole out heavy bribes to the officials in charge of property records, and get houses put on their name as opposed to the original owners. They either squat there or sell the house for profit.  In places like Karachi, my uncle's house was randomly taken over by the MQM via force when he wasn't in the country. It is a very real possibility and many middle-class families in Pakistan who've worked years to save for their plots have their lives ruined by this kind of activity.  Either place an armed security guard at your potential residence, or keep a chowkidaar that you trust with the utmost of your heart.   Inept caretakers will let the landscape and general condition of the house to go to shit, while a trustworthy one will get the grass trimmed, walls painted when they're peeling, and will get mechanics and electricians to fix things in your absence while keeping the house tidy.

pakistan,3cwng2,dmz,5,Sat Jul 11 12:22:58 2015 UTC,If you're in Pakistan get a nihari Masala from Shan or National Foods.  Get a beef shank. If you are skilled at cutting meat then cut it yourself or get the shank meat and bone seperately. Boil the bone and get plenty of stock out of the bone. The longer you boil it the thicker the stock will be and the better it will taste.  Then just follow the instructions on the back of the Masala box. If you want the nihari to be thicker then you should add some flour.  I don't know how to cook nihari... I'v just observed my mother and grandmother cooking it plenty of times. So yeah this is pretty anecdotal.  Edit: https://www.khanapakana.com/recipe/af2617a6-d7b2-46df-a808-91c77886f1db/beef-nihari  Or there's this.  If you make or eat chicken nihari then it's blasphemy. I will find you. I will kill you.

My favourite place to get nihari if its not home made is waris nihari(I live in lahore) Lahores most famous and commercial nihari chain is Muhammadi. Which sucks, the nihari has too much garam Masala and the meat is tough and stringy. Don't eat Muhammadi.  I hear Karachi nihari is better though. Which makes sense because its a Delhi dish. I haven't been to Karachi in years... but next time I go I will check out the nihari."

A Sharif cousin, however, went to court and got a stay order which remained in force all these years.

pakistan,3critv,mase456,16,Fri Jul 10 04:52:10 2015 UTC,"We were treating the Bengolis pretty horribly. I think a split was inevitable. There's an inherent racism that plagues Western Pakistanis about the Bangladeshi people till this very day. So, I don't think the union would have remained unless there were some drastic changes made.   Zia wouldn't have been a problem. Sure, there might have been another Islamization movement, because the Saudis were going to push it regardless, but it might have come in a different form.   Economically, I think Pakistan stood to lose a lot. There was this myth (perhaps it's a myth, but anecdote might be more correct) about an East Pakistani official coming to West Pakistan for the opening of Islamabad in 1960. He remarked ""These roads smell of jute."", which was a jab at how money gotten from the export of Bengoli jute was used for useless development projects in West Pakistan while the East suffered. Further down the road, Bangladesh still exports around thrice as much as we do, largely due to their proficient garment production sector. They don't grow a bale of cotton and still out compete us! Had we been together, we would have ruled the industry.   And yes, we do owe them an apology. Sadly, that's not going to happen."
pakistan,3critv,fumblebuck,8,Fri Jul 10 08:36:37 2015 UTC,"You are trying to look at the implications but the horizon of your investigation is very limited. Even if Mujib had been allowed to form his government, would East Pakistan have remained content with its relationship with West Pakistan? I don't think so.  If you go back a couple of decades from 71 to right before partition, calls for independent Bengal were being made by the Bengals but were ignored by the trifecta of British, ML, and Congress. Bengal leaders tried unsuccessfully (like Suhrawardy, Bose et al) to revive populous politics in Bengal but were squashed by ML/Congress on a political level.   So the idea of independence of Bengal was not new. In fact, the role of popular politics in Bengal could be traced to early 1800's. Bengalis were the most politically conscious group in British India (was this due to a result of being the first ones exposed to colonialism?) and the list of Bengaliu leaders who sought to advocate for a freedom from imperialist domination and/or tried to force their groups to learn the 'modern British' ways is long and impressive.   It is because of this existing, well-developed political consciousness that I think the independence of Bengal would have been inevitable regardless of what West Pakistan did or not do. Yes, I agree that our policies and attitude towards them did not help but I don't think it was the sole factor in them getting independence but it may have certainly catalyzed the process significantly. Also, lol at re-union :P   TL;DR - there's plenty of academic discussion on this, try proquest or any other academic database."

Bangladeshis would've suffered at the hands of a West Pakistani power imbalance and Islamabad would've had to spend an insane amount of resources taking care of East Pakistan, a region which to this day has the highest rates of poverty in South Asia and is actually the most densely populated country in the world.

pakistan,3co6n0,the_brown_stockton,6,Wed Jul 15 09:04:14 2015 UTC,My family belongs to a Sindhi Baloch tribe. Yes there is a tribal chief and he acts as a sort of a mayor for the tribe. I have only been to our village a handful of times as I usually stay with my mom's family in Karachi as it is not easy to go in/out of the village regularly because resources are scarce and tribal feuds are a very real thing
pakistan,3co6n0,khanabadoshi,2,Thu Jul 9 23:40:06 2015 UTC,"So what is the future of this tribe?  Do the non-village relatives show apathy towards it, or are they interested in it as more than a family name?"
pakistan,3co6n0,khanabadoshi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:45:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the power one man exerts in a tribe + cohesion of the tribe is related to one thing -- socio-economic standing of the majority of the tribe. If the people are poor and uneducated, the power of the chief is stronger and the people listen. With more education and/or money the less cohesive the tribe is in most matters and the less power a chief has.   Tribal society was born out of necessity in areas of scarce resources (Arab Bedouins, Mountainous Pashtuns, Desert/Hill Baluch, Barren-land Interior Sindh). You had to stick together and be disciplined to survive. With economic progress and urbanization this need is less and the tribal aspect becomes largely ceremonial.   The Bhuttos and Zardaris are powerful because their domains have a large population and are uneducated and poor; huge votebanks for the price of nothing. The people believe that their leaders are working for them with chants of social equality etc. It's the biggest irony though that the day the Zardari-Bhuttos empower their tribe in any meaningful way, is the day that they lose power.  This same model can be applied to all of Pakistan and most likely India as well. Just replace tribal leader with the 4th-time incumbent politician who comes from the 3rd generation to represent the constituency. ...At least most tribal chiefs talk to their people, so there is a silver lining."
pakistan,3co6n0,khanabadoshi,5,Tue Jul 14 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"Tribes in the genealogical sense are only found amongst the Baluch (and Brahui) and Pashtoon. It is different from a caste/zaat in the sense that you are blood relations via a common ancestor. So if you meet someone from your tribe you immediately know that this person and I share some blood -- this makes the sense of community strong. As far as them being organized it depends on the region. For example, Bugtis are an organized Baluch Tuman (tribe) however, the Jatois are not. At one time most tribes were organized, but as different parts of the tribes moved to other areas or lost languages, the cohesion withered with the broad aspect of the tribe. An example being, the Rohilla Pathans of Uttar Pardesh, who are all of the Yousafzai Pashtun. With Ranjit Singh's advances The Durrani Empire was cut off from that region and as such the Pashtun soldiers garrisoned there lost touch with their main tribe and gradually assimilated. To the modern descendants of these societies the concept of a caste is alien. This remains true even though the proto-Pashtoon were Hindu in the early Vedic era before castes were rigorously assigned; subsequently, becoming the ""Pakhtyans"" casted-Bhuddist; and finally, the Kabul Shahi Hindu-era casted-Pashtoon before mass conversion during the 13th century conquest of the Ghaznavids. Akin to the Sindhis, the Pashtoon, while being Hindu/Buddhist and thus assigned a caste, held tribal affiliation paramount and reserved caste designation for religious, leadership, and marriage roles.   Contrast this with other groups in region and you begin to appreciate the complexities of contemporary Pakistani society -- and why asking a question like, ""ap ki zaat ky haan?"" demonstrates a narrow understanding of history of the region.  Sindhis are tribal, not in the sense of shared relation, but instead by place/town. This is not surprising, as Sindhis are the most native people to lands of modern Pakistan. Thus, they are more appropriately described as being clans. Being aboriginal to the region and not apart of the Vedic resettlement from the Indus Valley area to the Gangetic plains -- where Vedic culture evolved into systemic stratification and Hinduism -- the majority of Sindhis were not assigned a caste. This is why even Hindu Sindhis today exist for the most part outside of the standard Vedic caste system. As such, the pre-modern Hindus of the Ashoka era described them as disgraced Hindus. The Arab invasions further disintegrated what little semblance of caste there was, while significant Baluch settlement in the 15th century gave rise to the Sindhi-Baluch tribes (40% of Sindh) and the feudal system as it exists today. This leads us a native people of Sindh who existed outside BOTH Hindu/Buddhist and Islamic influence until the 13th century -- the Jatt.  The Jatt are natives of Lower Sindh who were pastoral nomads and totally oblivious to the prevailing cultures; from the dawn of Vedic culture until the Arab rule of Sindh. With the Arab invasion, the Jatts moved North to lower Punjab and began farming. Until this migration none of Punjab was farmed. By the time the Ghazvanids attack the Qarmati Ismaili rulers of Multan (the main reason of his advance into the region), the Jatt had spread to all of Punjab, and east to the areas where they are now found. They began assimilating to the religion and language of the places they settled and integrated. By this time, they had perfected farming of the fertile lands and were the premier, if not only, agriculturists of the region. Hence, the modern association of Jatt = Farmer. Those that adapted Hinduism found great difficulty in being assigned a caste. Initially, they were considered Untouchable and by the 11th century considered Vaishya or Shudras. In the 17th century they lobbied for Kshatriya status, but were opposed by the Rajputs. Hence, it is not surprising that many Hindu Jatts swelled the ranks of Sikhism, which offered them social status that was not allowed under the Brahmani traditions. As such, Jatts (of all regions/religions) found themselves organized into tribe-like clans -- initially based on vicinity which, overtime, emerged into eventual blood-ties and relations. If you doubt that Jatts are of Sindhi-origin, all you have to do is look at DNA Y-Haplogroup clusters to see that the Jatts of ANY region cluster with Sindhis.  The majority of Southern Punjab is Jatt and this is evidenced by the language of the region being Saraiki -- a language on the spectrum between Sindhi and Punjabi. It is said, if Punjabi and Multani are cousins, then Multani and Sindhi are sisters.  Rajput is a caste falling under Kshatriyas. Their origin is uncertain, but all evidence leads to the probable suggestion that they are predominantly Jatts who may or may not have mixed with early Seva Huna invaders and/or Gurjars after the Gupta empire fell (6th cen. AD), but most certainly came into the fold of Hinduism much earlier than later Jatts. Some Hindu traditions mention that in the post-Gupta era Kshatriyas began exerting dominance over the Brahmins and that the Brahmins, fearing a power shift, called a grand meeting of all Bharatvarsha Brahmin's to the region of Rajputana where they deliberated and decided to initiate the existing people of the area as the new Kshatriyas, under the name of Rajput.  Essentially, Jatts, Rajputs, Gujjars, Dogris, Ahirs and similar groups are related, whether casted or not. Gujars/Dogars confuse people because are wide spread from Gujurat to Kashmir and many cities/towns/villages bear the names. They are the same group, but assimilated in different peoples.   Punjabis are perhaps the most complex in this regard as it comprises a large array of people from varying backgrounds. The Punjabi identity itself is youngest in the region, more so than the 15th century arrival of the Baluch, emerging in the 18th century.  The people of Punjab mainly consists of: Ahirs, Arains, Dalits (mostly Chamars), Gujjars, Jatts, Khatris, Tarkhans, Maliks, Brahmins and Rajputs. The overwhelming majority being low-caste or Dalit muslim converts.  Punjabi society is trifold, consisting of: Biradaris, Moeens, and Qoums.  Uncasted peoples (irrespective if they were of Hindu/Buddhist or local/foreign origin) coalesced to form Biradaris -- or tribes from a common ancestor.  Artisian occupational converts retained their caste designations based on occupation and are called Moeens, ie.  Lohar, Khateek, Rawal, Chhimba Darzi, Teli, Julaha, Mallaah, Mirasi. The Qoums/Zamindaris are of the upper echelons and own land. They generally consist of  Rajputs, Shaikhs, Gujjars, Gakhars, Dogars and Rahmani (Muslim Labana converts).  Within the Qoums is the oft-heard Chaudhary (literally meaning the ""holder of four"") -- a title given by the Mughals and/or the British Raj during Imperial rule  to those families who owned (or were awarded) large tracts of land as vassals for the Empire. Malik is a title in the same vein but doesn't imply nor deny zamindari status; it only affirms membership in the aristocracy. The names are not indicative of ethnicity or caste (it is common in Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Pakistan), however, due to the implication of wealth, the title is akin to being of a high caste. Thus, most Ch. do not know or neglect to mention their actual clan/tribal name prior to receiving the title. It is a fair to assume that most are Kalar Panwar, Rajputs, Jatts, Dhobi, Ahirs, Maheshri Bania, Gadaria, Gujar, Halwa and Mali in origin.   The Shaikhs (including Siddiquis, Qureshis, Khawajas, Awan, Arain), commonly claim Arab decent and membership of Banu Hashim or other tribes. However, DNA and historical evidence is quite conclusive that almost all, if not all, are 12th century Khatri or Brahmin (native to the region) converts to Islam. The majority being Khatri. Those who use the surname of Shaikh exclusively are more likely to be of Brahmin origin.  The Syeds, claim decent from the Prophet Muhammad. ie. Gilani, Jaffari, Naqvi, Rizvi, Mousavi, Hashimi, Hussaini, Hassani, Shareef. While, it is not easy to prove direct relation through DNA testing (as the lineage follows males until Ali and then uses Fatima to connect to the Prophet), you can rule out those who do not have a male lineage originated in the Arab/Bedouin OR Irani Haplogroup of J, and thus, are not of Near East decent at all from their male lineage. Using this methodology: Sunni Syeds/Shaikhs/Regular showed 1-2% Arab lineage. Shia Syeds/Alivis/Regular showed 2-5%. Dawoodi Bohra Ismailis showed 10-15% maternal Yemeni decent (giving credence to the Yemeni origin). Irani Shias (settled in South Asia the past 100-200 years) showed 40-45% Near East lineage (indicative of Irani origin not Arab). While this is not a full sample of every Muslim or Syed in the region, it gives strong evidence that the majority of Muslims claiming ANY Arab decent (Syed, Shaikh or otherwise) are in fact mistaken. To further cement the point, almost all Western Chinese Muslims tested showed clear paternal Arab decent (50-70%) -- A people with whom no one in the subcontinent associates with Arab lineage are in fact undeniably of Arab decent.  Of course the remainder of Punjab has Baluch (Arrive in Baluchistan proper by 11th century from Sistan/Kerman; 80-90% cross Indus River into Punjab in 15th century with Mir Chakar Khan dramatically changing Punjab and Sindh demographics and geneflow), Pashtoon (Continuous inflow from 11th century Ghaznavid invasion onwards) , and Kashmiri (Muslims converting in 13th-14th century) settlers who are of tribes and castes respectively.  The Burusho, Shina, Kho, Balti, Kalash are generally associated into respective clans from common ancestor.  I think I've summarized the major groups of people and their historical and current groupings. I hope you have a better understanding of the people and region now."

Both my grandmothers are Dars, and its a Kashmiri caste that's so commonplace that there isn't a concentrated tribe as such.  That being said our family takes our last name very seriously. When we turn 18 there's an entire ceremony involving document signing, oath affirming, etc. My grandfather took it upon himself to track down our ancestors and he managed to hit as far back as 1649, and managed to find those obscure connections between our family and Pirzadehs in Iran and Turkey. For some its a bit weird and surreal but I don't mind.  We don't really have a caste either. Dars are technically formerly-Brahmin Hindus and I'm not sure if Pirs are a caste themselves."

pakistan,3co6n0,khanabadoshi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:56:40 2015 UTC,"Pirzada is a title, like Chaudhry or Malik. It means, ""son of the Saint"". It's a Mughal-era title given to those who responsible for taking care of mausoleums. It is common in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.   The earliest recorded instance of the surname in the subcontinent lays in a Mughal court official named Nur-ud-din Pirzada, who served at the Serai Nurmahal in the city of Nurmahal in Punjab, in 1693.  The majority of Pirzadas are of Central Asian decent, coming in waves of migrations in the 14th century, hence, their widespread distribution from West Asia to South Asia. Their male lineages usually arise in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan. Technically, they should all have Turkic tribal names, however, most do not know their origins. The exception of Turkic- background belongs to the Kashmiri Pirzadas, who are of Kashmiri origin and thus, retained original surnames during conversion in the 13th century. It is later in the 15-16th century that they were given the title.   By the beginning of the British Raj the Pirzadas were mostly high-class artisans (rug-weaving etc.) who catered to the aristocracy and British nobles and were centered in Amritsar. At the time of partition the majority of Pirzadas lived in Amritsar and moved to Lahore, spreading out to various parts of West Punjab from there.   EDIT: This is a summary of the Wikipedia article for convenience. I'm obsessed with history, and my readings don't contrast with the information."

pakistan,3co6n0,khanabadoshi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"That is awesome! If you are interested in doing in-depth research for your sake and wikipedia, you can get more details by reading the British Raj's publication of the Indian Gazetter of various years. I believe the earliest edition is 1851. It is extremely lengthy. They go into detail of not only each district but each village, the people living there and the history. It goes into details in regards to the origins of almost every tribe/caste/title. Also Ain-ul-Akbari, Akbar's official biography describes many contemporary peoples. As they of Turkic origin moving in the 13-14 century they must have come into the area with the Ghaznavids. So Persian, Afghan, and Khawerzim chronicles in this era will most likely have definitive answers."
pakistan,3co6n0,bujassim,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:55:11 2015 UTC,"I have read the Indian Gazetter many times searching for Pirzadas. The issue is the name is an extension of ""Pir"" with the ""zada"" signifying a descendant. Pinpointing which Pir exactly contributed to the name is an impossible task without a time machine. Pir in itself is a generic title, which has always lead the family to believe that the name was probably adopted overnight within the span of one generation.  Even the earliest Pirzada we managed to find via the British Library was not a saint. And since we can't push any further back it becomes incredibly difficult who the original saint was.  My grandfather once wasted a lot of his time on his travels to Iran and Turkey in going to antiquated government and archive offices in order to establish some link between our ancestors from Punjab to the same last name in those two countries, but couldn't find anything.  It's a fucking miracle that we've managed to trace close to 350 years worth of ancestry, but I still wish we were a bit better at record-keeping. Europeans and their descendants seem to be much better at the habit."
pakistan,3co6n0,hugga4u,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:10:51 2015 UTC,"I always thought the Son-of-Saint meaning wasn't literal; That Pirzadas weren't related to each other or descended from one common person. I thought it was the title the Muslim world gave to people who were overlooking darbars -- and most of those people happen to be from central asia.   You are totally right about the record-keeping... beyond my grandfather... nothing. Hahaha. So I'd suggest you do something most Pakistanis are pretty scared to do.... a DNA test. You won't get exact answers from there, but you can rule out scenarios with the results. Also if other Pirzadas worldwide have done a test, you would show up as matches."

We were initially sent to Peshawar from Kandahar by king Ahmadshah when he sent his cousin / my ancestor Zardad Khan to be governor of the frontier region.   Yes we are a tightly knit group but so are all families. We don't live in our village any longer but visit it from time to time, potentially for weddings / funerals.   I suppose most of what you're imagining as tribal culture doesn't go on anymore, but we do resolve our disputes using Jirgas.   There are no tribal chiefs in our culture, there is often a village elder who is respected but that's all. In general the most powerful members of a tribe will end up being its de facto chiefs."
pakistan,3co6n0,TotallyNotObsi,2,Sat Jul 11 00:11:16 2015 UTC,"To actually answer your question though...  Yes. I belong to Dashti/Dasti Baloch tribe. However, as we are settled on the right bank of the Indus we speak Saraiki and no longer speak Balochi. We do maintain a Sardari system but not as rigorous or binding as one may see in Balochistan proper. The people of the tribe meet in large jirga fashion to discuss prevalent matters. This is especially true in matters of who to support for an election or events like the floods. There is a Sardari family, meaning chief family of the tribe, from whom the Tumandar (chief) is always from. Upon the death of one the whole tribe meets and discusses/selects/accepts the next leader. This is finalized by a respected elder wrapping the turban around the head of the new leader.   Most issues are usually land/qabza issues, thefts of cattle, settlement of debts, etc etc. These are mainly civil in nature and there isn't much of a hierarchy involved. It is more akin to arbitration by elders of the tribe, with consent from Sardari family.   Practically speaking, the main value of a tribal system as it exists in our tribe is not the feudal aspect as the tribe itself was a slave tribe of the Rind; neither the civil aspects as most disputes are minor and things don't usually get to a point of full-scale community involvement; but rather in 2015 the biggest benefit of being in a tribe of decent numbers and aligning with other tribes is that you can get the man you want elected locally -- whether or not the Establishment approves.   Those of you familiar with Pakistani politics must have heard the name of Jamshed Dasti.  Though the Sardari family disputes his claim of being a Dasti, they did not put obstacles in his way by nominating another candidate since the main bulk of the tribe supported him. However, even though he is an MNA and wielding considerable power (and was so at the time of the existing chief's death) no one of the tribe even considered him to be the next head. Status and wealth do not outweigh lineage in these matters.  As all tribes do, there are rivalries. But as the heads and people are not as jahil as before there is less violence. Historically, the Dastis and Khars of Kot Addu (Yes, Ghulam Mustafa and Hina Rabbani) are enemies and the Gurmanis (Mushtaq Ahmed) are/were (not sure anymore) allies. This is seen mostly in politics though.   Interesting side note though. The Khars are Jat and have a panchayat model. Ghulam Mustafa's daughter is Aminah Haq (model/actress). It is rather well known that G.M. issued and edict to his clan and allies that should she ever enter into Muzaffargarh district to kill her on sight. I don't know if this is still standing or even if it was just widespread rumor.  A very bad example of Sardari tribal system is the Mukhtara Mai case, also in Muzaffargarh.

In June 2002, Mukhtār Mā'ī was the survivor of a gang rape as a form of honour revenge, on the orders of a tribal council of the local Mastoi Baloch clan that was richer and more powerful as opposed to her Tatla clan in that region.    Although custom would expect her to commit suicide after being raped,    Mukhtaran spoke up, and pursued the case, which was picked up by both domestic and international media. On 1 September 2002, an anti-terrorism court sentenced 6 men (including the 4 rapists) to death for rape. In 2005, the Lahore High Court cited ""insufficient evidence"" and acquitted 5 of the 6 convicted, and commuted the punishment for the sixth man to a life sentence. Mukhtaran and the government appealed this decision, and the Supreme Court suspended the acquittal and held appeal hearings.  In 2011, the Supreme Court too acquitted the accused.  Though the safety of Mukhtaran, and her family and friends, has been in jeopardy  she remains an outspoken advocate for women's rights. She started the Mukhtar Mai Women's Welfare Organization to help support and educate Pakistani women and girls. In April 2007, Mukhtar Mai won the North-South Prize from the Council of Europe.

However, on 8 April 2007, the New York Times reported that Mukhtar Mai lives in fear for her life from the Pakistan government and local feudal lords.  General Pervez Musharraf, the former president of Pakistan, has admitted on his personal blog  that he placed restrictions on her movement in 2005, as he was fearful that her work, and the publicity it receives, hurt the international image of Pakistan.

pakistan,3cntpf,Zazazakana,2,Thu Jul 9 16:48:07 2015 UTC,So what solution do you propose to the terrorism in Pakistan that doesnt involve using military force?
pakistan,3cntpf,ahyuknyuk,-4,Thu Jul 9 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"Armed resistance is needed, but it has to come from the people themselves. The government can arm the lashkars in those areas, instead of completely betraying them to the Taliban. I'm not going to support military operations carried out by a force that has more blood on its hands than the Taliban do (1971, Balochistan) and which continues to use religious extremists as proxies."
pakistan,3cntpf,Zazazakana,8,Thu Jul 9 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"And how would this result in less bloodshed?  It might even result in more considering a conflict between two groups which have more or less the same firepower will last longer.  In order to drive the Taliban out quickly we need jets, helicopters, heavy artillery and a professional disciplined armed force.  Doing it your way would only result in prolonging the conflict.  And how are Bangladesh and Balochistan even relevant? Bangladesh and Balochistan had/have armed independence movements which should have been dealt with politically but they werent so thats how it turned out.  The TTP and IMU however have the goal of creating pockets of their own territory in Pakistan ruled under medieval Shariah law. They want to expand these pockets of territory as far as they can and use them to export their brand of Salafi terror into the neighboring regions. This is intolerable and absolutely requires our army to hit them as hard as they can.  Have you been to Swat recently? I was there about a year ago. Ask them what life was like for them under the Taliban and ask them if they like being governed by the Taliban or the army(practically zero presence of the police or civilian government in Swat, all security and administration is carried out by the army)."
pakistan,3cntpf,ahyuknyuk,-4,Thu Jul 9 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"In order to drive the Taliban out quickly we need jets, helicopters, heavy artillery and a professional disciplined armed force.   Yeah, and that means tons of civilian casualties. Just because you don't hear about them because of the media blackout doesn't mean it's not an issue. Just look at pictures of Miranshah now. Its been reduced to rubble. It looks like Aleppo or Gaza.  The Taliban are guerrilla fighters and it would be good to fight them with an unconventional force. The lashkars know the area, the language, and how to fight. I'd much rather have well armed militias defending their communities than have the Pakistan Army commit its war crimes.   And how are Bangladesh and Balochistan even relevant?   My point was about the brutality of the army. The historical record is very clear. The Pakistan Army is an institution that has committed genocide against its own people (Bengalis were Pakistanis at the time).   Have you been to Swat recently? I was there about a year ago. Ask them what life was like for them under the Taliban and ask them if they like being governed by the Taliban or the army(practically zero presence of the police or civilian government in Swat, all security and administration is carried out by the army).    Lmao, I'm from Malakand and lived in Swat for seven years."
pakistan,3cntpf,Zazazakana,8,Thu Jul 9 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and that means tons of civilian casualties. Just because you don't hear about them because of the media blackout doesn't mean it's not an issue. Just look at pictures of Miranshah now. Its been reduced to rubble. It looks like Aleppo or Gaza.   Name one conflict without civilian casualties. And doing it your way would make the conflict last at least 8 to 10 years, because a tribal lashkar does not have the destructive power that a jet or helicopter does, a lashkar could take 3 days to destroy a Taliban stronghold whereas 3 jets can do it in 15 minutes. This way it should be done in two, with the military remaining in the region to keep security and prevent the Taliban from regaining a foothold.   The Pakistan Army is an institution that has committed genocide against its own people (Bengalis were Pakistanis at the time).   Its been 44 years. Anyone involved in the 1971 atrocities is dead or retired. Name one army which one could not accuse of genocide or needless slaughter during an armed conflict.   Lmao, I'm from Malakand and lived in Swat for seven years.   Then you must have heard the stories right? Women flogged in public because a little too much skin could be seen on their wrists? People having their ears cut off for listening to music? The collapse of the tourism industry which feeds and clothes a large segment of the Swati population? Trout farmers having their water reservoirs poisoned because they failed to pay the Taliban their extortion money? Parents having their children stolen from them so that their boys can turned into suicide bombers and their daughters can be married to Taliban commanders?  The Pakistan army has a lot of blood on its hands, because it is a military force. And a military is the institutionalization of violence. Its that simple.  However the Pakistan army does not commit all those atrocities committed by the Taliban I mentioned above."
pakistan,3cntpf,ahyuknyuk,-5,Thu Jul 9 19:11:55 2015 UTC,"Name one conflict without civilian casualties.   Is that your argument? No conflicts are nonviolent, but some are carried out more carefully than others. The operations launched by the Pakistan Army are worse than what the Americans do in Afghanistan. You can't justify war crimes and atrocities by simply saying that other military offensives result in deaths too.   Its been 44 years. Anyone involved in the 1971 atrocities is dead or retired. Name one army which one could not accuse of genocide or needless slaughter during an armed conflict.   The Pakistan Army is an institution, not some random group of individuals. If you want to understand the way it operates, you study the historical record. That's what serious people do. Even if you think the army is different from what it was like during 1971, I also mentioned Balochistan. What the army is doing there is absolutely unacceptable. Or look at what they did in Okara. Or their secret policy of murdering journalists. Or all the coups and years of military dictatorship. The fact remains that the army you love so much is a brutal institution, and counting on it to take care of a mess that it created itself is practically the definition of delusion.   Then you must have heard the stories right?   Yes, I heard them from my own family. I also heard about the indiscriminate bombing of densely populated areas, the arbitrary abductions, the torture of suspected militants, the extrajudicial executions, the dropping of bodies form helicopters, the violence against independent journalists, and the public display of mutilated prisoners in the markets. See, you seem to think I support the Taliban, which is why you needlessly mentioned their crimes to me. I don't. I'm against negotiations and operations. You, OTOH, do support the army and its murderous operations, which is why I'm telling you all this.   However the Pakistan army does not commit all those atrocities committed by the Taliban I mentioned above.   So? That means absolutely nothing at all. As I stated earlier, the Pakistan Army commits violence in its own way."
pakistan,3cntpf,Zazazakana,5,Thu Jul 9 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"The operations launched by the Pakistan Army are worse than what the Americans do in Afghanistan.   Now thats a VERY bold claim. I didnt downvote any of your comments before this because thats an immature thing to do in a debate but I did downvote this one because of this.  Not only was the American occupation of Afghanistan a needless conflict which the the conflict in FATA is NOT(The war in Afghanistan was about retribution, the war in FATA is about protecting the people of Pakistan from an enemy. The American people were protected from Afghan militants by the North Atlantic Ocean and the combined landmass of Europe and Central Asia. The people of Pakistan are not), you seem to think the American Army does not torture(unless you believe 'enhanced interrogation' is not torture), you seem to think that the American military does not abduct and worst of all America launched stupid war without an endgame in mind.   I also mentioned Balochistan.   Balochistan, like I said earlier is an independence movement. The problem their is that its a group of people who do not want to identify themselves as Pakistani. The conflict against the Taliban is not an independence movement it is an occupation by a group of criminals(many of who are not even Pakistani) who want to topple the state and create their own emirate. What gives these scum the real courage to go about doing this is their belief that if they use civilians and civilian areas as shields against the Pakistan army they wont have to face the Pakistan army. Doing it your way proves them right.   The fact remains that the army you love so much...   I dont love the Pakistan Army, I believe its actions in the past have been wrong and have been wrong often and that its the old fatcat generals in the amry who are mainly the reason we still havent been able to have peace with India yet, peace which we need very much. However, I do know that for all its sins its the only stabilizing force in Pakistan, and if things dont get better for Pakistan it is the only institution which will be able to prevent balkanization and civil war.  I also know that if I am passing through a security check post I am much more likely to be harassed by a policeman who belongs to an institution run by the civilian government than by a soldier who belongs to the Pakistan Army. I respect and like talking to the lower and middle ranking members of the army. They are not the fatcat generals I mentioned above, they are men who follow orders, they do it well and they understand the concept of 'protect and serve' far better than the Pakistan Police.   Yes, I heard them from my own family. I also heard about the indiscriminate bombing of densely populated areas, the arbitrary abductions, the torture of suspected militants, the extrajudicial executions, the dropping of bodies form helicopters, the violence against independent journalists, and the public display of mutilated prisoners in the markets.   That this stuff happens is a sad reality and I cannot defend it. However, I will say that people in Pakistan do not respect the writ of state. They respect their own tribes, traditions, sects, religion etc. Countries cannot function this way. Were things different perhaps the Pakistan Army would not have to resort to this kind of terrorism(I'll admit this is terrorism). At the end of the day even in a place where nobody respects anything, everyone respects a loaded gun.  And the nature of the media in Pakistan is also a reason for all the secrecy. Remember how after the Lal Masjid incident somehow the army was seen as the bad guy and Abdul Rahid Ghazi was a hero? Even though anyone with a brain could see that the army and police gave them every chance to surrender peacefully. Gave them every chance to send out the women and children.  And this is the nature of guerrilla warfare in which one side is made up of insurgents who move in and out of the civilian population and the other side is a large, professional military with access to modern weapons and other tools of war. At the end of the day, the side which can keep fighting the longest wins. Its interesting because the FATA warzone is in Pakistan, even if nobody in the Pakistan Army is from that area. However a large number of the Taliban fighting force is Arab, Afghan, Uzbek, Chechen and Uighur so they also have places they can run to and not come back.  I'm not going to debate this with you any more. You want the fight against Taliban to have the minimum number of civilian casualties even if it means risking the war by using an inferior fighting force and I want the Taliban defeated using the only professional military we have. So we'll never agree. Whats the point?"

I'm talking about the way the two wars are being waged. Yeah, the Americans commit war crimes, but it pales in comparison to what happens in Pakistani military operations. With all the media and investigative reporting going on, we see a few cases of abuse being uncovered every once in a while with the Americans. In FATA and KPK, however, journalists aren't even allowed to operate freely and there are still hundreds of proven atrocities. It's all documented by leading rights groups, I can link their reports to you if you'd like. Just to give you an example, a few years ago, a mass grave was uncovered in Bajaur. Locals talked about the Pakistan army rounding up people arbitrarily and shooting them up. Did you even hear about this in the media? If something like that had happened in Afghanistan and the media heard about it, they would at least pretend to have an investigation, because there is some kind of accountability there. There's none here.   Balochistan, like I said earlier is an independence movement. The problem their is that its a group of people who do not want to identify themselves as Pakistani.   Again, you miss the point. I'm not comparing the Baloch to the Taliban, I'm talking about the army and its terrible human rights record. If they regularly commit crimes in Balochistan, they're probably doing the same in the tribal areas.   You want the fight against Taliban to have the minimum number of civilian casualties even if it means risking the war by using an inferior fighting force and I want the Taliban defeated using the only professional military we have.   And you somehow believe that the same group of thugs who created these militants (and continue to use them in certain places) bombing the shit out of FATA is the solution. Operations have been launched before and the Taliban are still there, but you can believe what you want to believe, dude."

Due to the poor performance of the provincial law department, an unbelievable mistake was made while seeking passage of the Ehtesab Commission Act, 2014 from the KP Assembly. In its original form, the act allowed probing cases from 2014 onward only. The assembly was asked in early April to amend the act so that corruption cases from 2004 onward could also be probed.

pakistan,3ck9dp,txs2300,8,Wed Jul 8 16:41:59 2015 UTC,Literally every HUMTV drama has a cousin marriage. Even Humsafar. I enjoy them but I think they should take into account what it is they're portraying and the masses of public they beam the show to.
pakistan,3ck9dp,IzmailPirzada,6,Wed Jul 8 17:19:56 2015 UTC,Well they are common and people can relate to them.  Tv and movies are a reflection of society.
pakistan,3ck9dp,txs2300,4,Wed Jul 8 17:35:57 2015 UTC,Just because it is a common practice doesn't mean its an optimal one. I just find it a bit odd that one of the country's largest media conglomerates produces shows in which cousin marriage is by default either present or a key component of the plot.
pakistan,3ck9dp,IzmailPirzada,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:04 2015 UTC,Ok I had thought that cousin marriage was a norm in Pakistan after watching those shows. :-|
pakistan,3ck9dp,okonawi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:00:42 2015 UTC,"It varies by demographic to city to income levels and so much more, because marriage is a complicated manner.  The elite do not do it anymore. It is highly frowned upon and considered something ""the backwards classes do."" The exception is perhaps feudals who practice it retain property and wealth within the family.  Some middle-class families do it because it is easy, most try not to at first before resorting to the cousin as it is convenient.   At the rural lower-class it is far more common, with the rate of cousin marriage perhaps being a slim majority over non-cousin unions. Again, since these people aren't in the cities, our general view is that it isn't the norm.  Like I said, its difficult to figure out whether we should classify this as a norm or not. Despite that, I still find it eerie that its portrayed in a perfectly normal setting on television."
pakistan,3ck9dp,IzmailPirzada,2,Thu Jul 9 06:11:39 2015 UTC,"I do not know any ""elite"" people but I know of a lot of middle-class families who do this. From what I assume they do it because they do not allow their boys or girls to socialize with the opposite sex and so either the parents end up doing an arranged marriage or an arranged cousin marriage.  I almost feel that since it is portrayed as the norm it has lead to maybe an increase in cousin marriage."

A disease that is not uncommon in Pakistan, mainly because of cousin marriages I think.  Some of them also had 6th fingers or 6th toes which they had removed. I know this because I saw one of them in sandals one day and saw a 6th toe. I told my sister about it and she told me about the other people in the family who had had theirs removed.  They are all also obese. Though this is probably more related to lifestyle.  Ofcourse vitiligo and extra toes can happen to anyone, but the chances you will have these disorders increases when there has been inbreeding for generations."
pakistan,3ck9dp,ahyuknyuk,5,Wed Jul 8 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"these disorders increases when there has been inbreeding for generations.   I was hoping that there would be at least one person who points this out. I'm a med student and we had a discussion on this a few months back.   Marrying a first cousin increases the chances of an abnormality in children but it is not too significant to consider if this is the first time that a cousin marriage is taking place. That is, both the bride and groom's parents are from (three) different families but if the second generation also marries within the extended family than your chances of children with abnormalities increases exponentially.  Remember, humans started with small groups of hunters and gatherers and a lot, and I mean a lot of incest took place and yet, here we are."
pakistan,3ck9dp,wildcard5,4,Wed Jul 8 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"The issue in Pakistan is that families with a tradition for cousin marriages do so to keep their wealth and property within the family and because in some of the subcultures outsiders are always distrusted. Its traditional.  So families that are into cousin marriage have been drinking from the same glass for a very long time.  Edit: Its also possible, that if Pakistans attitude on sex and genders mixing was different then people would be less likely to be attracted to their cousins.

Some gems from Kaptaan obvious:   He suggested the government should focus on capitalising on the large renewable resources of green energy, such as hydro, solar, wind and nuclear, to end the energy crisis.   Oh yeah. Why didn't the government think of such amazing ideas! /s  The government is building the largest PV park in the world. More than a dozen dams are under construction. Nuclear plants are being constructed.   “we need to create a focused adaptation plan to deal with climate-related disasters and also invest in climate-resilient infrastructure development in the country.”   Yes, everybody knows that. More obvious bullshit and no substance.   His government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has made climate change a priority, he said, with the allocation of two billion rupees (around $20m) to focus on green initiatives. “Our focus is on forestry, national parks, green energy development – all of which create natural climate mitigation and adaptation measures. In comparison, the Punjab government slashed their environment ministry budget by 75% from last year,” he said.   Once again, very little substance. Just vague phrases and finger pointing at Punjab.

Military spending includes people's salaries, including soldiers, officers, factory workers, janitors, clerks, gardners, mechanics, etc, electric and utility bills, building rentals, research and development, operating costs of vehicles and equipment. You can't cut all of those things for 8 days a year. A lot of people can not afford it. You might think that the wealthier higher ranks are getting paid the big bucks, and eight days of salary is nothing for them, but the lower ranks are in the huge numbers who stack up the payroll bills, and they can absolutely not afford cuts to their salary, when they are already paying for public education from their taxes."

When a lead pellet from an airgun hits something it gets blunt and disfigured. That on top of the fact that there isnt much power behind an airgun makes a ricocheted pellet pretty non lethal.  The only dangerous places to get hit by an airgun pellet is the face. Particularly the eyes. And I hear the underside of the wrist, because the skin is very thin and there are a lot of blood vessels there(this would make genitals an equally dangerous place to get hit I suppose).  Back then pellets came in two sizes in Pakistan. Number 1 and Number 2. 1's are smaller. Maybe 2's are more dangerous.

Edit: if anyone takes my suggestion regarding using an air gun to take care of their lizard problem, please remember that they are not toys. Cicerotulli has already pointed out a mishap that happened with him. Lizards are not very thick so when you shoot them the pellet will go through them an ricochet of the wall, making where they go very unpredictable so shoot at a safe distance. Inform anyone you cohabit with of what you are doing so that nobody accidentally walks into the line of fire. Also, watch out for crows. They recognise guns and if they see you with it, they will make a lot of noise, gather all their friends and they could attack you.

My Chinese gun shot at a slight angle, but unless the gun is seriously fucked up you can learn to work with its flaws. After all, all you want to do is kill lizards.

I asked him a few days ago if the CSS was still a good way for a Pakistani to make an honest living out of college (I'm 19, studying abroad). He said the following:   The top n candidates in terms of score get their choice of ministry. Other than that, the quota system introduced by Bhutto is bound to fuck over anyone from a privileged background.  The CSS exam is riddled with fraud and deception simply because of the quota system. Apparently there are hundreds of candidates from major urban centres whose fathers register their domiciles as being from rural Baluchistan or the Kashmir and Baltistan territories. This ensures the quota swings in their favour even though they were born and raised in middle-class Karachi or Lahore. Lastly, he said that the civil service as an entity itself has gone from a bureaucracy composed of men and women who just wanted to serve Pakistan (as idealistic as it sounds) to being the only avenue for economic mobility amongst the poor. So basically, its become a pipeline by which people who have no other prospects in life improve their livelihoods.   It would be foolish to assume, though, that there aren't high-level bureaucrats who take their jobs very seriously without taking bribes and performing their duties to the fullest.

pakistan,3cdcsb,thezainyzain,-2,Tue Jul 7 03:01:08 2015 UTC,What nomenclature seems fair to you?  EDIT: The downvotes for a question directly related to /u/thezainyzain are really funny :)
pakistan,3cdcsb,Paranoid__Android,11,Tue Jul 7 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"I know it won't solve the Kashmir disputed but it changes the point of view of the reader. Especially a foreign reader. I can assure everyone that Azad Kashmir is in no way ""occupied"" by Pakistan Army. We are happily and willingly a part of Pakistan and never hope to join India or welcome them as our ""liberators"". Unfortunately same cannot be said for the Indian Occupied Kashmir"
pakistan,3cdcsb,thezainyzain,6,Tue Jul 7 04:38:15 2015 UTC,"I understand where things are today, but from an Indian standpoint - the King who was the constitutional ruler of the state acceded the whole state to India, and not just the current day Indian J&K. This is why from an Indian perspective, POK seems like a fair nomenclature.   However, I can see how from your standpoint things look different. I have no desire for POK / Azad Kashmir to be part of India. You answered as if my question was ""what would you like the nomenclature to be"". My question was different.   Now, in my mind at least, Azad Kashmir is not really ""Azad"". It is part of Pakistan now, and India should accept it. Similarly, J&K is part of India as of now. I know that Pakistan disputes it just as India disputes POK. The rest of the world just does not give a fuck, as both of us know. Thus, in my mind, the nomenclature needs to switch to Pakistani Kashmir and Indian Kashmir, or West Kashmir and East Kashmir (which stays factual, and has less to do with subjective distinctions).  This POK, IOK, AZAD Kashmir bullshit is now 3 generations old. We need to move on from both the sides.   Let us be honest, if the HUGE terrorism related spend in 1991 (when India was so weak economically that it almost defaulted, and so weak politically that it was changing governments every 1 year) could not get Kashmir free, then Kashmir is not getting free from the India of Modi in 2014-2018.   So would be great, if we all moved on, but that is just one displaced Kashmiri's view.   BTW: If the presence of Army creates a ""Country-Occupied-State"" nomenclature, then would you be OK with a ""Pakistan-Occupied-FATA"" and ""Pakistan-Occupied-Balochistan""?"

All of those who think India was unreasonable in getting Hyderabad in India, should read about the Kalat Episode.  Jinnah, had no compunctions about getting Kalat to join them eventually."

Those aren't the thoughts of Jinnah, they're the thoughts of the guy who wrote it, who said further down in the thread that it's the 'Indian position'.   All of those who think India was unreasonable in getting Hyderabad in India, should read about the Kalat Episode.   Do you think India was reasonable in militarily invading and annexing Hyderabad after the Nizam chose for independence? If so, do you agree that Pakistan was/is reasonable in its cause to liberate Kashmir (in line with the Kashmiri's wishes)?  If the answer to the last question is no, then you must at least agree that India was unreasonable (an understatement) in invading and annexing Junagadh after the Nawab chose to accede to Pakistan; so as not to look like a hypocrite."
pakistan,3cdcsb,thealphamale1,7,Tue Jul 7 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"I had the same discussion with a young dil-dil-Pakistan kid a couple of days back. Here is my position  TL;DR: What India did was not OK from a Hyderabad standpoint, but it was a geopolitical necessity. Refer the map below.  India was not representing interests of Hyderabadis, but its own geopolitical. India had 100 odd princely states that were independently existing in India then. A country could have collapsed from such craziness.   Again, in case of Bangladesh, India did  not really go in because of bleeding heart for Bangladeshis, or an animosity towards Pakistan, but because there were millions of refugees coming into India!  On Junagarh, India has the weakest legal position, as it is exact political opposite of Kashmir (minus the size, minus the contiguity). However, again just look at the map. Tell me, how is Junagarh-e-Pakistan the right construct. This is just like Kalat-e-Baloch tried to come to India, and India said nope."

Even today, land laws make it incredibly difficult for any Indian to settle in Kashmir, whereas Kashmiris face no such problem in any other state. So, I don't see how 'Azad' Kashmir is any more 'Azad', apart from its name.  Please stop trying to make this a pissing contest.

pakistan,3c7ozi,bilaljshahid,44,Sun Jul 5 17:50:37 2015 UTC,That's my mother on the far left! She was just 18! When this picture first showed up in one of Paracha's articles she went apeshit.   She had actually run away from our Nana's house in Islamabad and hopped on a wagon for Lahore to take part in this. Later she was booked randomly by police and my grandfather was heavily embarrassed because he was a Grade-21 civil servant and his entire office had heard about my mother. Luckily she wasn't reprimanded too heavily by my grandparents.  Those were very awkward times for Pakistanis. Zia introduced idiosyncrasies which people didn't understand but approved of regardless. Stuff like my grandfather having to throw out his safari suits for the office and swap them with iron-pressed shalwaar kameez based on his directives.
pakistan,3c7ozi,IzmailPirzada,7,Sun Jul 5 21:12:33 2015 UTC,WHOA!  This is so interesting!  Where are you now?  You should share this on a main subreddit like /r/pics or something.
pakistan,3c7ozi,ryzvonusef,15,Mon Jul 6 00:37:33 2015 UTC,"I'm in Canada, studying at university.  2 years after this picture my mother was in Montreal studying. She met my dad there and they married. She then finished her Bachelor's, moved to England, had my siblings while finishing up more school, moved to Saudi Arabia where my little pompous self was born and went to high-school. She still lives in Saudi as my dad still works there, and rotates between the country and Pakistan to visit the grandparents.  I would submit this but I once tried to submit a pretty sweet picture of my great-grandparents to r/oldschoolcool but it got downvoted heavily before I removed it.

pakistan,3c7ozi,IzmailPirzada,8,Mon Jul 6 01:03:45 2015 UTC,Does she regret joining the political protest? does you family have any political views now?  Do you think your family would be supportive if you did something in a similar vein?
pakistan,3c7ozi,ryzvonusef,12,Mon Jul 6 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"No, she doesn't regret it at all. Even my grandparents now are proud of her for doing it. The Pakistan that Zia created was not the Pakistan my mother and father were born into. From what they tell me they were born into a country that was a hybrid of India and Sufism but turned into a clusterfuck of sectarian nonsense.   In terms of political views now, my dad is apathetic as he's been out of Pakistan for at least four decades, and my own Dada was one of the people who he feels was a part of the gang that turned the country onto the wrong footing (my username gives a slight hint as to who he was). Obviously he won't say this out loud to his own father but both him and my uncle retain minimal contact with my Dada for these reasons.  My mom doesn't hold any political views anymore. She enjoyed Imran Khan for a while before he made many sour with his dharnas.  If I did something similar today my parents would scold me for missing out on other productive tasks and being irresponsible, but within a week they'd understand my reasons."

pakistan,3c8dob,satnavtomington,2,Sun Jul 5 21:26:34 2015 UTC,"Feudal lords who supported British Raj were rewarded with land, power and wealth. When the Raj decided to rule by proxy it used the idea of nation states, bunch of upper class Muslims created Muslim League and subsequently Pakistan came into being using religion as tool to promote the idea of nation state, despite nothing in Quran and Sunnah mentions such a thing nor current state is Islamic.  A bit far away Khilafat was being killed by British Raj and most God fearing Muslims refused to take part in attack against them and revolted. One group the Punjabi Mussulmans decided to be loyal to Raj than to Khilafat so they have been prolifically providing foot soldiers against the Khilafat Osmania. In return they got lands, power from British Raj.   Most of the upper and middle Army comprise of Punjabi musulmans of past so any overthrow by power is out of question since boots to the face are used to keep everyone subservient. If anyone oppose the feudal system is killed e.g. Bhutto. You cannot tax land owners. Maulvis can't give fatwa on zakat they don't give.   So current feudal system are bunch of medieval cronies put into to power via Army, Government, Bureaucracy, and  Clergy to promote Anglo American policies in the region."
pakistan,3c7j9d,Cicerotulli,-1,Sun Jul 5 16:57:31 2015 UTC,He just accused a CM of Punjab of rigging 70 polling stations in all 4 provinces. I feel so sorry for any intelligent person who supported IK in 2013.

God bless this country and its ""intellectual"" armchair political analysts."
pakistan,3c7j9d,FPSreznov,4,Sun Jul 5 19:57:45 2015 UTC,Yeah. Screw the intellectuals with their logic and fancy words.   Half of those 35 punctures identified by PTI were in provinces other than Punjab. How can a CM of one province rig elections in other provinces?
pakistan,3c7j9d,FPSreznov,0,Sun Jul 5 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"Alright so lets assume for the sake of argument that PTI's take on the 35 punctures was wrong...(and I'm willing to concede on that position in real life as well; people make mistakes and that whole debacle, on IK's part, was a move that was poorly executed.)  Give me a satisfying answer however to one question  and one question only and I'll drop my anti Sethi stance  Q: What were his credientials towards the Cricketing field that convinced King Nawaz to appoint him as director of PCB? Why, out of all the Cricketing and administrative gurus in our country was he awarded that position?"

Either the people claiming these things are very retarded, or extremely cunning, power hungry and opportunistic because they knows their retarded followers will lap up whatever bullshit they dish out.  Heading PCB is a managerial job, like any other large corporation. It needs someone hardworking, intelligent, incorruptible and with leadership skills. Its not supposed to be a fucking team manager/coach. For example, BMW hired a pharmaceutical executive to its board of directors last year. Besides, Sethi was not liked by PMLN at all. NS threw him in prison back in 98/99 when he told BBC about the corruption in their regime. Sethi was part of the interim government back in 97 too. He is one of the richest men in the country, with his wife heir to the Mitchell's farm fortune. He doesn't need these petty favors. Sethi was PPP's choice for CM, to which PTI also agreed. PMLN still dislikes him because he went out of his way to put neutral people in place for the elections.  Initially IK said Sethi is being sent to PCB so he can give broadcasting rights to GEO. When that didn't happen, he came up with this new theory. BTW, what were the qualifications for Zaka Ashraf and Sharyar Khan to become heads of PCB?"

How many corporations has he headed? How many institutions has he led? Last time I checked, he was just an average journalist in GEO.Please cut the bullshit. Sethi does not have cricketing experience neither does he have any administrative experience. No where in the world do journalists get appointed as heads of cricketing boards. The ECB for example has an entrepreneur as its chief. The Australian Cricketing Board also has a cricketer and an businessman as its director.  Again, I ask, what credentials did Najam Sethi have that qualified him for that administrative position? He had NO experience in either administrative jobs or cricketing jobs.  You're really gonna sit here and tell me that he wasn't rewarded for his ""efforts"" as interim CM? How stupid do you think the rest of the world is? I'm a Pakistani and so are you and we both know how things work. And things do not work the way you've painted them; we both know that.    Sethi was not liked by PMLN at all. NS threw him in prison back in 98/99   This is politics mere Bhai.. ""You scratch my back and I scratch yours"" applies in full effect here. If you think past history matters in current political decisions, you are blatantly misinformed. If it did, Zardari wouldn't have supported Nawaz during Dharna and Nawaz wouldn't have recommended Mamnoon ""to learn from President Zardari"" during his farewell dinner.   He doesn't need these petty favors   Being appointed director of an organization worth more than $55 million dollars is a ""petty favor?""    BTW, what were the qualifications for Zaka Ashraf and Sharyar Khan to become heads of PCB?   Nothing. No qualifications. PCB has never had meritocracy in it.

Sethi does not have cricketing experience neither does he have any administrative experience.   When you're so ignorant, you shouldn't act so cocky.  To help with your poor reading comprehension, I will use bullet points now, with explanations following, and this is as far as I'm willing to hold your hand and give you taleem-e-balghan.   The man is a recipient of two press freedom awards (Amnesty International and CPJ) and Hilal-e-Pakistan.   This is to point out that the man has an impeccable reputation as a journalist.   He is an economist from Cambridge. He established and runs a well known publishing house and TFT.   This is to point out that he is a well rounded successful businessman. Cricket is business.   Grab a proxy and watch him interviewing IK on youtube. Here's the timestamped link. Being the nice guy that I am, I will quote what IK said to him in the very beginning (as faithfully as I can): 'Jab ap siasat ke expert thay.. yaani shuru se.. jab se main janta hoon.. shuru.. kionke main tau apko bohot purana janta hoon. Jab main cricket khelta tha, aur ap cricket ke bohot.. ye keh loon ke bohot andarr.. se ap cricket ke follower thay... deep follower thay. Tau main samajta hoon kai meray se bohot pehlay se ap siasat samajhtay thay.""   There you have it, from the horse's mouth.   Nothing. No qualifications. PCB has never had meritocracy in it. But that doesn't mean you should overlook Sethi's appointment which you still failed to justify in your answer.   Sheryar Khan was first appointed by Mushi, then by PPP and then by PMLN. The man has delivered. Sethi had an interim job of ensuring PCB's constitution is brought back to its fair form, he has done that faithfully. Should PCB be an independent body? Of course. Should the government have no influence in appointing its head? Sure. Should PCB's head only be an ex-cricketer who knows shit about running a business? Fuck no. But that is for another day to discuss.   You're in a situation where Arif Alvi says we should apologize. Now it's time to ask you the question: How can you prove that Sethi scratched NS's back? Correlation is not causation. If you're going to give Lickman and Shahid Doomsday as your sources, you'd be better off mentioning that in the first line so I don't have to bother with this potential exercise in futility.  Edit: Please also let me know about any corruption that he has committed while heading PCB. I'm sure IK would bring that out if he sniffed it."
pakistan,3c6ikf,Drudeboy,14,Sun Jul 5 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"Well if they are fairly open minded then it shouldn't be a problem. Just a few things which might be helpful since I've seen things like this happen :   1) No handshakes or hugs with the female cousins. No matter how open minded they are, if you do that...those family aunties will start talking.  2) If you've converted, then I doubt you would be drinking alcohol, but if not, stay away from it when they are there. But if they drink too, then no problem.  3) Does the rest of the family (aunts, uncles etc) know about your live-in situation? if not...then don't bring it up and don't tell them you live there before marriage.  4) Be prepared for lots of questions about your family, job, how much money you make etc. There's no way around it. Just answer them with as much patience as you can...because everybody will ask those questions.  that's all that I can think of right now. Hope it helps. Cheers."

Last time I was there they sat me down (mom along with her sister) to tell that basically my plans weren't cutting it and that I had to get my shit together. I have since then (a bit I guess) but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm most apprehensive about getting cornered like again, but like you said, it's probably inevitable.   I've dated people from a lot of different cultures and their parents were generally happy that their daughter wasn't with some who was completely fucking up. Her family seems to want someone who's really well-off.   Also, thanks for the tip on hugs and handshakes. I'll keep that in mind."
pakistan,3c6ikf,rahmad,5,Sun Jul 5 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"btw, the classic hug move with aunties (if an auntie opens and raises her arms like she's intending to hug you). rotate to be about 3/4 away from you and lower yourself and droop your arms. this allows the auntie to embrace you kind of sideways (sort of like a more wrapped around pat on the back), while you just sort of meekly take it.  classic pakistani male move when dealing with an older auntie."

I have a couple of non-Pakistanis in my extended family and the most lasting impression comes from whether they speak to everyone or not. Try to be charming. The aunts will love you if you can make them laugh  3) Come up with answers for the personal questions before hand. Try not to make them detailed because they will ask you the same questions every time. It's better to be vague than to tell them everything and have to change it the next time you see them  4) Know what food you're going to eat and how to eat it.

I do not think it is economically productive for these people to be wiping the asses of the rich, the same way it is a waste of resources for an economy to specialise in the provision of luxury goods, what good do Rolex watches and diamond rings provide to society at large?

Sure it looks good on paper, 100,000 people employed in fine dining for instance, but historically these measures have been harbringers of economic peril.

Doesn't mean there aren't rich people in Japan, but most people are educated to some degree and earn a decent income.   The Japanese are an isolated and ethnically homogenous nation, they are most certainly xenophobic to outsiders, but there are very few outsiders settled in Japan as a result of their closed-border policies. I don't know why you raised this point though as it is unrelated to domestic elitism  In the case of Japan you are confusing xenophobia with elitism, which are two different things.  While there are class divisions in Beijing, the idea that there is an underclass living in a sister city that is unwelcome in the richer city next-door is still unheard of.

Here is a news report on this from fucking 2003.  Here is a mainstream movie made with Ikhwan at the center of the movie.   The film depicts the Ikhwan, a counterinsurgency force compising mainly militants, who were armed and funded by the Indian security forces. Peer writes in the book: “They tortured and killed like modern-day Mongols. The Ikhwan … went on a rampage, killing, maiming and harassing anyone they thought to be sympathetic to the Jamaat [the Jamaat-e-Islami, a religious body supportive of Pakistan] or the separatists.” That essentially a death squad of ex militants were armed by the Indian army and let loose on the populace is a galling fact of the conflict that many Indians choose to ignore.   Here is an even more nuanced article on this counter militia.  Ikhwan were very critical to clearing the valley of Hizb-ul-mujahideen, and EVERYONE knows this.  Here is something about Kuka Parray the leader of Ikhwan.   I have no moral compunctions in India hiring these militia to fight specifically the HuM, LeT and their ilk.

It's not sensationalist when the writer of the article couldn't care less what sort of other articles were posted on an obscure subreddit.

That retarded frat game is called ""Limp Biscuit""... which kind of indirectly explains why the band of the same namesake is so fucking horrible.    What the shit is that?

There has been peace in the valley for nearly a decade now, and it has held in no small part thanks to moves like this.   The only realistic, long term (non-war) solution is to model a peace process on Northern Ireland.  If J&K is to be kept together, there needs to be a fixed power sharing agreement between the nationalists of Jammu and Ladakh, and the seperatists of the Valley. Otherwise, Jammu and Ladakh should be fully integrated into India (as states or UTs) while G-B is given constitutional status by Pakistan, and both parts of the Kashmir valley are given cross-border autonomy by their countries."

There are two ways I think they can be brought into the net:   Make large cash transactions difficult by removing the 5000 rupee notes introduced by Mushi. Make bank accounts mandatory for all citizens and educate the citizens to ask for debit/credit card payments instead of cash. If cash must be used, always use receipts.

Lets see here. India recieved 3.2 billion dollars in aid while Pakistan recieved 3.5 billion dollars in aid. Keep in mind, most of this aid is going to the war on the Af Pak border; a war which America brought along with it back in 01.  India on the other hand was fighting absolutely no war and was still getting aid because it was a slum shit and a slum shit hole only.  So just to sum it for your tiny little mind, Pakistan's getting money by America to fight an American war. On the other hand, India's getting the same amount of money just for being India. Nice.    Try again, and carry us a pail of water as well please... oh I forgot, you might not have the resources to do that :)   Careful, your RSS is showing. Lets not forget that India's poverty rate is still way higher than Pakistan even after Pakistan got done fighting a 5 year old foreign war. How pathetic.. Here's another source if you'd like that shows how India even has a higher poverty rate than Iraq and Ethiopia. It seems to me that you're in that set of esteemed nations my friend :)   Aside from this,Pakistan's also one of the most racially tolerant countries while India is one of the least tolerant. Again, even here your country is on par with Iraq. LOL so much for ""secularism"".  I'm fairly certain the unemployment rate in India is higher too; just look at yourself for example. Only a complete jobless nut would go on another country's thread and shitpost on it. No seriously, re-evaluate your life for a second. How are you so jobless that you're on a Pakistani forum shitposting against Pakistan?  LOL, such a sad life .  I must add though, you're doing a heavy disservice to your country. If I hadn't met some pretty chill Indians in my life, I'd think all of India was filled with nutters like you. Nevertheless, if you're a sane person, your arguments should end here now :) While both countries have their fair share of problems, you've got cold hard facts shoved in your face proving how India's the one that needs that pail of water more than Pakistan. But alas, you're an  Indian troll and you'll continue to masturbate to your glorious Hindu motherland and deny facts.

Also, I doubt that either country would or should allow independence as an option. Even the UN stated that it's one country or the other.  I personally think the most sensible solution is one where no land changes hands. India is an aspirant superpower and no country of it's size, importance or military strength has ever voluntarily ceded land, and it seems highly unlikely that India will do so. At the same time, it seems unlikely that you guys will ever let go of AJK or G-B either.

pakistan,3c2rju,thisismymanhood,4,Sun Jul 5 06:02:39 2015 UTC,"First of all. Welcome to the subreddit, Israeli friend. I would like to first acknowledge that I wish Pakistan recognizes Israel and establishes diplomatic ties, as this is probably the sanest thing to do, considering the Arabs have never spoken a word for Pakistan's Kashmir dispute.  The BBC offers scenarios of possible solutions to the conflict: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/default.stm  I am of Kashmiri heritage.  The Kashmiris are a muslim majority nation, and are only in India because of Maharaja Hari Singh's (a hindu) decision to join India, with complete disregard to the views of the Muslim masses living in his state, who wanted to join Pakistan. India's PM at the time, Nehru, promised the Kashmiris that their right of self-determination will be met, and ""India is not fond of forced marriages"".  Unfortunately, that promise was not kept.  Let me assure you, most Kashmiris today either desire independence or to join Pakistan - and they do not want to join India.  And they do not want the LoC to remain a border between their nation.  An internationally-monitored referendum should be held in Kashmir, with 3 choices: 1. Independence from both nations.  2. Join Pak.  3. Join India.  India will never allow this because Kashmiris will most likely opt for independence or merger with Pakistan.  Merger with India WILL NOT happen.  I assure you. So I will discuss only 2 scenarios that are most likely to happen.  Scenario 1: Independence.   Kashmiris from Pakistan and India unite to form a nation.  Their flag will be very similar to Pakistan, and their national language will be Urdu, just like Pakistan (most Kashmiris are Urdu speakers).

pakistan,3c2rju,Paranoid__Android,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:06:30 2015 UTC,"First of all. Welcome to the subreddit, Israeli friend. I would like to first acknowledge that I wish Pakistan recognizes Israel and establishes diplomatic ties, as this is probably the sanest thing to do, considering the Arabs have never spoken a word for Pakistan's Kashmir dispute.   Great to hear! :) Also, for the record, one can recognize Israel without supporting all of Israel's policies.   The BBC offers scenarios of possible solutions to the conflict: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/default.stm   Yes, I saw that BBC page before. :)   I am of Kashmiri heritage.   OK.   The Kashmiris are a muslim majority nation, and are only in India because of Maharaja Hari Singh's (a hindu) decision to join India, with complete disregard to the views of the Muslim masses living in his state, who wanted to join Pakistan.   As far as I know, though, Hari Singh only chose to join India due to the fact that Pashtun forces from Pakistan had already invaded Kashmir by that point in time.   India's PM at the time, Nehru, promised the Kashmiris that their right of self-determination will be met, and ""India is not fond of forced marriages"". Unfortunately, that promise was not kept.   Well, if Pakistan would have been willing to withdraw all of its troops from Kashmir in the late 1940s and/or in the early 1950s, then maybe a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite would have occurred in Kashmir.   Let me assure you, most Kashmiris today either desire independence or to join Pakistan - and they do not want to join India. And they do not want the LoC to remain a border between their nation.   Well, at the very least, I will say that a majority of the people in the Kashmir Valley almost certainly prefer independence.   An internationally-monitored referendum should be held in Kashmir, with 3 choices: 1. Independence from both nations. 2. Join Pak. 3. Join India.   That would have been great, especially back in 1947 before the British left.  However, it might be both too late and a bad move to hold such a referendum in Kashmir right now:  http://www.rediff.com/news/report/eu/20070306.htm   India will never allow this because Kashmiris will most likely opt for independence or merger with Pakistan. Merger with India WILL NOT happen. I assure you. So I will discuss only 2 scenarios that are most likely to happen.   Well, there is also the matter that, as far as I know, any territorial changes to India require an amendment to the Indian Constitution.   Scenario 1: Independence. Kashmiris from Pakistan and India unite to form a nation. Their flag will be very similar to Pakistan, and their national language will be Urdu, just like Pakistan (most Kashmiris are Urdu speakers). They will form a state very similar to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Over the course of decades and centuries, eventually this landlocked nation will join very close ties with its more culturally-close and religiously native neighbour, Pakistan. They will be so interlinked, that I can predict that within a 100 years of Kashmiri independence there will be a merger with Pakistan or form a very very close relationship, a defensive or economic union.   Good luck getting India to agree to this, though.   Scenario 2: Pakistan merger. Personally, I want this to occur. But I would like Jammu to stay with India since they are majority Hindu and don't want to merge with Pakistan. If this scenario is to occur, it should be everything north of River Chenab to join Pakistan, and below to join India.   I don't think that the people in either the Kashmir Valley or Ladakh (which I think is Buddhist-majority) want to join Pakistan, though. Heck, the people in Ladakh might prefer Indian rule instead.  Also, for the record, my solution here isn't meant to be fair. Rather, it is meant to be realistic. If there is a way to restore the 1947 demographic situation in all of Kashmir, then maybe, just maybe a plebiscite should occur. However, I am unsure if this is possible to do; after all, how good was record-keeping in Kashmir back in 1947?"

I am not going to debate on any justifications - I am sure India had justifications: all I am saying is Pakistan also had their justifications which were valid and real.  In Kashmir, Pakistanis were not going to let Hari Singh decide the fate of a people that supported the Pakistani movement. Pakistani pashtun tribes invaded Kashmir,and  there was unrest and uprising in Poonch.  And the tribals got a lot of support from them, and also in Gilgit, Skardu, etc.  If India had a right to annex Hyderabad, so did Pakistan have a right to annex Kashmir as it is a Muslim-majority nation that culturally identifies with the other 4 provinces and Afghanistan for centuries.

Countless Hindu women became victims of rape and kidnapping by Razakars. Thousands went to jail and braved the cruelties perpetuated by the oppressive administration. Due to the activities of the Razakars, thousands of Hindus had to flee from the state and take shelter in various camps. An official estimate is hard to come by, but tens of thousands of Hindus and progressive Muslims are thought to have been killed. The state unit of the Indian National Congress was banned and its leaders forced to flee to Vijaywada or Bombay. The Communist Party of India also became active in defending the general population from the Muslim Razakar militia.""           Where as the Hindu king of Kashmir did no such thing, he wanted to be independent until the state was attacked by Pakistan. ""Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to Mountbatten for assistance, and the governor-general agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state.""

As well, since you've essentially said it's impossible to do and not going to happen, and therefore shouldn't happen in Palestine, do you then still oppose a referendum in Kashmir? Seeing as the refugees aren't going to return, why shouldn't they just have a referendum with people who are there?   Ah ... I see where exactly you are going with this. Anyway, I will say this--your position on this is certainly not an invalid one. In fact, I am no longer going to outright argue against it. However, if I was an Indian, then I would refuse to agree to a referendum in Kashmir until all of the areas in Kashmir will become Hindu-majority (this might be accomplished by allowing Hindus from other parts of India to buy land in Kashmir, et cetera).

Basically, there are 2 possibilities:   You support separation because you believe somehow professing belief in Islam gives the muslims the right to have a new country. If this were the case, most Indians wouldn't agree with you because they see their country as secular and will point to a huge population of Muslims within the country. You support the right to self-determination of people. This is not an incorrect position to take. But countries don't quite work this way. For instance, a movement for independence in Balochistan might be popular (and even more legitimate given it's based on ethnic lines), but do you think Pakistan is going to agree to the separation voluntarily?   That really only leaves the realpolitik option. Basically, if Kashmir were to separate, it would set off a shitstorm in India destabilizing the whole country. So, I don't really see this as a possibility. So, I guess retaining borders with population exchange would be an option. Another would be territorial exchanges so that a major portion of Kashmir valley goes to Pakistan in exchange for territory elsewhere. That would ensure there's a cost to the separation and wouldn't destabilize India significantly"
pakistan,3c2rju,razpor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"i don't think u read or understood my message properly.  i listed 2 possibilities. if u don't subscribe to option 1, that's fine.  regarding option 2, that's not an illogical position at all. it's just that it's rather naive. you cannot possibly assume that everyone in a country want to be a part of that country at a given time. so tomorrow, some other problem will crop up and another part of the country may want to break away. you think they should immediately get the vote? if countries run that way, countries wouldn't really exist.  a whole fuckton of countries, both in ancient past, and in the present have had separatist issues. the thing is, a country defends its own interests and its integrity. if separatists want to separate, they are gonna have to earn it.  i am someone who wouldn't have really cared if kashmir went to pakistan right at the beginning. but because it is with india now, it cannot just separate without a cost cos that will destabilize the whole country.   which is why i think territorial exchange (eg. parts of Sindh or GB) in exchange for parts of Kashmir valley so that the J&K state becomes Hindu/Sikh majority on the whole might be the best option.   another option which is even easier is to make LOC the border."
pakistan,3c2rju,razpor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"My point is simple. Kashmir, like any nation, deserves the right to choose independence from both countries or merger with both. They should be given a choice under UN.    The Kashmiri conflict began not just due to the Pashtun tribe invasion, but also due to Muslim rebellion/uprising against Hari Singh in Poonch. There is an interesting read on this ""Kashmir: The unwritten story"" by Christopher Snnedden. An Australian historian regarding the Poonch rebellion before the Pashtuns showed up.   Let's not forget the Gilgit scouts in the 1947-48 war, they comprised of people in Gilgit-Baltistan who basically pushed back the Indians from Gilgit, Skadu and went further into Kargil only to be halted and driven back by Indian forces in a counter offense to the LoC.  Anyhow, Kashmiris deserve their right for self-determination. Whether they choose to be free from both India and Pakistan is no one else's business. Period.  Let's not forget that the idea of Pakistan was all Muslim majority states forming into a unit.  And Pakistan was alarmed when Hari Singh was delaying his response, and adding to that the Poonch revolt.  A very similar example of Kashmir is the former Princely State of Hyderabad, that had Hindu majority but a Muslim ruler (Nizam of Hyderabad). India INVADED the state (read about Operation Polo) and forced it to yield."

This fall in terrorist incidents in KPK is a result of terrorist strongholds in FATA being destroyed. Had Imran Khan had his way we would still be involved in 'talks and negotiations' with the enemy and their power would have continued to grow.  I remember very well that IK was insisting that a military operation would result in more terrorist incidents and deaths until the army formally launched Zarb-e-Azb and all th politicians realised that now the army was having its way whether they liked it or not.  He then gave a statement that now that our army is engaged in an operation we have to support them and that the operation was necessary because Nawaz Sharif and the federal government screwed up the negotiations.

Young men would disappear on slightest suspicion,  bus load of Hindu pilgrims would be gunned down.   And the common population suffered. Why do you think the ratio of Kashmir born fighters to foreign fighters went from 80-20 in 1990 to 35-65 by late 90's? The fight was beaten out the local population and only the Arab/Afghan/Pok(azad k) fighters kept fighting into the 2000's till Pervez Ahab pulled even their support."
pakistan,3bxoz5,supamonkey77,6,Fri Jul 3 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Stop trying to change the topic.  The reality is straightforward. The initial violence started in 1987 and it was a KASHMIRI uprising to Indian rule. Kashmiris started it, whoever supported it is irrelevant.   You don't hear Pakistani forces gunning down people in Azad Kashmir.  Or hunger strikes in Pakistan Kashmir, or curfews in Pakistan Kashmir.  And Kashmir is a hot topic again since there are curfews and protests going on in IOK.  Thanks.    A Kashmiri"
pakistan,3bxoz5,supamonkey77,8,Fri Jul 3 01:17:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying the fact that the initial uprising was home grown. Neither am I denying that whom ever supported it, the first generation of fighters were largely of IOK origin.   What I am saying is that, the Indian forces were brutal to the population, sweeping the innocent and the not so innocent with a single club. What I am saying is that the Kashmiri militants were also brutal in their attacks on the civilians. Are you saying all this didn't happen?  But what I'm also saying is that, its shouldn't be new news to anyone. All sides agree to those facts. So what change am I trying to make?   I'll also say that, Yes there was very little accountability of the armed forces and India as a state should not have resorted to tit for tat brutality (in some cases even surpassing) shown by the militants.  Is the fact that I am, not just talking about the actions of the armed forces but also of the militants the problem?  I'll also say that, if the people of Kashmir have grievances that  are still not heard, they might again try to take the same path, but this time it might even be worse because there is will be even less international support. India is not a paragon of virtue, its a modern state with national and international interests. Should India have been more diplomatic and less barbarous in its approach, absolutely. Should I feel empathy for the innocent lives lost, yes. Should India make sure IOK remains part of India under any circumstance and baring diplomatic means through violence, Absolutely.  Is it hypocritical, absolutely. Is it the right choice for India, absolutely.   The only solution I see is for parties that are pro independence, to instead of boycotting  elections, win majority, create a government and then tell the center ""We have the people's mandate, lets talk independence or at least an increased level of autonomy than is presently given to Kashmir via the Indian constitution.""  Seems reasonable to me."
pakistan,3bxoz5,supamonkey77,5,Fri Jul 3 02:09:03 2015 UTC,"You are right in that the Kashmiri seperatists should participate in elections just like Mujib-ur-Rahman did in '71 for East Pakistan.  However, you are wrong to state that parties recognize the atrocities. The Indian media and government deny allegations of Indian atrocities, which are far more widespread than the atrocities committed by the militants.  Right now the violence has diminished because the Kashmiri generation have realized that the best way forward is a political settlement, unlike the previous one. However, the next generation may revert back to a violent method yet again.  Let's hope it doesn't come to that and Hurriyat parties and separatists play smart"
pakistan,3bxoz5,Paranoid__Android,3,Fri Jul 3 02:54:34 2015 UTC,"I feel that you are also using the club when you generalize ""The Indian media and government deny allegations of Indian atrocities,""  If not completely in the 90's due to media blackouts, there have been reports and investigations by both the media and Government( although admittedly the Government reports might have kept more secrets). But of course the Indian media would be biased and have a slight ""agenda"" following the government line, but to say that there wasn't even a peep is wrong.   Just a cursory google search reveals  Military kills more civis than militants  Indian authors, somewhat sympathetic to the cause of the Kashmiri youth  Dismal record of military being found guilty  conspiracy of abduction of everyday citizens  Army influencing the elected officials   Also, yes the Militant brutality was targeted at a smaller population and as I said before, the military was a club that brutalized a larger population. The military(all militaries) is not a surgeon, its a butcher.  But as to the individual acts of brutality, you can have differing opinion on how it affected people."

Says who?   violence has diminished because the Kashmiri generation have realized that the best way forward is a political settlement unlike the previous one. there are only so many fidayeen attacks that you can do on a country of a billion people. You will run out before they will. They also know that Pakistan just has Kashmir as an instrument to needle India. Nothing more, nothing less. They also realize that they fucked the Hindus so bad, that now NO ONE gives a shit about them.    FTFY   However, the next generation may revert back to a violent method yet again.    Sure - India is shaking like a leaf with veiled threats like these. A violent method to what end? You think India will ever move away from Kashmir?

Suddenly your drunken bragging is very relevant.    This is the video that was shown at the election hearings today.  Najam Sethi is very clearly saying that on the eve of the elections, he ceded control of the election apparatus to ""Raiwind and Modle Town""  Hamid Mir asked IK why he showed this video and not the 35 punctures quote.

Sethi was talking about the time when the results had been out unofficially through reporters and party workers at polling stations, but before the results were officially announced. When we all, as well as the bureaucrats knew who was going to win, they stopped reporting to him. Thats not a conspiracy. You think he is that stupid to brag about it on national television?   That 35 puncture phone call was more believable, that's why PTI stuck to that. This video thing was just PTI desperately looking for anything to accuse Sethi of, because they had no proof of the puncture allegation."

pakistan,3burd9,Cicerotulli,10,Fri Jul 3 22:57:18 2015 UTC,"Just because I love you: Here is a really long TL;DR    Design level flaws in Pakistani formation. Made by ex-nawabs who saw the writing on the wall pertaining to their power Some personal reasons for various personalities to form Pakistan Complications around linguistic / cultural subjugation Frustrations with lionizing Arabs that actually destroyed Lahore and Peshawar and ignoring the moderate Muslims (Dara Shikoh) Frustration about looking to the Arabistan for inspiration when they are 22 countries who cannot get together, and not towards India that has 26 old kingdoms staying together bound by a solid constitution Wiping clean Kashmiri language from PoK [this part was new to me, I thought Pakistani Kashmiris spoke ...well..Kashmiri. The anchor seemed to Kashmiri and he agreed], and gifting large part of Kashmir to Chinese who have NO claim there  Argues (I never thought of it this way) that even India has had strain post independence, but they kept breaking up into smaller states, and that made the country much better.    So, despite making good points, the dude talks like a smug scumbag with a high degree of detachment towards Pakistan (as almost an academic discussion). His points are actually not too different than Hasan Nisar and the PCB chairman dude, but they approach it with a bit more ""belonging"" so seem more tolerable.  However, I did not mean to bash up Pakistan, but was more looking for sensible /r/Pakistanis to eviscerate his arguments and facts. Or may be link to some arguments from sensible / smart commentators (not Army men and ISI) who refute his points."
pakistan,3burd9,Cicerotulli,3,Fri Jul 3 23:33:08 2015 UTC,"Design level flaws in Pakistani formation. Made by ex-nawabs who saw the writing on the wall pertaining to their power Some personal reasons for various personalities to form Pakistan   A learned historian can answer you better in this regard. Yaser Latif Hamdani is expert in this field but unfortunately he's not on reddit.    Complications around linguistic / cultural subjugation   I am from 'muhajir' community and i have never found any subjugation of my culture from anywhere (this is from my personal experience). The only other place i have visited in Pk is Punjab and i did find it odd that not many people there speak Punjabi (or atleast openly)   Frustrations with lionizing Arabs that actually destroyed Lahore and Peshawar and ignoring the moderate Muslims    This i can agree with 100%. Need to go back to our sufi roots.    Frustration about looking to the Arabistan for inspiration when they are 22 countries who cannot get together, and not towards India that has 26 old kingdoms staying together bound by a solid constitution   While what he says makes sense but he's wrong when he says that Arab nations are not together. Yes they do have borders (purely for personal gains) but most of the Arabs are pan-arabists and they only consider Arabs to be their brothers and noone else. They have free visa entries for Arab nations, preference for other Arabs for jobs etc etc. I have visited alot of Arab countries and i only found Iraqi, Morocco and Algerian dialect to be a bit different.    Wiping clean Kashmiri language from PoK [this part was new to me, I thought Pakistani Kashmiris spoke ...well..Kashmiri. The anchor seemed to Kashmiri and he agreed], and gifting large part of Kashmir to Chinese who have NO claim there   I have no idea about this. TIL.   Argues (I never thought of it this way) that even India has had strain post independence, but they kept breaking up into smaller states, and that made the country much better.   100% right.    His points are actually not too different than Hasan Nisar and the PCB chairman dude   Hasan Nisar and Najam Sethi are very influential figures, hence, why we look upto them. They are also patriots so whatever they say holds some merit, whereas for Tarek Fatah, he has this spite for our country that just makes me not watch or take his words seriously. Most of the Pakistanis don't even know about Tarek Fatah"
pakistan,3burd9,greenvox,4,Sat Jul 4 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"This is retarded. Pakistani Kashmiris do speak Kashmiri. Last time I checked, PTV has a Kashmiri khabarnama as well. This is the problem with Fatah in particular and other trolls in general. They weave lies and personal agendas so well into facts that it becomes a whole process to separate bullshit from something worthwhile. You're better off listening to an academic than someone like this guy. He is comparable to someone like Lickman, just on the other side of the spectrum. Their followers don't deserve respect.  Sethi is a saint. No fucking comparison with Nisar. Fatah is not even relevant."

pakistan,3burd9,boomaya,2,Thu Jul 2 10:06:32 2015 UTC,"I am not a PTI fan. I am an ex-PTI pro-bono ""technical consultant"". I worked closely with the PTI leadership in US in the early to mid-2000s when PTI was not as dear to Imran Khan. We setup his Twitter, Facebook, FARA accounts, fundraisers, and got him the $38,000 per month direct deposit donations PTI sees every month. We idealized a platform of no nonsense growth, religious inclusion, and the end of family dynasties, and up until two years ago, that's what PTI was. So we are the sidelined oldies, as compared to the PPP and JI inductees.  The fact is that the people coming into PTI are representative of the Pakistani population. You are not going to get geo-literate, tolerant, and progressive candidate from Sanghar, Sindh. Even if you did, no one is going to vote for him because he would be a zani, kafir, Qadiani, CIA agent. So what can we do? As Imran says, education is the only solution to this problem... so as a sidelined oldie, I'll him have the benefit of the doubt.  To clearly answer your question of how do I reconcile Hasan Nisar's hatred of JI with my support of PTI which considers JI tied to it's hip: I don't. I see it as a marriage of necessity. PTI can't make a government in KPK without JI. JI and PPP is definitely polluting PTI and I am not blind to that."

But you have been seriously misled into believing progressive people don't exist in every part of Pakistan, and that the demand for these people doesn't exist. Khursheed Shah is from Sukkhur. Bhutto and even BB picked out some excellent people and they were voted in by the population. The problem is that IK is no Bhutto or BB. He is simply not intelligent enough to be capable of forming his own brand that attracts voters and good candidates. Our Punjabi upper middle class who supports PTI is not large enough to be politically relevant. He has only come along so far because of lotas, some of whom were persuaded to join him by farishtas. Don't just accept his bs story of how he can't do it without lotas, demand that he do it, and if you also think he is incapable, get rid of him and try to build the party without him.

pakistan,3burd9,hexag1,2,Thu Jul 2 10:13:00 2015 UTC,"Kashmiri and it's closely related Shina are widely spoken in Pakistan. The foundation of Pakistan was laid in Dhaka in 1906. It was organized by Bengalis and presided mostly by their Nawabs. Bengal itself partitioned in 1909 along religious lines. Shaikh Mujeeb-ur-Rehman was the chief organizer of the Direct Action Day. On the other hand, Punjab was harmoniously integrated all the way up till August 14th, 1947 and KPK didn't even want to secede up until the end. So technically speaking, Pakistan is the dream of a people who abandoned it in 1971. We do have linguistic complications because of a bad decision. English, instead of Urdu should have been the only official language. We are justified in tracing our history in India, Iran and Arabia. Balochis, Pukhtoon, Makranis, Brahuis, and Baltis have nothing to do with India. They are better served when relating themselves with Afghanistan, Iran and the Arabs. Punjabis always identify themselves with Punjab and their lineage is mostly dependent on their zaat. Awans are descendents of Arabs. Rajputs like me are natives. There is nothing wrong with identifying yourself correctly. You will never see a Sindhi identify with the Arabs. We are completely aware of Dara Shikoh and no one derides him. The mere fact is that he lost to Jehangir, and history is kinder to the victors. Pakistanis love their ""moderate"" Muslims like Abdullah Shah, Shah Hussain, Amir Khusrau etc. We even like  We don't look at Arabistan for inspiration any more than Indians do. Dubai is the same to Indians as it is to Pakistanis. Money talks. Pakistani provinces never broke because Pakistan was founded with massive provincial and princely autonomy. Then it went to 2 units, then 1 unit, and then finally 4 provinces and 3 federal areas. Pakistani provinces are hard to break because people relate more closely to their province than their country. You break one province and the natives want secession. It's crazy."

pakistan,3btfyy,guyfrompakistan,0,Thu Jul 2 13:30:57 2015 UTC,"I really disagree with the tone of this article, particularly the marquee project they begin with.  First, a LOT of these projects were started during the previous regime, so I think it inappropriate to laud NS for this.  Furthermore, I can't speak for many of these infrastructure projects, but they sound like vanity projects to me (like the metro).    But I think the Bahria town thing is a disaster.  It has inconvenienced many many people, the roads leading up to the area (even after the massive bridge building that really inconveniened people) can't handle the traffic density associated with the building, our power lines can't handle it, and neither can our water supply.  If you want to engage in these marquee, iconic projects, first be sure that there is adequate support infrastructure there.  Judging by karachi's layout, this buidling should be built elsewhere, on Shah Faisla on I I Chundigar, where it can be accomodated.  But again, this is very short sighted and naive...assuming big buildings mean progress.  I mean they do, but in the long run they cause a lot of problems."

Two, I'm sorry you've written paragraphs upon paragraphs, but who the heck are you to judge me?  Do you even know why I'm against it...not for any of the reasons you've mentioned.  Its...absolutely facile for you to draw utterly baseless conclusions; this holier than thou attitude really irks me.  Two factors that I've spent ""paragraphs upon paragraphs"" talking about.  1.) I've willingly conceded I haven't experienced the bus services first hand and am always willing to entertain the possibility that I'm missing something.  Also, I don't live in Islamabad or Lahore, so I can't aruge with the limitations in those cities that perhaps forced them to adopt the current design. 2.) I've always championed public transit projects...in fact I argue the converse causality that most people assume: strong transportation infrastructure leads to high GDP.  But the fact remains that I think the metro, as it has been implemented is a poor implementation and all those funds could have been appropriated for a much better, more efficient, transit network.    That's my criticism of the metro: I believe that money could have been better used to create a more efficient, public friendly, transportation network.  As it stands, I do believe that it is a vanity project due to it requiring minimal expertise and turn around time (so it was ready for the 2013 elections)."
