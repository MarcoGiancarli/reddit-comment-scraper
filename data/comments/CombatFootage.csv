It doesn't take much to teach people how to properly shoot a rifle, how to burst  effectively with a machine gun, etc. They get trained the same way most other developed nations get trained. You won't see much difference in the way German, Norway, Dutch or American infantry operate. The tactics have all been studied and agreed upon which are the best between Nato members. All you need is a few weeks training on how to properly shoot, how to operate as an infantry soldier and that's it, you have a pretty decent unit to operate. I hate to rain on your parade but it's not rocket science, Canadians are nothing special."

There had been a previous attack which had the crowd on edge, these soldiers lost their way while driving, they were pulled out of their car, stripped, beaten and murdered. Both were armed and apart from a warning shot did not fire at the crowd. They were murdered for being in a uniform no other reason."

Often these videos were from Youtube channels belonging to American and Canadian veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. Though recently they've started to give credit to the original sources, but that too isn't a common occurrence.  Sometimes, they used to take videos off the ones posted here, upload them on their own channels and then repost it over here a week later. Some of the older users here strongly despise Funker530 (check older posts as to why this is the case), WarLeaks, and other channels. They're known for spreading lots of misinformation as per their titles. Many of the regulars here refuse to post their videos on here which is why you don't see as many Funker, WarLeaks, etc. videos on here.  We don't have a particular ban on any channel, but we use personal discretion and sometimes we will remove links and/or ban users if we think they keep using the same source and are suspected of using this subreddit for their own personal profit.  Personally, I feel very uncomfortable at the idea of profiteering at the suffering and destruction of other people's homes and lives, but that's just a personal thought of mine. He and others are welcomed to think differently, which is why the mod team here do what we do on a voluntary basis.   I don't have a problem with people using the clips from /r/CombatFootage mostly because we are hosting other people's footage as well and thus we can't take credit for the works of others. In fact, we've had journalists and other analysts use our sub and the discussions on here, and we're completely okay with that as well.  Edit: Grammar"
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,khaeen,34,Mon Jul 20 20:11:06 2015 UTC,I like the low intensity mod atmosphere here. I agree with your points and I would like to think that some of the major reasons we don't constantly see videos from those types of channels are because they do indeed spread misinformation and that the community here also naturally stays away from them because they never seem to do the source videos justice.

However, he constantly tags old videos as new and uploads them to get money, he constantly mistags his videos so people watching don't know who's fighting or where. He's not doing this because he's incompetent, but because he wants money and is willing to spread misinformation if it means he gets it.  Personally, I don't like anybody that will watermark combat footage. I hate seeing openings of videos pointing to someone who's making money off other people's battles. I didn't even like LiveLeak watermarks, let alone a youtube channel one.   I'd welcome the banning of his channel and similar channels like warleaks that spread misinformation for profit. I don't really get mad when I see their videos, but I usually try to find the source, because I actually want to know who's fighting who, and when they fought, and where, and why, and how. Not just the combat itself."

He probably didn't even care about the profiting off of his video so much as he was pissed that people were mistaking him and his buddies for Marines.    EDIT: Funker's post of the video in question.  He's since edited the title to be less descriptive.

There's a little niggle in the back of my mind thinking, you know, hey it's a little weird he's making money off -- basically -- other peoples' content but at the same time, people often send him the content personally for him to upload and he has branched out to do so much more now with all the Funker Tactical stuff.  It's a business for him. And his transition from LL to his own little site on the side to YT and then back to his own site again has been painless because, for the most part, he's done the same thing forever. And there's no denying that if you want quality footage, you know Funker's going to have it."
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,tinkthank,4,Tue Jul 21 05:46:14 2015 UTC,"My major point of contention against his website and many other channels like his is the spread of misinformation. He and many other sites have resubmitted old videos, changing the title and further spreading false stories to a population of people who may not be exposed to combat footage on a regular basis and/or  don't understand the context of the videos and take it at face value. All for purposes of profiteering and attracting more viewership.   I don't agree with making money off Combat Footage, but that's just my opinion, but in my mind, its all kinds of wrong when you purposefully mislead a population. Now, I'd understand making mistakes from time to time, but there's a point where you have to stop and wonder if they really are capable of consistently making these mistakes over and over again when there are multiple sources available to corroborate relevant and fairly accurate information. If you don't know, then you don't know, be honest to your userbase at the very least.  As far as Funker is concerned, he tries to drive a particular political message with his videos. I understand that he wants to share his views and thats his perogative and that of other Combat Youtube Channels, but to do so by tampering with information is pretty wrong in my book.   As for this subreddit, we try to maintain political objectivity here in this to foster proper discussions. Which is why we remove politically charged and vague terms like ""terrorists/terrorism"", ""freedom fighters"", etc. If your submission title is politically charged, it gets removed. That's how I personally think it should be and I know the mods of this sub also stand by that principle."

This was a particular problem with Funker during the ISIS siege of Kobane where he did absolutely zero fact checking to make sure that the footage he was titling ""tank battle in Kobane"" (to use one of the more egregious example) was actually from Kobane and not somewhere else."
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,lordfuzzywig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:57:54 2015 UTC,"Total agreement. I think the only way I could get behind it is if the profit (or even a portion of the profits) went to charity.  On my YT channel, for example, 30% of all donations/revenue/etc. go to Wounded Warrior. Granted, so far, that's only like 1 dollar. But it's something. I don't know why Funker doesn't do that. But like I said, I also don't keep up on him. If he's doing what he is accused of, that's kind of rephrensible.  Keeping politically charged nonsense out of what is, for all intents and purposes, documented experiences is so important. That's why this sub is a daily visit for me. It's very neutral, and I love that."
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,binkin,2,Tue Jul 21 08:06:48 2015 UTC,Funker Tactical isnt part of Funker anymore he said this on his channel.
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,lordfuzzywig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:51:55 2015 UTC,Sure enough. That's news to me. I don't keep up much on him since he moved from LL/prosites. I occasionally would watch a video or two. I prefer a number of other channels for gear/tactics discussion. Thanks for the information!
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,binkin,3,Tue Jul 21 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"I think he selled the company in 2014.   From the channel description: ""Notice: FUNKER530 is no longer associated with ""Funker Tactical Media Inc."" as of July 2014.""  You cant sell YouTube channels as such after YouTube dont allows this but I think you can simply make a small company based on the channel and sell the company as such. Is just my conclusion dont know if it was that way but possible."
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,smileyman,2,Tue Jul 21 07:01:23 2015 UTC,"The only channel I subscribe to that does this is adri12345, and that's because he actually performs a useful service by taking a bunch of short clips from different sources of a particular battle and editing them together to form a single long clip.   That's a useful service in my opinion. So many of these others just take old footage and rehost it without acknowledgement or doing basic fact checking."
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,tinkthank,2,Tue Jul 21 08:00:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point about adri12345 and I also have some respect for Stahgewitter Syrien's videos and channels.   I'm not sure if they profit from their channels. People here are mentioning that YT had banned profiting from Combat footage, and I'm inclined to believe that, so they translate some of the videos or get it translated, provide fairly accurate information, and at times even redirect to the original link. I can respect that."

CombatFootage,3dzfwx,RollingRuedo,22,Mon Jul 20 23:16:58 2015 UTC,"He is a habitual offender of this. He has also made numerous alt accounts which have been shadowbanned as a result. I personally don't have a problem with someone who uses content from this sub (as /u/tinkthank alluded to that others do), but to present footage in a misleading manner is wrong.   /u/PurpleOlive can shed more light on this if he feels the need to but I think I summed it up. The way he goes about it is wrong."
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,binkin,5,Tue Jul 21 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I unsubbed from him a month after I subbed. Too many bullshit titles and his annoying watermarks killed it for me. The only good combat footage channel I know of is Stahlgewitter Syrien, who is pretty good about avoiding bias/BS titles. Only problem is he only posts stuff from the middle east."
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,finderzkeepers,5,Tue Jul 21 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"Oh most stuff Funker has is not that exclusive. He simply used a mix of public domain footage and videos from veterans who uploaded one or two videos to their own channels.   Sometimes there were permission requests and I think sometimes he just took the footage from the original channels and the people  were actually glad their stuff was gaining attention.  That is also a reason a lot of Ukraine channels uploading under a creative commons license. They want people in the west share the videos on their channels. So alone for this thing they cant be really blamed. It are other things.  I think I read somewhere that all US combat videos that where captured by TROOPS (not journalists or other private persons) in combat are public domain since the guys wearing the cameras are conducting official business for the US goverment funded by tax money and therefore it is public domain after being declassified.   That is also the reason the guy who made him famous with this ""U.S. Soldier Survives Taliban Machine Gun Fire During Firefight"" video could not do anything about its spread via Funker after releasing it no matter what Funker said about it the last time here in the forums. The main problem here was the Soldier declassified it by himself and got problems for this.   After the video was made public by the OP it became automaticly public domain footage so he couldnt do anything about it anymore and got blamed by the higher ups for releasing it. All he could do was to ask Funker to take it down who simply refused.  I think that it also the reason these wikileaks apache videos were  such a big problem.  Some stuff was send to Funker yes but most videos can be found elsewere on other channels who in fact want the videos to get shared. That is a thing much people tend to forget.  Here are the articels about the Helmet Cam video: http://www.9news.com.au/world/2013/01/30/16/29/us-soldier-under-fire-for-posting-helmet-cam-footage-online  http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/looking-behind-the-sightlines-of-an-american-soldier-under-taliban-fire/2013/01/26/a277af20-6180-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html  http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/u-s-soldier-made-helmet-cam-video-identified-article-1.1249696#commentpostform  And here is another articel about this public domain stuff was also posted here one time: http://www.michaelyon-online.com/watch-your-step.htm  And here is a video Funker definitly ripped from a smaller channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5aQLrHHfrk  And here his source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE3ez0GoOh4  The video was posted here and then funker took it or uploaded exactly the same at the same time since it has fitted to Funker530. This was no coincidence since the video was much older and wasnt just released at this time.  I am no lawyer but I think it makes sense and have read that somewere else too.  Well for combat footage channels. I think if they dont harm anyone with it and their main aim is to enlighten the wars and whats going on in some parts of the world I am okay with this. Then I am even okay if they make a few bucks from it. I think adri and Stahgewitter Syrien are such guys funny that the germans seem to be good guys this time. (I guess by their names and similar logos)  I must say that WarLeaks started pretty good in the beginning and also mentioned the original sources very often in much videos as I remember. Also they HAD proper descriptions not so detailed but they were there.  I think there started some sort of competition between Funker and Wareaks at some point WarLeaks went high up and in order to this booth channels or teams, as they always claim to be, lost their quality and reputation.  They even have stolen each others titles and descriptions numerous times.   For me competition about this kind of footage is a really bad thing and also very questionable but after it looks like this was all started by Funker who also has stolen descriptions form ""adri"" and ""stahlgewitter syrien"" before and actually seems wanting to monopolize combat footage as such. I would stick to WarLeaks since it is the smaller channel and really wasnt like this in the beginning I remember footage from there was very often extremly upvoted in the beginning of 2014 and these videos were not ripped form here before. They started it when Funker started it. I follow all of this channels for long now.   However as things stand now they are booth pretty selfish and bad guys right now.   Best guys I saw are Stahlgewitter Syrien, adri12345 and Purple Olive.   And if WarLeaks or Funker read this they better should leave the dark side of the force, stop fighting each other over views and stuff and come back to the light side and use their high amount of viewers to educate the people. Peace  EDIT: Links and stuff"
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,dynawhey,16,Tue Jul 21 06:18:55 2015 UTC,He won't be making revenue anymore. YouTube has banned advertising on ALL videos with combat footage. (even old WW2 documentary videos).
CombatFootage,3dzfwx,thecashblaster,12,Tue Jul 21 00:03:41 2015 UTC,Did Youtube release a memo on this? I'm not doubting but an explanation could be ISIS videos getting ad money to fund their operations.

CombatFootage,3dzfwx,tinkthank,4,Tue Jul 21 01:30:56 2015 UTC,"It is mostly a indirect way to stop western channels to spread combat footage and other stuff.   They cant control it anymore.   I remember years ago footage from wars was extremly rare and you only saw stuff in tv or on a few places.   An example is the so called ceasefire in Ukraine.   Us reached combat footage here as the media still was talink the ceasefire was ongoing and stuff.   It is not only combat footage nearly everything ""critical"" from 9/11 to history was affected.  I read this in the google forums.   Most guys who are not as big as funker or other channels will stop now or change their hosting places were they wont reach that many people anymore.   Well in some ways this is also a very questionable move by YouTube but only my opinion.  But if you think about alternate media and independent journalists that attacks the free press by using financial pressure."

But the biggest gripe I had with him was how he explicitly edited his videos to be ""all the good bits"". I mean, to me this combat footage isn't entertaining like some movie. This is real shit and we should never enjoy watching people get killed. I like to see how and why things happen. So to me the best submissions here are the ones that give an overview, explain, a little context, etc.   But Funker350 videos were basically cut like a PvP video game edit. I was expecting him to start adding Creed or some shit as background music. That never settled well with me.

CombatFootage,3dwelf,Silidistani,44,Mon Jul 20 07:04:43 2015 UTC,"The hill fight is stupidity, this one just ticks me off.  ""I'm moving down!""  To what firing location, specifically?  There's no cover nor concealment anywhere on that open hillside, except for small 1-foot-wide rocks.  He essentially made himself a perfect target by getting up and walking down an exposed hillside that was already under direct fire.  They are clearly taking fire from positions that can reach that whole, exposed hillside, because you hear rounds going by the whole time and see rock strikes - that's the clue to seek cover or somehow channel Carlos Hathcock and make your next few shots impact on the shooter(s), preferably in that order.  Dude is just popping shots off with little to no aim at targets hundreds of meters away (effective range on the M4 is 500m)... so he's just wasting ammo once he has started his move (you can see his careful aim disappear after this).  Then the enemy sees him moving along the hillside and he of course becomes a prime target.  With all the rock strikes around him he's lucky the enemy can't shoot well either and they don't get him in the first 5 seconds.  Then the enemy finally finds his range and hits him, which now means more US troops are going to have to go out into that open fire-swept hillside to save his ass.  Hopefully there's a smoke available to cover his retrieval.  /rant  Edit: love the downvotes from people with no clue, stay classy."
CombatFootage,3dwelf,tinkthank,12,Mon Jul 20 15:36:40 2015 UTC,he's lucky the enemy can't shoot well either and they don't get him in the first 5 seconds.   If anything they were shooting very well. I don't think the Taliban are using anything but iron sights and those were incredibly accurate shots.
CombatFootage,3dwelf,Silidistani,5,Mon Jul 20 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"It seems to me they found him by volume, not precision (which is still a totally valid method).  Irons can do a lot - you qualify with irons out to 450m, and you're expected to hit the target each time still.  He was out in the open for a while with (probably) multiple shooters going for him until they finally got range on him.  Maybe it took one of their better shooters to finally hit him, who knows."
CombatFootage,3dwelf,aerobert,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:29 2015 UTC,According to the youtube description he said he attempted to draw fire away from his pinned down squad during a recon patrol.
CombatFootage,3dwelf,Silidistani,26,Mon Jul 20 16:50:19 2015 UTC,"And that is fucking stupid if you're only going to get hit and then call for those same guys to have to come rescue you!  If he was expecting to sacrifice himself and return to the unit on his own if he was able to that's maybe one thing, but he clearly wasn't.  There's also no call outs from anyone else that they heard him or anything.  Assuming this was even a necessity, if they had actually fallen back while he was moving... who did he expect was going to still be hanging around to come get his ass once he was shot?  Also, according to some of his company members that's BS he made up later to account for why he made such a stupid move.  Of course the media ate that up.  You don't go draw fire to get your men out without expecting to draw fire and get shot.  If you need to exfil and need cover for it you use smoke - I have to think someone there had some they could have used if the situation was that dire.  I heard nonstop ragging on this on military video channels when it first came up and it was the same shit I'm ragging on it for here.  This comment on YouTube (of all places) is spot on:   What not to do in a gunfight. Run, without cover downhill.  Take a round in your armor and sit there and yell I'M HIT.  How about GET YOUR FUCKING WEAPON BACK IN THE FIGHT    We don't know if the round impacts armor or not by what's seen here - but in a firefight there's no medicine in the open without suppression, even hit you should continue to fight if you're still taking fire for as long as you can hold your rifle (my Ranger friend, buried in Arlington, did that) and you are your own first aid in a fight if you can still work at least 1 arm.    I'm sure Pfc. Daniel's brain was racing, adrenaline was pumping and he thought he was going to do ""something good"" - the road to failure is paved with good intentions.  Watching this video is just aggravating."

CombatFootage,3dwelf,HK_Urban,4,Mon Jul 20 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"If its a headspace and timing issue, you might not want to fix it right there in the heat of the moment.  An NCO in our unit almost died because one of his soldiers failed to conduct proper headspace and timing prior to leaving the wire.  The soldier tried to fire the weapon and it malfunctioned.  I don't know the specifics since I don't have the 15-6 investigation in front of me and I wasn't on that patrol.  He basically said the same thing ""the .50 won't fire"" so the NCO hopped up into the turret to attempt to rectify the weapon and somewhere in the process, the weapon action exploded.  Literally exploded.  Photos from the investigation showed the M2's feed tray cover ref1 ref2 literally torn off of the weapon and twisted like a piece of metal from a car crash.  A piece of metal shrapnel from the gun penetrated the NCO's thigh and hit the femoral artery.  Luckily the PJ's (Pedro) were in the area and on station to get him a rapid MEDEVAC to KAF.  So yeah, the soldier fucked up royally at maintaining his weapon, almost resulting in the death of his NCO.  Not at all insinuating that's the case here, but just pointing out that there's a reason you might not want to do anything beyond immediate action in the field."

CombatFootage,3dwelf,SevenForOne,4,Mon Jul 20 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"It's a common issue with all high rpm weapons. Firing at the cyclic rate the M2's barrel can actually get so hot that you can see the rounds fly threw the barrel. The SOP for a possible cooked round is to wait around 15 minutes, however, it also depends on the situation such as the temperature outside, how long the machine gun was fired, etc."

CombatFootage,3dwelf,SevenForOne,2,Tue Jul 21 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"There is a certain way you have to configure the 50 cal. Headspace is the right amount of space needed between the barrel and the rest of the gun, timing is the right amount of space needed in the bolt. It's been awhile since I've disassembled one but if the timing is off (it also might be head space can't quite remember) the M2 will actually fire on safe. If the other one is off you won't be able to shoot automatically and the chance of something bad happening are greatly increased.    Edit: Here's a tutorial"

CombatFootage,3dwelf,SevenForOne,2,Tue Jul 21 09:20:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try and explain why he may have not tried to fix the jam. The only reason I can think of as to why he just tried to re-rack the 50 and not take out the jam is probably because of the heat. There's always a good chance of having a cook off when you have been firing at cyclic and in 120+ degree weather. If he started taking it apart and a round went off, he could lose most of his hand."

But it does jerk around but that's likely from wind and the computer continuing to correct the course of the missile. The missiles travel at something like 300 m/s so it is possible to see it for a couple seconds but they likely either heard it be launched or saw the black smoke it was producing early in flight

You would have to be a powerlifter to even lift it up, and no man on earth would be able able to fire one from the shoulder accurately. For comparison, a 1000cc Kawasaki Ninja weights about 230 kilograms. Try lifting that on your shoulder.  The SPG-9 on the other hand weights only about 55 kilograms. Which is still very heavy, but only 1/4 of the weight of the M40. One could potentially fire one from the shoulder without needing superhuman strength."

We had these weapons when I was in the infantry back in the 60s...Both the 90mm shoulder-fired and the 105mm vehicle-mounted.

CombatFootage,3du837,legitbadman,2,Sun Jul 19 16:49:50 2015 UTC,Why is it called a recoiless rifle? It seems like it has a lot of recoil...
CombatFootage,3du837,tinkthank,6,Sun Jul 19 18:47:14 2015 UTC,a weapon with recoil gives you a kick when you fire the weapon and have to re-aim every time like artillery or anti-tank gun.   A recoilless weapon does the opposite. It doesn't kick when you fire it. The massive blast when they fired it kept the platform steady and remained in same position. It's pretty effective but isn't very stealthy. It will reveal your position very easily because of that blast.   this video explains the physics behind it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WI_XNJenQg

CombatFootage,3du837,kushmonger,20,Mon Jul 20 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"The definition has become muddied over time. Wikipedia:   A recoilless rifle (RCLR) or recoilless gun is a type of lightweight tube artillery that is designed to allow some of the propellant gases to escape out the rear of the weapon at the moment of ignition, creating forward thrust that counteracts some of the weapon's recoil. This allows for the elimination of much of the heavy and bulky recoiling mechanisms of a conventional cannon while still enabling the unit to fire a powerful projectile. Besides this, the lower pressures involved allow thinner walled and lighter tubes, lowering further the weight of the cannon. Technically, only devices that use a rifled barrel are recoilless rifles. Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles.[1]  Though it is similar in form and appearance to a rocket launcher, it fires modified artillery shells, not rockets. The key difference from rocket launchers (whether man-portable or not) is that the projectile of the recoilless rifle has no propulsion of its own—once out of the rifle, it behaves as a normal artillery shell and does not accelerate further, as a missile or rocket would. Nevertheless, there are also boost-after-launch rocket-propelled projectiles available for modern recoilless rifles."

If you don't have consistent amounts of propellant, with consistent weight of shell+explosive, then each shot is going to be wildly different.

That's simply been doctrinal Russian warfare and propaganda for the last couple of years.  Otherwise, it's a straight up war crime (which is not to excuse the war crimes of the Russian military in Ukraine).

Russia's goal is to keep the conflict hot, keep the DNR fighting and keep the population anti-Ukraine, and this is one way they've done that in the past. Ukraine could also be responsible but the only way to answer that is to look at the evidence, such as where the rockets came from, not to delude ourselves with nonsense about how Russia wouldn't bomb ""themselves""."

The video has a slick ISIS vibe to it, which is weird especially since Ansar al-Sharia are part of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.   For those interested in the differences in ISIS vs Al Qaeda video editing, read this interesting article:  Jihadology - ISIS and the Hollywood visual style"
CombatFootage,3dmd29,purpleolive,5,Fri Jul 17 16:21:32 2015 UTC,"They aren't part of AQIM. They're very independent, which allows them to fully dictate their policy towards other groups. They fight alongside IS in Benghazi without any issues, but did not pick sides when fighting broke out between IS and Abu Salim in Derna. They prefer to stay focused on fighting the Tobruk government.  I love that article, but Ansar al-Sharia does not belong on the al-Qaeda side here either. In my opinion, this video is almost identical in visual quality to the average video from a well-established IS provincial media office. You can tell they learned from IS and did not just copy their ways blindly (unlike certain groups in Syria). Much like IS, they also regularly release images of mostly non-combat events; charity, public services, and so on."

Not simply because they can replenish them, because they've shown they have consistent problems with manpower.  But it's irrelevant.  The people running Daesh ran the Ba'athist Iraqi Army a decade and a half ago, they aren't stupid.  They want this, they want to infuriate not only the west, but all those who won't kneel, because they don't care about who they lose.    One phrase they like to bandy about with is 'Die in your rage', and that really sums it up.  That sinking feeling you get watching the execution videos, reading that five-hundred more Yezidis were executed, reading about sex slaves, all of that is what they want you to feel.  Because it's what al-Qaeda wanted you to feel.  They want every nation of the world to fight them, just as they did before, because we'll cripple them, sure, put them on their knees, but we won't beat them.

I don't know of too many systems that can be operated without extensive electronics, guidance, or even outside of its native platform/system. There are a few Korean and Chinese missiles that can be fired 'in the rough' but not with great reliability, range, or accuracy.

Good in battle, bad anytime else. No navy ship anywhere would be able to arm CIWS fast enough to intercept a missle fired from that close unless they were waiting for it. This patrol craft won't have point defense weapons like CIWS installed though. Too small of a ship/too expensive a system."

CIWS is a very smart ""dumb"" system. A silkworm ASCM was fired at the Jarrett, Missouri, and a British ship, and CIWS was armed on the Jarrett. The Missouri responded by firing chaff (as they were supposed to) and CIWS did what it does best, locked on to the large, moving radar return from the chaff and shot the shit out of it. Only 4 rounds actually hit the Missouri though, and no one was hurt.   Fun fact, the Gloucester (the British ship) engaged and shot down the missile after it passed them (it was tracking towards the Missouri). This is the only recorded hard kill against an ASCM in actual combat by a surface ship. Electronic Countermeasures are generally accepted as being a more consistent defense."
CombatFootage,3di7op,equatorbit,5,Fri Jul 17 16:14:29 2015 UTC,It's a patrol boat. A ciws is toone large to mount.
CombatFootage,3di7op,purpleolive,7,Fri Jul 17 18:23:10 2015 UTC,What countermeasures in particular would you propose  ? it is not like it is likely to be targeting using radar or heat. Most likely it was just some homemade type rocket.
CombatFootage,3di7op,John_E_Vegas,14,Fri Jul 17 00:57:45 2015 UTC,Could it be an anti-tank missile?
CombatFootage,3di7op,Xx_MR_X_xX,51,Thu Jul 16 15:03:38 2015 UTC,Most likely this was an ATGM strike.

CombatFootage,3di7op,djn808,4,Thu Jul 16 15:14:58 2015 UTC,Most US Navy ships use a c-ram to prevent getting hit by a guided missile
CombatFootage,3di7op,StingAuer,13,Thu Jul 16 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"Those measures are meant against ship or plane launched anti ship missiles that you can track on radar and have time to intercept several miles from your ship.  This ships looks like it's about kilometer from the shore, and is hit with a wire guided anti tank missile. There is no good defense against that, apart from not being this close to the shore. The missile will only spend two to three seconds in flight at this range."
CombatFootage,3di7op,Aurailious,3,Thu Jul 16 15:52:12 2015 UTC,CIWS?
CombatFootage,3di7op,stuckinthepow,13,Thu Jul 16 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"CIWS intercepts at range, not close up, and spews shittons of bullets towards the target. Even if it could track the missile you'd end up mowing down the beachfront by using it.  EDIT: To clarify, the missile was shot from the coast at a fairly close range. a CIWS system, while being short for Close-In-Weapons-System, still needs some distance to acquire and track the target."

CombatFootage,3di7op,gp556by45,6,Thu Jul 16 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but an ATGM is going to be smaller and probably have a different flight profile (including the short range) than a typical anti ship missile or other typical threat, further compounding the problem of identifying, tracking, and intercepting the threat."
CombatFootage,3di7op,ThisDerpForSale,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:14 2015 UTC,"Right.  Of course, the flip side to that is that an ATGM isn't going to have quite the destructive potential on a vessel than it would on an armored vehicle.

CombatFootage,3di7op,gp556by45,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would be surprised if a CIWS radar system would identify something as small and slow (relatively) as an ATGM as a treat to shoot it down."

Most military grade explosives produce almost no flame, as fire is just wasted energy. What you want is concussive force, preferably in the form of a shaped charge. Also, it's much more effective to take down a ship if the detonation occurs underwater. What was the end result of the attack? The ship doesn't seem to have sustained a large amount of damage."
CombatFootage,3di7op,Whitechocolatekrispi,3,Thu Jul 16 16:25:19 2015 UTC,Probably diesel fuel from ruptured tank.

Look up the difference between burning (ie Deflagration) and detonation. Pretty much all military explosives burn quite happily (some of the newer very insensitive ones not so much) when you put a flame against them. They are designed too. You do not want burning to detonation. When you hit them with a sufficient force (ie a detonator exploding into them) they detonate, but it has to be sufficiently large.  Storing tons of explosive on a ship, would you rather they burn out, or all go bang at once?  Here watch and educate yourself.

CombatFootage,3dj7q9,purpleolive,2,Fri Jul 17 11:58:26 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/purpleolive. You seem quite organized when it comes to ISIS videos. I was wondering if I could ask you a question.  Is there an order to how ISIS videos are released, like a series? I remember watching what was maybe their first professionally produced video. It had them doing drive by shootings, ripping passports up and close quarter combat. The second professional video I watched was the ""flames of war"" which was dubbed by someone who spoke clear English. Have they ever produced anything that follows flames of war? Since then I have mainly seen head-cam footage, actually I did see their video which showed VBIEDS, it started with a digger and then a truck VBIED.   I'm not an ISIS supporter at all but I find it interesting to watch their propaganda. It gives you an idea into how they see their world."
CombatFootage,3dj7q9,rudimentarypolitics,2,Sat Jul 18 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"not purpleolive but Its true ISIS hasnt released a super long video in a while but could also have to do with the relatively few military victories since Ramadi. Even since Flames of war it seems they saw the power these videos had and decided to do more shorter videos compared to a few long ones. This is just my personal opinion and i have no confirmation about this but i suspect each ISIS military district, they have a bunch in Iraq and Syria, is required to produce a video or at least give footage to ISIS HQ to be released like every 2 months. It really seems lately that ISIS rarely ever releases videos from the same military district twice in a row, they seem to rotate and it seems deliberate.   ISIS did produce a longer video for the anniversary of capturing Mosul that you might find interesting, mostly  footage already released but some new ones and it actually tells a story instead of their shorter combat videos."

CombatFootage,3dgcyz,Seanzie82,41,Thu Jul 16 04:03:40 2015 UTC,"Read the book On Killing by Dave Grossman.  It talks a lot about why Vietnam in particular was so hard on the soldiers.  They were disconnected from the other soldiers (didn't enter and exit as a unit).  They were fighting people in civilian clothes, including children.  And they were hated and spat upon when they got home.  It was more psychologically devastating than any other US war."
CombatFootage,3dgcyz,TheAethereal,13,Thu Jul 16 11:54:37 2015 UTC,And there was a draft. Kind of blows your mind to think there was a draft conscription to send people off to fight a war that was of absolutely no importance to US security. People were incensed.

CombatFootage,3dgcyz,R50cent,20,Thu Jul 16 19:51:07 2015 UTC,"who would be that stupid?   I remember thinking the same thing before I went in.   Like why? Who on earth would do that?  However, I've run into some pretty hostile people since I've been back. After my share of dealing with some of the crazies, I can easily see how civilians get worked up and can get caught up in the political fervor.   I have a few of my own stories of getting harassed when I went back to college.   One time after a political philosophy class, about 10-15 members of my local SDS chapter gathered outside the door to the parking lot and followed me all the way to my truck; chiding me the whole way.   Some of the awesome comments/questions were;   ""How do you live with yourself after the things you've seen/done?"" (based on the discussion in class and alluding to the ""fact"" we all wantonly ""murdered"" civilians)  ""Is it true you guys were told to kill women and children?""  ""I heard there's complete disorganization in the ranks- what was that like?""  ""How bad is the drug problem over there?""  The questions were understandable given the way the media would report on things. But the way they were angrily firing off those comments was not only accusatory and generally rhetorical, but the closer I got to my car, the louder and more angry these people got.   They were not happy with any of my answers. When asked how many civilians I killed, I replied with ""none"". One of them responded with something to effect of ""Oh.. you must have back behind the line then huh.""   ""No, I was involved with some of the most brutal battles in theater."" I explained that the men I served with showed the utmost restraint, that we didn't suffer from ""disorganization"" at all, and that 99% of the soldiers I served with were more drug free than the class we had just attended.  Of course at that point, I was labeled a ""shill"" and a liar.   I really wanted to reason with those people. I wanted to explain to them that the news reports they were watching weren't good reflections on the conduct of most of the soldiers over there. Or that many times, ""militia"" and ""civilians"" were interchangeable terms depending on the situation. Militia member that just took potshots at your patrol, turns a corner and ditches his weapon? ""Civilian"".   But there was no talking to any of them. They had their ideas of what was happening and that was that. I don't think I've ever been more frustrated in my life. I did what I could to deescalate the tensions, but I could easily see another vet in my position losing his/her composure and riling up these folks even more.  I wish gopro footage could've been more prevalent at the time, because all too often even the embedded reporters would take a very clear engagement and 'muddy the waters' for the sake of sensationalism. That shit happened all the time and it fucks people up back home.   I can only imagine what it was like for Vietnam vets. Without any sort of perspective people would've been 100% at the mercy of the media's slant. Thankfully we have the internet which tends to show the brutality of the 'enemy' in a way no press would show now or then.  Still, some people choose to ignore that and intentionally get themselves riled up."

CombatFootage,3dgcyz,Joshington024,7,Fri Jul 17 10:31:02 2015 UTC,"It worked like this: A unit might leave the states as a ""unit"" in the sense that they had formed and trained as a group. However the normal vietnam tour for an individual soldier was 12 months; so what happened is the original unit remained in vietnam except the individuals within it rotated back to the states to be replaced by others taking their place/job. You ended up with the vets leaving and the green guys showing up which destroyed the units original cohesiveness.   Here is my own experience. My unit the 199th Light Infantry Brigade arrived in vietnam Nov of 1966. The members had all trained together for months prior to their assignment to vietnam. By Nov of 67 their tours were coming to an end and replacements (myself among them) were arriving to take over their slot or job within the brigade. After the manpower changeover you had what in essence was a newly staffed brigade, practically every one as green to conducting operations and combat as those who had arrived a year earlier but were now back home. Nov of 68 the whole thing repeated.   As a replacement you were expected to spend a couple of weeks learning your task and purpose, getting aclaimated and generally sorted out, then were sent out to do it for real out in the bush.   tl;dr: there was a constant turnover in GI's in any particular unit due to the standard one-year tour."

CombatFootage,3dgcyz,Diabeetush,9,Thu Jul 16 06:22:13 2015 UTC,"I can't claim to have any experience with combat or taking lives, but I would think that dehumanizing your enemy would be vital to a) surviving and b) not dwelling on the fact that you're ending someone's life. Even if it's justified, I imagine most people don't shrug off killing another human without any sort of mental effects. Putting on that mindset probably just helps you get through the day."
CombatFootage,3dgcyz,Seanzie82,17,Thu Jul 16 07:12:03 2015 UTC,"Even if it's justified, I imagine most people don't shrug off killing another human without any sort of mental effects.   I've killed my share of people. Every single one of them wanted me or my friends dead.  I didn't (and still don't) feel a fucking thing for them.   Here's why I've reasoned I've not had any compunction about it:  When you're put in the position of having to deal with your own mortality, each and every single day- when you deal with someone else that is constantly trying to kill you; your mind does some funny stuff.  You come to terms with your own death in a very real way. I know most guys I was with honestly, at the bottom of their hearts and cores of their minds didn't think they were going to make it back. They had reasoned that they were, in all likelihood, going to die.   When your mind does that, it puts you in a different place. I won't call it a dark place, because in a weird way, it's a sort of peace. It's not an angry or even a scared state of being- it's a sort of 'it is what it is' feeling of acceptance.   Once you get there for your own death, I think it's very easy to see your enemy as having the same type of mentality. They know what they're doing when they pick up that weapon:  They're pulling the lever on the cosmic slot machine of life, just as I am. Right and wrong don't matter once that lever is pulled. It's a little bit of luck and a little bit of skill which determines whether you keep breathing once the reel stops.   One thing I will say is that watching your buddies die never gets easy. There's a whole lot of guilt and heartbreak. Especially if you've even for second, during the heat of the moment thought: ""fuck... better him than me."" Most soldiers at some point, have had those feelings in the heaviest of the shit.. and they can be the most horrible things to reflect upon once the dust settles."

Before YouTube and reddit, this just circulated around gore sites and they got absolutely everything reported wrong.  I don't think I've ever even heard of /r/watchpeopledie brigade or harass anyone.

I can't find it on reddit now, but basically what happened is that these guys were going somewhere in this civilian truck. I don't remember why, but it actually seemed kind of logical when the man who recorded it came onto this sub (or /r/videos) and explained it.   The bomb went off and didn't kill anyone, but I think someone was hurt by shrapnel. He uploaded the footage in the early days of youtube, but it didn't get a huge number of hits. He would basically find his video copied all over the internet, and especially on gore sites, that said everyone was killed. Also that they were soldiers. Sometimes they even said it was in Afghanistan.  He basically set the record straight on reddit, but now I can't find the post.  I saved part of his quote to a file, but it got corrupted or something:   The story is, we were transporting two guys back to base for interrogation (not by us, the battalion HET team on base). We had walked a good ways out to get these guys, and not wanting to walk back, we decided to drive them in their own (unarmored) vehicle. I   That's all that I have.

A Colombian army Black Hawk helicopter landed in a minefield in a rural area of Teorama municipality in Norte de Santander province, and four of the soldiers on board were killed in the resulting explosion, military officials said Monday.  According to reports from the soldiers on board the transport helicopter, six of whom were wounded, the explosives at the landing site were placed and detonated by the terrorist group FARC.   The helicopter, belonging to the army's 33rd Mobile Brigade, was carrying 15 soldiers, local media reported.  Operating in that area bordering on Venezuela are guerrillas of the FARC, the National Liberation Army (ELN), and the Popular Liberation Army (EPL).

Either ""politically-motivated separatists"" or ""drug cartel"" would be much more appropriate. My understanding is that they exist somewhere on a spectrum between those two, but moved from the former to more of the latter over the decades.  also, the way that is written, is that the FARC manually detonated the charges. If that's true, I'm really surprised they didn't continue the ambush and kill more of the soldiers than just let the explosives do their thing. I wonder if that was just not written well, and landmines were just tripped by the exiting soldiers rather than be actively detonated by the FARC."

CombatFootage,3dd80g,0masterdebater0,18,Wed Jul 15 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think rokok was saying that terrorist had to have an religious affiliation, just that the term terrorist (as defined by you) was a misnomer for this group.  The problem with the definition of terrorist is that it can be broadly applied to the point of losing any meaning. Any political body with a military wing can be called a terrorist organization because of the implicit threat the existence of the military arm represents.  What more is a military than a force of intimidation that can be used for political aims (even if never deployed)."
CombatFootage,3dd80g,axearm,40,Wed Jul 15 17:07:41 2015 UTC,Doesn't that definition make the United States (and pretty much every nation with active military foreign intervention) terrorists ?

CombatFootage,3dd80g,bossmcsauce,3,Wed Jul 15 19:24:58 2015 UTC,"So, does the claim ""they are terrorist"" make for a casus belli ? Or do you need more before you can start killing people, like those FARC guys ?"
CombatFootage,3dd80g,shodanx,3,Wed Jul 15 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand the question entirely, or if this answers it, but I'll say this- Even if you have a reason for war, you're still a terrorist by engaging in warfare as it is modernly conducted- going to somebody's house any time of day, smashing their shit down, and shooting the place up. Even if they are the enemy combatants, if they aren't meeting you on the field of battle, I think it counts to a degree, ESPECIALLY if it's in a populated area where there are civilians around as well. Obviously its a really grey area as somebody stated above...   but I think it's safe to say that even if your actions of war are ""justified"", or are in an effort to truly benefit a civilian population, you still become a terrorist to a group of people when your actions of war cause civilians to be unable to safely live their lives without interruption or changes in their routines.   did you maybe mean ""before"", rather than ""because""? that would make more sense to me."

""those guys are bad, therefore it's ok to kill them... and if other people get hurt in the process, well... damn. oh well. It's for the good of everything, and to change the way they do things and think and believe will make the world better.""  I'm not saying that it's not right to do things that way, given the proper motives... I'm just saying that you can't cherry-pick realities that make the actions you believe in seem less brutal. I believe in plenty of things that the first-world nations have done to try to improve life in other nations... that doesn't mean that it didn't fuck up a lot of innocent people's lives though. terrorism is a perfectly normal part of human existence. It's a form of war. It's a product of war. they go together like legs and feet. the only big thing that sets ""terrorists"" apart from ""Soldiers"" in the public eye is generally that one is backed by a government, and the other isn't.

However, I kinda gotta agree with what you're saying, in that we attach the phrase ""terrorist"" to so many different groups around the world that it's almost lost its meaning.

The explosion seems to be centred a little to the left of the helicopter. If you watch for the third man to get out of the helicopter to the left you see it seems to be centred under him in fact, so it may have been trip-wire detonated or remote detonated (since you're right that it looks too big for an anti-personnel mine, and a man on foot isn't going to set off an anti-tank mine)."

Excerpt from wiki: Trials with nuclear weapons showed that a T-54 could survive a 2–15 kt nuclear charge at a range of more than 300 metres (980 ft) from the epicentre, but the crew only had a chance of surviving at 700 metres (2,300 ft).

My understanding is the Syrian Air Force doesn't have much in the way of air to ground missiles, but that they might be holding some in reserve. The sound of the jet in the background means it's not far away (bomb runs are usually made from close by), that the strike missed (bombs are less accurate), and the Syrian weapon availability might suggest a bomb over missile."

Not sure how many people he killed though, probably less than the communists (to be fair, he was also less successful than the communists). South Korea was much worse at that time as it had a very bloody dictator, but either way, it wasn't the business of US to intervene. A civil war is a civil war, foreign influence only screws things up worse.  Of course, since it was the Cold War, it was to be expected that US would intervene. Problem was, US miscalculated as historians now would say. Vietnam was never communist first. It was nationalist first. They didn't want to turn other countries communist, the whole 'Domino Theory' reason that Americans went in there to fight was bogus. The theory was that Vietnam would be like a domino causing the collapse of surrounding nations into communism. The reality was that Vietnam didn't want that, they just wanted to be left alone of foreign influence. But hey, Cold War, stuff like this was common. USSR intervened in Afghanistan where we thought we could have a friendly gov't but we were wrong, intervening in a civil war rarely solves issues. West tried to intervene in the Russian Civil War, only made the Bolsheviks mad at the West, didn't do any good either. Americans flew their flags over Vladivostok and Russians never forgot that during the Cold War.   In 1979-1980 China attacked Vietnam too, and also got their nose bloodied. In the 1950s the French got their noses smashed in Vietnam. Vietnam deserves its own place in history for smashing three major military powers in a row with roughly the same generation of people."

Visually you can see it's not that big. 8-9 guys shows group participation but doesn't mean it required 8-9. The explosion is behind a building and a dust cloud very hard to say from that other than a big bomb.  (Edit: On reflection I actually have no idea how much propellent is needed for a rocket. If it's a small enough, one could make a case for the tube being large enough to possibly reach 500lb or close to it, assuming they are using TNT)."

CombatFootage,3deq75,BorderColliesRule,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"Propellant tube is ~2.5 feet (2 feet plus section with the fins) by about eight inches. This page shows an ""O"" class equivalent Potassium Nitrate-Erithrytol motor construction. That's 6 inches. The real deal appears to be about the same diameter.  Another example is seen in this video, where the tube holding the propellant is about five feet. See also this video for an example of the power of an O-class sugar rocket.  The guys in the FSA sacrifice reliability and time of burn in favor of lifting power. Granted, given how slow sugar rockets can be they are obviously doing something well to get such a clean start. The propellant powering their warhead burns for less than three seconds, with one second of that putting it on a straight flight. They probably put several cores in the propellant to get it to burn very fast.  P.S. TNT can't be used to power a rocket. That much TNT would violently explode. This video shows seven kilos; just imagine 50 kg."

CombatFootage,3dc7vd,thefarcus,5,Wed Jul 15 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"I see tanks at that end of the video. I don't think tanks arrived until there was a serious Allied foothold:   ""The only high-command officer who responded correctly to the crisis at hand was Field Marshal Rundstedt, the old man who was there for window dressing and who was so scorned by Hitler and OKW. Two hours before the seaborne landings began, he ordered the two reserve panzer divisions available for counterattack in Normandy, the 12th SS Panzer and Panzer Lehr, to move immediately toward Caen. He did so on the basis of an intuitive judgment that the airborne landings were on such a large scale that they could not be a mere deception maneuver (as some of his staff argued) and would have to be reinforced from the sea. The only place such landings could come in lower Normandy were on the Calvados and Cotentin coasts. He wanted armor there to meet the attack.  Rundstedt's reasoning was sound, his action decisive, his orders clear. But the panzer divisions were not under his command. They were in OKW reserve. To save precious time, Rundstedt had first ordered them to move out, then requested OKW approval. OKW did not approve. At 0730 Jodi informed Rundstedt that the two divisions could not be committed until Hitler gave the order, and Hitler was still sleeping. Rundstedt had to countermand the move-out order. Hitler slept until noon.  The two panzer divisions spent the morning waiting. There was a heavy overcast; they could have moved out free from serious interference from Allied aircraft. It was 1600 when Hitler at last gave his approval. By then the clouds had broken up and Allied fighters and bombers ranged the skies over Normandy, smashing anything that moved. The panzers had to crawl into roadside woods and wait under cover for darkness before continuing their march to the sound of the guns."""

CombatFootage,3d5q0y,mattdent54,2,Wed Jul 15 10:35:00 2015 UTC,"Killing the enemy solely to kill the enemy isn't a strategy.  You're threatening nothing other than their will to continue to supply men to the battle.  Instead of working for a positive goal which will force compliance out of your enemy, you're hoping that they get sick of the war before you do.  It's thoughtless because any engagement will undoubtedly cause friendly casualties.  This then devolves into a waiting game of who can endure the slaughter longer.  It's a cold and misguided thought process which makes attrition the goal.    I think it was the Brigadier General they interviewed talking about not wanting to trade lives but that if they have to, 7 to 1 ain't bad odds (or something along those lines). Let me step back in time 50 years and smack him upside the head.  At the most basic level, the North Vietnamese leadership was willing to loose many times as many men in seizing South Vietnam as the US leadership was willing to lose defending it.  Take this engagement for example.  Over 4 days ~250 Americans were killed with +2x wounded, to kill ~1000-1500+ NVA regulars.  For what purpose?  Tear up some woodland?  After the battles at X-Ray and Albany the Cav troopers pulled out and left the territory to the enemy, with their leadership claiming victory because they had killed more than they had suffered.  So was that the plan moving forward?  Keep flying around, looking for fights and hope that they scream Uncle before you do?  Without a commitment to actually go after the North Vietnamese in their home bases and destroying their ability to make war, the writing was on the wall way back in 1965.  Unfortunately for the fifty or so thousand Americans who had still yet to die for their leadership's incompetence, no one was paying any attention."
CombatFootage,3d5q0y,Gorthol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:55:56 2015 UTC,Dude it was 1965 though and they were thinking it was going to be another Korea or even easier. I agree with you but the war barely started and they thought if they killed enough they would be forced to surrender. We all know now how much more complex the situation was.
CombatFootage,3d5q0y,mattdent54,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:03:17 2015 UTC,1965 may have been the beginning for US involvement in force but the North Vietnamese had been fighting on and off (mostly on) since 1946.  A successful 8 year war against the French and an growing insurgency in the South backed by the North for at least the last 5 years.  They had been at this for a while and were pretty clearly committed.
CombatFootage,3d57xi,purpleolive,23,Mon Jul 13 16:54:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're world leaders at production value in their respective field. Caching tunes, often good hd quality footage shot fearlessly, overly brutal and uncencored."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,persistent_derp,8,Mon Jul 13 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of arm chair generals talking shit in this thread about the lack of training demonstrated by ISIS in the video, I would beg to differ.  Of course, there is blind firing, excessive un-aimed ""suppressive fire"" which is clearly not effective, standing still in the open for no good reason, etc. This is all bad.   However, what you do see here is people closing with the enemy, checking their corners, and capturing fixed defensive positions. Frankly, its going to take tactics that seem out of the depth of most of ISIS's opposition to deal with that. I certainly haven't seen the Iraqi and Syrian security forces show anything like this. If anything the Iraqi's look better kitted but far less tactically sound than the ISIS videos that get posted. Terrifying really."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,VonHinterhalt,5,Tue Jul 14 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many ISIS died from friendly fire? They aren't trained in formation attacks, that's for sure."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,Cajun12,3,Mon Jul 13 23:35:22 2015 UTC,Tough to say since there is no 'they' as their units have very different levels or training. Some are able to do pretty good flanking maneuvers. others are just spray and pray.
CombatFootage,3d57xi,monopixel,2,Tue Jul 14 13:56:39 2015 UTC,I saw in these videos mostly spray and pray while moving in front of other ISIS who were spraying and praying at the same time. They must edit out those who are killed by FF.

CombatFootage,3d57xi,Moh7,14,Mon Jul 13 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"Damn, their lack of actual proper military training really shows."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,GenBlase,15,Mon Jul 13 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? They successfully assaulted multiple areas with 0 heavy weaponry. They had 0 armour covering them, they initiated an attack with suicide bombers to take out the entrenched areas and covered their assault with proper suppression fire so that they could get across a field and into close quarters.  They aren't like most armies where they have armour, artillery and a freaking air force covering them, they make due with what they have and they do extremely well at it."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,Gorthol,12,Mon Jul 13 19:43:21 2015 UTC,VS other guys with lack of military training. They don't seem to have much more than a handful of militias defending the place.   Plus they did have rockets and machine guns which counts as heavy weapons.
CombatFootage,3d57xi,Quarterwit_85,6,Mon Jul 13 22:57:14 2015 UTC,"They also look to be very aggressive and show a clear willingness to close with and destroy their enemy.  That's gotta count for something.    The fact that they're able to plan an attack, use supporting arms (suicide bomber) to initiate and then cover the assault across an open space shows some level of proficiency, no?  They then went and cleared a number of structures with grenades and rifle fire.  I don't see many of the militias showing the same aggressiveness, and effectiveness, in any of their POV combat videos.  It may well be a video availability supply thing, but I don't think it is.  Also, the seemed to be communicating well enough but the sound didn't work for me so I didn't really get the full experience."

CombatFootage,3d57xi,Moh7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:14:31 2015 UTC,The suicide tactics probably also have a substantial effect on enemy morale: the ISIS fighters want to die just to kill the enemy. That's terrifying.

In the states we talk a big game, are armed to the teeth civilian and military/Leo's alike. But id hazard a guess that less then 1 in 5 people can actually react let alone succeed in a fire fight not to mention total urban combat.  Point being; if it was say, a handfull of American civies with their mall ninja arms, vs. say a few 20 somethings from ISIS,  on american soil, ISIS has a huge advantage;  exeprience in urban combat for almost 50 years now say as far back as the Afghan russian war."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,resilientenigma,2,Mon Jul 13 23:25:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  We have average americans in our armed services who display more discipline, professionalism, and commitment in their soldiering when defending a foreign country on foreign soil.  That is the major difference between ISIS and the IA, IP, and militia's.  Commitment.  I believe average americans with their mall guns would display more commitment to defending their soil than ISIS would in taking it.   less then 1 in 5 people can actually react   That is a truth in modern militaries as well, not just civilian population.  Those one in five though, are all the difference and all it takes to win a battle."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,SeveredLimb,0,Mon Jul 13 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"US armed forces and Law enforcement are, imo, some of the most disciplined group of individuals I think ever. And wouldnt break a sweat defending home turf.   Technology aside, and this is my point, that middle eastern, and surrounding areas have seen their entire population  lose their green-ness to warfare. And this battle hardening changes the way an individual acts during a firefight.    1/5 can sway the odds, but so can 100 years of technical innovations, but without innovations, I am sorry, but the Sons of Iraq are just a much more ruthless people."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,resilientenigma,2,Tue Jul 14 00:01:11 2015 UTC,"Sons of Iraq   I was there.  I met them while they were being formed up and trained in escalation of force.  These guys were as much of a danger to themselves than anyone considered opposition.   that middle eastern, and surrounding areas have seen their entire population lose their green-ness to warfare   I see your point.  They never had that green-ness.  Their lives whether in direct conflict or not are a daily struggle for survival.  They are also callous to loss, which is their biggest weakness imo. Their lack of morality may seem like their strength, but against a free people fighting for their families survival, some religious ideology is not going to be enough.  Remember this as well.  They were able to blend in and use the local populations as  masks and shields.  We were the outlanders, we did not blend in.  Here, they would lose the biggest advantage they had over there, their anonymity.  Blending in would not be an option.  It's all hypothetical obviously and we're pissing in the wind at each other.  I would put my money on the average american, they have more to lose.  Sure, some would freeze up, those that do not... fire and brimstone will be with them.  edit:   The SOI were bought.  The sheiks were paid and the money distributed amongst the tribes.  Their allegiance was nothing more than a facade.  They weren't fighting for any ideal or freedom, it was for money.  Someone, somewhere had an agenda and it only took a little bit of money to sway them in a different direction.  Basically, we paid them (SOI) a little more than the other guys to stop fighting."

I agree with this so much. I'm writing a paper on the various ways IS is attempting to construct legitimacy as a state and writing it has been a bit of a journey. I don't in any way support them, but when you examine the situation from their perspective it becomes clear that there is a lot more than just 1-dimensional extremism. I mean, they are drawing on a solid historical precedent and a widespread disillusionment with the Western model of society / Western-backed governments in the Arab world.    At its outset, however, during the second half of the nineteenth century, Salafism was not an anti-Western ideology. On the contrary, it was Arab admiration for the modernized West that gave birth to the movement. Fascinated by European development, Arab countries began to compare their socioeconomic and political conditions with those of Europe. (...) Salafism, therefore, has always sought to modernize the Arab world, and it had identified the Ottoman Empire as the primary cause of the Arab failure to develop. To overcome this obstacle, the Salafist doctrine called for all Muslims to go back to the purity of religion, to the origins of Islam and the teachings of the Prophet.   Then later when the Arab world was kinda sold out by Europe (and 'westernized' Arab leaders) the focus switched to European/Western society as the cause of the region's economic and political subordination.   It's a dangerous underestimation to not earnestly consider the possibility of their success. They don't need to win the approval of the entire world, just of the Sunni umma. If they refined their message and cut back on the sadism / oppression (... well, then they wouldn't be IS anymore, but..) I honestly think they'd have a good chance of actually establishing some sort of Caliphate."
CombatFootage,3d57xi,gashfucker,2,Wed Jul 15 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"It's the way they are handling their weapons, how they advance as invidual/ group in urban and open areas, their communication etc, I barely see any invidual skill, maybe as a group they are more capable, but they are not a force ill be worried about fighting  as an organized modern military."

CombatFootage,3d3w6a,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:59:39 2015 UTC,That looked bad. Can't tell how many people were at the front tho. Were they defusing and it went wrong?
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,r1ddler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yea I saw at least one body in the air, so either they were diffusing or someone hit a tripwire or pressure plate."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,Sedsibi2985,2,Mon Jul 13 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"If it was a pressure plate, wouldn't it technically be a mine? Or does the home-madeness make it an IED anyway?"
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,5,Mon Jul 13 22:19:16 2015 UTC,"You could call it a mine, but 'victim operated pressure plate IED' is more accurate. An improvised explosive devices (IED) is what it's name implies, something that uses parts from various sources that may, or may not, be intended to create an explosive device, to create one.   Due to the explosion size this is likely not a manufactured mine. Anti personnel mines are much smaller, and vehicle mines use penetrators to overcome armor more then brute force. This was likely a cluster of artillery shells judging by the blast size. Detonation method would be pure speculation."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,Sedsibi2985,2,Mon Jul 13 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"Hah! IED! Why didn't I know, I should have guessed that acronym. You sound like an exert, thanks. So rigging a few artillery shells to a detonator actually works.. wow. I guess if the shells go off under a pressure plate, for example, it doesn't really matter where the projectiles end up, because the explosion will be huge on the spot. Am I understanding this right?  Or rather, the projectiles would just shoot into the dirt at that spot.. if pointed down?"
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,5,Mon Jul 13 23:29:30 2015 UTC,"Artillery shells aren't like bullets. They are closer to bombs in operation. The projectile is just explosives in a bullet shaped metal case, and a detonator screw's onto the top of it. Depending on the type of artillery piece firing the projectile the detonator could be timed, impact, or proximity (for AAA weapons). The projectiles are fired like a bullet though, again depending on the type of artillery the powder can be integrated with the projectile like you imagine a bullet, or loaded in the beach behind the projectile in bags. Both systems are in use as they each have advantages and disadvantages.  Case less artillery rounds can be fired at varying distances easier and allows for time on target fire missions. These are where multiple rounds are fired at varying velocities and varying elevations, so all the rounds land at the same place at roughly the same time, even though they were fired at different times. The crew size for these pieces is larger and requires more training then cased shells.  Cased is easier to shoot and requires a smaller crew."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,Sedsibi2985,2,Mon Jul 13 23:50:49 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I love you LOL! I never knew artillery shells had explosive material inside the shell! I thought the explosions were caused just by the kinetic energy of the projectile. So you're saying they rig up artillery shells as IEDs because they're each a bomb, in their own right. I thought it was only the velocity of the 'bullet' which caused those explosions I've seen in artillery videos.  If I can ask another question.. Is the rectangular flat one a pressure plate IED like an improvised mine? Also, the cylindrical one, looks like it can hold more explosive material.. is that one rigged to blow in a different manner? I always thought IEDs were basically home made mines, but you have me intrigued, I want to know more!  edit#1/   link: http://imgur.com/a/PIrJX  edit#2/   PS: Is all anti-aircraft-artillery detonated by proximity? Super interesting stuff, thanks again"
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,3,Tue Jul 14 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the squares, they kind of resemble a pressure plate. The cylinders look like the housing for an Explosive Formed Penetrator (EFP). EFP's are designed to punch through armor from the side with a jet of copper in a plasma state. Nasty things, a few guys I served in Iraq with lost limbs to those.  As for AAA it varies in what is fired. Most militaries have moved away from AAA in favor of SAMs but guns are still around. Proximity fuses, time delays, and barometric or altitude fuses are all regularly used. Most current AAA is radar guided so they can get away with any of the fuses reasonably successfully."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,Sedsibi2985,2,Tue Jul 14 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"You guys are awesome, I hope if I have any military/weapons related questions I can just ask you instead of posting comments?"
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,2,Tue Jul 14 03:53:14 2015 UTC,ISIS isnt the same as during the iraqi insurgancy or the Taliban. Theyve largely stopped using the old shell method because they are using artillery more and more. ISIS has factories set up manufacturing these IEDs and they use real explosive material imported from Turkey and other areas.   Heres ISIS manufacturing some of these pressure plate IEDs   http://imgur.com/a/PIrJX
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,IgorForHire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"Nice pics and explanation man, thanks! Why do you think ISIS is using less old shell method, and more artillery of their own? Is it because they have won enough battles to steal artillery from Iraqi Army/SAA?"
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,2,Tue Jul 14 03:19:29 2015 UTC,Yep. ISIS despite their motivations are actually fighting in the open like a proper military more than in the past. So they are using artillery shells how they were intended.
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,Sedsibi2985,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"Dont you think AAA is expensive to try and shoot down airplanes vs conventional AA rounds? I mean it's hard as hell to hit a plane anyway, I imagine hundreds of rounds being wasted trying to hit one. It's like your friend throwing a rock in the air, and you trying to throw another to hit the first one before it falls (I'm proud of this analogy lol)."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,2,Tue Jul 14 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"If by conventional AA you mean machine guns pointed at the sky, then more expensive, but more effective as well. If you mean missiles then its significantly cheaper, but less effective. However in reality most modern AA isn't AAA. Triple A died as a thing shortly after WWII, due to the advent of missiles which serve the same function and are more effective.  While your analogy isn't too far from the mark, except that your rock explodes if it gets within a few dozen feet of the other rock, and the angle and velocity you need to throw the rock to put your rock within the few dozen feet of the target is calculated by a computer and radar tracking system which then throws the rock for you.  The Oerlikon is a good example of modern AA guns."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,Sedsibi2985,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much, im sure they still use it quite a bit when they are desperate and on the defensive. But if they have the artillery pieces they are going to use the ammo for that compared to IEDs. ISIS has bit off more than it could chew and went from like a guerilla warfare group to being forced to fight conventional battles on multiple fronts. They need the artillery to help soften up targets and suicide trucks are expensive and take time to build. They only operate artillery in a few places though and most of it's been destroyed."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,IgorForHire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"What do you guys mean, they bit off more than they could chew? What kind of fighting were they doing when they started, and why do you believe they fight more like a proper military now.. out of necessity I presume? Their battles used to have less people participating, or are they actually becoming war-savvy and a real threat?"
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,3,Tue Jul 14 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"ISIS is what used to be one of the Insurgent groups in Iraq during the US occupation. During Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) they were a guerrilla group, meaning they would plant roadside bombs and shoot mortars at US bases, etc. When ISIS first came on the scene they started in Syria, where there wasn't a strong government to stop them, only other rebel groups to contend with.   They stood out from the rest due to their brutality and desire to not only overthrow the Syrian government but to form a Caliphate. This brutality made them feared so enemy forces would simply run at the sight of them. This allowed them to expand very rapidly and conquer territory.  Now that they are occupying land, and not just fighting an army, they have to stand up and fight or lose what they have gained. This is also true when trying to take new land. While initially their reputation alone was breaking armies before a real fight broke out, now that they have suffered a number of significant defeats, the armies and militias opposing ISIS are more willing to fight. So now ISIS has to actually fight for cities and towns. This is a real war for them now, and real wars require real logistics, something ISIS isn't well prepared for, they can't move the men and machines into positions easily, due to the coalition air forces bombing anything they can find in the open.   Additionally ISIS has relied on shock tactics to win battles, often initiating an attack with a VBIED or two and following it up with 'infantry'. If their VBIED's are defeated they don't have a real backup plan, other then to charge with whatever infantry they have, or retreat."

CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"Mines are not actually deployed to just to kill or maim as IED's are.  Do not get me wrong, there are some mines (bomblets) that have been used to soften up areas prior to an advance.  Most mines are to deny access or redirect a conventional force into a kill zone.  IEDs are not only kitchen made, their intended purpose is quite different than a conventional mine."
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,SeveredLimb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"To redirect the flow of a force, that's some smart shit. But a soldier/vehicle would have to step on one to know there is a minefield ahead. I guess they learn and radio it in pretty quick tho, so I can see that effect happening. I still don't get it though--they're basically the same thing. I can see a (cheap) army using IEDs to create a mine field to direct the enemy into a kill zone, no?"
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:56:14 2015 UTC,"IEDs are buried, hidden in trash, stuffed inside of dead animals...  Modern conventional mines are launched from minelayers or dropped from planes on top of the surface.  Most have an expiration as well and deactivate.    The old school burying mines for someone to step on, like toe-poppers or bouncing bettys? I don't think they're a thing anymore."

CombatFootage,3d3w6a,__loki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:32:47 2015 UTC,They buried a massive amount of mines all over the former Yugoslavia.   They are still struggling to clean them up 15+ years later.  Those old school mines are more dangerous to civilians than a conventional army.
CombatFootage,3d3w6a,SeveredLimb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of 'real' mines being used which are simply called IEDs because that's the popular, catch all phrase.  Plenty of mines were ""professionally"" made (think of the Iranian EFPs which bedeviled American forces in the later parts of the occupation of Iraq or the plethora of left over Soviet era anti-tank mines which insurgents used) yet they were still called IEDs.  If they were made in a factory and they performed as intended, how exactly are they improvised?  A mine is an explosive which has been placed in, on or near the ground with the purpose of exploding and damaging the enemy (be it a fixed position, personnel or a vehicle).  If you want to call a few 122mm artillery shells which have been wired together and buried an improvised explosive device, fine.  Everything that is in the ground and blows up is not an IED though."

One method of theirs was to have the rocket teams set up and orient the launchers in the late day and leave. Then the rocketmen would later bring in the 122's and place them on the rails, set timers on them and leave. The rockets would begin their barrage once the timers reached their assigned time. The rockets would be volley firing, doing their thing but not a sole enemy soldier near the launch area. So, when the american counter battery fire arrived there were no VC around, just  the cheap ass easily replaced launchers getting blown up.   You had to admire that kind of thinking. Sometimes though it didn't go their way and they'd get caught out setting up the launchers and be decimated."

At first my phone wasn't displaying the actual emergency text either, so I started flipping out that the world was ending. After a few minutes, I was calm, and somewhat annoyed that I had been woken up for what turned out to be an amber alert 5+ hours away on the other side of the state.   Additionally, that tone did nothing to help me be calm during a tiny tornado outbreak when they decided to send out new alerts on a constant basis. Nothing worse than sitting in the dark with the power out listening to the wind outside and my phone playing the sound of doom."

CombatFootage,3d075j,Pointwest418,26,Sun Jul 12 18:16:45 2015 UTC,They use 20mm HEIT-SD rounds which explode on impact or tracer burnout (to prevent collateral damage) and automatically track incoming projectiles with radar and FLIR

CombatFootage,3d075j,AmericanGeezus,3,Sun Jul 12 22:31:15 2015 UTC,Has it ever happened that they have targeted and shot down birds?
CombatFootage,3d075j,Tocho98,7,Mon Jul 13 00:59:34 2015 UTC,I would imagine there's probably some parameters targets have to meet like be going at or above a certain speed or having a trajectory that will make them land within the base.

CombatFootage,3d075j,jamiestewart48,4,Sun Jul 12 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. Mortars are relatively slow, and follow dumb projectile motion. With good radar, a HS student, given 20 min, could solve the equations. Computerized of course"
CombatFootage,3d075j,elosoloco,16,Sun Jul 12 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"Ehh projectie motion is easy in a vaccum but in a real atmosphere things get tricky and uunstable fast and you can't solve for proper solutions. Hell, as a entire species the best we can do is numeric approximations (There's a million dollar bounty for proving that a solution to the Navier Stokes Equation even exists). So it's actually harder to track slow moving light-ish objects as they carry far less momentum so the random-ish impacts of turbulence are much larger on their trajectory. If you are trying to hit an object with another object you have to aim where they are going to be in the future and to do that you have to have the ability to predict it's movements. It's much easier to guess where a 2 ton anti-ship missile going mach 3 is going to be in a second than a 120mm projectile going subsonic. Not only is the AShM a much bigger target to hit it's also carrying much more momentum severely limiting how much it's course can change in a given time period."

CombatFootage,3d075j,uconnhusky,8,Mon Jul 13 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"He's making a joke.  In this case:  Tracers are basically bullets that are on fire (which makes them easy to see in the dark, and even visible to a lesser extent in the light).  Eventually the fire goes out/burns out.  These guns use bullets (actually closer to small bombs) that are timed to explode at the same time as the fire goes out."
CombatFootage,3d075j,Grain_Man,3,Mon Jul 13 03:24:18 2015 UTC,Oh wow thank you!  Makes much more sense now.
CombatFootage,3d075j,uconnhusky,2,Mon Jul 13 09:48:35 2015 UTC,"whoosh  He's being sarcastic. Tracer burnout in this context means the projectiles are set to explode at a certain point in time after they are fired. Or ""when the tracer burns out"""
CombatFootage,3d075j,Rollondger,29,Mon Jul 13 03:31:07 2015 UTC,No. This is being filmed from the perspective of a gun crew. He is screaming for them to load HE rounds because they will soon have a POO (Point of Origin) that they will be shooting on.

CombatFootage,3d075j,AmericanGeezus,-6,Sun Jul 12 22:34:37 2015 UTC,"How do you use a 20mm shell for indirect fire mission? See how straight it goes in the air and how fast it is?  The C-RAM isn't an artillery piece, that's why I'm asking how would it be possible at all to fire a 20mm shell indirectly.  Most mortars have a range of around 3kms or so - arcing icluded. A 20mm shell travels 5kms with ease. I wouldn't be surprised if it went even further.  It's like as if I told someone to use the Hummwee as an artillery. Point the .50 up and hope to hit a target 10km away?"
CombatFootage,3d075j,malacovics,22,Sun Jul 12 22:36:51 2015 UTC,The guys in the video are probably  normal artillery.

The Centurion also has a thermal camera as well. Then it does some math and shoots off a shit ton of rounds at a point in the sky where it will most likely intercept the incoming mortar.  There is some argument that gun type C-RAM systems like Centurion are much more effective than rocket based systems like Sea-RAM (I know, confusing) and Iron Dome because they rely on impact with the incoming round, with a higher number of potential impacts, than rockets, which tend to try and use a warhead to knock the incoming round out of the sky without actually impacting. There is a good article by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists on how Iron Domes effectiveness has probably been drastically overstated by Israel."

If so, chances are hearing gunshots at night was not an uncommon occurrence and they were bound to be near or witness at least one murder, big robbery, etc.  Eventually though people get used hearing gunshots all the time or constantly hearing about/seeing local crime.  Boot camp for the military is somewhat similar as it prepares you for getting shot at on the field.  You get used to high stress situations.  A movie in my opinion that demonstrates what happens when someone isn't accustomed to an environment is rapidly introduced is ""Fury.""  Spoilers of course, but the main character fails to function appropriately at the beginning because he's not prepared for the environment he's placed and someone gets killed due to a failure caused by his nervousness.  He was a typist immediately moved to a tank operation's machine gun.  The failure happened because the leadership never took the steps necessary to make sure that he's somewhat used to the abuse and able to work in the environment.  In fact, the leader of the tank crew only takes the initiative to do so after someone dies due to the main character's nerves and a subsequent poor showing.  If you're used to an environment, chances are you won't be put off by something in it that's a regular occurrence.  Even if it's extremely brutal.  In this case, the guys in the video have probably seen or participated in firefights, executions, and all sorts of atrocities.  They've probably been living in constant violence for months, if not years."

CombatFootage,3cxqub,M21A1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:33:14 2015 UTC,"I had posted this to /r/MilitaryPorn:  More details from here:   Captain Robert M. Elliot was assigned to the 34th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Korat Airbase in southern Thailand. On Valentine's Day 1968, Elliot was the pilot of an F105D fighter jet assigned a combat mission near Hanoi, North Vietnam.  The F105 Thunderchief (""Thud""), in its various versions, flew more missions against North Vietnam than any other U.S. aircraft. It also suffered more losses, partially due to its vulnerability, which was constantly under revision. Between 1965 and 1971, the aircraft was equipped with armor plate, a secondary flight control system, an improved pilot ejection seat, a more precise navigation system, better blind bombing capability and ECM pods for the wings. While the D version was a single-place aircraft, the F model carried a second crewman which made it well suited for the role of suppressing North Vietnam's missile defenses.  Eighty-six F-105Ds fitted with radar homing and warning gear formed the backbone of the Wild Weasel program, initiated in 1965 to improve the Air Force's electronic warfare capability. Upon pinpointing the radar at a missile site, the Wild Weasel attacked with Shrike missiles that homed on radar emissions. The versatile aircraft was also credited with downing 25 Russian MiGs. Thirteen of these modified F's were sent to Southeast Asia in 1966.  Capt. Elliot's Thunderchief was number two in a flight of four. The flight was to make successive runs on their target near Hanoi. As Elliot was pulling off the target during one of his planned runs, his aircraft was hit by hostile fire. He radioed that he was hit, but the rest of the flight did not see any parachute or hear emergency beeper signals indicating that he was able to eject from the aircraft. Elliot was declared Missing in Action."
CombatFootage,3cxqub,Wartz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:17:51 2015 UTC,"What those guys in Vietnam went through; in the beginning they did not even have tactics or ECM equipment to deal with threats like the SA-2, imagine a war in Europe in the 60's.  Even more horrific is the casualty rate of the Wild Weasels, I need to dig it up but if memory serves within the F-100 equipped unit it was something like 60 or 70% and overall it was around 55% or so.  That is more than double and approaching tripple in the F-100 weasen case of the 8th AF casualty rate in WWII."
CombatFootage,3cxqub,M21A1,16,Tue Jul 14 03:16:23 2015 UTC,"F-105s AKA ThunderChiefs took horrific casualties over Vietnam. The initial production run of the jets was all but destroyed thru action, accidents and wear tear. No aircraft in history has had its initial production run destroyed. They were designed to penetrate Soviet airspace and lob nukes at sites. Their speed was good but fully laden with bombs and used as conventional bomber over Vietnam at altitude showed how extremely vulnerable they were even with ECM, and fighter packets escorting them. They were used also used as the 1st counter to SAMs systems. Wild Weasels dancing with Radar operators baiting to launch or show themselves to fire HARM missiles to take out sites. This took balls to bait SAM operators to fire SAMs at them but also ""Paint"" them so play a cat and mouse game on spotting the sites."

CombatFootage,3cxqub,ckfinite,5,Sun Jul 12 00:17:38 2015 UTC,This is why people claiming the A-10 or the F-16 will be better strike fighters than the F-35 make me laugh my ass off.
CombatFootage,3cxqub,M21A1,4,Sun Jul 12 03:47:42 2015 UTC,Ehh.....   im torn.     The f-35 will be a good plane but its going to break all the time and if it does take damage it wont be able to keep trucking like an a10.    The a10 can be filled with hole and missing part of a wing and still land safely.         But its an easy target for modern threats.          Then again an ac-130 is probably the easiest target in the af and we haven't lost one since 93
CombatFootage,3cxqub,ckfinite,3,Sun Jul 12 12:29:41 2015 UTC,"Why would it break all the time? There is no reason to believe that once the F-35 completes its shakedown and testing phase that it will not be a reliable plane.  The A-10 is not actually ""tougher"" than other planes. It just protects the pilot better than other airframes from one very specific threat. 20mm or less small arms fire. In ANY sort of air environment that has SAMs, A-10s get grounded. (Unless you want to see a repeat of the vietnam debacle!)  These days, small 500lb laser or GPS guided bomblets are much more effective than the GAU at proper CAS. Small guided bombs can be designed with shaped charges and dropped from high altitude into a specific house or ditch with minimal surrounding destruction. The GAU is unaimed, has a wide area of destruction and requires the pilot to come in low and slow, a perfect target for a shoulder launched missile.  These days F-15s, F-16s and F-18s do the large majority of CAS strikes. Heck even in the original invasions of Iraq the media-famous A-10 did not contribute anything out of the ordinary and got the majority of its claimed tank kills with missiles, not the gun or bombs.   The F-35 carries a 17,000 lb bomb load with a 650 nautical mile combat radius on internal fuel, better than any of the above listed fighters. It's also stealthy and can carry 2 2000lb bombs, 4 1000lbs, or 8 500lbers (all guided) into a high threat environment and actually survive, unlike the A-10.  The A-10 DOES have a 50k lb bomb load and can fly for 250nmi in circles over a target area, but it can't do much else."
CombatFootage,3cxqub,dragon_nipples,2,Sun Jul 12 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"50k lb bomb load   16,000lbs actually. 50,000lbs is for the B-1B."

CombatFootage,3cxqub,CRU-60,2,Sun Jul 12 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"me i know guys that have had sams launched while working with a10s.   A-10s were grounded in ODS after the Iraqi Republican Guard's Strela-1s ate them up.  From Gen. Horner, the CENTAF commander:   Quite frankly, we pulled the A-10s back from going up around the Republican Guard and kept them on Iraq's [less formidable] front-line units. That's line if you have a force that allows you to do that. In this case, we had F-16s to go after the Republican Guard.   A-10's have faced MANPADS in service, but those that are present in the Middle East have some issues. The biggest are that they're old (20 year service life - and a lot were built before 1995), and that the operational requirements of MANPADS are rather beyond what's available to the average insurgent, which when combined with insufficient training leads them to be a lot less effective than they would be in a fully worked up environment.  What's more, we're not talking primarily about MANPADS here, we're talking about modern MRSAMS like Buk and S-300. While an A-10 can fly above the hazard region for a MANPADS, it can't for an MRSAM, against which it has very few defences."

Instead they ran into F-4 flights flying in similar formation, patterns and even radio frequencies,which turned the tables on them.  From what i remember reading from accounts was that most pilots had a healthy respect for 21s some as far went to say they it was better fighter over F-4s. But for the most part 21s were rare and most simply preferred to fire all their missiles and a head for home instead of engaging. All if not all 21s were station over Hanoi in defense countering B-52s."

Our watching is an unintended consequence. I believe the videos we watch are created for a very specific agenda."

EDIT: I want to say that i am so vocal about this because i once was trained as part of a tank crew, so this situation leaves me kinda itchy, but i have to admit that the climate i have trained in wasn't as dry as this and thus our tanks would probbaly not cause that much dust with every shot.

Apparently whoever he spoke to reported it to their superiors.  Why? In the doco one of the soldiers throws a grenade and fires his rifle into the Taliban. IIRC he says something along the lines of ""There were like 3 in there I shot them all"", or something to that effect. Basically he's saying ""I finished them off"", and as we all know, the Geneva Convention dictates that you can't 'finish off' wounded enemy combatants. Their commander grills them all opsec and claims that the unit/men involved could be up for war crimes.  In the end I don't think anyone got in trouble for it.
