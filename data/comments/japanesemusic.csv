japanesemusic,3e4w9q,agentoneal,3,Tue Jul 21 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"What kind of Japanese vinyl are you looking for? Japanese pressings or Japanese music?  My usual go-to for sellers online is Otokichi Premium. Specializing in mostly Japanese music with some Japanese pressings of western music as well as CDs and lots of anime and game related media.  Snow Records is another online seller that deals with Japanese pressings more often.  Another seller is Disc Legend, which has an even balance of the two generally, but is pricier.  Hope that helps give you some idea. There may be other sellers, but these three are the ones I know off the top of my head."

japanesemusic,3e4w9q,Malemocynt,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, those might be tough to find in general as, like in the West, vinyl in Japan stopped being mass-produced after 1989, so a lot of stuff since then were pretty limited in general, if non-existent on vinyl, like 90s Visual Kei."

And outside of the tracks included in the compilation albums, try Can I Have A Word from PLAYER, and the singles of Wave Runner and CAPS LOCK."

japanesemusic,3bw2eg,M1n1f1g,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:22:20 2015 UTC,"London Japan Night. They were great, but the crowd wasn't warmed up. The following acts were made to sound dull in comparison."
japanesemusic,3bw2eg,iNobSandwich,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:31:53 2015 UTC,My favorite band :)
japanesemusic,3bwg3d,Clypeus,2,Thu Jul 2 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"I love them, I really wish I could see them play live!! She is so insanely cute."
japanesemusic,3bw0zh,BaBopByeYa,4,Thu Jul 2 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"Soko Ni Naru might be right up your alley. Unfortunately, they're still pretty new and haven't released much material yet."

japanesemusic,3bw0zh,heurim,2,Tue Jul 7 22:24:11 2015 UTC,My rec for math rock would be tricot :)
japanesemusic,3bw0zh,M1n1f1g,3,Fri Jul 3 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"I was going to mention tricot, too. Much lighter than Ling, and they take a bit of getting used to, but they have a good sound. All of their songs are on Spotify, too (except the extended drum solo version of Niwa and a few live performances)."

japanesemusic,3bqdy6,Ansalem,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:31:50 2015 UTC,"They really rewrote this song from the live version. The melody line is the same but the instrumentals are completely different. I think the older version was better. I'd link to it, but looks like they deleted the old video from youtube..."
