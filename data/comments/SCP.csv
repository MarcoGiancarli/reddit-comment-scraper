SCP,3e0dz0,theporkroll,9,Tue Jul 21 00:06:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I actually like that undefined quality. Reality anchors are a really interesting addition to the universe, allowing them to have stories with reality benders where we aren't just entirely at their mercy. As it stands, the possibilities are endless when it comes to writing about fighting reality benders; since the anchors haven't been defined at all, you can write a tale using them however you want, and giving them whatever properties or limitations you want. By defining the anchors, you make the possibilities very narrow."
SCP,3e0dz0,niceguysociopath,3,Tue Jul 21 01:59:01 2015 UTC,"I partially agree. I love that having SRAs undefined allows other authors to apply their own artistic license in using them.   However, I'd argue it makes for a less interesting device. Right now you can summarize anchors as ""things that stop reality bending."" What are the downsides? What happens when you hang around an SRA for too long? Does it interfere with my cellphone signal? Will it destroy the pocket dimension of that old man SCP?  Way back, every SCP and their mother had telekill alloy somewhere in their containment procedures. Thankfully that's changed, since people realized Telekill alloy hinders mental functions so site directors need to use it more carefully. I'm concerned that, similarly, authors will use reality anchors in plain ways (ex. SCP-9000 needs to be placed in an enclosure of 500 Scranton Reality Anchors arranged in a pentagram!) without additional details, but most SCP authors are an entertaining bunch smart enough to avoid this.  Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of reality anchors, and they were introduced in an interesting way. I'd just love even more exploration into the intricacies of using them."

In my headcanon, SRAs are enormous structures that act as a final line of defense against reality benders -- something that has to be buried in the ground. They're also ridiculously expensive and complex to create, hence the 2000 site being the only place to have them. If you absolutely, positively have to protect a place that could single handedly restore the human species, then you go for the SRAs."

SCP,3e0dz0,GhrabThaar,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:33 2015 UTC,"There Is No Canon and all that.  My reading works like this: SRA's create an ontologically enclosed system, like dropping a bucket in a swimming pool. Afterwards, you can drain the pool, but the segment of the pool contained in the bucket is still there. As such, an array of SRA's are designed and intended to keep a segment of the larger reality intact as a separate system from the rest, and to ensure it proceeds along the course of events as they were when the anchored pocket of reality was established.  Continuing with this analogy, you can imply further potential problems from a few different sources.  1) Outside the bucket.  Since the bucket is a closed system, you'd better make damn sure it has everything you need in there. Consider Site-64T from SCP-2400. When isolated, 2400-A is essentially an asynchronous anchored reality. Look who is approved to work there, and why. Then think what would happen if a catastrophe occurred on our side, and what else would happen when workers in 64T had to cope long-term with that isolation, or worse - deal with the aftermath.  2) REALLY outside the bucket.  An unknown universal constant acts on the bucket and everything else. In my crude analogy, a meteor falls on the pool and the bucket, destroying both. My theory about one of the scenarios in SCP-2003 is explained this way. In scenario XJ, I believe K-failsafe Protocol Twelve involved SRA's as emergency containment for the SCP in question. As an attempt to avert some unknown failure, a temporal paradox was created that collapsed spacetime. If SRA's were used, the inability of causality to reconcile what should have happened with what the anchored reality attempted to make happen broke causality and the universe at large.  3) Inside the bucket.  If there's a problem contained with SRA's, the pocket ontological universe MUST include those SRA's. As such, YK-events can't be feasibly contained this way. SCP-319 currently (barely) contains an expanding vacuum metastability collapse. Sealing that into its own ontological pocket with SRA's would still end up with the death of physics unraveling the SRA's themselves, followed by everything else. There's basically a godzilla threshold that reality warpers must cross to circumvent SRA's in that fashion, but presumably it does exist given enough knowledge and determination.  Solidarty's existentialist bombs.  Weaponizing reality anchors presumably means establishing an ontological pocket where users from the outside can determine the parameters of the universe inside. In essence, this makes us reality warpers. Whoever made those things were obviously far more advanced than we are, and such a user's manual would be obscenely complex. Likely more complex than the rudimentary translation field could handle. No way we're touching that unless everything else failed. God is strong here. There's just too much to risk pushing the wrong button, for the reasons outlined above."

I wish I could go somewhere where this movie couldn't possibly affect me.""  The terror behind reality benders is the sheer power that they possess. They are the ultimate, unstoppable being, and we have no way of ever possibly knowing exactly what effects they have had on the world. The Foundation needs to go to greats lengths, both ethically and financially, to contain them, and they have in the past.

Document 2000-SS-EX: The following information establishes basic operational parameters of technology developed specifically for the SCP-2000 project. Although this technology may appear to be anomalous, it is based entirely on verifiable scientific principles currently in use by the Foundation to effect containment.  The invention of the Scranton Reality Anchor (SRA) appears to pre-date the first activation of SCP-2000, and is credited to Dr. Robert Scranton in 1889. The main body and much of the circuitry of the SRA are constructed of a corrosion resistant beryllium bronze alloy. Inspired by artifacts recovered [DATA EXPUNGED], effectively eliminating the appearance of virtual particle/anti-particle pairs required for Type Green reality bending phenomena to manifest. Due to the expense involved in producing the beryllium bronze alloy required for the SRA’s construction, Foundation-wide implementation of the device has been limited to units capable of an area of effect less than two cubic meters[1].   2722 has weaponized SRAs, mentioned in the recovered materials section.  2343 also uses them, but I haven't really read this SCP yet."

The Foundation contains everything from phones that talk to nonexistant operators to a literal angel of the lord almighty.    The fact that there are several actual biblical myths in containment also lends a bit of weight to Judeo-Christian symbology. But do not forget that the Foundation has also contained several items of the mythology of other religions as well.    It's likely because Judeochristian symbology has more apocalyptic connotations to it than other religions', which is in keeping with the nature of SCP containment, and the tone that writers on the site generally want for their work."

SCP,3dr4ru,NobleKale,5,Sun Jul 19 12:57:50 2015 UTC,That's what I said. Euclids require observation because they are an unknown factor that cannot be left alone.

The best description I've seen of it is ""objects that are integral to normalcy or potentially crucial to furthering the Foundation's goals"".  They're very hard to write well, and there aren't many. The ones I can think of offhand are a warning system for extraterrestrial threats targeting Earth, a universal escape pod that we can use to send people into alternate realities, and the Solidarity, a spacecraft that's been passed around by dozens of alternate Foundations that protects civilizations in their time of need. It's always been critically useful, never been fully understood, and we now have it in orbit, waiting for an unknown crisis.  EDIT: Ugh, and 2000. How could I forget that one?"

Keter: Forcefully shove that shit in a box. Make sure it's a strong fucking box. Make sure that box can take a lot of punishment. Never open the box. Keep many D-Class around the box for canon fodder. As long as you don't open the box and what ever is in the box stays there you're good. If not then the world might end. Not a lot of middle ground there.   Thaumiel: This is a Skip as well as a box. It doesn't really need a box, it is the box. It hold the things that kill all the people. It can hold the big bads. It can fix the messes that the big bads make. Its a really good box, it's the best box we have. Love this box. Treasure this box. This box just might save everything.   Appolyon: There is not a box big enough or strong enough to hold it. It's gonna kill everything. For now the box that someone way smarter than us is holding but it will fail. And then we will die.

That second one is just-plain-keter. I fail to see how some fatass demon is worse than that.  Check out SCP-319 for details."
SCP,3dr4ru,GhrabThaar,10,Sun Jul 19 00:41:11 2015 UTC,"Technically, I believe it's meant to be an allusion go 231. Both are done by the same author as well I think.  If I remember, 231 had seven different people. Six of them died and resulted in some situation that was terrible enough to be both redacted and given its own name.

Whatever Montauk is, it's supposed to be worse than anything the reader can imagine. It's worse than rape. It's worse than child rape and torture. It's worse than anything a sane mind can think of. That's what the Foundation is willing to do.  Addendum 231-c says that Procedure 110-Montauk has become less effective due to the subject becoming desensitized to it, and suggests either deveoloping new procedures with higher emotional response, or using amnistics to reset the subject to baseline between enactments of 110-Montauk. I take this to mean that Montauk doesn't require any specific actions; its purpose is the emotional response it evokes. That emotional response is what keeps the pregnant child from giving birth to a reality-destroying monster.  Alternately, the victim of 110-Montauk may also be a blue whale."
SCP,3dr4ru,tgjer,4,Sun Jul 19 04:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, also it does sort of say she's a child in the actual SCP. It says her age is between [BLANK] and [BLANK][BLANK] insinuating that shes around 10 years old."

SCP,3dr4ru,The-Paranoid-Android,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:53 2015 UTC,I believe the implication is that the demon is so powerful it can destroy through alternate realities or even destroy reality itself (implied by the fact that we can't just blow up the entrance to its dimension) so a super-keter class is justified. There is absolutely no escape or defense whatsoever.

Thaumiels are juuuuust predictable enough to be used in containment, when something is so weird and-or reality end-y you have to use another weird thing to keep it in."
SCP,3dr4ru,Fastfish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about boxes, but from what I understand Thaumiels are SCPs that can be used to to restore or prevent the extinction of humanity, or the destruction of the universe, in the case of an end-of-the-world scenario."

SCP,3dqyfa,Djoric,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"More GOI stuff is always good, because moar.  Headcanon spew:  The HI is a pretty lofty organization with very lofty ideals that are going to, by nature, fall flat because of people on occasion. Dogmatic conflicts will arise, so there needs to be some method for quickly, decisively, non-violently sorting out disputes in the field.  That said, I see them as very welcoming to people who want to do the Right Thing, with flexibility on the reasons behind it. Along with holy text scholars and the like, they'd probably be willing to let a few Indiana Jones-type folks be consultants or informants... maybe even limited operatives. As such, the vital documentation needs to be as concise and dogma-neutral as possible, so people with basic knowledge of HI practices can intervene if necessary, regardless of personal faith (or lack thereof).  Practically, I'm saying this because I'm no Abrahamic scholar, nor should I need to be to enjoy the articles. I have seen one or two old-series SCP's based around a twist on some scripture that I was unfamiliar with and didn't want to look up. That kind of thing can be off-putting and the HI at large can foster similar styling. References are fine, but every agent shouldn't need to carry a pack full of different printings of each holy book to cross-reference stuff all the time. Maybe encourage references to be spelled out in the documentation where needed?  Also, what is the primary purpose of the organization in this hub? Scholarly research? Theological debate? Hoarding stuff from the heathens?"
SCP,3dqyfa,GhrabThaar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yep. Most of the stuff you have in your first two paragraphs is part and parcel for the group already, so no worries on that.  The practical part is of course where all the hiccups are. I always worry that the scholarly emphasis in the actual writing of the articles will kill this project before it starts, and I don't know how to go around that.  Because while it shouldn't be necessary to have an actual background in historical / religious scholarship to write and enjoy the articles I hope to have here, they kinda do need a more rigorous research background. The site doesn't have a supremely good background with religious / historical scips, since most of the writing base is not in those fields. I am rather stumped on how to address this.  Outside references would be used so that pertinent information would still be in the article, since many of them would be to documents that don't actually exist (ie, A scribe referencing another scribe's work)   Also, what is the primary purpose of the organization in this hub?   Same as it's always been: all three of those things, plus dealing with all those angels and demons and weird old gods, trying to put together a more accurate picture of the universe and how it works, and undermining more dangerous anomalous religious groups"

To me it'd be interesting to see how the HI distinguishes between anomalous and non-anomalous religions.  Because real world (hence non-anomalous) religious people do believe that things have existed that break the laws of physics - flying horses, multiplying bread, pillars of salt and fire and God knows what else - so what sets apart 'non-anomalous' Islam and Christianity in-universe from 'anomalous' religions like Fifthism or the Broken Church?"

SCP,3dkgup,vicabart,6,Fri Jul 17 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"Dr. [Redacted] was approached during his morning jog by a large entity comprised of various objects,tools and plant life. It would not speak but only wave, above is the picture of the creature taken at the time of the encounter.   It's only means of communication at the time was tapping on the fence using morse code, how it even had knowledge of using morse code was astounding. Dr. [Redacted] began communicating with the creature by verbally speaking with it, and it would respond in morse code. According to it, it didnt know who where it was or what it was. Saying that it had only woke up recently. The location where it was located was abandoned and there were no witnesses. The creature has no intention of harming others but simply wants to know its purpose.   Dr. [Redacted] escorted the entity back to site 17 where it was contained on site but free to roam the compound. During a containment breach the creature sacrificed its life to save a group of scientists and security who were in danger of SCP-1048-C and SCP-1048-C-1, SCP-1048-C-2. It was unknown as to why The SCP's attacked site 17 but we believe it had to do with the attempted recovery of the newly acquired entity in question. During the attack the entity showed signs of telekinesis and attracted more and more objects to build itself to hulk up. During this time it had attatched a loud speaker to its head and began to speak audibly expressing its concern for the scientists and keeping everyone behind it and safe. The SCP's began to fight with the entity which lasted about 45 Minutes, during which time SCP-1048-C-2 and SCP-1048-C-1 were destroyed. SCP-1048-C began it's self destruct sequence to destroy everything within the vicinity. At which time the entity used its abilities to absorb SCP-1048-1 and 2 and created a shell to contain the blast, which both saved the scientists and security resulting in site 17's first...0 casualties incident. The entity was completely blown apart save for its head which was stored in vault for further study. There were many objections to this from both staff and even security, even leveraging that they could team it up with Abel or even create a new elite unit for internal security only. However due to the state of the Entity which is now labeled SCP-3100, there was nothing to debate since it was now dead. A few days later loud noises and banging was heard coming from the vault and it triggered motion sensors and security. A security team quickly surrounded the vault and Dr. [Redacted] opened the vault to reveal the newly formed entity which was now compromised of a more aesthetically pleasing body and apparently able to construct the objects to act as living matter, this was noted when Dr [Redacted] shook SCP-3100's hand and thanking it for saving his life. It did not remember anything after the explosion but immediately wanted to know if everyone was ok after the incident. Dr. [Redacted] informed the entity that it was nearly a week since the incident and it saved many lives including his own.   The entity is now part of site 17's security team and is free to wander the compound but its to be contained within the compound at all times. It has expressed no desire to leave after understanding what the foundation does, and wishes to partake in saving others like itself and rehabilitating those who currently have a pending status to Euclid from Safe. It has been known to spend a majority of its time with SCP-131 and SCP-999 and playing chess with Dr. [Redacted]. On a side note, Dr. Bright has requested a transfer to site 17 after news within the foundation had spread, but it was rejected...for obvious reasons."

SCP,3dhgqx,Elick320,6,Thu Jul 16 17:13:24 2015 UTC,The Foundation does get funding from the major governments of the world. One tour of any of the more...lively sites is enough to convince any general to slip them into the defense budget. That comes coupled with a promise to share any non-anomalous breakthroughs in technology (particularly weapons technology) brought about by SCP study. The Foundation makes sure to share the technology evenly to keep nations even with their peers and in a state of detente - containment is hard enough without military conflict getting in the way.

SCP,3dg5il,Euloque,5,Thu Jul 16 00:31:57 2015 UTC,"One of the main points of SCP is the simple premise ""There is no canon."" When you write a tale, you can do basically anything you like. Many are the tales wherein new concepts are introduced, existing SCPs are destroyed, or even contradiction of the SCP article that it was based on. For example, see Revised Entry, which does all three. In this, 173 develops the ability to duplicate (endlessly) and kills everyone (even 682, something basically impossible).  So canon is what you make it.  Now, as to your questions:  1) I doubt it. D-class are explicitly stated to be an expendable resource, drawn from criminals convicted of violent crimes. Many are from death row (that is, awaiting execution). So to upgrade them would be very odd. The Foundation is also in the habit of dehumanizing everyone (especially D-class) and likely wouldn't notice save a small note in their file. Sorry. Then again, almost all Agents are willing to die (and know they stand a good chance to) in order to complete their mission. Very Suicide Squaddy.  2) The Foundation is very pragmatic, but generally avoids using anomalous artifacts unless necessary. They may outfit agents with specific tools or enhancements for a specific task, but systemic ""upgrading"" is likely outside of their philosophy. On the other hand, an orbital bombardment system is both practical and in-character for the Foundation.  Remember, there is no canon, so you can do as you like. But it might not be received very well if it deviates too far from the canon. On the other hand, there are lots of other ""pseudo-Foundations"" whose philosophies would work well with what you're looking for. The GOI, for instance."

SCP,3dg5il,PM_ME_YOUR_CHURCH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:33:17 2015 UTC,I remember that tale. Can't remember what the orbiting weapon part was but my thought is what it there was a meter class that needed something as potent as a laser with the force of a meteor crashing in to it to neutralize of at least weaken enough to contain. The tale takes.place over a desert so the cover story would be a meteor exploded before impact which has happened before so the public would believe it plausible.

Stored weapons appear to be similar to the Teller–Ulam design, although initial studies indicate that enhancement with SCP-███ or similar substances may have [DATA EXPUNGED]everal orders of magnitude.

""Its"" not ""it's""—no such thing as the possessive apostrophe containment may be breached, not lost stationed stay consistent on numbering and writing out the word: you switch from ""one (1)"" to just ""3 times a day"" super redundant second sentence. It should just read ""appears to exert a cognitohazardous effect"" or something like that rather than repeating words over and over. Generally if you use the same word twice in a sentence it's redundant. persons affected be precise in your description. ""As needed"" is vague and uninformative. ""items secondary effects"" should be changed to ""experience the second set of anomalous effects"" or the like. the interview doesn't really fit with the tone of the article, add anything, or expand on the history. For that matter, the history is a bit odd.   I apologize for nitpicking this much. But honestly, and not to be offensive, this is not a very interesting idea. It's a pack of cards that makes people want to play solitaire. If there was a twist or fridge horror, that might redeem it, but people playing endlessly until they die is trite and has been done to death (if you'll pardon the pun).   Alternatively, you could hint at other things to make it scary. See the SCP where a screw sets off reality breach alarms as a Keter threat. It's an innocuous-sounding idea, but the implications one can draw from it make it scary. The comments on that page may also help you.  I'm sorry to say it, but without a overhaul, this is not, in my opinion, SCP material. Don't let this discourage you from writing SCPs; just use this to learn and make the next one better!

A memetic hazard is one that must be understood to affect you—an idea, a painting, a song, etc. Cognitohazards simply institute compulsions or the like.  For example, a painting that compels people to add to it would be a cognitohazard. A phrase that, when heard and understood, causes anomalous effects would be a memetic hazard.  And keep in mind, my criticism is just my opinion—it's entirely possible I'm way off base. You might also go for a more ""mundane"" artifact—see the Little Caesar's pizza box.

Itays both touch and visual contact spread it but in the next sentence implies only visual contact is needed. ""[persons affected] are known as"" should be ""are hereby designated"" ""come under the item's secondary effects"" ""premature terminations of three d-class"" should be changed to ""deaths of three d-class."" It's only 'termination' if the Foundation authorizes it. Just a strange little quirk of the files. the second sentence of the first addendum is a massive run-on sentence. Try changing it to something like this:    Due to suspicion of anomalous activity, analysis of security footage surrounding the event confirmed the deck of cards to be the source. The artifact was immediately confiscated and desinated SCP-2XXX.    addendum two is unclear. Does ""showing signs of boredom"" merely mean yawning on the job or is it a habitual inactivity? What's the range? How does it ""call out""?   You've cleaned up most (almost all) of the errors, which is good. You mentioned earlier that you are doing this without spellcheck, which is impressive in and of itself. So for protocol and grammar you're doing pretty well.  As for the actual content, I feel I should clarify the position I hold. No article has to be scary, nor does an article have to be some grandiose work of subtle horror, epic implication, or elegant satire. Each piece is unique, and reflects an author's style. But the one thing that almost every single one has is it is unique. Unusual, unpredictable, and almost always has a ""hook."" Whether that hook comes in the form of psychological horror (173), the occult (616), the potentially useful (500), or just plain weird (184).  Finding what you want your article to convey will help you make it more ""punchy"" rather than being lukewarm or unforgettable. In the same vein, adding ""scary stuff"" or ""horror"" just to check off a box will not only water down the story you want to tell, but often make the article trite and stereotypical. Find what you want, write it, and cut out anything extraneous.   Do you want to have an odd little deck of cards that has an overzealous ""play with me"" effect emanating? Write that. Do you want an eldritch horror hiding in the guise of a stack of cards? Go for it. Do you want an alien game that humans don't quite understand? Your choice.  I think you've got the technical side out of the way, now all that remains is to find out what you want your overall idea to point towards. Does that make sense?"

Do more people=more happiness? Why do we know it is connected? I'm also not sure that people are getting happier overall. Maybe, but that doesn't seem like an easy thing to get everyone to accept as given. Also if it just keeps getting bigger regardless, why bother, and instead try another way of neutralizing it?"

We would know it's connected based on comparing global events nine years ago with the size. That might sound like a strange leap to make, but imagine you're a researcher on this thing: it's growing, could be dangerous, it's only a matter of time until someone finds out about it, and you have no clue how to control it. After years of this, you're definitely going to, at some point, say ""Well, the only way we could contain it at all is if our actions have some impact on it."" It's only a short leap to assume speed of light delay, and then looking at headlines from the associated time in the past wouldn't be too much of a leap either, considering these guys have years.  Originally, I did try to explain this more formally in the description, but it came across as rather superfluous and I didn't particularly like it, so I removed it.  And we are trying to find another way to control it. Because of the light-speed delay, we won't know if our containment works for nine years. If that fails, we're going to need a plan B."

This is actually because of his vast knowledge of the SCP foundation's secrets. He is so intimately aware of all the many ways in which mankind (and the entire universe) is so utterly and irreversibly screwed and doomed to end in any number of horrific ways, that he just doesn't see the point in telling anybody about it, rationalizing that ""ignorance is bliss"". And he's kind of right considering the fact that he has discovered that the inverse is very true (""knowing is hell""), for his knowledge of such circumstances has left him in a state of nihilistic depression. He doesn't see the point in sharing his knowledge, he doesn't see the point in leaving the foundation for the outside world, he doesn't really see the point in anything. And due to his vastly superior intellect, he is either unwilling or unable to ""delude"" himself with the notion of any kind of hope for the universe, as humans seem so eager to do, for he has ascertained beyond any reasonable doubt that any attempt to prevent or contain universal disaster is (to quote him directly) ""bollocks"".

This process may be used to place the body part in positions other than its original, or even to transfer it to a second subject. A transferred body part will assume its normal function- a transferred eye will reattach to a subject's nervous system to restore sight, and a mouth will be able to speak with its owner's voice despite missing its corresponding lungs, throat, and tongue.  If the jaws are opened when a pinched body part is not in contact with a subject, the body part will immediately vanish, amplifying the subject's emotional response. As the only way to end the subject's emotional response is returning a body part to its original position, researchers are encouraged to avoid experimentation along this line without a site supervisor's explicit approval."

All the SCP objects are created by human reality-bending abilities, to the point that Earth is saturated with the anomalous. If we aren't made slightly aware of the fact that we're powerful, we might wish our own abilities out of existence, wish the anomalous out of existence, with unknown ramifications for the rest of reality.

SCP,3ct98m,Gabmaia,24,Sat Jul 11 00:14:24 2015 UTC,"Here's an explanation from the author:   You've very nearly got it. Hypothetically speaking, lets say you had an advanced race of people on the verge of becoming psychic powerhouses, but were still immature. They were creating ""monsters from the Id"" just by thinking too hard about them. Fear of a giant evil sun. Fear of a statue that kills when you look away. It was creating a threat to the galaxy. You can't wipe the psychic race out, because if they learn your intentions they might think you into extinction. So instead you contain the race as best you can, wiping their memory of their place in the galactic stage, moving them home, and hoping that they stay put long enough to properly develop and cease being a threat. You can't convince them they're the only race in existence, because their power might alter reality to make it the truth. Goodbye all sentient alien races everywhere. You also can't fully convince them they don't have their powers anymore, because it might create some kind of paradox: if the power doesn't exist how could it destroy itself?  So you leave a handful of these psychics ""in the know."" You let them know what's up and they agree with your assessment: they needs to sit put and chill for another thousand years to get its head in the game, so to speak. A small group of psychics shall watch over things, to ensure that the species doesn't do anything catastrophic. You need to keep them from thinking aliens into extinction so you introduce a UFO, and suddenly people believe aliens exist. The rest of the galaxy is safe from obliteration. You don't want the race to convince itself its powers don't exist, so you introduce a ghost or a demon or a little girl with stars for eyes. You don't need these things to run rampant over the planet, that'd be dangerous. Just a few people exposed, here and there, who know enough to believe, and you've got yourself a psychic safety blanket. As long as the Indoctrination holds, the psychic race won't remember it used to be the next best thing to the God Emperor of the Imperium and start curb-stomping alien species with the power of their minds, strictly out of spite.  Secure humanity. Contain its power. Protect reality.  Does the Foundation catalog anomalies, or dangle them in front of our eyes like a carrot on a string?"

SCP,3ct98m,ksamson,6,Fri Jul 10 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"Basically humanity has immense reality-warping power, but we're caught between that point where we are truly transcendent and race ruled by base instincts. Our fears and uncontrolled desires created some nasty results in the greater galactic stage, so the galactic community decided we needed to be contained. A small elite (implied to be 05 Command and a group called ""the gentlemen"") was given self-containment authority over humankind.   Humanity's memories were suppressed and we believe it's 2015 and live outside the realms of intergalactic travel. But you can't just erase memories from a brain capable of thinking reality to obey it. Humanity strains subconsciously against containment and most of the anomalous events and entities the Foundation contains are creatures from our own minds manifesting.   SCP-2004 is nothing more than a remnant of our old technology, written in our old universal language. When we read it, the seals in our brains are broken and we remember who we used to be - and humanity did not go entirely willing into containment. When those minds are freed they try to free the rest of us and with their regained memories of advanced technology and reality-warping powers they could easily wreck the galaxy's shit.  But if humanity entirely forgets about their powers, the powers will erase themselves from existence. The Foundation uses a very delicate ""carrot and stick"" method to keep the gestalt alive, letting small numbers of humanity know about their true potential so that potential doesn't vanish. The goal is to ensure humanity remains contained but finds its enlightenment, becoming some kind of godlike force that leaves this reality for a new one of its own making. Otherwise mankind will probably wipe this reality (and itself) out.   And things aren't going so well, if you needed just a cursory glance at the newspaper. To say nothing of the increasing levels of Keter-class anomalies that keep popping up."

The machine dispensed a fluid, a dark yellowish-green in color, which effervesced and appeared to give off a vapor similar to that observed in the sublimation of dry ice. Subject drank what he called ""a single minuscule sip"" of the fluid; he later reported the taste as being somewhere between a gin and tonic, a margarita, and a glass of Scotch whisky. Upon swallowing, subject was seen to collapse. Dr. ██████ assisted subject to infirmary and asked for a description of symptoms. Subject reported a massive migraine-like headache, nausea, and mild disorientation, accompanied however by an incomparable feeling of euphoria. Aftereffects of euphoria and intoxication continued for 18 hours, during which time subject was under careful medical observation; aforementioned negative aftereffects also remained for 18 hours, after which time they worsened and persisted for an additional six hours. Subject requested a dose of SCP-500; request was denied and he was given Excedrin instead. Subject promptly consumed entire bottle of Excedrin. Despite Dr. ██████'s expectations, subject suffered absolutely no deleterious effects from overdose of acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid; subject instead reported prompt cessation of ""hangover"" within ten minutes of consumption. It is theorized that massive overconsumption of pain relievers is precisely what is necessary to counteract the ill effects of a ██████-███████. The fluid in question has been taken under study. Approximately 14 as yet unidentified compounds have been isolated, although not without some difficulty, as the liquid seems to react violently to metallic instruments; its effects on glass or — as subject's case shows — flesh are negligible, but it reacts as though it were an acid when it comes into contact with metal.

I'd LOVE a multi-part with 093, though. It's one of my favorite SCPs.

In addition to what /u/cebbers18 said about having SCP-073 help out, there could be cameos like SCP-085, or having SCP-____-J in a box on the main character's desk or something.  But now I'm wondering about how you'd do this...after all, most of the adventuring and exploring is done by D-Class personnel, and due to the often fatal nature of this it doesn't seem like there's much opportunity for the audience to get attached to characters...  But maybe they could be attached to Researchers/Observers? And part of the appeal is the limited perspective they get from their incomplete, second-hand experiences?  Or, to riff on the X-Files idea, maybe for some reason a couple people from outside the Foundation (not cops, necessarily, but whoever) end up involved, and accompanying D-Class personnel during their experiments, or whatever. This would give the audience consistent characters to get to know and care about, who were constantly put in danger, and the audience could learn about the Foundation as the characters do, as fellow outsiders."

Adaptations require, well, adaptation. Simple solution: Mostly dump that aspect. Replace ""SCPs are dangerous because some of them chew through D-Class like they're candy"" with ""SCPs are dangerous because they chew through one or two major characters a season"". Think Whedon here and the way death is a real threat when he's writing, because, yeah, if your name is not in the title of the show he'll kill ya, rather than buckets o' blood. And the SCP-verse is full of places for main characters to suffer fates worse than death, or be recurring (in their fates worse than death), etc.  (Though there would be some very difficult chats with Executives about how I want to be able to kill a character in an undistinguished episode in the middle of the season, with no ""THIS WEEK A CHARACTER DIES!"" previews, nothing at all out of the ordinary....)  D-Class could also be used as redshirts, but, well, that's pretty cliche now. Were I writing this I might consider that in the first couple episodes to cheaply & quickly establish the stakes but I'd shuffle it offstage quickly."
SCP,3cmknt,jerf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to handle character deaths is to assume the show will only last a season and hold off on explaining the D classes until many episodes in.  Just act like every character is important and every third episode a number of them die.  If you start out with a pool of, say, a dozen D classes and spread 8 deaths across a dozen or so episodes (because seriously scp isn't only about death, they can have a few good days), do one of two things with the last 4.  Depending on the tone you want the show to emphasise.  If you want to go really dark, the next episode is the monthly termination.  ""Congratulations!  You fulfilled your duty and have been granted your freedoms!  please go through this door!"" style.  Or just kill the last 4 off with a particularly nasty scp, probably something famous like 682 or a portal to another dimension like the blood pool (can't remember the number).  Next episode can then concentrate on the next batch of D classes, fully explain their place in the foundation, and promptly let the series completely drop them from significance, shifting instead to follow the previously only moderately recurring researchers.  I think this would accomplish two things:  fulfill the desire to emphasise character deaths, and create a perfect opportunity for a twist halfway through the show.  By the way I really don't think an scp series would survive multiple seasons, because of the scattered tone of it.  UNLESS!  And I just thought of this, every season follows a different group.  Season 1 is the SCP foundation, season 2 is the the chaos insurgency, 3 is the church of the broken god, blah blah blah.  Occasionally of course going back to revisit the earlier groups."
SCP,3cmknt,mehgamer,3,Fri Jul 10 01:13:17 2015 UTC,"By the way I really don't think an scp series would survive multiple seasons   To be honest, I'm not sure the ""mainline"" SCP-verse itself could be a TV show at all, in the way people are thinking where the whole SCP list is sort of somehow considered to exist. It would have to be a ""canon"". Which is aided by the fact that unlike many fan sites, the SCP community openly embraces the fact that the entire universe is inherently inconsistent and head-canons are a thing. (SCP-1132-J please, Marvin.)  But even then... SCP's main bread and butter are ""SCP entries"" that imply a story. The show would have to be about the stories, and that's inevitably going to take it in a different direction, and I'm not sure very many people would agree it's a ""true"" SCP-verse.  Who knows, though. As others point out it all but can't happen; no commercial company would touch this license with a ten foot pole and anybody who gets big enough to do it even remote justice would be well-advised to take the same attitude. At best someone could raid it for ideas and tone and make a knockoff, but in some ways that's already been done and you should just go enjoy those shows instead."

That way individual episodes can maintain their own ""mini canon"" where they just avoid mentioning anything from the other sites.  Plus the ""different groups every season"" plan I mentioned."

The date, time, and a blacked out location shows while it cuts to Dr Bright (a name tag shows this), humming a cheerful song to himself.  The camera follows him as he walks into a room with a number of researchers performing an experiment on some irrelevant scp.  Bright extends his hand to shake with one of the researchers before pulling it back quickly and showing the amulet on his palm, cracking a joke.  After a short introductory scene plays where bright is introduced to the researchers and a few D classes (though the nature of Ds isn't explained at this moment), things obviously go bad.  Containment breach happens, it gets deadly serious with a lot of horror elements almost coming out of nowhere.  Character deaths are dealt out and the scene ends when Dr Bright himself is killed.  Next scene opens up upbeat again, with the date, time, and blacked out location showing it is a few weeks later.  A researcher with the nametag ""doctor bright"" is walking down the hallway, humming the same tune as from the opening but a bit louder. The camera pans down to show the amulet on his palm. Another, quicker scene, he dies with less horror (probably just something falling on him or whatever).  Next scene starts the same way as before, but this time the music is playing in the soundtrack itself, and a full montage of doctor bright dying again and again in various ways begins.

The O5 council would as as Deus ex Machina for the series, entering when necessary for the forward motion of the plot (i.g. interaction with the Oracle, voting on MTF Alpha-9, ect.)  The O5 Factotum will operate as the go-betweens, showing up more often than the council themselves, and building suspense and foreboding toward the moment when a member of the council does show their face.

The hair can grow extremely long and thin, in this picture we see a trimmed specisim to keep it contained.  You now when you walk through a forest and suddenly feel like you have a hair in your face and you try and wipe it off, but the feelings won't go away and you think it's a spider thread or something? Yeah, that's one of those things checking you out. But it could be kilometers away.  It doens't eat or attack big animals though, it sort of lures small animals or insects? in with its movement. It also seems to move more when exposed to danger (fire, being cut). Maybe there could be some sort if reaction when they bring those things together, maybe then they morph their bodies into an even more human like form, even forming rudimentary facial features, but then nothing happens and the foundation can't figure out what it means.  They should also make a distinct sound you can imagine hearing in the forest, but you'd usually ignore. Maybe like dry leafs in the wind when there is no wind.  Edit: I can't spell forest."

Imagine if the containment procedures for 2/3 of the SCPs just said ""Contained on the Moon.""

You can't take care of a ticking timebomb by throwing it out the window, it'll just blow your house up from the outside.    That said, there are several trans-dimensional solutions being considered for SCP disposal. These solutions would effectively remove the SCP from our threat space. None are implemented for mainly two reasons: First, we cannot be positive that any of them are secure from the other side, so we can't be positive every SCP we dispose of that way will remain disposed.

SCP,3cg03x,Dachannien,2,Mon Jul 13 01:02:03 2015 UTC,This skip just makes me realize that I still don't quite understand the difference between a memetic hazard and an infohazard.  Isn't a memetic hazard already a type of infohazard?
SCP,3cg03x,chainsawmissus,3,Wed Jul 8 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"An infohazard is a piece of information which, when observed or understood, causes an effect outside of the observer's mind.  Good examples: SCP-1160 and SCP-609  A ""meme"" was origionally a piece of contagious information.  Kind of like skip-rope rhymes and the three hares.  See Understanding Memetics for a great explanation of that interpretation.  On the wiki, its meaning has mutated a little to mean a piece of information that causes a mental reflex.  A known input into the complex hidden machinery of your brain that gives a know output.  Much like thinking about a person yawning causes you to have an urge to yawn.  Maybe you are strong willed.  May you are too stubborn to yawn because some stranger on the internet is trying to make you.  That doesn't mean the meme didn't work, that your brain didn't automatically react to the word 'yaaaawn' with a mental picture of an open mouth and the memory of how good it feels to stretch those jaw muscles.  You can still feel the tension in your face, hear the popping as the jawbone shifts just enough to equalize the pressure in your ears without you noticing.  All completely normal.  All from within your own brain.  A machine reacting to stimuli."
SCP,3cg03x,Dachannien,2,Sun Jul 12 04:18:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that makes sense.  But there are still several skips out there that include things that seem more like infohazards or cognitohazards, but describe them as being memetic in nature.  For example, things where you look at some text pattern or image, and it kills you.  But shouldn't there be a difference between yawning as an instinctive reaction to other people yawning, and, say, this, which has its roots in cultural knowledge?  P.S. You almost got me to yawn.  Almost.... ;)"
SCP,3cg03x,chainsawmissus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:26:15 2015 UTC,"Oooh, that's a good one.  Yes, a meme is defined by its relation to culture.  In a way every reaction we have to information is based on what we have learned from culture.  Part of the problem is that a ""lethal meme"" only exists in the fantasy world of SCP.  In theory it is a piece of information that causes a mental reaction that kills you.  How?  Nobody ever really explains.  It could be that the activation of certain neurons triggers the over-production of stress hormones.  Now that I think about it I know one example of information causing a harmful reaction: seizures.  People with photo-sensitive epilepsy or migraines avoid specific high frequencies of flashing light.  The input of the repeated pattern of stimuli causes some part of their brains to get stuck in a pattern.  Rouge electrical currents flash through burnt-in pathways over and over, running in circles, interfering with normal impulses, triggering itself to start again.  Especially sensitive people can have seizures from staring at back-lit blinds or particularly bold wallpaper.  Now expand that concept into the realm of soft sci-fi.  Imagine that there is some kind of stimuli that will cause a reaction in all people but we don't know about it because everyone who experienced it dies.  That is the difference.  A meme can be explained by in-universe scientists as a consequence of natural physical laws.  An infohazard or cognitohazard means that Weird Magic Shit beings happening when the information is consumed."

SCP,3chvc6,Skittlethrill,3,Wed Jul 8 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"A few errors strewn about, such as a lack of explanation as what a XXXX-2-B is before putting them into action, or in your first floor examples list where you reference a XXXX-1 instance (previously stated to be the school itself) as being inside room 122 of XXXX-1. Reread it and you'll see the majority of them. Where is it? We've got no idea where this thing is, so how are we supposed to contain it if we cant find it? Further, since the school isn't given a real world location not only is the ""[REDACTED]"" rendered moot (no point in hiding the name if we don't know where it's from), but the reader gets no sense that this place might actually exist somewhere. Instead we get an imaginary school that resides a few miles north of yet another imaginary school in god knows where. Try giving the school a physical location, somewhere we can imagine, like the middle of desert somewhere, or somewhere deep in a forest in Russia, hell, throw it down in some massive underground cavern for Christ's sake. Just put it somewhere where I can use my imagination.  The anomalous effects aren't very well documented. You talk about the XXXX-2 entities being immovable, but don't explain how you know that. You talk about the Lima-Oscar event, but don't describe how long it lasts, where it gets the power for the lights from, or even what goes on beyond the XXXX-2 entities changing places and the odd effect it has on subjects fitting the profile ALPHA-XXXX description (which, I might add, comes as a bit of an ""OOOOOOOO SCARY"" pointless addition). You dont have to give us a long list of tests or anything, but a quick mention of how the school isn't connected to a power grid, or how you threw a rope around XXXX-2 instances and tried to yank 'em out with a tank, but failed would be cool.   This is a pretty good idea and could be pretty great if you got the execution down. If you don't mind, I'd like to take a shot at rewriting this just to show you how I'd do it."

SCP,3c4ls9,eveninglion,48,Sat Jul 4 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Well lets see,    Cofagrigus turns people into mummies, but seems to be containable in that it has a physical container it's stuck to. Dusknoir is said to be in contact with the spirit world, and actively tries to send new people to it. Given that Dusclops is also said to be hollow and contain a black-hole type effect and hands that hypnotise foes, this would be a pretty big danger. No physical form to contain either. Mega Banette. This one is mostly harmless. Aside from some minor pin jabs that is. This ones basically a glorified living voodoo doll. Mega Gengar would be a pretty big threat. This fucker is able to hide in any shadow, so we'd have to have a similar setup to Scip 017. He also constantly chills the air to 10F and can curse people with death just by licking them. With his [shadow tag] ability it would be impossible to escape him too. Given his ability to float and move through walls, this guy would be a serious threat in every sense. Drifblim would be a little hard to keep track of given their tenancy to disappear when spooked, but otherwise they don't seem to bad to handle. They like to float kids away though, so there is that. Spiritomb would be an interesting situation. The thing is made of 108 malevolent angry spirits sealed for their misdeeds. It seems the pokemon as we know it is simply a minor failure of the original containment procedure for these souls. Even if we couldn't fix the original containment procedures put in place, it's still bound to a physical stone which we could still contain. Giratina. Oh boy. This ones a doosie. Given it's god-like lore, and it's comparisons to the pokemon equivalent of the devil, this one is bound to be the biggest challenge. It controls it's own dimension, so containing it would already be nearly impossible, but even worse it can watch our dimension through any mirror-like surfaces. I could go on for ages about this guy, but lets just say he's likely an XK class threat. Chandelure seems fairly innocent, but it seems to have hidden potential. See, the pokedex says that ""The spirits burned up in its ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever"". Given how wandering spirits typically turn out in the SCP universe, I'd say this one has the potential to create more SCP's by proxy. Otherwise it would be about as easy to contain as most other ghosts. Trevenant, despite having some serious destructive potential with it's ability to fully control any given tree at will, is said to be ""kind toward the Pokémon that nest in its body"" so that could be exploited for a containment procedure. It also only seems to attack those that threaten it's forest. Gourgeist wouldn't be too hard. As long as we keep people from hearing it's song, then it should be simple to contain. Shedinja would be one of the trickier ones to contain. Given that they seem to just appear whenever a nincada evolves into a ninjask, we'd have to fully contain all nincada in the world, or just make them extinct. Shedinja steals souls if you look at it's back too. Luckily it would be easy to contain as long as we have either a Flying, Rock, Ghost, Fire, or Dark type attack at the ready for them, given they only have 1HP. Mega Sableye shouldn't be too bad, given that nothing seems to indicate they are malicious. As long as we keep it in the dark and feed it rocks and gems it should be happy. Rotom is easy. Keep it in a lead room with a few simple childrens toys to entertain it. Frosslass's only danger seems to come from the fact that she can freeze people to -58F. That's pretty cold, but not overly dangerous as long as we wear protection from it.  Golurk is an interesting one. Given it's rock body, it won't be phasing through walls anytime soon, but it actually contains a huge amount of mysterious energy in it's body that it can use to fly around at mach speeds ironman style. This energy might be an issue, but it shouldn't even be a problem. In fact Golurk is likely more of an asset than an issue, seeing as how they are all ""programmed"" to protect humans and pokemon. Aegishlash apparently is extremely manipulative, and uses it's ghostly powers liberally to find someone it decides is ""a true leader worthy of becoming king"". Given this fact, it seems we would simply need to find somebody it would consider it's ""Owner"", and contain him in favorable conditions. Otherwise we may just have to persuade it that an SCP operative is a worthy leader. Hoopa. Finally the biggest challenge of the bunch. Giritina was pretty tough, but this guy is even worse. It is also at god-like levels of power, and it seems to also have it's own pocket-dimension of it's own. The big difference here is that Hoopa can create portals between seemingly any dimensions. It can supposedly teleport anything it wishes to or from any other dimension in the multi-verse. This would give it seemingly limitless power. Oh boy, grab your dimension anchors folks.   Here's the list of my travels (through bulbapedia). Make of it what you will."
SCP,3c4ls9,FadeCrimson,15,Sat Jul 4 21:45:24 2015 UTC,"Must add that Hoopa can become Unbound.

SCP,3c4ls9,HappyHapless,5,Sat Jul 4 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I was in a bit of a rush when I wrote this. Hoopa is already almost (if not) impossible to contain normally. I mean, the damn thing can teleport other legendary pokemon from place to place on a whim."

Guards will monitor the object from the room it's in at all times   Guards are now stationed outside the room (See report X-XXX)   Due to the location of the object   ""Due to the fact that the object is immobile""  The whole thing could do with a second read, just to add a feeling of professionalism.   There are a few discrepancies, and things that don't make much sense, see:    The door is apparently capable of opening without any problems but it simply will not   Why is the door apparently capable of opening? Has it opened whilst under surveillance?  Is it incapable of opening for mundane reasons, (dense alloy, etc) or anomalous reasons (no possible explanation).

Keter because, as the two orbit the Earth slowly, it can easily be seen by stargazers which will pull them rapidly from the surface into space, killing them from the cold before the radiation does.

The domestication of a ""wild man"" by a woman as can be seen in Han Solo or Jake Sully.  Where the barren desert is as much a character as any actor like the moon of Moon or the jungles of Pandora.  And let's not forget that in movie after countless movie we replaced the ""Indians"" with aliens - both incomprehensible forces not like ""us white folk.""

SCP,3bsqf6,LazerdongFacemelter,27,Wed Jul 1 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"Best explanation I can give is as follows:   A member of an alien race tries to rebel against the leader of that race. The leader crushes the rebellion and ""broadcasts"" the suffering of the rebel as a warning to others. These aliens exists in more than the three dimensions we know. Humans are unique enough in their vulnerability to memetics that this alien race is unaware of the effect they can have on us. The rebel discovers this when the Foundation experiments with the broadcast as escapes into multiple D class personnel. The alien race descends upon Earth to capture the rebel, seizing control of everything in the process. A few quick thinking agents and researchers use the redacted qualities of a few famously vague SCPs to basically ""reset"" the timeline to before the event happened. The documentation couldn't be undone, however, and was kept by those in the know to discourage causing the event again by saying it's nonsense and not worth further experimentation.   This is one of my favorite ""event"" entries on the wiki (along with SCP-1425), and I think the narrative is wonderfully done, despite it's confusing nature.

Sure, there are tons of SCPs that will make you ask yourself why that shit just happened (093, 087, tons of others), but there are very few like this that give you a background for why something happens, but you have to figure out what actually happened.

SCP,3btdj3,ixfd64,3,Thu Jul 2 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"I'll give the same critique I give when I'm in the chat and people have ideas like this: why should we care? Every good new SCP tries to tell a story within the item, something to get the reader invested. You need to evoke an emotional response, otherwise it's merely a thing that does a thing, and that's boring."
SCP,3btdj3,MountainTimePunch,2,Thu Jul 2 00:42:52 2015 UTC,"This. I've slogged through hours of SCPs that were nothing but ""object/ location/person with anomalous properties/contents/abilities"". It may be mildly interesting as a novelty, but it's not worth upvoting if it doesn't make me feel existential dread, visceral sickness, or at the very least creeping unease. There needs to be something that makes me go ""...oh..."", or ""Dear God"", or simply ""WHY"".  For example, the WiFi signal: Maybe it should actually be the router itself that's anomalous (nailing down an electromagnetic signal as being an SCP is a little difficult), and the internet accessed through it is disturbing, but there also has to be something...else. Like maybe everything on every site is posted by one person, or maybe everyone only says one word over and over instead of talking, or maybe there are lots of links to one site which is also anomalous (cognitohazardous or something). Just please don't make it another one of those ""it can see into a whole different universe"" things, they're really overplayed."
SCP,3btdj3,Hlothwig,2,Thu Jul 2 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"The wi-fi router could be something from the church of the broken god's splinter group as a way to try to recruit new members. That could have some interesting mileage to it, providing something similar doesn't already exist."
SCP,3btdj3,insomniacgnostic,3,Thu Jul 2 14:30:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is that I don't think the CotBG has much to do with electronics. Their god is supposed to be mechanical, and most of the objects related to them are clockwork or otherwise physical. They have little to nothing to do with electricity, much less electronics as advanced as a WiFi router."
SCP,3btdj3,Hlothwig,3,Thu Jul 2 18:19:53 2015 UTC,I think it could be a maxwellist type item. They're a splinter group discussed on http://www.scp-wiki.net/church-of-the-broken-god-hub
SCP,3btdj3,insomniacgnostic,3,Thu Jul 2 20:21:18 2015 UTC,I had no idea about those other two factions. Are they mentioned in any of the item files?
SCP,3btdj3,Hlothwig,3,Thu Jul 2 20:34:19 2015 UTC,I think there was one space ship thing or island that all three factions assault at one point. Can't remember the number. I'd recommend to click around the uh or tag or utilize the google.
SCP,3btdj3,insomniacgnostic,2,Thu Jul 2 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"I wrote an article that involves Maxwellism, SCP-2660. The splinter groups do not have dedicated tags, though, there's just one for ""broken god"" related articles."

This is usually done through evocative imagery and some form of interesting bigger picture that generates an emotional response.  You are the DM, here. We the readers / players do not want you to read the statblock from the back of the manual. Spin us a tale. Make us give a shit."
SCP,3btdj3,Djoric,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:33:20 2015 UTC,"Its always going to be this, and its always been this. Even in the Top Rated-List all the SCPs on there (even Series 1) had a story to go with them, no matter how basic it was.  You can't just look at an item and just say, ""Oh it does spooky shit!"" You have to explain, engage, show, and have a background to go with the ""spooky shit"". IF the readers aren't feeling curious, scared, weirded-out, or any sort of feeling. The SCP has most likely failed in its goal.  There are so many SCPs I've flat out skipped halfway through reading them, simply because it felt like D&D text for something that I can't even use."
SCP,3btdj3,Aj_The_Wanderer,2,Fri Jul 3 06:15:24 2015 UTC,Also remember the emotional response doesn't have to be fear. It can be any emotion!
SCP,3btdj3,awesomeninja1,3,Thu Jul 2 10:06:27 2015 UTC,"I like the Wi-Fi one. Maybe the effects are different for each person. For one D-Class, each photo of an apple is a severed head. For another, D-Class he keeps seeing pictures of his old school teacher in background pictures. A third, every Youtube video addresses him by name."
SCP,3btdj3,Lots42,2,Thu Jul 2 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"Something close to number two got featured in a Doctor Who episode, but there's plenty of directions to take the concept.  Number one is pretty cool (no pun intended)! I'd point out that ""memetic"" doesn't mean ""mind control"" and something emanating from a physical object isn't a memetic effect.  I have a bias for anomalies with tangible (if weird) explanations, so I'd attribute it to a kind of carnivorous microorganism that lives in hot springs rather than something that can ""manifest"" - although admittedly, this also simplifies the containment procedures.  Number five honestly sounds too useful and harmless. The useful objects owned by the Foundation nearly always come with a catch - the more useful/powerful, the more dangerous. (With the notable exception of SCP-458, I suppose.) This would serve up omniscience and nigh infinite computing power essentially for free."
SCP,3btdj3,Arancaytar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:30:52 2015 UTC,"RE: #5- perhaps the program compels the user to keep using it more and more, until they are so driven by a thirst for answers that  they never leave and die at the keyboard."

SCP,3bp0ls,SpastixFantastix,4,Wed Jul 1 13:07:31 2015 UTC,We can choose what the banner is via the 'look and feel' section of the subreddit settings but not where it goes. It's a well-known quirk of reddit. There are various hacky CSS things to do it but given that most of reddit behaves the same way we do I don't see any significant upside to changing it here.
SCP,3bp0ls,bluesoul,2,Wed Jul 1 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"I know - that's why I suggested a snoo picture be the link to reddit.com and have the foundation logo link here, replacing the ""SCP"" text at the top of the page. I've seen other subreddits do it, but I don't know how hard it is."
SCP,3bp0ls,wasniahC,3,Wed Jul 1 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"It's not hard, but it's not best practice either. The banner image is supposed to be a snoo with the word 'reddit', and we (and many other subs) are not doing that.  Could we change where it goes? Yes. Are we going to? Probably not."
SCP,3bp0ls,undergroundmonorail,6,Wed Jul 1 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"That being said, the vast majority of subreddits have a snoo-ish thing that you click to go to reddit, and clicking the banner/text next to it goes to the subreddit. Isn't that best practice?  Couldn't you separate the foundation logo and the text saying ""The SCP Foundation"" into two separate things? The logo links to reddit, the ""The SCP Foundation"" linking to this subreddit? That would be really consistent with, well.. every other subreddit! No?  Edit: Examples: https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/ https://www.reddit.com/r/Prismata/ https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/ https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryBeasts/ (And a lot of the imaginary network) https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/    You could just take out the little /r/scp thing then, even!  I do want to point out that with all this being said, I think the current banner ain't bad - there are some subreddits which just drive me mad with having either nothing to click to go back to reddit.com, or nothing to click to just go back to the sub frontpage."
SCP,3bp0ls,bluesoul,3,Wed Jul 1 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"This would be my vote. I don't actually care very much, but I would prefer it the way you describe."
SCP,3bp0ls,wasniahC,2,Wed Jul 1 16:30:25 2015 UTC,I also want to point out that none of those work in RES until the subreddit style is enabled. I know I do that only very rarely when like a sidebar doesn't work.
SCP,3bp0ls,HeirToGallifrey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"Huh? I've got RES, subreddit style is still enabled by default for me - and even if the subreddit style isn't enabled, you still have a snoo (reddit) and the text (Steam) to click to go places, right? I'm not sure I get what your point is, sorry! Maybe I'm missing something obvious?"

Being able to cut it off with a pair of scissors puts power back in the hands of the victim.  Whether it contributes or detracts really depends on the article.  In a meta sense, I love how many SCPs are indestructible.  It means the GOC can't be destroying everything, they have to be using their lore, tech, or magic to render stuff harmless.  Either that or the PSYCHE Division has a dirty little secret."

SCP,3bo7zm,The-Paranoid-Android,9,Wed Jul 1 01:04:44 2015 UTC,"Well from what I can collect from it all...(This will be a long TL:DR but much shorter than the whole SCP read; this is because 093 is a very complicated SCP.)  This disk is a tool to travel to a random location to this other universe that is very similar to ours.  The location is different in this universe for every person and it will change it hue (color) whenever another person is holding it.    To get to the other dimension you must hold the disk and touch a mirror like surface; then you are able to walk through the mirror like a portal.   This universe had the same history as our own up until around 350 years before 1972. (As read in Agent |-|||-|'s Report in 093's recovered materials.)  At that time this world had a technological boom that came from He, (He is a god-like being of unknown origin in the report mentioned earlier.)  He declared that the world was unclean and full of Sin, and that the world must purge itself of Sinners.   A war erupted and the ones left alive would be the 'clean'.   For ten years the cultures of the worlds advanced their science in prepare for war. While this happened, He disappeared and the war went on anyways.   After this war, the only landmass that is considered clean is similar to the U.S in our world but with much greater technology.   The unclean still roamed the world and the clean did what they could to contain it, but eventually became consumed by the plaque.  The only things they say about physical appearance for the unclean is that they are faceless and that they bleed liquid that has a very rancid smell that is very easy to notice.   They cannot be harmed with normal guns that use bullets, and can only be killed with weapons that can only be found in this other world.  Holy crap im tired after writing this.

Similar to 701 (the Hanged King), but it was the actual geographical area itself that made people take on the roles of whatever they were acting as. That's pretty much all I can remember, but if anybody has any ideas that'd be awesome!  Edit: Just thought of something, I think it was built around the time of the Roman Empire.

Ice-nine is supposedly a polymorph of water more stable than common ice (Ice Ih); instead of melting at 0 °C (32 °F), it melts at 45.8 °C (114.4 °F). When ice-nine comes into contact with liquid water below 45.8 °C (thus effectively becoming supercooled), it acts as a seed crystal and causes the solidification of the entire body of water, which quickly crystallizes as more ice-nine. As people are mostly water, ice-nine kills nearly instantly when ingested or brought into contact with soft tissues exposed to the bloodstream, such as the eyes.

Also as 4r4nd0md4y said, S Andrew Swann's proposal for 001. In what I wrote I gave the SCP wiki a different designation just to prevent confusion with that 001 proposal, and, well, probably someday there will be a real SCP-3124 but by then this will all be forgotten. :)  Anyway, point being, this isn't a coincidence; I was deliberately drawing on the established ideas on the Wiki and I wanted to acknowledge that.  That said... while the Descartes hypothesis can not truly be disproved and perhaps somehow the wool is being kept over our eyes with a degree of sophistication we can hardly imagine, I will say that as I look out into the world, if there is any problem I see, it's an overassumption of all-powerful forces and deep, dark conspiracies where the perfectly normal actions of seven billion people, many of them power hungry and stepping on each other to attain it, suffice to explain what we see.

Especially as we go barreling along the 21st century in which we may well play the part of Descartes' demon to some system before too long. We may have already crossed that line, depending on how you measure. Most people probably wouldn't say that's what we're talking about as worms are a long way from people. Still, it's the right path... and perhaps one of those cases where you might find ""real life"" is getting awfully-close to SCP-fiction on you....

SCP,3ba870,night-addict,3,Sat Jun 27 07:02:07 2015 UTC,"I always thought a 'song that never ends,  it keeps going on and on my friends' would be an interesting SCP"
SCP,3ba870,FailedTech,5,Sat Jun 27 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"Safe  Piece of paper kept in room in locked briefcase, with lyrics written on it. People who see the paper have a minor compulsion to read it, though this compulsion has not been demonstrated to be anomalous.   People who read the song have a strong but resistible compulsion to sing it. The ability to resist is greatly increased in participants aware of the danger.  Once singing begins, the participant cannot stop. After this point the most common causes of death are choking or dehydration. Administrated IV fluids, the second most common cause of death is exhaustion.  The hazard is memetic and probably not related to the paper. Anyone hearing the song or reading a transcription of it has a similar strong compulsion to sing it, though again this is easy to resist for those who understand the risks involved.  Physically obstructing the jaw or mouth often leads to injury. Even if successful, the subject continues attempting to vocalize and the sames issues of dehydration and exhaustion persist.  Drugging of the subject has been a temporary solution to allow rest, but no amount of time incapacitated has been shown to end the effect. Surgical removal of the jaw has resulted in complete 'recovery'.  Compulsion to song is often completely gone after 3-5 hours. Most people who read or hear the song seem to forget it after about one week if they do not sing it. This effect is likely anomalous.  A memetic countermeasure has been developed. Repeating a single important rhyming word from the song until it begins to not sound like a word anymore (semantic satiation) produces a short but powerful resistance. More than 30 trials with class-D personnel have indicated that upon reaching the semantically satiated word, the subject looked briefly confused and was able to stop singing. This is not 100% effective. One participant looked briefly confused but then was affected and had to be euthanized.  After incident # only class D personnel are allowed to read or hear the song.  (Incident describes researcher who knew the song but obviously chose not to sing it. One night she begins mumbling it to herself unintentionally while falling asleep which leads to becoming fully affected. She survives for a few weeks on IV fluids and drug-induced sleep before eventually having large amounts of her jaw and vocal organs amputated (at her own request) and returning to work. It is emphasized that many, many researchers and doctors have worked with and heard the song and that this does not typically happen.)  Another incident: A subject who has adapted to the effect and is able to eat/sleep/drink with only minor difficulty. They swallow in between pauses in verse. They roll around and hum in their sleep. Quality of sleep is questionable. Addendum about 14 months later describes them dying to a heart attack. Medical professionals are not surprised given extreme exhaustion and stress.  All affected subjects describe (in writing) that singing the song to gives them a slight feeling of joy and fulfillment."

Creeps are weak minions that endlessly run at the enemy base and can be killed for money.  The initial 3 SCDs referenced are all bugs that have occurred with cosmetic items in the game. The first hero is Juggernaut, the second hero is Crystal Maiden, who in the lore is from an area called Icewrack.  -gold, -lvlup, and -createhero are all console commands that can be used in private lobbies to test heroes out in a sandbox environment.  SCD-003 is the hero Ancient Apparition.  The heroes shown in the next panel are (from left to right) Lion, Necrophos (rip Necrolyte), Pugna, and Shadowfiend. They are all shown as being under the effects of Ancient Apparition's ""Chilling Touch"" spell (the blue around the hands).  ""In case of emergency evacuation"" he hands Treant a Town Portal Scroll, an item which can be consumed in game to teleport to any allied structure.  The scientist/creep that gets frozen in place is shown being affected by Ancient Apparition's spell ""cold feet"" (hooray puns)  Treant is shown casting his ultimate (spell you can only learn once you have reached level 6 in a game, usually a hero's most powerful spell), an ability that causes roots to grow around all enemies around you, holding them in place for a duration.  The rest is just generic ice stuff, no abilities specific to Ancient Apparition.  Dota is a cool game :B"

SCP,3b81qq,PiranhaJAC,9,Fri Jun 26 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"Item #: SCP-███  Object Class: Euclid  Special Containment Procedures: SCP-███ is to kept inside an immovable container composed of shatter-proof perspex, with no door or other means of external access. The wall of the container that faces the lockroom door must be opaque, such that direct sight of the object is impossible from outside the room. Personnel must not look directly at the object, but may view photographs and live video. Any entry by a human into the lockroom must be supervised via video link. Test subjects must be prevented from attempting to open the container and attacking the object. Any person exposed to sight or touch of SCP-███ who suffers from long-term mental distress should be treated with counselling and/or amnestics as appropriate.  Description: SCP-███ is the shell of an egg laid by a domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), currently shattered into 87 small fragments and some dust. Unmediated sight or touch of the object, or any part of it, causes a human to be afflicted by two intense delusions:   SCP-███ is absolutely indestructible. SCP-███ must be destroyed as soon as possible.   Afflicted subjects are able to correctly identify SCP-███ as the shattered remains of an eggshell, and they admit to not having any rational basis for their anomalous beliefs. Acute exposure may lead to obsessive fear and hatred of the object, which may compound into severe mental illness if not treated.  SCP-███ has sustained serious damage from being crushed in an industrial vice by Researcher Boyd. The original version of this documentation classified SCP-███ as Keter, and identified it as an intact egg of the SCP-682 species. This mistake has been traced to the object's influence on Researcher Boyd, who directed the commencement of termination protocols modelled on the treatment of SCP-682.  The Special Containment Procedures for this object are designed to protect the object from further damage, as all evidence shows that it in fact possesses no anomalous physical properties. There is no evidence for it posing any direct threat - the only harm traceable to SCP-███ is via its memetic effects.  Except of Interview ███-001   Interview conducted shortly after Researcher Boyd was relieved of responsibility for SCP-███.  Researcher Boyd: It can not be destroyed, no matter what we try.  Dr. ███████: But it's already-  Researcher Boyd: CAN! NOT! BE! DESTROYED!  At this point, Researcher Boyd screamed and began weeping. He did not respond to any further questions."

When you visit the page, you scroll down progressively to view the chapter, however this page had a script which autoscrolled the page downwards, even if you tried to scroll upwards.

And since they'd all been shoved in a dry, dark place for all those years, the condition was so good that the whole lot of them net him thousands and thousands of dollars, though I forget just how much it was.

Successful/strong memes and memetic structures have a very high rate of transmission and ""stickiness"", in that once you've become aware of the information, you continue to be aware of it rather than forgetting it. Religion is memetic. So is language.  For the purposes of the Foundation, a memetic agent is something that ""infects"" you with virulent/""contagious"" information, usually in a way that changes your behavior. A Jehovah's Witness proselytizing to you is a memetic agent, though not an anomalous one. A person who could tell you the True Name of God, which makes you instantly convert to a specific religion and become a fervent believer would be an anomalous memetic agent. Agents don't have to be people either: in the above example, the True Name could be passed along in a book, as a painting or picture, as a specific location that people regularly pass through, etc."

SCP,3b3oub,ThumpingMontgomery,3,Thu Jun 25 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"I'm intrigued, you do have some interesting elements. But what's the story? IMO what makes a good SCP is one that tells a story, not just description.  My humble suggestion: Perhaps take the emphasis on plant based materials, the ancient China ruins, and keep the Lovecraft tentacle beast (that description is creepy and awesome - I especially like the 2 mph detail).   In any case, thanks for sharing!  From there: How was it hanging out so long without rubber? What if it needs to be enclosed in a wooden box instead? It's still plant material. Then there's the question of its origin or base nature. Maybe it's related to ancient Chinese nature demons, maybe it belongs to Lovecraft's alternate dimension and ended up here for some strange reason, maybe it was once a person (religious cult gone wrong)? That could better inform its powers, intentions, and by extension proper containment procedures.  I worry it's too many ideas, but if you want the reality warping + mind control then maybe the reality warping is only possible when attracted to a sentient host. It's got so many tentacles, maybe its powers compound the more people it latches on to. The exponential growth in danger is a classic SCP trope (hello XK-class end of the world scenario), but makes for a good argument for all of the containment procedures.  So then, backstory: ancient manifestation of man's tendency to destroy the natural world? Creature from another dimension looking to create portal for his bigger, creepier pals? Science/magic/whatever experiment gone wrong? meat-puppet marionette entertainer from hell? Your choice, and you don't need to tell the story outright...I just like SCPs that hint, not just describe.

Here's the best way to fix the generic factor: on the surface, it looks like a mind controlling, reality warping tentacle monster, but that's just a cover put up by the Foundation, and the truth about it is far more terrifying. Have an addendum accessible to only Level 4 personnel with something there about how stereotypical monsters are no longer scary, and how they keep it in containment by convincing people it's just a stereotypical Lovecraft monster so they aren't afraid of its true power.

I do agree that it's a bit generic though.  I will suggest that you go into the SCP IRC room because it's pretty much the best place to get instant critique from experienced site writers. Beware, though, it's likely that they will rip your draft apart.  My personal opinion on your draft, as someone who has written several successful articles and reviewed many more, is that it's lacking extra flavor. There isn't all that much more than ""horror monster"", unless you decide to actually deconstruct the idea of the horror monster, which I'd be a fan of.

He must see his greed punished, his thirst for control unquenched, his sense of self-righteousness shattered on the flagstones. He thinks he won, but that's the entire basis of SCP-032's existence: He didn't. He may have his hope for beauty in the world, but if he goes to collect his long, lost wife from the Foundation, then he'll see what new fresh hell he's unleashed upon himself. Once he's no longer able to have the potential to put good into the world, he'll truly be alone. No hope, no beauty, only an eternal longing and the three deaths laughing in the distance.

It helped to get the site more mainstream attention, and contributed to the single largest surge in membership in site history.

SCP,3au05f,OfMiceAndMouseMats,14,Tue Jun 23 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"I've just seen the Tom Scott video on Paternoster Lifts and the concept begs to be skipified.  Paternoster lifts aren't like regular lifts, which go up and down at the command of a button.  Instead they move automatically on a rotating belt, and it is up to the passengers to hop on and off at their own discretion.  They aren't made anymore for obvious reasons - they're dangerous to use if you're young, old, disabled or just have heavy bags.  What's interesting to me is the 'up and over' element.  The paternoster lifts need to keep moving on a cycle, so go into the basement or the loft of a building to complete the circuit and change direction again.  There's nothing necessarily dangerous about doing this.  Its pointless - you'll pass your floor at some stage and, if you're going down, you might as well get on the lift already going down than get the one that's going up and over - but the worst you'll do is unbalance the lift and get it stuck.  But the 'up and over' (or, 'down and under' if you're switching from descent to ascent) is interesting to me.  I'm trying to think of things that could happen, but am struggling to get past being transported to bizarro world #4213, which is a little cliché."

Documents state the lift was installed to make the place feel more busy to attract clients."

Simply, that for each cycle it goes over the top, a few people 'enter' the car (provided no humans were in it at the time). These then filter out on random levels, mill about a bit and then hop back on at closing time.  Give them some mechanism of distinguishing them from the 'normal humans' running about the mall, like they all have the same scar, etc or something and it invokes a little bit of 'constructed humans' creep factor. Maybe they carry identical backpacks?   Then, you have to think about what they're like when you talk to them - do they pass a turing test, or are they mute? Maybe they can talk to you but they're largely empty inside if you ask them about anything beyond the time they were 'made'.  Perhaps, even, if you talk to them they all provide the same information - as if they all have the same backstory because they were made using one person's memories.  Maybe even, it comes down to something like The Tunnel Under the World (which is an awesome read, btw), and the whole thing is a set up to test marketing strategies..."

If they step out, gravity has the reverse effect on them. Other people who did not ride around can get in at the same time and experience normal gravity.  In the interests of not having just another SCP wot's bad for you, it can be trivially flipped by just riding around again and I wouldn't try to dial up ""and there's a percent chance you get flipped inside out or something"" or any of the other make-it-scary cliches. If you wanted to expand it, it would actually be interesting to let this be one of those SCPs that the Foundation actually gets to use, such as observing that gravity-flipped rocket fuel really turns the rocket equation on its head. It would take a while to process a rocket launch's worth of fuel, though, on the other hand, you need a lot less fuel when your fuel is actually naturally accelerating you up anyhow.... someone could work the math on that without much work.

SCP,3aqjqr,lukazaz,2,Tue Jun 23 22:13:56 2015 UTC,"Have to agree. There seems to be a bit too much cliche and ultimateness in this one.   All knowing device Would change everything (economy, technology, society) Every other SCP could be analyzed completely Needs to resort to plot-armor to not explain 682 and 106 Most of the fun for SCP is ""not knowing""   In general, it's a bad idea to make an SCP so omni-useful that should be mentioned in every other SCP article. 682 and 914 already do that and it gets more taxing to write each new article for every one of these we have.  Also, If I were O5 I'd execute anyone who tried to stick our most valuable asset into 914. Don't put something into 914 unless you're okay with losing it. Don't put something into 914 unless you're okay with it turning against you.  I think it's salvageable if you just make it hard to use or unreliable. You can keep the potential of infinite knowledge.  I'm thinking of it as an alien tablet computer. It has access to tons of important stuff, but the connection sucks, or the UI is unclear, or it has regular bugs.  Maybe the file-sizes are huge even for really simple stuff. Like 500TB for a few lines of text, because of inefficiencies. Kind of like our modern operating systems and filetypes. This doesn't normally matter for such an advanced tool, but it's very far from home so the signal is slow. Now it can give ultimate knowledge but you have to pick carefully.  It has internal data, but this is limited. You can decide what is on the internal drive and this can give some hints as to its original creator/owner. Maybe tons of data about Earth, including thousands of recent snapshots of our entire internet.  Maybe searching through these files is hard to do because of the alienness of the file structures or AI assistant.  Also, the 'if you're exposed to this for too long you will die and there's nothing we can do to reverse this effect and it makes you insane' trope is one of the most overdone, so I would advise something more creative, or less extreme."

In case where machine was programmed to do random actions where one may result in operating machine, resulting gumball was flavorless.  When using trained animals, mass was removed from animals.

They jumble around as you dispense more but never seem to run lower.  Kept in locked room next to a massive store of dimes. We never get our dimes back.  Red - person enters murderous rage for a few seconds, afterwards they are extremely apologetic and gentle for hours, as though they'd 'used up' their anger  Yellow - Person can breathe water for an hour, but cannot breathe air in the meantime.  Purple - Person becomes extremely high and euphoric. Will try to extract as many gumballs from the machine as possible, take all the purple ones, and run away with them. Extremely addictive. Detox and withdrawal can last days to a week.  Grey - Person becomes extremely difficult to harm, heavier, and slower moving. Effects last a few hours. Prolonged usage seems to result in internal damage, especially to ears, spine and connective tissues.  White - Apparently no effect at first, but later discovered to combine the effects of every gumball previously eaten by that person.  Black - Immediately ends the effect of every gumball on the person. Removes addiction from users of Purple. Resets which gumballs you have consumed for purposes of White.  Orange - Subject burst into flames.  Magenta - Mistaken for purple, subject frothed at the mouth and died upon ingesting. In the future, all gumballs must be identified with a high contrast color scanner before experimentation.  Blue - Subject experienced heavily increased speed and reflexes. Tests indicate the effects are temporal, not metabolic. Small stores of the gumballs have been distributed to personnel where they may be useful. No direct side effects, but does not affect equipment, clothes or surroundings. As a result, heat rash, foot and knee injuries are common. Recommend training under influence before usage in combat. Duration is always exactly 43411 seconds (about 12 hours).  Very, very dark blue - Originally mistake for black, but actually a very dark shade of blue. Subject glowed with bluish-white light and began to float. Subject incinerated 3 guards with beams of light, before obtaining dozens more dark-blue gumballs from the machine and attempting to distribute them to others. Subject was shot before being able to do so and melted into a pile of white ash.  Brown - All subjects refuse to eat brown gumballs. Extreme antipathy expressed by any living thing exposed to it. Force fed to a test animal, which underwent and extremely painful death involving rotting from the inside out. Left a horrible smell and pile of putrid vomit-like mixture.  The frequency of various colors varies over time. Primary colors, black and white are most common. Slightly off colors such as 'very very dark blue' are rare and tend to be more severe. The entity created by 'very very dark blue' was nevertheless able to obtain several more with only a small pile of different color gumballs discarded, suggesting there are ways to control the outcome, or that several of the same color were stacked together.  Management will not allow experimenters to break it open. A stock of Black is kept on hand as an emergency remedy."

This may not be the most realistic, but its a heck of a lot simpler to implement as trying to jump the time ahead to compensate gets messy, and running the time during a battle would lead to the player missing important events."
SCP,3ajy5q,ErnulaxCuilan,3,Sun Jun 21 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"I just meant more like, I can't actually remember many skips nowadays where a conventional MTF team goes in capturing monsters and those kind of baddies."
SCP,3ajy5q,The-Paranoid-Android,2,Sun Jun 21 19:30:51 2015 UTC,Many are simply picked up by basic response teams its true. However seeing as this is a game I'm taking a few liberties to make it have a bit more action.  That being said not all skips will generate combat situations. Some will be recovered without an issue.

SCP,3ajy5q,paulbutterjunior,5,Sun Jun 21 04:00:37 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. I am really not sure. Tactical game play totally makes sense. I think the xcom ideas you were discussing definitely clicked.   I think a fraught feeling of danger, I am under the impression that D Class have the highest casualty rate, but MTFs are a close second. Just because you deploy an MTF squad for containment or capture does not mean it is going to work.   I dunno, I am not a game designer amd dont know if this will help. There are a lot of ways to take it but those are my first thoughts"
SCP,3ajy5q,not---a---bot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:22:51 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about not being a designer, the more conversations I can have with future players the better able I am to figure out what you are looking for in a game.  As far as a feeling of danger and success rates, they will vary greatly depending on the situation. It won't be a balanced situation like the latest XCOM, Depending on the nature of the incident and how well prepared the player is the events can be nearly impossible to contain or very easy. Containment breaches in particular can be very hazardous and will hopefully make players think carefully about their investments in Containment technology.  Also part of the reason I am including squad based combat is to highlight the incredible danger of certain SCPs. Squad members will make expendable demonstrations of the power of an SCP without being frustrating by instantly killing characters the player has invested in.  Does this help or am I really off from your original thoughts?"

SCP,3aj5wu,astupidho,5,Sat Jun 20 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"Man, really nice episode. You guys definitely sound more sure of yourselves in reading through, and the continuation of talking about things I never would have noticed otherwise is why this is unique.  I do have a few questions, in particular:  You guys skipped over the Black Queen in the Groups of Interest reading. Was there any particular reason why?  I don't know how many tales you've read aside from the one this episode, but if you have read a number, what do you like about the tales? Were there any that you thought were particularly neat? (It is interesting that Wikidot brought up a tale at +10, and an underrated to boot! :P)  How long did it take to put together that dossier, as far as putting it together and paring it down to read for the podcast? It seemed like you did put work into it, even if its a summary. (Though some things read there, specifically for security levels, I can't remember reading about until recent o.o)  MONTAUK is a reference to a, well... infamous SCP on the site. Dunno if it's better to link or wait for you guys to discover it on your own, but it is a somewhat lengthy SCP, and practically a whole episode could be done on just it."
SCP,3aj5wu,ErnulaxCuilan,3,Sun Jun 21 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"The dossier was all Ratking's doing, he's pretty fantastic with stuff like that.  I'll let him field those questions, but there are still some I can answer!  This was our first tale, and we hadn't seen any others.  Having come from a theatre background big on presentation, I like that tales seem to have more narrative freedom and really let the author stretch their creative legs in a less restricted setting than an article provides.  We tried to reflect this in the show by reading the whole tale at once and talking about it in post, rather than breaking it down segment by segment for analysis.  In the future it might even be cool if just one person is reading the tale to preserve that narrative flow, with the other person chiming in for dialogue or contextual things like stage direction.  Suffice to say, I can't WAIT to read more tales, and the one we covered in this episode was a genuine pleasure to unravel.  As for MONTAUK, it'll probably get its own dossier segment now that we know about it!  The dossier is where we have the freedom to report on matters of our choosing in a succinct and informative way, and we're quickly coming to realize how vital a counterpart that is to the structure of the rest of the show.  Thank you so much again for your support, and expect to see us on the wiki soon (hopefully!)"
SCP,3aj5wu,uglyrodent,3,Sun Jun 21 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"I'll cover the dossier stuff since that was more my project than anything. The dossier took me maybe around an hour or so to research and jot down. However, I wrote it very informally and with some notes intended for Ganymede, since it was supposed to be sort of a shorthand reference/cheat sheet for us. The version we read was basically the same thing with the notes removed, however a couple of the factions got deleted by accident. I haven't listened to the final edit, so I dunno if this was removed or not, but I also accidentally cut out the description of Nobody at first and came up with that summary more or less on the spot. I guess the Black Queen totally slipped my mind. We'll make sure to cover it in detail in our next dossier segment to make up for it! Thanks for letting us know."

SCP,3aj5wu,Cris_To_Baal,3,Sun Jun 21 10:44:52 2015 UTC,"Wow! I'm so happy you read and dissected my tale! Thank you very very much <3. Feels unreal to hear it narrated...  You pretty much got almost all of it in the end, the best way to explain what is going on in the tale is the Map-territory thing. In the tale's universe, ""maps"" become impossible. The bit about quantum physics is basically saying that our maps of it are so convulted they actually harm our understanding of it. Something you got wrong is the world changing to accommodate lies, that was never intentionally implied.  Nailed it on the breakup, not on me hating humanity though, I love us! (And our lies)  You found the tale on the random tale page? What are the odds... Thought it was forgotten.  Thank you for this.  EDIT: astupidho, you say you come from a theatre background...

Doesn't seem like it was a big deal, but we just got used to talking about the source of the text being the author, we should have said it was the narrator (who, to be fair, seemed pretty cynical).  Thanks for the feedback! Your tale was a real trip to read and dissect, and I'm glad we weren't too far off base :D"
SCP,3aj5wu,Cris_To_Baal,2,Mon Jun 22 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing I absolutely love, it's getting feedback from the actual authors.  I'm glad you enjoyed our reading, and it's neat to see what we picked up on and what we totally missed (it seems like there's always a little of both!)  As for your edited-in question, I have a little miming experience, but a close friend of mine (who's actually going to be guest-starring on the show!) studied physical theatre extensively and would probably be a better pick for your mysterious task.  I'll pass it along if you want.   Finally, how do you feel about coming on for the interview episode?  We want to get a nice handful of authors from all sorts of different works, and I think I speak for both of us when I say your tale was one of our favorite readings so far."
SCP,3aj5wu,uglyrodent,3,Mon Jun 22 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"Negative on the interview, I might write english passably but I don't really speak it. I could make myself understood I suppose but it wouldn't be pretty :X.   Regarding the mime thing, there's this idea (I don't remember who had it, and said it in chat) about an SCP what is basically a mime or some other entity... Information about that entity might only be transferred through pantomime, anything else and death or worse happens, no talking about it, no writing about it, no taking pictures of it, etc.  The idea would be to have a video, then, instead of the usual SCP format. (Thats called a ""format screw"", like this.)   The video would consist of a Foundation researcher, dressed as such (You or your friend maybe?)  coldly and clinically explaining what this skip is and how it works, through pantomime. Something like pointing at its cage, doing a pantomime signifying the act of speaking, then doing one to make it clear you would die if you did speak about it (Maybe the ""neck cut"" motion with a hand, and droping your head sideways?)... This is where I hope an actual mime would know how to make it work. Ideally the whole performance would have the same format as a typical SCP, object class followed by containment procedures followed by description. How would you say ""Euclid"" with pantomime though? How would you say pantomime itself? I think its a pretty damn cool idea, not an easy one though. Maybe it could be your first skip!"

Still, I feel the need to defend the zombie. First off, it comes from a different place than the rest of the aspects of the SCP. The rest of the outfits just make people act a certain way, but then BOOM, in one addendum you've gone from memetic to corporeal effects. Secondly, the zombie, like the rest of the play, is an oversimplified version of the historical events. The play rushes through a lot of history in an hour or two, and the zombie effect is the result of an effort to do this with Christ's resurrection.  But yeah, a lot of stuff could work really well.

Perhaps some testing notes pointing out that as time has gone on, and more tests have been run, that subtle variations have started appearing during the performance, and that further testing is warranted to see if this is caused by the various actors or if it's caused by the box itself.  Or, perhaps after a few days, the actor that plays Jesus will 'return', being utterly convinced that he's the real Jesus, to the point that he tries to perform miracles, which always fail, often leading to injury or death. Perhaps even a funny note about how many D-Class have drowned after trying to prove they're Christ by walking on water."

The basic story seems to be that the fetus was a reality bender, but its mother (possibly realizing its abilities while she was still pregnant) tried to abort it. Being a reality bender, it didn't take kindly to this, and now warps the room it was in. The old man was feeding himself to the parrots because that is what the fetus believes its mother should have done, sacrificed willingly for its sake. The septic-tank thing represents the fetus itself, and it's detected as inside the nearest female because that's where the fetus believes it should be, inside a loving mother. The title (meaning ""blank slate"") is talking about the fetus, a blank slate with no experiences.  Yeah, it's pretty messed up."

The last addendum reveals that the real chupacabra messiah had actually already been born; its memory had just been erased from the mind of 2636 by amnestics, and therefore it still thought it needed to create a messiah child. Even though the gods are dead and the second child was killed, the actual chupa-messiah is still out there, doing who knows what."

SCP,3a30qt,OwariNeko,9,Tue Jun 16 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"SCP-XXXX  Item Classification: Safe Euclid  Special Containment Procedures: A single copy of SCP-XXXX is to be stored in a standard object containment locker. It is to be kept covered except for testing at all times. The key is to be kept in Dr. ████'s office.  Tests involving SCP-XXXX are not to exceed 55 minutes in length without level 2 approval. Following incident XXXX-1, no visual recording devices may be brought into the testing area. Following incident XXXX-2, all testing involving SCP-XXXX is suspended without O5 approval.  Description: SCP-XXXX is a photograph image, usually depicting distorted versions of typical animals and objects. The contents of the photograph image are reported differently depending on the observer.  Approximately 10% of viewings of SCP-XXXX display a distorted scene containing no creatures. In approximately 80% of cases, observers report seeing a distorted scene including one or more animals, and in approximately 10% of cases the scene includes one or more humans. In one recorded case, (See incident report XXXX-2).   When scenes including humans or animals are viewed, the subject is compelled to view SCP-XXXX further. When questioned, affected subjects tend to state that they find the image highly interesting or similar statements. Affected subjects may attempt to convince others to view SCP-XXXX; however, this is believed to be simply attempting to share something the subject finds interesting as per normal human behavior, rather than additional compulsion.   After a variable amount of sustained viewing, usually ranging from one to three hours, the subject loses interest in the photograph image and instead becomes fixated on their surroundings, which take on the distorted quality of the photograph image in the subject's perception. This effect wears off after an amount of time roughly equal to the time spent viewing SCP-XXXX. During this time, the creatures depicted in the photograph image are able to interact with the world, partially extruding into three-dimensional space; however, they are unable to break contact with or move SCP-XXXX, limiting the risk they pose. If humans are included in the scene, they will not [REDACTED]. Viewing SCP-XXXX further during this period has no effect on either the original subject or additional observers.  Incident Report XXXX-1: While viewing SCP-XXXX, the subject used a mobile phone to take a picture of SCP-XXXX, and uploaded it to █████ before researchers could interfere. The digital image had the same properties as the original photograph, resulting in [REDACTED] cases of exposure. Class-C amnestics were administered to all exposed. Containment procedures amended to prevent further incident.  Incident Report XXXX-2: SCP-XXXX was accidentally viewed by Researcher ████, and showed SCP-███. The exposure proceeded to the second stage after less than one minute, far more quickly than the typical one to three hours; however, this stage lasted for a full hour despite the short first stage. Whether this was due to the properties of SCP-XXXX or SCP-███ is unknown. The resulting containment breach caused [DATA EXPUNGED]. All testing on SCP-XXXX suspended. Object upgraded to Euclid classification."

In my opinion, your idea seems clichèd and quite boring; please do not let that discourage you. Believe me it's an OK idea, but you need an excellent idea if you really want to feel proud of your work. Start writing down ideas. I have a note page in my phone about 1500 words long just full of random thoughts and ideas, mostly about stories and poetry, but I also have a few SCP ideas that I'll write up soon. One's own ideas are the easiest to use, I find, because he or she can easily analyze and perfect them.   The most important rule: READ THE RULES AND READ SCP ARTICLES. First, check out the articles that are about to be deleted to see what not to do. Read what people in the discussion (comments) are saying. The rules are flexible, but stick by them if you want to do well. Also, there's an article somewhere on the tropes of SCP articles and tales, but I can't remeber what it's called. The source of your idea has a lot of potential. Don't think of an idea and fit it to a source, rather, get a source and generate ideas from it (hence the term: source). Try and figure out more ideas about the source, or just make up new ideas altogether (or with a new source).   Also, make sure your grammar is correct and speak with an elevated vocabulary to best fit the style of The Foundation; that is, an academic and/or scholarly style.  Practice makes perfect, so start now."

If you're going for a more elite MTF soldier that would've been part of high-level operations, then you can also look at things like the M1 Carbine, Sterling SMG, and De Lisle carbine, which were used in smaller numbers by specialized units."

Maybe if you added some more interesting or inexplicable properties, and a good backstory, it would be better. As well, your writing lacks clinical tone (although I assume this is just a mock up rather than a draft) and has several examples of strange cubic containment procedures, which are a huge first time cliche. Do you know how tall 7 meters is? If you took the tallest man in the world, cloned him, and had the clone stand on the original's shoulders, the clone would still have half a meter between him and the ceiling. Besides, defining exact dimensions of the room are generally considered unnecessary unless the object's properties will only be contained in a room of that exact dimension, which is a relatively rare anomaly. ""Standard containment chamber"" does nicely. Finally, I don't think that this would be euclid, it seems safe.  It's definitely a clear first attempt, but work on it some more, take what I've said into consideration, continue to get feedback on your drafts. Consider going onto the IRC chat for critique later, there are often a few experienced writers willing to take a look!  EDIT: Turns out I got the ""tallest person in the world"" math a bit wrong. In fact, if you stacked two of him on top of each other as described, the clone would have not half a meter to the ceiling but around two and a half meters. He wouldn't be able to even touch the ceiling with his arms. In fact, you could put a third clone on there and he might only have to bend his head a little. The point is: 7 meters is really really tall. Too tall. And that's why cubic rooms are stupid."

SCP,39d4tj,doughcastle01,5,Thu Jun 11 04:15:42 2015 UTC,"More to the point, if you read through the site, there are a number of SCPs that find a way. There's a lot of SCPs that include ""And we did the obvious thing to cheaply contain/destroy it and HOLY CRAP ow ow ow my spleen ok that was a bad idea.""  SCPs are, in general, not of this world, and in a lot of ways, we just don't know what would happen if we shot 096 into space. That's why the SCP Foundation is the SCP Foundation, and not the Chaos Insurgency or something.  (Which is not to say the SCP Foundation is automatically right, just because they are, broadly speaking, our POV character into that meta-universe... but there's certainly a lot of evidence that they aren't just wrong.

Is it run and don't look at it, try to get a) farther than the next closest person and b) outside of tactical detonation range?  How many SCP's are there that will ignore you if you don't look at them vs how many you HAVE to look at?  I'm pretty sure if you duck into a corner and never look at shyguy's face, as long as you aren't directly in its way its gonna pass you up."

SCP,39d4tj,HumidNebula,3,Fri Jun 12 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"That's a bit silly. Even low Earth orbit is several miles up, and he can only run, at most, 100 miles an hour. Even if he climbed Mt.

I just did a little googling, having remembered that Shy Guy can easily outrun Foundation helicopters.  The world record for helicopter speed is ~250 mph.  I image the Foundation having some ultra shiny helicopters that can if not match that, at least approach it.  But even if they can only go half that fast, his max speed being 100 mph doesn't exactly math."
SCP,39d4tj,The-Paranoid-Android,3,Thu Jun 11 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"Granted, I just guessed on the top speed of the helicopter. I'm just trying to be consistent within the mythos. If you want 096 to jump into orbit then go ahead."

Though it talks about the Scarlet King, this is a red herring that is admitted in the sixth iteration of the file. It explains how the ritual has to be ""Incorporating references to similar but unrelated occult entities."" This gives the illusion that they know more about this thing than they do.  But there is one connection that refutes this. The Erikesh Codex says how that guy and his army of 1000 carved the chains from the bones of ""JASPETAR, SEVENTH BRIDE OF THE DREAD DEVOURER"". Could SCP-231-7 be that seventh bride? Could SCP-231-7 give birth to that seventh bride?  Who knows? We're probably screwed regardless."

Sure, it may be reality bending to a degree, but things only happen if you follow certain steps. Perhaps the extra, unscripted scenes in SCP-701 mean that the collective audience and performers are shifted into an alternate reality controlled by the entity present in SCP-701.

SCP,38umy3,astupidho,8,Sat Jun 6 23:40:40 2015 UTC,"I'll leave feedback!  I'll be honest; that promo you guys put out a short while back? It almost totally sold me against the idea of listening to this. But I support fan content, especially podcasts, so I was willing to give this a shot.  The idea of people going in and giving their thoughts and theories on SCP articles while not knowing much about the wiki or the writing is admittedly a strange one. You're going to encounter wildly different styles from a number of authors during different periods, so that's something to take in mind. Maybe even just look through some of the most highly-rated objects? I mean, hell, that could be an episode in of itself if you wanted, but you are getting into a site with over 2500 articles, including joke SCPs. It'd be good to at least have a base understanding!  From the start, I was intrigued by listening to you guys talk about anqxyr's 1797, though it was odd and puzzling to hear the end of that segment, when you mentioned all the vague possibilities of that article, yet came to the conclusion that it wasn't fleshed out. Yeah, it's probably not that fleshed out, but with all the theories and thought you guys put into it by dissecting each piece of it... I'd say the article did a perfectly good job of it. It is also the author's third SCP made, so they aren't exactly new to it :P (Also, it's You-klid, and Ket-er, when you run into those.)  Hearing you take on 1871 is interesting as well, and you're right; the title of the skip is indeed ""Vorpal Sword"" (in addition to being a rewrite of an old deleted article called ""Vorpal Sword""; you can see it here). I'm going to also say that you guys should totally sign up and apply for membership for the SCP Wiki to get in touch with authors and spread the podcast easier by making a thread for it. You'll get a lot better feedback that way and more people interested in this and maybe even being on this.  809 is an interesting SCP article to tackle; it's definitely an old one (a relic even; 2009!) and many of the issues pointed out is stuff that's simply not done today in articles for one reason or another (here, it's the ""Foundation is dickish for no reason"" trope). As far as:   We don't know anything about the Foundation's goals besides securing, containing, and protecting.   it's to preserve the world's normalcy and status quo. That's ultimately the endgoal of the SCP Foundation. They're scientific and collect data and analyze stuff, but they do it to protect the world and keep it normal. It's something explored in several articles and tales. ""They science because they have to"" is totally a good point to hit on. You talk about GOC and ORIA, and there's a list of all the Groups of Interest the Foundation encounters here. (I don't know if I should be rambling about this over giving you feedback, but then again, I'm tired and it's late here :P) (Though you do mention wanting to know more talking about the basic information in the Foundationverse).  981 is a good article to dive in, and I'll update this post as I keep listening to it.  EDIT: Apparently, you guys missed the interview due to poor formatting. If you wanna look at it and see if it adds anything for you, you can read it now :P  I love the discussion here. The spitballing abut what's going on in 981... hell, you guys reached conclusions I never even realized. Really thinking about these and analyzing them in ways authors probably haven't... that's great.  I enjoy this. I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. Emailing might be inconvient, so I'm leaving feedback in here and encouraging one (or both) of you to apply for membership to the SCP wiki and start a thread to share the podcast and have people give insights."
SCP,38umy3,ErnulaxCuilan,6,Sun Jun 7 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"Hey, Ratking here (I know that's quite the claim to make, but astupidho/Ganymede can vouch for me).  We actually realized quite a few of the things you addressed, particularly the fact that we jumped in without even, as you put it, a ""base understanding"". During the editing of this episode, I actually did a lot of research on classifications, pronunciations, groups of interest etc. for us to peruse, study, and keep on hand for reference, so we'll be going into the next episode with a much more stable understanding of the material! While I appreciate your comments on what interesting choices we made, I have to blow the lid on this: we chose ENTIRELY at random. I'm really happy with the ones we wound up with, they were all really interesting and covered a wide spectrum of styles, but we can't in any good conscience take credit for that :p As for 981s interview, I'm actually REALLY interested in looking over that, and I'm not 100% certain how we missed it. I'm really happy you brought that to our attention though; I can't make any promises without talking it over with Ganymede, but going back to cover things we missed and listener input is something we really want to make a habit of, so there's a good chance we'll be visiting that sometime soon. Finally, I want to just say that we really didn't realize the scope of SCP as a piece of fiction OR as a community, the fact that a tiny startup podcast got the attention it has in such a small amount of time is at heartwarming as it is amazing. I know this is a direct response ErnulaxCuilan, but I want to sincerely thank anyone reading this for the input or even just for listening."

SCP,38umy3,The-Paranoid-Android,2,Sun Jun 7 04:42:43 2015 UTC,"I know Ratking already addressed a lot of what you said but I wanted to additionally thank you for such thorough feedback!  We were so blind going into episode 1 that we really appreciate such a detailed breakdown (from a clearly enthusiastic fan of SCP!) of what we can improve on.  As RK mentioned we've got a sort of primer now that puts us in a slightly more knowledgeable position, and I like that.  There are a few facets of the show which I feel are important, and entering with minimal background is one of them.  As it stands I think we have a show that appeals jointly to fans of the community and utter newcomers.  It's like watching a group of ignorant hooligans explore a haunted house.  Half the audience knows the house is haunted and is anticipating ghosts the explorers don't know about, and the other half is just along for the ride.  It's important to me to maintain that, but episode 1 was eye-opening in that we didn't even have enough context to provide more interesting commentary or speculation.  The other facet is the random nature of our article selection, which I think makes things fresh and interesting and keeps people on their toes.  Two workarounds I'm considering are as follows:   1) Picking randomly from different sections of the site, such as Tales, which might be more likely to provide context.  2)Devoting a little bit of time at the start of the episode (maybe in lieu of our first segment) to compiling and discussing dossier-style information about the foundation and its workings.  But anyway, thank you so much for your input!  Audio should be noticeably better for the next episode, and thanks to feedback like this I'm hoping our content will follow suite.  :3"

Kind of the opposite goes for iTunes; I kinda of have my gripes with it as a service and would prefer not to deal with them, however that doesn't indicate any decision we may make together and, of course, I just want to see this project grow.  As for the title, I like it; Super Cool Podcast shortening to SCP really just get an internal giggle out of me. I love switching out the words an acronym stands for.

Also the manner of death is a bit too complicated. You could have omitted the ""unknown chemical"" thing as it doesn't really contribute to anything. Dragged, hung from a tree, and stoned to death is just fine and makes them seem sinister enough. The angels should be something a bit less mysterious than this. Something that the foundation can never catch seems cool, but can be really boring if it isn't done right. Make it that there is some way to communicate with them, or maybe temporarily contain them."

SCP,38s7eh,NobleKale,2,Sat Jun 6 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"SCP ####'s current whereabouts are unknohiwn    SCP Z's current whereabouts remain unknown   so containment is not possible at this time   This is kind of obvious, if they don't know where it is they can't contain it.   Every police report related to death similar to the effects of SCP #### are to be studied and the location tracked down a searched for SCP ####.   Current recovery efforts are to focus on analysis of police reports aimed at deaths with similar circumstances to the effect of SCP Z   All deaths are to be covered up as suicide until further notice.   This is clumsy - things like this would actually lead to statistical spikes in suicidal deaths which would actually arouse suspicion. Surely the Foundation has a protocol for covering this stuff up already.   When a case of SCP #### is found, it is to be kept in a humaniod containment cell, with no human contact whatsoever.   In the event of discovery of SCP Z, it is to be relocated by remote access drone to a standard humanoid containment cell. It is not to be approached directly by personnel.   during parties and things along that line   This is where I'm gonna stop.   Tone really, really needs to be addressed.   Summary: It's an X that takes people away and kills them. There's no hook, and there's no emotional intrigue. Right now, it's pretty boring. Seems like you might be attempting a play on words for the drug Angel Dust or something, but it's not working out at all.  Humanoid/sentient SCPs are very, very, very difficult to do well because people forget: They need some form of motive/drive. Right now, you could replace the angel/drug entirely with a vacuum cleaner that has the same effect.   As for the interview: If someone at a party seems convinced they met someone when they clearly didn't, they'd be checked into rehab/a psych ward."

I've heard compelling arguments both ways on whether or not there is an actual SCP here to speak of, or whether it was meant to be a hidden repository for this information.

But it is hazardous and it is a threat to normality, since it's  proof of unending torture in the afterlife. It would cause mass panic in the world if it were revealed. So, in line with the Foundation's principles, that is something they would secure and contain, to protect humanity from the terrible truth.  In that way, 2718 would almost be a deconstruction of how most people view memes and cognitohazards, a more... literal take on them. Dangerous ideas, hazardous information.

(After Object Class) the faithful watch the forest for the coming of the King. their lanterns bright, they wait at night for the new world he shall bring.  (Site and Personnel Requirements)  the dragon waits in shadows, his breath will scorch the land. the hero in the castle draws his sword and makes his stand.  the princess in the tower is hidden far away. but nothing under heaven can keep The Groom at bay.  they gather round with leering smiles, the soulless and the dead. though her soul unwinds, the cruelest minds will keep her in her bed.  (Special Containment Procedures) the potter told his 'prentice to prepare him seven jars. six he made with grace and skill, the last his hands did mar.  the cretin moon no more is howling, gone its mourning black. in their dreams its face is prowling, come to take them back.  (Description)  the King is in his courting clothes, the brides are in their beds. the unborn princes wait in sleep to raise their eager heads.  the hens were in the henhouse and seven eggs did lay, till the fox crept in by dark of night and stole the eggs away.  six were broken by their bindings six no more shall sing. comes the seventh full unwinding and all the bells will ring.

(After description of SCP 231-3) his bride the third remained unheard, her cries for help ignored. she stopped her life with a surgeon's knife, and gave it to Our Lord.  (After description of SCP 231-4) the fourth prepares a dagger and places it at her heart. the perfect cure cannot make pure what the King has set apart.  (After description of SCP 231-5) the fifth one's crown was bearing down upon the fox's set. the den was sundered with mighty thunder, an apocalypse beget.  (After description of SCP 231-6) on the sixth's day, the walls gave way, and the oceans turned to ash. her birth gave work, as the earth shook, underneath the King's fell lash  (After description of SCP 231-7) the seventh bride will break the tides the moon no more will shine. there comes a day not far away she'll birth the death of time.

SCP,37g03f,BlackFerretC,13,Wed May 27 20:04:14 2015 UTC,"Item #: SCP-3946-J  Object Class: Keter  Special Containment Procedures:   [Invalidated as of ███████].  [Invalidated as of ███████].  [Invalidated as of ███████].  Revised Containment Procedures: As of this update, SCP-3946-J is re-classified as Keter due to the difficulty of containing SCP-3946-J.  Any sightings or evidence of SCP-3946-J, SCP-3946-J-1, or SCP-3946-J-2 are to be reported immediately to the current head of Site 19 immediately. At least 10 plainclothes agents should be dispatched to the area to prevent SCP-3946-J-1 from obtaining whatever rogue SCP exists in the area. Communication with SCP-3946-J-1 is to be supervised by at least three (3) Level 4 Personnel. Communication with SCP-3946-J-1 should be done with plainclothes SCP agents. Under no circumstances should SCP-3946-J be informed of the SCP's presence.  If SCP-3946-J-1 is ever sighted twice consecutively without SCP-3946-J-2, enact protocol 3946-J-A.  Description: SCP-3946-J is a British police telephone box, consistent in size and coloring  with the style of boxes built in the late 1920's. The doors of SCP-3946-J can only be opened by SCP-3946-J-1. When opened, SCP-3946-J appears to contain a space much larger than the dimensions of the box. The appearance of the inside of SCP-3946-J varies from sighting to sighting, but always contains a central tower surrounded by various levers and buttons.  SCP-3946-J appears and disappears seemingly at random, but tends to favor appearing near other unconstrained SCP's.  Once appearing, SCP-3946-J extrudes one to two entities, SCP-3946-J-1 and (usually, but not always) SCP-3946-J-2. If SCP-3946-J-2 is not seen for 2 consecutive appearances of SCP-3946-J-1, enact protocol 3946-J-A.  SCP-3946-J-1 is a male humanoid. The appearance of SCP-3946-J-1 varies from sighting to sighting, but has maintained one of 10 11 12 13 different appearances.  SCP-3946-J-1 is hostile towards SCP operatives, but is friendly towards normal individuals. When facing hostile individuals, SCP-3946-J-1 will begin speaking to those individuals. The content of the speech varies from occurrence to occurrence; SCP-3946-J-1 may attempt to dissuade hostiles from harming it, or it may deliver a lengthy, convoluted speech with no apparent purpose (other than to distract the hostiles and thus prevent them from taking action). Whatever the content of the speech, SCP-3946-J-1 is consistently able to prevent harm to itself (and SCP-3946-J-2) simply by speaking.  Current theories postulate that SCP-3946-J-1's speech is a low-level cognitohazard that renders individuals hostile to SCP-3946-J-1 unable to harm it. However, no controlled tests to prove this theory have yet been possible, due to the difficulty inherent in containment of SCP-3946-J-1 (and the chaotic nature of most non-contained interactions with SCP-3946-J-1)  SCP-3946-J-1 is also capable of producing devices from any pockets it currently possesses. Devices range from wands capable of altering reality to documents proclaiming SCP-3946-J-1 to belong to the SCP foundation.   SCP-3946-J-1 will attempt to secure any rogue SCP's in the area. Any SCP's secured by SCP-3946-J-1 are taken back into SCP-3946-J, which then dissapears. Nothing is known of what happens to any rogue SCP's taken by SCP-3946-J, but due to the Keter classification of SCP-3946-J and it's hostility towards the Foundation, agents are granted allowances when preventing SCP-3946-J-1 to obtaining any rogue SCP's.  SCP-3946-J-2 is a female humanoid. The appearance of SCP-3946-J-2 various from sighting to sighting, but tends to take the appearance and personality of the last individual who stepped into SCP-3946-J (See protocol 3946-J-A).  Protocol 3946-J-A: Should SCP-3946-J-1 be sighted without SCP-3946-J-2 on two or more consecutive appearances, agents should locate a female human between the ages of 20-30. For best results, the female should maintain a ""spunky, go-getter attitude"" and be attractive according to current social norms. The female should be mind-wiped of all SCP knowledge and placed within a metropolitan city with a suitable Euclid-class SCP that is capable of being retrieved. In most cases, once the female has been threatened by the released SCP, SCP-3946-J will appear. Once SCP-3946-J has extruded SCP-3946-J-1 and dealt with the ""rogue"" SCP, the female will enter SCP-3946-J and be transformed into SCP-3946-J-2. The euclid SCP should be retrieved if possible. For this reason, only low-risk SCP's should be used for protocol 3946-J-A.  Warning: Should Protocol 3946-J-A not be enacted, SCP-3946-J-1 will become increasingly hostile and irresponsible in it's attempts to contain rogue SCP's.Due to the world-altering power of SCP-3946-J-1 and it's various devices, this could result in a Keter-class end of the world scenario.

SCP-3120's anomalous effects only occur when connected to an appropriate CCTV management system, or IP network.  Under no circumstances should the SCP be allowed to connect with the internet.  Description: SCP-3120 appears to be a normal CCTV pan-tilt domed security camera of SAMSUNG origin.  The SCP was discovered when an external entity was traced to be conducting searches online using keywords from the foundations library of redacted information.  The external entity confessed to being a security guard posted in the CCTV room where they were employed.  normal memetic wipes were performed and the guard was release.  The retrieval team then located the SCP connected to a series of newly installed security equipment.  Instead of showing the normal field of vision, the camera seems to attempt to show the highest security system's most sensitive recording device it can reach.  In the case of the guard, it showed internal monitoring of the foundation's redacted library.  Exactly how the SCP establishes this connection is unknown.  To how many feeds the camera outputs to is also unknown, but tends to bias to the nearest relevant monitoring station to the SCP. Containment of the SCP to ensure the security of the foundation's sensitive information is recommended.  Use of the SCP for espionage is theorized, but until containment of the video output can be confirmed no operations are to be planned."

Initially, he would start in the dragonbook, but as he can travel between books, and their will likely be other books nearby to the dragonbook, we can expect Fred to go travelling.  If then, we cannot find Fred after we have found the dragonbook it is possible he may be lost.    It is also possible Fred would appear as an actual entity within the 826 environment, possibly with the ability to travel incredibly large distances, as the world exists based on the text of the book, and Fred changes the text of the book.

I'm confused. If one dies, neighboring ones will eat it. Fine. But the acid from said eating gets a reaction from the living ones? But the acid doesn't affect them.  ...They can cause an XK. And killed the dinosaurs. That is pretty ridiculous.   Uhh… they are kinda big? Looks like those cartoon clams, you know? Big wavy shell, like a lip on top and really huge.   This is an MTF specializing in aquatic anomalies. They'd be knowledgeable enough to give a better description than this.   [EXPLETIVES REDACTED]   You can swear.  And that last log doesn't really add anything, and I'm curious why it would be put after the Foundation excursion.  I'm not familiar with the rock eating fish Markoswan mentioned, but I was somewhat reminded of SCP-1641.

SCP,36tqii,Ceraunius,1 point,Sat May 23 07:53:43 2015 UTC,"Right. Gonna fix that. I was blacking out the subspecies, but I should probably leave it out.   As for the defensive response, the idea is the swarm intelligence reacting like that due to the breakdown of the shell that, without an inhabitant, will also be vulnerable to the acid. Detection of the shell's decomposition will then lead to a defensive secretion of the surrounding clam's acid mix which dissolves vacant shells further away which triggers defense in those near THAT shell.  I'll think about a less retarded alternative.   While I realize that Theta-5 is a marine task force, the grunts are, to my mind,  not necessarily scientists. But if that is not canon, I will fix it.  Another thing is that this XK event is not a nuke. If you read the linked extinction event, it was a slow but steady process due to global changes in water and atmosphere. As long as there are not 5 super-freighters crashing into the reef in 3 minutes it should be fine.

Information can be obtained through any means, but the effect needs to be based on the information itself rather than the source of the information or some physical aspect of the context.   For example: A memetic SCP could be an idea, written on a stone obelisk, buried in an ancient Mesopotamian ziggurat that causes one to believe they are a Babylonian slave, and must construct additional obelisks, communicating the SCP in all languages that the slave knows.

Decide on a classification, don't leave it pending. You essentially left the whole article in mid-writing.  You are missing a lot of commas. Proofread this a few more times, you have a lot of run-on sentences.  The potential that the skip poses seems out of place in the description. Put this in an addendum or something. The description should just describe the object, not what researchers think it could potentially do.  Typically you don't want to use previously established characters' names in your articles unless you have permission from the owner of those characters.  I don't understand the point of the addendum. If there are no containment procedures, why do we need to focus on them?  Also, now that I think about it, this sounds a bit like http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-335"

SCP,36l8yo,Ceraunius,2,Wed May 20 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"Right, so, it needs a lot of work. There are numerous punctuation errors and some sentences that are worded rather poorly.  After re-reading it a few times I'm not sure what, exactly, the article is trying to paint the SCP in question as. Is it dangerous? Because everything up until the note at the end makes it seem like it's harmless, and the note feels very out of place compared to the rest of the article. The initial classification of Keter is unnecessary. I know a lot of new articles try to use Keter as a ""LOOK AT ME!"" tag, but I don't see it being justified here.  The bit about producing a copy of any and all documents is decently interesting, but calling such a thing ""disturbing"" is laying it on too thick. It makes it sound like you're reaching for some kind of creepy/horror page when the rest of the entry is mundane.  Finally, the Addendum at the end says to focus on containment procedures, which seems like an unnecessary bit to throw in there, especially since the containment procedures in question are basically non-existent."
SCP,36l8yo,Ceraunius,1 point,Wed May 20 09:29:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude! I will keep this in mind next time :).

Also there is actually  a site like this i just exaggerated it's depiction."
SCP,36l8yo,Ceraunius,3,Wed May 20 09:34:09 2015 UTC,"Wait, so is this website causing whatever is searched to be projected through the monitor or something? Because your note mentioned a D-class who became violently ill after reading about microbial fauna being ""too small"". Wouldn't microbial imply that they're small to begin with? Seeing them ""life sized"" wouldn't make them any bigger.  Did they jump from the document into his body? If so, why is this capability not mentioned in the description?  Also, I'd just drop the crossed-out Keter and Euclid ratings entirely. This doesn't seem particularly dangerous or difficult to contain.   Think of the rating system in terms of placing the SCP inside a box: if the SCP makes no attempt to escape the box, it's Safe. If it can escape the box under a specific set of circumstances, or if given the opportunity, it's Euclid. If it bashes through the box, kills fifteen researchers, and actively seeks to cause a murder orgy, it's Keter."

It was written by Otomo and Izo Hashimoto and based on Otomo's manga of the same name, focusing mainly on the first half of the story. The film depicts a dystopian version of Tokyo in the year 2019, with cyberpunk tones. The plot focuses on teenage biker Tetsuo Shima and his psychic powers, and the leader of his biker gang, Shotaro Kaneda. Kaneda tries to prevent Tetsuo from releasing the imprisoned psychic Akira. While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the original manga, the restructured plot of the movie differs considerably from the print version, pruning much of the last half of the manga.

I'm not sure if it would be fitting to have it so top secret. Like, there's something dedicated to destroying SCPs, why does it need to be kept secret? Sure there is the 'contain' part, but there are SCPs that are both hard to contain, and incredibly dangerous(like SCP-682 ). On these files, it's pretty well known that they're constantly attempting to destroy it, and with good reason.  If there is a good reason to destroy an item, then people will generally agree, it doesn't have to be kept top secret. Even the whole SCP-096 incident is well documented. I mean, I guess all the people on the site have Level 4 clearance technically, but still."
SCP,36ff8y,Xelipho,4,Tue May 19 00:35:23 2015 UTC,"One reason I thought of why this division would be secret is for morale purposes. The researchers and agents are getting killed/going insane/having otherwise horrible things happen to them every day in the name of containment and research, because the Foundation's missive to study anomalies outweighs how much less dangerous it might be to just launch them all into the sun. If they knew that they and their colleagues' real suffering could be prevented by this Termination Division, wouldn't that completely destroy morale at many levels within the Foundation? Especially among the agents; they're the literal cannon fodder oftentimes, and I think it would breed enormous resentment if they found out that they were fighting and dying because some higher-up decided not to assign the Termination Division to their particular SCP.  The secrecy makes tons of sense to me."

SCP,36ff8y,ShortShartLongJacket,2,Tue May 19 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking, but there are other angles to it too. Morale would be an issue, and at the same time research conducted by the Division on terminating some SCPs could cause an uproar, and actually also pose a risk for containment breach.   You have to keep in mind that several powerful SCPs are only in containment because they are simply allowing themselves to be, some because they do not expect harm to come to them. If the Division becomes common knowledge in the Foundation, several SCPs are extremely likely to cease cooperation. On top of that, mind controlling SCPs and rogue Foundation operatives could more easily gain access to the termination database. Imagine if a more intelligent SCP knew how to kill another SCP? Or if an agent that lost a team or family members to an SCP got into the system and killed an SCP the Foundation had no intention of killing? It would be a major disaster.  I work well with examples, so imagine this.  The Division, as part of basic procedure, will eventually develop a way to terminate the Blob. The cute little SCP that brings happiness to Foundation staff. That would cause an uproar if this fact is leaked and disturb morale.  If SCP-343, ""God"", found out that the Division has a contingency plan for its elimination, how likely do you think it is that 343 would cooperate with containment? Hell, 343 could become hostile if it knows that the Foundation is actively researching ways to terminate it , even as just a contingency.  The SCP that turned its assigned Foundation personnel into his minions? What would stop that SCP from covertly sending operatives to retrieve files on another SCP?  What if a Group of Interest infiltrates the Foundation and steals files from Termination?   There are too many factors that would make common knowledge of the Termination Division a major liability to Foundation operations and security."

SCP,36ff8y,The-Paranoid-Android,2,Tue May 19 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"I think you're making a casual assumption that is unjustified under most SCP canons... that the terminations will be successful, and generally free of side effects.  The SCP list is littered with the results of termination attempts, both intentional and otherwise. Yes, sometimes the object just kicks the bucket... but sometimes it becomes way worse, like SCP-1609. I also recall one that is the result of a site nuke going off, resulting in a whole bunch of statues in an ampitheatre being held by some other SCP until unspecified crimes are paid for, but I can't pull that one up on search. That's an unintentional termination gone wrong, but, at the same time, it could have gone even worse than it actually did.  I do not read the ""no terminations"" policy as something the SCP foundation started out with as a first principle... I read it as something they learned the hard way. Whatever the SCPs are, they, in general, do not respond politely to attempts to destroy them. Even really harmless ones can become something terrible, like the chair.   That said, I do agree that it's sensible to have such a division, and it would still need to be kept secret, actually, so it works out for the drama. This organization would have to have very high level access to lots of things to do their job, and just in general, the mere existence of people with such high access will not be very public knowledge. But that's more just a generalized operational security, and containment of potential memetic contaminations, rather than for morale versions."

SCP,36dlba,jerf,6,Mon May 18 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"Most of the time the Foundation keeps an eye on the sciences for notable academics with a lack of empathy and idealism. This is simple as the Foundation already has eyes and ears in every campus as they are hotbeds for experiment-originated anomalies. If a promising professional excels in their field, and shows to be lacking in empathy and idealism, the Foundation brings them in to work in one of the front companies. Now many of the fronts deal in the produce of or technology derived from SCPs, so indirectly, candidates are already being exposed to anomalous activity.   This is where it gets tricky. The Foundation is not looking for people who simply ask no questions, after all these are researchers. An uninquisitive researcher is completely useless. What the Foundation wants is someone who can ask all the right questions, quietly, questions about the material they're given to study, and definitely not the organization they work for.  If a researcher proves they can keep quiet about the insane results they're getting, and not dig into their org or go on a crusade against 'the conspiracy', they're good to hit L1. They go into the meeting, they get a pretty opaque proposal, with a good number of conditions attached. If they seem completely agreeable at that point they make the transition. It usually involves a number of drastic changes, but Foundation work is a bit too important and widespread to accomodate everyone's special needs. If any of the above doesn't happen, they get hit with an amnestic, their assignment gets transferred to another hopeful at the org, and  a short time later they are let go back into the job market. There's too many clues about Foundation activity floating around in those fronts for anyone to stick around in research too long.    Now with Agents, and SiteSec, it's completely different. They're mostly military, even with they come from private sources, as the better ones usually hire ex military. These lads and ladies have already been tested for loyalty and secrecy by their government to some degree, all one really needs to do is go over their service records and make a few reference calls. Most of these guys never lay eyes on anything remotely connected to the Foundation till they're already about to be approached. Some need a few trial runs, missions set up with their command or employer by the Foundation. But altogether it's a much less complicated process than finding new researchers, after all, these guys aren't meant to be read in on all the details.    Of course you always do have your typical trials by fire, personnel exposed to anomalous activity during a breach or initial containment scenario. Being instrumental in concluding these scenarios often gets the attention of recruiters, and the containment crew may get the call to skip amnestics for this or that party. Then they watch and wait to see if you fall apart or carry on in a manner befitting an operative of the Foundation. In the latter case they get The Call, from some untraceable source. It can either start here or at whatever meeting the subject is invited to, but eventually they start up the whole 'matrix' act, offering to tell them the truth about the anomalous activity if they can handle it and agree to be loyal, etc. If not, they get their long awaited Class B and a ride back home.    Class Ds come from the condemned, criminals to be executed (which there are more of worldwide than you think). The Foundation dummies up paperwork detailing their successful execution, death certificate, etc. It's the most convenient this way since an escaped D quickly finds they have no funds, legal status, or ability to register for anything as they are legally dead. Much easier to track. The Foundation either takes possession of the 'corpse', or in cases of anticipated dispute with the family, doctors up the corpse of a D Class of similar appearance to substitute. Another favored tactic is the 'morgue mistake' where the family is provided some random ashes in an urn and an apology. In cases where the demand for D Class outstrips the supply, there are protocols for non-condemned criminals to be pulled. They're supposed to be lifers, and they get a sudden barrage of transfers from prison to prison, until they simply get 'lost in the system': paperwork leads to a transfer loop, or a prison that doesn't exist.    Now there is a department within the Foundation, that deals with cases where someone linked to a newly inducted member starts digging into where they've gone to. Many times it's as easy as the new member to emphatically cut ties, but in many cases, especially overflow D-Class, the member has to just vanish. The problem of dissuading someone from searching for someone else is not one you can just throw amnestics at, as people turning up with amnesia about many years of life raises even more questions. Further, no clues can be given that there's a larger organization involved, they start to alert others and then you have a  big problem. What usually ends up happening is something personally injurious to the person digging, unfortunately; They have their life collapse on them, find themselves charged with a felony, or suffer actual injury, all very coincidental and not linked to their investigation. If this does not dissuade them, usually the Foundation has to terminate. It's unfortunate, but the work the Foundation does is more important than the truth, or individual lives."

I should elaborate on these guys, maybe an interview log. They are basically random people.  Also going to photoshop a real picture from a raffle with some misshapen faces."

SCP,36axa1,sgtillings,6,Sun May 17 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"I went on a bit of a out of context stock photo binge last night and ended up thinking about ways it could be SCP worthy. I have a small collection of just straight up insane stock photos (you can find them easily online) and this lead me to think about an entity that exists as a ever-expanding collection of stock photographs that begin in absolute insanity with any humans or objects in the photos acting completely unnaturally before over time becoming more and more normalised. Maybe the Foundation got involved when the photos began showing some kind of violent tendencies or a figure similar to those in SCP-701 or SCP-1981 began to appear.  Since they fell into Foundation hands the photos have been growing more violent and showing strange apocalyptic scenarios or have started to involve other entities that the Foundation currently holds.     EDIT: No idea what the watermark could be though, if someone could think up something surreal that could go on it that'd be amazing!"
SCP,36axa1,VirtualSquid,3,Sun May 17 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"I think apocalyptic scenarios are kind of uninteresting compared to the straight weirdness and context-less of stock photos. and people generally don't like it when you make vague references to SCPs that may or may not exist. The apocalypse and other SCPs are clearly bad, while a man shoving a banana into an exhaust pipe while leering into the camera with what appears to be a slight erection is...something."
