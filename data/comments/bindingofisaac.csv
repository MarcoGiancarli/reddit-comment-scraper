bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,leonissenbaum,13,Tue Jul 21 15:02:20 2015 UTC,"should be a 10% chance to reroll the item into poop instead of making it vanish.  .... you know, cuz it's shitty."
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,ElPared,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"I actually like this better. You can recover from poop if you get another full charge, if the pedestal completely disappears you're fucked. (Also it is my most hated change in the eternal update)"
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,DrunkenSQRL,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"I mean it would reroll into poop, not The Poop activated item."
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,ElPared,0,Tue Jul 21 18:27:57 2015 UTC,Then no one would take it though...
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,AllahuJackbar,4,Tue Jul 21 16:45:43 2015 UTC,how is removing an item pedestal altogether better than replacing it with poop?
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,Zatherz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"Poop can give an eternal heart, meaning you rerolled it into an hp up."
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,notwastingmyuber4u,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:19 2015 UTC,meaning that there would also be a very small chance to reroll into an HP up even if you already picked up every HP up in the game
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,Zatherz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"no one would take it as is.  Rerolling into poop is only slightly better than rerolling into nothing, even if poop can give you stuff.  More often than not it will give you nothing or a penny even with petrified poop."
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,ElPared,4,Tue Jul 21 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"Has a 10% chance of causing the item to vanish instead of getting rerolled.   For the love of God, NO.  As much as I appreciated Florian's work on WotL, that change pretty much spoilt the Eternal Update for me."
bindingofisaac,3e2rxi,Kidofthecentury,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I had the idea for the D600. It rerolls your starting stats (like Damage and Range), but keeps the modifiers.  For an example, lets take an Eden start with 1 bar of damage and the D600. Eden goes into the item room and gets Blood of the Matyre. Eden rerolls himself so his base damage is 3. Blood of the Matyre makes it 4 damage."

Then you play challenges and when you're blindfolded you will understand that Bob's Brain is your best friend. ""Cat Got Your Tongue""? ""Bob's Brain""? Hell yeah, give me that! And now it's not so bad. ""Such a good item, how could I think it's bad? Oh, how young and stupid I was"". Then you play as The Lost  , get Bob's Brain unknowingly (thank, Curse of the Blind) on your 424 attempt to beat at least one of the game branches and instantly kill yourself and you absolutely hate it now, more than red poops in Boss Rush arena or bullshit The Haunt damage. ""Never again""...  You have ""True Platinum God"" already for a long time. You play really casually and your run lacks spice (and damage). You see Bob's Brain. ""Why the hell not, it's not like I want to win this boring-ass run anyway"". Then you kill Mega-Satan.  It's never ""No"", it's always ""Maybe"". Unless you're The Lost and sane."

Depending on the number of red heart containers, you get the effect of either the Polaroid or Negative when you get hit. Each container will increase the chance of it happening. With 10 hearts, it will be 100%. They will happen at the same time at 12 hearts. It could lead to this or this."

bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,picklev33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"I mean there have been many ideas to encourage red heart use and a few ideas about a third path. Whether this stats-for-hearts buff (which is pretty simplistic) is the way to go, I'm not so sure. But hey many people have been suspecting that there will be a third path in Afterbirth (in some way connected to all the secret greed links), maybe there will be and maybe it will address this.  On the topic of the soul heart centric lategame though. I actually think people (and especially me) are overstating the frequency of soul heart only runs. Of course I'm not questioning the power of guaranteed polaroid procs (that + knife/strong orbital pretty much trivializes the whole endgame) But often you just get so many red heart containers and can't get rid of them or you can't afford to because you didn't get many soul hearts. Or you have that one last container remaining and hope to get rid of it in a Womb I devil room, but then there are only chests in it. Or you pick up a late Magic Mushroom and really need the damage. Or have curse of the blind on the chest and pick up the halo. So yeah... I guess some actual statistics would be useful because as long as the getting rid of containers is at least some sort of puzzle or weighing up of risk and reward (like, often I consider not picking up an hp up on Depths II and plan to pay any good devil deal on Womb I with soul hearts, which might backfire), it might not be as bad.  P. S.: Maybe my perspective has become skewed since I started doing Eden streaks."

bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,pure7777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:07 2015 UTC,"I thought about that, but I didn't just want to make it a version of the Negative."
bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,pure7777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:19 2015 UTC,Angel rooms should guarantee a random stat increase upon entry as long as you enter the room.
bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,joshburnsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:47 2015 UTC,Maybe instead of a devil/angel room you could just get a room with chests with different requirements to open with guaranteed item room/shop items?
bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,joshburnsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:17 2015 UTC,"That would be interesting, but this is more about Sheol/Cathedral split than Devil v Angel rooms."
bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,joshburnsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:09 2015 UTC,"The concept of ""paths"" is a bit skewed IMO.  Since deals with the devil set a precedent and angel deals do not, there's really only one path.  I get that, flavor-wise, this is meant to show that no matter how righteous and pure you are, you are always being tempted by evil, but I think it makes for unbalanced game design.  I think this could be remedied by Deals with the angel setting a precedent as well, BUT the difference between that and a devil precedent would be that, while you are guaranteed angel rooms from then on, there's still a chance you will get a devil room in addition to the angel room.  Entering the devil room causes the angel room to disappear and vice versa even with Goat Head or Book of Belial.  I also think that if a Third path were to exist it should be very difficult to maintain.  My idea for a third path would be a Zen path.  The room would be half devil room, half cathedral, with a large Yin-Yang symbol in the middle.  You would be offered two items, one devil, one angel, and both would cost one of each heart type (except Eternal) and taking one makes the other disappear like There's Options.  There would also be some Zen Room pool items that would appear there as well and would be the only item there.  These rooms only appear if you have an equal amount of red hearts, soul hearts and black hearts and can only be forced to appear if that condition is met (IE with Goat Head they still won't appear unless you meet the condition).  my three cents anyways."
bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,Hungerwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"By paths, I don't mean deals. I mean the Cathedral ""path"" and the Sheol ""path"", and how by going to one floor you don't go down the other. The game has this split, and taking the polaroid or the negative pretty much determines which one you'll want to go on if you want to reach the end. I am advocating a third set of floors where the final floor requires you to take an item pickup, similar to polaroid or negative, that instead encourages red hearts."
bindingofisaac,3e1qjf,sjackser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"Well the path is chosen for getting rid of all red hearts, what if a third path was available for having no soul hearts or black hearts? Something in the middle of the current two paths, heaven and hell. A purgatory path, which leads to two new bosses as well."
bindingofisaac,3e2pep,InstaCakes,4,Tue Jul 21 14:30:13 2015 UTC,"Krampus can spawn on any floor (except Womb 2, obviously), regardless of if you can normally access the Devil Room or not (basement 1, post-Womb)."
bindingofisaac,3e2pep,purehatred89,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:31 2015 UTC,Ah. I thought he only appeared after you took a Devil Deal. So it's just a higher chance if that's the case?
bindingofisaac,3e2pep,InternationalCow,3,Tue Jul 21 14:49:36 2015 UTC,It is more likely. Chance of Krampus goes up after taking a deal

Triachnid is a reference to the game of the same name, in which a three-legged spider creature transport its egg sac through hostile terrain. Gish was the protagonist of his own game, also called Gish. Vis are inspired by a boss from Gish, The Vis Sisters. C.H.A.D. and Larry Jr. are both related to bosses from Super Meat Boy.
