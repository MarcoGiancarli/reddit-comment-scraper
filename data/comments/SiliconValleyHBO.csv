T.J took a (presumably comedic) jab at someone and she gets outraged and feels like she has to heckle? I don't know the whole story by the article, but it seems like she was being a bitch."
SiliconValleyHBO,3dt3ux,BittahDemon,7,Sun Jul 19 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"Also, the remark by twitter exec about not bringing her daughter seems dumb or at the very least ignorant. I don't know how old her daughter is, but if she is a kid, you NEVER take them to a stand-up performance unless it is explicitly said that its okay to get kids. If anything the anger should be directed at the organizers, since clearly it seems that these people did not want stand-up like hosting style from Miller.   Additionally, while this is only tangentially relevant,  does anyone else think the whole activism behind banning specific words based on some individual experiences is really shallow ? (Personally, I think we are well rid of the N-word, but the logic behind that definitely does not extend to all the arbitrary words so-called SJWs choose to ban this month) Sexism, bullying and intimidation is not about specific words, its about how people are treated. Thinking that banning specific words would even put a dent in sexism is like thinking paracetamol can cure malaria."

SiliconValleyHBO,3dg89v,042376x,3,Thu Jul 16 06:44:36 2015 UTC,"While it would be ridiculous to expect every show to do that, there is still an issue with the fact that most shows with large casts still have disproportionately more straight white men than the actual real world does. It can be kind of shitty when you aren't part of the ""default"" to have most TV shows either pretending you don't exist or only using you as a punchline. And there aren't that many shows focusing on other parts of the population to balance those ones out.  I think that happens because writers draw more from their own experiences and issues that are visible in their life, and TV writing still isn't representative of the whole population either. So it's just not something they're as consciously aware of unless people start telling them about it, which is why I'm glad people do talk about it. When you aren't living something, it's easy to dismiss it as an optional extra. Like you only need a black or gay character if you have a specific ""reason"" to have one, and otherwise you'll just default to writing every new character as straight and white until you need them to be something else or have a specific actor in mind. That is a problem, because it shows that we are still far from equality.  Also, something tells me that there are LGBT people in the actual Silicon Valley. Just maybe. So I wouldn't mind knowing where they are in a show that aims to be as true to reality as possible in depicting the place.  Silicon Valley is one of my favourite shows of all time, but I don't see why that should make it immune from criticism. I hate when people take that kind of defensive attitude to media - saying that there's a problem with representation in a show/movie/game doesn't mean you think that thing is bad or that you think the people who made it were deliberately sexist/racist/homphobic. That said, it's not a show I tend to focus on for that kind of criticism because it intentionally satirises the sexism and racism in Silicon Valley culture with great effectiveness, and the composition of the cast is a part of that."
SiliconValleyHBO,3dg89v,Inequilibrium,2,Fri Jul 17 12:19:40 2015 UTC,"I would say Silicon Valley has a relatively small cast Why does it have to be shitty? When I watch The Cosby Show or Will And Grace or The Fresh Prince, I'm not concerned or offended that straight, white men are hardly present or used as a punchline. Can't we just ignore it and enjoy media regardless of what segmentations of humanity are present? Isn't that exaaaaactly what antidiscrimination is about?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3dg89v,TheDaveWSC,0,Fri Jul 17 13:08:04 2015 UTC,"I would say Silicon Valley has a relatively small cast   Not sure what you're comparing it to, but the main cast is a pretty decent size, and taking into account recurring characters in season 2 it's been getting quite big. So if they're bringing in new characters, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect the cast to become more statistically representative.   Why does it have to be shitty? When I watch The Cosby Show or Will And Grace or The Fresh Prince, I'm not concerned or offended that straight, white men are hardly present or used as a punchline. Can't we just ignore it and enjoy media regardless of what segmentations of humanity are present? Isn't that exaaaaactly what antidiscrimination is about?   There's no culture or history that treats white people as inferior to black people, straight people as inferior to gay people, etc. You aren't being ignored by those shows, they're just exceptions to the rule. They aren't reinforcing any societal norms or attitudes that harm those groups because those are majority groups that have always had power and greater social status. Pretending that diversity doesn't exist isn't ""antidiscrimination"", it's erasure. It goes back to what I said about straight white male being the ""default"", and everything else having to be a conscious choice.  It actually does matter to a lot of people that they can see people like themselves on TV, because if they can't, they tend to be treated as abnormal, or as stereotypes. If you've never had this problem, then no, you aren't going to care and it's easy to say it doesn't matter, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't matter to other people or that they're wrong for caring. The criticism of poor representation is more about an average across all TV shows and all movies - as in ""oh, yet another show about straight white guys"" - so isolated examples don't mean much.  It also does impact the quality of the show, because more diverse writers and characters can lead to more diverse kinds of stories and jokes that haven't already been done a thousand times before. The way Silicon Valley uses Kumail Nanjiani is actually a good example."
SiliconValleyHBO,3dg89v,Inequilibrium,0,Fri Jul 17 13:27:38 2015 UTC,"Also, if you Google ""why does representation matter?"" (no quotes) or anything along those lines, you will come up with a fuckload of articles that provide counterarguments to that viewpoint better than I could."
SiliconValleyHBO,3dg89v,Inequilibrium,5,Fri Jul 17 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"My thought exactly. People were crying about no women in Pied Piper, they got one token who had like a quarter of an episode of total airtime and that was it, and people are on to the next thing.  If we have to misrepresent the demographic bias in Silicon Valley, the show will end up like TBBT where everyone is a stereotype and look how that progressive that turned out.  The truly subversive thing to do would be to have an LGBT character and not make it about that.  tl;dr: Have Jared come out as bi and let my life be complete."

SiliconValleyHBO,3dhyrc,superjeffbridges,2,Thu Jul 16 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"Erlich is the worst part of the show for me. And as recently as the arbitration episode, he was still massively pissing me off - through his sheer stupidity, he causes so many of the problems Richard and others are constantly having to deal with (and being blamed for), and still accepts zero responsibility and rarely does anything to help."

He is the sole individual with confidence and charisma, so even though he's a twat they let him do his thing. Look at the scene with the kimono. Richard is visibly annoyed with the situation but it's easier to just go along with it than to try to resist...Erlich is not someone you want to try to get in a verbal spate with.

SiliconValleyHBO,3dhyrc,monty6447,6,Thu Jul 16 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he's a complete piece of shit. You're not laughing with him, you're laughing at him and how truly horrible he is. Erlich isn't quite as bad (he does have at least a few redeeming qualities), but the point of the character is to laugh at him being a fuckwit. If you don't find that funny, all it really boils down to is that humour is subjective."

SiliconValleyHBO,3dhyrc,EndingEons,3,Fri Jul 17 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. When I first started watching, I couldn't help but think ""wow this guy is an asshole."" But after watching the rest, you can tell that, yes he is an obnoxious asshole who cares for himself before others, he does care a lot about Richard and the others. Now when he does stuff I love him and can't get enough.   The homicide episode is a perfect example of where he's useful. When he was there he got negotiations happening, whereas when it was just Richard, double asshole tried to walk all over him.   Like someone else said, all the other guys are pushovers (Gilfoyle isn't a pushover, he just... He's Gilfoyle) so Erlich is useful when it comes to confrontations and talking/being social."
SiliconValleyHBO,3dhyrc,kazcovic,2,Sat Jul 18 04:45:00 2015 UTC,"He's awful in the beginning and he's still an obnoxious douche canoe through the season 2 finale. That doesn't mean he's not funny.

I then could pretty much go through most of Season 2, with only waiting a week for the last 3 or so episodes.  Now I need to wait nearly a year. Fuck.

IMO, it wouldn't be some massive breakthrough like FTL capabillity. Going on how the three commas have already occured it's a relatively reasonable product that everyone ends up needing. You're not gonna make a trillion with a new type of pen or disposable razor and you're not going to make a trillion from spaceships (or at least, you won't be the first one accross that mark). Discounting stocks, investments and getting the money from wise or clever descisions, that'll be the first person to cross the trillion mark. But talking about getting accross that mark off a personal invention or innovation? It's going to be something the equivalent of mobile phones, operating system software or huge websites with broad applications.

Before there were billionaires, I'm certain there would have been specualtion as to whether the mark would ever be crossed, so to speculate wether the trillion dollar mark might or might not be crossed is kind of redundant. I was also trying to make the discussion more relevant to the show (Sillicon Valley) by specualting how some tech or invention might make an individual a trillion dollars, rather than concentrating on people who might get there by investing or puchasing land. If i'd wanted to just talk about someone who passed the trillion dollar mark, then it would almost certainly be earnt, either through investing, or IMO quite possibly land ownership that combines with fresh water sources. The growing world population means that water is going to become a significantly more crucial resource over the next few decades than it is currently.

Their stated goal is to ""expand Earth's natural resource base""  by developing and deploying the technologies for asteroid mining.  Although the long-term goal of the company is to mine asteroids, its initial plans call for developing a market for small (30–50 kg) cost-reduced space telescopes for both Earth observation and astronomy. These spacecraft would employ a laser-optical system for ground communications, [citation needed] reducing payload bulk and mass compared to conventional RF antennas. [not verified in body] The deployment of such orbital telescopes is envisioned as the first step forward in the company's asteroid mining ambitions. The same telescope satellite capabilities that Planetary Resources hopes to sell to customers can be used to survey and intensively examine near-Earth asteroids.  Their first satellite, the Arkyd 3, was destroyed on October 28, 2014 after the Antares resupply rocket exploded seconds after launch.  The company's first satellite with an optical telescope—Arkyd-100—is set to launch in late 2015.

I may be badly wrong, but that kind of scale of engineering & space work doesn't seem likely in the next 50 years.

SiliconValleyHBO,3cu9vp,Thepaladinofchaos,3,Fri Jul 10 20:55:59 2015 UTC,Didn't the girl whose name I can't remember implement some smart p2p architecture so that the bandwidth on their servers was minimal?
SiliconValleyHBO,3cu9vp,Evulrabbitz,2,Fri Jul 10 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"Assuming their compression ratio is even 10x better than any previous versions, it still seems like a home internet connection couldn't handle more than a couple people streaming. I have 50mbps and still have trouble streaming more than one thing from my plex."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cu9vp,uuuuut,3,Sat Jul 11 01:40:37 2015 UTC,"They told the porn lady they can get down to 6mbps lossless. Elrich probably has a pretty serious pipe to his home for all the porn he consumes, so let's assume he has a 1gbps connection. Hypothetically, lossless 4K video is pointless to stream because you only need the bit ranges defined for colors visible to the eye on the screen -- you only need lossless if you're doing work on the exposure and color grading. A lossy h264 4K file plays around 40mbps. The original lossless 4K video would probably be around 900mbps, so the compresses size is 4.4% as large as the original. So if they used a lossy compression scheme, such as h.264 on top of their supposedly lossless video, they could use only 4.4% of the lossless bitrate, making the stream 266kbps. They could just 3759 feeds on a 1gbps line as long as Elrich was not using the line for ANY porn. So it's not even remotely possible with the most optimistic interpretation of what they're doing compression-wise -- which would truly be revolutionary, but there is no way that sort of compression would ever be possible without redefining what a bit is and rebuilding all computing infrastructure using some sort of quantum-computing system.  With p2p, however, each of the 3750 source feeds could be serving up an optimistic average of 15 mbps each -- 56 more streams from each machine getting you up to 210,000 users and if each of those users were averaging 15mbps, they could serve up 44 million feeds. p2p would make it pretty easy."

SiliconValleyHBO,3cw4t3,Pats420,3,Sat Jul 11 10:18:33 2015 UTC,"Well if the show is semi-realistic, then why do all the details have to be 100% true to life and not just entertaining?"

I appreciate what you're saying though, when a TV show needs you to suspend belief too often it loses it's sheen.  What pissed me off the most was the way they were not allowed to be successful with Intersite. I want to see what madness Erlich would create with $15Mn, just imagine what he'd have in his office!  So, yeah, I get where you're coming from, I sort of agree, but mainly I just wanted the guys to have a win somewhere in the show."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cw4t3,CanYouDigItHombre,2,Wed Jul 15 07:52:22 2015 UTC,Actually that happens all the time. The other day /r/programming linked an article about a guy who got hired by another company and his former was so pissed off they got him convicted of theft. He appealed it and got out like a year or two later (IDR) lost his wife maybe kids and his life was pretty ruined Coke disallows anyone who sells their product (except grocery stores) to sell pepsi. Ever notice you NEVER have the choice of either? IDK why you think this wouldn't happen. I heard rumors nintendo in the 80s didn't allow stores to sell unlicensed games otherwise they'll withdraw their store. The reasons were related to the video game crash Tiny money? In a lawsuit she doesn't know she can win. The delete key was so dumb and that scene would never happen. I can't think of a way to make video files lock up a system by deleting it. Probably.

SiliconValleyHBO,3cw4t3,sonofclemson,-7,Sat Jul 11 07:55:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a completely different scenario and I'd say you know nothing about the legal system. You seriously believe no-one is allowed to sell both Coke and Pepsi? And you seriously think it's plausible that no-one would host them? Again, you appear to be unfamiliar with the legal system.  And it is tiny money given the immense wealth which has repeatedly been mentioned. Glad you are not such an obsessive fanboy that you can't concede this one. The point is, you would never have an 'emergency meeting' where half the directors don't attend.  So yes, they should have shown a proper board meeting and explained howthis ridiculous outcome occurred. Again, you're missing the point."

It took me less than a minute to find this  Q: Why do so many restaurants only serve Pepsi or Coke but not both?  Answer:   If the restaurant is part of a regional or national chain, they usually sign an exclusivity contract with the beverage distributor to carry only that distributor's brand for a set period of time.  This is why you'll go to restaurants which formerly served Coke and find that they now serve Pepsi products. They changed their contract, usually because Pepsi offered them a lower prices for the syrup, the dispensers and the CO2.

SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,tinyweinr,21,Wed Jul 8 21:16:17 2015 UTC,TBBT is such a crappy show in comparison. Also overtime I see the show I don't understand how any of those supposedly smart people would make such bad jokes against themselves as such. Doesn't make any sense to me at all.
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,Skoden,5,Wed Jul 8 23:15:30 2015 UTC,"its really not that bad. Silicon Valley is better than most other comedies, But TBBT isn't that far off. It has a ton of re-watch-ability and the jokes are on point for a prime time syndicated show. Most people just hate it because of the politics behind the show, but who cares? Its not trying to make fun of ""nerds"" anymore than Silicon Valley is. Its also not making fun of Penny any more than its making fun of that random comic book guy with a lisp. Its a laid back show with a lot of good content."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,IHadaFishOnce,2,Wed Jul 8 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"Okay I agree that the anti-TBBT circlejerk goes overboard and it's as good or better than any other mediocre network sitcom. But it isn't nearly as good as SV. The laughtrack is obnoxious. The jokes are unoriginal and repetitive, and it often uses references in place of actual jokes."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,douglasmacarthur,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:22:39 2015 UTC,"But it isn't nearly as good as SV.   never said it is. Just said you shouldn't compare the two, and even if you do compare the two, SV isn't a beacon for ""nerd comedies"". Its more a beacon for ""good comedies"". But then you're comparing prime time writers to Mike Judge.    The jokes are unoriginal and repetitive   You would think that because TBBT was around for 9 seasons, and they don't look like they're stopping anytime soon. When it came out, it was revolutionary and a fun new comedy, now its outdated and beaten like a dead horse, but you can't blame TBBT, you can only just take it at face value and move on. When SV reaches their 10th season (as if it would), we'd also go ""enough already!"". And if you think that couldn't happen with a Mike Judge show, look no further than King of the Hill and Beavis and Butt Head (and I fucking loved the latter).    The laughtrack is obnoxious.   I wish people gave up on this. Okay, you don't like laugh-tracks, nice dude! What do you want me to say? ""sorry""? Laugh Tracks are common in the US and England. The IT Crowd is one of my all-time favorite shows, its about nerds, its smart comedy, and it has a laugh track. So what? Friends has a laugh track, Seinfeld has a laugh track, MASH has a laugh track, HIMYM has a laugh track, Lucky Louie has a laugh track. They're all great shows (bar: HIMYM's last few seasons), doesn't make them any worse.    it often uses references in place of actual jokes.   That's just characterization. You shouldn't expect quick-fire jokes every 5 seconds from any show. There's just as many references in SV, just a lot more dick jokes since HBO allows it."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,IHadaFishOnce,4,Thu Jul 9 14:43:26 2015 UTC,What? I am a huge nerd and the entire show is making fun of nerds and is no way shape or form an intelligent show. /u/pengu1nz makes a comment linking to another persons comments on TBBT that sum up exactly how I feel about TBBT.

SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,adityapstar,2,Thu Jul 9 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"I think HIMYM is also a terrible show, and I watched Seinfeld before becoming aware of the laugh track, I cant watch it today.

I still stand by the point that laugh tracks are one of the worst things in TV."

SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,ashishduh1,4,Wed Jul 8 23:53:02 2015 UTC,"yeah I read that guy's comment and I found it baseless and unfair.   Sheldon isn't any more neurotic and pretentious than Gilfoyle, Leonard isn't any more anxious and in-over-his-head than Richard, Howard and Raj are great characters in an otherwise eccentric ensemble comedy, while Penny is not by any means the one character we're supposed to sympathize with, she's more a foil to Leonard, who brings him back down to earth and makes him the one we relate to. Leonard serves as a bridge between the viewer and the wacky pretentious underbelly of the Science world. If Penny seems overly dumbed down, its because its the only way to efficiently bring down Leonard, which also causes tension in the group and brings everyone else down to earth. Saying the show sucks because we're only supposed to relate with Penny, is kind of ignorant and baseless.   Also,    Also laugh track is fucking horrible. Being told when to laugh is the worst possible thing in my opinion.    Some of the best shows of our time have laugh tracks. You're entitled to your opinion, but it doesn't make TBBT any worse in particular."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,IHadaFishOnce,8,Wed Jul 8 23:37:22 2015 UTC,Some of the best shows of our time have laugh tracks.   Like Black Books.

SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,dontknowmeatall,36,Thu Jul 9 03:46:39 2015 UTC,I love how much internet nerds hate Big Bang theory
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,apathetictransient2,2,Wed Jul 8 22:53:36 2015 UTC,There was a good bestof post that has some good explanation about why people hate TBBT on Reddit.  https://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/16294p/one_of_the_the_best_magnitude_scenes/c7s2iwg
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,pengu1nz,18,Wed Jul 8 23:13:13 2015 UTC,But like....it's a TV show. People spend so much of their time hating a TV show.
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,MasterLawlz,10,Wed Jul 8 23:15:52 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you, I don't understand why you're being downvoted. I personally dislike pretty much all reality/talent television, but pay no mind to it. If my opinion is asked, I'll share it. People do spend a lot of time hating things when time could be better spent."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,Ruddose,3,Thu Jul 9 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever once heard an actual fan of keeping up with the kardashians or jersey shore talk about it. The only time I ever hear them mentioned is when people say ""All people care about is Snooki or the Kardashians hurr durr"". And I don't think I've heard a twilight fan since I was in middle school and yet people still complain about it. Neckbeards get so angry at the fact that little girls enjoy sparking vampires or Justin Bieber even though a sizable portion of them enjoy my little pony, and honestly I don't see how any of those things are worse than Pokemon or Yugioh or all the other asinine stuff we liked when we were little kids (I liked those shows when I was really young but let's face it, they were mediocre toy commercials).   I used to like TBBT but the internet kinda ruined it for me. It was a pretty harmless TV show but people get so insanely up in arms that a comedy exaggerated stereotypical nerds for the sake of laughs, even though comedies have been doing that with various groups since before TV was invented.   Sorry for the rant but I feel like I can't go on the Internet with one of this circlejerks showing up."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,MasterLawlz,2,Thu Jul 9 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"Even more, most of the haters haven't even watched the show. They just read some rant about how Sheldon is arrogant (like literally all the main characters that were popular in 2007), or Penny is the audience token (which feels actually more patronising to the audience than to Penny). Or they just go HUR DUR LAUGH TRACK SUCKS even though some of the greatest sitcoms of our time use it (Friends, HIMYM, Seinfeld). I get that some people might not like the humour used; that's fine. It's not suited for everyone, just as SV's humour isn't suited for everyone. What I don't get is how they treat it like blackface (I've even heard them actually call it ""nerd blackface""), like it's hurting anyone when in fact it's one of the main reasons nerd culture became mainstream in the last decade (just behind Ironman in terms of popularity amongst the non-nerds). It's a different show with a different target audience, and that's fine. There's no need to demonise it like it fucked your mother."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,dontknowmeatall,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:55:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's reddit. I don't personally care for TBBT but was just providing context as to why the circlejerk exists."

SiliconValleyHBO,3cl0am,imsrslyyouguys,13,Wed Jul 8 20:57:57 2015 UTC,"Because it's become a circlejerk at this point, and it's the same exact painting in both shows, so his comment is pretty shitty."

SiliconValleyHBO,3cipp0,freliant,18,Wed Jul 8 18:13:38 2015 UTC,Electric cars have the potential to be extreme performance machines they don't have to fuss with gears and make shit loads of torque from 0 rpm. It's really not even fair to compare an EV with an IC engine. I am however impressed with it's stability given the narrow width but the price is astronomical and a tesla model s is better in most ways outside of the compact footprint which I guess is only cool for parking
SiliconValleyHBO,3cipp0,jjhats,3,Wed Jul 8 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"The entire concept of the car was when the inventor looked around and saw all the wasted space while stuck in traffic on a freeway.   Parking is one thing, but you can legally lane split in these cars, and you'd be able to compact down traffic in half if everyone had one or something similar."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cipp0,cakedestroyer,3,Wed Jul 8 22:04:43 2015 UTC,That's an insanely ambitious goal and sounds way more dangerous than it's worth. Short of them moving everyone to skinny cars and actually re labeling the roads to be skinny it would never cut down on traffic
SiliconValleyHBO,3cipp0,jjhats,2,Wed Jul 8 22:08:45 2015 UTC,"I understand not everyone can or wants to ride a motorcycle, but...did the inventor think about motorcycles? Cuz how many people can you fit in one of these cars?"

SiliconValleyHBO,3cipp0,abfguisf,11,Wed Jul 8 10:46:22 2015 UTC,"Likely steel construction of the roll cage and batteries.   Motors and battery box alone weigh 1,800 lbs. The battery box is made of 10-guage 304 stainless steel. The FIA-certified roll cage that is the chassis is made of 4130 chrome-moly steel DOM tubing.

SiliconValleyHBO,3cighg,Mr_Popper,7,Wed Jul 8 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"Entourage and Eastbound and Down had happy endings. And the season 2 ending wasn't really an unhappy ending. I mean yeah he got removed as CEO but he wasn't really qualified or good at the job to begin with. The ones that are proficient in coding aren't very good at business and the ones that are good at business (Erlich and OJ) aren't very good with computers or technology.

SiliconValleyHBO,3cb6gi,SecondsParadise,8,Mon Jul 6 21:07:25 2015 UTC,"It's not that the cat is literally living and dead simultaneously, its a ""quantum state"". Essentially: I don't know if its alive or dead, but there's an equal chance of both, so I can assume that either is true (until I have further proof). In that sense, I can imagine a version of this world where the cat is dead, and I can imagine a version of this world where the cat is alive. I have no evidence proving or disproving either version of the world, so for the moment both are valid models.  That's my understanding anyway.  What helped me grasp the concept was the idea of Deterministic/non-deterministic finite state autamata (my CS degree requires an autamata theory course).   For a DFA an action (a) when used in some state (1) will always take me to a particular state (2), but if I perform action a in state 1 of a NFA, I could end up in state 1 or state 2. To simplify the system for the NFA, we simply say action a in state 1 takes us to the singular state ""1,2"". ""1,2"" is a quantum state that says I could be in either state 1 or state 2, but I don't know which until something else happens.  Now assume there is a second action (b) which goes from 1 to 3 and 2 to 4. So our NFA has state 1 which goes to (1,2) via a, and 3 via b, then state (1,2) which also goes to (1,2) via a, but goes to (3,4) via b."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cb6gi,TransPM,3,Tue Jul 7 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"You're more-or-less correct.  The finite state analogy doesn't quite work, but it's really close.  The heart of the cat paradox is the notion of quantum superposition.  This is basically what you called a quantum state, i.e. (1,2).  What's important, though, is that the system isn't in either 1 or 2 until something happens but that it really and truly is simultaneously in both 1 and 2 at the exact same time.  Each state has not only a probability associated with it, but also a phase.  (1,2) can be coherently manipulated after the fact -- some of state 1 moved to state 2 or vice versa.  It's only through observation that the state collapses from a superposition like (1,2) to a ""pure state"" like 1 or 2.  The most accurate formulation of the cat paradox ties the poisoning of the cat to a quantum phenomenon.  Something like:   A radioactive atomic sample is placed under a Geiger counter in a box.  If the Geiger counter detects the decay of the sample, it will break a vial of toxic gas and kill a cat also present in the box.    The nucleus of the radioactive sample exists in a superposition state between decay and non-decay, and according to the paradox that superposition entangles itself with the state of the Geiger counter, the gas vial and ultimately the life of the cat.  Until someone ""observes"" the state of any of those things, all of them are simultaneously in both states.   The obvious flaw in the paradox, and where the whole thing breaks down, is that the Geiger counter, the breaking of the vial and the cat's own ability to determine whether it is alive or dead each constitute observation.  Those things never become entangled with the state of the atom because they are each macroscopic, non-quantum (""classical"") observers.  Quantum superposition states are real things that can be quantified and manipulated.  But this is only possible by isolating the states from external observation, and Schrodinger's paradox doesn't allow for that.  Ok, that was a really long winded way of saying I liked your post."

SiliconValleyHBO,3cb6gi,TransPM,2,Wed Jul 8 03:55:36 2015 UTC,Yeah!
SiliconValleyHBO,3cb6gi,rhythmjones,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:10:14 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. One of my math instructors when I was in high school explained it to me this way:  Imagine you're in a dark room with a bunch of tennis balls. These tennis balls represent electrons or any atomic particle used for scanning/measurement. There is a coke can sitting somewhere in the room. To look for it you start throwing tennis balls. Once you hear it hit, you know where the coke can was, but since it was hit by the tennis ball the can is no longer in the same position and now has some velocity. This was a pretty good explanation for the heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which  I think was the focus of the cat in a box experiment. I may be wrong since I didn't end up studying physics (mech. eng. instead) but was a very cool subject taught in college (we all had to take basic quantum as undergrads)."
SiliconValleyHBO,3cb6gi,cheecheepong,3,Wed Jul 8 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, not really related to the Schrodinger thought experiment.   Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that we can never know both the exact speed and exact position of a particle (I believe it's a particle, I forget if its a specific kind of particle though). This is because the very act of measuring or observing a particle will alter one of those values (just like finding the can by launching it to another location in the room).  I've been thinking about my explanation lately though and realized that without a visual representation of a DFA/NFA, it might be a little hard to understand, but I think I have an example that can help clear that up.  Quantum states (what Schroedinger's cat is all about), are a bit like Aces in the game of blackjack. In case you don't know, when playing black jack, an ace can count as 1 or 11 (your goal is to get cards that add up to 21 without going over). So say your starting cards are an ace and a 6. This essentially puts you in state (7,17). You decide to press your luck by drawing another card and you get a 3, so now you're in state (10,20). Now let's just assume your the world' ballsiest blackjack player and you take another hit, now drawing an 8. You can no longer count the ace as 11, because that would make you bust (go over 21), so now you are in the non-quantum state (18).  Schroedinger's cat is essentially the Ace. The Ace can be 1 or 11 so long as your hand adds up to under 21 either way, and the cat could be either alive or dead (so far as you k ow) so long as you can't see inside the box. Of course the cat can't actually be both simultaneously, but neither can the Ace. For blackjack, you actually choose the value of your Ace (you just always choose the highest possible), it can't be both 1 and 11 simultaneously because you can't have 2 hands. But when you go over 21, you know that the Ace must be 1, just like when you open the box, you know that the cast must be either dead or alive (whichever you observe)"

SiliconValleyHBO,3cb6gi,cheecheepong,5,Wed Jul 8 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"i don't think either got it ""wrong"" per-say.. they both explained schrodingers thought experiment correctly. His thought experiment may have been a critique of the copenhagen interpretation, but it's still an example of the scenario needed. Sure, it'd be better to say that it's Copenhagen's belief that upon observation the superposition collapses and the cat can be determined alive or dead, however the schrodinger's cat thought experiment still provides a real world explanation of superpositions in a logical way. The only way I could see it being wrong is if they explicitly state that Schrodinger believed in this model and believed that the cat existed in a superposition as both alive and dead, whereas they only make mention that he provided a scenario for it"
SiliconValleyHBO,3cb6gi,noneabove1182,9,Mon Jul 6 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"They missed out the part where it's an specifically an atom decaying that trips a poison mechanism and kills the cat (Copenhagen Interpretation says the atom exists in both states at the same time, therefore it simultaneously kills the cat and it doesn't.)

Also it brings along the unfortunate side effect of large audiences now assuming and claiming they know what ""geek culture"" is all about based on watching that show.

Or choosing not to vote at all on opinions you don't agree with.  It's an inevitable thing is it not? To upvote something you agree with, meaning the things that will have the highest upvotes will usually be the things that most redditors agree with it  PS: I know upvotes are not meant for agreements or disagreements, but everyone knows that's not the case."

Everyone could love it (for some odd reason) and my opinion (and post) would have been the same.   Reddit's thinking about the matter has nothing whatsoever to do with my thoughts about it being crap. That's because it can be crap all by itself, in a vacuum shared by me and the show alone.

I know that technically, she is under employment from Raviga and has to vote the same has the other 2 board members from Raviga. People have said that if she were to vote against them, she sould simply lose her seat and get fired. However, when Raviga made the offer to back PP, they settled for 10M for 20% of Pied Piper, and also that Monica gets to sit for Raviga. Now I don't know if there was a legal document signed stating that Monica HAD to be the one to be seating for Raviga, but if there was, then I think she could technically side with Richard and Erlich and give the control of the company back to the boys of PP."

SiliconValleyHBO,3c7jv2,dafragsta,16,Mon Jul 6 01:21:56 2015 UTC,Erlich PROVED ON THE FUCKING SHOW he is not a leader. Remember that embarrassing ordeal for Erlich in the hearing where the Pied Piper lawyer laid it all out why Erlich is a shit leader? Erlich is all talk. He's no more capable of leading Pied Piper than Richard. He would've fucked it up. Erlich is hanger-on trying to take all the credit.

Erlich was also the one who originally articulated what Pied Piper actually did/was capable of way back in Season 1 during the pitch to Peter Gregory, when Richard was pulling his hair out because he didn't know what his own company did.  He seems to have a lot more vision than Richard, as well as the better social skills."
SiliconValleyHBO,3c7jv2,haokun32,8,Sun Jul 5 22:17:38 2015 UTC,Just because he doesn't have the same flaws as Richard doesn't mean he'd be a good CEO. The show has shown repeatedly that he's not a good leader.

SiliconValleyHBO,3by5x7,sanbazhang,3,Fri Jul 3 07:02:12 2015 UTC,Celebrity status can be a big thing as I understand it. Manny Pacquiao as pointed out by Jared in this episode is a legislator. Why? He's just a boxer. Being a celebrity is enough to elevate someone into the ranks of the government. If Justin Bieber (one example) lived in the Philippines he not only would have his last name pronounced incorrectly but probably elected as the president.  As for how celebrity status relates to a viral video is beyond me. I never understood that scene from The Office.

Erlich has his 10% of shares along with Gilfoyle and Dinesh at somewhere around 3-5% each. Jared must have some shares (assuming 2-3%), and Richard should still have the majority, right? Adding up, they would still hold majority of Pied Piper's share, even though they gave those seats away to Hanneman and Raviga. During the series A negotiation, Richard did negotiate a 20% deal with Raviga and in season one had a 5% deal with Peter Gregory, so at most, they have the other 1/4 of Pied Piper's shares."

The board seats decide/vote on what to do with allocated funds for the company. Like what the algorithm should be used for, and what direction they take the company in etc. etc. Richard still has the majority shares, but he doesn't have the majority vote when it comes to what he (as the CEO, or ex-ceo) wants to do with his algorithm/company."

SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,Glory2Hypnotoad,42,Tue Jun 30 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, people treat it like a ""feminism grade"" when it makes no claim be that. A movie can have interesting and balanced female characters without passing the test, and vice versa."
SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,TheMeatball,17,Wed Jul 1 01:16:07 2015 UTC,"Entertainment Weekly recently did an article on the Bechdel test, and interviewed Bechdel herself.  She said the test isn't by any means meant to be full proof for testing for diversity or sexism in a movie.  There are a lot of movies that pass the test that could easily be considered sexist, and there are movies that fail that are amazing movies that would be worsened if you forced a passing element.  It's just an interesting guideline to show the overall lack of diversity in movies/TV."

It's only main female character in s1 - Monica - was always portrayed as intelligent, hardworking and an extremely savvy businessperson. That seems pretty positive to me, and not at all sexist.  SV would not be the brilliant show it is if it had to check every diversity and gender equality box every episode. The women in the show have been introduced organically and fit the story very well. Long may that continue, and not having to satisfy every equality or diversity 'critic' that complains about a comedy portraying it's titular location for what it actually is - mostly white, mostly male, mostly nerdy and completely hilarious."
SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,FelinaACNL,14,Tue Jun 30 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"Compared to other tech industry portrayals, I think they are doing an admirable job of at least trying to address some of the gender issues and sexism.  I was cracking up at the thing about assuming the two females had so much in common.  And, the female programmer (forgot her name) screwing with the guys and just a bunch of stuff around her, like her interview, was very clever.  I want to say, ""A"" for effort, but a little lower on execution.   I don't see how portraying a male dominated industry as being male dominated is sexist and not accurate.   As for this, it depends how it is done.  For example, I found The Social Network (the movie) offensive, misogynist, as did a lot of people.  Sorkin claims he was just showing the real sexism by, for example, making Zuckerberg have issues with women and having the men going to strip clubs and that kind of cliched thing.  BS.  There is another way of showing sexism that lets the viewer know that the writers/directors are also critical of it, or at least challenging it.  Mad Men did this very well, and I think SV is certainly making a really good effort.  Also, btw, the computer as ""girlfriend"" running joke was also hilarious."

True what you have said and pointed out.

She and Monica, the only female from Season One, discuss the future of Pied Piper, the legacy of Peter, and various other business matters throughout Season Two.   During the scene you mentioned, Laurie awkwardly says ""Peter Gregory is dead"" every few sentences. I initially thought that this was intended to make her appear (even more) socially awkward, but after reading your thoughts I am convinced that this was a way for the writers to poke even more fun at the Bechdel test. By making every aspect of their conversation tie back to Peter's death, ultimately the conversation as a whole is ""about a man"". Therefore, the series technically may still not pass the Bechdel test."

Take Shawshank redemption, it fails the test miserably, but because its a film about men and male relationships, and as such doesn't talk much about women, I don't think that is inherently sexist. Then take the fast and furious series, full of women who are all one sided caricatures, and eye candy. A rather misogynistic series I'd say, but it passes, several times.

SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,suss2it,14,Wed Jul 1 02:16:21 2015 UTC,The Bechdel test isn't some formal test that criticizes any singular piece of work. It's an indictment on film as a whole that most movies don't end up passing. Sure some don't and there's good reasons for that like the one you stated for Shawshank but when a vast majority of the movies can't pass such a simple test there's a problem.
SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,klug3,4,Tue Jun 30 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, applying it willy-nilly doesn't make much sense. But for movies that deal with supposedly ""normal""/""average"" people it does.

SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,cyberpunking,3,Tue Jun 30 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"my point though is that it is designed poorly, since several movies e.g. fast and furious, can pass easily while being entirely misogynistic, while many movies will fail it simply by having subject matter that excuses the absence of women.   I don't mean to say that a test like this has no place, and I would hope that any script I ever happened to write would pass this simple test, however i've seen far too many soccer moms and armchair feminists on facebook talking about this test as if it is the definitive word on whether or not a movie deserves to be watched."

I don't even know why anyone would criticize a show that is a comedy and satire. I don't think passing the test will make the world a better place and I think there's other root issues people might want to care about instead of complaining about superficial things.  And hey, maybe it was a coincidence. Does it actually matter? It doesn't because we shouldn't care."

SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,r6662,-4,Sat Jul 4 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"First time I hear of this Bechdel test, sounds like total bull. Who are you to decide what the plot of a film is about? Using a 3 question test to tag something as sexist because it didn't contain the characters/character relations you wanted... Everytime somebody external to the production of a film says what should appear in a film I get an ugly feeling of disappointment in humanity."
SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,klug3,3,Sun Jul 5 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"Anyways thanks for clarifying that this is for industries and not for individual pieces, I just realized the majority of people in this thread have a misconception about the Bechdel test (and of course so did I initially)."
SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,r6662,2,Tue Jun 30 22:24:04 2015 UTC,"OP's article says that SV failed the test as if it were something wrong, but she/he claims that SV is an exception to failing the test, and nobody seems to tell OP that Bechdel is supposed to be applied on industries not individual series. Needless to say that if the test has exceptions then it's an unreliable test and nobody should be taking it seriously, hence my initial reaction.  I do agree that Hollywood produced mostly shitty and simplistic films, it's just what our society prefers and money destroying artistic quality has always been an issue, and not just with sexism."
SiliconValleyHBO,3bo7i8,r6662,3,Wed Jul 1 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"Its only really relevant for ""normal"" movies or TV Shows. For something that focuses on a hyper-specific section of society like SV, I don't think the test makes much sense."

SiliconValleyHBO,3bc2sh,caepha,9,Sat Jun 27 21:07:03 2015 UTC,I heard they actually made it a real thing after the show starting airing since there was no standard way to measure compression which is the same reason they made it up for the show

SiliconValleyHBO,3bc2sh,jordangerdes,2,Sun Jun 28 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Shows of this ilk, namely mainstream(ish) productions aimed at my demographic (techy/programmer/nerd/whatever), almost always make me bristle. This is because their basis of relatability is almost always just namedropping. The Big Bang Theory is egregious as fuck about this. It's designed such that the audience hears a reference to Schrodinger's Cat or Fermi's Interaction, and they are supposed to go ""Oh I've heard of that! I must be smart like these characters!"" and like the show for making them feel smart. And Silicon Valley isn't completely innocent of this crime either (""I taught myself Ruby on Rails over a weekend when I was 17"", and also a mention of Schrodinger's Cat) but they also do something different that actually does work: things like this.  The mean jerk time conversation is a brilliant example of how programmers/engineers' brains work, combined with funny absurd subject matter. Normal people would stop that conversation one or two sentences in, and go ""why the fuck are we talking about jerking off 800 people?"" but programmers see a problem, and in particular, a problem that is expanding in complexity, and their focus is solving it, not thinking about whether the problem needs to be solved, or whether the problem even really exists. That is the kind of moment I appreciate in this show, because it relates to how my brain works, not which arbitrary checklist of tech concepts I know.  edit: I just remembered a couple plot points that drive me nuts with their inaccuracy: 1) The whole ""carver"" episode seems to rely on Pied Piper not using source control. If they are doing their jobs well, they lose a day's work at most. I understand things may be slack at a startup, and check ins may be less frequent than they should be, but still. You won't lose your entire system in the time it takes to buy oreos. 2) The largest porn company in the world would have redundancy upon redundancy for their content, not to mention the fact that Pied Piper would have read-only access to it. And I kind of doubt they'd transfer terabytes over FTP. And holding down a delete key during an FTP session doesn't delete things on the server. So much wrong with that situation."

They also claim that ""middle-out"" is lossless compression, while using terms that reference lossy compression.  I'm also friends with the guy that invented AAC (the codec iTunes uses) and his trials and tribulations are much like Richards.  Though he is retired now!  Re: startup culture and I think they nailed that pretty well.  I interviewed at the SV startup Palantir last year and it was very much like a Hooli environment.

SiliconValleyHBO,3bc2sh,K3wp,2,Sun Jun 28 13:47:43 2015 UTC,"They claim the PP compression mechanism is loss-less.  Among other things, the Shannon paper introduces the concept of entropy in the context of information theory.  This is how much information is contained in any single message.  The compression ratios they discuss for a lossless compressor are simply impossible.  It's like claiming you can transmit two bits of entropy with a single bit.  Can't happen."

It was a big budget, class-act movie starring Russell Crowe, directed by Ron Howard, etc.  Yet, somehow, it couldn't be bothered to correctly explain probably Nash's most important/influential idea -- the Nash Equilibrium.  Instead, the movie explained it incorrectly with some game theory, strategy game of picking up girls at a bar.  Would it have really been too hard to come up with a compelling example that illustrates the theory correctly?  Especially, in a big-budget film honoring the life of John Nash.  Ugghh...  I feel more forgiving towards a tv series in principal because they work on much shorter timelines, but HBO is known to be generous.  Edit:  Ok, I'm a teensy bit (a very teensy bit) embarrassed to have just realized that I have read that Shannon paper and didn't at all make the connection.

SiliconValleyHBO,3bc2sh,AggressivePlayer7414,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:49:21 2015 UTC,They nailed it. They compress series of events that sometimes you wonder if it could really happen but yes it does just not that quickly  Except the tequila bottle delete screen. That's the only thing that definitely wouldn't happen. They skim on details so much that I didn't realize they were trans coding and uploading the video until after the scene when I had a breather to take in the transcoding screen (I paused to ready the screen) and delete event.  Minor mistakes here and there. Like deleting large files don't lock up your system but deleting many files can slow it down a hella lot but as they were videos it shouldnt and what richard said at the end implied large files lock it up just as much which is incorrect (that ep was bad tho)

Why limit a type of post if the system in place already functions based off what the community thinks is interesting or not?  This doesn't effect my life negatively or at all, just seems like an arbitrary place to draw the line and am curious."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b9xcm,virtualliteralhitler,14,Sat Jun 27 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"It's not really arbitrary. The mods want to keep discussion in this subreddit relevant to Silicon Valley. We don't need to be reminded every day that these actors are able to find work in other TV shows and movies. They're talented actors, of course they are going to be in other things. I (and obviously the majority of people here) come to this subreddit to discuss the show, therefore it makes sense that 2 seasons into the show, the ""HEY! LOOK WHO IT IS ON A SHOW THAT ISN'T SILICON VALLEY"" posts have grown a little bit annoying"
SiliconValleyHBO,3b9xcm,jonlubbe,3,Sat Jun 27 12:13:38 2015 UTC,"Right, but if they're annoying can't they just be downvoted or not upvoted and it won't be dealt with?  I think it is arbitrary, but if you prefer we can probably agree to restate it as; there isn't a bright line being drawn between content only related to the show, and other ancillary content.   Right now the top page of the subreddit is:   caricature drawing of a character award acceptance speech actor reviewing apps in youtube video Question about character social post by actor re: SCOTUS ruling Picture of a wall socket with pied piper on it Article about on the set, off camera Q about show random IG picture of character and someone not show related post about link between show producers name and office space character (pretty much what is being banned here, but because it's not a picture of an actor in another movie it's ok)   You get the gist. I don't really submit links in this sub and I don't find those types of posts interesting myself, but was curious about why single this type of post out when there's already a system in place to deal with content the community at large doesn't like..downvoting and thus not showing up in the stream.  I understand the complaint though, mainly curious."

SiliconValleyHBO,3baj6c,donvito716,5,Sat Jun 27 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"im pretty sure it had something to do with gavin belson cuz there was a picture of peter and gavin and they looked like they were in college and friends.  They were probably going to expand on that in season 2, but christopher evan welch, the actor for peter gregory, died and so they couldn't develop that idea.  If he didn't die, they probably would've talked about how gavin and peter had a fight in college or some shit and that forced gregory to drop out or something.  And maybe the reason he hates college is cuz belson did graduate and he didn't so he wants to be better than him by saying college sucks anyways lol..."
SiliconValleyHBO,3baj6c,1TRUEKING,3,Sat Jun 27 15:09:26 2015 UTC,In short he doesn't believe it teaches you the skills useful to programmers. Theory isn't practically. Doing code drills/a few problems doesn't teach problem solving.
SiliconValleyHBO,3baj6c,AggressivePlayer7414,0,Sat Jun 27 19:20:49 2015 UTC,Because Peter is smart and knows college is useless for the entreprenurial minds in Silicon Valley and if anything will dull their innovation.

SiliconValleyHBO,3baj6c,colin_7,4,Sun Jun 28 08:23:39 2015 UTC,Probably investments... Remember his burger king cicada rant? Maybe he and Gavin used to be friends but aren't anymore because Peter helped start Hooli but Gavin honeydicked him out of it... and with the money from that Peter invested in other companies and made a fortune.
SiliconValleyHBO,3baj6c,elijahharry,3,Sun Jun 28 02:13:46 2015 UTC,That really makes sense. Considering that Peter hated Gavin. Gavin probably talked him into cashing out of Hooli before it got huge.
SiliconValleyHBO,3baj6c,colin_7,2,Sun Jun 28 04:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this theory makes perfect sense. Remember when Peter called Richard in Season 1 right when Richard got offered 10 mil from Gavin? Peter offered 200,000 for 5% or something, he wanted to snipe the deal out from under Gavin and let Richard keep control probably because Gavin bought Hooli out from Peter."
SiliconValleyHBO,3baj6c,elijahharry,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:28:33 2015 UTC,S2E1 during the funeral Gavin mentions that Peter and he made VGA graphics cards together in their garage. I wonder how much that helped them become wealthy.

The show is funny, I laugh a lot watching, but it's soooooo predictable. I don't know why people say it's stressful when you can see something bad coming from a mile away.   I have the same problem with Veep (which I think is a much better show than Silicon Valley). Veep is hilarious, but I know nothing good is ever going to happen. I think the reason I don't mind as much on Veep is because the characters are terrible people and it's fun to watch them struggle. I like the characters on Silicon Valley.

Definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet.  It's an alternate reality show where the Axis powers won ww2 and Germany/Japan took over and split up America much like Germany was split east/west.  Highly recommend."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3i5m,CountPanda,6,Thu Jun 25 22:07:35 2015 UTC,That's because there isn't a full season.  Amazon dumps a bunch of pilots and tries to gauge which ones are the popular ones.  The ones with the most demand would get picked up for the season.  You should read the book.  It's a trip.  By Philip K Dick.

SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,IDontBelieveInIsms,10,Thu Jun 25 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing this out it was missed a lot.  However to point out one thing, Richard does not own 85%   in the episode where Dinesh and Gilfoyle are working with Carla (she's pretending she makes a lot more money) they both mention that they have 3 points each, so assuming Jared has 3 points himself ( the likely scenario) the break down is actually as follows:  Richard 76.0% Elrich:   10.0% Raviga:  5.0% Dinesh:  3.0% Gilfoyle: 3.0% Jared:    3.0%    Edit** Pointed out earlier that they actually have 3% and not 3.5%.  I've seen this question asked a few times. Thought I would add in and help, this isn't confirmed but what I think is probable since Dinesh and Gilfoyle both said they have 3 I'd think Jared would have the same."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,Rokk184892,3,Thu Jun 25 21:55:55 2015 UTC,"I just checked 2.04 and Dinesh says he and Gilfoyle have 3 points - so 3 for them, same to Jared, 76% for Richard."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,altogether-andrews,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:00:06 2015 UTC,You are correct! Not sure where I was getting .5%
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,Rokk184892,2,Thu Jun 25 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"Raviga had 5.0% from Peter Gregory's initial investment, but then they bought Russ's stake in the company. I don't recall how much he bought in for."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,ReelBIgFisk,12,Thu Jun 25 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"He didn't buy equity in the company.   It was a loan, so he really has no percent of the company. They really bought him out for the two board seats he had as agreement for this loan.  I think they talked about it when Richard was showing them the check after meeting with him Jared said something about it being just a loan.  Edit Grammar is hard."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,Rokk184892,12,Thu Jun 25 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"There's only one small thing I'd add. One of Richard's stipulations when he signed with Raviga was that Monica votes for their Board Seat. So her boss would have had to call her in. She still could have disagreed but then, as you said, she may lose her job. (and forfeit her vote anyways)  I actually found the lines. When Richard is in negotiations with the new CEO of Raviga he argues their investment down and says:  (Richard) - Take it or leave it.  (Laurie Bream) - I was not anticipating this, but I think it will be workable from our end.  (Richard) - And one more thing Monica votes for Raviga's board seat.  (Laurie Bream) - Certainly that seems unimportant.  It's just one of the reasons why this show is so much fun to rewatch. The writing really is incredible. Dat foreshadowing!"
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,thecastingforecast,11,Thu Jun 25 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"That was a condition of their term sheet if they funded their series A, which they backed out on. So no agreement took place, so it's still very possible they did the vote without Monica being there."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,Rokk184892,3,Thu Jun 25 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Richard could nullify his removal if Monica voting the Raviga seat is part of the funding agreement (if such a thing is legal; contract law is easily trumped).  It also depends on what the quorum requirement for a PP board meeting is.  Laurie's coup is valid at 60%, but not 2/3.  Either is fairly common.  It was also stupid of Richard (and Ron LaFlamme) to not put some stipulations on the transfer of board seats, especially the ones Russ controlled.  I don't know if board seats are transferable in this situation, but in my experience they are not.  There are many potential ways that Richard could remain CEO, and several ways he could regain control."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,Caraes_Naur,2,Thu Jun 25 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"It makes it more interesting, plot-relationship wise if Monica did vote him out. It sets up many plots as he tries to regain control.   It's a shame Carla left (they said all the engineers left when they couldn't pay them) as I don't think they explored all the possibilities of having a technologically strong female to break the boys club and screw with their minds more."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,Xuttuh,3,Fri Jun 26 09:42:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think Carla is gone. If you check the Pied Piper Site you still see her on the team. Since Richard has been removed from the team it's clearly been updated since the last episode.   I'd assume if she were really gone, she would be off the site too. Expect her back in Season 3."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,jeh31,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"I thought that that a stipulation with the additional investment. Since that investment didn't go through due to the lawsuit, that stipulation shouldn't be legally binding."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,matafubar,2,Thu Jun 25 21:09:45 2015 UTC,"Question (I really don't understand), how the hell can you own 85% of a company but not have any power to direct it's day to day activity. Or even be fired? Like if I own 70% of a company and the other 30% is owned by two other people and we all sit on a board together does it really matter what they vote? Since my vote is worth 70% and there's combined is only 30%?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,maluman,2,Fri Jun 26 05:52:52 2015 UTC,From what I hear shareholders do have some power (aka Richard) but IDK what they are. The show compresses events so instead of spreading it in a bunch of episodes they just made it the last 2minutes. Hell laurie could have said Russ needs to remove richard from CEO before she'll buy him out. Of course Russ would do it to get into the 3 comma club and like most of this sub agrees richard would be happier not being CEO. The way they presented it just made it more simple
SiliconValleyHBO,3b3zys,AggressivePlayer7414,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:38:48 2015 UTC,"It depends on if the bird is structured to vote by percentage or a strict one vote per seat policy. Clearly we have seen that PP's board votes based on a pure one vote policy as evidenced by when Monica, Richard and Urlich all voted together to out vote Russ and his girlfriend."

I bought one because it was cheap and gave it away.   They have a really wimpy stand, it wobbled all over the place even after i shimmed the bracket holding it together. It also uses a proprietary mount instead of VESA, so you have to buy a 20 dollar 3rd party adapter to use it with a real stand. (and I wouldn't trust turning it 90 degrees w/ one of those)   The picture was decent though. If you could get over the wobbling it was an alright monitor. I just type hard. Tbh if they're like ~120 you probably couldn't do better for the price if you had no plans on buying a multi-monitor stand."

SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,squat251,7,Thu Jun 25 06:55:17 2015 UTC,"Monica is not a board member. Monica has voted before as a board member as a representative for Raviga. This means that when Raviga called an emergency to vote Richard out they would not have necessarily had Monica in on the vote. Raviga controls 3 of the 5 board seats and could have any members of their connected team sit as the board members.   So if Raviga was voting Richard out, they would have been smart to remove Monica from one of these positions as she could be perceived to be too close to the members particularly Richard. From there Raviga would have been wise to choose 3 people to vote who would fall in line the Raviga vote out of Richard.   This means that either three people senior to Monica sat and voted to remove Richard. Or Monica was forced under pressure of losing her job to vote Richard out. Either way Monica did not have a choice and either option sets up the story line in an interesting way. 1) Monica didn't have a choice not to or lose her job. Sorry Richard. 2) Monica didn't sit as one of Raviga's three seats and didn't have a say or spoke up and was shot down. Sorry Richard.   Also emergency meetings can be called by boards as long as a quorum, simple majority, is present. This means the three Raviga seats can call a board meeting without Richard or Urlich present."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,IDontBelieveInIsms,2,Thu Jun 25 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"Richard did stipulate that Monica has to vote for Raviga when they had one seat on the board. That's why her boss called her in when they bought Russ' two votes. She had to be there to agree so they had a majority. I don't think she wanted to go against Richard, but when your boss says, ""This is what we're doing."" You go along with it unless you want to look for a new job. (In which case she might have forfeited her vote anyways as she would no longer be with the company.)"
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,thecastingforecast,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Monica voting for Raviga was for the extra finance deal that Raviga backed out on, which caused the involvement of Russ."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,cjsr4c90,4,Mon Jun 29 01:05:12 2015 UTC,"It probably doesn't matter - even if it was deleted it was still technically part of the process in coming up with the algorithm.   My understanding was that Raviga had one vote and that was being represented by Monica. Now Raviga has purchased two more votes so now they have three, and there's no need for Monica's representation anymore."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,oldscotch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:17:51 2015 UTC,Check my response. Goes into an explanation of Monica's position in relation to the board seat.

SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,oldscotch,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"Under penalty of perjury, you state to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God. Hooli is trying to say that the whole idea of Pied Piper is something that Hooli was already testing and Richard took the idea and tried to pass it off as his. In essence; he stole the idea is what Hooli is trying to make it seem like. He then used his paid time to create an application he stole from the company he works for. Think of it as the movie The Social Network. Jessie Eisenberg, ""Mark Zuckerburg"", was hired to create the equivalent of Facebook for another set of individuals. He was being paid to create something for someone else. Instead; he took their entire idea and decided to make his own spinoff of it.   Urlic has 1 vote, Richard has 1 vote, Monica has 1 vote, and Raviga has 2 votes. With the majority leaning towards Raviga as Monica is an employee, even if an emergency board meeting is called and Urlic and Richard had been present, the situation would have been the same.  While Monica could have very well sided against Raviga, based on the context of the conversation prior to the phone call, you can tell she didn't want to have to vote against Richard and Urlic. They ended without showing the actual conversation of the board meeting, however I assume that flashback will appear sometime in season 3 when Monica talks to Pied Piper/Richard about it. It's probably going to lean towards Monica saying that she did what she did because her job was on the line or something along those lines; however nothing has been made clear yet."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,itzVash,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:02:08 2015 UTC,"It really seems like this season ended without them knowing if a third was going to be greenlighted. How on earth are they going to continue the series without Richard in the captains chair? There's no way to reinstate him, and there's no way Urlic is going to get any say, with his one vote. Due to his shares though, isn't Richard still on the board? They fired him as CEO, but he should still be a board member."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,IDontBelieveInIsms,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"The major importance of Richard being voted out is that he no longer holds directional control over the trajectory of the company. Raviga (holding 3 of 5 board seats) can install their own CEO to direct the firm as they want. They will either implement the head of Raviga as the CEO or someone more senior to Monica.   This means that Raviga now controls the direction and technological scope of Pied Piper. This means that they can shutter the company tomorrow and sell the IP. Or they can determine how to use the tech (video, music, etc). Or they can sell off stock immediately."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,IDontBelieveInIsms,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"All but one of those don't really help them though. Also, isn't it Richard who owns the IP? I thought that was what Peter alluded to in season one, he bought a piece of the company, but the algorithm (the IP) wasn't what he spent money on. In essence didn't Richard choose to create the company as a platform to sell his IP?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,azginger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:09:46 2015 UTC,"The company controls the IP which is not an issue when Richard is CEO and a board member. The IP is controlled by the company and the company is a vehicle for delivering that IP to market. Peter was referring to buying the company and not the IP. At that stage, he could have bought the IP (what Hooli wanted to do), but then he would have had to form a company around it to deliver the IP to market. So by buying into the company, he has partial control of an already formed company to deliver the IP.   Richard is still a board member but no longer CEO. This means that he has one vote as to the overall direction of the company not a day to day control like he had as CEO."
SiliconValleyHBO,3b1pwq,SoBetn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:24:39 2015 UTC,"But if he still owns 85 percent, he's still got a majority stake in the company, surely they couldn't impact his holdings that much?"

Also, whenever someone asks /r/movies for a good movie to watch, they'll always go for the ones some consider (although it's more of a joke term right now) ""underrated gems"", such as Dredd 3D, John Wick, Edge of Tomorrow, Drive or Moon.  tl;dr: Check out /r/moviescirclejerk and see the light."

Raviga continued sending Monica to the board meetings in Peter Gregory's old/Raviga's seat (from their initial investment) because Laurie Briem did not want to interact with Russ Hanneman, but they have no obligation to keep her on the board.  Now all this is not to say they didn't send her possibly as one of Raviga's three board seats during that vote, but unless she wants to lose her job, she'll vote as Raviga wants her to. Maybe her going against them (and possibly being offered a job by PP?) will be a plot point next season."

SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,bkervick,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:40:11 2015 UTC,So is the general consensus that Monica lost her vote?
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,supasteve013,7,Tue Jun 23 22:45:05 2015 UTC,"""Now all this is not to say they didn't send her possibly as one of Raviga's three board seats during that vote, but unless she wants to lose her job, she'll vote as Raviga wants her to."""
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,bkervick,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but say she votes against Raviga next season. She gets a job at PP. Raviga still has 3 board seats, so they could really just vote again, and make sure they get what they want. Right?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,monsieuruntitled,2,Wed Jun 24 04:27:18 2015 UTC,"Really depends what the company bylaws allow the board to do. Richard could call a shareholders meeting and add board seats, etc."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,bkervick,38,Wed Jun 24 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about Big Head, guys. Gavin Belson presumably just got voted out of his company as well, and I'm guessing Big Head will fall in to a dominant role at Hooli this next season. What if Hooli (Big Head) buys PP from Raviga to get Nucleus working, and he then brings Richard and team back in to manage it?   Kind of defeats the purpose of getting away from Hooli in the first place, so this theory could probably be tweaked a bit. Just a thought."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,ArchbishopHamster,33,Tue Jun 23 17:13:49 2015 UTC,Big Head's Hooli could be different from Gavin Belson's Hooli. Maybe the whole point of building up Hooli for 2 seasons as this big-ego tech conglomerate is to show that someone like Big Head can step in and humble the tech industry starting with Hooli and work towards real goals instead of proving that we're the fastest/best. Gavin was all about making him look like the mastermind tech lord of Silicon Valley. Big Head would simply and humbly lead.
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,trigaderzad2606,82,Tue Jun 23 17:24:55 2015 UTC,Simply and humbly lead?  Or turn the entire company into an unreliable potato cannon manufacturer?
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,goldenspiderduck,5,Tue Jun 23 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"A good replacement leader of Hooli would strike a deal with Richard (tensions with Gavin now gone) and if it's Big Head he can make Hooli less of an egotistical ass of a tech company. Sounds simple and the humility would come from BH's sense of ""I really don't know anything I'm just doing what my gut tells me to do"" attitude with running the company."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,trigaderzad2606,18,Tue Jun 23 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"Big Head gets promoted to CEO, hires Richard, who then fixes Nucleus in time to compete with Pied Piper. Richard becomes as important as Big Head to the industry, Raviga now wants Richard back as CEO for an absurdly high amount of money which Richard accepts. Big Head feels betrayed, their friendship falls apart and both keep trying to one-up each other for a while, making a lot of mistakes on the run and slowly losing focus on their products' original goals, making both Nucleus and PP worse on every iteration. Eventually EndFrame blows both companies out of the water, Big Head and Richard realize how stupid it's the situation they both dug themselves into, drop everything and become friends again, then the series end."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,calio,3,Tue Jun 23 21:06:37 2015 UTC,Richard and Bighead will definitely follow in Peter and Gavins footsteps (from close friends to bitter enemies). Richard will become more like Peter. More assholish. And Bighead will become more like Gavin. Egotistical.

SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,ed19,14,Wed Jun 24 00:48:17 2015 UTC,Or fulfill the prophecy laid out in the first season about Belson and Gregory being friends and split apart.
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,4-bit,3,Tue Jun 23 17:41:20 2015 UTC,"I think this is a brilliant insight into what they might potentially be going for.  However 2 issues with that idea are that Richard and Big Head's relationship was not really built up at all outside of a few small moments, and occasionally hanging out. If they want to go that route they should be building up their relationship more, as it would be an awesome story arc.  And secondly, Big Head has shown the opposite of ambition in comparison to Gavin. Big Head has no interest in legacy or actually working towards anything. His entire character is that he is incompetent and lazy. I cant imagine him actually trying to screw over Richard unless they completely change his personality after making him CEO of Hooli."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,CptnLarsMcGillicutty,2,Wed Jun 24 02:55:21 2015 UTC,What has Gavin ever done?   He doesn't seem to code.  Need d a team to get ideas.  Throws out good talent at behest of advisors.    Give big head enough time in an echo chamber of sycophants and have Richard jealous of him and we'll see.  It might also be Galvins redemption.    As for small moments I thought they said in season one they were best friends.  They might not have made a huge deal about it.  But it's a deal that is still out there.    We'll see.  But some thread will call back to that story arc somehow.
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,4-bit,2,Wed Jun 24 03:44:27 2015 UTC,"You might be right, but to me Bighead doesnt really seem to have ambition the way that Gavin does. Gavin wants to win at things. To paraphrase: ""I dont want to live in a world where anyone makes the world better than me.""  Bighead and Gavin have no qualities in common that I can see, so to put Bighead into Gavin's adversarial position would take a decent leap. But I guess I can see it happen.   Maybe Bighead will start to think that he must really be amazing, or have been somehow chosen for his position after being told so by the ""echo chamber"" and we will see him start to have delusions of grandeur because of how everything he does seems to turn into gold.  Cant wait to see what happens next season. Personally Gavin and Bighead are by far my favorite characters to watch."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,CptnLarsMcGillicutty,4,Wed Jun 24 07:05:25 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree.  I'm just wondering what the ""spiritual advisor"" will do.  We see him at the end starting to work on big head."

SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,andlight91,2,Tue Jun 23 21:10:08 2015 UTC,This was my idea as well. Maybe because it's predictable. More than likely it'll be something more awesome we didn't see coming.

SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Java_Beans,14,Tue Jun 23 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"I thought so too. I was thinking she had her own board seat based on her initial investment in the company, not just as a representative of Raviga. So doesn't Pied Piper have 6 total board seats? * 1. Richard  2. Erlich   3. Monica (a personal seat based on her initial investment, not as a representative of Raviga)  4. Raviga  5. and 6. Hannemann's votes that were bought out by Raviga"
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,comrade_leviathan,37,Tue Jun 23 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"Does Monica have her own? I thought it was: Richard (1), Erlich (1), Monica/Raviga (1), and Hannemann (2) for a total of 5.    When Hannemann first joins on before the board meetings Erlich / Monica make it a point to say that they'll be able to vote majority over anything Hannemann wants.  Now that Hannemann sold to Raviga, the ending of the S02 finale made it pretty apparent to me that Raviga essentially strong armed Monica into voting ""party line"" hence the removal of Richard."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,mmnml,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"So what happens now if Monica and Elrich vote one way, and raviga votes another and theres a tie?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,mmnml,18,Tue Jun 23 15:14:07 2015 UTC,"Well based on the phone call at the end it sounds like Raviga forced Monica to vote with them in removing Richard.  As it stands, Monica works for Raviga. Raviga had 1 vote THROUGH Monica, then got the 2 from Hannemann. That gives them majority vote, hence why Richard received the call saying he was outed as CEO.  I think the implication was that if Monica didn't vote party line, she'd have been fired and thus Raviga would get to use that vote how they wished anyway as it'd be under their control.  EDIT: If you were asking what happens NOW that Richard is removed, I'm guessing they'll be placing a new CEO. Either that CEO will get Richard's vote or Richard will keep his vote but be powerless as Raviga's 3 votes gives them majority no matter what Richard / Erlich want."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Jargen,28,Tue Jun 23 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"I think he'd still keep his vote. He may not be CEO, but he still owns Pied Piper."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Dark_Shroud,14,Tue Jun 23 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"The removed him as CEO, its a different process to remove someone from a board seat. Even then he still owns the majority share. Raviga only owns 5%."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Real_Clever_Username,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:45:02 2015 UTC,Don't they also now own Russ's shares as well?
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Dark_Shroud,5,Tue Jun 23 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"Russ never had stock, he gave PP a structured loan and part of the deal was two board seats.  The question is what kind of buyout did Raviga give Russ. It was clearly a few million. I'm betting Raviga bought out the entire contract/loan because the Ravgia CEO did not want to have to deal with Russ.  So this will be interesting to see how it plays out in Season 3.  I'm just tired of seeing the guys at Pied Pipper repeatedly fuck up in various ways."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,vreddy92,3,Tue Jun 23 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"No, no. Raviga has one vote from the initial $200,000 investment Peter Gregory made. They just got two from Hanneman, so they have a majority. They ousted Richard as CEO with that majority. Richard and Erlich still have board seats, but they're practically useless because now Raviga runs the company.  Monica invested her own money into the company, but didn't gain a board seat for that."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,mmnml,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:01:41 2015 UTC,Yeah. I was mistaken about Richard losing his board seat but the rest of it we're on the same page. :)

SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,QuickSkope,9,Thu Jun 25 22:24:39 2015 UTC,"Richard isn't CEO, but he still has his board seat. I think that's worth note."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,hitemp,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Everyone is forgetting this. CEO is a job, while a board seat is shares and a role in the company's growth. Similar to how Russ, an investor, had no employment role in the company, only cash and (poor) decisions"
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Porsche924,7,Tue Jun 23 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"Monica voted FOR Raviga. When they absorbed Hannemann's two seats, now Raviga votes 3."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,smokingcage,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"I would assume Richard still has a vote, but he isn't CEO."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,astroorion,6,Wed Jun 24 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, because of the mid-season meeting in Hannemann's house there were 5 seats voting (Hannemann, his girlfriend, Monica (voting for Raviga), Richard and Erlich)"
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Ashcz,2,Tue Jun 23 15:08:29 2015 UTC,Does Monica get her own board seat just by owning shares in the company? Is that how it works?
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Budddy,2,Tue Jun 23 15:08:41 2015 UTC,I thought owning shares meant that you had a board seat and then the power of your vote varied on how many shares you own but it may be different because it's a private company
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,kestrel42,5,Tue Jun 23 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"Ownership equity and board seats are independent of one another but are often parts of the same negotiations. Someone may give you money for a company but have no desire to have much input (no board seat) or may have a strong desire to invest but the company has many offers so they don't have the leverage to request a board seat (or multiple). Most investors will try to maximize their control for the amount they put in, but there isn't always a direct correlation of investments to board control. Especially true in companies highly saught after by investors."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,woakley,2,Tue Jun 23 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"So this confirms Monica never had a vote she just simply voted in Ravigas place. Although the fact that its Monica is irrelevant except it then becomes a more personal issue instead of just strictly business. As Monica votes for Raviga, Laurie could simply replace who votes with whomever she wants and still get her way. I'm assuming Monica did vote because of the call and doubt they just ran around telling everyone yea we voted to fire Richard as CeO.  I still think its odd that they were able to have a meeting without all the board members there."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,roundofapplesauce,3,Tue Jun 23 22:09:38 2015 UTC,the quorum for things like that is usually 3/5ths. since Raviga has three of the five board seats they can have board meetings and make those kind of votes whenever they want
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,kestrel42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:36:58 2015 UTC,Exactly. Even if all 5 seat members are present. The outcome is the same.
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Java_Beans,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:23:01 2015 UTC,Yet there is always the possibility that the other members could present an idea that persuades the others from making a rash decision.
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,dvidsilva,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:33:03 2015 UTC,"Aside from the whole seats thing, I wonder what's the reason that made Raviga oust Richard as their FIRST decision after taking majority? Do they mention in any episode that they don't like Richard leading?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,goggimoggi,3,Tue Jun 23 19:51:22 2015 UTC,"she says Richard was not looking at good business decision; something like streaming makes a lot of money, is a market PP should explore and we need a real adult to manage this. Is kinda common in the vallye."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,Dundunbanza,6,Tue Jun 23 20:25:30 2015 UTC,"Laurie said video was a bad decision.  Richard actually opposed doing the Homicide stream at first since video wasn't their core business, but Monica quickly persuaded him."
SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,xfinchx21,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:51:04 2015 UTC,I saw this as the only way that the plot could unfold. Monica votes with Pied Piper and against Raviga to keep Richard as CEO.

SiliconValleyHBO,3au3c1,helloiisclay,28,Tue Jun 23 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"No, she's voting for Raviga. Up to that point, Raviga didn't care much about the way Pied Piper was being run, but now they do. Monica could vote against her role as a proxy, but then she risks losing her job (and her ability to vote as Raviga's proxy.)"

If so, that frees Monica from losing her job, because if Raviga fired her, she would still have the board seat, or Raviga would void the contract. I think that all came during the funding phase though, so I doubt it was in writing, but it would make it interesting and give Monica a lot of leverage to support Richard..."

SiliconValleyHBO,3avbh1,Java_Beans,25,Tue Jun 23 20:10:49 2015 UTC,Good data compression is nothing without a solid platform. Sure you could compress files but who wants to do just that. I presume nucleus has a bunch of features that would rely on data compression.  Edit: also at Tech crunch Gavin announced a bunch of features. Basically their goal was to match the compression while using Hoolies resources to get more features into the platform and that then became  a mobile OS. Mobile would be good for compression because of data caps and smaller storage of cheaper phones.
SiliconValleyHBO,3avbh1,Bigsam411,12,Tue Jun 23 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"Basically with Nucleus, the Hooli OS would have data compression at its core.   It'd be using less bandwidth and less storage for everything it did when compared to other OSes like Android or iOS."
SiliconValleyHBO,3avbh1,SuperFreakonomics,9,Tue Jun 23 22:30:05 2015 UTC,The way I understand it is they are adding Nucleus support to the existing Hooli mobile OS. It is definitely confusing the way it is presented though.
SiliconValleyHBO,3avbh1,marvin_sirius,2,Tue Jun 23 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the scene where they were doing a test group with the phones makes it pretty clear its a mobile OS."

SiliconValleyHBO,3avbh1,the_smegma_of_christ,2,Wed Jun 24 04:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think they are using the tech to make a sort of remote desktop based O/S. Your phone is therefore just a viewer, any processing is done in the cloud. This is similar to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive a streaming gaming service.  Effectively this would future proof a phone and possibly use much less battery (although network usage would increase and screen usage would remain consistent). But that makes the episode with the lost phone even more inconsistent - they could just kill off access to the Nucleus cloud because the phone is worthless without it. It's also worthless without WiFi or a decent 3G+ connection."
SiliconValleyHBO,3avbh1,deyterkourjerbs,3,Wed Jun 24 05:42:01 2015 UTC,"I think the point behind the lost phone thing is that the user experience was terrible. Someone could perhaps reverse engineer it to make it operate without Hooli's authorization and reveal how terrible it is.   Alternatively, it was just a mobile OS with middle out compression for file storage, etc. in which case, it could reveal that Nucleus didn't actually have comparable middle-out tech to everyone else.   Either way, Hooli could potentially be in a world of shit."
SiliconValleyHBO,3avbh1,ionine,2,Thu Jun 25 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"OnLive:       OnLive was a Mountain View, California-based provider of cloud visualization technologies. OnLive's flagship product was its cloud gaming service, which allowed subscribers to rent or demo computer games without installing them on their device. Games were delivered to OnLive's client software as streaming video rendered by the service's servers, rather than rendered locally by the device. This setup allowed the games to run on computers and devices that would normally be unable to run them due to insufficient hardware, and also enabled other features, such as the ability for players to record and spectate gameplay.  The service was available through clients for personal computers and mobile devices, as well as through smart TVs and a dedicated video game console-styled device known as the OnLive Game System.

SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,C0demunkee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:26:06 2015 UTC,How many times did the writers have T.J. say 10%? It feels like he says it like every episode.
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,hopesdead,-27,Fri Jul 3 16:47:42 2015 UTC,"I just can't stand Erlich anymore and I don't understand why any of the other characters put up with him besides the housing situation. They had a talk specifically about not letting on that Richard's laptop had been in the shop and then Erlich blurts it out when it wasn't even particularly relevant and anyone with two braincells to rub together should have been able to see what their ""lawyer"" was trying to do.    He completely sold out everyone's hard work and effort, not to mention his own ""10%"" because he couldn't handle being (justifiably) dressed down for 5 fucking minutes.    He's a terrible friend and a shitty person. He's seriously the first time I've ever considered stopping watching a show because I just can't stand him as a character. Literally no redeeming qualities. He's just a giant flailing man-child.    Everybody talks about how tiring it is to see Pied Piper constantly get dumped on and how they can't seem to catch a break, but I'm more frustrated by the way they keep him around when he contributes so little and when they do succeed it's usually somehow despite him."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,SoulUnison,72,Mon Jun 22 23:17:23 2015 UTC,Seriously? I mean of course the laptop thing was stupid but there is an endless list of dumb moments that character's have had on this show. We have gilfoyle and dinish literally giving away the algorithm as well as Richard fucking up at almost every turn possible.  Of course Ehrlich's character is a dick but he is also a fucking hilarious character. I can't imagine this show without him.
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,Die4MyTiggers,22,Mon Jun 22 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"He is hilarious, but I wish he was funny in a way that wasn't always totally detrimental to his friends and the company. I think he just hits a little close to home for me. I have friends and family who are his exact brand of delusional narcissism with a dash of total lack of self-awareness and inability to ever take or even fathom responsibility for their actions.    Gilfoyle and Dinesh have had some dumb moments and they can be up their own asses, too, but I feel like they're at least there for Richard and each other and add something to Pied Piper with their technical expertise. Erlich feels like he'd sell his own mother up the river in a second if it'd stroke his ego, like when he was willing to sell the house right out from under everyone when he saw that he could get something out of it, and only changed his mind when he realized he might get more out of it.    He's incapable of thinking more than 5 minutes ahead and about anything outside of himself, and I find it maddening."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,SoulUnison,17,Mon Jun 22 23:27:28 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you're being downvoted for having an opinion. Its kind of sad that youve obviously watched the show but because youre not just talking about how awesome it is you get shit on. its like its not enough to watch a show for two seasons and then want to have a discussion about it. you have to have the opinions that everybody else has and you can't say anything bad OR ELSE.
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,RoundFaceTomatoGhost,7,Tue Jun 23 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"no, he's being downvoted for saying things like   like when he was willing to sell the house right out from under everyone when he saw that he could get something out of it, and only changed his mind when he realized he might get more out of it.   which is just patently false. the guys at the house had already accepted that they were likely going to lose pied piper anyway. they just wanted to see how far they could push what they created before it was taken away from them. and they kicked ass. erlich was not doing that shit to make money, he was doing it because he missed the fun and ""magic"", as jared described it.  but seriously circle jerk about downvotes and le reddiquette some more like anyone cares"
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,SeppGoodell,10,Tue Jun 23 00:58:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think he decided not to sell the house once he realized that the new owners were going to tear it down, the ""magic"" was secondary"
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,zombie_JFK,3,Tue Jun 23 06:51:15 2015 UTC,But maybe the reason he didn't want the house torn down is because of the magic that happened inside of it.

SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,spif_spaceman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:02:20 2015 UTC,"Well yes but I'd argue that was to protect the ""magic"" and integrity of what they accomplished there. Either way it certainly wasn't financially motivated and that's the point."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,SeppGoodell,2,Tue Jun 23 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"Again, it's not a ""you're wrong"" button, it's a ""you're off topic"" or ""this adds nothing to the dialog"" button. You're just crucifying the guy for having a different interpretation of the show than you. And obviously YOU care or you wouldn't have written a paragraph explaining why you care.    People complain that their subreddits are dead and there's no community and then a guy writes up his totally legitimate thoughts on the subject of the sub and you downvote him to pieces because he's not just blindly praising everything and jerking off in your faces."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,RoundFaceTomatoGhost,-1,Wed Jun 24 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"Or because he is wrong, like I said. Erlich was not coding for financial reasons. Why would you upvote something saying he was"
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,SeppGoodell,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"BECAUSE IT'S NOT A ""You're wrong"" BUTTON. LITERALLY the first line of my reply. Do you read or just react? He had an opinion and he stated it and explained it and it's a pretty fair interpretation. But go ahead and downvote somebody who's trying to have an actual discussion about the show. That way we can have thread after thread of ""quotes from the show"" and ""haha, I saw that too!""    Dude writes three paragraphs on his thought and gets buried, meanwhile the only two conversations left are just people going ""this funny thing was funny!"" and ""fuck yes great line!"" If I wanted to laugh about the show I'd just watch the fucking show. I go to subreddits about shows I like to see other's opinions and thoughts, but people just bury anything that isn't saying what they think the way they think it."

SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,RoundFaceTomatoGhost,4,Wed Jun 24 04:01:48 2015 UTC,"It's Reddit.    The downvote button is supposed to be ""This is irrelevant"" or ""This adds nothing to the discussion.""    Instead people more commonly use it as ""You put some thought into this but your views don't align with my own so I'm going to bury you"" or ""I don't like what you have to say but clicking the down arrow is easier than having to think about stringing together an actual rebuttal.""    It's echo chamber after echo chamber. It doesn't matter if I really enjoy the show and have seen every episode and bought the first season DVDs. I'm not enjoying it ""the right way"" and thus my opinions and thoughts are invalid."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,SoulUnison,2,Tue Jun 23 00:07:48 2015 UTC,"its more about the fact that he's bashing his character, thus neglecting the fact that his characteristics fit the narrative of life in silicon Valley, and how some people would do anything to get by over there. Bashing Ulrich because he's narcissistic and greedy while giving Gilfoyle and Dinesh a pass for being nice to Richard sometimes is weird. Maybe I understand Ulrich, because I live and work in the startup world, but basically, we all know that douchy self righteous brogrammer with his own startup/incubator. Also, how do you forget all those times Ulrich jumped in to save Richard when he had his little anxiety attacks and other problems."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,IHadaFishOnce,3,Tue Jun 23 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"Well in Silicon Valley most of the characters play off typical stereotypes of people that work in the business. There are deluded man children in tech, so it makes sense one would be in the show."

SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,C0demunkee,4,Tue Jun 23 00:29:37 2015 UTC,"Isn't he allowing the Pied Piper guys to live in his house for free? That in itself is a valuable service.   In any case, Richard doesn't have the money to buy him out, so they're stuck with him. It's absolutely believable that they'd continue to put up with his nonsense by choice or not.  Plus, he's funny and adds a lot to the show. Yeah, he's a jerk, but he often gets his comeuppance, so it's not like he's constantly getting away with being an asshole. I actually started to feel sorry for him this season, because it's obvious no one likes or respects him."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,Shenanigans99,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"well, at least Erlich didn't mind the hole on the wall and his house almost got burned down by Gilfoyle. wait... or did he?"

SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,spif_spaceman,4,Tue Jun 23 12:48:25 2015 UTC,"Elrich has stood up for Richard multiple times. He's the asshole that Richard can't be.  He's obviously also very insecure and aware of his own shortcomings which is why he freaked out when the lawyer started grilling him on the stand. I'm sure you would be cool as a cucumber, though, right?  If nothing else, he contributes the place that they all live and work in. That doesn't count for anything?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,headless_bourgeoisie,3,Tue Jun 23 02:35:15 2015 UTC,In the last episode he put his carpel tunnel gloves on and helped adjust the code base to handle the server load/capacity.  Erlich has helped them out a lot.
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,Dark_Shroud,2,Tue Jun 23 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you because I agree. letthedownvotesflow  I think he's an important character to the show, I just wish they would write him to have more intelligence and more value. All he really does is complain. The one episode where he voted against Richard just because he was mad at him and blew 30 grand really pissed me off. It's a great show, but it needs some better writing in some episodes."
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,mrkrabz1991,5,Tue Jun 23 02:51:02 2015 UTC,The entire premise of the show is that the protagonists are in way over their head. You can't fathom that someone with as fragile an ego as Elrich would do something petty like that?
SiliconValleyHBO,3arcof,headless_bourgeoisie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:15:03 2015 UTC,"He does show intelligence at times, you need to watch again more closely. He gives important tips to Richard and at times is the only one that believes in PP."

SiliconValleyHBO,3avyka,supasteve013,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:00:25 2015 UTC,True.
SiliconValleyHBO,3avyka,obrownleo,2,Sat Jun 27 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"Actually after reviewing some laws on ""Emergancy Board Meetings"" its safe to say that with no actual crisis at hand that needed to be dealt with within 48 hours thus meaning it can be called without all members present Richard may actually be able to take them to court, not sure if this will happen, if the show follows the rules of TV it will, but if it breaks away from the mould then maybe he won't return to Pied Piper.   As for big heads promotion as other people have suggested I think that may be the case, however it may not depending on if anyone at hooli other than gavin knew the reasons behind he's promotion...  the other thing I thought about it share holders control, all share holders get the right to vote when it comes to something like signing new board members, with Richard still owning the majority of the company surely he could just vote himself in? I'm not sure if thats how it works, its been a while since I have been doing business stuff  Gavin, i think will end up joining Pied Piper, since Raviga has enough board seats to vote him in, but the programmers will not be happy with him, kicking up a fuss, then I believe after a few weeks of this Raviga finally fire him and try and hire a new CEO, who the programmers again reject, eventually Monica talks enough sense into her boss to let Richard back in, but Richard has found something else and doesnt want back in, and eventually he will join back, but that will be the end of the season. This would be a classic TV pre-setout story line that has been tried and proved to work. I really hope we see something different this time."
SiliconValleyHBO,3avyka,OllysEdits,2,Wed Jun 24 21:03:40 2015 UTC,[Richard's] going to either work for Hooli or another company   Richard still owns most of Pied Piper. He's not going to go work for a competitor.
SiliconValleyHBO,3avyka,BrotherSeamus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:59:24 2015 UTC,"Big Head might become something big in Hooli and bring in Richard OR the more feasible way is, Bighead will be given the boot as well since his role in Hooli is not needed anymore.   On another stream, it will be interesting to see who Raviga will choose for CEO and if the guys will agree/disagree with him."
SiliconValleyHBO,3avyka,Java_Beans,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:46:49 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking the head of Hooli gets fired. Raviga grabs him to be the Pied Piper CEO, which was set up by making the position vacant in the cliffhanger along with Raviga gaining a majority vote. Richard is still the majority shareholder and stays with Pied Piper as CTO, and programmer, and on the board.  That puts the show into the ""square peg in a round hole"" scenario, as Gavin Belson does not fit in with the PP crew. Big Head promoted to CEO of a floundering Hooli. Hilarity ensues.  I don't see Richard going to Hooli or selling PP to Hooli. He's still a majority owner of PP, and the saga of him and the PP crew joining a large corporation would turn into a more typical workplace comedy."
SiliconValleyHBO,3avyka,TypoKnig,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"I think most likely Richard will become CTO (and founder of Pied Piper), keep his board seat, keep majority shares, and Raviga will hire a new CEO to handle all the business decisions.   With the failure of Nucleus and the Pied Piper lawsuit, Gavin is fired as CEO of Hooli and Big Head is made new CEO. The spiritual adviser sees that it's imminent, and goes back to acting like he did in Season 1 with the major difference being Big Head isn't motivated to do much.   Now, either:   Gavin is hired as CEO of Pied Piper and no one ever trusts him. Someone new is hired as CEO, and a new character archetype is explored."

SiliconValleyHBO,3aumm8,kestrel42,5,Tue Jun 23 22:17:29 2015 UTC,I prefer having a smaller number of well scripted shows where the creators have a direction and destination in mind across the entire season and beyond.  Shows with a large number of episodes in a season frequently need to return to where they started and you wind up with a boring situation comedy.  I'd rather have 10 shows hitting 90% on my enjoyment-meter than 20 hitting 70%.  Be glad for 10 - if this was the BBC we'd be getting 4-6 in a season.

SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,Saints2Death,21,Mon Jun 22 17:25:34 2015 UTC,He still owns the majority of the company but doesn't own the majority of voting shares. So basically he still is the primary owner but because the board has chosen to out him as CEO he no longer will choose the direction of the company.  Voting shares are the important part here.  You can own the majority of a company but without voting shares you'll never steer it unless you're CEO and since they've chosen to out him he is now just a shareholder.
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,danawhitesbaldhead,5,Mon Jun 22 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"Can the people with the voting shares dictate how much money goes to Richard's shares? Hannamon said something earlier in the season to the effect of Never show a profit on the books. Would Richard only get paid if they show a profit?  Also, if Pied Piper ever goes public, wouldn't Richard resume control over the board since the board answers to stock holders and Richard would own the majority of the stock?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,danawhitesbaldhead,10,Mon Jun 22 20:35:46 2015 UTC,No mark Zuckerberg doesn't own the majority of Facebook but he owns the majority of voting shares for Facebook and that's how he maintains control.  Richard gave up control by giving a seat to Monica if they ever go public he still won't be in control and his equity shares could be diluted I believe.  The rest we would need more info to answer I believe  I could be missing something though.  Anyone else care to chime in?
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,Wayne_Skylar,2,Mon Jun 22 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"But didn't Zuckerberg get compensated for his majority when Facebook went public. I honestly don't know how it works, but when FB stock was first sold, didn't he get paid for all the equity he owned that was sold in stock?   And how would his equity shares be diluted? Since he owns a certain percentage of the company, by law isn't that his to do with what he pleases? If Ravina sells more equity into the company per the board, wouldn't it come out of their share no Richards?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,tdietz20,2,Mon Jun 22 21:18:53 2015 UTC,"I realize this is a TV show, and not to look into it too closely, but here's my question. What's the relationship between voting shares and board seats? Because why wouldn't Richard's shares be voting shares? Assuming that Richard has 70% of the company and they're all voting shares, then he should have some way to control the makeup of the board right? Is the board not at the whim of the majority of voting owners?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,aspbergerinparadise,2,Thu Jun 25 15:36:44 2015 UTC,Did Raviga already have a board seat prior to buying Hanneman's two?  I thought Raviga passed on PP all together earlier and owned none of it.    Trying to reason how they wound up with three.
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,tdietz20,4,Mon Jun 22 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"Did Raviga already have a board seat prior to buying Hanneman's two?   Yeah, if you remember the board meeting they had at Russ's house, they talked beforehand about how Richard, Erlich, and Monica just needed to all vote together to have the majority."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,aspbergerinparadise,3,Mon Jun 22 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"OK thanks now I vaguely remember the scene, but why did Monica get one without any investment from Raviga?  Did Richard conjure for one for her simply to outweigh Russ?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,tdietz20,11,Mon Jun 22 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"The seat belongs to Raviga, not Monica.  Monica was just acting as Raviga's representatitve.  The board seat was created by Peter Gregory whose stake in the company was bought by Raviga after his death (iirc)"
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,danawhitesbaldhead,3,Mon Jun 22 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"oh right that's the part I was missing, Peter's seat.  Thanks."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,kestrel42,2,Mon Jun 22 22:13:38 2015 UTC,Monica had one and Russ had two I believe.  When they bought Russ out they ended up with 3. Monica would be forced to vote with Raviga to maintain employment so that's how I imagine they ousted  Richard.
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,IsThatJesus,4,Mon Jun 22 21:01:58 2015 UTC,Believe Monica voted in place of Raviga for Peter Gregory so  assume it wasn't her decision as Raviga had the 3 votes regardless of her choice.

Same scenario over at PP.  I don't know how it would happen, but I think that Monica will somehow secure one of Raviga's seats as her own, and will then jump ship over to PP giving them back majority control.  Or... next season could see the PP crew moving to a more traditional office space and bristling with the board's newly appointed CEO as they struggle to conform to a stricter workplace.

TBH though if the lawyer that PP has is worth anything (and I mean he would have to be a failure to NOT do this) the contract would trigger a reversal of the seats apon first non payment. Russ could fight it, but he wouldn't have control, nor the votes to remove Richard."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,basilect,2,Tue Jun 23 19:24:38 2015 UTC,What if Raviga honors the rest of Russ's contract?
SiliconValleyHBO,3aqcd0,GhostOfBong,5,Mon Jun 22 21:45:44 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the details of the funding agreement, but as soon as Russ missed a scheduled payment, PP could have rescinded the contract and the two board seats.

Both shows focus on a group of young men that are roughly the same age with roughly the same goal--money and success--the qualities of the ""ring leaders"" of each show (Vincent Chase for Entourage and Richard Hendricks for SV) dictate its direction. Vincent is attractive, uneducated playboy while Richard is a highly intelligent, socially awkward tech wiz. It's much easier to relate to Richard because of the way he handles the situations around him as well as the dichotomy between his innate brilliance and utter lack of self confidence.   Plus, who would you rather have as your friends? The Entourage or Gilfolye, Dinesh, and Erlich?"

Pied Piper then went to Hanneman for a $15m loan in exchange for 2 seats; Raviga bought out the loan from Hanneman, and now has 3 seats on the board."

Even that is an AMAZING reduction in bandwidth at only 1 Mbit/sec... remember, this is a 4K video stream they were talking about.  Netflix uses 25 Mbps to send a 4K video stream!    Again, this wasn't going to a data center or CDN somewhere with terabits of bandwidth connected to peering points, this was going to a guy's house in Silicon Valley."

But I didn't know that when they die, the corpses just stay there seemingly forever and you can pay caps to revive them.  I just redelegated everyone, reeled in my two wasteland wanderers and made do until they got back, used the couple grand in caps they had scavenged to revive everyone, and bam back to business.   It's a hard game to truly lose, especially when even the ill equipped dwellers seem to find caps in the wasteland faster than their health depletes.

SiliconValleyHBO,3ailqo,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Bluetooth low energy:       Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart ) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons,  security, and home entertainment industries.  Compared to Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range.  Bluetooth Smart was originally introduced under the name Wibree by Nokia in 2006.  It was merged into the main Bluetooth standard in 2010 with the adoption of the Bluetooth Core Specification Version 4.0.  Mobile operating systems including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry, as well as OS X, Linux, and Windows 8, natively support Bluetooth Smart. The Bluetooth SIG predicts that by 2018 more than 90 percent of Bluetooth-enabled smartphones will support Bluetooth Smart.

My phone's about dead."" and within 10 seconds three complete strangers offered me a lightning cable and a wall plug. It took literally zero effort on my part.  Richard could have easily turned around, walked inside the courthouse and asked the receptionist if he could borrow a charger. He would have had a solution in less than a minute.

SiliconValleyHBO,3aex4f,phorner23,6,Sat Jun 20 03:33:34 2015 UTC,"I think that comes from Last Week Tonight.  John Oliver is able to go after companies/individuals other stations stay away from for a multitude of reasons (political allegiances, ad revenue etc.)  HBO most definitely has product placement deals though.  Remember Tequila Avion in Entourage?  I know it's because the owner was friends with a producer or something along those lines, but it was still product placement.  HBO's money coming directly from subscribers only means they don't need to run ads for anything other than their original programs.  Do you think the Dell and Sony monitors in the Silicon Valley incubator were just randomly selected?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3aex4f,jordan_bar,-6,Fri Jun 19 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"If they had product placement in Silicon Valley, we would only see one brand instead of a mix of the most popular ones. You say the monitors in the incubator are Dell and Sony, yet if HBO was paid to use any brand it would be the only brand in the incubator. Characters also use a mix of Mac and PC laptops/computers and Android phones as well as iPhones and iPads.  I don't doubt HBO has product placement deals, but I do doubt they have any in Silicon Valley (probably John Oliver too). I don't watch Veep but I wouldn't doubt they have product placement there. It's pretty much impossible to have product placement in Game of Thrones. We'll see how the next season's lineup is. If any of those upcoming series has product placement it's probably Ballers, there's already something in the trailers about Axe body spray."

SiliconValleyHBO,3aex4f,MJZMan,5,Fri Jun 19 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"I think there's a bit of legal reasons behind that.

SiliconValleyHBO,3aex4f,Shotte,2,Sat Jun 20 00:38:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have a direct source for this.  I believe I heard it mentioned on a podcast that Kumail Nanjiani or Mike Judge was on.  I think a better way to phrase it is that HBO does not make money off of ad deals.  This doesn't mean that companies won't send them free stuff to use in their show.  However, HBO has the choice whether or not to use it on the show and they do not get any money for doing it.  This allows HBO to create shows that don't have to answer to advertisers.  I did find a recent article on in show advertising for the new Entourage movie were they talked about the various deals that they have worked out with different brands.  In the article it does mention that HBO does not allow for paid promotions.  There is also this interview from 2011 where they talk with the owner of the tequila featured in Entourage and he specifically says no money changed hands."

SiliconValleyHBO,3aex4f,CrazyEdward,2,Sat Jun 20 00:33:22 2015 UTC,"Many brands appear prominently in the show. I don't believe that no compensation is taking place.  If the interview is true, perhaps they have free reign to incorporate the brand however they wish, positively or negatively.   He may have meant that in a traditional TV show you don't know what commercials are going to run so you play it safe and don't offend any potential advertiser. With product placement these agreements are worked out beforehand."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aex4f,yourethegoodthings,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:34:41 2015 UTC,It's more about the fact that they don't have any advertisers.  They don't have to worry about Coke/Pepsi/Faygo pulling their ad money if they piss them off during the course of a show.

SiliconValleyHBO,3ag32l,Team_32,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way when I graduated college (B.S. in Comp Sci). Felt like I was miles behind everyone. Didn't know the buzz words very well. Probably couldn't explain half of what I learned in school. There's also an air of condescension in the industry, where shitty code/bad practices are ruthlessly ridiculed (just look at Gilfoyle and Dinesh's constant pissing matches). To be fair, it is really fun, but when you're new, it makes you afraid to be the butt of the joke.  I was unemployed for a while with no confidence til I had a job practically dropped on my lap from an old professor.  When I started working, they stressed all the time that if I don't know something I should ask questions. I knew the programming language but none of the libraries they were using. At first I was afraid of looking like a moron, not know the basics of Hibernate or JBoss or even some simple linux commands, but eventually they managed to drill into my head that they knew what they were getting, hiring someone fresh out of college. They didn't expect me to know all the functions of every API inside and out. They just wanted someone who, given the resources, could figure it out. And ask questions when stumped.  Three years later, I've learned a lot, but there's still a lot I don't know. I have a lot more confidence, though, that if I really wanted to learn a new technology, or even switch companies and learn the ins and outs of their software, I have the tools to do it."

On the flip side, the train would've taken all of 20 minutes.

You're not going to find people coding on iOS or Android for instance.  Regarding how they code and publish; depending on the coding platform you're using (there are many) you will install on your computer certain programs that will facilitate the coding and publishing.  Hope this helps."
SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,Fooomanchu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"you're off to a great start with codeacademy. Honestly, it is one of the greatest things to have ever happened for people like you and me who want a solid intro to programming. The tools you use to write code are usually applications called IDE's ( integrated development environment ). End of the day, code is just text, so you could technically use any text editor, but the IDEs have really advanced features that automated things that make your life easier.   To build on top of Foomanchus comment, a lot of people, especially in the real silicon valley, use iOS because the ""system"" underneath it is unix. This is important because a lot of server tools and languages also run on unix. So you tend to find a lot of web developers, especially at startups using iOS versus windows. On windows, you can do the same exact stuff, but you have to install a lot of 3rd party programs to bridge the gap. I personally use windows and do the latter option.   Lastly, I just found out that if you plan to make apps for the iphone, then you technically have to have a mac. Apple's terms and agreements say that if you develop using a non-mac machine, they can pull your app. So that's a consideration too.   Oh as for the ""publishing' part. A team like pied piper use version control systems like ""git"". This is what they were talking about on the last episode of season 2 when they are deleting the ""repository"". You have multiple copies of your app or site. One runs on your computer, and one that is live out on some server somewhere. When you are satisifed that whatever changes you made are bug free, you publish by syncing up the live version with the updated local version. That is a simple ELI5 of the process, but something that I just didn't get when I started out."

SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,infected_scab,3,Sat Jun 20 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"You can write code on any computer.  You can write html, javascript, css, etc. just using  a normal text editor like notepad.  Most programmers normally use programs like vim or sublime to write code because they were made specially for that.  They have syntax highlighting  and other helpful features.  Some languages like java, people normally write using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Eclipse.  With eclipse, you can see errors without having to compile the code and it will let you know what libraries you need to import, etc.  Although you can program on any computer, programmers usually have computers with a good amount of ram and a nice cpu so that the code runs fast.   Larger projects, important project, and projects with multiple people working on them are typically version controlled using something like git (you might have heard of github) or svn.  People can push to and pull from a central repository, so that they all have the same code and can revert back to a previous revision of the code if something goes wrong."

I recently spent two grand on a custom built desktop that is top of the line everything, and obviously it's a much better experience, but there isn't anything I can make with this that I couldn't build on my laptop, it's just a much better experience on my desktop because everything runs faster and smoother."
SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,TransPM,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:11:37 2015 UTC,"When you write code, your really just making a file, and just like any other file, it needs to be opened or run in a certain way. If you really wanted to, you could write code (say for example some java code) in notepad on any computer, then just choose to save it as mycode.java. You could then run it using some command line stuff, though I'll be the first to admit, I'm awful with anything command line/terminal.  But there are easier ways! Notepad is usually used for text files (.txt) because it's so simple. Here's something to try out: open up notepad, type up some stuff, then save it as a .txt. Once you have your file, open it again, but this time using Microsoft Word (or whatever word processor you have on your computer). The file should still open because it's just a file, but now it'll be much easier to work with because you're using a word processor that comes with more features to help with making text files and documents. Stuff like moving text to the next line when you reach the edge of a page, underlining typos, allowing you to include images, etc.  In the same way you opened your .txt you made in notepad with another program (Word), you can open that example mycode.java file with another program that has features designed to make writing code a more pleasant experience. These programs are called IDEs (Integrated Development Environment). Eclipse is a pretty popular one, but there are lots of IDEs out there, though it's important o note that not every IDE works with every coding language (just like how if you use a newer version of Microsoft word and save a file as .docx, some other word processors, like Apple's ""pages"" I think, can't open the file). Another great thing that IDEs do is allow you to run your code with the press of a button (no messing about in command line), and usually come with the necessary files to allow you to run code written in a given language (you can't just run java code unless java is up to date on your computer... though it likely is... But you might not have another language, like python, installed).  IDEs are great tools, but to a first time coder, they can still be a little daunting. If you're apprehensive about choosing and downloading an IDE to get started, I would recommend looking into a site called [cloud9.](c9.io) If you have an email address, you can create a free cloud9 account. From there you can create and edit workspaces in an IDE that's housed entirely in your browser (with no need to download a thing).   If you're having trouble getting started on a project from scratch, you can also make an account with GitHub, and connect it to your cloud9. GitHub is a place that allows coders to post their projects, either to store for private use, or make available to the world (open source). If you find an open source project you like, you can make a new workspace in cloud9 and tell it to ""clone from the URL"" of the project on GitHub, then you're free to edit and play around with your own copy of the code.  Lastly, there are tons of computer science related subreddits out there with people who would love to give advice (probably better advice than mine) to a newbie if you look around."
SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,XtremePrime,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"1) There's no such thing as a ""coding computer"". You can code on basically any desktop/laptop (with the exception of specific stuff, like if you want Windows 8.1 Phone dev, you need Win8.1 or if you want iOS dev you need Mac OS X) 2) They use text editors like sublime/vim to write their code and just compile/interpret it. Or use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 3) Publishing code is a bit hmm, but if you want to you can always use Pastebin to post single file projects or GitHub for bigger projects."

SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,Thasc,2,Fri Jun 19 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, the best things to help along the learning process are a) do projects, either inspired by your own will or places like r/dailyprogrammer, and b) read other people's code (e.g. on GitHub). In all cases, it's best to do projects that you find engaging, if possible. Some projects will push you in terms of algorithmic thinking (so that you don't write code Gilfoyle would scowl at), others will push you to learn frameworks like ASP.NET (i.e. the nuts and bolts of actually making a working product), others will be a mixture."

SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,BottomNotch,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:57:42 2015 UTC,"For Github, start with just reading code and see if you can get a handle on what each line is doing, then each function, then class. If you see a construct that you don't recognise, Google it and see if you can experiment with it yourself. Don't worry about big external frameworks just yet, just get your language down. Make a simple text game by printing stuff to the console and reading the player's response."
SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,TheScapeQuest,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:40:28 2015 UTC,"Websites are good to learn how to code: how to create a function, how to make a variable, how to even write a class.  When you know the basics, it's time to start with books. Books will teach you how to think like a programmer: where do you put what code, design patterns, ... general higher leven stuff.  As for your checklist: what language are you learning? Are you going into the direction of web development or more the programmer direction?  If you're going into web development you have to practice building websites. First create 1 page websites about things you like. Add images, lists, links. Then work your way up.   For proper programming you can check out the Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/) and try to solve them. And perhaps you have your own projects you want to try.  good luck! If you have questions, I'd love to help you out! I was once a beginner as well, and had some help from other people, which I'm very grateful for."
SiliconValleyHBO,3af1kl,512austin,0,Fri Jun 19 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"You can essentially use any operating system to code, you just have to make sure your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and a compiler are compatible with your OS.

As you said, Monica was the one who pushed them to do video; the Homicide thing was related to that, and was Erlich's idea; the Intersite deal was Gilfoyle. All three times Richard initially said no and allowed himself to be talked around. I wonder if that's meant to be the point, that actually Richard has good instincts but defers too much to more confident people, and once he stops doing that he'll be a good CEO."

SiliconValleyHBO,3adycl,SporadicPanic,3,Fri Jun 19 13:31:13 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with you. These examples demonstrate his failure to lead regardless of whose ideas they were originally.

SiliconValleyHBO,3adycl,SporadicPanic,4,Fri Jun 19 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"Richard is not a good CEO.  Nothing so far in the 2 seasons has shown that Richard has any of the requisite skills to lead a company.  The closest person is Erlich, who--for a brief moment of competency--was shown to have the Vision of the company and the ability to express it in a meaningful fashion to Peter Gregory. (this while Richard was throwing up in the bathroom and then dousing his trousers b/c they got a little bit wet).  While I think Erlich has been hilarious this season, I will say that one of my disappointments is that he's been protrayed too much as a total bumbling fool and that what seemed like his core competency in s1 were tossed aside."

No, they don't. ""Classic"" automatic gearboxes (i.e. approximately all automatic transmissions until about 20 years ago) have a torque converter (a fluid coupling) rather than a clutch (mechanically-operated friction plates). Semi-automatic gearboxes, like in the McLaren example, have clutch plates, but no clutch pedal, as already mentioned. Most non-sporty automatic gearboxes still use torque converters and planetary gearsets, not a computer-controlled (or any) clutch and normal gearbox."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,hrdrockdrummer,2,Thu Jun 18 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Did anyone else find the ""Ulrich almost selling the house/randomly starting to code"" not very believable and and kind of forced?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,capitanogoodhue,20,Thu Jun 18 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"Not particularly. Erlich is clearly driven by money and upon hearing that Noah got a pretty penny for his land/house he was naturally interested. Then when it came time to finalize the deal and he was told that the house would be torn down, he thought about/saw how special the house was (which OJ earlier tried to convince him of).  When Noah was giving the guys a hard time a few episodes back about how their house wasn't zoned for business, Erlich went as far as to compare Pied Piper to Google/Apple being started in garages. So it is pretty apparent that Erlich would support Pied Piper (and begin to help coding) in the hectic times that working out of your garage/house will create (i.e. Gilfoyle breaking through his wall to feed cord through it and almost setting the Incubator on fire).  Maybe this isn't entirely believable (but hey, its a comedy), but to say it is forced is a bit far. It was good to see the breakthrough (no pun intended) with Erlich coming out of his self-centered shell to help the gang for a second after fucking up in the courtroom and potentially giving Pied Piper away to Hooli. Although, I guarantee will he will be right back to how he was the majority of the season as soon as season three begins."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,postdarwin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:11 2015 UTC,I'd guess about 5 million for the house. Not too shabby.

SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,FrozenRyan,0,Fri Jun 19 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"Camon man, the entire episode was forced:   Selling a house in 1-2 DAYS OUT OF NOWHERE to give rushed drama. They should have set this up way better. Sending a message to delete it all without hearing the full veredict. Battery is dead, gotta go fast so they won't delete. Rescue team timing with the egg guy when he was about to crash the servers by drinking piss.   Also this gif, they suddenly needing an extra coder and Elrich without any set up whatsoever, without any knowledge about all the architecture of the platform, without any mention the entire season about him knowing how to code, how fucking convenient just to give some feels-good moment. Don't say he could have known the system when 90% of the scenes is him smoking pot doing nothing, and this is not even the third worst episode of this season.  Honestly I like the series but this season had a new level of bad writing and tech inaccuracy, actors really carry the show. There are many comedies where things aren't that forced."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,bayesisloaded,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"Surprised you were downvoted for this. I love the show but had the same reaction to the S2 finale: lots of stagey melodrama, with goopy music in the background, implausible/sentimental turns, and very few jokes, most of which were recycled. (Russ's cameo was like a mall signing, showing up to do his door thing and point out that B is for billion, and the bastardizing of the lovely 'always blue' ending from the first episode was lame too.)   Felt like the script was rushed, with too many half-baked revelations that undid two seasons worth of development. I wonder if this has something to do with the pressure the writers must be under this year; maybe they've just hired too many random people. S1 was A+ start to finish, but S2 has been erratic, with two terrible episodes (premiere and finale) and the poor handling of key characters (Erlich getting bitchy and desperate, Jared getting way too weird) that you get when people who used to watch the show start writing for it.   Hope they sort it out in the offseason, the show is way too good to lose."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,DerekStu,2,Mon Jun 22 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"Well, his ""randomly starting to code"" was not actually coding.  He was talking about setting up Varnish, which is a cache server.  Presumably he used it to scale Aviato.  So what he was doing would not actually require knowledge of their code."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,RockLoi,-3,Sat Jun 20 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"Well Silicon Valley is all about one dimensional characters really. It doesn't really do character development it's just about putting these hollow characters in funny situations, like Seinfeld.  Erlich's change of heart felt forced because it wasn't really sincere development, just a means to an end - a couple of gags about carpel tunnel and playing on Jared's optimism.  e: who exactly has had any kind of character development then?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,hrdrockdrummer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think a show like this works with no character development since every episode is a continuing story, unlike a show like Seinfeld.  The story evolves and the characters need to evolve with it."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,RockLoi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:17:32 2015 UTC,Why do they? They haven't so far and I don't think it's been an issue.  Just because the series of events is more linear doesn't mean that they can't still mirror the episodic style of Seinfeld; it's actually one of the reasons I like it.
SiliconValleyHBO,3a9wyt,ceecizzy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"IMO, great character development on both ends; Erlich taking Jared seriously and finally setting his own personal interest/agenda aside to help the team, while Jared showed that he can be quite confident when it comes to something he strongly believes in, and asserting himself against as abrasive a personality as Erlich's is pretty ballsy. I feel like this is the first time these two characters are making a breakthrough in their friendship. Erlich's smirk after he told Jared to shut the fuck up while he's working is probably the first time he genuinely aknlowledged Jared, and showed that he's not always as crude as his words are."

Generally, the compression algorithms are developed by people in the companies that back the firm, not at MPEG LA itself.

This was a company that, like Pied Piper, specialized in compression, and was eventually bought by Google for $124.6 million in 2010.  MPEG LA, LLC had claimed that VP8 (now WebM) infringed on their patents, and in 2013 Google and MPEG LA settled their disagreement."

Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it.  The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.

If you're interested I can go into why, but it's pretty unassailable mathematics.  There's a lot of interesting history behind compression, which Richard skims over briefly when he's presenting at TechCrunch. He mentions Huffman coding, which is a really basic form of compression. There's also things like run-length encoding which are pretty simple to understand.  Something more recent would be Lempel-Ziv, which is now Lempel-Ziv-Markov but that's pretty technically dense."

SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,TrashQuestion,14,Thu Jun 18 19:12:41 2015 UTC,"I think it also has to do with the fact that winning the case was the last hope for Nucleus and now that they've lost, Nucleus is going to fail. A lot of the failure of Gavin is him putting so much work into Nucleus and having it be a giant failure, he was trying to pawn off the failure on various other people and failed, so the failure of nucleus is his responsibility."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,Tyrannosaurusb,11,Thu Jun 18 20:06:59 2015 UTC,The board figured out that Gavin was a complete farse.    nucleus live streaming was a disaster promoted bag head multiple times nucleus mobile was a joke  sued pied piper as last ditched effort to get decent technology back and failed.    The lawsuit was the culmination of the falling of his house of cards.
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,EJayDoubleU,5,Fri Jun 19 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"This is probably the most accurate answer. I would only add that the arbitration was a HUGE problem for Gavin. The board had no idea Nucleus was a total flop (they thought it was just in development and Gavin's PR moves were premature). Pied Piper was dying from a lack of funding and poor leadership (Hannaman tried selling PP and the company deleted the porn companies files).  From the board's perspective there was no reason to arbitrate.    The only reason Gavin can give them is that Pied Piper got a Nucleus phone (through ineptitude of Hooli policies regarding prototypes), was going to expose Nucleus (and thus Gavin) to tech bloggers, and that he needed Pied Piper's IP right now to save Nucleus (and himself).    Moreover,  the number one rule of any lawsuit is to make sure it can't come back to bite you in the ass. If Gavin had agreed to only arbitrate the IP issue, the judge would have never known the contracts were invalid. Gavin should have had his lawyers look at the validity of the contracts before seeking damages from Pied Piper for breaking Donald/Jared/O.J.'s. Upon realizing they were invalid, he should have withdrawn the suit, kept it out of arbitration, and quietly ""renewed"" all existing employee contracts.   TL:DR: Gavin was a terrible CEO and his most obvious mistakes were made while trying to hide his ineptitude. This lead to many flaws being exposed."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,moobiemovie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:52:22 2015 UTC,ahh so its not because of the contracts but because hes incompetent elsewhere.
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,IgotAguy,-1,Fri Jun 19 02:57:21 2015 UTC,"No it's definitely because of the contract. Richard tested the pied piper code on company property while he was employed, but since Richard's contract was written up illegally, he was never considered an employee of Hooli."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,Tomlinsoi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"yah i understand, but the contract's terms aren't Gavin's problem necessarily. Hooli should have an Ace legal team to spot shit like that."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,Apprex,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"Promoting Bag Head may not be seen as a joke by them however, the finale definitely showed some of the other staff taking a serious interest in him."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,altogether-andrews,9,Fri Jun 19 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about contract law (or anything at all, really) but as the CEO of Hooli, Gavin could be considered a representative of the whole company in the contract (he probably has to sign it also) and as a result is held responsible for any issues that are not voiced by his own volition.  Or he's a scapegoat. Probably the more likely option."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,altogether-andrews,5,Thu Jun 18 19:25:00 2015 UTC,"As the judge said, the breach of employment law wouldn't have been noticed if Gavin hadn't vindictively included Pied Piper hiring Jared as a charge in the lawsuit."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abgg3,technicalityNDBO,2,Fri Jun 19 06:43:38 2015 UTC,i still don't think it's Gavin's fault really. Hooli should have a legal team good enough to spot that flaw in the contract.
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Scotty425,21,Thu Jun 18 18:39:44 2015 UTC,"Monica herself doesn't have a board seat, she was just sitting in for Raviga."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,SirPasta117,15,Thu Jun 18 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"This is accurate. The Board is currently made up of Richard (1 Seat), Erlich (1 Seat) and Raviga (3 Seats).   Monica personally does not have a Board Seat, she is a representative of Raviga and likely acting as a proxy. Once Raviga decides to vote a certain way, Monica would have to vote that way or likely be fired. She got away with more autonomy when Raviga and Laurie decided to distance themselves from PP. If she continued to vote against Laurie/Raviga, she could have been replaced by another proxy designated by Raviga.  This is the same way that Russ had 2 Board Seats and appointed his wife that didn't know the difference between lemons and limes. She didn't actually have a seat, Russ had both and appointed her as a proxy to the other.  The more interesting question is the stock ownership. Richard still has roughly 85% of the company (10% to Erlich and 5% to Raviga). I do not remember the details of the deal with Russ. It is most likely that there is two classes of stock (voting and non-voting)."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,BoAwayAccount,8,Thu Jun 18 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it is difficult to communicate which you want with someone who is a native Spanish speaker. In Spanish a lime is limon, and a lemon is lima."

SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Skoden,2,Thu Jun 25 14:14:16 2015 UTC,"I thought the original deal with Russ was structured more as a loan, so I'd assume he owns zero percent? This is just my guess though"
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,JontheGreatest,2,Fri Jun 19 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this in another post but for the board to approve the sell of Hanneman's shares to Riviga AND for the board to fire Richard would require a quorum. Since Monica, Richard and Erlich weren't give notice nor given the opportunity to vote the meeting and it's actions would be invalid. Since Monica looked dumbfounded, I guess she did not vote.  There seems to be some debate as to how Monica has the board seat. Whether by proxy of Riviga or as stated by Richard for the original Riviga funding (or her own funding of PP). Either way a vote is needed to remove a board member. Even if it's by proxy. If a board member cannot attend a meeting and sends a one time proxy - then that is different.  Correct me if I am wrong."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,TinBurner,3,Fri Jun 19 03:21:29 2015 UTC,"I have just rewatched some of Season 2 that would shed some light on this.  When PP negotiates with Raviga for funding, Richard requires that Monica votes for Raviga's Board Seat. Raviga agrees, but this deal ultimately falls through when Hooli sues PP. However, Raviga still has 5% interest and a Board Seat. Monica votes that Board Seat, but it still very clearly belongs to Raviga, not to Monica personally.  Even if it was Monica's, Raviga would have had a quorum to vote (3 Board Members Present). If the vote went 2-1 to remove Richard, it would still pass."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,BoAwayAccount,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:52:18 2015 UTC,Good lead... though I am drawing a complete blank... when the deal fell through how did Riviga retain their 5% and board seat if they rescinded funding (deal falling through)?
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,TinBurner,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"The more interesting question is the stock ownership. Richard still has roughly 85% of the company (10% to Erlich and 5% to Raviga). I do not remember the details of the deal with Russ. It is most likely that there is two classes of stock (voting and non-voting).   Yea, so wouldn't Richard just use his 85% or whatever to add 2 more seats, Dinesh and Guilfoyle. Or to vote someone else holds the seats currently held by Raviga?"
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,mtbeedee,4,Fri Jun 19 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"As /u/sirpasta117 stated Monica doesn't have a board seat she was sitting in for Raviga .    However, her sitting in for Raviga was part of Richard's acceptance of Raviga's evaluation of Pied Piper's worth. This was after the death of Raviga's original CEO.    As long as Monica works for the company she has the board seat."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,moobiemovie,2,Thu Jun 18 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so that means that Monica did indeed vote to fire him."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,FatalErrorr,5,Thu Jun 18 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Since Monica works for Raviga, the firm has control of the board seat but she was simply voting as a proxy on Raviga's behalf back when Russ had his board seat. Now that Raviga has all three seats, the CEO likely made her relinquish control of the board seat so that decisions could be made through the firm as a whole, rather than through a single person whose ideas may not best represent the firm."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Apprex,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"As moobiemovie said,  ""However, her sitting in for Raviga was part of Richard's acceptance of Raviga's evaluation of Pied Piper's worth.

SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,FatalErrorr,2,Thu Jun 18 21:28:35 2015 UTC,"True. For all we know, she could've been coerced into voting to remove Richard by her boss."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Apprex,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:41:49 2015 UTC,I don't think that's possible. I think they removed her seat (violating the agreement) then voted. Thus making the vote invalid.

SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Saints2Death,4,Sat Jun 20 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"Monica votes for Raviga's interests.  When the board seats were discussed here a few days ago the situation seemed to be, as far as I understand it, that Monica has a PP board seat and can't just be removed by Raviga on a whim. She could technically vote against Richard being removed but she would lose her job.  Richard could always offer her the CEO position in exchange for her vote coming over to his camp though."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Ungreat,2,Thu Jun 18 20:22:53 2015 UTC,There's no way that Monica willingly voted Richard out it would be completely out of character for her.
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Energizee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:51:10 2015 UTC,My question is how did they have a board meeting without 2/5s of the board members being present.
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,suss2it,6,Thu Jun 18 21:02:34 2015 UTC,"You typically only need a quorum (majority) to call a meeting. When that majority calls the meeting, you only need a majority of the votes that are present.   If 3 out of the 5 members call a meeting to vote out Richard and the vote goes 2-1, it would still pass, even though less than a majority of the Board voted for it."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,BoAwayAccount,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think Monica voted. But you are right about needing a quorum.  And once Hanneman gave up his shares, there where only two people in Laurie's office to vote using the 2 board seats that were exchanged. So physically speaking Riviga could have voted two max regardless of Monica's voting status.  You need physically present board members to vote. Unless there was a call in I suppose :)"
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,TinBurner,2,Fri Jun 19 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"There were 3 people in the office: Laurie, Monica and the secretary guy."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Falcooooo,0,Tue Jun 23 04:04:57 2015 UTC,"So what is the majority can essentially make themselves the sole controlling agent in a company? Can they also choose to not replace the empty seats? Cause effectively, they can remove the opposition and never have to replace them which effectively makes them having 100% control.   I think the main focus of next season would be who becomes Richard's replacement and what direction the new CEO takes the company."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Emptyadvice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"It was an emergency meeting, so as long as the majority was present, the meeting would be able to proceed. With only three out of five members, there's still the opportunity for a majority ruling (two votes to one, etc.), but since Raviga had control of the majority seats, they could make any decision they really wanted without having to consult Richard or Erlich."
SiliconValleyHBO,3abbvm,Apprex,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't there be a provision, though, that all board members must have notice? They gave none to Richard or Erlich."

SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,TinBurner,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:13:10 2015 UTC,No. They cannot. All private sales have to be approved by the board and in some cases the gov't.  edit: that was in regards to shares. sorry. Board members need board approval to sell their share then intern that new member has the former board members shares and seat. I don't believe you can just sell a board seat without the associated shares.
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,pjcelis,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:26:49 2015 UTC,Most of the time in small companies a selling shareholder has to inform the other shareholders of the nearing sale and allow existing shareholders to buy pro rata for the same sale price instead.
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,Dabugar,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:07:27 2015 UTC,Couldn't Monica have sided with Richard making it 3(PP) vs 2 (Reviga)?
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,starfirex,3,Thu Jun 18 19:10:33 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure she was sitting on the board on behalf of Raviga. So when mrs. soul-less held the emergency meeting she probably didn't invite Monica because she knew how Monica would vote.
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,Dabugar,2,Thu Jun 18 19:56:00 2015 UTC,I think she was probably concerned about keeping her job so decided to side with Raviga

SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,BoAwayAccount,2,Thu Jun 18 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"They didn't really have a choice, a better option might have been to try and expand the number of board seats to make sure PP always has majority."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,BoAwayAccount,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:41:36 2015 UTC,Is Monica able to side with Richard and keep her seat?
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,KeetoNet,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:18:05 2015 UTC,"Here is my attempt to make sense of the stock ownership: Hendrix - 85% Bachmann - 10%  Raviga - 5%  There is also a likely divestment of stock to Gilfoyle, Danesh, and Jared Dunn/Donald Dunn/O.J. as a part of their employment. I can only assume this would be non-voting stock and not be of any major significance (maybe 1-3% a piece since they got in early).  This is the amount of shares invested in Pied Piper. However, the Board is made up of Hendrix (1 Seat), Bachman (1 Seat), Raviga (3 Seats). I cannot recall the details of the deal with Russ, so maybe someone can fill me in (I believe it was a loan?)  The key distinction is that there has to be two types of stock (voting and non-voting). Otherwise, Richard would be the dominant shareholder and be able to take over the Board of Directors as a super majority.   Voting stock makes major decisions (board members, mergers) while non-voting only has an interest in the company. My guess is that the deal with Raviga provided Peter Gregory with significant decision making power but not with a majority interest in Pied Piper.  With regards to Raviga's seats, they belong to Raviga as a corporate entity. Monica does not own a seat personally, she is just a proxy for Raviga. Monica would be replaced and likely fired if she did not vote to remove Richard. It is the same way that Russ appointed the wife that did not know the difference between lemons and limes to his second seat. She didn't actually own it, it belonged to Russ and she was his proxy."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,ChigChiggimuh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:19:04 2015 UTC,"This is helpful. So then Richard has a ballpark of 85% ownership of a company that he no longer works for? Assuming the board simply fired him, not demoted."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,KeetoNet,3,Thu Jun 18 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"Yes. To make sense of it, there are shareholders, board directors, and officers.  Shareholders vote on the board of directors and other major decisions at the annual shareholder meeting. Board of directors vote on officers.  Assume there is 100 shares of voting stock. It would be safe to assume that Raviga now has 60 shares of it, Richard has 20 shares, and Bachmann has 20 shares.  With 5 board seats, the vote for the board of directors would go potentially like this:   Board Seat 1 - Raviga votes 20 shares and appoints the Board member  Board Seat 2 - Raviga votes 20 shares and appoints the Board member  Board Seat 3 - Raviga votes 20 shares and appoints the Board member  Board Seat 4 - Richard votes 20 shares and appoints the Board member  Board Seat 5 - Bachmann votes 20 shares and appoints the Board member   Raviga has 3 out of 5 of the board seats, meaning it has a quorum and can call a meeting and vote whenever it wants. Raviga calls a meeting to determine the CEO and votes 3-0 in favor of removing Richard, Erlich, and probably all officers.   At the next Board meeting, Richard and Erlich still have seats, they just don't matter  since they will always be outvoted. That being said, assuming that PP is worth the $250 million Gavin was willing to offer, Erlich is worth 25 million and Richard is worth $212 million.   Raviga controls the company, but does not own much of it. Their ownership total entirely depends on what Russ received when he invested."
SiliconValleyHBO,3aarm7,TinBurner,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for giving a rundown of this. I was unsure after this episode how a majority shareholder could be overruled by the board. I had conflated voting and non-voting shares, and since the show never really talks about how voting shares are split, I missed it.  It's on Richard for giving away so many voting shares so easily then. He should probably be fired for that."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a5noz,Namkcalb,16,Thu Jun 18 05:03:24 2015 UTC,"I thought Gavin -> Pied Piper initially, too. But that's too easy, and clearly predictable. I think it's important to note that Raviga wouldn't want to lose the guy that devised the platform, even if they want him out of the CEO chair, and that Mike Judge et al would not want to split the core of Pied Piper too much. you have to remember that PP is Richard's baby, and that Richard is, essentially, the hero here. Winning for him, means winning with PP. Nothing less.    What I can see is Pied Piper getting taken ever more corporate very quickly, and putting the core four (+Erlich) into different positions within the new corporate structure, setting them all at odds. I can see a lot of movement taking the middle-out algorithm further away from it's purest applications, and with ever more ridiculous and scope-expanding elements added on, bogging down the development cycle. Essentially, Pied Piper will end up taking the Hooli-phone path to bloatware. This would set-up a finale for our heroes to pull off another tech-coup, saving its bacon again.   Big Head is clearly destined for ever greater leadership positions. Hooli is a good bet, but again, somewhat predictable. Also, there should be enough people at Hooli that know him for what he is to make that potentially unrealistic. I could see him as the new CEO of Pied Piper; it would be ridiculous, but it would also allow for keeping Richard close. Gilfoyle and Dinesh would also lose their shit at that one.   As to Gavin's future, I find it hard to predict. Again, you have to remember that he is already extremely wealthy, so he doesn't need to work. But also, like Richard, his life is his company; he's going to want Hooli back, no matter what. I can see him getting spun as a less antagonistic figure now - the old (but good) trope of the early enemy becoming an ally would play very well. Imagine Richard getting mentored in the dark arts of the billion-dollar tech company industry by Gavin, and working schemes against the Raviga led board (he's still a voting member of the PP board, no matter what).   They will undoubtedly need to bring in a new character as the primary antagonist for the next season, and that's really got to be whoever Raviga selects for the CEO job. Pied Piper will have to start getting bigger. They need new offices, many more staff and they need to start getting into the big leagues. Erlich is going to go waaaay overboard with that stuff, but still get shut out by Raviga. His house still has to feature somehow.   I think there are a lot of interesting moving parts in play right now. I don't think situations will resolve with the kind of symmetry some are identifying. Richard can't get too far from Pied Piper; Gavin won't stay the 'big bad'; Erlich will always have a part to play; as Pied Piper inevitably grows, the core characters will remain significant.   Final thought, Jared would be a fairly obvious choice for CEO. He's already in the leadership team, he has an excellent CV (as Erlich pointed out), and he seems like the kind of person Raviga would get behind. That would lead to some really interesting, and very funny, conflict..."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a5noz,Mr_Evil_MSc,5,Wed Jun 17 13:47:26 2015 UTC,"I hadn't seen a prediction of Big Head being promoted to PP CEO and I think it's interesting. Theoretically everyone in the Valley (excluding the PP core, Gavin and maybe the Hooli Lawyers) thinks he is a genius that helped develop PP and shot up the ranks at Hooli, so I suppose Laurie and other top level Raviga execs (assuming Monica doesn't tell them, if she even knows that Big Head is a dunce. Does she?) could be buying into the Big Head hype.  The only issue I see with that theory is that if he were to be appointed CEO I don't know where the show would go with that dynamic. It seems as though he is a very humble person and has had no issues admitting that he has done virtually nothing to earn all the respect and praise he has been given. So him being appointed CEO wouldn't really change anything, he would just defer to Richard and the guys like it has always been, and then why end the season on the cliffhanger of Richard being fired as CEO. If they don't plan on bringing in a new obstacle for the PP core guys (in the form of a new CEO), which has basically been the main theme of this show (every time they overcome an obstacle 2 more pop up in its place) why include firing Richard in the first place? That's why I think the PP CEO will be Gavin, Monica or ""insert new character"""
SiliconValleyHBO,3a5noz,IWasRightOnce,4,Wed Jun 17 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I certainly think it more likely that BH will end up near the very top of Hooli; I think it's a side thread satirizing the sometimes ridiculous way SV handles leadership.   Richard was fired as CEO, but he still remains a part of Pied Piper. I really can see him coming under Gavin's influence, and Gavin becoming a more sympathetic figure. There were a number of moments in that finale that I think really weigh into all this. The symmetry of them both getting fired as CEO, which ought to bring them together, rather than just shuffle the pieces so that Gavin can be CEO of PP. The moment were he ties Richard's tie could easily be foreshadowing. Imagine Gavin getting his hooks into Richard, and working out another version of middle-out that he can use to rebuild. Gavin in the Erlich position as they go around the VC's...   And of course, the guru latching on to Big Head clearly shows he's going somewhere. Him going to Pied Piper would work, because he'd be stuck in between a demanding board, and an indifferent, if not downright hostile (Gilfoyle and Dinesh working for Big Head???), work-force, and he'd still be loyal to Richard, enabling him to pull whatever he needs to pull to get his company back.   Monica won't be CEO, that's simultaneously above and below her. she works for Raviga, and I don't think they'd put her in, even as an interim measure. Erlich talking about Jared's CV might also be an indicator as to where they're going. OJ would be similar to BH, but better placed to act as CEO.   But most of all, I really don't see Gavin continuing as the bad guy. I really think this shared misfortune moves him closer to Richard."

Either way, I agree- Big Head will be heading up, and I could easily see him slipping through the cracks and moving in to the CEO role for PP. I don't know much, but I do know that season 3 needs to start now so I can get my fix."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a5noz,otherpeoplesmusic,2,Thu Jun 18 14:18:09 2015 UTC,"I originally went with some of the more obvious routes too (Gavin/bighead scenarios for Hooli and PP).  One thing I think we are assuming is Gavin was fired. Now I'm not so sure. I think the Hooli board will clean house (brogrammers fired) but will retain Gavin. Remember they have to launch Nucleus. Someone will lead that to fruition next season - my guess Gavin with a new team. Also recall how the HR guy was adamant that all contracts with Hooli were always honored. Will be funny to see what happens to that guy.  For Bighead - I think he can only fail up. His cameos have been fantastic so far. But too much ""ah shucks - I have no talent"" would be overkill in S3. I think he survives the Nucleus/Hooli firings and fills a similar role he has previously had in the show.  For PP/Richard/Riviga - so many ways they could go, but if they are trying to be realistic they have a few options for a company at this stage of being. I could see a board war where Richard remains in the company but fights with his board for control. I think he and PP team win, then kinda get relegated back to Erlichs house - they don't get invited to the main office.  That house is a character to me.  Or PP/Richard/Riviga could reconcile quickly, and they move forward with a hostile board. The scaling of sales could be a funny tension. Product vs Sales is a classic scaling problem. Could introduce and antagonist who over sells PP and the guys have to play catch up and do crazy feature mods for pioneering new tech applications.  Thinking back the antagonist of the seasons was never directly money. Money was a goal but never the barrier, only the opportunity. I think that will continue in S3 - so whatever Riviga does it will more of a constant rather than an antagonist."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,Matt_notascientist,5,Wed Jun 17 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"The compression algorithm is probably OpenCL which is C/C++ and works with AMD graphics cards. All the algorithmic stuff will be C/C++ since it is running on their servers. They might use java for socket programming and interface stuff, but the main algorithmic stuff is most likely C/C++.  EDIT: OpenCL, not OpenCV"
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,jucestain,4,Wed Jun 17 16:19:26 2015 UTC,That makes sense. When you want to be efficient you don't really want JVM memory hog.
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,Matt_notascientist,-1,Wed Jun 17 16:33:11 2015 UTC,"Why you getting downvoted? Any memory efficient code should be using C/C++ since their specialty is low level memory management without going into Assembly programming. JVM is a creation of an entire environment on top of the OS. By definition, it's less efficient in terms of speed and memory."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,matafubar,7,Wed Jun 17 18:45:11 2015 UTC,"Because he's wrong, maybe? Yes, the VM is a self contained environment, but that doesn't necessarily make it slower - it's just virtualized. Additionally, bytecode is converted to machine code by the JVM dynamically so it's better able to produce more efficient code for the host CPU and use all of its features. Statically compiled languages cannot do this. So, yes Java is less efficient in memory due to the overhead required, but speed wise it's very performant for certain tasks which explains why it's so pervasive on the server side.   http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/java.html  In this example Java beats C++ in only 1 benchmark, but it's really not to far behind in the others.  Additionally, memory efficiency on servers is a non issue."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,hackerforhire,2,Wed Jun 17 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"Also notice the plural ""servers"". Many enterprise apps are built on Java specifically because it's a useful language for building something you'd deploy on a large cluster. Just because you theoretically could build something using a lower-level language and run a routine in a few less cycles or with less memory doesn't mean you can easily implement it to run on a large cluster. Designing your architecture to scale is extremely difficult, and something heavily optimized for a lower language will often be optimized for a particular scale, e.g. it could run extremely well for live streaming 100 different videos in parallel, but is inefficient for 1 at a time or 100,000. I'm not saying you can't design for this in C++, just that Java could actually be an appropriate choice."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,WdnSpoon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:23 2015 UTC,"Normally, memory efficient is a non-issue. But the PP guys are running a compression algorithm. Their entire business is memory efficiency and how fast they can compress things compared to something like End|Frame.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Java is bad or anything. When you run code in java, it converts it to byte code then the JVM converts into machine code as you said. And that's what makes Java a cross-platform powerhouse. But by that same token, that extra step of dynamically converting the btyecode to machine code of the specific machine it's running on makes it slower than something like C/C++. Also Java lacks the low level memory management that C/C++ has which I feel will help out with compression by a lot. There are definitely trade-offs."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,matafubar,3,Thu Jun 18 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"What does the amount of memory Java uses have to due to with the efficiency of the compressed object? A C++ or Java application using the exact same compression algorithm will produce the exact same output will it not?   As for the issue of converting bytecode to machine code, there may be a slight performance decrease on the initial run, but on all subsequent runs the hotspots have all been identified and the machine code has been generated. Additionally, the hotspot compiler will continue dynamically optimizing if it deems necessary.    The low level memory management would help out with the compression, but when you're dealing with the amount of data PP is wouldn't I/O be the biggest bottleneck? And Java has very good I/O support.   One more thing I'd like to mention is Java's excellent support for concurrency and threads/parallelism which is extremely difficult to do correctly in C++, but extremely easy in Java."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,hackerforhire,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:04:35 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really talk about the efficiency of what was compressed. It was more about what if the servers were overloaded with files and they needed to compress it all. With something in C/C++ you can deallocate data as you're compressing so just in terms of memory management, you can use it to it's fullest extent. I'm not even sure if you can explicitly deallocate memory with Java. You would probably have to rely on the garbage collector which takes up resources.  I believe all the networking would be written in Java. Only the compression would be written in C/C++. But you're right, the biggest bottleneck would most likely be I/O so I guess what I'm saying probably doesn't matter in the long run."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,matafubar,0,Thu Jun 18 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't really know any serious algorithmic libraries written in java. BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, suitesparse, and much more are all pretty much C/C++ (or fortran... but that's very minor). From my understanding Java has two main advantages over C/C++ in that debugging is easier, and it's much, much easier to port to other systems since it runs in a virtual environment. However. for Pied Piper all of their algorithms are written in house and run on their servers, so porting isn't important (at least that's how I see it). I don't really see why they would use Java to write their compute intensive algorithms when C/C++ is pretty much perfect for it. They can eek out every flop possible by even performing assembly optimizations (doubtful, but possible) if need be, which isn't available with Java."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,jucestain,2,Thu Jun 18 04:05:58 2015 UTC,"One of Java's main advantages is that it's much more of a higher level language than C/C++.  For example, excluding Boost::Filesystem, portability with I/O functionality can be an absolute nightmare with C/C++.  For example, how would you list directories in C/C++ that's 100% compatible with every compiler?  You can't, as there is no cross platform concept of what a directory is.  What about networking, threading, or UI?  Often what people consider to be C/C++ are not really in the language, but library extensions that are machine/compiler specific.  Not that this would matter at all to a company such as Pied Piper.  A compression algorithm would easily be within the base language."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,behindtimes,0,Thu Jun 18 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"What about networking, threading, or UI   Haven't done much socket programming in C++, but for multihreading there are plenty of options. C++11 has std::thread. There's also OpenMP for shared memory and MPI for distributed systems. For lower level stuff there is pthread. For pied piper they most likely don't need a UI since all that data compression stuff should just be abstracted and behind the scenes. And also, portability shouldn't be an issue because all of their software is run on their own server. They aren't distributing a software package for others to use- they are using in-house hardware, so I don't see why portability would be an issue either."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a61sj,jucestain,2,Thu Jun 18 04:49:43 2015 UTC,"You're still looking at it through a POSIX point of view, not a C++ point of view.  There are plenty of options because there aren't really any options to begin with.  (Yes, certain things are handled with C++11, C++14, C++17, but this all goes on to create issues when talking cross platform.  And what about C?).  And while their software is running on in-house hardware, part of the point, I believe, of what they're trying to do, is have an algorithm that is highly efficient in both terms of compression speed as well as compression factor.  He was planning on selling the algorithm to Hooli, not the machines.  That's part of what caught the attention to start the series.  The programmers at Hooli weren't impressed because he was running a (insert computer here), rather, he managed to losslessly compress a file better than they ever could.  The algorithm itself should be language agnostic.  He could have written it in VBScript for all they care.

SiliconValleyHBO,3a4dg3,piconet-2,14,Wed Jun 17 10:25:28 2015 UTC,"They didn't but it was hinted in Season 1.   I've thought Richard and Jared were cute together since S1 as Jared's the one in Richard's corner who's helped him with Pied Piper, looked out for his best interests and stuff, like, the most. As much as Monica helped, she's still at Rivega most of the time.   Also Thomas Middleditch said this during an AMA - https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/33xo63/i_am_thomas_middleditch_you_may_know_me_as/cqpbb1x  They'd be adorably awkward together I think. With random German death oaths in the middle of the night lmao.   I also think Gilfoyle and Dinesh woulda had drunken hatesex shenanigans? IIRC Gilfoyle was bisexual. I ship Erlich with everyone.    I ship hetero and non-hetero stuff in everything and really wish more people watched and wrote SV fanfics haha! Would be fun to read.   Hope I didn't offend anyone and I'm sorry if I did!

And I'm fully onboard with Richard/Jared, but the fact that Richard sleeps in what appears to be a child's bunk bed has got to make a romantic encounter with anyone tricky, let alone somebody who's like six foot four"
SiliconValleyHBO,3a4dg3,altogether-andrews,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:49:39 2015 UTC,I sense Erlich and Monica would be on late night munchies runs or get stuck in really irritating meetings and have casual hookups? They have a begrudging respect for each other. I did not catch the last few eps of Community but I love Jeff and Britta slightly more than Jeff and Annie or Jeff and Abed ;).   Logistically Richard and Jared're gonna need a bigger boat bed. I can only imagine most techie bachelor pads are that cramped in SV? What with startup pay and rent?

SiliconValleyHBO,3a60h5,earthtoannie,6,Wed Jun 17 23:22:34 2015 UTC,I think bighead will be named the CEO of Pied Piper and secretly let Richard run everything while taking all the credit which will eventually lead to a huge falling out between richard and bighead.
SiliconValleyHBO,3a60h5,traitorofthelostark,2,Wed Jun 17 21:40:29 2015 UTC,"My guesses:   Gavin gets voted from CEO, but Raviga hires him as CEO for PP since he has experience Richard will stay at the company as a worker bee but will slowly work his way out of his awkward shell (It'll be a growing season for him) and earns his rightful place as CEO of PP Bighead will keep getting lucky and land the job as CEO for Hooli. Throughout the season he'll keep getting luckily as he leads Hooli and Nucleus will leave development hell and once again become a threat to PP. This season had more downs then ups so I'm hoping next season will have more ups."

Miller) asking the question: “And what about me?” What does this mean for Erlich and the rest of the Pied Piper crew? Do they remain together while trying to figure out a way to undermine the new CEO and bring Richard back into the fold? They are people who own a share of it, but they don’t have to work on it. And a new CEO would have to figure out does he or she want them involved at all? It’s one of those things, like: What exactly do you own here? There’s the algorithm and there’s the people. Sometimes companies are bought for the people involved more than the tech, and sometimes they’re bought for the tech itself. And that’s something we can explore in the new season. What’s Pied Piper? Is it worth what it’s worth because of the algorithm or because of the people? That’s a question that people have."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a3no5,frisianDew,11,Wed Jun 17 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I love this show is it's so incredibly accurate towards working in the tech industry. Even incessant details like 'Burn Down Charts', 'SWOT Analysis', all really used. Office Space (also Mike Judge, obviously) was the same way - as a QA engineer working in a tech organization; I literally am responsible for putting cover sheets on my TPS (Test Plan Summary) reports. I've have had to do numerous SWOT diagrams and I also work in Scrum, another real development method that is starting to take over.  In the same way, I think this was a nod to what can actually happen to start ups. You're desperate for money, so you pretty much take it from whomever will give it to you. But you must always be careful who you are taking from, for this reason. They buy points, then they form a board, then one buys out the other, and suddenly, these guys own a majority of your company. It happened to Steve Jobs - he was forced out in the 80s. And as we also see in the end, it can even happen to Gavin Belson.   Every big tech company has a board of shady directors that pull the strings. This is Pied Piper's jump to the real world."

Things are going awesome for the gang, then the phone rings and it's something bad. It's like plot regression to the mean.  My point is, don't bother looking for logic in whether what happened makes sense. They will find a way to explain it, probably unrealistically, but it doesn't matter. All we know for sure is that things for Richard will continue to go medium forever."

Peter Gregory made his offer with the idea that Richard would want to own and be CEO of his own company. It stands to reason that if he had lived, he would have been able to guide Richard through the business aspect of owning your own company.   Raviga under the new chick (can't remember her name) would have stepped in and done the same thing, but they abandoned him after making their offer when the lawsuit happened. All these bad decisions by Richard this past season was to retain ownership of Pied Piper and keep the business running. He had to do it without a business guide...Russ doesn't count. Raviga wouldn't have ownership in shit if he hadn't done this.  I think it is really disingenuous of Raviga to decide to remove him as CEO when had they stood with him, as Peter Gregory would have, these ""bad"" decisions would NOT have occurred. The better choice, and something Laurie should have pushed for, would be to keep him on as CEO ""under probation.""  I get this is to keep the plot going for the show...I just felt this would have been better."

She was a representative of Raviga, but I'm sure her duty was to show a unified front with Richard and Erlich to avoid Russ from controlling PP. Monica was shocked to find out what Laurie had planned to do with Richard. My first thought was ""Monica had a vote. she was the third vote!"" In reality Raviga has the last say and not Monica.

SiliconValleyHBO,3a3no5,corypwrs,2,Sat Jun 20 04:22:04 2015 UTC,"I thought that but it really depends on who owns the shares. Apparently Monica was only in the board meetings representing Raviga, which means she (Raviga) owns those shares. So that would mean that the seat belongs to Raviga, right? Can Raviga occupy multiple seats? Or does she assign people to do that? And do those people have to conform to her thoughts? Because if so, what's the difference between that and her occupying multiple seats? If not, then that means Monica gets to keep the seat and make her own decisions, right?  sorry. brain dump."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a3no5,iRaphael,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:32:11 2015 UTC,I assume this will be a significant plot point. Monica may have been appointed the board seat that raviga had initially. But then raviga dropped all funding. Thats when her boss said Monica can have the boardseat they purchased. It may actually be a unvoting seat for Monica.   Raviga wanted back in. So they baught out the other dudes investment contract. Probably for more than it was worth. He was invested in 20 million and they purchased it for 25 million or something.   So now raviga has russ' 2 seats per their contract. Monica has 1 seat from the initial raviga investment that they stopped and gave to Monica.   I hope Monica jumps ship.

Then he tells Erlich and Richard that he lost over $200mil (S2EP7). He says he has ONLY $986 million. Richard reminds Russ that he started with $1.2 billion. There's another $200 million missing based on Russ's assertion that he's worth $1.4 billion 20 years after the AOL buyout when they were eating stakes.  Russ was only going to give Pied Piper $5 mil (while he was still in the three comma club) as a structured loan. It was never mentioned what Pied Piper's valuation was (Taking Stern-Taylor's term sheet, they offered $5mil for a $25mil valuation of Pied Piper (20% stake?)). Part of the deal was that he got two board seats.   Raviga's final term sheet – $20 million at a $100 million valuation.  Raviga gave Russ enough money to put him back into the three comma club. Was Russ's two board seats worth that much? Has Pied Piper's valuation risen greatly since?  I can't see how or why Raviga would give Russ $214 million for his two board seats unless they felt Pied Piper had a valuation of, what, $1,070,000,000?!  I'm basing the $214 mill to get Russ back to $1.2 billion. They probably gave him, what, $14mil to get him back into the three comma club?  Eh...I could be wrong....."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a3no5,mb101,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:02:27 2015 UTC,stocks/shares is how much profit you get board seats is power/decision making. It's essentially the CEO boss except its made up of people who don't get paid except probably in shares they own.  Raviga gets to make the decisions but they make 5% of the profit + whatever they get for the new money they put in. They can't control shares except for the ones they own. I don't think the company owns shares of itself. They can't force people to give part of their shares to someone else.

She knows the business and is well respected at Raviga so it makes perfect sense to appoint her.

If I am not mistaken we never actually received confirmation that Richard was fired, but that we found out that he is no longer chairman of the board/CEO. Richard should still have an equity stake in PP, they would have to buy him out in order to get rid of him. When Raviga bought out Hanneman they bought his voting rights/potential equity stake, and since it was formed as a secure note (this may not be the correct term for this type of an agreement so take it in context) Richard could very easily continue to be part of PP while no longer be their CEO."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a45lu,spudge_funker,2,Wed Jun 17 08:13:42 2015 UTC,"They were necessary to make it feel like its PP VS the world instead of PP VS Hooli, There was some conflict with Russ and next season there will be conflict with Raviga and probably endframe. Also what would they do between the time Russ stopped giving them money and until the lawsuit gets solved?  I wonder what happens to Russ contract with them since he didn't fullfill it."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a16k0,azginger,6,Tue Jun 16 17:12:28 2015 UTC,What?  The show isn't actually filmed in the area?  My dreams are shattered...
SiliconValleyHBO,3a16k0,iRaqTV,3,Tue Jun 16 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"The first season, they DID film some scenes in Palo Alto - we received street closure notices for a ""HBO series by Mike Judge.""  However, since we didn't receive any additional ones, I figured all production was moved to LA. :("

SiliconValleyHBO,3a16k0,tylerpoppe,3,Tue Jun 16 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"My guess is Burbank was closest and San Fernando looked most like Downtown Palo Alto.   Blue Bottle is great, wish it was more accessible to me."

SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,cynicallad,101,Tue Jun 16 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"I was actually on a roll today, ever since I hit 100k I had slowed down but on occasion I have days where I have to post almost a few times in every thread I see, and like I said what with all the FPH shit that was going on there's a good chance I said something at the wrong time. I figured it'd have to end at some point. I made it to /r/centuryclub it was silly thinking I could go further. Probably for the better too. First account deleted, this one banned so I think it's time to just go to Voat. The best part is how they ban you without even letting you know you're fucking banned, and for why. I hate a lot of what reddit has become, and miss the old things that made it special."

SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,biggyph00l,11,Tue Jun 16 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not, but I don't support the pick and choosyness of it. Many other subs have done worse than FPH or are worse, there's /r/coontown and /r/beatingwomen2 amongst others. And to just abruptly shut everything down, no statement past the initial one. /r/all was a shit show for like two days straight and they just shut it down without even adressing it. I don't like what FPH was doing but I don't like what Reddit did either."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,ItsLSD,3,Tue Jun 16 14:03:36 2015 UTC,"The reason /r/coontown and similar subs weren't banned was because they weren't constantly harassing other users and leaking from their subs. The amount of times I saw /r/fatpeoplehate berate and make fun of strangers for no reason was astonishing. They also brogaded constantly.  e. downvoted for being right, stay classy reddit"
SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,ItsLSD,6,Tue Jun 16 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"What about /r/ShitRedditSays, they brigade and harass more than any other sub on reddit. They're not even using np.reddit.com links, just normal ones that are not supposed to be used because of brigading."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,ItsLSD,2,Tue Jun 16 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, I dunno, I've never seen them brigade much of anything, not nearly as much as SRD or SRS. I get that it happens, but they are (were) the 9th largest sub IIRC, so you're bound to get stuff that leaks just by sheer numbers alone."

SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,seeasea,129,Mon Jun 15 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The guys are all fantastic, super nice and hilarious off set also. They all go way back with each other, so there's great chemistry. I joined a bit later in season 1 ep 3. I came from a standup background like TJ & Kumail, and I've done some improv. So we hit it off right away. The scene where we all scream our names, I thought it would be fun for Jian Yang to also utter his own name, because he's confused and he sees everyone else doing it. So I just did it and it worked out, everyone laughed. That was my first day on set. And they kept me around ever since #blessed"
SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,ombx,34,Mon Jun 15 21:51:23 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the response. I love how your character in the show just sits and listens so intently and then just frustrates Ehrlich so much. Are you going to be in Seattle for stand up any time soon?

To stop the withdraws I'll be having for the next year, you should try to get all the cast members (including yourself) to do actual AMAs.

SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,ambroseburns,23,Wed Jun 17 11:21:52 2015 UTC,Hey! Love your character. Two questions: 1. Was your character always included in the creators concept of the show or did you get written in later once you were able to show them what it would be like? 2. How did you work on your broken english accent? It's perfect. (or is english a second language for you?)
SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,hcarguy,53,Mon Jun 15 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks and Great questions:   1) i believe Jian-Yang was in a very early version of a pilot I read, I don't think they shot that version. Then the character resurfaced in season 1, ep 3. I got the part. And they liked me enough to keep me around and expand the role. very happy to be part of this amazing family.   2) I am an immigrant myself, I moved to the US when I was 13. (Here's me talking about it in my standup )I don't speak with much of an accent anymore but I was Jian Yang just 10 years ago, a lost foreign kid. So I can relate to the character very much. Sometimes I listen to some Mandarin radio before I get into character."

SiliconValleyHBO,39ygqb,JeebusChrist,10,Mon Jun 15 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"Hey, just in case you get back...  What do you think Jian Yang's background meant to be? Is he a rich Chinese businessman's son, forced to live in squalor to get some experience of life in the west, a hard on his luck migrant's son, trying to study and work an internship or just putting on an accent to fuck with Bachman?   I really like the way you portray Jian Yang, and the way he seems to be the only guy who can really fuck with Bachman, especially at the charity ball, with the ""Does anyone have an extra ticket? My investor cannot pay"" delivery being bang on the money."

Just a quick question: there's been some critique of the ""ethnic humour"" in your character. I think there's a bit of that in the name Jian-Yang, but other than that I don't think there's anything which is not just about the language/cultural barriers which could be between people from any two countries. How do you feel about it yourself?     Thanks for stopping by!    EDIT: Oh shit, I see that he already left. Leaving the question up in case he comes back and just can't resist it."

Since you are answering questions, I'll ask a few:   What's Mike Judge like on set, is he very hands on? How often do the other actors fuck up their lines or burst out laughing? Are there a lot of re-takes? Is there any improvisation on the show, or is the script so tight that they don't need to? Is the incubator an actual house or just a set?"

SiliconValleyHBO,3a20q6,lillyrose2489,2,Tue Jun 16 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"parks and rec is amazing indeed! I turned to this one after parks and rec so yeah, im in need of good 20-30 minute comedy. Ill give a go to the other ones you suggest, thanks!"
SiliconValleyHBO,3a20q6,lillyrose2489,3,Tue Jun 16 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for 30 minute stuff, DEFINITELY watch 30 Rock, if you haven't already, but also there are some great newer Comedy Central shows - Broad City, Review, and Nathan for You are my favorites.  If you like British stuff (since you mention IT Crowd), Peep Show is one of my all time favorite shows.  The Inbetweeners is pretty good too (had to give it a few episodes before I really got into it).    Also, not TV shows but some of the Silicon Valley guys have podcasts or appear on podcasts a lot.  I can recommend specific ones if you're interested!"
SiliconValleyHBO,3a20q6,robindy,3,Tue Jun 16 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"yeah I cannot get enough on podcasts, I walk to work and back every day so Im up to date with the ones I like, Radiolab and a few BBC ones that are really good. Also went through Dan Carlin's Hardcore history...so yeah...anything else?   I really like British stuff, its usually very average, but when its good im literally on the floor gasping for air....Ill check out Peep show...""The Armstrong & Miller Show"" is good as well, but its hit and miss sometimes"
SiliconValleyHBO,3a20q6,liltenou,5,Tue Jun 16 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"So, just based on the fact that you like the folks in Silicon Valley, I can recommend these podcasts:    Kumail hosts the X Files Files, obviously only fun if you like that show!  It's really neat if you're a fan of it, though.  He also hosts one with his wife (who is adorable) called the Indoor Kids (it's about video games, I don't listen to it because that's not my thing but I have heard that it's great).  TJ Miller has a podcast called Cashing in with TJ Miller.  Just him and his friend Cash talking about weird stuff and telling stories.  Really funny though if you like TJ's style of comedy.  It's not my favorite but I listen to it occasionally.   improv4humans is an AWESOME improv podcast that Zach Woods is on quite often.  He always kills it.  I recommend that podcast in general but you can start by searching for his episodes if you want!  Comedy Bang Bang is just all around hilarious and has a really, really funny recent episode with Thomas Middleditch (and Lauren Lapkus, another awesome improv comedian).  Also Kumail has been on it before and it's just a great podcast if you like super goofy characters.  You Made it Weird, hosted by Pete Holmes, all about comedy, sex and god (and everything in between).  He has definitely had Kumail on twice (they're best friends, it's adorable), Thomas once (they're old, old friends who actually get into the details of why they aren't as close anymore and how sad it makes them), TJ twice (basically his other BFF besides Kumail), I think Martin Starr did an episode as well.  Holding out for him to get Zach Woods!     Those podcasts are mostly on the Nerdist network (I also like the Nerdist podcast a lot, they've definitely had a lot of the Silicon Valley folks on) or Earwolf (Never Not Funny is also a good one on that network and Kumail and TJ were both recent guests!).  Both of those networks have a lot of hilarious stuff that is totally worth checking out.    Oh, one more!  Not a small podcast but WTF with Marc Maron can be great even if Marc can be kind of a dick.  He recently had Zach Woods on!  It was a really entertaining interview.  Zach doesn't go on a lot of podcasts so it was fun to see him pop up."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a113u,darknessgp,4,Tue Jun 16 22:16:29 2015 UTC,"I noticed many of the references as well, and when it didn't happen, I could tell it was definitely a red herring. The setup was just a little too perfect for it to really happen."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a113u,lillyrose2489,3,Tue Jun 16 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"I thought the exact same thing and I think it was probably a deliberate misdirect. I was 100% sure that they would just make it look like the house burned down.  Maybe they ended up going with using a code to try to destroy it because that's probably a more logical thing for guys like that to do. A fire is pretty dramatic and would have destroyed ALL of their stuff, not just Pied Piper, so it would be a bit dramatic."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a113u,kestrel42,2,Tue Jun 16 17:39:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they would have deliberately set it on fire - rather, the fire that started from them overloading the servers would have either gone out of control, or restarted by freak coincidence when they left to get lemons.  That's pretty much exactly the ridiculous way events always play out in this show. More believable than Richard kicking his keys down the gutter."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a113u,jwcobb13,3,Tue Jun 16 22:18:51 2015 UTC,I thought they destroy the place sell and end up moving into another incubator especially since the guy next door was moving so Donald doesn't have anywhere to sleep again?

They tend to not be folks like Erlich with a smallish exit from their own startup, but rather an early FB/Google employee with a big exit. They find themselves in their 20s with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and a need to prove that they weren't just lucky.   Having started my own company and sold it for single digit millions, I understand that luck and talent are both important. However my partner was a normal Facebook engineer for a couple of years starting in 2010 and ended up with $4M. Lots of people in that cohort, and many of them are insecure.

She has a minority stake as well; but, it's very small. (Her salary investment is paltry compared to Reviga's initial investment.) So buying out Russ' shares, Reviga has 3 seats.   Don't know the wording of Reviga's contract with Pied Piper or Pied Piper's corporate structure. It is possible that Monica could be replaced on the board if Reviga chooses to do so."
SiliconValleyHBO,3a24sf,EchelonHD,3,Tue Jun 16 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"I understand how the board breaks down with Reviga gaining Russ' positions and how that gives them a majority of board votes. What I don't understand is how Richard, with majority shares in the company, can be voted out.  The only thing I can work out is that the capital owners effectively voted on how many board slots there would be with their various funding contracts. But couldn't the board be reorganized with another shareholder vote, effectively allowing Richard to re-stack the board back in his favor? Why does Richard, as the majority shareholder, have so few board seats? Is this all an artifact of how the funding contracts were structured and they're just stuck with it now? Is it not possible to restructure the board of directors?  Obviously, I have no idea how C-level and board politics actually work with respect to capital shares..."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a24sf,pic2022,5,Tue Jun 16 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if this is going to come back in Season 3:  If you think back to S2E1, Richard and Laurie come to the agreement that Richard will only accept the lower Raviga offer he wants if ""Monica votes Raviga's board seat"" to which Laurie replies ""Well, certainly that seems unimportant.""  The fact that Raviga later pulls its offer off the table doesn't change this agreement.  They could either spin this later as Monica now voting all 3 Raviga seats, or at the very least, have her side with Richard, allowing the team to retain the majority vote as long as Monica is on their side, and make the claim that the last vote was held without her input, and therefore, doesn't count."

SiliconValleyHBO,3a24sf,Sunsparc,6,Tue Jun 16 19:04:22 2015 UTC,This is an important distinction. Richard was fired as CEO but for them to pull him from the board would mean buying out whatever stake he has.
SiliconValleyHBO,3a24sf,TrulyExcellent,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"Richard still owns shares, and is still employee of the company. He simply is not CEO anymore, which I think is the most logical solution, as he is not really cut out for it."

SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,Oddgenetix,112,Mon Jun 15 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"That was great.  Love the irony that if Gavin actually offered Richard 10 million and he took it, then Gavin would have been better off."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,cocopupu,35,Mon Jun 15 21:08:35 2015 UTC,I thought they would have made more of the fact that Gavin just valued Pied Piper at a quarter of a billion dollars.
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,GayFesh,13,Mon Jun 15 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"I think they sort of explained it by having Gavin say that it's the only thing that would make Nucleus work. I'm willing to bet a working version of Nucleus is worth 250M to them, given how much they've hyped it up."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,falabala,5,Tue Jun 16 01:59:27 2015 UTC,Isn't this kind of low actually? Considering how much big tech firms are paying for acquisitions at the moment and that Hooli (so basically Google) announced Nucleus as one of their main project you would think it could be worth a billion or more.
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,whitepalms85,19,Tue Jun 16 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"Not likely as the judge dude still would have seen the employment contract issue. He even commented how if Gavin never pursued the Jared employment suit, then he wouldn't have seen it, but because he did, it couldn't be avoided. He might have been able to settle and get PP but he still might lose like half of his employees."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,azginger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Richard would have already agreed to sell for 10M regardless. The whole process would have stopped.  I'm not a lawyer, though, so you might be right about Gavin losing half his employees. I'm not sure if the judge is bound to report the illegality of the employment contract that he discovered, since it has no bearing on the settlement."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,falabala,6,Tue Jun 16 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"Unless he whipped out a contract right then and there that Richard signed agreeing to sell it for 10 mil, it wouldn't have mattered if he ""agreed""."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,Soulcrux,9,Tue Jun 16 10:52:28 2015 UTC,Unfortunately for Richard being Richard it would have mattered :-/
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,LePotatoEspeciale,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:04:26 2015 UTC,"Signed agreement, obvs."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,falabala,3,Tue Jun 16 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of wrong legal stuff in this show  but i'll tell you this :  the show was super off in how that gets handled.  Invalid non compete agreements in contracts just have those particular clauses invalidated, they don't negate employment agreements.  Not to mention even if the contract was invalidated as a whole there would still be common law working relationship.  So yeah."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,Pennoyer_v_Neff,-2,Wed Jun 17 01:26:24 2015 UTC,If Richard signed a separate contract before the ruling signing over any rights he had to Pied Piper for $10 million the judge's ruling would have been irrelevant.
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,Jeff3412,-2,Tue Jun 16 01:58:28 2015 UTC,"No, it would settle the intellectual property suit. He'd still rule on the contract. It's just like how Gavin tried tl drop the Jared employment suit and the judge said it's too late since the contact legality has already been brought forth. If you're doing something illegal, it doesn't just get brushed under the table because you let the issue go."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,azginger,3,Tue Jun 16 02:44:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, the judge would not issue any ruling because once Richard agreed to sell, even a disbarred lawyer would stay the proceedings, the two sides would enter into a settlement agreement, and the judge would never issue a ruling on any of the allegations. The allegations regarding Jared's employment contract would be dropped as part of the settlement agreement."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,excusado,0,Tue Jun 16 12:42:12 2015 UTC,"If you're doing something illegal, it doesn't just get brushed under the table because you let the issue go.   Actually if Richard's employment contract was different than Jared's and completely legal then that's exactly what would have happened with Jared's illegal contract. I guess Jared could try to sue for damages, but he broke the contract anyway.  Richard didn't win because Hooli was doing just any random thing that was illegal. He won specifically because the judge ruled his employment contract was void and so it could not give Hooli any rights to Richard's IP, but voiding that contract doesn't void other contracts richard made to sell his IP. Otherwise Richard would own a 100 percent of Pied Piper right now, but he doesn't."

SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,_up_,21,Tue Jun 16 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"Here's Season 3 for you.   Bighead becomes CEO of Hooli Raviga puts Gavin in as PP CEO Richard mopes around for a while, knowing he owns a huge chunk of a company that he can't actually do anything with Hooli, at Bighead's nudging (and probably Erlich working him behind the scenes) buys PP for a ridiculous amount of money Richard becomes, well, rich, but agrees to get on board the Hooli train as long as he becomes head of Hooli.xyz and can port over the old PP team Gavin Belsom, having literally nothing else in his life, goes to work for Richard as his #2 Hooli crashes and burns around Bighead, and it's up to Hooli.xyz to keep the company propped up"

The rest of the guy's antipathy toward Hooli was pretty clear the last time it was brought up that Hooli might buy PP. Maybe Dinesh would be more open to it, seeing that his app was crap, but Jared wouldn't want to go back there, and Gilfoyle can work on his own stuff.

SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,BalefireX,6,Tue Jun 16 14:03:29 2015 UTC,"He still owns the company.  Richard still owns the IP of the algorithm, and Pied Piper is still in Richard's name as the owner.  He just doesn't run the company anymore.  He could never talk to any of them again, and he would still make bank in the long run.  But that is not why Richard is doing any of this."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,VenomOnKiller,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:33:59 2015 UTC,"The Company owns the IP, not Richard. And if he agreed to vesting like his friend that lost everything because he asked not ""for less"". He could also have lost everything! But of course he is not fired that would be stupid."
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,_up_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I can see that point that the algorithm is really belongs to Pied Piper. Richard still owns likes 75% of Pied Piper, but since he can't take that algorithm and make a new start up with it, it will always stay with PP if Richard sold his 75% stake.  Is that the right way to look at it?"
SiliconValleyHBO,39ycl8,VenomOnKiller,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"In real life for founders like Richard if he was smart enough, which so far a lot indicates that he isn't..., there are acceleration clauses to vesting. The typical founder acceleration clause would be double trigger which means if the company is sold, acquired, liquidated, etc., he would get all his shares vested. The second trigger is if he is fired without cause, which in most vesting contracts for cause would be defined as committing a felony or other real serious violations. Most definitely Richard wasn't fired for cause from what was shown. (Although if the board found out that Richard ordered his team to delete everything that would definitely be for cause as that is highly illegal. Ignoring that part they don't have any other for cause issues.)"

Why was she interested in Jian-Yang's stupid app?  Why did him smoking kill the entire investment if she's supposed to be so logical?  Why does she treat Monica like shit when Monica is the only employee of value shown at the company?  The dumbest thing she did was dropping Pied Piper because of a baseless lawsuit.  Hooli never had a shot until they lucked out at the last minute."
SiliconValleyHBO,39zkb9,woopthat,16,Tue Jun 16 07:23:05 2015 UTC,"With the smoking, I think the point was that silicon valley culture is really emotional when it comes to smoking.  So even someone as hardline logical as Monica's boss is overtaken with the hate of smoking."
SiliconValleyHBO,39zkb9,matafubar,5,Tue Jun 16 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"On your first point about the app, it's because she held an anti-smoking meeting the day before and Erlich appealed to her emotions (supporting what she said to Monica the day before).   The second point we don't know if Monica is the only employee of value. She's the only one we see but we don't know if there are other people at Raviga doing investments.   The 3rd point is spot on. She says that everything other than the software was a result of human error but mostly her's.

Otherwise Richard would still be in charge. I also think Monica would prefer Bighead to an outsider. Essentially he'd be a figurehead with Richard running the company from the chief technology officer's office.   But most likely a new character   I agree, this is probably correct."
SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,_up_,5,Mon Jun 15 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"But what would Gavin do. He is to good to be written of. And after the tie scene, he would be so perfect to teach Richard how it is done."
SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,skulman7,5,Tue Jun 16 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"Richard doesn't want to become Gavin, but as Gavin said to Richard, Richard's best-case scenario would be to become him.  Gavin is super smart and obviously knows business.  His ego was his biggest downfall.  Would definitely bring an interesting dynamic and keep him as a villain while Richard tries to retake his role of CEO. . But as stated in my previous post, it will most likely be someone completely knew.  I hope they find ways to keep Gavin and Pete Monahan in the series one way or the other."
SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,cocopupu,10,Tue Jun 16 20:15:29 2015 UTC,Another comment I saw speculated he would replace Gavin at Hooli and then buy Pied Piper to restore it to Richard.

SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,Random_Tangent,6,Tue Jun 16 19:58:20 2015 UTC,That wouldn't make sense... Bighead doesn't do anything (literally) so if he becomes CEO it would be like nothing had changed.
SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,mattscott53,5,Mon Jun 15 22:44:36 2015 UTC,Right. CEO Bighead can still do nothing. Richard can run the company from behind the scenes without having to deal with the investors.   It's practically perfect (and also why it probably won't happen).
SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,silentbill86,7,Mon Jun 15 22:55:45 2015 UTC,Big Head's replacing Gavin and he's going to hire Richard to be his number two guy. Raviga will hire the disgraced Gavin to oversee Pied Piper.

SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,emkat,3,Tue Jun 16 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"I concluded the same thing. Most likely, Hooli will get out of the compression business and the story will shift to endframe being the adversarial force.

SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,iaglia,7,Tue Jun 16 02:00:52 2015 UTC,why they voted him out of CEO?   (In universe answer) They want to protect their multimillion dollar investment. They see Richard as a poor decision maker.  (Actual answer) Drama.   couldnt hold another position like president or something   I suspect he'll still be actively involved in the company. He also still owns most of it and has a board seat.
SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,PM_ME_YOUR_BLOODTYPE,3,Tue Jun 16 02:29:52 2015 UTC,"On the website he is just greyed out but Erich is listed as a board member. So if he has a board seat, why isn't he listed as a board member?"
SiliconValleyHBO,39yaw4,steam_donkey,4,Tue Jun 16 02:41:00 2015 UTC,Maybe it is supposed to represent a temporary fix? Like the website admin just got the news that Richard was 'canned' on a Sunday night and had to make a quick update?   There is no mention in the show that Richard lost his board seat. I don't really see how they could take that from him.

Jobs went on to found NeXT producing the NeXTcube which ran on the new NeXTSTEP OS. These systems were very advanced for the era, in fact Tim Berners-Lee used one as the very first web server.   Whilst all of this was happening the Macintosh's architecture was becoming outdated and progress was slowing at Apple. Apple then acquired NeXT, reabsorbing Jobs in the process. This allowed Apple to adapt the NeXT OS for their own systems. A few months later Jobs's control of Apple was reinstated.  tl;dr: The history of UNIX operating systems is very interesting."

Every character got a chance to shine, every character got his/her due. The ending was both inevitable and unexpected. Plus, it’s what happens to startup after startup. Not the end of the world, though, just a cliffhanger. Laurie Bream will be a great antagonist in Season 3. And, except for Monica’s dawning horror at what she’s done, just about every scene was funny.  Sure, it’s harsh, but not sacrificing your daughter in a futile attempt to take a muddy burntout shell of a castle harsh."

SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,ohyeah_mamaman,12,Mon Jun 15 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe people need to quit acting like Richard is literally losing everything and going out on the streets. He's not CEO anymore but still owns a major stake in the company, as well as a board seat. They won the lawsuit, popularized Pied Piper, and got the main antagonist sacked from his own company. There are so many ways this could go from here (Gavin becoming PP CEO, Richard staying on as CTO before becoming CEO again, Bighead being CEO of either Pied Piper or Hooli).   People are just too invested in seeing this comedy as a drama. Honestly there were only two major moments where things seemed utterly hopeless: when Gavin had Richard cornered with the lawsuit, and just after they lost the deal with Intersite over the file deletions; everything else was hilarious and even those stressful moments were resolved in the next episode. I mean for God's sake, people were getting worked up and stressed out over the scene where he's trying to stop the deletions after the lawsuit is resolved, like what? I mean it was a freakout when they won and he realized he had to stop it, but once the delays over clicking the delete key started it should have been hilariously and painfully obvious that the deletion wasn't going to happen.  This show has places left to go, and conflict is inherent. If your heart palpitates every time it comes up and you can't handle it without constant assurances multiple times an episode that everything is gonna be ok, maybe go find a network comedy instead, higher chance of finding something with little to no actual conflict and happy endings every time."

I feel I'd be so much happier with the show if they just gave us a real win this episode, more inclined to spread the word and such. Now I feel like I'd have to say it with a warning, if I said anything at all, like GoT."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,breathethisair,14,Mon Jun 15 04:15:10 2015 UTC,"I enjoy it because it's such a change of pace from entertainment convincing me that everything's going to be okay. It isn't, and the happy ending for protagonists is getting a little predictable now -- you see this in threads: ""I was waiting for so-and-so to show up and save everything!"" or ""there's no way they'll hurt so-and-so, he's the protagonist,"" or ""I knew it wouldn't happen, the writers aren't that bold."" Honestly, Silicon Valley thus far has been a fairly accurate depiction of the industry, and I've seen my share of people hit rock bottom hard at the helm of their startup, as Richard almost did (more than once).  Life isn't easy, and entertainment is starting to reflect this more. I like it, personally.  The turnaround in this episode in the lawsuit actually started walking back that way, and I got a bit scared, like it was going to end on a happy, unrealistic note. I was glad another shoe dropped, because if the screen cut to black on everybody celebrating, what the hell do I have to look forward to in Season 3? Buying out a board seat is a common play, too, and the composition of Pied Piper's board sat in the back of my head like a thorn all season -- Richard really needed more of his people there, and it's his inexperience that came back to bite him. That happens a lot."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,Mortusa,5,Mon Jun 15 08:34:07 2015 UTC,"Basically my big complaint is that they felt the need to end the season on the cliffhanger, rather than just giving us a chance to breathe and enjoy the show. Are you seriously saying if things ended pleasantly you'd be hesitant about the next season? You know full well that something bad would come up next season, I don't think we needed to see it now to be sure it was going to happen.   It's nice to give us the realism and struggles, but it was entirely unnecessary to end a season with such disappointment. As I said in another comment, now I'll have a hard time enjoying a rewatch, and I'm not so sure I'll be recommending the show on social media or in real life. In the same way that I don't really recommend GOT to anyone because it feels like I'm giving them something good and bad. I doubt I'll really want to discuss it with anyone either, I'd rather just forget about it til next season."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,nina00i,3,Mon Jun 15 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"I got a bit scared, like it was going to end on a happy, unrealistic note.   What sort of logic is that? How does happy = unrealistic? It's fine to include some tragedy in a story but the crux should always be a positive note. You go through the troughs because you know the peak lies ahead of you. If I just wanted misery, I'd go on vacation to a Syrian refugee camp. I watch TV to escape from that bullshit, not get more of it. /rant"
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,Holovoid,2,Mon Jun 15 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"Then go watch a fucking network sitcom or something.    This show is the antithesis of a show like Entourage where everything works out in the end. Why bother watching if you know it's just going to have a pretty bow on top of it? The point of conflict in story telling is to keep you interested and to keep you wanting to know what's happening next to the characters and this is good for the longevity of the show.  I thought the finale was brilliantly written. I was actually on the edge of my seat during the entire sequence of the traffic spike, the courtroom, and the rush to beat the formatting of the hard drive. It was thrilling and very funny. Conflict builds characters because of how they deal with the conflict. Without it you have very hollow and boring characters, ala Entourage.  I think we all know that when the series ends, it will end on a positive note because the characters are too like-able and central to the show for them to just get fucked over. But in the mean time, you can't build to the pay off without the tension."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,bananaramallamasama,2,Mon Jun 15 23:22:27 2015 UTC,"I thought this season was borderline bad. Too many things go wrong.

SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,WestonP,2,Mon Jun 15 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"It's because now D&D are using less and less source material because GRRM can't be bothered to finish the books. More original stuff from the show runners means more crap, unsatisfying reductions of plot points, exaggerated violence, no really good fighting scenes whatsoever aside from Night's watch fighting wights north of the wall, and even then the editing gave me a headache (though the animation was top notch). Not even book readers know what's going to happen to Jon, what happens to Stannis, etc. That's the point we're at now. Maybe GRRM planned it this way since his next book is coming out later this year apparently, so that books wouldn't spoil the series years in advance, but I think it's more likely he just doesn't want to write!"

SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,Namkcalb,-1,Mon Jun 15 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Fuck you writers.  Season 1 was brilliant. Of course that can't be the end of the story, but they had SO many other directions they could have gone. Ones that could have been funnier and more fun to watch. PP gets shit on for the ENTIRE duration of Season 2, all for a let down ending. It didn't create drama like a good negative ending should. I don't care about season 3 anymore. I'm fucking pissed they gave the viewer zero payoff for investing their time with their story. The only reason I kept eagerly tuning in is because the show is so well casted and when the jokes are funny.. they're really funny."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,BigGreekMike,13,Mon Jun 15 04:22:16 2015 UTC,"Let down?  They won the suit, their algorhithm exploded in popularity and one of their two competitors pretty much collapsed.  Bighead became CEO... wait are you thinking what I'm thinking... Big Head recruits Richard"
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,InvestInDong,0,Mon Jun 15 08:44:07 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have mattered if that's the direction they wanted to setup season 3 for, which honestly.. is so blatantly obvious to the viewer I almost hope that's not what happens.   The problem is that Mike J. and his team make it such that PP's successes are incredibly short lived. It becomes exhausting to watch. If they had saved the CEO board boot for S03E01 I think it would have worked out much better and the viewers would have been ready for the long wait. Leaving Bighetti as the cliff hanger would have been much better. It would have left people speculating that they would turn against each other, and then S03 starts and it gets turned on it's head. Now the viewer knows exactly where they're going, and the payoff of beating Gavin/Hooli feels weak.  I guess this is just the way this show is going to go, though. People will stick around for the jokes but the writers will train the audience to know that successes are immediately followed by kicks in the nuts. It becomes predictable. Last night watching it I held my breath knowing that with a few minutes left SOMETHING was coming that was going to take away that warm feeling. That piss drinking server scene was GREAT. I wish they let us savor that for more than 1minute. The piss that is."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,TortugaChris,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it could have waited 'til next year. It felt natural to close the Russ Hannerman arc and his voting rights were a big part of it that needed to be dealt with. I admit they shouldn't have ended so abruptly after that scene. Maybe having Richard immediately get to work making middle out even better, it was a theme since S1E1 that Richard is far more confident in his tech ability than his business acumen."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,therukus,0,Mon Jun 15 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"If they wanted to force Richard out, they should have just had him kicked out in the first episode. Feels like a wasted season."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,BigGreekMike,12,Mon Jun 15 04:26:48 2015 UTC,"Richard isn't CEO, he didn't lose everything.  He's still the majority shareholder, a board member, and the guy who created the PP.  If you think next season will just be Richard being forced out onto the streets I'm sure you'll be disappointed.  I'd expect the start of next season will consist of Richard trying to regain some form of control over PP, even if not as the CEO."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,cocopupu,5,Mon Jun 15 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking now that Raviga Capital owns Pied Piper and wants to take them in a different direction, the company will flourish. They had a good point that the company will be revolutionary and is being wasted on video streaming. Gavin Belsen is out a job now and may just be the new CEO of Pied Piper. Meanwhile, Richard will learn from his past mistakes, much like Steve Jobs when ousted from Apple, while still working at Pied Piper alongside Gavin Belsen. Eventually, in the season finale, Richard will regain control of his company from Raviga Capital and Gavin and use his newfound knowledge from Season 3 to better himself and his company that just exploded in popularity thanks to its ""new direction"" away from just video streaming. Of course, then a new conflict will present itself for season 4."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,furryoverlord,3,Mon Jun 15 11:04:12 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking now that Raviga Capital owns Pied Piper and wants to take them in a different direction, the company will flourish.    Definitely not agreeing with you here. The way the Rav CEO was saying how they were focused on video and that being a waste made it obvious that they'll become the enemy. They'll want to take it in a direction the PP boys (hah) don't want to go. Bighetti will rise to power at Hooli and try to buyout PP."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,TheBestAtWriting,2,Mon Jun 15 15:37:59 2015 UTC,"I want less of Richard not more. He's by far the worst character on the show. Worked way better season 1 when he wasn't the protagonist, just a protagonist. I'm hoping next season is more Erlich-centered."

SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,cabose7,2,Tue Jun 16 02:51:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sick of people arguing that misfortune is ""good writing.""  Sometimes creating a harsh, realistic world for your characters adds intrigue. It also serves to make their small victories more satisfying. However, it's not ""bad writing"" to let them win every once in awhile. We watch these shows for their entertainment value. And I think it's important to remember that watching a television show is a much bigger investment of your time than a movie or even a book. For weeks on end now, HBO viewers' Sunday nights have been an hour and a half of being upset. Is it really so unreasonable to want something uplifting? If the characters are well written then you're going to empathize with them, so why do I have ""poor taste"" for saying that I don't like coming away from the majority of Silicon Valley or GOT episodes feeling shitty?   Last season of Silicon Valley was a perfect balance of peaks and valleys. They went through shit, but when they pulled through at the end it was so worth it and made the us feel great. This season's finale set up an interesting plot arc, but I don't think they had to drop that on us for the sake of having a depressing cliffhanger. They could have ended on a high note and held off on firing Richard until next season's premiere. They could still have hinted at it for the sake of continuity but why go and ruin the moment?  Say what you will, but I think there's nothing wrong with wanting my entertainment to be a little less depressing."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,SelfMadeSoul,4,Mon Jun 15 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"They're not real people and everything is going to be OK in the end. This is a serialized show and it's the middle of the story. The middle of the story is generally when the adversity against the hero is the greatest. Here, read this: http://www.movieoutline.com/articles/the-hero-journey-mythic-structure-of-joseph-campbell-monomyth.html. See the chart in the middle? The show's at the ordeal step. This is fundamental stuff, and it's been the general structure of every story you've ever seen/read/heard, it's just that having it as a multi-season tv show tends to drag it out a bit. But trust me, it's following a familiar path, you'll get your payoff eventually. So quit flipping out."
SiliconValleyHBO,39vdgv,Connguy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"I'm farmiliar with that standard plot structure but I still take issue with the writing. I would have been fine with this ending if the rest of the season hadn't beaten us over the head with Pied Piper's misfortune. Like I said, the story arc they're setting up is interesting, I take no issue with it in itself. I understand that there's a need for conflict, and I'm not saying it should be all flowers and sunshine. But I think they could stand to tone things down because many audience members (clearly not just myself if you look on the subreddits, fb, and reviews) don't want to come away from their entertainment feeling like shit on a regular basis. You need to feel as though the cost of investing yourself in something that makes you feel upset from time to time is worthwhile.  I'm not saying that this sort of writing is wholly useless or serves zero purpose, but I do feel it reaches a point of diminishing returns wherein it discourages the audience from further investing themselves in the show."

SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,vreddy92,373,Mon Jun 15 04:45:35 2015 UTC,For a show that's supposed to be a comedy it's way too emotionally draining.   After every episode in Season 1 I was always happy and laughing. Now I'm just always mad.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Spoonska,191,Mon Jun 15 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed that they won the lawsuit and all that. I enjoyed Hooli's downfall. However, the whole ""I need to call them and get them to not delete it"" thing was just stressful, and it seems like they were trying for humor. Especially since it ended so anticlimactically."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,azginger,206,Mon Jun 15 02:34:02 2015 UTC,To me it really felt like that whole 10 minutes of the show was self aware. Almost like it knew about the criticism of the show having such crazy peaks and valleys.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Stryker88,116,Mon Jun 15 03:16:12 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing when he kicked his keys.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,mrbrambles,48,Mon Jun 15 03:22:03 2015 UTC,"Of course it was. I have no idea how someone could think otherwise. I mean, at one point they were climbing a lemon tree to get a bruise-free lemon for the beer that they were drinking to toast to the end of PP."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,danbrag,86,Mon Jun 15 05:12:58 2015 UTC,it was intentionally outrageous I think.  didnt mean that it wasnt brutal to watch haha.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,BlueFalcon89,73,Mon Jun 15 05:57:49 2015 UTC,"Don't even say ""you think"". They just parodied the fuck out of that scene. Each distraction was just a joke haha and they fully understood it. I think they're reminding us that this is a comedy and people should chill"
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Bensas42,52,Mon Jun 15 04:03:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly, picking lemons for their wheat beer that end up not being good enough so they go back?  It was a purposeful schtick."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,notRedditingInClass,11,Mon Jun 15 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"""This one has kind of a bruise here"""
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,I_cant_speel,10,Mon Jun 15 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"That was absolutely, definitely intentional. If you didn't laugh when they cut to the gang getting lemons (twice), I'm afraid the humor went over your head. It was simultaneously hilarious, dramatic, and brilliant."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,4-bit,305,Mon Jun 15 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"""What about me?"" was so damn funny but I couldn't even laugh after what just happened."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,thurgood231,84,Mon Jun 15 05:54:13 2015 UTC,"I think that's the twist for next season.  We're meant to think of it about him thinking for himself, but really he's going to go in there, say something epic, then drop his balls on the table and get Richard back in."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Jayhawk11,11,Mon Jun 15 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"That's what I think will happen too. That, and then hopefully baghead will end up the head of hooli and buying pied piper."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,slinky317,378,Mon Jun 15 04:23:31 2015 UTC,"What the fuck, you can't fire Richard"
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,MakeCoolThings,658,Mon Jun 15 06:22:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he is really bad at running the company. He can make the software, but he can't make business decisions and when he tries he actually makes horrible decisions for the company all the time. He'd be a better CTO instead of a CEO."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Risaga54,243,Mon Jun 15 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"He also originally developed his amazing compression (albeit different from middle-out) as a means to an end for a music searching app. He's great at developing technology, not so great at long term business vision."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,amirage2000,108,Mon Jun 15 02:41:35 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll make him CTO?   Actually I've been wondering all series if Monica will ever quit Raviga and start working for Pied Piper...
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Fattswindstorm,59,Mon Jun 15 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"If Richard becomes the CTO, then both Dinesh and Gilfoyle will be demoted."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,BaxterInwood,42,Mon Jun 15 04:06:20 2015 UTC,Co-vice CTO
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,JendoShabo,39,Mon Jun 15 11:58:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, you just described Microsoft."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,valakut_,26,Mon Jun 15 16:09:16 2015 UTC,Not since Satya Nadella took over.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,magicfatkid,42,Mon Jun 15 04:11:37 2015 UTC,I think this is supposed to mirror when Steve Jobs got fired from Apple (even though Erlich is supposed to be the Jobs persona on the show).
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,UnfortunateEmotions,160,Mon Jun 15 05:44:26 2015 UTC,He still has major ownership stakes I presume.  Niggas gettin paid.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,rjkeats,141,Mon Jun 15 04:17:23 2015 UTC,"All he has is partial ownership in the company now- he still has his board seat and voting powers but no longer has CEO control. Plus, Ruviga's three votes means that his vote is essentially useless."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,LolitsPing,108,Mon Jun 15 02:35:30 2015 UTC,"Does Monica have to vote with Ruviga?  Didn't she invest her own money in Pied Piper, hence she can vote as she sees fit?"
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,dewhashish,70,Mon Jun 15 02:43:04 2015 UTC,They'll prolly fire her from raviga and her investment comes from her salary
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,HFABamaFan,62,Mon Jun 15 03:02:49 2015 UTC,isnt that a conflict of interest?
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,KingOfDaCastle,20,Mon Jun 15 03:07:51 2015 UTC,Don't all board members have to be present? I thought that had to happen in a board meeting.   Gavin Belson could come in as the new CEO.  Edit: intoxicated grammar
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,vreddy92,35,Mon Jun 15 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"Generally, no. You would need a quorum, which may be a simple majority (3/5). It would really depends on how the company was set it up though."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,kcc989,49,Mon Jun 15 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"She doesn't have a seat on the board of directors. Raviga has three of those (Although technically Monica sits for Raviga's share). Anyway, I doubt Monica would vote against Raviga."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,KingOfDaCastle,21,Mon Jun 15 04:21:29 2015 UTC,"I think that would make the whole ""Monica voting for Reviga"" bit pointless. Her voting the original Riviga board seat has to be an important plot point"
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,CanYouDigItHombre,45,Mon Jun 15 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"I do wonder what the Cap table looks like. Erlich has 10% which he reminds us constantly (he must have avoided dilution somehow). What did Russ get? I can't remember Raviga's original terms either, but for some reason think like 5%? Assuming an employee pool of 15%, Richard should still hold 50%+ of the company. As the majority owner, he should be able to change the composition of the board I would think. But then again, this show makes it hard to suspend disbelief."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,michael1026,12,Mon Jun 15 03:44:20 2015 UTC,Russ gave them a loan and possible got some shares or interest. In the loan deal he 100% got two board seats. One for him and another for his GF (who doesn't speak english and votes his way)
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,magicfatkid,41,Mon Jun 15 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, when Gavin offered to give him $10m he seemed pretty happy. It's pretty much the same deal. He sits back and received piles of cash for doing nothing."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Tarijeno,61,Mon Jun 15 04:58:42 2015 UTC,So he's the new Baghead?
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,kukukele,100,Mon Jun 15 02:43:11 2015 UTC,"I would actually really enjoy seeing an episode where Richard tries, but fails, to relax. He seems like the kind of guy who could have a panic attack sitting on a beach."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Someguy2020,26,Mon Jun 15 02:52:11 2015 UTC,The Matt Flynn of Silicon Valley
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,ihateconnecticut,25,Mon Jun 15 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"They can, but they won't.  Moving a founder out of the CEO role when investors don't think he/she is ready isn't uncommon. With the right person taking over and giving them the business leadership could actually be a great direction. Richard still has a lot to learn.  Larry Page had to step aside and it worked out well.  Jobs got forced out and it was a disaster afterwards, but he came back much more ready to lead."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,MakeCoolThings,106,Mon Jun 15 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"Remember, Monica owns a seat, Richard and Erlich do.   Riviga technically only has 2 seats as Monica was given one. That was a condition.  She's gonna turn on Riviga, 3v2 and it's all over. Monica just needs to be like OJ and think about the magic over money!"
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,vreddy92,124,Mon Jun 15 04:45:13 2015 UTC,"I thought Monica had just been acting as the board member from Raviga? I think she can be replaced if that is the case by anyone from Raviga.  Edit: Yes she invested her own money in the company. But in season 1 the BOD was Erlich, Richard, and Peter. Monica only acted as the Raviga BOD member when Peter was no longer in the picture and, unless someone knows otherwise, does not have her own personal seat on the board."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Dark_Shroud,29,Mon Jun 15 02:43:50 2015 UTC,"But Richard requested that that be in the contract. So at the very least, Monica has one seat where she represents Raviga. The fact that the board met kinda makes me think that it's a done deal though."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,raddits,23,Mon Jun 15 02:55:58 2015 UTC,"Richard requested that she take over, but they never signed a new contract. So Monica had to cave to her boss or loss the sear and possibly her job over all."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,InMotion31,26,Mon Jun 15 03:12:31 2015 UTC,Then why did she vote him out at the emergency meeting
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Social-Justice-Druid,301,Mon Jun 15 03:21:18 2015 UTC,"""Justice, baby.""  edit: oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck  edit #2: AND BIN LADEN WITH THE SAVE  edit #3: motherFUCK!"
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,BlueFalcon89,131,Mon Jun 15 02:45:51 2015 UTC,Gilfoyle's finally having an 'Oh Shit' reaction.  Love it.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,SomewhereDownInTexas,261,Mon Jun 15 02:21:13 2015 UTC,So happy everything is going well on one HBO show.    Edit: I spoke too soon
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Yaeger21,32,Mon Jun 15 02:10:57 2015 UTC,Only for this one episode lol.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,wannaknowmyname,163,Mon Jun 15 02:28:31 2015 UTC,WTF! THATS HOW YOU END THE SEASON?
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,CaptainRosewood,157,Mon Jun 15 02:28:50 2015 UTC,With Pusha T? Damn right
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,wannaknowmyname,28,Mon Jun 15 02:32:23 2015 UTC,Fuck yea I turned up my TV when I heard Changing of the Guards lol. King Push forever.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,grantishere,24,Mon Jun 15 04:21:41 2015 UTC,I get excited at the credits in anticipation for awesome hip hop. YEEUUGH
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,purifico,49,Mon Jun 15 04:40:09 2015 UTC,Wow Gavin just keeps surprising me on how much he can be an asshole
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,aaabbcd,24,Mon Jun 15 05:18:21 2015 UTC,"I still like him, I don't know why."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,MakeCoolThings,22,Mon Jun 15 02:14:45 2015 UTC,Because Matt Ross is a good actor.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,famousceleb,48,Mon Jun 15 10:57:02 2015 UTC,Scroll to the Who We Are section.... :(
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,PM_Poutine,89,Mon Jun 15 18:11:10 2015 UTC,Every piece of IP developed at Hooli by an invalid contracted employee is now owned by that employee and not Hooli.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,ihadaquestion,154,Mon Jun 15 02:54:23 2015 UTC,So Baghead owns a potato cannon.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,B11111,27,Mon Jun 15 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"Very few IP's at Hooli (if any) are developed by a single person though, a team of employees, sure. That team would need to agree to just leave Hooli and take the rights with them."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,cryptdemon,22,Mon Jun 15 10:20:59 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so.  Besides the fact that an arbtiration doesn't carry those kind of precedent setting powers, the scope of the question was about the ownership of the IP under the contract.  The contract was then considered unenforceable, making such a decision moot.  It doesn't say whether other contacts are or aren't enforceable."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,JKaye57,11,Mon Jun 15 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"The big difference is that Richard did it while not on the clock.  If you get paid to do work on something (which every Hooli employee did), there's no court that wouldn't side with it being Hooli's IP."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,smackavelli,82,Mon Jun 15 06:44:59 2015 UTC,Bighead running Hooli...that'd be amazing.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,ItsPrisonTime,41,Mon Jun 15 13:53:34 2015 UTC,Thank Satan for Dinesh's poor skills
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Badgerisbest,16,Mon Jun 15 02:26:48 2015 UTC,"No, it's the fucking damn HARDWARE'S fault...."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,mikehah,425,Mon Jun 15 02:26:21 2015 UTC,I love this shows humor in every episode but the plot progression pisses me off so much.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,BonfireinRageValley,229,Mon Jun 15 05:05:38 2015 UTC,and then in the end something bad happens... yep
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,hasn0life420,95,Mon Jun 15 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"It was like almost every episode too, which is odd."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,PPvsFC_,63,Mon Jun 15 02:57:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel. The humor is so great, but the constant ""winning the battle but losing the war"" type of story is just getting on my nerve. The scene with Richard trying to get in touch with the guys, would've been really edge of the seat, if he had not encounter bad luck every.single.episode.  Not as excited for season 3 as I was for season 2, after the first finale."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Waywoah,165,Mon Jun 15 03:27:51 2015 UTC,Shit's getting really repetitive.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Troybarns,15,Mon Jun 15 04:09:35 2015 UTC,"It is like how in The Blacklist, someone gets kidnapped/involved in a car crash nearly every episode."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Jayhawk11,52,Mon Jun 15 04:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was sticking up for it before, because they always give you some kind of resolution or hope in the next episode. I figured they would just give us a win in the finale though, we've been through some shit, we've earned it. I am getting really frustrated at this point though, because now it's going to be significantly harder to enjoy the rewatch. It would have been great to rewatch it all while knowing things are looking good for them in the future."
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,fireballx29,280,Mon Jun 15 05:25:04 2015 UTC,Such a dank Philipino meme
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,kukukele,162,Mon Jun 15 04:00:26 2015 UTC,It's Filipino
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,LlammaPandaCat,28,Mon Jun 15 02:11:26 2015 UTC,Sadly I don't know any phone numbers in my phone either.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,nrubin29,24,Mon Jun 15 02:54:12 2015 UTC,Russ finally got his billionaire doors!
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,sw337,47,Mon Jun 15 02:41:27 2015 UTC,I hope this is as good as the season 1 finale.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,2ndChanceCharlie,49,Mon Jun 15 02:28:13 2015 UTC,It is going to be hard to match mean jerk time.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,JKaye57,84,Mon Jun 15 00:29:45 2015 UTC,That is a LOT to live up to. I think Jared would have to put on lederhosen and lead a mission to rescue the condor man while shouting in German to make this happen.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,grantishere,10,Mon Jun 15 01:29:08 2015 UTC,Not sure that it's actually physically possible.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,thatsmirkingwhore,124,Mon Jun 15 00:48:17 2015 UTC,Just finished up with GoT's.  I need to laugh.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,mrbrambles,58,Mon Jun 15 01:06:36 2015 UTC,Wow I totally feel you there. What an intense episode
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Named_after_color,16,Mon Jun 15 02:03:44 2015 UTC,so many holy shit moments
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,brianw25,15,Mon Jun 15 02:05:45 2015 UTC,picking lemons ends up being the most intense thing all night

SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,justgotanewcar,40,Mon Jun 15 02:37:15 2015 UTC,Was really hoping to see Jared get laid.   That guy fucks.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Wild_Cabbage,110,Mon Jun 15 02:06:00 2015 UTC,Really enjoyed this season - besides that damn episode where they deleted a third of the worlds porn or whatever - it has been really solid. I am very excited to see where they take season three.  All hail Baghead. Bighead. Bighetti. Leader. Visionary. Philanthropist.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,smackavelli,11,Mon Jun 15 02:37:07 2015 UTC,They did it more efficiently then anyone else. The other guys would have deleted way less then we did.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Wild_Cabbage,20,Mon Jun 15 02:33:08 2015 UTC,Discussing this show with you guys is intoxicating and magical. Just magical.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,Codeasaurus,8,Mon Jun 15 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"Are we ""your guys.""?!"
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,LlammaPandaCat,14,Mon Jun 15 02:13:44 2015 UTC,Oh god. I am so alone.
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,1sagas1,18,Mon Jun 15 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"Crap, now I have to wait 9 months for the next season."

SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,MakeCoolThings,14,Mon Jun 15 02:32:24 2015 UTC,doesn't Monica have a board seat? couldn't she have voted against the decision to remove Richard as the CEO? unless she was removed from the board?
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,JKaye57,34,Mon Jun 15 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Or it was a ""you vote with us or you're fired."""
SiliconValleyHBO,39uxy1,nolandw,22,Mon Jun 15 02:37:46 2015 UTC,"She, I believe, held the seat for Raviga because her boss allowed her to. Once gaining the majority, the boss obviosuly realized having Monica vote would not further her cause and told her she wouldn't hold a Raviga seat anymore."

SiliconValleyHBO,39xncc,hoodieroo,6,Mon Jun 15 23:03:39 2015 UTC,But he said he was using dban so unless Dinesh wrote a script to launch dban that instead caused a kernel panic...

SiliconValleyHBO,39xncc,multivacac,3,Tue Jun 16 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"Darik's Boot and Nuke:       Darik's Boot and Nuke, also known as DBAN /ˈdiːbæn/, is an open source project hosted on SourceForge.  The program is designed to securely erase a hard disk until its data is permanently removed and no longer recoverable, which is achieved by overwriting the data with pseudorandom numbers generated by Mersenne twister or ISAAC. The Gutmann method, Quick Erase, DoD Short (3 passes), and DOD 5220.22-M (7 passes) are also included as options to handle data remanence. [citation needed]  DBAN can be booted from a CD, DVD, USB flash drive or diskless using a Preboot Execution Environment. It is based on Linux and supports PATA (IDE), SCSI and SATA hard drives. DBAN can be configured to automatically wipe every hard disk that it sees on a system or entire network of systems, making it very useful for unattended data destruction scenarios. DBAN exists for x86 systems.   DBAN, like other methods of data erasure, is suitable for use prior to computer recycling for personal or commercial situations, such as donating or selling a computer.

I heard him say 'could' so I would quote it with 'could'  And I found it one of the funniest lines in the show last night also."
SiliconValleyHBO,39xncc,Znomon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:14:18 2015 UTC,dban causing a kernel panic is almost definitely an ops issue.
SiliconValleyHBO,39zp23,MCKapur,3,Tue Jun 16 02:22:51 2015 UTC,Hey now. The Breaking Bad house is on my list if I ever visit Albuquerque.
SiliconValleyHBO,39zp23,spacejunk76,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:25:57 2015 UTC,No BUT I can show you Steve Jobs house and Zuck's house if you want. Also I'm subleasing my apartment in PA for the next month if you know anyone looking ;)

SiliconValleyHBO,39zp23,WinkyElf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:39:37 2015 UTC,5230 newell road Palo Alto is the address from the show. But it isn't the right house from the shots in the show.
SiliconValleyHBO,39zp23,everintransit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:57:01 2015 UTC,I don't think house 5230 exists
SiliconValleyHBO,39zp23,needanacc0unt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:39:08 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it is in Los Angeles. Much of the filming is done down there
