starbound,3e2li2,quiqksilver,38,Tue Jul 21 13:58:10 2015 UTC,"Brought to you by the makers of The Burrito Maker 9k™, introducing the Pizza-Tron S7™. Instead of baking pizza at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, why can't we bake it at 400,000 degrees for 15 seconds? Well now you can! With our patented Warp-Cook technology you can have a perfectly cooked pizza from frozen to fresh in just 15 seconds! Our Warp-Cook technology uses ultra advanced concepts created by self-improving artificial intelligence! We start by defrosting the pizza with methane torches and molten lava. We then drop the pizza into slip-space where it is exposed to and cooked by concentrated waves of background radiation. To ensure quality, we then bombard it with hyper concentrated plasma streams.  Caution; when the pizza exits its containment field it may or may not have converted all of its mass into pure energy. In the event of mass-to-energy conversion, discard in nearest local gravity furnace. Do not ingest."

At the moment, the game is still in the ""add stuff"" stage, and will go through an optimization stage sometime after that.  The devs work at their own pace, so it may be a while before the game is at a point where they consider it complete enough to optimize and release it as complete."
starbound,3e4hl6,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"Apparentely the starbound devs read this subreddit fairly frequently so I decided to post this here to maybe grab their attention on this. I'm not sure how hard this is to fix, I know nothing about coding, but this is just sad since it makes large multiplayer servers impossible. They know about this though.. (it's kind of obvious)   It is on their to-do list, just like so many other things. What do you hope to accomplish by 'grabbing their attention' on it?  This isn't a single bug that you are pointing out, it's a broad statement that involves a large amount of development work and time across many areas. So it's kind of like saying ""I think you should make the game better"" in that it's a given really, they are working towards the same goal.    If you'd like a more tangible statement from the lead developer though, here is that: Tiyuri's comment on a terraria thread  He is talking about ""content"" there, but it also applies to optimization (which you are referring to). Optimization is one of the last things usually done on a large project like this. They have said that in many places as well, that this type of optimization will come later on, but they haven't forgotten about it.  Edit: Here is a post by another dev about performance optimizations."

You can play the same characters/world with all the other launchers (OpenGL, normal launcher, etc.). The only thing that matters is whether you're on mac or PC and which branch (stable/unstable/nightly).   Regardless, I won't be able to help you out with coords but I will link you this niftly little link that should have been pinned on the side-bar ages ago which tells you where to find certain planets/biomes/structures.   Generally, jumping from one alien planet to another is the best option for completing the progression as there you can find items also for later quests. Another tip is that you can only find one structure per planet so once you find one of the structures listed on that page don't bother searching the rest of the planet. Also don't forget to bookmark your planets for later use."

Whether you are on Mac or PC does not matter any longer, according to the devs. They all share the same universe.

You just have to keep looking. Though I suggest searching Risky and above planets since those also spawn structures like Avian Airships that have future quest items for you. (Treasure Map in that one)  Keep in mind that only 1 major dungeon can be found on any planet, if you hit one and it is not what you want you can leave for a different planet immediately.    If you want coordinates there is a huge Coordinates Megathread on the forums. You can use the search function to search only in that thread. (You can also look on /r/StarboundPlanets)  If you give up, you can go into admin mode and type /spawnitem moonemblem. If you need this for other items look at the /spawnitem info here."

I thought it was an interesting mechanic, though it obviously could have been vastly improved on. I hate how right now the nanosuits are literally just toggles on whether you can explore a planet or not, and that's anything but compelling."
starbound,3drvf8,Vox_R,2,Sat Jul 18 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"They're planning to bring hunger back eventually for harder difficulty levels. I'm with you, though. The update that got rid of those came out shortly after I started playing, so I didn't get to experience the mechanic much. The hunger was more of an annoyance, though. Maybe if the hunger bar was just left on the screen and didn't just pop in whenever, it'd be cool."
starbound,3drvf8,TanzNukeTerror,5,Sat Jul 18 21:42:06 2015 UTC,"One big problem I found with Hunger was that it was kinda pointless. You just farmed random monsters for meat on a low level planet, got a stock of 1000 raw meat, cooked it all and then just clicked a button every now and again.  There was never any real incentive besides roleplay to ever cook the advanced recipes."
starbound,3drvf8,Martenz05,2,Sun Jul 19 08:23:43 2015 UTC,The popular solution to that problem is to have food give small long term buffs that improve with food quality. I'd imagine that's a strong possibility if food comes back.
starbound,3drvf8,mechtech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:10:42 2015 UTC,"Isn't food already back in the Nightlies, giving short-term buffs that improve with food quality? I know a floran character of mine drank a lot of Kiwi Juice for the jump buff. It's just Hunger that's still being reworked."

They’ll be back in some form for harder difficulty levels"" (Source)  ""hunger as a maintenance stat will be included in higher difficult modes later"" (Source)      Some other links:   ""Quests are a bore, no survival aspects of the game and all the planets are near empty.""

I often find what I'm looking for that way.  Anyway, I, too, await when the game brings back the survival aspects of it.  If you just wanted to role play a bit, make a farm and settle down on a planet and build/survive, hunger and cold helped with that nicely.  If you're just an adventure type, I can see where you have no interest in survival.  CF should make them toggles and not relegate them to freaking hard modes! - thus punishing folks who just want some survival aspects in their game."

I've got plenty of free time, and an RSS program that tells me when something new is posted. I get all excited when I can answer stuff.

Most, if not all, of the planets in your starter system will be fairly similar. If you have the opportunity, or want to travel in /admin mode, look for a barren, lifeless planet. Suitable for large-scale builds. Those typically have some variety of sand and stone.  There's also a variety of 'normal'-looking dirt. Ranging from yellow-ish to red-ish, and some shades in-between.  There's a mod, 'Rock Names', that lets you collect the different types of stone that would usually just turn into the default cobblestone when harvested. I'd recommend using it. :D"

starbound,3dunsy,TanzNukeTerror,5,Sun Jul 19 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"It used to not have that effect, just the red ""woosh"" effect. However, that is the new loading animation for all teleportation/beaming.  On slower computers there is no telling how long it will take to load, therefore, that animation plays. On my computer it is nearly instantaneous.  Also, you are technically still flying through space. Your ship is not a thousand feet off the ground or something; it is orbiting the planet, far above the atmosphere. (Granted, this doesn't account for all the stars you see in the animation..)    I could understand the request for a new loading animation that only displays when you are beaming down to a planet. This animation could have no stars, and maybe change sky color from the dark of space to the sky of the planet, that would be cool. It could show in reverse for beaming up from a planet.  This would be kind of complicated and take time to implement though. It would also be weird in several scenarios. Like I said, on my computer it is nearly instant; does that mean that I am traveling super fast on some planets, but on the occasional ones I go really slow?"

starbound,3dunsy,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"I like to change the colors of my characters' armor using SBSE. That should allow you artificially convert the pallete of the red armors to pallete of the gray armors. However, you do have to download/install it before you can use it. (EDIT: On closer look, I think the gray armor might also have a slightly different shape.. I'm not sure, though.)"
starbound,3dunsy,soandso2,2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"It's like a totally different set. The grey set has the green bits in different places, the armor has a different shape, etc.  I don't know how I ended up with the grey set, but I only had 'Rock Names' at the time, so it couldn't be from a mod.  I really like the grey set. It looks more official and less flashy than the red set. I just haven't got a clue where I got it, and the only way I know to get more, is to duplicate it."

You got to remember it's a big server, usually has twice to five times the users other servers have logged in, and with such a big group people often get caught in groups making it hard to break in. That said there are usually 2-3 people sitting about waiting for something to happen."

The armor would be your best bet. If no story quests open up after that, do all your current quests and upgrade your ship (available after quests are completed), and more quests should open up.

Well if you don't have friends and you don't want to throw mods on, I'd say you have to push yourself a little bit. Although there is a ""story"" of sorts that goes through several quest-lines, the fun really comes from where you make of it.   Go out and start mining. Go out and find a bunch of dungeons. Go look at all the furniture and blocks. Imagine all the possibilities of building with said blocks. Get to the point where you can do the first mission, the boss battle is hella fun.

The deep sea trench and shallow sea biomes should be implemented in vanilla SB as they're very iconic and provide nice variety in regions to explore.  Especially that deep sea exploration stuff might become an adventure game in itself. Imagine ancient ruins or (space-)ship wrecks on the bottom of such a trench! Think of ""The Abyss"" here people! Really, there's some serious potential in this!  Or, given the depths such a trench would reach, there could be vanilla deep sea mining dungeons!   That comet biome is very cool as well, but it would really need a new type of ""comet"" star class to be implemented. Not that I'd mind though! Consider me positively interested!"

Interesting little movement mechanic that certainly beats struggling with energy-dashing."

starbound,3dl6ou,mccoyed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:59:26 2015 UTC,This is an acknowledged issue and IIRC the devs have mentioned they expect to at least double the framerate in these situations once they're at a stage in engine development where graphics stuff can be usefully optimized.

starbound,3dl6ou,mccoyed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"That's because everyone compares it to Terraria. I haven't played it extensively, so I'm not a source for this, but looking at the major updates Terraria has gotten it has boatloads of content too."

starbound,3dipcg,brandonwamboldt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"New Parallaxes are awesome and all, but don't let optimization take a back seat please. So many really good indie games focus so much on making the game look good, but forget to make the game run well. I know not every developer can have the optimization power of blizzard, who can make any of their games run on a toaster powered by a potato. But it should still be a priority.  Edit: Found a good way to phrase what I originally meant: I hope they don't add terribly optimized things with the mentality ""We'll fix it later."""
starbound,3dipcg,thetracker3,7,Thu Jul 16 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"They're currently in the ""add stuff"" phase. Optimization comes after that. Even the current quest system is a placeholder.  Considering Starbound runs better on my computer edit: craptop than pre-1.3 Terraria, I think we're good for now.  My only gripe is the start-up time, but I'm unaffected by that if I just leave it running."
starbound,3dipcg,brandonwamboldt,2,Thu Jul 16 16:36:47 2015 UTC,Yea the start up takes a while. Hopefully they'll be able to speed that up along with the fps when they release.

I see performance related fixes mentioned fairly often actually.  Artists work on art. Coders work on code. We've just been seeing more updates from artists lately as the coders are likely working on the same thing they have been for the last month (colonization, combat, performance, etc)."

starbound,3dipcg,thetracker3,4,Thu Jul 16 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"So it was in progress 1 year ago (http://playstarbound.com/july-15-everything-changed-when-the-tile-rendering-system-attacked/).    ""Even though the new renderer is running the new tile neighbor rules system for every single tile every single frame, the fullscreen cpu usage of starbound has actually gone down by about 30%*""   Also, if we look at recent patch notes, we see mentions of performance updates:  April 27th, 2015   ""Greatly reduced server->client bandwidth for updating player ships""   April 21st, 2015   ""Various improvements to server architecture which should greatly improve server performance and stability"" ""Various improvements to internal handling of Lua API calls which should greatly reduce CPU usage, particularly in areas with many monsters or NPCs"" ""Added optimizations and cyrillic character fixes for Hobo font""   And that's just what they felt like putting in the change logs themselves.

starbound,3dipcg,SupaSlide,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:13 2015 UTC,"Optimization comes after all things get implemented, or we'd have to suffer through an optimization process for every little thing that gets added to the game. And that would slow implementation a lot. And that would summon angry mobs of players with torches, pitchforks and sharpened words of hate.  Also, art stuff gets done in parallel to code stuff. When they show a neat new Viking-Ninja-Mutant space Alpaca or reworked parallaxes, coding isn't slowed down by it.  That said, I upvoted your comment. Optimization is a common enough question, and I preffer that your comment (and subsequent responses) remain at least visible for others that have similar doubts.

There are no more sectors, everything is on the same map. The Matter Manipulator is now your main tool, pickaxes are just 1 use boosts until you fully upgrade your MM. No Hunger or Temperature at the moment, but on higher level planets you need tech suits to survive. You get those tech suits and almost all other upgrades just by going through the quest line.

starbound,3dkhcz,TanzNukeTerror,3,Fri Jul 17 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"We are technically still in Stage 1. However I think that is mostly because they haven't bothered to say it has changed. It has been so long since then, I don't think they're even go by that system anymore.  If they are going by it, then I would estimate that we are in Stage 3, or at the very least Stage 2. (by their original parameters, though even those are off now)  If you want to see a far more recent outline for where we are in relation to launch, /u/Tiyuri made some statements about that here."

It's still in development and not 'released' yet. the devs are actively adding or changing things, in an unstable branch that's updated every night. So if you want the newest of the new, but also the best of the bugs, you can play that build. I don't know if that's new news or not."
starbound,3dk0u7,Fist99,3,Thu Jul 16 22:05:03 2015 UTC,"Semi-related. With the planned addition of more scanner features, it'd be cool for it to tell you ""large structure at this approximate location"" in X and Y coordinates or something.  If planets are scaled up, it'd be a real big pain to go searching and searching for stuff. Even if it only told you where one structure was, if there was several."
starbound,3dk0u7,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:11 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought as well. But then I realized that having cool stuff actually be a rare find kind of adds to the fun of it all. The problem with hard to find structures / settlements comes from the questing model that is currently in this version of the game. We receive a quest that we already know will lead us to game progression (those are, apart from one to my knowledge, the only ones currently in the game) and we are essentially forced to search several planets in order to find the required items. (Or just look up coordinates and essentially fast-forward the gameplay.)  When quests are reworked, this doesn't necessarily have to be the case anymore. That could lead to bigger planets being a good thing all around. It would definitely be a completionists nightmare though!"
starbound,3dk0u7,jaypetoh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:32:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, after the reworking of the quests and progression and stuff, larger planets would definitely be cool. I'd just rather not have to spend ~1h 45m just skimming the surface, you know? Even if it was 'fuzzy' X and Y coordinates, it might make the journey worth it."
starbound,3dk0u7,TanzNukeTerror,3,Thu Jul 16 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"Better idea: More scale variation. I personally don't like huge worlds. Too much time spent on traversing uninteresting terrain with the occasional chest that contains some minor variant of a gun I already have. Smaller worlds should have more interesting areas clustered together, while larger worlds should provide higher amounts of rarer ores due to more heat/pressure at their core.  For all I know, the game may actually already be this way. I just never actually took notice; the differences were likely too subtle."
starbound,3dk0u7,Muhznit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:44:55 2015 UTC,"they do have variation to a degree and what you say about larger planets might be true but yeah basically what I'm saying is exactly more variation. If it's called a planet then it should be the length of a planet, or at least larger than they currently have most. i agree completely with the small worlds being clustered and larger being more scattered plus that would really help establish colonies and trade posts to make the game feel alive. great idea!"

Also, I'm pretty sure the beginner world is pretty thin to begin with, and probably IS designed to mine for basic ores, and then get out of there to mine others. An alternative could be that some planets are thicker than others."
starbound,3dk0u7,SupaSlide,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the game already has random planet sizes (somebody correct me if I'm wrong) so some planets are bigger and some planets are smaller.

starbound,3ddqan,ULiopleurodon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"Because it uses perlin noise, that sort of thing is not easy to do. Soundwaves do not typically work out to vertical drops too well. That said, there must be settings to make it more or less like that. The issue is getting it to work the way you want.  Case-in-point: I tried doing some subterranean generators to do some really neat caverns. It took me literally 200 tries and it still wasn't doing what I wanted.   If there was some sort of visual editor where you could manually create the waves and drag around how they looked and then save it out in relevant JSON for the generator file...then it would be viable.  Unfortunately, I can't find anything remotely like that. And even if I did, there is no guarantee that the values it gave out would mimic those that SB uses.  For instance:  X , Y, Z in the visual program might read  20, 5, 10...but in SB the matching values might be  0.51, 0.1, 0.9 for all we know :)"

I'm not quite sure what you mean by more 'western-y', as these look fairly Samurai-ish. A few do look more submersible than samurai, but I think it balances out.  As far as I know, only Human armor has been reworked."
starbound,3dkk54,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:52 2015 UTC,I think I'm just forgetting the appearances of the armor and my mind is replacing it with ones made from my mind. Thanks :P.

starbound,3dkk54,WorldOfSven,2,Fri Jul 17 01:33:18 2015 UTC,"The actual armors themselves didn't change; rather their colours changed since their place in the progression changed (and in turn, the ores used to create them).

I don't have my old character to check, but I do have a screenshot. Think you can help?  Edit: Apparently, it's the Human Vanguard set. Which seems to have some red on it that didn't used to be there. I want the grey set. D:  Edit2: I still apparently have the grey set, on one of my characters. I'll have to see if duplicating it has any effect.  Edit3: I am so very confused. [GFY]"
starbound,3dkk54,HatsyaSouji,2,Fri Jul 17 05:00:24 2015 UTC,The reason for this is because a number of the human armors were updated visually. You may currently have old iterations of it on your person that will no longer be acquired through conventional means. Many of the old ones that we still think look good will likely resurface and be acquirable in some fashion.

starbound,3dhkpy,AndyMugu,5,Thu Jul 16 09:35:47 2015 UTC,"Unstable is for pre-Stable bug-fixing, when the update is nearly done except for some necessary polish. Nightly is ""the update is incomplete and still being worked on"". However different Nightly feels from the current Stable version of the game, until it is ""feature complete"", it should stay as Nightly.  Also, the player lands on an icy starter world in Nightly because the Chucklefish artists are working on surface microdungeons and parallax improvements for all worlds in a certain order. There is no singular starter planet, as it is different for every Starbound client with the exception of clients connecting to multiplayer servers."
starbound,3dhkpy,Mackinz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:41:27 2015 UTC,"I get that, but don't you find that sometimes the nightly builds are more fun & polished than unstable, & most players miss out on that-only to be changed the next day. For example, right now starting on a moderate threat planet has an interesting difficulty curve, and the fact that the planets are filled with wildlife makes the game feel more alive? Maybe it's just me then.  (Sorry about the broken english, I'm spanish, thanks for the correction!)"

starbound,3dfipc,manachar,7,Wed Jul 15 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"If you have a two-handed weapon, grab it. They act as great shields (right-click), and are time-based, not damage based. Don't bother with the critters at the bottom, until the end. Try to move as fast as possible, and flick all the levers before activating the cannon at the bottom.  Directly beside and above the giant crystal, are safe areas when it's in its second stage. (Four lasers in a 'scissor' action.)  Use the greatsword to block if you have to jump or drop through a laser, and try to take your time on the second attack stage. It's safer to sit directly beside it and munch bandages, than it is to panic when you have low HP.  Good luck!"
starbound,3dfipc,TanzNukeTerror,5,Wed Jul 15 21:47:02 2015 UTC,Solid tactical advice. I just feel the mission would be a lot more fun if I could test out a bunch of different strategies without a 10 to 15 minute tedious prelude.
starbound,3dfipc,lazarus78,3,Wed Jul 15 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"The mission doesnt respawn for 10 minutes of inactivity. So if you stay in the mission, it wont respawn.  They actually nerfed the boss from 3 stages to 2 thanks to complainers, now its even easier than before."
starbound,3dfipc,lazarus78,2,Wed Jul 15 23:52:56 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'm following. Likely because I just don't know the mechanics of Starbound enough yet.  I'm saying when I die at the boss it respawns me on the surface and I have to fight my way back to the boss. It's this fighting back to the boss that takes 10 minutes.
starbound,3dfipc,sayterdarkwynd,3,Wed Jul 15 23:57:52 2015 UTC,"The current version of the game has a feature that keeps an instance (mission or the outpost) from respawning for 10 minutes of inactivity. If it respawns each time, then you are not on the latest version."
starbound,3dfipc,lazarus78,3,Thu Jul 16 01:19:58 2015 UTC,Crap! You're right. Just played it. Died again (I'm really not good at combat yet). And then I was able to sail on down and beat the guy.  Thanks so much!
starbound,3dfipc,Optional_Design,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:56:50 2015 UTC,Havent fought that boss in a long time. It's only 2 stages now? That seems far too damned easy now. I think a more elegant way to solve the difficulty issue would just be to reduce damage that the laser blasts do. Cut it by 1/4 and it would be more than manageable.
starbound,3dfipc,dsp2003,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, only 2 stages. They cut out the middle stage with the faster spinning lasers and made the 3rd phase the second and final."
starbound,3dfipc,somenoefromcanada38,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"I completed this boss about an hour ago, here are my thoughts.   The difficulty caught me off guard but I feel it is reasonably balanced for a boss. The main issue I have with it is the iteration time. I died 3 times. The first I was caught a bit off guard with what to do. The second a combination of falling damage and ignoring the creatures at the bottom. The third through getting hit multiple times by a laser as it changed direction. I learnt from my mistakes. It helped I didn't have to start it from phase 1 each time. The problem I had that almost put me off completing it and just giving up to come back to later, was the time it took to run back down from the surface. There should have been a teleporter in the last room with the bed in before the boss. Allowing you to try again instantly even if you come back another time. With this in place I would have also been happy with the boss reseting to phase 1 each time as well. Because the difficulty was offset by the iteration time, allowing me to improve and learn without getting too disheartened. the I suggest watching 'When difficult is Fun' for anybody interested in game design. I also went in without a shield and not realising you can block the lasers, not realising this was an option, a npc before you going in warning you and giving you hints would also have been great."
starbound,3dfipc,MaxiTornado,3,Thu Jul 16 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"Bingo. You get my frustrations with the boss. Updating to the latest that prevents the mission from resetting greatly helped, but adding the teleporter would have been a great option.  As mentioned in that video, Super Meat Boy is a great example of enjoyable difficulty. I love hard bosses and challenges, but I also don't like wasting my time.  (PS, Just beat the boss thanks to the new update tip from /u/lazarus78)"
starbound,3dfipc,comicholdinghands,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"Speaking about the game design: CF thought the ""loophole"" when you could harm boss with normal weapons (albeit so slow) was a ""no-no"", so they deliberately removed such option (it was still present in Upbeat Giraffe builds) and now you are forced to use the levers even if your gun makes 1000 damage per shot."
starbound,3dfipc,SupaSlide,3,Thu Jul 16 08:11:47 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of surprised that people are struggling with this, did you just not understand how to do the fight?

It also means that you haven't yet received radiation protection, so you have not been to at least 8 planet types, 5 mini-biome types, and 6 major dungeon types.    So really, you have only seen about 30% of the game, since there are several whole systems that are not unlocked until later in the game. (like wiring, skyrails, NPCs, and monster capture)    On top of all of that, every single thing I just mentioned is getting majorly revamped and updated over the next several months. It has been stated that nearly all of the current quests are placeholder and will be completely replaced in the story focused update a few updates from now.

The universe should simply be an open and dangerous place.  Full of undiscovered recipes and unknowable solutions.  Players reward themselves when their creativity outmatches the challenge.  Think of any sandbox game you played and loved.  Chances are it had no rails.  It seems like the developers invented/designed this wonderfully large menu of procedural generation and it's being used as a backdrop for the next boss fight or ship upgrade.  Definitely, I think, the smartest thing Chuckelfish succeeded at was making Starbound mod-friendly.  This community has some seriously talented modders.  Dare I say they interest me more."
starbound,3db4kc,reoneclipse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:22:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. Maybe if they added the exploration part where you had to scan the planet to see if you could land there. That would be fun instead of just knowing already.

Mentioning the amount of money they already made (and still are making by putting ""cute screenshots"", milking 8-bit graphics/Terraria fans) Game has been ""developed"" for years now, and as a person who bought it as a pre-order (oh, the irony), I can tell you that this takes way too long, and will take much much longer, before they start ""finishing"" it. There has been many multiple lists of ""to do lists"" and ""beta schedules"", which all were dropped or never done.   To be honest, I launched Terraria out of sole boredom, and it has changed MORE than Starbound have... and afaik Terraria has been out of developement... Lol.  If I were to name a thing that changed the most of the Starbound page, that would be the amount of other games CF has released and advertised... :S"
starbound,3dchb8,Perqq,2,Thu Jul 16 10:32:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty disappointed with what I saw. Logged in, explored, and while there was substantial improvement in atmospheric exploration, it's still offset by the fact that you still find the same boring, uninspired things in the biomes/dungeons. Credits, whoo, great, ok. Where's the unique items? Accessories? Weapons? There's no real reason to explore in this game since everything gets very repetitive. Tiy should really just rip Terraria off and give it an actual progression-based progress."
starbound,3dchb8,lazarus78,3,Thu Jul 16 18:16:48 2015 UTC,Take a look at the news on the site. http://playstarbound.com/  The game has changes a lot and is still being worked on. The next update is overhauling many different things from random dungeons to quest missions to weapons.
starbound,3dchb8,Perqq,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:56:13 2015 UTC,"Posting ""cute pictures"" does not mean development progress. It means they are doing ""something"". They have been posting random stuff like this for years, yet 95% of them were never to be seen in game, or have been implemented and dropped soon after. So no, posts doesn't prove anything."
starbound,3dchb8,lazarus78,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:33:46 2015 UTC,"Except everything they've shown IS in the game. Seriously do you follow anything at all? They are working on improving planet biomes, weapons, AI, and colonies."
starbound,3dchb8,Perqq,0,Thu Jul 16 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"Sir, given the amount of time that has passed, and amount of shit they have scraped, I find your post funny, at most.   I don't know when you have bought the game, but I can tell you I bought it AGES ago, and amount of stuff they have presented and promised to do, and then removed or never done is just mind boggling. If you can't see that, I'm glad you are enjoying your time - but there are MANY people who are sick and tired of that ""development"" process taking forever, and you can't deny that."
starbound,3dchb8,lazarus78,2,Fri Jul 17 07:41:30 2015 UTC,"Theyve scrapped things, yes, that is the development process. Most people are used to seeing the last few months of a games development before release, but early access gives us a view at the WHOLE process. Its time consuming, its long, its slow, its boring. Get used to it if you want to buy in to early access games.  I bought the game back at like the first Koala version, so I've had the game for a while too. I took a long break, like many others, and came back to the Giraffe versions, and I feel the game is leaps and bounds better than Koala. Sure I miss temperature (Hunger can suck my dick), but overall I feel the game is progressing nicely at a steady and appropriate pace."
starbound,3dchb8,Perqq,0,Fri Jul 17 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"I bought the game in early access, when it ALREADY WAS in development. It takes WAY too much time, believe me."

starbound,3dchb8,Perqq,0,Fri Jul 17 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"You miss the part when there is some PLANNING done. Sure, betas and stuff take time, sometimes a LITTLE more than planned. Problem is, we don't even know how far they are, because there is no clean plan of what game will (eventually) contain. Heck, even they don't know. : /  But yeah man, I guess your diagram explains everything. :) Problem is, if you do not know how to design stuff properly, you can turn around in this cycle endlessly. And this is what we are seeing now, exactly."
starbound,3dchb8,lazarus78,2,Mon Jul 20 04:55:26 2015 UTC,"That is the nature of game development. Sure they may not have had much direction in the past, but they had a framework. Now that they have a framework, they are reving up production quite a bit. (Seen nightly lately?) This is all within the bounds of typical development. The difference is that we are seeing this process, where as the AAA titles that get released, we only see the butt end just before release, but they were well in the works for years before. Stabound is no different in that regard."
starbound,3dchb8,Perqq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"Look at any other indie game development process and how much time it takes. And now look at Starbound.  That aside, this is even more annoying that CF simply dismisses these comments and complaints in more or less harsh way (or even more, bans users that voice such opinions - me being a good example).  People are annoyed, they are looking for some word from developers, (not everyone feel like looking at the forums for 2 years for an update - people expect to get product ready asap) all they get is posts deleted on forums or simply getting ignored."
starbound,3dchb8,Afrotoast42,4,Tue Jul 21 08:42:59 2015 UTC,"The game isn't done and the devs aren't going to work any faster. I suggest you grab yourself a copy of 'frackin universe', 'more caves', and clef. All three are terrific mods that completely overhaul and add many times more detail than what the current game offers. You might also want to find the art pack of all the monsters rho designed that were taken out of the game after she left the team."
starbound,3dchb8,Mackinz,2,Wed Jul 15 10:19:06 2015 UTC,"and clef   That's mod? It doesn't add much detail or overhaul the game. It's mostly a mod for people who can't get over the loss of old game assets, and it shouldn't be something recommended to other people unless that is exactly what they are looking for, in my opinion.  Frackin' Universe is great, though."

starbound,3d4g7c,quiqksilver,49,Mon Jul 13 13:12:44 2015 UTC,"This weekend I was thinking about cool new planet biomes when I thought of the idea of a machine world. Instead of caves you would have ""access tunnels"" and ""service lines"". Robotic enemies only and unique hazards and structures.  Here are a few more I had that were less fleshed out...  Frozen Gas World: http://gfycat.com/AcclaimedAcrobaticDungenesscrab  Alien Grass Lands: http://gfycat.com/CourageousUnnaturalHoatzin"
starbound,3d4g7c,Sir_Cuitry,22,Mon Jul 13 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"Great ideas. I tried doing a frozen gas world a while back (inspired by interstellar), but the perlin generators didn't guarantee that platforms would be within jumping distance. I don't think this is currently feasible as a random planet the way we have other biomes.  The machine worlds are also great, but would have to be one giant dungeon to maintain the 'blockiness' and logical item placement."
starbound,3d4g7c,iDrinkDrano,13,Mon Jul 13 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"A dungeon world sounds amazing, so long as it got progressively more difficult the further you go. Perhaps most of the blocks are indestructible until you disable the planetary core, so it's really hard to go deep, loot, and survive getting back to the surface."
starbound,3d4g7c,Sir_Cuitry,13,Mon Jul 13 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this can be done. Dungeons are composed of preset 'rooms'. The allowed room linkages can be specified. So you could have something like ""level 1 room can connect down to another level 1 room, or to a level 2 room"". By having the downwards linkages only be same or greater difficulty, then the dungeon should get progressively more difficult as you go deeper.  Otoh, without having a lot of preset rooms, it would start to look repetitive pretty quickly."
starbound,3d4g7c,CaptianZaco,2,Mon Jul 13 16:59:22 2015 UTC,maybe some sort of massive community project? it would be a hell of an undertaking but it might be feasible.
starbound,3d4g7c,RobbieMcSkillet,3,Tue Jul 14 21:48:01 2015 UTC,That planet in interstellar was AWESOME I had never even imagined such a structure for a planet. I'd love to see something like it in starbound.

starbound,3d4g7c,Darkpursuer,4,Mon Jul 13 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"I knew I had seen this idea somewhere before. Even if you couldn't get them to spawn exactly how you liked, I don't really have a problem with higher difficulty planets being harder to navigate. I think stuff like that and high risk machine worlds would be great end game content. Players who come unprepared will be killed quickly in places like that."
starbound,3d4g7c,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to only have machine themed monsters to spawn? Or rather, monsters with machine body parts."
starbound,3d4g7c,Darkpursuer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"Well there's a few machine-based, but not very many. So you could just spawn those. (although it would get hella repetitive quickly)  Not sure on the extent of randomized monster parts though"
starbound,3d4g7c,Sir_Cuitry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:36:32 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it didn't need to be too blocky. If it's a planet with machine lifeforms, some parts can look like it was ""grown"" rather than built. Kind of like cybertron in the movies."
starbound,3d4g7c,Darkpursuer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"Well, you can do something like that easy. You know how current worlds are blobs of dirt and stone?

You can even have it randomly place those electric traps and similar things the way it places chests."

starbound,3d4g7c,Tarmen,2,Mon Jul 13 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"The idea of gas planets you can traverse is really interesting to me. It would be a late game world that required one of the flying techs, with hidden levels to it and MASSIVE flying creatures that hunted you, with storms that pushed you about. It would function similar to meteor worlds, with less frequent ""clouds"" or floating debris to stand on, but much larger. The gas planets would have gravity, while the asteroid worlds would not, to differentiate them further."
starbound,3d4g7c,newtype06,2,Mon Jul 13 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"Both Frozen Gas world and Machine world are awesome!  The Alien Grass Land is cool too, but I'm less excited about the idea."

starbound,3d4g7c,runetrantor,3,Tue Jul 14 00:08:50 2015 UTC,No I agree Starbound is definitely the kind of game to where rule of cool takes precedent over realism and I wouldn't have it any other way. Sterotypical radioactive glowing goo ftw.  I just felt like sharing some fun trivia
starbound,3d4g7c,HatsyaSouji,0,Tue Jul 14 01:05:34 2015 UTC,Like.... energon ?
starbound,3d4g7c,aguycalledspyke,4,Tue Jul 14 23:26:02 2015 UTC,And at it's core is a huge and dangerous reactor that if you breach it could explode the planet or at the very least shut down power planet wide while a horde of machine rush to defend it and fix it.
starbound,3d4g7c,Bellofortis,3,Mon Jul 13 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"And machine worlds could have variants too!  Like, the standard one.  A destroyed one that's in the vacuum and has more dangers around from wreckage.  And a planet that is normal, dirt, grass and all, but as you go deeper it turns out to be an ancient machine world that just accrued too much dirt and got buried in it. (Maybe have an accompanying 'asteroid' biome variant that's a debris field from an ancient battle over it. So instead of rocks, you explore the damaged hulls of ships)"
starbound,3d4g7c,aguycalledspyke,3,Mon Jul 13 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm considering making another couple iterations of this concept. If I do I'll post it on the reddit."

starbound,3d4g7c,-Xren-,3,Fri Jul 17 01:21:53 2015 UTC,"Huh, this is a pretty rad-looking concept, love the idea of a machine-esque biome. How would exploration on a planet such as this work - would it be a more dungeon-y planet with few resources but lots of loot to be found? I'd imagine it being a very dangerous environment to explore, but with the reward of beuing able to salvage loot or materials in large quantities (if you're skilled enough!)"
starbound,3d4g7c,solidfake,3,Mon Jul 13 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"To fulfill one purpose and keep the tiles all accessible perhaps it could be full of all those metal/industrial/ship type blocks we love for building. For balance and realism (such a planet looks really dangerous to approach, is it alive and actively trying to prevent you from landing?), youd need some sort of thruster/teleporter/shield upgrade for your ship, or maybe a ship ID spoof so that it doesnt recognize you as a threat.  I think this would be a cool theme to explore overall, rather than focusing on boss battles like some other games a few special planets themselves could be bosslike on their own merits."
starbound,3d4g7c,IcyBreeze00,2,Mon Jul 13 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like it'd be mid-to-late game, so having an unlockable item such as an ID spoof or shield would be neat, although it could alternately be done with high-damage/health mobs as a deterrent - you can try to go for the loot early on and risk an ass-kicking, or take it in your own stride and face it when you think you're ready for the challenge. Either way, the payoff should be sweet; not only that feeling of getting that rare loot but that feeling of being finally strong enough to traverse this dangerous environment that's been looming in the background for so long."

starbound,3d4g7c,MaxiTornado,-3,Tue Jul 14 15:14:57 2015 UTC,"So you built an extremely expensive metal planet for... What? To put a bunch of robot sentries on it? Spare me the bullshit, this just won't work without additional detail."
starbound,3d4g7c,The_Dragonn_29,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:38 2015 UTC,Maybe it built itself. We're talking about a cartoon planet in a universe with talking birds and monkeys here.
starbound,3d4g7c,MaxiTornado,-3,Tue Jul 14 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"You think another sentient race in our galaxy can't resemble monkeys or... Birds? A bird isn't even a single animal, it's a whole fucking family of them. All they need is feathers and wings to be called birds."
starbound,3d4g7c,The_Dragonn_29,4,Tue Jul 14 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"No I think it's highly unlikely that any other sentient race would even remotely resemble earth creatures, let alone look exactly like monkeys and birds. However this is a cartoon fantasy game where you fight cute pokemon creatures, use a pickaxe to tunnel hundreds of meters under the ground, and fly around in a spaceship that can travel lightyears in a few seconds.   There is a little thing called suspension of disbelief. I just find it kind of weird that with everything in Starbound, robot planets are the thing that you just can't accept."
starbound,3d4g7c,MaxiTornado,3,Tue Jul 14 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of iron and steel, it could be made from something else, like a new kind of metal. It wouldn't unbalance the game by finding an iron based planet and would be fun to see.  What if it was made by the same beings that made the Glitch? A planet terraformed for the likeness of the Glitch."
starbound,3d4g7c,The_Dragonn_29,-2,Mon Jul 13 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the Glitch are just robots make in big numbers across many star systems, I'd say. Sure, someone had to make the prototypes, but you can't exactly ""mass-produce"" a planet."

Usually, I'd have the taskbar on the right border of the screen, but Windows 8's ""hot corner"" in the bottom left is problematic, at times.  Edit: I could make more space by cutting out the dividers and moving some other stuff around. I don't know if there's any desire for this, though, so I'll only do that if people ask.

I changed three or four values in CSS. I'm not a programmer, though. So I've no idea how much work it would be to adjust the height of the launcher itself."
starbound,3d5mwv,KaedeAoi,-2,Tue Jul 14 01:13:44 2015 UTC,"What's changed in it? Also, what do you mean 720p ""friendly""?"
starbound,3d5mwv,KaedeAoi,5,Mon Jul 13 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"Actual launcher, for comparison.  I moved the ""latest update"" text and the Creeperhost button up to the top-right, and squished the ""join the Starbound community"" button up.  I mean ""720p friendly"" as in, the current launcher doesn't fit well on 720p screens. Unless you hide the taskbar or have it on the sides, you can't click any of the ""launch Starbound"" buttons.  Moving a few things to the top-right is one way to make the height of the launcher a bit more friendly to 720p screens, since not everyone is running full HD."
starbound,3d5mwv,MaxiTornado,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"There are still people with HD screens? Even my 5 year old laptop is 1600x900. Interesting. I like it. Could be a little wider, so that it fits the screen perfectly, but I like it."
starbound,3d5mwv,MaxiTornado,2,Tue Jul 14 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"Some people might not be able to game at higher than 720p. I've seen a few people point out that the launcher doesn't play well with 720p screens, so I figured I'd have a go at seeing if I could make it fit.  I don't game higher than 720p either. The framerate is good and the graphics are okay. Movies and stuff in 1080p, though."

Normally, light penetrates through the ground and walls to a certain extent.  But when you're inside, say you turn the lights off in a room, it will still be fairly lit up by adjacent rooms. Not sure of a good way to fix but just though I would speak my mind because it is a little immersion breaking to turn the lights off and go to sleep but still have the room be lit up.

starbound,3d2s0a,-Fennekin-,2,Mon Jul 13 06:52:44 2015 UTC,Yes they did. This is an old design of a ship that was used in Starbound once. Said design is since not in the game anymore. What i find funny is that they managed to make it look bad with over satured light

Chucklefish decided to try out shared starter systems with the giraffe updates, and will be changing it, eventually, so that there is an option to not start on the same system. This will take a while though, because I last heard that it's not a simple fix."

This feature allows your characters to leave items and bases for each other on the original planet to speed up the early game. There have been complaints about this solution by many people and this has been posted on reddit already."
starbound,3d3pz4,somenoefromcanada38,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:45:33 2015 UTC,It's intentional - you could just make a base where you put a bunch of ores and stuff so you don't have to do the first quest bull with all your new characters.

However, the devs are working on a fix to make characters start on different planets.  To remove the starter world that's been used by other characters: If you know the coordinates of it, find the world file in your universe folder and delete it (the coordinates are in the file name). If you don't know the coordinates you can just delete the whole universe folder to wipe all planets.

Because as many others have said, this is simply the nature of a game genre with many games that can't help but have very similar themes. I did try to make a few comparisons below though.  Yea, the art style, especially of all the tiles, is very Starbound like. And many of the features/elements are also extremely similar.  It does at least have some distinguishing features though (even though most are from Terraria). The magic system seems really cool.  Stuff from Starbound:   Tile and Building sprites (so much, nearly identical) Game premise / setting Mechs Several techs just have new sprites (ground smash, dash, vehicles) Monster capture Boat     Stuff from Terraria:   Worms that travel through blocks Some enemy/magic sprites (like the worms) Much of the magic system Partial colony system (also from Starbound but Starbound did it after this trailer) Sliding on ice and speed of movement Wings Fishing     Unique stuff:   Mech that releases a small drone More enemies that destroy blocks (more explosions) Enemy sprites Grapple mechanics Some of the magic mechanics:   turning into enemies all the different fireball attacks ice shards attack throwable purple orb attack  Mounts (also kind of a reskin of vehicles)   tl;dr - Yea, they basically used Starbound as a starting point, tweaked some of the sprites, added some Terraria elements, then made several unique things. Plenty to avoid lawsuits though.  It's still very early in development, so over time they will probably change the sprites more and more so it looks less like the 2 games they were ""heavily inspired by"".  In all honesty though, it does have some very cool elements. I'll probably play it when it is closer to coming out if it keeps getting more unique. (They recently had a failed kickstarter, so might be quite a while still)  Edit: I haven't seen Edge of space, Crea, Signs of Life, or Darkout. So I'm only going off the 2 games I have played."

While each has a few neat systems for making it unique (starbound w/ multiple planets, Terraria with heavier RPG elements, or linked game with its combat focus), they all essentially boil down to metroidvania style platforming & combat combined with a tile editor :P"

Most of the things showcased here I'm certain Starbound could already do or some modders are already on it.

starbound,3cwtj8,serphilith,2,Sat Jul 11 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"No problem!  I'm happy to answer, though you need to understand  I'm not a game dev, just your everyday programmer who is interested in games and their development cycles.  Admittedly, I have not followed Star Citizen much due to limited time, but the thing that a lot of people fail to understand is how much work goes into creating a game.  While it is relatively simple to create flash games, or even something as big as 1.0 Terraria (which still took what, a year or more with a 3-man team?  Not that ReDigit didn't do most of the following, it was just largely on a smaller scale), for the AAA titles, there is a TREMENDOUS amount of work that goes into them.    Not only is there coding, but you have 2-D and 3-D asset creation, including meshing, animating, particle effects, and explosions (Cue Mr. Torgue); Pathing (that's a big one), AI (Another big one), Game rules, mechanics, economy, Net code (yet another big one), and then tying all this up into a real-time system that is event-driven (that's definitely not all of the pieces, either).  And all of this assumes the engine is working correctly, which can introduce additional issues.  And all of this does not include building a website and forums (tools make this a lot easier than it used to be), managing expectations while still keeping hype up, dealing with forum trolls, internet trolls, legal trolls, DDOS attacks on your servers, hacking attempts, and piracy.  Meanwhile, your fans are clamoring for more information and viewing it under a microscope, looking for any clues to what your intentions are, and then raising pitchforks and torches when there's a mistake.  On top of this, many game devs will work 60-90 hours a week with little or no vacation, especially during crunch time.  Games are not small undertakings.  I consider them to be amongst the most difficult tasks a group of people can undertake, and yet we churn out these games at an incredible rate, which belies their difficulty.  I hope that answers your question and I didn't go off topic too much."

I have dozens of friends that played original DayZ and got the standalone and none are happy with it. It's a buggy, unfinished mess that is practically vaporware at the moment. Even Dean Hall bailed from what I've heard."
starbound,3cwtj8,FogeltheVogel,2,Sat Jul 11 14:32:48 2015 UTC,This picture could come from anywhere related to game development and it'd still be true. The place of origin is not really relevant in this context

starbound,3cwtj8,Figgots,6,Sun Jul 12 04:59:20 2015 UTC,It's less about comparing one to the other than showing a general principle of game development which the communities of some games seem to have forgotten - though I fully agree with you that Starbound is miles ahead of DayZ standalone in a lot of aspects.
starbound,3cwtj8,Brainling,-4,Sun Jul 12 15:37:15 2015 UTC,Well to be fair one's in alpha and one's in beta.
starbound,3cwtj8,Figgots,5,Sat Jul 11 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"DayZ SA has been alpha for nearly three years. It's a bad joke, and not even close to comparable to Starbound."
starbound,3cwtj8,tehosiris,-1,Sun Jul 12 04:57:29 2015 UTC,"Which is probably why it's still in alpha. They've got a lot working against them, mainly a horrible fucking engine."
starbound,3cwtj8,-Fennekin-,2,Sun Jul 12 07:03:14 2015 UTC,"That they decided to go with. Best excuse ever. Development is slow : or engine stinks. The game sucks: our engine stinks.    Can't blame them, it was free. Cashing it on the arma 2 engine was the very last thing Bohemia ever expected before DayZ. Sadly, It'll take years before it's gone forever, down the drain with early access and pre-orders."
starbound,3cwtj8,simsoy,31,Sun Jul 12 07:06:38 2015 UTC,I see what you mean. With the difference that we are actually getting new content from Starbound.
starbound,3cwtj8,-Fennekin-,10,Sun Jul 12 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"DayZ has been in development for three years now and the SA is more broken then the mod version. In that time Starbound and Star Citizen have both been crowdfunded and full of content, ambition and actual development. Money doesn't develop a game, it pays the people who develop a game but having $80 million like Star Citizen doesn't make development go plaid speed.  DayZ on the otherhand hasn't done shit."
starbound,3cwtj8,simsoy,5,Sat Jul 11 14:54:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. The only game that had less development is cubeworld.... But even that was fantastic as a game.... altough the developer claims that he's still working on it..
starbound,3cwtj8,-Fennekin-,3,Sat Jul 11 20:21:39 2015 UTC,"A game like Starbound will probably be out early next year, maybe a couple of update patches here and there as new buyers come in just like Terraria. Star Citizen is the most ambitious game of this era, other ambitious games took about five years so they'll probably be hitting 1.0 sometimes 2018 or early 2019. A game develops as well as the team making it, if they have a solid vision of what they want to do and faith in their product. I don't know much about the DayZ development but as someone who played the mod there doesn't seem to be anything to the SA version, it's broken and utterly lacking in features. You can't have a three year alpha going without making any progress. Look at the progress Star Citizen is making with all their ships, showing off damage models, showing off FPS and Squadron 41. Look how far Starbound has come. DayZ is just disappointing in comparison."

starbound,3cwtj8,Milguas,14,Wed Jul 15 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"The difference is, most of this traditionally happens before the game is released. It's too bad Starbound had to be one of the leading games to demonstrate how frustrating early access can be. Unfortunately, the result is that the game developer loses credibility when their game is released in alpha quality and then spends additional years in alpha.   I've learned from this that I'd rather have the game not be released until it's ready, and the developer just says ""it'll be done when it's done"" when bugged about a release date. Or even give a release date and repeatedly slip it -- the point is, quality should come first with software. Devs like Chucklefish who put the release schedule as their first priority are doing themselves and the community a disservice in the long run. Sure, maybe the game would never have been made if it weren't for people buying it before it was released, so they had to do early access. Still, it's frustrating to play an alpha game and get burnt out on it before it's even a complete game.  This sub is a huge part of the core community for this game, so I know that most of you probably disagree with me on all of this. But consider that most people, and especially the greater masses of casual-to-moderate gamers, want to buy a game that is good and feels complete at the time that they buy it. By the time Starbound is in that state it will have already been out for years."
starbound,3cwtj8,leisuretown,2,Sat Jul 11 15:32:09 2015 UTC,People BEGGED and badgered CF to release what they had since to them it looked like the game was ready for release from what they saw in the news posts.
starbound,3cwtj8,Milguas,8,Sat Jul 11 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"Allowing a vocal minority of customers to steer a software project is not smart. Compromising with the community is a bad idea for a game development studio. Behind every successful project is a single person or small group of people who provide the drive, passion, and management to see the project through. If this group lets outsiders bend and sway them as the wind blows, then the project is doomed to mediocrity at best. Not saying that's what happened here, but CF themselves have admitted that some difficulty has arisen from trying to placate the community."
starbound,3cwtj8,Milguas,3,Sat Jul 11 19:54:15 2015 UTC,Very true. ANd that's why they've stopped giving as much power to the playerbase and have been doing their own thing at their own pace. WHich is also another reason so many idiots harp on them and on SB

starbound,3cwtj8,MaxiTornado,2,Sun Jul 12 03:31:37 2015 UTC,"The image probably wants to convey less that the dev team is in charge of finances and more that they're limited by them - working faster almost always requires some kind of trade-off, be that more oversights and bugs or a higher cost (to hire more programmers, for example). Though I agree that that point might be a little misplaced/badly explained."
starbound,3cwtj8,ZorbaTHut,2,Sat Jul 11 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"You know, another thing I don't understand is the red arrows going backwards. You don't implement something you already tested, because it's already implemented. Sure, new features, bug fixes, changes, balancing and so on exists, but that's still completely representable by the left side."
starbound,3cwtj8,teetow,2,Sat Jul 11 18:01:51 2015 UTC,"In iterative software development, the steps are more commonly represented as a circle (rather than a line with backtracking arrows). You design a little, you develop that, you test that part, you get feedback, the go back to the beginning.  When you design a software architecture, you can't account for every possible change that you may want to make in the future. You can only make your best guess, and when you get feedback from your client (in this case, the player base), they may propose changes you did not anticipate, or changes you didn't create hooks for because it would impact memory/processor performance.  That's why you have to go back to implementation (and even design) after testing. One small change can require a cascade of changes. When you design software well, you reduce this ripple effect by decoupling the components from one another, but this is still done at a high level so people working on one part of the system don't break something working in another part of a system.   Even when you plan things perfectly, things still break. This can come from sequences of input your system did not expect (that's why larger game companies hire people to do QA and literally brute force the system in real time)[1]. It can also come from unexpected hardware changes (they are developing for a fluid platform, not one with fixed hardware, so there is a lot more to account for).  Programmers in any other sort of domain get paid a lot because this is very difficult, especially on large projects. That's why my favorite addition to the player base in this image is ""patience"". Adding more people does not speed up development (this is a concept illustrated in a book called ""The Mythical Man Month""). Good software takes time, good software with shifting requirements takes even more time to do correctly.  [1] This is the root of early access resentment, in my opinion. People don't want to feel like they are paying for the privilege of doing quality assurance. That's probably also why Minecraft was only $5 when it came out (and only raised the price when additional stability and features were added)."
starbound,3cwtj8,MaxiTornado,0,Sat Jul 11 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Well, in the testing process, you might realize that you implemented something in the way that's not completely satisfactory, which means back to the drawing board. I don't exactly understand what you mean by ""completely representable by the left side"", as that would mean that you wouldn't use the knowledge gained during the testing process to go back and change the implementation - it would mean that you would implement your design, test it, take note of the flaws, but not do anything to fix them, which doesn't make sense at all."
starbound,3cwtj8,Ende_schon_heute,4,Sat Jul 11 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"That would be a new process. You also don't ""gain"" any knowledge, if you know how your game engine, that YOU designed, actually works."

There's always issues you hadn't thought of and capabilities you hadn't thought of. And yes, this is true even if you wrote the game design and the engine from scratch."
starbound,3cwtj8,Ende_schon_heute,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"It's an illustration, and a decent one. The whole point of the red arrows is to counteract the ridiculous idea of software development as a steady, linear progress through a set workflow. Sometimes you fix bugs, sometimes you change details in the implementation, sometimes you flip tables and start over."
starbound,3cwtj8,teetow,0,Sun Jul 12 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you never look back and say: You know what? Let's just revert the progress we made."
starbound,3cwtj8,MaxiTornado,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"Define progress!  Yes, you do kick bits and even working parts out and into the trash and revert back to designing something new if the initial approach doesn't fit in or work out as a part of the whole.  Especially in game design, be it for a videogame, tabletop or P&P RPG, a designer will often trash early drafts or parts of it and then, based on the new needs and gained knowledge, redesign.  This takes time and resources of course, and this is really strikingly illustrated in the little chart."
starbound,3cwtj8,teetow,-1,Sat Jul 11 23:25:48 2015 UTC,"Well, sure, but those are drafts. Once you've actually made something, you can't just fucking dump it out. Or if you do, you might as well save some of it for another game. Simply deleting stuff seems REALLY wasteful to me."

Now literally EVERYONE is at least a little bit pissed.  This just to illustrate that is does really happen to released products over time.  But, anecdotal ramblings aside, I do consider an alpha version of a game, early access or not, as some sort of draft and expect changes to happen. YMMV but thus it is."
starbound,3cwtj8,MaxiTornado,0,Sun Jul 12 10:43:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's exactly what you do -- if you define ""progress"" as ""percentage of completion,"" which would seem to be the definition you're most comfortable with."

I, for my part, clock in at over 1000 hours in SB and feel I still have a lot of fun to look forward to. And all of this in the knowledge, that there are people behind the game who want to have THEIR share of fun with the product, designing it, subsequently playing it.

Working graphic design and web design for the last 15 years, I have such periods quite regularly if its something I don't genuinely feel for.

As for your second question, the Unstable build is currently exactly the same as Stable, so you would not see any change. The Nightly build however has tons of changes. If you would like to see those changes earlier than sure it is worth playing.  Just remember the Nightly build is not for normal gameplay though. Most of the changes are incomplete or broken. For example, if you started a new game on there you would be stuck on a Snow planet, unable to get the Iron to progress to another planet. Even if you did get past that, then you would get stuck behind a door in the Floran Mission. Both are passable with admin commands, just not ""normal"" play."

starbound,3czi40,TheInversed,16,Sun Jul 12 04:56:21 2015 UTC,"I wasn't going to comment on this because I don't have the time to give it the answer it deserves.. but the other comments on here are rather disheartening and don't address your questions at all, so here is what I can quickly manage:  *All my own opinions (imagine me prefacing all of this with ""I think ~"")   The movement controls are less encumbered, even in the early game. For example you don't use the keyboard to turn around, your player just follows your mouse. However, Starbound does not have the insane freedom of movement and speed that you get in Terraria with the upper levels of accessories and wings. The speed stays rather consistent, only marginally helped by tech. It is almost two thirds of the way through a rather long Beta. There are about another 5 major updates coming, which are 2-3 months apart. The full release/launch is not expected for another 8-12 months. Here are links for upcoming features and the CEO's brief statements about the next updates before launch. -- I actually posted more precise release estimates after the CEOs statements there if you want to look at those. The CEO (Tiyuri) responded in a way that suggests the updates will come faster than my timetables, so there's that. The progression in this game is through a singular linear quest line. Through the questline you will get the necessary tech to explore harder planets. Every 8-10 quests there is a major ship upgrade that gives you more space, crafting possibilities, and player enhancements (tech). Around the same time as those upgrades are  instanced missions that are currently required to progress. These are pre-made areas that take 20-30 minutes to get through, that have a boss battle at the end. These missions are still being made though, so on the main game right now (called the Stable branch) only 1 is really complete. Another has the area complete but not the boss battle, and 2 others have only the boss battle. Before the game launches it will have 8 of these full missions and boss battles.   In conclusion I think you would enjoy it if you bought it. It does some things better than Terraria and is in general a very different game. Sure, it currently lacks a lot of the polish that Terraria has, but that is coming to this game as well.  Most people, including myself, tend to player it for a while after major updates then put it down to wait for the next, eventually totally hundreds of hours. And really, each time is a lot of fun and worth the price.  Hope this helps. I'll try to answer any other questions you have."
starbound,3czi40,Varixai,5,Sun Jul 12 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"Correction, the alpha is about 2/3 done... In beta, this game is not. You can not have a beta of software that isn't feature complete.  Regardless of whether someone thinks it's alpha or beta, the game does not have a definitive due date because every time the devs try to put a time table on things, they woefully underestimate.  What started out as a 2013 deadline jumped to 2014, 2015, and now 2016; If history is the greatest teacher, I'd anticipate much more time than most people are willing to quote as the general accepted deadline."

I feel pretty much the same way about the game, for a game that hasn't been released yet it shows itself already really rich and you can feel how much potential it holds.  That is a totally arbitrary statement but i feel like this game is only half done by now and already fun to play, i just can't wait for the future updates they are going to be defining ones!"
starbound,3czi40,nagifero,6,Mon Jul 13 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"I'd wait for release.  I've revisited Terraria since the release of 1.3.  I then just played the nightly build of Starbound this evening.  The current nightly feels much better than previous builds.  Character movement is more fluid, cave generation is more interesting, chest distribution felt rewarding, and chest contents had a variety of loot.  There were a few npcs on my starting planet, but the monsters are still limited to 3 types.  There has been some excellent progress imho with cave generation, loot distribution, and character control since the last stable release.  Previously I would have said that Terraira's movement felt better, but having played the two in the same day and with this nightly build Starbound felt better... more agile... less battle toad.  I think the genre still has room for Starbound, I'd just wait for release at this point."

starbound,3czi40,Byzantine_Guy,6,Sun Jul 12 06:01:02 2015 UTC,It's a very nice Beta though.
starbound,3czi40,MrButtermancer,3,Sun Jul 12 06:05:39 2015 UTC,It's been in purgatory for years. It's still vastly inferior to Terraria. I'd be very cautious.  I regret buying it.
starbound,3czi40,candersonza,2,Sun Jul 12 07:04:35 2015 UTC,Development is definitely moving forward.  I'm sure you won't regret buying it when it is out of beta.
starbound,3czi40,sayterdarkwynd,-2,Mon Jul 13 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"Vastly inferior...to you. Not to everyone.   I'd not be cautious. Totally worth the purchase, and once it's feature-complete it will beat the shit out of Terraria in some ways, and be less in others. Which is as it should be, since both are COMPLETELY different games."
starbound,3czi40,MrButtermancer,3,Tue Jul 14 18:17:48 2015 UTC,"That's like saying a well-illustrated children's book is going to be better to some people than a masterfully written novel. Technically true, but it ignores the likelihood somebody has traditional tastes and dismisses the effort of the author.  Starbound has considerably less content, has gotten less content updates even since the main developer of Terraria said he was moving to other projects, and has been in early access for years.  I watched them on kickstarter for a long time before they even came to Steam. Their progress is primordial. The build quality does not justify what they've made given the time they've taken. Numerous studios have done more with less in terms of both time and money."

starbound,3czi40,Emgiell,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"Stick with Terraria, development is very slow and we haven't seen any major game-play changes so far. The game has you go through the same mining grind to only have you do it again when you finish the required Dungeon or Boss.  The game will become stale to a Terraria player very fast.  If you wish to have the same planet exploration feel in Terraria create a new world and place a colored filter over the screen, it feels exactly the same."
starbound,3czi40,sayterdarkwynd,0,Sun Jul 12 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"There have been MASSIVE gameplay changes since the initial release.   The content in there right now is by and large Placeholder stuff so that you can try all the content and is not how the final progression will work.  I played Terraria like crazy. I prefer Starbound in look and feel. Both do things in different ways, and are not really all that comparable."
starbound,3czi40,Star4ce,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"Movement is best described as ""Look with mouse, move with WASD"". You can modify movement with several techs that let you dash through air, morph into a ball an roll, jump really high, you name it. Fighting wise you have three main types of combat. Ranged weapons that vary from shotguns to rocket launchers and can have a range of special effects on them (like spread fire, sticky rounds, among others). Melee weapons in various sizes. And currently widely unused craftable/collectible weapons like throwing bombs, molotov cocktails, tarballs, etc. They're vastly underpowered compared to the others. Else? You dig, you build, you travel through the universe in your private ship. There's a TON, really, I mean a TON, of different materials to build stuff with. And strangely I find the mining part very soothing and fun, you always find something below the surface. I'd call it mid/late beta. The direction is pretty clear what is to be done and you get constant updates (website and client) from the devs. There are a few major updates planned along the ongoing year which revamp a portion of the game to (hopefully) the final stage. Currently the progression is: Gather materials, build armor and weapon, kill boss, gather materials, upgrade ship, repeat in next level! But it is bound to change as I understood. I don't know if they drop the boss-thing completely, but there once was talk about progressing through other means as well. For example building a colony that has its own milestones that bring you further.   Bottom line for me: Bought it with public alpha/beta release and I heavily enjoyed the game. Didn't regret a single € spent. I believe StarBound already has many aspects that work well, like the art style and story (only hints as of now, but TASTY hints) and the continued development makes me believe it will become a well rounded, awesome game once release draws near.  EDIT: Stoopid gremmar, duh."

Maybe something like ""Trailer for my new Starbound horror film, Mutagen!"" in the future? Not sure..  Edit: Just remembered I can spread this a little myself, in the news posts..

starbound,3csigk,RelevantAccount,4,Fri Jul 10 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I think you might be right on the title here. I am going to start consulting you about my titles because this is the second time this has happened lol It's very tough posting videos on Reddit anyways. This morning when I posted the video I got a thumbs down on the video in less than 30 seconds, which is shorter than the actual video length. Meaning that in no way could they have viewed it and decided they didn't like it. They just went to the link and thumbs down'd it. But hey, what can you do? I guess it's just part of the whole Youtube thing."
starbound,3csigk,Iristh,2,Fri Jul 10 17:41:25 2015 UTC,It looks really cool. Keep up the good work.
starbound,3csigk,SamuriFerret,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:53:44 2015 UTC,"So it means thart you're gonna add it to Starbound's procedural generation ? That's would be pretty cool if people like you who have such talent could make cool dungeons for the game itself, and maybe add a unique boss and music just for it ! But actually it's more of a mod, isn't it?"
starbound,3csigk,Varixai,3,Fri Jul 10 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the plan for the future is to allow player created content to be dropped into another players universe file so they can play it as well. I already make challenge rooms for ChuckleFish but those are fairly limited in how they can be designed. So hopefully one day in the coming months this dungeon will be able to be dropped in your universe file then you can play it!"
starbound,3csigk,SamuriFerret,7,Fri Jul 10 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Exciting stuff - Nice to see mission mods in progress within the community (Assuming correctly that that's what you're going for). I feel like something like this would benefit from some unique enemy assets, so the player doesn't know what to expect. Perhaps you could get a volunteer to reskin one of the pre-existing bosses as a climax for your dungeon?"
starbound,3csigk,WrethZ,5,Fri Jul 10 18:11:32 2015 UTC,Ideally it would be my own mission. I'll start looking around for someone to maybe reskin some monsters for me. It would definitely be more scary if the player had never seen that monster type before.
starbound,3csigk,TurboGranny,3,Fri Jul 10 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"I think Ixodoom would fit this very well, especially with how that fight starts.  Recoloring it black would probably work, but that boss has soo many sprites.."
starbound,3csigk,TurboGranny,6,Fri Jul 10 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"Ixodoom as it currently is is made up of a bunch of different sprites and has to be triggered by an NPC - Probably the hardest to reskin. Something like the Shockhopper might be easier, though if you made them use the same AI as a regular aggressive monster then you could still make an exciting enough mod boss fight if they were hard enough to defeat."

starbound,3csqaw,MuricanPie,2,Fri Jul 10 14:28:21 2015 UTC,It's been literally years since I looked at this game and people are still repeating this? At this rate I will have to put my Steam key in my will so that my children can play it in my stead when they're old.

Forcing you to use an armour that you won't get your ass beaten in = Even better.  Oh yeah? I died at least 5 times in each dungeon. More in the mech fight."
starbound,3csqaw,MaxiTornado,7,Fri Jul 10 20:06:47 2015 UTC,Linear = Good   Unleeeeeess you're advertised as a sandbox...
starbound,3csqaw,Vox_R,-8,Fri Jul 10 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, but sandboxes suck by their nature, largely due to not having any narrative, so you NEED to have an enclosed storyline, that opens up into a sandbox at the end of it."
starbound,3csqaw,MaxiTornado,5,Sat Jul 11 15:13:55 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure.  There are sandbox games with good narrative.
starbound,3csqaw,hijinks_the_turtle,4,Sat Jul 11 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was just thinking about how horrible the narrative is in fallout NV, the arkham games, elder scrolls, and GTA. /s"
starbound,3csqaw,eamono99,-5,Sat Jul 11 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"I know you're being sarcastic, but everything you listed except GTA made me ""uuuuuuuugh"" a ton during the story missions. And also, you two just proved me right. They have narratives you can play through, and if you're finished, there's still the open world. It's not just like Minecraft where you spawn, and they say: ""Hey, here's a world, do whatever the fuck you want"""
starbound,3csqaw,MaxiTornado,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:25:46 2015 UTC,"IMO a game needs to either be linear or sandbox. If you withhold the sandbox until story completion people will rush the story. But a sandbox game that has no reason to explore because of a linear story is equally bad, like alone in the dark (the reboot).   A great linear game will almost always have a better story than a great sandbox, but that doesn't mean all sandbox games have shit stories and that all linear games have great stories. I like bioshocks story over minecrafts, but I like Witcher 3's over battlefield 4's."
starbound,3csqaw,eamono99,-2,Sat Jul 11 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"Minecraft doesn't have a story at all, and Battlefield is an MMS. These comparisons shouldn't even exist. You see, the problem lies with the audience. Why would you ever ""rush"" a story? That's the best part of the game! Getting a cutscene after hours of soul-grudging gameplay. But somehow, watching a movie still isn't the same."
starbound,3csqaw,MaxiTornado,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that I prefer bioshocks story over minecrafts lack of a story. I'm not sure what an MMS is but BF4 also has a single player campaign that is very linear and story driven, that people rush through because the story is complete ass and beating the story unlocks weapons for the multilayer mode. People rush through pokemon's story because the post game content is better. People rushed through AC3 story because the sandbox doesn't open up until halfway through.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can't just say linear > sandbox, it all depends on the game in question, and the story is not always the best part."
starbound,3csqaw,eamono99,-5,Sat Jul 11 22:29:47 2015 UTC,"MINECRAFT DOESN'T HAVE A FUCKING STORY!!!!!!! JESUS CHRIST, DO YOU EVEN HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?!! I, I give up. You people are dense."
starbound,3csqaw,MaxiTornado,3,Sat Jul 11 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"NEED? No. Examples of games that have done well as sandboxes without a giant enclosed storyline that leads into an open world:   Minecraft Terraria EVE Online GTA (storylines can be skipped entirely) The X Series Elite: Dangerous Freelancer Planetside 2   And others. Now, if you need to have an enclosed storyline, that's an entirely different story and understandable; the only one who can determine that is you.  Does a game NEED to have an enclosed storyline in order to be successful?  In a word, no."
starbound,3csqaw,Vox_R,-4,Sat Jul 11 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Minecraft loses it's fun factor without mods within days. Terraria is boring as hell in my opinion, EVE is... EVE. It doesn't matter that you can skip it, it's still there, never heard of the X series, Elite: Dangerous is a multiplayer game, never heard of Freelancer either, and I never played Planetside, So I've no idea what it's like. Yes, it does. Otherwise it's not a game, it's just a ""do things simulator""."
starbound,3csqaw,MaxiTornado,4,Sat Jul 11 17:28:54 2015 UTC,"In my opinion   Highlighted the important aspect of the whole conversation, considering a few things:   Minecraft is one of the most successful video games of all time. 12 million users of Terraria would disagree with your assessment. 500,000 players of EVE Online would disagree. Elite is a single player game with multiplayer aspects (and why does that matter? Every other game you just spoke about save for the X Series is multiplayer)    Otherwise it's not a game, it's just a ""do things simulator"".   Yeah, it's not worth continuing this. You've got your fingers in your ears. You're not interested in discussion or learning, you're interested in being right. Too bad, too; you're really missing out on some great games."
starbound,3csqaw,Vox_R,-7,Sat Jul 11 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not by the fucking law, so I can't really say that.  Minecraft would be nothing without mods.  Terraria is only popular because the bunch of 80's gamers that grew up want to play games with sh- I mean pixelated graphics again.  500000 for an online game? Yes, I know it seems like a big number, but it isn't. Especially for a free one.  I have absolutely no fucking clue what you mean by this.  ... It's not about being right, it's about defending your opinion. If you give in you lose. If you lose, you're dead inside. Simple as that."

These are all your opinions, not fact. Sure, you don't like sandbox games, that doesn't mean they suck by nature. Games don't need an enclosed storyline to be a good game. Also, what is and isn't a game is not your decision.  Your original comment reflects on how linear progression and being locked into a set of armor is something you appreciate. Someone replies about how they feel otherwise, stating information provided by the very game developers themselves. That's where your argument spirals down by replacing fact and evidence entirely with opinion.  Berating a game and displaying your opinion does not dismiss the irrefutable evidence that the stated games are objectively successful.  Finally,   ... It's not about being right, it's about defending your opinion.   Almost the entire sense of your arguments are about being right and not about your defense of your opinion that linear games are objectively more fun than sandbox games. They are all attacks of sandbox games."

starbound,3csqaw,dsp2003,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"That's basically what the armor requirement does. Its making sure you have good enough armor to do the mission, which as a result sets a bar for a health level."

""completionConditions"" : [     { ""type"" : ""gather"", ""tag"" : ""steelarmor"", ""consume"" : false } ],   It explicitly forces you to obtain certain type of armour (which can be exploited by crafting only a single piece of it - a helmet, for example), when in fact the same effect could be achieved by getting more pieces of less advanced armour."
starbound,3csqaw,dsp2003,2,Mon Jul 13 05:18:00 2015 UTC,Might want to go take a look at the stats of armors. Each tier better than the last. The steal body armor is almost superior to the entire iron set.  http://starbounder.org/Defector%27s_Set http://starbounder.org/Rebel%27s_Set  You physically can not achieve the steel armor stats with the iron tier armor.
starbound,3csqaw,lazarus78,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:47:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is nobody actually says about the armour in particular - there are plenty of other items which act like an armour, and giving the RNG of Starbound, there's a great probability to obtain one which would fit the criteria. :)"
starbound,3csqaw,dsp2003,2,Mon Jul 13 07:27:01 2015 UTC,"Like what? Armor isn't randomly generated. Shields can block but are not armor.  And IIRC the armor requirement tag is supposed to be only on the chest armor, so the steel and titanium armors having the tag on all of the armor parts I believe is an oversight. Because Tier 4 and up armors only have the tag on the chest armors."

None of that information was supplied in the post I responded to, and you aren't the OP so why are you responding to me like I've insulted you somehow?  Also, Starbound.log is a text file that is automatically generated when the game is ran, so there is no extra scripts necessary to make it appear.

Multiplay is actually a dedicated game server host, so with them you just buy it and they have a Stable branch starbound server ready to go.

God dammit Mrs. K, I understood you five minutes ago what's today's homework  Saying the second helps with confirming is like saying that when sending a letter, you should send two copies, one entirely in lower case and the other in all caps, in order to make sure the recipient understands what you're saying. The only likely scenario in which doing so would actually help the recipient understand you is if the recipient fails to understand your letter the first time through, and at the same time is actually stupid enough to fail to realize he can just read one copy twice."

Option 1: Constantly make back ups on your character and if he ever dies, just load up the saved file.  Option 2: Since all Starbound characters share the same universe, you could create a new character and travel to your main characters home planet and inherit all his stuff."
starbound,3cqwqr,quiqksilver,2,Fri Jul 10 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, as /u/quiqksilver said, the universe is the same for all characters you make. So, if anything, using this character you have on Hardcore, move all their best items to the first planet you started on, make a new character on Casual or Normal, and run over to that chest and pick it all up. (I believe that all characters you make start on the same planet, correct me if I'm wrong)  The big issues I can see with this are that you'd have to go through and defeat all the bosses again, and you'd also have to redo all the quests back up to that point and some of 'em can just be a bit of a hassle to redo (finding that moon emblem = not fun). Also, if you want your tech back, you'd have to look for new Blank Tech Cards, which, in my experience, I mostly found on the surface so you may have to travel to a few new planets too.  If it were me, I'd just make a completely new character since I enjoy coming up with new personas, but I understand what it's like getting too attached to one too!

starbound,3cqwqr,DangerQuinn,2,Fri Jul 10 05:01:06 2015 UTC,"There IS a way to change mode of your character. You'll need to decode the player file with supplied dump_versioned_json command-line utility. It's used like this (substitute ""xxx"" with desired filename):   dump_versioned_json xxx.player xxx.json   Next, open decoded .json file with text editor, find variable ""modeType"" : ""hardcore"" and change it to ""modeType"" : ""casual"" or ""modeType"" : ""normal"".  IMPORTANT: Next, search the .json file for ""NaN"" directive and, if found, replace it with 0, otherwise you won't be able to reassemble edited file back into .player (it's a bug yet to be fixed at CF's side).  When you'll finish editing your character file, use make_versioned_json utility:   make_versioned_json xxx.json xxx.player   Hope this helps. :)"

starbound,3cq74a,obake84,7,Thu Jul 9 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"Rarity is not tied to planet difficulty, however the level is. Each generated weapon has a level that corresponds with the planet tier. (You can see the tiers here)  So, if you got it on a max tier planet then it is probably level 6. (which it probably is, since 800 dps is right around the max currently)  The rarity makes it more powerful among the same level, so a common level 6 wouldn't have nearly as much damage as a legendary level 6. But as puzzledmint mentioned, a common level 6 would be much more powerful than a legendary level 1.    By the way, in the next Stable update all of this won't matter as much. The level/rarity structure will stay the same, but all the stats got squished. Your armor will contain the true power, not the weapons.  They did this so that you can find a unique tier 2 legendary weapon and still have it be somewhat useful at tier 6."

Where you just press down while standing on a platform to drop through?  I agree that would make traversing platforms a little faster, but the difference is that Starbound has crouching and Terraria does not. If it worked so that just pressing down on a platform made you fall through it would be impossible to crouch while you were on a platform."

The quest system in particular irks me because it just doesn't fit the whole 2d exploration theme going around already.
starbound,3ckbtr,Nidmorr,-3,Wed Jul 8 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? The quest system is the single best thing in the entire game. I just hope they won't go full RPG syndrome, and start adding side-quests. Uuuuuugh."
starbound,3ckbtr,MaxiTornado,2,Wed Jul 8 23:59:23 2015 UTC,... There... are side quests. That's what most of the quests are. Technically the only quests that aren't side quests are the one that lead up to boss fights.
starbound,3ckbtr,Crallium,-2,Thu Jul 9 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"No, because you need to do those quests to get to the next bosses. I really like the tier system, and would hate to see it turn into an experience point grind-fest."
starbound,3ckbtr,MaxiTornado,3,Thu Jul 9 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"Apex: Heals slightly faster from basic food (food that only heals you and feeds you, but doesn't give you any other bonus)  Avian: Slight increase in ranged weapon damage.  Floran: Slow heal while in normal water. It's negated while drowning, slower than healing water, and slightly slower than sleeping in a bed.   Glitch: Slight increase in armor damage threshold.   Human: Slight increase in melee weapon damage.  Hylotl: Slightly faster movement under water. Possibly no drowning underwater.   Novakid: Light aura. Dimmer than using the lantern stick, possibly matching the Novakid's color.  I tried to make these all early game advantages. Mid-Late game, you don't want any of these advantages affecting gameplay style. The slightly higher jump can be negated with jump boost or rocket boots but that's a choice, not a permanent effect. The slight increases to damage/damge threshold are so minute that they affect early game a little bit but once you get into bigger numbers, the small advantage means nothing. Hylotl not drowning underwater (or maybe just taking longer to drown underwater) is actually fine because all of the suits allow you to breath underwater, and while it's a choice to wear a suit, it's basically completely needed late game, and you get suits pretty early in the game. Also you don't really need the ability early in the game honestly so it's not really a reason to pick the race, it's just a little extra thing. I've always thought the Novakid aura thing should be true. This is what I think though."

starbound,3ckbtr,sayterdarkwynd,5,Wed Jul 8 17:59:06 2015 UTC,"eh, I disagree. Make each bonus it's own thing, suited to particular playstyles or negating a minor inconvenience and it makes it a worthwhile thing to have. One simply needs to make the bonus in-line with all the other races.  ie: 5% jump bonus for avians, but a 5% walk speed bonus for humans. Glitch, on the other hand, have a 5% increase to melee damage, while Novakids get 5% to ranged damage...that sort of thing."
starbound,3ckbtr,lazarus78,2,Wed Jul 8 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"So Novakids would be ""best"" because they get a bonus to the most widely used weapon type in the game.  If its worth while, its unbalanced.

This would a) translate the style really well and b) give authors the freedom to actually go wild with the material while still having the means to formulate an ongoing plot.  Also this would really benefit character development because individual main characters could have an establishing episode to really focus on them and longer sub plots might play out over multiple episodes.  This way, official established characters like Hewlett Deckard, Hiraki Corale and the like might get some cameo screen time, while the ""Big Bad""(s) of the universe don't need to be offed in a rush. Think of Darth Vade in SW: What if that guy was introduced and finished off in just one movie? And SB has plenty evil characters of the same magnitude.  Over several seasons you could thus address all the conflicts in SB's lore.  Season 1 might deal with the human exodus after the tentacomet incident, while season 2 gets deeper into the mysteries surrounding Kluex and his space station above Avos.  Of course, as the only truly ""alien"" race, the titular hero HAS to be a Novakid! ;-)  Let's face it: If anything Starbound is a better fit for a serialised format."

This bit here:   They keep posting little updates to things like wiring and about systems that they are polishing, but there's no movement on actual progression etc.   The devs have said outright that they know Starbound is a bit content light right now, but they're still refining the systems in the game before they really dive into that stuff.  Bigger content updates are coming, but they probably won't be for a while.  If I had to guess, I'd say they're still probably 6 to 12 months out, but that's just my hunch."

starbound,3chn37,ProudToDrown,3,Wed Jul 8 03:55:26 2015 UTC,It's a Sandbox game. You make what you want of it. My favorite thing was going through the tiers and crafting all types of things to make my house better.
starbound,3chn37,ProudToDrown,3,Wed Jul 8 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"From your description I'm not entirely sure if you're swapping planets yet, though it certainly sounds like you haven't gone to the outpost yet.

starbound,3chspp,cratesmith,2,Wed Jul 8 00:39:09 2015 UTC,"Recently got into starbound, but the game seems to be really missing features in the wiring/automation department. I read there was a mod to do all this called Starfoundry but apparently the mod is outdated with the author awol.   So I'm playing with a basic API for objects to send items/liquids to others. I'm mostly just building it for my own purposes of having automated item sorting in my base. Right now it's just about 5 hours work, untested + experimental."
starbound,3chspp,astraltor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:43:18 2015 UTC,"the authors are present but they're generally busy doing other things.  in fact, 2 of the (main?) contributors have since been inducted to code on starbound!  they're still well alive though and are easily reachable most (week)days on the starbound modding channel on freenode. link. reponse may be slow so keep the tab open.  edit: that mod's looking good so far :D"
starbound,3chspp,Varixai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"A small correction: There were many authors behind Starfoundry, and many are still around. Two of the main authors are now Starbound developers. (metadept and healthire, the first 2 on the contributor list for it)  That those 2 are now developers actually contributes to Starfoundry going without updates as far as I can tell. Many of Starfoundry's features are coming to the core game. With that in mind, they have devoted their time to the ""normal"" game development instead of Starfoundry, since they will eventually be working on those features for the core game anyways.    With all that said, it is cool that you are experimenting with things. And yea the Starfoundry mod page could use an update and maybe some author permissions for other people to build on their work.    Edit: As astraltor mentioned while I was typing this, many of the authors are active daily on the mod IRC channel (mentioned on the mod page)"

We met so many lovely people at Minecon — if you were one of them, it was an an absolute pleasure to meet you! Events are fun. :D  Minecon photo [JPG]  Today, Tccoxon and Healthire have been doing some work on NPC reactions.  Kyren has been working on performance stuff, and Metadept has been working on terrain. Specifically, he’s trying to improve blending between different sectors and reduce the number of caves on the surface. He’s sent over some images from the utility he’s using to do this, and it’s… trippy.  Trippy blending [PNG]  ‘Til tomorrow! <3 <3     Edit: A word."

starbound,3ciwvi,justbeast,5,Wed Jul 8 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"This comes up frequently in here.  The devs might have made some kind of statement about it, but if they did, I didn't see it.  If so, maybe someone can remember what they said.  If not, I'd really like to see a developer response, even if it's just ""it's not a priority right now, but we'll get it in by 1.0""."
starbound,3ciwvi,nerfviking,-2,Wed Jul 8 19:41:25 2015 UTC,What do you need pause for? To be safe? Just beam to ship
starbound,3ciwvi,UnstoppableHypocrite,8,Wed Jul 8 07:11:04 2015 UTC,"No, in case I get called away while I'm in the middle of something and need to put it on hold for a bit."
starbound,3ciwvi,GenDekker,-1,Wed Jul 8 07:13:11 2015 UTC,"Save and quit. The new patch basically made it so you start off exactly where you were when you quit. Before you would instantly be put back on your ship but not anymore. So it's not pause, but it's just as good. Have to step away? Save and Quit. Then when you come back, you'll still be in the Main Menu so just load up your character and you'll be right where you left off.  Takes like 2 seconds. Get called away? ESCAPE then SAVE & QUIT. Boom done, go do your business. Your game gets put in the main menu. Ready to come back? Select SP, then your character. BOOM, you're back in the game. No more complaining. Easy peasy, now you can play.  If you're still gonna complain about having to Save and Quit, then just put blocks all around your character so you dont die to random enemies and then walk away to do what you have to do."
starbound,3ciwvi,dsp2003,10,Wed Jul 8 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"There's a catch, though. Save & Quit in temporary worlds, such as mission dungeons or challenge rooms will lead you to end up on the ship instead - these are impossible to resume since their instances are only stored in-memory and cached for about 10 minutes when the server is running."
starbound,3ciwvi,Artie-Choke,14,Wed Jul 8 07:46:03 2015 UTC,Save and quit is a BS excuse for not having a proper pause function built into the single player game and I wish people would stop making excuses for CF leaving out this most basic function.
starbound,3ciwvi,lazarus78,-7,Wed Jul 8 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"Pause, save and quit, whats the difference? It achieves the same thing either way. It's not a ""basic function"", its a convenience function. No need to reinvent the wheel and call it by a different name when we already have a perfectly functioning wheel."
starbound,3ciwvi,nerfviking,7,Wed Jul 8 16:38:06 2015 UTC,"In every other modern single player game, escape is enough to pause, and a lot of us have a habit of just pressing escape and assuming the game is paused (especially since the menu is visible).  I have kids.  Sometimes I have to pause my game quickly.  Sometimes I don't have time to think ""oh yeah, this is starbound, you can't effing pause it for some reason"" and save my game.  Then I come back and my dude is dead.  Starbound could really use a pause feature.  The lack thereof is hugely frustrating.  I understand that the game is still in development, and that the devs have other priorities right now, but what I don't get is people outright dismissing the request and calling it ""the same as saving your game"" when it clearly is not.  By the time they hit 1.0, the game really really needs a pause function in single player."
starbound,3ciwvi,lazarus78,-3,Wed Jul 8 19:39:45 2015 UTC,"""In every other modern single player game...""  I play several single player games that have no pause feature, or if they have one, its rarely used.  I have a kid too. If I am needed, pausing a game is the least of my concerns. Its a game. Boo hoo. You must have never played Dark Souls. Pausing... ha!... Games not pausing is becoming more common place too I've noticed."
starbound,3ciwvi,nerfviking,5,Thu Jul 9 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"I never have, although you'll have to excuse my lack of pedantry.   In the vast majority of modern single player games   There.   I have a kid too. If I am needed, pausing a game is the least of my concerns. Its a game. Boo hoo.   I say the game needs a pause feature and your rebuttal is that you think I'm a bad parent because I like to pause my game when I get up to change a diaper?"
starbound,3ciwvi,lazarus78,-2,Thu Jul 9 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"Did i say you were a bad parent? Please don't put words in my mouth.  There are plenty of games out there without pause features, like Kerbal Space Program and Intersteller Rift, and of course, Dark Souls.  The fact of the matter is, a pause feature in starbound isn't that huge of a deal. quitting to main menu take a single second longer than a pause feature, or putting a box around yourself takes 2 seconds longer. You are making it sound like a pause will save you soo much time, when in reality, it won't."
starbound,3ciwvi,nerfviking,4,Thu Jul 9 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"If you think it's a time issue, you didn't read my comment very carefully.  It's a habit issue, and that habit comes from the fact that the vast majority of single player games on the PC will pause when you hit escape (the console equivalent being the start button).  The menu pops up, and in my haste I believe the game is paused, and then I go off and come back to find my character dead.  That's a UI problem, because it doesn't act the way a typical user would reasonably expect it to."
starbound,3ci5bx,Explodingcamel,2,Wed Jul 8 02:24:46 2015 UTC,You need the correlating protection suit Techs.  You get them by progressing through the game's quest line (the specific quests are linked to on the wiki page I linked above). Almost all of the quests are required to progress through each tier.    I recently listed a bunch of other major changes that catch people by surprise here.
starbound,3ci5bx,Varixai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, if you haven't already, you'd have to equip the suit by talking to S.A.I.L. The first one is for radiation, I think, so it allows you to go to planets that have descriptions that say something along the lines of, ""High amounts of radiation.""  But, if you mean the enemies are too tough to handle at the moment, I would go to the ""hardest"" planet I could just barely handle, mark the spawn point with a visible block (I use oddly colored dirt), and run in one direction across the whole planet. Although there will usually by mini-biomes with themed items, you're almost certain to find better weapons in surface chests. Depending on your dodging skills (or in my case - ability to quickly use bandages), combat is much easier along with improved weapons even if you don't have the resources for better armor yet.   If that's too difficult (which happened to me a lot when I first started replaying), I usually just spend all my pixels in any way I can (usually for flares), and go on a new planet and dig straight down until you find something that can help you out (e.g. ores for armor, weapons, blank tech cards). Getting back up... you could use wooden platforms or just fill in the hole, but I play on Casual and usually just find a way to kill my character so I don't use up resources returning to ship, whoops.   Ehhh I rambled a bit and I'm not sure if I even answered your question correctly, but please let me know if you need clarification on anything!"
starbound,3ci5bx,Featherfell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:44:54 2015 UTC,I thought the suit was only supposed to provide oxygenation? Or did I get another one without realizing it? But the enemies aren't the problem.
starbound,3ci5bx,Featherfell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:51:12 2015 UTC,"The suit with the O2 symbol only provides oxygen, but you'll get another suit with a radiation symbol which both protects you fro radioactive planets AND provides oxygen. You should get it from a quest at the outpost where you collect 300 kelp from an ocean planet, I think!"

starbound,3cawzx,Ilorin_Lorati,45,Mon Jul 6 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about color blindness, my apologies! Some kind of pattern recognition may be a better idea instead of colors."
starbound,3cawzx,k2trf,9,Mon Jul 6 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"Patterns and/or Shapes is definatly the best idea(s), however you could also simply label the colors.  Just because colorblind people can't percieve different colors doesn't mean they won't know that red+yellow=orange or yellow+blue=green.  If nothing else, this would work short term, until you have the time to alter the shapes/patterns, since labels (signs) are easy."
starbound,3cawzx,cecilkorik,11,Mon Jul 6 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"Actually just adding colors in general should be avoided. There are several different color models, and the addition of two colors can give quite different results depending which color model you're using. Does red + green = brown, or yellow? Depends on what color model you're talking about."
starbound,3cawzx,k2trf,6,Mon Jul 6 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Ah fair point; for a simple system like this, using only primaries and secondaries, it would be easy enough from a logic standpoint, but anything more complicated would get problematic."

starbound,3cawzx,Varixai,3,Mon Jul 6 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, usually to account for colorblindness you would combine color with patterns at the same time (make patterns with the paint). That way people can go by either."

starbound,3ce7wh,BradCraeb,0,Tue Jul 7 13:22:29 2015 UTC,I think procedural generation is shit. Nothing ever looks good except environments.   Also infinite procedural with no new fun things would be extremely dull.
starbound,3ce7wh,Rainb0wcrash99,5,Tue Jul 7 07:24:42 2015 UTC,"I think that procedural generation can be terrible, but done well it really works. A good step in the right direction, in my opinion, would be to seriously reduce the number of planets, but make them much larger, with multiple places to beam down to.   In general, procgen only works well when the playable area is limited to a size the generator can fill with nonrepetitve content. I feel that so many games (Minecraft, for example) get this wrong by making the world infinite. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should."

It's just often done in a ""looks close enough"" kind of way that is orders of magnitude simpler than modeling the real thing and working off of that.

This has been my opinion and we're seeing ever more use of that 'buzz word'.  In my eye, it's a cop-out in world/level design and there are always downgrade compromises we have to live with when a game relies on coding rather than a true game designer working it.  It's a cheap way out of putting real talent to work and the game and players are worse off for it."
starbound,3ce7wh,Artie-Choke,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"For games like these, you cannot hire a world/level designer since the very core of the game is to have randomness and limitless zones. A level designer might design hundreds of nice ""wildcard zones"" that each biomes alter in some ways, but it would still be the same hundreds over and over.  While with procedural generation, it allows an almost infinite number of dull or similar patterns, but has the possibility of almost infinite outstanding places"

All it does is take a program I've written and load it into RAM before the CPU begins its work.  On ""real"" computers, this is a more complicated task, because data is often stored on media that themselves require some work to access.  For example, if you've ever used a boot USB stick, you've benefited from your computer's bootloader, which gives your computer the know-how to access data via the USB standard so that it can load more interesting things, like an operating system.  The RAM, unlike the bootloader, is dynamic; the data in RAM is frequently written and re-written by programs (which also reside in RAM).  On real computers, RAM is also much, much faster to access than long-term storage media, like hard disks and solid state disks.  The flipside of its speed is that it's relatively large per byte stored and goes blank as soon as the computer is turned off."

starbound,3c6yll,Nidmorr,3,Sun Jul 5 17:34:27 2015 UTC,no.  Chances of villages (villages are considered dungeons) are set by the planet type (scorched/lush/forest/ocean etc...); all of them have 0 to 1. Short of modifying the game the best one can do is use the chance game of picking a world that has a smaller list of possible dungeon types to make it more likely that the glitch village shows up.  There is a reddit post listing all the planetary biomes and possible dungeons and here's the data copied from the assets.

Here are some of the changes that commonly catch people by surprise:   There was a universe wipe when the massive January 2015 patch hit. There are no more sectors, everything is on the same map. The Matter Manipulator is now your main tool, pickaxes are just 1 use boosts until you fully upgrade your MM. No Hunger or Temperature at the moment, but on higher level planets you need tech suits to survive. You get those tech suits and almost all other upgrades just by going through the quest line. Almost every single quest is required before the game lets you get to the next tier, no matter how trivial the quest seems.   Here's some links to help you get up to speed on the other major changes:   Massive Stable January Patch Notes Overview Big Stable Update in April (another overview) Version History on the official wiki   The official wiki is quite up to date too, you can check it if you have small questions, there's a 95% chance they are answered there in detail."

starbound,3c2mdv,Megido_,2,Sat Jul 4 10:11:07 2015 UTC,I'm still kinda baffled and unsure of what exactly all this means.  Could somone ELI5 it? :P  What is the practical use of any of this?  Why would anyone WANT to build this?
starbound,3c2mdv,crazyweaselbob,8,Sat Jul 4 11:56:47 2015 UTC,"Let me see if I can explain, ELI5 style.  Basically, whenever a game gets complex enough to have anything resembling wiring or switches, engineer-types will try to build increasingly complex digital circuits using only in-game components and running on in-game ""physics"".   It starts out simple enough - ""when I flip this switch, that light turns on over there"". (You can do that super-easy in Starbound right now, just takes a wire, a switch and a light. See http://starbounder.org/Wiring ). Then you can add some ""either/or"" logic to the switches, sort of like dual switches in many people's real-world houses, where you can turn on the light either by flipping the switch in the hallway, or in the living room.   Pretty soon (with only a few kinds of in-game widgets such as switches, wires, gates and timers), it turns out that you can make  arbitrarily complex digital circuits, in-game. From simple calculators, all the way to general-purpose computers.   And actually, it takes shockingly few kinds of switches (along with a whoooooole lot of patience) to be able to simulate a general purpose computing device. It only takes some AND, NOT and OR switches (although having a few other widgets, such as delays and timers, helps). (If you're curious about this topic, take a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4908893/what-logic-gates-are-required-for-turing-completeness or read Building a Modern Computer from First Principles).  Sidenote: Although this is counter-intuitive to most people, it turns out that computers are an abstract idea, rather than specific physical devices that we use to read Reddit.  In the 19th and early 20th century, mathematicians and philosophers realized (and then proved) that certain kinds of imaginary machines (which you could simulate using pen and paper) could be used to do any kind of computation you could want. And I mean any kind of computation. Arithmetic? Yep, these machines could do it. Algebra? Yes. How about Logic and Boolean Algebra? That too! And hey, once you have arithmetic and boolean algebra and such, it's only a short way to being able to calculate ballistic firing tables for the World War 2 militaries (such as the 1946 ENIAC - which was also used to help test the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb!), crunch numbers for small businesses, play games, send email, and have a few DotCom bubbles.  What do I mean by ""imaginary machines""? Well, Alan Turing in his famous 1936 paper (with a gnarly-ass title ""On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem""), described a hypothetical device that was able to read and write symbols on an infinite tape. And the symbols would tell the device, in simple terms, what to do next -- to roll the tape backwards or forwards, to read more symbols, or to write other ones. And went on to prove that using this machine, you could do any sort of calculation or computation that you would want. These type of machines came to be known as ""Turing Machines"". And the notion that it only takes a few capabilities and a few rules for a machine to be able to perform any computation, came to be called Turing completeness.   The upshot of all of this, though, is that in theory, it doesn't matter what a computer is made out of, as long as it can follow a few simple rules. Given enough time, any machine that is Turing Complete can perform the same types of calculations. Whether it's made out of integrated circuits, or water pipes, or gears and punchcards like the Analytical Engine, or pencil and paper, or even... wires and logic gates inside a video game.  In practice, of course it matters -- your modern laptop or iPad will be billions of times faster than a Turing machine that you run on a bunch of graph paper, using a pencil. But that's not the point -- the only difference between all those kinds of computers is their speed (whether it takes seconds or years to crunch the same numbers). A real-world computer is equivalent to a turing machine running inside Conway's Game of Life, which is equivalent to a virtual computers inside Minecraft, and finally, equivalent to virtual computers inside Starbound (once people like the original poster actually create them).  Aaanyways, to get back to your original question - What is the practical use of building computers inside computers? And why do people WANT to do this?  Well, developers usually add wiring and switches and gates to a game, in order for players and modders to be able to create neat in-game structures. Like lights and doors that open with switches. Or Airlocks, or defense turrets, or elevators. Then people like https://www.reddit.com/user/quiqksilver start using this wiring to create clever traps and dungeons. (And then subsequently get hired by developers to create dungeons for the official game). That makes sense so far, right? But in a way, those devices (airlocks and turrets and dungeons) are actually simple computers.  So the first answer to ""what is the practical use"" is - to build cool things in the game.  Now, why do people take it wayyyy too far, and labor for hours and days and months to actually build general-purpose Universal Turing Machines inside video games? To the point where they have models of iPhones built out of Minecraft blocks, or even simple versions of Minecraft running on a Minecraft-powered computers? (Check out Mineception in http://www.businessinsider.com/virtual-computers-built-inside-minecraft-2015-2?op=1 ).   That bit is easy, too -- for the sheer joy of ""because they can"". To show off their cleverness, to show that it can be done, for art in general, and out of boredom. For the same reason people want to build a Difference Engine out of LEGOs.   Maybe there's a metaphysical aspect to it, too, maybe the universe just wants infinite layers of computers-within-computers. But more likely? Simply for Lulz."

One of the workers had said they'd heard some strange sounds a short while ago. When the news reached him, he had to go and investigate. He got to the locked door, and placed his hand on the scanner. It slid open.  ""I'm going alone from here on. Wait until I get back."" He said. The rest of his companions didn't know why, but they listened.  As he cross the threshold, he could smell the stench. It weighed heavily on the air. When he turned on his flashlight, he could see there was slime dripping from the ceiling, pooling on the ground. There was no mistaking it. Something was alive down here.  He kept walking, unsure of what was behind the next door. The flickering fluorescent light only served to set his nerves more on edge. He got to the door and clicked the switch. His flashlight shone on an empty cocoon, with even more of the foul slime coating the entire room. He could barely stand the smell.  He accidentally kicked something, and it flew forward, but rather than hitting the cocoon, it fell down. He aimed his flashlight at the gaping hole in front of him. It was covered in a fresh layer of slime. The tunnel was dug very recently. He swallowed hard. Knowing there was now something on the loose...  Great work man. Love seeing your stuff. It always makes me want to play and try stuff on my own. However there's always something getting in the way.

I've used eight eight-bit shift registers; for Life, you'd need a 2d array of two-bit shift registers (one for the buffer, one for the screen).  I used an eight-bit ripple counter for my clock, but you could use fewer bits for Life.  The multiplexing would be a nightmare, though.  For an eight-by-eight screen, you'd need sixty-four eight-bit multiplexers to feed a bunch of bit adders to decide whether or not a cell lived or died.  Then you'd need to demux that signal across the entire buffer.  I'm going to see about making a tiny general purpose computer, first.  It certainly won't have the memory to run Life in software, at least not at first.  But it'd be nice to get a little more variety for the same material investment.

starbound,3c27ob,justbeast,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"Quest should be OPTIONAl and TRANSPARENT, quests should not be REQUIERED in order to progress in the game  The whole purpose of a sandox game is to be free to progress in the manner we want, without being guided by a NPC or a quest system  It's hard to explain in my non native language, but the reason i play sandbox games is because i don't want the game to dictate me how to play"

Because the current setup is not very different. Aside from the Bug Hunt quest, which is required for the first boss mission (and which, I agree, is kind of dumb, for it to be required), the rest of the boss missions only require you to have gotten a particular kind of armor."

starbound,3bvwdr,Rainb0wcrash99,3,Thu Jul 2 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"Their lore is that they are forgetful and therefore don't make a lot of scientific progress, so I think it makes sense that common run-of-the-mill furniture is pretty basic.  Then again, they do have train spaceships :P"

So they don't really know how stuff they personally didn't make works, so progress halts at a point where they can't copy something easily. And get bored."
starbound,3bvwdr,MaxiTornado,2,Thu Jul 2 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"Well it doesn't really matter what the original suggestion was because in the game the lore is that they have short memory and attention spans, so technology doesn't advance very fast. You can read it on the wiki, if you want to."
starbound,3bvwdr,SupaSlide,2,Thu Jul 2 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and now you go back to the wiki, scroll down and read all the neat-o stuff, that puts the ""forgetfulness"" aspect into perspective.  And then you will see that /u/MaxiTornado was quite right with his statement.  Somehow a Novakid PC HAS to be able to tinker up some spacetight jalopy, else it would have little sense to assume one would actually possess one at the beginning at all.

starbound,3buczb,TanzNukeTerror,3,Thu Jul 2 11:27:54 2015 UTC,"People constantly ask this, and the only real answer is: When the Developers release it.  They're still working on a bunch of stuff, and will release a Stable update when they feel it's an appropriate time.  I would say within the next month or so, but it's totally up to them. Just be patient.~ Delete your whole universe and all your characters, and see how long you can go without upgrading your ship. That's what I'm doing, and I'm loving just building little houses or whatever. c:"
starbound,3buczb,EinherjarofOdin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:51:18 2015 UTC,How often do the devs update the game? I've had this on my wishlist for a long time now because I'm not very sure about early access games. It looks amazing but I dunno.
starbound,3buczb,Varixai,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:57:33 2015 UTC,"2-3 months between major updates is the current schedule schedule they are aiming for.  You can see their past update history on the official wiki here, and what's coming in the next update here.  I would definitely suggest the game, however you do have some time still until it is released. So you can wait for it to go on sale if you like. It was 30% off in the Steam summer sale last month, and they usually go 25-30% off for really big updates like last January."
starbound,3buczb,EinherjarofOdin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:17:58 2015 UTC,"Gonna grab it next big update then, if it keeps it up 'cause I had read they didn't update it frequently."
starbound,3buczb,Varixai,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:41:53 2015 UTC,"There is no official eta, but my best guess is about 4 to 6 weeks. 2 or 3 weeks from now we should have a much more accurate estimate.  As for playing, if you actually want to play the game, I would suggest Stable or Unstable. (Unstable is the same as Stable right now though, it will just get the update a little faster)  The Nightly is really just for seeing and testing out the new features, not ""normal"" gameplay. For example, if you start a new character on the Nightly you won't be on a normal starting planet; you will be on a Snow planet, which doesn't have Iron, thus preventing you from progressing past the first planet without using an admin command to give yourself Iron.

Sectors were done away with in favor of a unified universe, which contains five different kinds of solar systems: Gentle, Eccentric, Radioactive, Frozen, and Firey. Gentle ones are the ""starter"" tier systems, and Firey are the highest tiered ones. Planet difficulty per system, and biome distribution (to which difficulty is tied at the moment), differs between system type.  It's rather hard to explain in text for me.

The enemies are all the same."
starbound,3btztp,Medane,2,Thu Jul 2 12:18:29 2015 UTC,"I absolutely disagree.  Call me basic but the overall aesthetic design of Terraria, and the lack of any actual lore (as far as I can tell) just leaves me utterly bored and completely uninvested into the gameplay.  It looked to be all progress and get items.  While Starbound doesn't have much, the design was enough for me to be hooked on, in addition to a bunch of other mods.  Progression is far from perfected in Starbound, but it's serviceable in my opinion."

Remember that you have to install the ""Starbound - Unstable"" game on Steam though, and then change the properties on that one to Nightly.  As for reset, if you copy over your player and universe folders from your Stable game nothing will be reset.  Another thing to remember about Nightly though is that it is not for ""normal"" gameplay, just seeing and testing out the new features. For example, if you start a new character on the Nightly you won't be on a normal starting planet; you will be on a Snow planet, which doesn't have Iron, thus preventing you from progressing past the first planet without using an admin command to give yourself Iron."

starbound,3brsuh,riscles,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:15:21 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have already mentioned the water pit, but I found a useful way to go down a shaft if for some reason you don't have a water pit at the bottom. I place a water block in the shaft and then jump down into it while it is still very close to me. While holding your down key (so to go through any platforms you may have in the way) and your jump key (so to stay floating on the water), you should slowly go down with the water all the way down and reach the bottom. I like to use this in really deep mine shafts where you can't just place a lot of water to fill up a hole at the bottom because if the water gets too far away from you it, it kind of despawns/stops in place and you have to get near it for it to keep going down, so not 100% useful when you jump down and just fall through the water half way down, then die of fall damage. I use this when I die mining and forgot to add the water pit or back when the game didn't keep your location when you quit so you had to find a way back down."

The game itself is actually DRM free, so there is nothing stopping them from putting them up for download on their side, however, I find it very unlikely for them to do that. Few games actually offer old dated versions. The prevailing mentality is ""Why should we?"", and rightly so. Why would a developer want to perpetuate old versions and try to offer support on them?

starbound,3bsc5u,lazarus78,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"I never meant they needed to support them, or do anything really. Steam itself would keep a revision history of a few updates back, so players could play an old version if the newest has a critical bug, or just if they fancy. Of course they wouldn't support legacy versions, I wouldn't expect them to. Just having some way of downgrading would be nice.   Its a waste of time.

Undoubtedly people will post about bug and issues that have long since been resolved. There is no reason for them to offer old versions. If they did their job properly, then there should be no game crippeling bugs in the stable version, which Starbound has been exceedingly stable in my experience. Even if there were, there would be no reason to offer Koala versions when they could just go back 1 version to wait out for the bug to be fixed. That is the reason they have Nightly and Unstable, so that Stable is actually... stable.  Minecraft is a bad example of this. Most of their userbase is fixated on 1.7 because mod makers are generally too lazy to update to 1.8. If they forced updates, then it forces the community to move up as well and they state of the game wouldn't be so bleak."

Undoubtedly people will post about bug and issues that have long since been resolved.    Have mods be watching for these type of posts, and remove them. I think you overestimate the amount of people that will downgrade, and most who do will be smart enough to realise that it's an old version, and won't be fixed.   If they did their job properly, then there should be no game crippeling bugs in the stable version   Of course, in an ideal world, that would be the case, however, devs are human, and humans aren't perfect. The reverting acts as a failsafe, in case of issues.    Most of their userbase is fixated on 1.7 because mod makers are generally too lazy to update to 1.8.   Can I safely assume you don't have much experience with modding minecraft? Many mods in minecraft are not updated due to the Minecraft Coder Pack not being completely updated to the newest version, which many advanced mods absolutely require in order to update. It's not a matter of laziness, more so being actually unable to update.    If they forced updates, then it forces the community to move up as well and they state of the game wouldn't be so bleak.   Since Mojang/minecraft doesn't officially support mods, they can't really encourage updates. This is further boosted by the fact that they don't pay mod devs, and such devs rely on donations or their own coin to keep themselves running. So, they can't really ""force"" updates. Disallowing older versions of the game would kill modding, unless they released the source code of the game, and would enrage players.  Excellent discussion, by the way. I haven't written this much in a while. :)"
starbound,3bsc5u,Gangsir,0,Wed Jul 1 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"I understand quite well that humans are not perfect, but reverting all the way back to koala because of a bug in one of the Giraffe versions is extreme and unnecessary. There are 2 buffer layers preventing such major bugs from making it to Stable.  Fun fact, you can already access the source code of Minecraft if you decompile it. So that excuse is out the window. The coder pack is not ""required"" for any mod. Its an API, nothing more. It just makes mod making easier so modders don't have to reinvent the wheel every time. Plus MCP and Forge both have 1.8 versions, soo I await Buildcraft and IC2 updates... a years later...  With Starbound, there is no real reason to offering Koala versions."

starbound,3bp0to,Draithian,9,Tue Jun 30 23:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to go into insane detail, but I will say that like with virtually everything in game development, it is nowhere near that simple.    Right now, in order to make those player made structures spawnable in the game for everybody, the developers would have to recreate them block by block in Tiled. See here for an example of a small dungeon being made in Tiled right now.  Then the structure would have to be tested in playthroughs, testing world generation, assigned to a biome (or many), given appropriate loot or NPCs, etc.    Long story short, it would take a lot of development time, and it is absolutely not what the developers are or should be focusing on right now. Even if this were a high priority for them right this second, the correct thing for them to do (and what they are doing) is to get their version of Tiled ready for public release.  Once we all have Tiled, then we can start making our own structures and sharing them with each other (and the devs). At that point, it is a lot less work on their end to put our structures in the game.  Also, they have a ton of assets and biomes that are disabled in the game right now for various reasons. Same deal there.. if it was something they wanted to focus on right now then they would fix those up and implement/re-implement all of them."
starbound,3bp0to,Varixai,7,Wed Jul 1 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"It's actually more along the lines of that the current dungeon format does not support a lot of what player constructions can possess (like signs, or painted blocks).  Serializing player structures to data is trivial and already exists in mods (see mods that allow players to save and load structures), but many limitations in the mod API (cannot write to any file except log file, cannot read from files, cannot query if a block is painted, etc, cannot place blocks in mid air, etc.) mean structure sharing, or handbuilt structures exported to dungeon format, is too crippled and tedious to be useful.  Why Chucklefish even bothered with Tiled when, with a few tweaks plus an export function, their game engine itself could serve as a far superior map editor, is beyond me."
starbound,3bp0to,Narks,4,Wed Jul 1 09:12:47 2015 UTC,"100% agree, plus the export itself would be as simple as:   Select region for export (with either in-game tool or cursor overlay). Enumerate used objects and their parameters (filter out monsters, NPCs and players, if any). Build object list and assign colour codes to them. Export background layer as .png image. Export foreground layer as .png image. Export objects layer as .png image. Export .dungeon definition file.   Personally, I'd like to see more small functional surface structures, like this one I built myself: http://i.imgur.com/Svyy9iG.png"
starbound,3bp0to,dsp2003,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:41:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe once the developers release the tool that is used to design structures to the public (they use a custom version of Tiled) and they have enough time to dedicate manpower to picking good builds and actually implementing and testing them, maybe this will happen. But if it ever happens, it will be once the game is ready for release and the developers want a boatload of new content for that release."

I believe I said something about a sneak peak at some of the new special furniture sets. :D Here’s a look at a saloon-themed set!  Saloon set [PNG]  I’m personally excited about these themed sets — they’re going to allow for so much more variety and creativity in decorating builds! What do you guys think?

I wish I could grow supplies for Floran blocks (using bamboo or reeds, or grow the trees their orange wood comes from), for example. Or buy the blocks from the other races. Maybe at one pixel per block. idk, there's probably loads of options. But as a Floran, I'd like to actually grow my building materials. Bamboo for bamboo and wicker, reeds for thatch, whatever, you know?"
starbound,3bn8e6,Ende_schon_heute,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:32:05 2015 UTC,"Depending on how open minded you are towards modding your game, there are some tweaks and workarounds that might fix you up with the goods you want. First and foremost you'd want to check out the Reeds And Bamboo mod.  Then, by proxy of its grey goo function, you can multiply blocks with The Universal Uncrafter. Pop some spare materials in, get grey goo and turn it into whatever you need in quantity. There are some other mods letting you get large amounts of building material, but this one is nice insofar as it takes a little effort and time investment to actually stock up on something. So no ""just buying stuff"" with this.  And for your wish to leave generated towns intact yet still wanting to take their stuff, here's the  Craftable 3D Printer that you can carry around, set up on a wall, scan all the stuff, print another copy and put it back where it came from. All conveniently done without having to pile everything up in your inventory and beaming back to your ship. It's super cool for established bases or larger projects for which you'd want access to all the furniture without having to construct a large warehouse beforehand."

But I'd really rather have it in vanilla, you know?  With blocks you'd think you could craft, there's a very slight disappointment with not being able to grow your own materials.  Does that mod let you craft thatch with reeds or bamboo? It doesn't say. Also wicker. I'm not on a computer I can load Starbound up on, currently, so I can't check. But since thatch can be made from reeds, and wicker from bamboo (or also reeds), it makes sense.  Thanks for the links, by the way! It's going to take some extra work, but as long as I can leave towns intact, I think I'm going to enjoy these."

Be mindful that it has been said by tiy himself that these are just test/placeholder versions of the game and that the final will be very different.

starbound,3bmv41,Varixai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Varixai. The kind of change necessary to prevent all old characters from loading screams ""changes to player.config"" and that isn't necessarily a bug."
starbound,3bmv41,Mackinz,2,Tue Jun 30 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"There weren't any visible changes last night that would cause this, though there were 2 very small changes the night before that I guess may have. Those 2 changes don't look like an intended wipe at all.  It could be something in the executable causing this. We'll see if it is fixed in the next couple Nightly updates, or if a dev responds about it."
starbound,3bmv41,Varixai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:30:31 2015 UTC,Is there any way to play with the character since the files are all still there? Like some kind of manual override.

starbound,3bm5ba,Sydney90,4,Tue Jun 30 09:43:40 2015 UTC,"If you've played Terraria, then it's pretty the same way. You're a host and sharing your universe and things you've done to it with others, or you may join someone's universe as well, while having your spaceship with your items, also everything that your character has. Be really careful though, there are trolls who can make a mess on your spaceship or even make a trap that kills you there as you spawn. I'd recommend playing it with friends or don't join strangers' parties. That said, but, yeah, it's pretty much just like singleplayer with other people. So, the main difference are players universes, it doesn't affect your spaceship and your character, just different worlds. Multiplayer doesn't have a ""Steam multiplayer thing"" though, it's a separate program that you may use to setup your own server, but you'll need public ip address (ask your ISP for that one) or use Evolve program (it works just like Hamachi if you're familiar to things like that, but much easier to setup, free and etc). Enjoy your Starbound and I also hope that you'll find some really nice people online to have some good fun!"

As far as i understood, there are some dedicated servers i could join if i don't have other friends to play with, but some don't allow for building and harvesting. Can you tell me a couple servers where i can build and harvest stuff if they exist? Otherwise i will start my own server. With blackjack and hookers of course."
starbound,3bm5ba,thekey147,4,Tue Jun 30 11:54:56 2015 UTC,"/r/starboundservers is probably where I would go to find a server, but, honestly, if you don't have any friends to play with, I'd stick with single player at first to get your feet wet, people online can be mean.  If you want to learn how to start your own server, you can probably look up a guide pretty easily."

starbound,3bn4a3,Kusibu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to host a server for multiplayer, you do need to run the server separate from the client. If you're playing single player, you only need the client. As for the best version, I wouldn't know, but logically the 64bit opengl would work best, if you have a 64 bit computer and good graphic card."
starbound,3bn4a3,Gangsir,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"Starbound uses an internal server for single player, but does not have multiplayer capability within that. You must run the server independently for that. 64bit is always the better Usually one would suggest graphics settings to turn down or off, but Starbound doesnt really have any. It is what it is. The only thing you can really do is make sure your computer is actually up to the task (Which it doesn't sound like it is), and decrease the number of other processes that are needlessly running."

Just get any mod, put a 'music' folder in with the rest of the folders, and put your songs in, with the names of the songs you're replacing.  That's one way of doing it, but as it turns out I made a radio tech mod that lets you play music. Sadly it takes up a tech slot, so it's not the best solution. Here it is if you want to give it a go anyway. I'm also working on a mod at the moment that performs the same functions as the radio, without taking a slot up. It's functional but needs a bit of fine-tuning, so keep an eye out for when it's done if you're interested."

starbound,3bdm1t,Tieblaster,325,Sun Jun 28 05:33:44 2015 UTC,"Whilst definitely very valuable, content is very easy to add. Once we reach 1.0 and our engine is complete adding a huge amount of content will come quickly and easily.   I worked on both Terraria and Starbound and whilst Terraria is a phenomenal game I don't think it's aiming to be much more than you're currently experiencing (and there's nothing wrong with that).  The reason Starbound is taking us so long is that we're trying to build an engine that allows us to do some very exciting things in the future. Before that engine is complete we make compromises and include content for the early access players that is somewhat placeholder (current quests as an example), that content allows us to experiment with new engine features and gives existing players new toys to play with whilst they wait. But going on all the time along side that is the development of a very complex engine, being developed with goals in mind that are much larger in scope than the goals I believe Terraria is trying to achieve.  The Starbound engine is almost done and already the potential of the engine is being explored by modders and players. Things like our scripted interface system, scripted AI, scripted weapons, scripted projectiles, scripted quests, scripted objects are being used to create extremely unique and interesting content. There's a massive time deficit that goes into creating those systems and making sure they're easy to work with and modify, but once they're done they will lead to an absolute content explosion and I think people are going to really enjoy how we use those systems.   Almost nothing is hard coded in Starbound, its almost as much a platform as it is a game. Were making it incredibly easy to add content, we'll be opening that up on steam workshop and we'll be using those systems ourselves to great effect post 1.0 release.  We have been slow in finishing the engine, part of that is because there is just no other engine out there that does what the Starbound engine does and we refused to compromise. Starbound as a project is going to bring everyone involved a great deal more entertainment, its going to evolve a bunch more times before its done and when it is done the sheer amount of content is going to be astounding."

Throw in more random skills on enemies. Give bosses 2-3 ""phases"" where they get new skills and/or attributes. Give enemies a chance for a random affix, or more.

One of the reasons I was so excited about Starbound in the first place was the flexibility of the engine and to build that from scratch is no easy feat, unfortunately a lot of people don't understand that. I mean games are still being made with the source engine for the love of god, heck, Bethesda keeps using broken ass gamebyro for everything. Who knows what else Starbound will bring? Although I'm not as active with this game and its community I still believe this game will be awesome when it's finished and it can come out whenever it comes out, I'll still be waiting patiently. There plenty of things to do in the meantime anyway. The only way I would be bothered is if this game was given up on and considering how passionate and excited you guys were when this game was announced, I doubt that will ever happen. You guys got my vote. Plus with workshop support people are going to lose their shit when it comes out."
starbound,3bdm1t,flippitydip,6,Sun Jun 28 19:50:33 2015 UTC,I saw someone comparing Chucklefish to EA
starbound,3bdm1t,ozeloti,6,Mon Jun 29 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's pretty absurd"
starbound,3bdm1t,flippitydip,5,Mon Jun 29 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"I think the problem most people have is not that Starbound is getting delayed. I think you should not be angry at the peoply who are upset about the delays. No, people can put up with that. People have in the past on a lot of games and they will continue to do so in the future. No, the Problem at hand we are facing is the amount of time this project has been in early access. I think people play differently when they know that a game ""is not finished"" in ""beta"" or ""alpha"" or whatever, you name it.   You see, I stopped playing Starbound at the 180~ hour mark so I can still enjoy it when it finally comes out, because I have the problem of getting bored of anything pretty quickly if the repitition gets to me and I don't think I am alone on this one. But there are a lot of people out there who have the same problem but do not understand that they should stop playing for their own sake, due to a lack of self-reflection. Even with alle the content in the world, Starbound has a certain amount of gameplay at its core and once you master it to a certain degree you will eventually get bored. No amount of content in the entire world is going to change that and introducing new little systems is only adding another few dozen hours to the game until you are ""done"" with it.  So when players ""burn"" through starbound in about 200-500 hours they constantly think about how they are playing a not finished game. Tiyuri has said it in the past, the game is ""practically"" finished and I think nobody would have a problem with it not being in early access at its current state. (don't do that btw, that would probably be worse than it is now xD)  Waiting for a finished product is not whats driving people nuts, its that they can exactly see how its being finished, coupled with the fact that we don't even know what is missing from the game.  Also: I think some of the people who are crying the loudest about it would probably have been the most passionate players in your player base. I mean think about it, they seem to be pretty obsessed with the game when they can't wait until its done."
starbound,3bdm1t,McWhitegk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of it like that, makes sense. I'm the same, I stopped at like 200 hours so I wouldn't get tired of it when it came out. That way I can hype myself a bit. That's also kind of why I stopped coming to the sub so frequently so it would be a surprise when it came out, not for lack of support mind you. Tbh sometimes I think people that make whiny posts are mostly children."
starbound,3bdm1t,flippitydip,2,Mon Jun 29 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"I gotta say I just love how accessible starbound is for modding, just playing with that alone is enough to keep me interested in this game for the good long run. I've learned the limitations of the engine currently and I'm optimistic to see what you guys will do with it in the future, especially combat!"
starbound,3bdm1t,RobbieMcSkillet,3,Mon Jun 29 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"quickly and easily.   Thick and fast, eh?"

starbound,3bdm1t,SileAnimus,7,Sun Jun 28 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"It's like cake batter vs a baked cake. They're adding more and more icing to Terraria, and people are saying that Starbound's bowl of cake batter is bland."
starbound,3bdm1t,ZoomBoingDing,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:29:11 2015 UTC,"Not really, its just different points of development. I'm sure that at one point Terraria was being looked at the way starbound is. After reading ty's post I look at it like this, Terraria is done with engine so they are adding fun stuff, he just said starbound is still working on its engine and one day will just be adding fun stuff only."
starbound,3bdm1t,Karnej,3,Fri Jul 10 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've seen a dev respond to any post mentioning Terraria, and it's a great response. This makes a lot of sense, and squashes some fears I had."
starbound,3bdm1t,Flarkinater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:20:56 2015 UTC,So the game Will be the engine as well? Like minecraft sorta is?
starbound,3bdm1t,TheTallGentleman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"The engine is certainly very impressive.   If it were 3D, and support VR it remind one more of the Matrix than Terraria.  Though, I still see a missing link here, is it possible to script weapons and stuff in game (at run time), the same way you can build things? Similar to what Space Engineers allows? Could also make a nice crafting system. That would allow pretty much the perfect Matrix-engine (based on your ability to do pretty much anything), ... in 2D."
starbound,3bdm1t,GregTheMad,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:34:13 2015 UTC,Most people understand that it takes time to get the engine working correctly and the game running in the direction you want it to. All fans can ask for is that you continue doing what you do and continue to make the game fun. I'm sure once 1.0 comes out we'll see some really fantastic stuff coming from you guys just like with the Terraria devs.
starbound,3bdm1t,Ravness13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:01:25 2015 UTC,Iv'e been playing Starbound for a long while now and I love it. Every time there is an update the new content is AMAZING! In addition I love that we have a chance to get actual feedback from the devs here and that you are very involved with the community. Thanks for all your hard work!

starbound,3bdm1t,PermaLunacy,5,Sun Jun 28 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"When will you reach 1.0?    When it's done.   How so?   Because Terraria is a finished game as is, and its general formula of ore grinding and boss fighting isn't going to change because it doesn't need to."
starbound,3bdm1t,Mackinz,-8,Sun Jun 28 21:53:05 2015 UTC,"""when it's done"" Because that day will come. Surely."
starbound,3bdm1t,PermaLunacy,5,Sun Jun 28 22:47:07 2015 UTC,"It will. There will come a point where the game is feature complete according to Chucklefish. That time is not now, but they surely have an in-house plan to get to that point. I'd wager within a year."
starbound,3bdm1t,Mackinz,0,Sun Jun 28 23:43:36 2015 UTC,I actually love gambling. How much are you willing to wager?
starbound,3bdm1t,PermaLunacy,-1,Mon Jun 29 02:15:46 2015 UTC,"""Once we reach 1.0 and our engine is complete adding a huge amount of content will come quickly and easily.""  Gonna have to call you on that one, nearly every update has been to polish some finished product or additional free content as if the game is finished (NPC idle animations, emotes, ""special furniture sets"", random name generator lol, ""experiments"", more sand colors, Crabby Critters, LUA scripting engine thing [totes 1.0 feature right here gaiz], etc). Seriously, do you guys prioritize tasks? Consider using a project management methodology (scrum seems to be popular these days) because there's like half a dev actually working on what matters going by updates/nightly. Focus on the core first, then spend time on ""Metadept’s experiments"" after 1.0.   And just to be clear it's not like the updates are adding something important in like actual the core component for idle animations, it's someone spending x hours creating a bunch of extra animations because it's fun and easy instead of spending time working on a mission/quest/dungeons (the actual 1.0 stuff) for example.   tl;dr: Next update: ""Doom playable in game!"""
starbound,3bdm1t,reoneclipse,43,Fri Jul 10 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"It seems like Terraria has perfected its formula now. Gameplay is good, progression is good, exploration feels rewarding, your world means something to you. They pretty much nailed everything that it needs to. So they're  in a position to be able to focus on new content rather than always having to focus on refining the game.  The problem with Starbound is that it hasn't done that yet. There's a lot of problems with the game itself, so fixing that is still a big priority, more so than big content updates like with Terraria."
starbound,3bdm1t,Ravness13,13,Sun Jun 28 12:33:42 2015 UTC,"I think people tend to overlook that aspect. They forget that they are overhauling a lot of things based on fan feedback and are very open about what they are doing. It has taken some time, but they are doing some great work on advancing starbound while Terraria has already had that stage and can now perfect the formula they want for the game."
starbound,3bdm1t,NinjaVikingFromSpace,71,Sun Jun 28 12:44:02 2015 UTC,"While, right now, Starbound is indeed a lot worse than Terraria in quite a few aspects (progression is lackluster, combat pretty much sucks, exploration is lacking) it looks like Chucklefish is working hard on improving those aspects and I hope that the next two big updates will fix many of the game's problems. Especially the combat update.   In the end it will probably be a matter of opinion whether Starbound is better or worse than Terraria, but I am optimistic that it will be a great game in its own right."
starbound,3bdm1t,KungFuHamster,30,Sun Jun 28 09:52:13 2015 UTC,"What I don't like is all of the instancing. Boss fights and specials in Terraria are all in the main world, no splintering. Starbound wants to move everything special into all these instances, which I don't care for."
starbound,3bdm1t,draconisilver,29,Sun Jun 28 12:04:58 2015 UTC,"The instancing is enjoyable to me, because it means I always fight the monster on the same battlefield. A lot of Terraria can turn in to building a ""boss arena"" for the particular boss, which occasionally invalidates some of the bosses, or makes it fairly easy to beat. In Starbound, theoretically, a boss can't be out-constructed, simply out fought. I think that's neat. Not to say it's better, but just that it does bring a totally different aspect to a boss fight."
starbound,3bdm1t,theoriginaled,40,Sun Jun 28 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"Thats disingenuous.. the bossfights in terraria arent just about combat, theyre about ingenuity. Being prepared and building and using the world's resources to trivialize what was once a terror is not cheating, its playing the game the way its meant to be played which is ""however you want"". I wont turn this into a starbound vs terraria post but using the resources you are provided to make things easier for yourself is never cheating its ingenuity."
starbound,3bdm1t,zaxudih,3,Sun Jun 28 14:34:46 2015 UTC,I don't see why there can't be both types in Starbound.
starbound,3bdm1t,KungFuHamster,6,Sun Jun 28 17:34:33 2015 UTC,I agree with that. Most of the bosses in Terraria are super-hard in a random environment and a lot of players would probably never pass them without prep.
starbound,3bdm1t,theoriginaled,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:42:36 2015 UTC,Thats one of the best things about terraria in my opinion. the sense of progress. I remember the first time I ever encountered the eye of cthulu. It tore me up. But as you learn the game as you learn the systems and better ways to do things it trivializes it. Terraria does this better than any other game I can think of. Force the player to LEARN rather than just beat their head against the system until they get it.
starbound,3bdm1t,draconisilver,2,Sun Jun 28 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"You seem to have put a lot of words in my mouth! I never once called it cheating, I simply said certain arenas can invalidate certain bossfights, and most arenas are fairly simple to devise. WoF basically just requires one really long pathway, not fairly ingenious, just time consuming. Yes, it does mean you have the ability to devise your own victories through personal design (see the old No Flinch items combined with lava blocks for invincibility), but it does mean it's easier to reduce a fight's effectiveness through arena design, ignoring certain mechanics, or largely making an enemy ineffective. It's what the big difference is in bosses between the two, and why arenas simply make things different.  Not a bad thing, I agree with you on that, it does mean you can be creative to conquer difficulty, but it does mean boss fights can lack that certain oomph."
starbound,3bdm1t,MrButtermancer,13,Sun Jun 28 22:22:02 2015 UTC,"Uh, you basically can't beat the Wall of Flesh the first time without building a pathway. It's absolutely designed to be that way, too. I feel like it's an intended mechanic."
starbound,3bdm1t,draconisilver,5,Sun Jun 28 15:08:22 2015 UTC,"Well, of course, but if you were forced into an arena, that was a long pathway with additional difficulties thrown in you couldn't simply iron out with a pickaxe before hand, suddenly the fight has a bit of extra drama...  It does mean you don't have as much freedom in design, but it also means a fight will remain of a consistent difficulty."
starbound,3bdm1t,Dunder_Chingis,2,Sun Jun 28 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"Really? Me and my friends have NEVER built a straight path in Hell to fight the wall of flesh, we just make a bunch of obsidian skin/water walking potions and quaff 'em."
starbound,3bdm1t,MrButtermancer,2,Mon Jun 29 01:08:49 2015 UTC,"Shark Fins are a bit out of the way, and you've still gotta climb over the towers. I feel like that's... emergent at best. Platforms are still the standard."
starbound,3bdm1t,beenoc,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:17:42 2015 UTC,"What? I've never built a pathway for the WoF, and I've only ever failed on the first try once (out of ~20 worlds)."

starbound,3bdm1t,Mattpoppybros,2,Sun Jun 28 18:02:29 2015 UTC,You were probably greatly over preparing for the fight then.
starbound,3bdm1t,beenoc,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Full molten armor, Night's Edge, 400 HP, Flamarang, and the Ivy Whip. Is that overpreparing? if it is, I guess I do."
starbound,3bdm1t,Fooled_You,2,Sun Jun 28 18:47:28 2015 UTC,"That can be seen as over preparing, but that would make you rather well off for Hardmode. Plus, if you were good with the ivy whip that would invalidate the reason to have a platform. So, two ways to do it :)"
starbound,3bdm1t,Mattpoppybros,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that definitely is. Potions too, or no potions? With a platform you can just spam molotovs or water bolt and do fine."
starbound,3bdm1t,beenoc,2,Sun Jun 28 19:03:16 2015 UTC,Potions. I've never used Molotovs.
starbound,3bdm1t,ozeloti,3,Sun Jun 28 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"Weird. I've never built an arena for the bosses in Terraria and everyone seems to do it. The only thing close to an arena i made was a bridge to fight the WOF, and it was pretty short too."
starbound,3bdm1t,pickten,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:20:05 2015 UTC,"I once tried for eye of cthullu, but that's it (it was also really bad, and I wound up not using it in the end)"
starbound,3bdm1t,draconisilver,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"I usually just keep it au natural myself, but it's certainly an option. It's interesting you can make an arena to lessen a boss's difficulty, but it does also mean the boss is inconsistent in it's difficulty. A forced arena does mean things don't change, but it also means it never gets easier/harder depending on environs.  There's pros and cons to this setup, but I actually immensely enjoy the fact that both exist, was my intention. I think both systems work rather well!"
starbound,3bdm1t,franktacular,3,Sun Jun 28 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"I like instancing because it gives you a reason to build consumables. It gets you away from the skyrim mentality of ""ooh, I should save this potion for later because I might need it."" Personally I like needing to build up flares and molotovs to use in instances because you can't just build dirt blocks around enemies then dig a small hole to shoot them through"
starbound,3bdm1t,SupaSlide,12,Sun Jun 28 20:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite, I don't like how Terraria does bosses. It's the reason I quit playing.  I want to be able to explore the planets and my world without having to worry about some boss randomly coming up to me and trying to eat my face off when all I wanted to do was build a porch for my house."
starbound,3bdm1t,SasparillaTango,23,Sun Jun 28 12:55:43 2015 UTC,Bosses only random appear once to try to force progression.

I hadn't spent time getting ready for the next boss fight because I was having fun building and the boss decided that wasn't good enough :P"

starbound,3bdm1t,anonymau5,31,Sun Jun 28 13:51:41 2015 UTC,Calm down. It only needs about 2 more years development  source: i buy a lot of early access games
starbound,3bdm1t,Mackinz,-6,Sun Jun 28 11:49:47 2015 UTC,"No, probably closer to one year or less."
starbound,3bdm1t,PermaLunacy,102,Sun Jun 28 16:49:36 2015 UTC,Early Access is not an excuse at this point.
starbound,3bdm1t,Whilyam,25,Sun Jun 28 09:35:48 2015 UTC,"Starbound and Terraria operate on two different styles of development in my opinion. While Terraria takes a more traditional style of making large, mostly self-contained, updates, Starbound works on a Minecraft style of updating where systems are added in just to get some functionality and get polished up (i.e. totally reworked) later. It's pretty clear that it hasn't worked very well for Starbound, but it's not going to doom the game or anything."
starbound,3bdm1t,yendorion,6,Sun Jun 28 13:35:34 2015 UTC,Except Minecraft has been long out of early access itself.
starbound,3bdm1t,Whilyam,46,Sun Jun 28 14:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, and Minecraft still has a bunch of shitty mechanics that they're still reworking. Combat is supposedly covered in the next patch."
starbound,3bdm1t,yendorion,13,Sun Jun 28 14:08:58 2015 UTC,Yes Minecraft is still vastly under development as a game with features but it has more than enough going for it as an education tool in schools. It's this two-fold purposes Minecraft which sets it apart from other games for most part.
starbound,3bdm1t,Whilyam,12,Sun Jun 28 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"This is true, although I personally see the educational aspect of it more of a distraction and/or teachers latching onto something popular in a desperate attempt to get their students to pay attention. Like using Frozen to teach the phases of matter.  That aside, I'm talking about the games as games, not as other uses. As another example, Kerbal Space Program follows a similar style for updates which has led to a lot of issues with the new aerodynamics system getting patched over and over because the devs didn't think it through, not to mention that contracts had to be added and changed because they were boring as fuck (and still are for some)."
starbound,3bdm1t,Roxxorsmash,5,Sun Jun 28 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"But Minecraft took forever before it came out as a full ""1.0"" release..."
starbound,3bdm1t,Mackinz,50,Sun Jun 28 15:40:52 2015 UTC,It would have been more of an excuse if it hadn't been out since 2013 and made little progress.
starbound,3bdm1t,Movhan,25,Sun Jun 28 09:41:33 2015 UTC,"They haven't made little progress. They have actually made a lot of progress since the first client was downloaded. Tons of features have been worked on, core features of the game system, and there is still more progress being made as can be seen in the Nightly and via the dev blog. Even when they have been in a ""lull"", they have been working their butts off improving the engine of Starbound (that lull of updates from last summer was because kyren had to re-write and upgrade the game engine). Sure, the game won't be done for a while, but do not assume that little progress has been made when the colony system being worked on in Nightly right now would not have been possible in Enraged Koala."
starbound,3bdm1t,Death_To_Dem_Homos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"If anything, the game has actually digressed. With the move to Terraria-style progression where you are gated from planetss until you get a particular techskin, and tying all that to the ore, tech ups and crafting table upgrades, Starbound actually lost its feel of a ""great big adventure in space"" because it made the universe feel even more compartmentalized.   The atmosphere is shot because you're in the space age and still using mining axes, and without the survival mechanics exploration became even more drab.   The game feels more and more like its just tile and number changes each techup, the way it played from Day 1 where you were still mining with your copper pickaxe feels exactly like how it plays with a diamond drill and rubidized armor later on.  The big casualty of this was combat. It actually became worse. Before at least combat kinda felt interesting one you get out pace your enemies going to o irate airships to get guns, and bosses occurred in the main world. Now with gated items and instanced bosses, the boss fights are boring and uninteresting."

I'm not sure what you thought you paid for, but Starbound Early Access wasn't billed as a complete game. It was released as ""Hey guys, this is not done but technically playable, and we're to release it so you could give us some feedback on the game and influence its direction.""  Chucklefish is still developing the game, and still responding to community feedback, so I'm not really sure what your grounds are for claiming ""Early Access is not an excuse at this point""."
starbound,3bdm1t,LunaticSongXIV,-2,Sun Jun 28 16:31:43 2015 UTC,The problem isn't that it's in this state. The problem is that it hasn't really changed significantly in almost 2 years.
starbound,3bdm1t,nerfviking,13,Sun Jun 28 16:57:00 2015 UTC,I would strongly disagree with that.  Starbound has significantly changed from two years ago.
starbound,3bdm1t,DerikP,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"It's not really about what's an ""excuse"" and what isn't.  Development takes time.  It's abundantly clear that CF drastically underestimated how much time it was going to take to get the game finished.  And for people who want a finished game now now now, that's unfortunate, but complaining about it isn't going to make the game go any faster.  Unlike a number of other early access projects, CF hasn't abandoned their game half way through.  They're continuing to develop it, and that development (as well as the cost of relocating their dev team to a different country) is expensive.  I think it's safe to say that they owe us the game that was promised when we bought it, but it's an incredibly ambitious project, and it's going to take a while."
starbound,3bdm1t,stealthcl0wn,34,Mon Jun 29 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"Starbound is in Beta. It is an incomplete product and is not representative of the final released game. Terraria, on the other hand, is a complete game, with new updates adding content. Starbound's developers still need to lay out the groundwork of the game; the backend stuff that lets them pump out lots of new items and content. And they're 100% supporting modders, so they have to keep that in mind while they make their game.    This is how I understand it. I don't think it's fair to compare Starbound to Terraria."
starbound,3bdm1t,DerikP,58,Sun Jun 28 08:10:46 2015 UTC,"Terraria in beta still felt more complete than Starbound in beta, though."
starbound,3bdm1t,Daimoth,26,Sun Jun 28 10:16:27 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider is the fact that Starbound is a much larger game than Terraria. Terraria takes place in relatively small, finite worlds with real boundaries. It has unique weapons. Starbound takes place in countless randomly generated planets, with randomly generated monsters and randomly generated gear. It has a primitive quest system, but it's being worked on. From what I see, Starbound has more to it now than Terraria did in Beta."
starbound,3bdm1t,Ravness13,32,Sun Jun 28 10:29:00 2015 UTC,"... Which illustrates the importance of scope, imo."
starbound,3bdm1t,Daimoth,4,Sun Jun 28 10:34:10 2015 UTC,"To an extent honestly. They are trying for a very open and broad version of a game like Terraria. It's certainly bigger and has a lot of plans that Terraria simply didn't have at the start. Sure they may have had some miss steps but the scope of it is fine. They really just needed to start getting things together.  Besides they have laid out plans and have made some much needed adjustments on the nightly to make it better. Terraria definitely has their view down and do absolutely wonderful work on it, but I wouldn't count chucklefish out just yet. Let them actually figure out how they want things and give them a chance. Heck it took years for Terraria to come into its own."
starbound,3bdm1t,Ravness13,7,Sun Jun 28 12:42:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Red started working on the game again because he noticed Terraria's user base had been quietly (but dramatically) growing. Further evidence is that Starbound's development began when Terraria was still quite young.  What I meant by scope was that they appear to have bitten off more than they can chew. Everything happens veeeeery slooooowly with Starbound in terms of development, and I'd bet my bottom dollar it's because the scope of the game is too broad for even a very good dev team to handle well.  IMO, of course."
starbound,3bdm1t,stealthcl0wn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:33:26 2015 UTC,"This is true. It certainly did seem that way at the start and when they released it to the public. However I feel personally since then they have come a long way towards fixing up things and pointing the game in its entirety towards the direction it should be going. Sure it has taken a while, but I think they managed to get the understanding of what they were getting themselves into down."
starbound,3bdm1t,rw-blackbird,14,Sun Jun 28 14:08:48 2015 UTC,"Heck it took years for Terraria to come into its own.   It came into it's own around 1.1, which was released in Dec 8th 2011, which was only a few months after 1.0"
starbound,3bdm1t,Daimoth,4,Sun Jun 28 12:56:59 2015 UTC,"Even if that's the case, Terraria wasn't in beta at 1.0, if you're trying to compare it to Starbound on that basis.  Was Terraria even publicly available when it was in development?"
starbound,3bdm1t,rw-blackbird,9,Sun Jun 28 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"And why is that? Why was Terraria able to hit 1.0 so, so much sooner despite the fact that Terraria is not particularly short and certainly not unsatisfying to play? In my opinion, the difference is mostly scope. Of course the greater level of detail could also be argued, but generally art assets are finished long before everything else, which is why aesthetic DLC is so commonplace in the industry."
starbound,3bdm1t,CrashmanX,4,Sun Jun 28 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The planned scope of Starbound is far beyond the scope of Terraria.  One has to take that into account when attempting to compare features and development times.  People watching Star Citizen need to remember this, too.  It's not as if new modules can be dropped in every couple months.  The backend needs to be complete, too, and software development is not like construction.  Bugs can emerge and eliminating them can take much longer than expected.  This is why so many companies shy away from announcing release dates (and only do so at the demands of their publishers).  It's also often why games are sometimes released unfinished or lacking polish.  It's usually the publisher forcing the developer to release against the developers' wishes (or the developer simply running out of money)."
starbound,3bdm1t,Ravness13,2,Sun Jun 28 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"Why was Terraria able to hit 1.0 so, so much sooner despite the fact that Terraria is not particularly short and certainly not unsatisfying to play?   Because Terraria had a lot less ""complex"" systems out of the gate. Starbound is trying to be all crazy and have full combat progression, full ""Rental"" progression, Farmer progression, and a million other ways to read end-game by the time 1.0 is out.   Meanwhile Terraria is focused on Combat and just combat. It has a minor focus on NPCs and a secondary focus on building.   Scope is easily the issue with Starbound. Starbound doesn't know what it wants to be it wants to be everything but it's spreading itself too thin."
starbound,3bdm1t,Milguas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yea at the beginning it was fairly bare bones honestly. When it first released it didn't have much, and while 1.0 added quite a bit it wasn't until after that they really hit their stride. Sometimes it just takes some love and care by the devs of a game for it to get really good after a rocky or just slow start.  I feel Terraria probably got that a little quicker since it was a more focused game, but the starbound devs are doing a fantastic job at fixing things up and once they get it down pat I'm sure they will make some really good content as well."
starbound,3bdm1t,stealthcl0wn,-1,Sun Jun 28 14:11:53 2015 UTC,ignoring the gap of over a year where the game was abandoned like LITERALLY abandoned.
starbound,3bdm1t,bbandolier,8,Sun Jun 28 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"The game was finished when it was abandoned, though.   It was launched in May and hit 1.0 in December.  Starbound beta launched on Dec 4th 2013. It's still in beta."
starbound,3bdm1t,theoriginaled,7,Sun Jun 28 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"It was literally complete, and they literally said ""hey, we enjoyed making this, but we're done updating it"" and we were all ""ooh boo, that sucks"" but it didn't make them wrong.  If they had never touched Terraria again it would have been a great game.  They've just come back and made it one of the greatest ever by expanding the content so much."
starbound,3bdm1t,DerikP,7,Sun Jun 28 14:29:56 2015 UTC,"No, Im sorry, but this is just flat out wrong. Starbound has the illusion of bigness given by an infinite number of procedurally generated worlds. Most of which lets be honest with ourselves are just plain empty at this point. You want a billion worlds in terraria exit to the main menu and make a billion new ones. Sure all the biomes are contained in each world but at least you know the world will have something interesting in it."
starbound,3bdm1t,theoriginaled,0,Sun Jun 28 14:49:36 2015 UTC,"Starbound does seem to be lacking in a lot of areas, but like I said, they're focusing on building up the backend stuff. And there's a lot of it."
starbound,3bdm1t,DerikP,3,Sun Jun 28 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"dont get me wrong, Im looking forward to it and Ive been playing starbound since the beginning. I just dislike the deemphasis on doing things the way you want, and the emphasis placed on artificial gating in the form of questing, environmental hazards and ""combat only"" dungeons. I personally dont think the combat is good enough to support it. but thats just me."
starbound,3bdm1t,omgitskae,0,Sun Jun 28 21:03:34 2015 UTC,"The questline currently in the game is not the final questline. It's being changed and tweaked as they develop more so they can do more kinds of quests. They're planning to include questlines for all different manners of playing. If you like to farm, there's a questline. If you like to adventure, questline. You're basing all this off of an unfinished game. And if you kept up with the updates, they're adding tons of new movement-based dungeons for you to find and explore. Additionally, there's an update planned and being worked on that aims to improve combat over the system currently in place."
starbound,3bdm1t,ozeloti,14,Sun Jun 28 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"The lowest Starbound has ever been has been $10.99. Why? Because it's early access. You can regularly buy Terraria on sale for $1.99, and they are still pumping out huge free content updates while also working on Terraria 2, Pixel Piracy (apparently they just make crossover content for this), and a Terraria spinoff. I bought Starbound a long time ago with huge expectations (I know, big mistake buying EA and expecting anything at all), but they aren't living up to any of it at all, whatsoever.  It might not be fair to compare them as games, but it IS fair to compare the decisions made by both developers. Chucklefish jumped on this early access train for some quick cash and support, but fails to meet expectations, most of their sales still get full price of the game. Meanwhile Re-Logic is working on several games at once, while making very large updates to Terraria, a game that has been bundled numerous times and goes on sale for almost nothing extremely frequently. They're probably not making much money off of Terraria right now but you can see the passion they have for the game. The impression I get from Chucklefish is the same I get from every other EA game I've bought. They just want to grab my money.  Edit: Some typos."
starbound,3bdm1t,DerikP,8,Sun Jun 28 14:10:01 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it that way. I don't they they just want to ""grab your money"". I think they do care about us, as they have even added community made content to the game. Also Starbound, or at least, what they want Starbound to turn into is much bigger than Terraria. In Terraria you have one world with desert, forest, the dungeon, the jungle, snow, the beach, the hallow, either corruption or crimson and the underworld. But in Starbound there are more biomes and far more structures. Also some devs work faster and others slower. And Chucklefish has made good games like Risk of Rain. Also the fans asked for early access. I don't really think it's fair to compare Chucklefish with EA."
starbound,3bdm1t,Mackinz,4,Sun Jun 28 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"They jumped on the ""Early Access Train"" because they wanted to devote more time to the game. They still have to support themselves and their families, so it's fair that they did that, what with all the demand for the game to be released at the time. And comparing the sales of the game is unfair. Early Access games do not, in what I've seen, go on sale below 33% off."
starbound,3bdm1t,Sorlex,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"They just want to grab my money.   And yet they still are working on the game far more than any triple A game developer would be, demonstrating their daily work on their blog, updating the Nightly build of Starbound almost daily with new WIP content, and other things which demonstrate that they aren't in it solely for the money."
starbound,3bdm1t,Grai_M,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:56:04 2015 UTC,Starbound's developers still need to lay out the groundwork of the game   Like bowling balls and more musical instruments?
starbound,3bdm1t,0000013,8,Mon Jun 29 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"I feel the main reason Starbound is taking longer is that, while Terraria is looking very flashy and new, its still built on a very old, simple engine. Starbound on the other hand is laying the ground work for a MUCH bigger game than Terraria ever could be unless they develop Terraria 2, which would be a much more fair comparison for Starbound. Early Access is a really, really, vague word. I call bullshit on most Early Access games, but a lot of the time EA games are very functionable and full. Starbound in its current state could be called ""complete"". Its all about the naming. They are saying it isn't because they haven't made all the things they wanted possible yet. But, from a consumer standpoint, its very complete. I dont mind if Starbound takes too long, because I understand this is no big budget company and I know this isn't some simple game. Terraria's beta was simple, very simple if you think about it, compared to the mechanics already in place in Starbound. I cant wait to see what the 1.0 of this game will be, my guess is this could very well overtake Terraria in success."
starbound,3bdm1t,EmperorNer0,10,Sun Jun 28 13:32:23 2015 UTC,"a)terraria 2 is under development (not the terraria: dark world or whatever, but real terraria 2,  and B) unfortunately by the looks of it T2 and T1.5 are both gonna be released before SB 1.0 at 2020-something."
starbound,3bdm1t,MrButtermancer,2,Sun Jun 28 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"When someone says that Starbound is bigger that always, for me in this context, reads water down. It is because Starbound has tried to what Terraria does but it feels much shallower. Terraria has weight and importance. Toss in quests and you get Starbound. It has all the costume but none of the substance when substance is what matters the most."
starbound,3bdm1t,golgol12,8,Sun Jun 28 16:28:47 2015 UTC,Early Access for years. It's no longer an excuse. It's awkward and shameful.
starbound,3bdm1t,giltirn,8,Sun Jun 28 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"Playing both, Starbound is quite polished, and I would say more than Terraria. But polish doesn't equal exciting.  Starbound is just flat and mostly repetitive.  Terraria is just more exciting to play.  Even when Terraria was earlier in development it was funner to play.  In Terraria, you can only travel so far before finding a new and totally unique biome.  And some biomes are so hard that you can't explore them off the bat.  Or can only explore the surface of it.  That builds anticipation.  In Starbound, whats over the hill is more of the same terrain.   In Terraria, chests in new biomes will contain new uniquely interesting weapons and equipment you haven't yet seen.  In Starbound, they are the same weapons you have just with more damage.   Monsters in Terraria very thematically fit the biome, and have vastly different AIs and abilties.   Pretty much all the monsters in Starbound are the same."
starbound,3bdm1t,lordxi,6,Sun Jun 28 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"I think the only real conclusion from this discussion is that most people have absolutely no idea about what EA means. For the love of God, if you only have a small amount of disposable capital, don't spend it on EA games. They are, by definition, only mere sketches of what they will eventually become. They are pitches to investors, like myself, who have some free money to spend on a game that may turn out to be great in a few years. If you don't have the patience, stay out of EA!!!"
starbound,3bdm1t,hatestheinternet,6,Mon Jun 29 02:37:46 2015 UTC,"No. I started with Terraria 1.1 and when 1.2 came I was blown away. For the amount of content we got from just base Starbound, before the big update we got in January was amazing, and it has only gotten better. Chucklefish has been open the whole way about what they are doing and what we can expect."
starbound,3bdm1t,Edentastic,3,Sun Jun 28 08:43:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and people don't remember it took them 2 years to get to 1.2. So comparing it to Starbound is ridiculous. Terraria's development was also ridiculously slow and it wasn't even that great of a game until 1.2."
starbound,3bdm1t,Varanae,4,Sun Jun 28 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree. I started playing Terraria on version 1.0.1, and to this day it's the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. Also Terraria's development was actually pretty regular up until 1.1.2, which was when the developer announced that he wouldn't be doing any more updates."
starbound,3bdm1t,notyetawizard,3,Mon Jun 29 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"The difference is Terraria was never in Early Access. It was a full working game for those two years, with plenty of content. Plus there were many updates before 1.2. Overall the game was fantastic right from release."
starbound,3bdm1t,notyetawizard,3,Mon Jun 29 07:51:06 2015 UTC,"Starbound runs on linux, and Terraria does not—that's pretty much the only reason why I bought Starbound while it was still in early access. No regrets though!  (I do hear Terraria is coming to the 3DS, and I might pick that up.)"

starbound,3bdm1t,Muronelkaz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"I wonder how a ""Hey, looking at the Starbound changelog"" would fare over at /r/terraria ...  Out of curiosity, just how many procedurally generated 2D sandbox games are out there? Out of these, why is Terraria the one people constantly bring up? Answer: People get bored of Terraria and went on to the next best thing, and because it's not the same thing as the thing they got bored of, they complain. Go to any of the alternatives that people cried out as an improvement when it was fashionable at the time, games that barely have received any mention since then, and you'll find the amount of involvement to be almost nil in comparison - but at least they won't have to deal with the backslash the way Starbound does.  I'd wish people would stop comparing Starbound to Terraria and let it develop its own identity without having unique gameplay characteristics become casualties, without having it become a space-theme cloned that they think will allow them to relive their memories. Seriously, there's Terraria: Otherworld coming out if you want another Terraria clone.  Chucklefish has been making a torrent of updates to the game. But distance the updates to follow a timescale similar to Terraria's, and people complain about how they aren't making any updates and it's all a scam. Make the updates more frequent but individually less feature rich, and people complain about how the updates aren't as polished."
starbound,3bdm1t,Roflha,11,Sun Jun 28 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"Well the main reason is obviously because Tiyuri was part of the Terraria team and he went on to develop Starbound while Terraria still planned to add lots of stuff. This and other reasons caused Terraria's developer to stop making content for a while and a lot of Terraria players switched over to play Starbound. So it doesn't matter which of the two you prefer to play now, Starbound and Terraria share a history which causes them to be compared to each other and that won't really change."
starbound,3bdm1t,wolfinj,-3,Sun Jun 28 15:32:15 2015 UTC,In Terraria it feels smaller and a lot less detailed... I'm a midget in terraria and in Starbound I can see my legs move rather than shuffle around

My point being that, while Starbound started quite downright from Terraria, the recent updates have made it more similar to Terraria (the hard aspect of progress) while removing a lot of what made Starbound different.   Personally I'm my opinion, Starbound should remove most of the ground of mining... You're a freaking space explore for crying out loud, why are using a pickaxe?) And focus more on exploration and unique encounters on different worlds.   Sticking to the dumb pickaxe is e main reason why it's really nothing more than a Terraria clone right now, and a bad one at that."

starbound,3bdm1t,wolfinj,2,Wed Jul 1 13:15:34 2015 UTC,"Starbound for me is the improved version of Terraria. Terraria feels and looks to me like a game made for young children; the way the pickaxe is swung for example. There seems to be little animation and it seems very dull.  Starbound, while likely a lot less deep than Terraria currently is, feels truly open. I can fix my ship, and go and fly everywhere. Now certainly, it can currently feel meaningless to do so; it's barely worth moving from your own planet, or at least that's how it feels when it's basically the same stuff on each planet.  Starbound feels like a game with a story and complexity; it needs sharpening up and polishing, but even so, I fell in love and enjoyed Starbound instantly; within playing 5 minutes of Terraria I'd uninstalled it, and have done so several times. I can't gel with it.  I get people love Terraria, and that's great; maybe it's just personal taste. But right now, from my experience, Starbound is becoming Terraria 2.0 (albeit slowly), with better graphics, things to do and so on.  Furthermore, I love the Starbound mods that are being released; there's some great creative content being brought out, and like the signs mod, the developers are integrating some of the best ones directly into the game.

I've watched a couple gameplay vids and it seems like it has a really cool atmospheric vibe to it with great music, and just seems to be more my speed. I was stuck on the fence just because everyone kept talking about Terraria 1.3 update, so I thought I should at least wait and see what it's all about, but it seems a little chaotic for me and not quite what I was looking for."

Side effect is fan backlash from pushed deadlines and false promises.  Some people like that Chuckelfish is so apologetic but for me it's a negative.  Always saying sorry and not delivering is damage control for their marketing.

starbound,3bdm1t,Professor_Retro,0,Sun Jun 28 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I remember Redigit talking about his plans for Terraria back in 2011 before it was released and it is just now getting the Steam Cloud Save stuff.  That's over 4 years after the game was released.  Granted Terraria was leaked and Redigit was forced to release the game early.  The 1.0 release of Terraria was still quite enjoyable (I feel like the Early Access release of Starbound actually had more content than the 1.0 release, but the actual gameplay wasn't quite as polished and satisfying) but Redigit did sort of abandon the game less than a year after it was released (I know he did lots of fun updates in the time before he abandoned it... and he did eventually resume development).  I play and enjoy both games, but I'm not surprised that this rivalry exists."
starbound,3bdm1t,LARGames,-5,Mon Jun 29 05:52:58 2015 UTC,Starbound is a complete bore in my opinion. Terraria is one of the best games ever made.
starbound,3bdm1t,Mackinz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"It is one of the best games of all time, yet that doesn't mean the lore and style of Starbound is anything that doesn't make it a good game either."
starbound,3bdm1t,LARGames,6,Mon Jun 29 10:18:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Starbound is boring. From the monsters, to the planets. To the pace of change and progress and things added. Its a snooze, and I have had Starbound since it came out. It runs like crap on my computer, Terraria is a slick, beautiful graphics, deep world of action and adventure. I really really really want Starbound to be great, but everytime I log in and have to swing that crappy sword for hours and fight stupid monsters that ram me and jump in the air I get bored, I dig around in empty underground caverns slowly with that crappy laser digger, get bored after stealing some chairs or a few boxes from boring underground maps. Realize that my character carries everything he finds without issue so whats the point on building a base or storage for my rocks and seeds. Realize that the only way to heal for the first while is those crappy vines that take an hour to chop down for .1 healing bandages. Its tedious.  Terrarias sprite graphics are beautiful, boss battles are fun, the amount items amazing, the quick and lag free exploration , building and world lore creation is fun.  Its been 2 years and I still do not see any real change to Starbound that makes me think that it'll pull out before the next big thing hits that does it better."
starbound,3bdm1t,Milguas,-18,Mon Jun 29 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"Not even a little. You may not remember it, but those first couple of years in Terraria were pretty rough (back when it was first released it was in a very sorry state). Starbound hasn't been available nearly as long but it already does lots of things better. Building with the Manipulator / wiring tool / paint tool is LIGHTYEARS beyond Terraria's clunky building, especially the paint system with a dozen cans of paint, a brush, a roller and a scraper. The range at which you can build alone makes it extremely difficult to go back to Terraria.   Combat is also dramatically more varied and improved in Starbound, as is the biome generation (Terraria still suffers from having all of these different biomes rammed into a tiny map with each other). From the taste we've gotten from the nightlies, colonization will also be much more interesting than moving in NPCs.  Add to that Redigit's well-established reputation for taking long, unexpected breaks from development (which is kind of how Starbound became so popular in the first place, it was because Terraria had effectively stopped development) and there's just no comparison if you ask me.  Give Starbound time and the changelog for it will be just as impressive, I'm sure (and built on a better game to boot)."
starbound,3bdm1t,Mackinz,20,Sun Jun 28 05:45:06 2015 UTC,"The building mechanics are certainly better in Starbound, but the combat (and movement) isn't even close. The movement in Starbound used to be better than Terraria until they made moving backwards slower and Terraria added the ability to walk up 1 high blocks.  Essentially, Starbound took a step back in movement while Terraria took a step forward.  To improve combat:    Weapons need to have actual swing animations instead of the insta-swing weapons we currently have Creatures need to actually leave corpses or chunks instead of poofing like they do now There needs to be blood on impact so you can see your attacks have an effect on the enemies Guns need to use ammo instead of energy so energy can be used for staffs or special techs Staffs shouldn't restrict your movement in any way.  Backwards walking speed needs to be normal again. THIS IS A PLATFORMER. Freedom of movement is necessary. That mechanic is fine for an FPS, but limiting your movement in a game where you need to jump around just makes it more frustrating than fun.   I feel like Starbound is suffering from wanting to be different from Terraria to the point of doing things differently just for the sake of being different. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be unique, but I think that things should only be done differently if there's actually a better way of doing it."
starbound,3bdm1t,emprameen,-5,Sun Jun 28 07:12:01 2015 UTC,"Backwards walking speed needs to be normal again. THIS IS A PLATFORMER. Freedom of movement is necessary. That mechanic is fine for an FPS, but limiting your movement in a game where you need to jump around just makes it more frustrating than fun.   Disagree. I find that not rapidly accelerating when I walk backwards feels pretty natural and has allowed me to make several jumps with accuracy that would not be possible otherwise. You may be frustrated with the fact that characters can't run backwards (have you ever tried to run backwards IRL?) but I'm more frustrated with the overall floaty movement in Starbound which I find very non-conductive to platforming. I fixed that with a mod (Retr0's Less Floaty Movement) and all was good.  Plus, Starbound is part-shooter so it does have to balance guns."
starbound,3bdm1t,Greenleaf208,14,Sun Jun 28 07:27:57 2015 UTC,"have you ever tried to run backwards IRL?   That'd only be an issue if Starbound was even remotely realistic. It's a pixelized platform game, not a realistic first person one. Mechanics should be added if they increase the amount of fun they add, not how realistic they are.  For movement to improve they just need to tweak the deceleration values, not limit movement. Here's where Terraria once again has it down. Limiting movement is not a good way to balance guns. Terraria has incredibly fun gunplay yet it does the opposite. The more powerful you get, the less your movement is restricited."
starbound,3bdm1t,hatestheinternet,0,Sun Jun 28 07:50:58 2015 UTC,Which in turn translates into utter imbalanced chaos and spraying and praying. hell even in the latest trailer you see a lot of spray and prey all over the screen to the point that I started thinking I was watching a trailer for TOUHOU not Terraria.
starbound,3bdm1t,0zai0zado,0,Sun Jun 28 08:43:22 2015 UTC,"That'd only be an issue if Starbound was even remotely realistic.   But, the thing is, Starbound has to try to be more realistic than Terraria because of the different genre of game. Terraria is fantasy, which means pretty much anything goes. Magic, dragons, zombies, you name it. Starbound, as a sci-fi game, has to be slightly more realistic, which means not only is not being able to run backwards logical, it also fits the game. Being a ""pixelized platform game"" does not dictate that you must be able to run backwards as fast as you do forwards when you are holding out a weapon, consumable, or blocks (your character just turns around when not equipped with any of those, FYI).  The problem with Starbound's movement system is not rooted in not being able to run backwards (while carrying a weapon, consumable or block). It's because you slide all over the place while running and fall very slow. These are things that probably should be addressed, but the backwards walk is not nearly as significant.   The more powerful you get, the less your movement is restricited.   Same thing in Starbound. Complete quests and you'll unlock powerful tech which, among other things, allow double-jumps, bursts of speed in either horizontal direction and teleportation. It's not all about walking."
starbound,3bdm1t,dgmdavid,30,Sun Jun 28 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"The dull quests and the jarring lack of progression in this massive universe are huge problems.   Another thing is I cannot understand how you claim Starbounds combat is more refined than Terraria's. Shitty responsiveness with the melee and ranged weapons feeling horrible to aim with. I am not the only one who believes this, not by a long shot.  Starbound has its advantages over Terraria certainly, but after all this time I feel Starbound has made such little progress."
starbound,3bdm1t,farg_red,4,Sun Jun 28 05:50:57 2015 UTC,Agreed.

Because, I gotta tell you, regardless of advances in technology, a spear to the chest will always be extremely efficient. It's just that it has other drawbacks that modern (and scifi) rifles don't have.  Same thing with pickaxes (and ignore the fact that they're made out of soft metal like copper or silver or gold -- this is not real world logic, this is video game logic).   Look, you're asking the wrong questions. We have no idea, even remotely, how the matter manipulators in Starbound are supposed to work. Not even on a vague hand-wavey Doctor Who level of detail. So how can we answer the question of why it's less efficient (at lower levels) than a pickaxe?  Though if it's anything like real-world electronics, it's extremely finicky and delicate, and the batteries run out constantly, and there's constant bugs in the software, so you need patches from the central company servers, except you're several star systems away and in a busted ship, so you're lucky that it's working /at all/."

Maybe it's more likely to kill you almost instantly when it's fresh from the armory / showroom floor. But after a while? The battery on that rifle keeps getting weaker and weaker with each charge, and the coils and fuses and crap start corroding, and the helpful display lights near the trigger guard are very adamant that your warranty is CERTAINLY voided, since it explicitly states in the owners manual that it was not designed to be dunked in gross pools of Alien Juice.  And what about DRM? The Miniknog or the USCM or whoever have long ago nerfed the fatality rating on those plasma rifles for civilian use (it checks your DNA & brainwave profile against its internal database), so you're screwed unless you jailbreak it. Except that all the jailbreak instructions on the forums seem to be for several versions ago (and pre-beta, at that)... And so on. That spear starts looking pretty good!"

starbound,3be612,cvbn2000,26,Mon Jun 29 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"In my head-lore, the MM was designed to move (ie: manipulate) matter and objects for the purposes of building, interior design, etc.  It does this by projecting a kinetic plasma field a short distance, which flows along an object's surface and envelops it. On activating the trigger, the MM automatically detects the object's resonant frequency and tunes the kinetic field's frequency to match. Then, the MM estimates the object's mass via an advanced form of mass-spectrometry, and adjusts it's own power output to compensate. Internal gyroscopes and motion sensors keep the object from drifting, ensuring that the object stays where the user holds it.  The MM used by the character is an early model, released before the OSCA (Object Stability and Control Anchor) function was fully tested. This led to it being shipping with a faulty Object Acquisition module. As such, as soon as a fully-powered kinetic field envelops an object, it becomes unstable and begins to vibrate rapidly. This triggers the MM's fail-safe switch which by default initiates Object Storage mode, digitising the object and storing it safely in its internal memory. This hardware bug doesn't affect the Object Retrieval module, therefore objects retrieved from memory are fully stable and may be placed as required with no danger.  Since it was not intended to be used for digging, mining, etc, the MM can't tell the different between an object and matter (eg: a small stone block and a solid stone floor). When digging/mining, the MM is actually trying the envelop the ""object"" in a kinetic field and scan its mass. Since there is no object there, the kinetic field cannot resolve properly, and is therefore fluctuating throughout the matter while delivering resonant power to whatever it passes through. This ends up taking significantly longer than it otherwise would.  However, a beneficial by-product of this poor design is that, although all objects and matter are automatically sent to internal storage, instances of ""mixed matter"" (eg: coal in soil, or diamond in stone) are efficiently separated, simply because the fluctuating kinetic field is forced to work on such a small scale and rapid pace, essentially increasing its operational resolution.  [All the above is my own head-lore, and does not reflect the official lore 'enacted' by Chucklefish, nor does it imply any agreement or endorsement by such. Your mileage may vary. Do not pass 'go'.]"

Think of the matter manipulator as a super high tech 3D printer with the ability to disassemble and assemble matter, as well as moving and manipulating objects from a distance. Your initial cheap model does so slowly, because it struggles against the solid composition of hard materials. It is a precision tool being used to scratch away at rocks.  The pickaxe, crude as it may be, smashes things really well. I still don't understand how Gold pickaxes are superior to copper and silver in any way (iron and steel should be the natural upgrades, tough I can live with that because of the gameplay balance), but the relation of power between your starter MM, pickaxes and drills make sense to me.

The answer is that CF started the game with a set of hard tools that could be built and upgraded and made perfect sense.  And a mostly useless matter manipulator.  CF still doesn't know how to address this problem.  Most people completely ignore pick-axes now because you can't repair them and no one wants to build and carry 10 of them in inventory.  Many people (myself included) jump right to /admin and upgrade the MM to full use right up front and just get on with the game.

starbound,3bbwoe,spudboy555,5,Sat Jun 27 21:54:32 2015 UTC,"Probably because they had to establish a base game first, so they made a ""good enough"" system which they knew they would revisit. Scriptable weapons are coming alongside the next combat update for Starbound."

starbound,3bdz4y,ZeroKaion,2,Sun Jun 28 09:05:08 2015 UTC,"Chucklefish is already working on 'paths' through the game, not in the sense that you are talking about but I think it will create a similar effect.  They are working on making it so you can choose a storyline to play through, like you could be a warrior or a farmer or a landlord, and you can play through a whole storyline by doing one of those things.  That also means, as a side-affect, people who are farmers probably don't have super awesome weapons because they hang out on their farm instead of going to dangerous planets to search for loot. So farmers are going to have a hard time exploring dangerous dungeons unless they have a friend who is a really good warrior.  I think this organic 'path' system is a lot more fair to players and it wouldn't make the game feel as linear as your suggested path system would."
starbound,3bdz4y,SupaSlide,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:06:09 2015 UTC,The point of this system I suggested was not to divide players. It was mostly to add small fun perks some can have over others like opening a secret door using science or exploration and get bonus loots. Exploring dungeons should not be locked to a path. The farmer having problems doing dungeons might be an issues on Chucklefish system.
starbound,3bdz4y,SupaSlide,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:24:13 2015 UTC,"You misunderstood my comment. I never suggested locking dungeons to a certain path. I was just saying that the way Chucklefish is designing the game is to encourage people do certain activities and excel in that area, but if a farmer suddenly wanted to go off and be a pirate, he could do that without much hassle. He wouldn't have to level up anything, he would just have to go find a good weapon to deal with baddies and gather up fuel for his ship. In the system I think Chucklefish is developing they are just encouraging you to follow a certain path, in your system as I understand it you are enforcing rules that make people follow their specific path."

It seems like the majority of people agree with that timetable or think it will take even longer, but it also got downvoted, so make of that what you will.

starbound,3bgyrb,Mackinz,2,Mon Jun 29 03:30:29 2015 UTC,"Varixai linked his estimations of update releases in his comment above/below, and I agree with that timeline because CF seems to focus on two major updates at a time.   Currently, they are split between the Colony and Combat updates. They have the basics of both down, but Combat needs more work so it is being released after Colony.   But, after the Colony update is released, the devs working on the Colony update will then, probably, focus their attention on the Vehicle update. When the Combat update is released, then those devs will switch Story update (okay, maybe not really, since the devs working on the Combat update seem to be coders so they will probably switch to the Vehicle update and others will be assigned to the Story).  Yadda yadda, etc., etc.  Long story short, I think a year till ""1.0"" is a good estimation."

starbound,3bd4zy,Lynixai,7,Mon Jun 29 06:39:48 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, certain loading scenes might set him off depending on how sensitive he is.  The first and most common loading screen he would see is when teleporting, there is a circle that pulses in and out and may or may not be a problem, but it is worth mentioning.  The second and probably much more serious one is when traveling on your ship to a new planet. This would happen less often than teleporting but it would still happen a lot. It isn't really a loading screen because you're still able to move around your ship but in the background the stars are flashing behind you ship as you fly past them, causing for a pretty flashy light show.  I would suggest going on youtube and watching a recent lets play, you should easily be able to see the teleporting loading screen, and probably the flying screen as well."

In Spore you can visit previously generated planets, but you'll never end up on the same world. Don't Starve starts entirely new world if you'll die, you can't restart nor revisit your previous location (at least, that was true when I first played it at launch). Terraria just allows you to make a new world and use any character with it. Simple and convenient.  Shall I continue or it's obvious where this is going? :)"

""Randomly Generated New Worlds: Want a new map? No problem! At any time you can generate a new living and breathing world that hates you and wants you to die.""

However, your turrets will shoot them.  They should last forever if they aren't killed for some reason.  The NPCs from the spawner will wander near their homes, I can't remember if the spawner NPCs open doors themselves or not. They do have a tendency to get themselves killed though.  In general, you want them to be kind of blocked off or separated from danger. Usually I have them inside structures, with turrets a little ways outside to kill monsters before they get near the structure.        Info on NPCs spawned in with an admin command instead of a spawner:  http://starbounder.org/Spawn_NPC_Command  They sort of last forever, I know spawned monsters can despawn after a while, or if you get too far away I think.. Not sure about NPCs though.  As for their behavior, it very much depends on the type of NPC. Guards act differently than villagers, and those both act differently than just pure enemies. The mission NPCs have some of the most varied behaviors. I noted a lot of this on the wiki page.  Though, almost all of this is going to change whenever the next update comes (4-6 weeks). The NPC system is getting a massive overhaul in preparation for Colonies. On the Nightly, there are already many different ""classes"" of NPCs, such as Base, Merchant, Villager, Follower, Guard, etc.  I'll have to rewrite everything on the wiki when that is closer to Stable, to detail the new system."

Most tags should be guessable from the appearance, race and origin of the object. We're aiming for a system where you don't ever need to have an npc of a particular type, but if you fill a house with sciencey stuff, you'll probably get a scientist.

starbound,3b6pqz,Ichthus95,11,Fri Jun 26 16:26:05 2015 UTC,"It's harsh but I think it's necessary. Try to think about it from a game design perspective. It breaks combat because you can close any gap instantly. Why use a long range weapon when you could use a more powerful sword and just teleport to your enemy? It also breaks platforming tremendously. Every jump based challenge becomes a cake walk. Aside from that it negates almost every other movement based tech to a degree. The only way I could see it staying is if it had a huge range nerf, I mean like only a few blocks. It's a great ability and I know a lot of people will hate to see it go/get nerfed, but it really breaks so many aspects of the game that it causes more harm than good."

There is a nice and easily navigable room, but the door opens only when the lava gets to a certain level (through the use of invisible liquid detectors to wire the door).  Through the use of wired drains and liquid spawning blocks behind doors, you could make little puzzles that leave the control of liquid levels in the hands of players, so they have to weight down their needs vs their ease of movement. (now I think that blocks with buoyancy would be a great addition to the game... Well, maybe someday in the future)  I am really looking forward to the day your creations hit stable.

Anyways, I designated several sections for my crafting and whatnot, an area for cargo, my personal residential and storage area, a living quarters for crew, and dining/entertainment area for everyone.

starbound,3b5z3f,Mackinz,3,Fri Jun 26 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"Basics of getting started in Starbound:  Step 1) Mine Core Fragments to restore ship engine for intra-stellar travel. Make sure to mine Iron Ore and make Iron Armor for protection (also save some Iron Bars for later), and to also upgrade your Matter Manipulator for liquid collection.  Step 2: Use the captains chair to fly to and teleport to the nearby gate-like structure you see on the space map.   Step 3: Once there, go interact with the gate and teleport to the Outpost, where you will see the main hub of activity in Starbound and interact with a number NPCs to obtain quests.  Step 4: Complete these quests, the first of which are very simple and serve as a tutorial to the game. Eventually, you will be recieve a quest from a scientist-looking Apex (Ape race) which will ask you to obtain Steel Armor.  Step 5 : Travel to a nearby Desert Planet and harvest Oil using your Matter Manipulator. You may have to explore it a bit, or dig underground to find some. This is okay. Once you have this Oil, you can make Steel Bars with Iron Bars and Oil at an Alloy Furnace  (crafted at an Iron Crafting Table).  Step 6: With your new Steel Armor, go back to the Outpost and talk to the Apex scientist again to receive your first Mission, which, when completed will give you Erchius Crystals which you will use to repair your ships' FTL (Faster Than Light) engine and enable inter-stellar travel. Be wary though, as this mission is no pushover to someone who hasn't experienced it once or twice (it is rather fun, though)."

starbound,3b4gue,quiqksilver,4,Thu Jun 25 22:14:19 2015 UTC,"Probably isn't going to be as large as I initially thought. It is true that they are very focused on a few areas right now like NPC AI and Behaviors that makes for really massive changelogs that are hard to translate into a list like this. (24,000+ lines in the changelog compressed to about 3 lines here..)  Here's a very limited/incomplete list though, none of these have links and other niceties that I'll put later. (mostly after I upload all of them to the wiki)   Continued work on NPC behaviors and animations (hundreds of changes) Hundreds of changes to all types of NPC and Monster AI (combat, pathing, wandering, hounding the player, etc.) New ""Dialog"" asset folder that has the dialogue for every NPC type Every single NPC got a pass that removed hundreds of unused lines, including dialogue and old stats. (5 test NPCs were removed in this pass, and 2 new ones added) Small economy and description pass on many Nightly items Almost all small farmables now only take up 1 block when planted Bird and Fish critter AI got improved Continued work on new Forest, Lush, and Desert microdungeons (with focus now on Desert) Continued work on updating Mushroom Patch and Spring mini-biomes. The starter planet has now been changed to Desert. I think this confirms that they are only changing the starter planet for testing purposes. It should go back to Lush before this update hits Unstable/Stable. Similarly, planet layers and mini-biomes were altered in odd ways, like making every main biome appear on every planet type, which has to be for testing right? (ex. A Jungle planet can have a Volcanic mini-biome) A new Glitch Underground Maze microdungeon (Seems to be a good size too, it has over 48 parts to it) 125+ materials got their zlevels set (which determines which block appears in front of another, when placed near each other) (many had other small changes, like names and descriptions) 8 new Challenge Rooms (30 different ones now, they want at least 20 more before launch) 8 new critters, many of which now spawn in several mini-biomes New blocks/tiles: Cabin Log, Cabin Roof, Stone Pillar You automatically know the recipe to craft the Cabin Log block. Unconfirmed BUG: When you try to mine the Cabin Log block it gives you a Stone Pillar instead. Unconfirmed BUG: Placing a piece of Shroom furniture causes you to get stuck in the next teleporting animation. Continued work on the Floran mission (boss and its minions, Nuru, other NPCs) The new settling snow is now hydrophobic, meaning that it can be displaced/uprooted by water (rain) And of course.. a lot of new Forest and Desert parallaxes that have been shown in the blogs.   None of this includes all of the new weapons that metadept has made, since he is on a separate 'feature branch'.   Speaking of which, the drone from today's blog is controlled by the player clicking and dragging the mouse cursor. I asked metadept if we would get versions that are armed (combat drone) or where the camera stays with the drone as it flies around (recon drone), here are his responses:   Camera probably not, because I'm still not convinced that's even remotely (ha ha) a good idea, and there's no support for it currently.  Making it armed would be fine but I don't know if it makes sense for vanilla and I wouldn't make it a projectile if I were going to do that.

Neither game is objectively 'better' because no person is capable of experiencing it in anything other than a subjective manner. And that is okay.   The time you're planning to spend in fruitless oneupmanship would probably be spent so much better just enjoying the game.

I used that key a lot, and it was fun to play with.  In Giraffe they forced the walk state when character is holding an item or weapon and facing the side opposite to cursor. If the character does not hold anything, this ""mechanic"" is entirely ignored and your avatar runs at full speed.  It is possible to mod by altering default_actor_movement.config and patching walkSpeed variable with ""14.0"" instead of ""8.0"", but you'll lose the ability to walk slowly."

starbound,3b5sgs,Nidmorr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:45:06 2015 UTC,"Suggestion:  Movement (via ASWD etc) could override the ""facing the mouse cursor"" mechanic. However, using (E) a weapon etc would override everything else.  In other words, say you have your cursor to the right of your character, and you start running left. You'd run left at full speed since you have no real reason to look to the right. As soon as you use something like a gun (while still running left), the character's focus shifts to the cursor, for aiming etc, and therefore needs to run/walk backwards.  This would let you ""aim"" while running, but then switch quickly and automatically between running and shooting, keeping slowdown to a minimum.  IOW/TL;DR - Don't have chars face the cursor unless/until an item is actually being used."
starbound,3b5sgs,ulodetero,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:28:00 2015 UTC,"It already works like this. If your hands are empty, your character will not track the cursor and can run in either direction of the cursor.  You can use the 'X' key to hot swap between empty spaces on your hotbar and your in-hand slots, if that makes sense, to do effectively what you described."
starbound,3b5sgs,zsixtyfour,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"effectively what you described   Almost, but not quite. I'm suggesting that the character not track the cursor unless and until an item (eg: gun) is actually being used.  So you could have a gun in your hand and run left while aiming right, then shoot when the cursor is in the right place, making you briefly turn to face the cursor and walk backwards, then immediately (automatically) return to running left, as long as you're still holding the Left button."
starbound,3b5sgs,ulodetero,2,Fri Jun 26 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"In that situation, even though the player is not using the item, the character is because he has to physically aim the gun, and look where he is aiming. So he still cannot run backward at full speed."
starbound,3b5sgs,BombshellMcJenkins,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but   This makes for better gameplay, imo In my mind, in this situation, you could see that 'aiming' as a kind of mental preparation before performing a snap-shot.   Bear in mind also that - in this suggestion -  if the player were to hold down Left and the mouse button, the char would stay facing the cursor the whole time while shooting as rapidly as he can. As soon as the mouse button is released, the char would continue running left even though the cursor is behind him.  No emptying hands or switching gear required."

When the hunger system is reimplemented, idling anywhere would cause your hunger meter to drop.  As a person who does a lot of chatting in IMs and live chat programs, I would absolutely love a return of the pause function in single player.  And the return of the ""random"" button on the ship's navigation console."
starbound,3b0q68,WhiteRhinoPSO,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:59:17 2015 UTC,"Well if your spot is saved when you exit to main menu now, you could just exit to menu. It takes 1-2 seconds to load back up. It's starting the software that's slow.  But who knows, maybe they've got the hunger/temp designed to move much slower? Or sleeping in a bed may stop its decreases?"
starbound,3b0q68,jambox5,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:40:39 2015 UTC,"Exiting to the main menu and then reloading your character does take longer than simply hitting escape to pause a game. It's not a huge increase in time, but if you have to pause often, then it does build up.  As it stands, when I hear the chime to let me know someone has said something to me, I end up waiting until my character is in a more safe location before I alt-tab to respond. Sometimes I end up forgetting that someone has messaged by the time I get there, though."
starbound,3b0q68,WhiteRhinoPSO,8,Fri Jun 26 13:45:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind hunger but having food rot and not be stackable will definitely something I will mod out.  Not stackable means more trips back and forth to the ship (blatant time sink) food rotting means you have to make food more often instead of exploring. (another time sink).  Alot of games have done this in the past to stretch the game out for more ""100+ hours of gameplay!"" ad value but it's crap.  Don't put crap in a game just to stretch out the gameplay time.  It's not fun IMHO."
starbound,3b0q68,Kittani77,6,Thu Jun 25 13:38:53 2015 UTC,"I was feeling the same way. Hopefully there's freeze-dried or sealed non-perishable food options.  I think I'd be okay with having high-tier buffing food items not stack (eg: something that heals for 150, fills hunger more than 50%, and boosts speed) so that you keep one or two in your inventory as an emergency power-up, but just a simple barely-satisfying item should stack to a small amount. A compromise would be that it can't stack to 1000 like most other items, rather it's limited to 25-50 or so. This way you can't make a lifetime supply in a single slot, but having enough to venture out for a few hours doesn't take up your entire inventory."
starbound,3b0q68,Klepto666,4,Thu Jun 25 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"I think it not being stackable is a necessity of it rotting. Say you have two cakes or something. One you just made and one you made awhile ago. If they stack then it's unclear which is older and if you go to grab one from the stack how do you specify which one you want? Keeping it separate lets them decay at different rates and you can specify exactly which you want.  I do agree though, I'd much rather just not have food spoil at all. Here you have high tech space pockets that can hold 1000's and 1000's of blocks of dirt and technology that allows you to teleport across the entire galaxy instantly yet nothing to keep food from spoiling? Why not just teleport the food to some subspace freezer? And if your pockets can hold ice in addition to dirt and keep the ice frozen, then it should be able to easily keep food fresh. I don't mind hunger, but rotting food is needless micromanagement."
starbound,3b0q68,Ewokitude,2,Thu Jun 25 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"Don't Starve just averages the freshness of the whole stack, which is a good way to handle it. Sure I can add a nearly-rotten carrot to my fresh stack and: all basically fresh! But it's really not a big deal.  I'm supportive of the devs' decision to make food not stack. They took hunger out before because it was tedious and pointless. It's being re-added to increase the survival aspects, not to make living annoying. Minecraft did this well, with hunger not going down from time, but from actions. So if you're standing still, hunger doesn't go down."
starbound,3b0q68,ZoomBoingDing,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:40:23 2015 UTC,It would be better if you just don't lose hunger while standing still. This would allow anyone to pause in a safe location without needing to log out

starbound,3b0q68,WhiteRhinoPSO,7,Fri Jun 26 13:06:45 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem.  In pretty much every other single player game out there, when you hit Escape and the menu pops up, the game is paused.  For those of us who don't play a lot of multiplayer, escape = pause.  It's happened several times in the past that I've hit escape to pause my game and then gone off somewhere and come back a while later to find my character long dead.  This isn't laziness, it's a very reasonable expectation of having a user interface that's consistent with literally every other single player game out there."

It's more likely that they're designing the singleplayer and multiplayer very closely together and would rather not deal with one having any features that the other doesn't have.  Returning to the main menu and then loading back into the game takes time. For a person like me who has to pause often because a friend posted a reply or sent an IM, that can get annoying in a hurry. It's the same reason why I shy away from playing any fullscreen-only game that takes up three or four seconds each time I alt-tab between them and the desktop.  It's one thing to say you don't need a pause button, or try to explain your opinion as to why others shouldn't care about it. There's no need to be a jerk about it."

Nightly addresses this issue quite significantly, actually. The randomly generated weapons look awesome and the new damage-affected-by-armor stat makes alnost all weapons equally viable at all tiers.   Tons and TONS of sets of armor.   Starbound does not offer a ton of actual armors, but has a lot of vanity armors and a vanity slot for each armor type, allowing for a lot of character customization. Only problem is that there is no vanilla/legitimate way to access dyed armor, making it feel like there is less variety than there actually is.   Different types of weapons: Swords, Daggers, Spears, Boomerangs, Guns, Explosives, different kinds of magic, Axes, etc. There's a wide variety of gear.    Starbound has most of those weapon types already. Not boomerangs, but those may end up being an addition in Pleased Giraffe because of the renovation of the item system.

Anything from boots that give you double jump, to a shield that protects against most debuffs, to a pair of wings that lets you fly and prevents fall damage. All kinds of stuff.

I believe it was over 200 block types last I checked and the new update (dropping on the 30th) will add even more.   In Terraria, however, obtaining this supposed variety of blocks is much more annoying than the accessible materials in Starbound. The good-looking blocks are difficult to obtain, and this is not good for builders. Plus... it's not like buildings are anything more than decor given how easily ignored they are by monsters in Terraria...   Many block types even have furniture that goes with it allowing you create themed rooms.   And this is the case in Starbound too."
starbound,3b4hs3,Mackinz,3,Fri Jun 26 05:05:23 2015 UTC,"Oh! Are we doing this? Because I said    NOW MIND YOU THIS ISN'T TO DISCREDIT STARBOUND Starbound is just in it's infancy in terms of it's existence. Terraria has had quite some time to establish this base of content and material to enjoy. It's been around significantly longer than Starbound and is more focused on the user content and less on exploring like Starbound is.   But if we're gonna do this. Let's go.   Nightly addresses this issue quite significantly, actually. The randomly generated weapons look awesome and the new damage-affected-by-armor stat makes alnost all weapons equally viable at all tiers.   Looks are opinion based. Almost all weapons equally viable at all tiers is not a good thing for balancing when you have multiple tiers of armor. You need weapons that are better or worse. Else the player will get bored of never needing a ""better"" weapon.    Starbound does not offer a ton of actual armors, but has a lot of vanity armors and a vanity slot for each armor type, allowing for a lot of character customization. Only problem is that there is no vanilla/legitimate way to access dyed armor, making it feel like there is less variety than there actually is.   Compared to Terraria, which is what we're doing here, Starbound has far less content when it comes to armor and dyes. Pre-1.3 update Terraria has 46 base sets of Armor. 49 if we include console exclusive. 55 if we include ""Wizard"" armor. 56 if we include the console exclusive ""Wizard"" armor as well. I'm not even going to count the Vanity items/sets but there's a ton. Combine with with all the Dyes and it's kinda insane how much customization there is compared to base Starbound. (Note I said base: Not cheated as that's the version most players are going to see)   Starbound has most of those weapon types already. Not boomerangs, but those may end up being an addition in Pleased Giraffe because of the renovation of the item system.   Nor does it have Flails, Crossbows, Magic weapons of the same degree (I know we're getting some, but they're not in yet nor do they have quite the variety yet) Nor summoning weapons, yes you can capture and resummon pets but that's not the same nor is it any use right now.    Random buffs found on randomly generated armor would be interesting, but I never liked the Accessories in Terraria. In Starbound, armor isn't weak and mobility is much more interesting because of technology.   Heavily opinion based. I'm not goin off opinions currently. Going off as objective as I can right now. Armor in Terraria isn't weak either. In-fact late game heavier armor is pretty much a must. As far as mobility, grapples, wings, jet packs, hoverboards, jet boots, teleports, reverse gravity potions, etc. There's a lot of ways to get around Terraria. Of which Starbound only has a few, but hopefully expanding upon and adding more to each.   In Terraria, however, obtaining this supposed variety of blocks is much more annoying than the accessible materials in Starbound.   Elaborate?    The good-looking blocks are difficult to obtain, and this is not good for builders. Plus... it's not like buildings are anything more than decor given how easily ignored they are by monsters in Terraria...   There's a few creatures that can ignore terrain yes, but that's why you don't fight those enemies near your buildings. Also the bosses in SB ignore terrain now don't they? After everyone lamed out the Penguin before by building shelters or by encasing it in dirt. As far as difficult to obtain, elaborate on that one? Lastly, regarding ""anything more than decor"", in Starbound it's more? Because last I checked I could just beam back to my expanded ship and not need to build anything, ever. I could build a small settlement, but it'd be better just to set up a teleporter and just take things back to my ship. Yes rental properties are going to become a thing, but currently they aren't. So currently SB's buildings are little more than decor.   And this is the case in Starbound too.   Not to such an extreme. Many block types lack full furniture sets in Starbound. I can't exactly make my work bench out of different types of wood. I can't make beds out of different kinds of wood. I can't make doors out of different kinds of materials. Etc. Terraria has it to a greater extreme.  TO POINT THIS OUT AGAIN I am not saying Starbound is worse because of any of this I am saying that Terraria has had more time to grow and add in all this content comparatively to Starbound. Starbound will grow to great things like Terraria has, but it needs time to do so. Out of the gate at 1.0 it won't have more content then Terraria has now. However Terraria has also had 4 years to grow, Starbound isn't even actually ""Out"" yet. It's in early access. Once it's released, then we can start the ""It has 4 years to surpass/catch up to Terraria"" counter if you really want to. I know I won't be doing that though."

A variety in looks, is not variety in weapons. Sure there's a million different looking swords, but they all swing the same with 1 of 4 possible effects. When they add in 20+ possible effects to each weapon, then I'll say it is on par with Terraria.   Maybe less on the psychic side of things, and more on the hammerspace or warping side of things.   I can't locate the post right now, but there is in-fact psychic techs being used as the replacement for magic. I'll try and hunt down the post about it.   Honestly, not that far. I couldn't stand the boss grinding, and mining to get better minerals was actually more boring than in Starbound... and that's saying a lot. ._.   I'm going to assume you weren't playing right. Because you shouldn't need to grind bosses early on. Like, at all. Maybe fight the eye or eater twice but that'd be it. In hardmode you can grind bosses, but pre-hardmode you should never need to. Unless you're trying for Bee armor or trying to get the Ninja Vanity set.  As far as mining, again you're doing something wrong. Because yea it's faster in Starbound, but there's a whole lot of nothing underground in Starbound. Literally nothing.   All of the currently implemented ones, including Dreadwing (the UFO). Summoning them to you instead of going to them always felt more Terraria-like and boring, IMO. Still easy to get to them, though. You just gotta progress through quests to unlock the mission, then activate the mission from your SAIL.   Yea, that's all kinda of lame IMO. I much prefer being able to fit it my way instead of being told ""OK fight it like this in this place."" Also having to run through a mission first is 2x lame IMO."

starbound,3ayd10,Sporkfortuna,14,Wed Jun 24 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"Food slowly rots over time, the more rotten it is, the sicker it can make you/give you damage.  But if you have a fridge, it decays MUCH slower."

Does that not suffice as limitation?"
starbound,3ayd10,Ende_schon_heute,4,Wed Jun 24 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"Well if they're going to implement some survival aspects they may as well make the survival experience as good as it can be, which includes not being able to instantly teleport away whenever you're in any danger.

starbound,3ayd10,Russeru,7,Wed Jun 24 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"Your second paragraph I would subscribe to.  The first one is a little vague as there's still the problem of defining what would be beneficial for an ""as good as it can be"" survival experience. I wouldn't want SB to be about survival at all. I want adventure, exploration, a goal to move forward to, a neat-o spaceship to call my home and total freedom in choosing, whether or not I would choose a planet to settle (which would most likely be never, anyway). There are other games out there that support that survival experience much better and are explicitly build around mechanics that make playing survival style worthwhile or challenging, and I'd play those if I ever wanted that."
starbound,3ayd10,Ende_schon_heute,2,Wed Jun 24 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"That's totally valid, and is why all the survival stuff is gonna be in a separate mode. I don't think they're planning on spending an incredible amount of time on the survival stuff (there's no ""survival update"" planned, it was just mentioned in passing as like a bonus feature).  Personally I don't really like games that are solely focused on survival since there's usually not much to do once you become self-sufficient. But with Starbound there's a potentially infinite amount of cool stuff to do. That's why the survival stuff interests me, although I agree that the game should focus on what it's good at: fun and exploration."
starbound,3ayd10,Russeru,3,Wed Jun 24 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"It would be appropriately space-future-y if the ability to teleport was resource limited, so you could add more capacitors to your ship to get lower cooldown, but you'd need more fuel to recharge."
starbound,3ayd10,FeepingCreature,4,Wed Jun 24 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah well, then one could at least bind that process to resources like pixels or fuel ores but not time.  Even though I find that capacitator idea to be quite nice if there ever were some cooldown period between teleports. Upgradable teleporters might be nice as well! Perhaps even some distance restriction so you couldn't traverse half a galaxy at once."

A mechanic to deal with it would be something like Project Zomboid's (already mentioned) system of Cooking skill where you can salvage some nutrition from rotten food, or make advanced dishes that last longer / give more food / use new ingredients to satisfy hunger. However, even there the hunger mechanic is a huge chore and doesn't pose a challenge in the endgame, it just forces you to spend 50 % of your play time playing farmville and balancing food spoilage times."

Nobody will pay you much for wilted food.  And it is a needed mechanic for the survival enthusiasts. Balancing inventory space between supplies, tools and free space is one of the more immersive aspects of this kind of experience. The need to plan ahead, improvise and be rewarded when you make an accurate prediction of your near-future needs is what really makes ""survival"" engaging, not the simple need to eat something every X minutes.  I am really hoping they make not only foods with varying degradation timers, but also some food options that make you choose between sustenance and reliability. Canned food could give you diminishing returns if repeteadly consumed (satisfying your hunger less and less), but have an almost infinite time before rotting begins. Smaller fruits could be stacked up to limited numbers, but would rot kinda fast.  I really like the idea."

As for foods spoiling... Well, you can always make them only as needed, or avoid them entirely. It's not like food has much impact in the game as of now. If you just like having one of every item in the game because of some base hoarding instinct (and I can relate to that, seriously), you can always hope that they'll create containers that halts food degradation to go along with the food update."

In fact, I'm already quite familiar with this mechanic from a Minecraft total conversion mod called TerraFirmaCraft. On that note, will the various planetary climates effect crop and crop growth? Will the refrigerator and refrigerator-like storage furniture reduce the accumulation of rot-over-time for food-based items?"

In TFC, the player can make clay vessels which can (in the context of food) hold four items. Though it's been a while since I played TFC I don't quite remember if keeping food in vessels slowed decay levels, but I do know it's four pieces of food for one inventory slot.  Anyway, if Chucklefish were to do the same, I'm envisioning something along the lines of a lunchbox and/or a handheld cooler, able to carry enough food for long trips for a single person."
starbound,3ayd10,NeoFoxx000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:21:49 2015 UTC,But you can still carry 999 uranium ore in the same inventory space (or in TFC terms I think 16m³ of stones in the same space that one loaf of bread takes).
starbound,3ayd10,Avohaj,25,Fri Jun 26 09:46:43 2015 UTC,"<Tiy> hunger will return, but food wont be stackable anymore, and it will rot over time   I dislike all three of these things :("
starbound,3ayd10,TheBigKahooner,25,Wed Jun 24 15:23:18 2015 UTC,For the higher difficulty levels. Just play on easy and you can avoid it :)
starbound,3ayd10,Roarkewa,20,Wed Jun 24 15:36:39 2015 UTC,"There's one thing though:  I, for my part, don't want hunger and rotting food as part of my game, yet dropping ores upon death is still a good punishment in my opinion, so ""normal"" difficulty it is for me. I don't want dropping ores bundled with having to mindlessly press a button after X amount of time passed (and clogging up valuable inventory space with otherwise useless items as well!).  Why not have a checkbox in the character creation screen labled   ""Hunger / food spoiling []active []inactive"" ?   THAT would satisfy anyone and noone would have to live with a mechanic they don't like even on higher difficulties. Make it completely optional, please!"
starbound,3ayd10,Ende_schon_heute,7,Wed Jun 24 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with the idea that it should be a separate checkbox. Mainly because I would like to play around with the hunger system on the casual difficulty, but also for those that want the permadeath adrenaline without having to concern themselves with hunger. Something like the ""Survival"" game mode on Fallout: New Vegas, that was not connected to difficulty settings.  The only problem here is the food spoiling mechanic. I don't think it can be changed with a checkbox, as food is an entity separate from your characters. They exist in your universe. And the universe is set up so characters from multiple difficulty settings can coexist. Unless food decay is only active when in a character's inventory (and thus subject to that character's settings), I don't see it being optional at all.  I do like the idea, but for the sake of people who don't, we can hope they'll implement this mechanic in a sensible manner, as flexibly as possible."
starbound,3ayd10,Tsuruda,5,Wed Jun 24 17:55:19 2015 UTC,"So, even if food did spoil without hunger, which, as you described, may very well be, there's still the possibility to sell it in order to turn a profit.   Thanks for bringing this up however, as spoiling food would thus add urgency to selling it, making the farming progression path a little more adventurous. Nice!  Insofar I'd still want hunger to be optional, even if it meant enduring spoiling food."
starbound,3ayd10,Ende_schon_heute,3,Wed Jun 24 18:07:00 2015 UTC,I totally agree! I posted a suggestion a while ago and I still hope it'll get implemented one day.
starbound,3ayd10,MrTreazer,2,Wed Jun 24 19:17:26 2015 UTC,Oh I didn't see that part. That's a relief!
starbound,3ayd10,TheBigKahooner,3,Wed Jun 24 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"Why the hell wouldnt food be stackable?  Unless hunger is not very serious at all, it makes little sense to make it not stackable."
starbound,3ayd10,IngwazK,12,Wed Jun 24 15:35:08 2015 UTC,I want to say it's a way of making it an actual issue when exploring planets. Since before you could have a giant stack of rice and it suddenly didn't matter. So now hopefully you'll need to plan your exploration.
starbound,3ayd10,Kite-tacular,17,Wed Jun 24 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. It was too easily negated just by carrying stacks of food before, which made hunger as a mechanic feel a little pointless. Now you can still carry around a whole bunch of food if you really want to, but it's not such an easy decision as you'll be giving up space."
starbound,3ayd10,Supernorn,2,Wed Jun 24 16:14:00 2015 UTC,That's a fair cop.
starbound,3ayd10,Artie-Choke,7,Wed Jun 24 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"Rice is great when I'm hungry and I want 5000 of something. ""Stacking"" rice makes sense; stacking watermelons, not so much."
starbound,3ayd10,KungFuHamster,6,Wed Jun 24 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"If one item = one portion it doesn't really make sense. Unless you're also clicking 5000 times to eat all those individual rice grains, at which point I think I'd rather have that one watermelon."
starbound,3ayd10,TurbulentDescent,4,Wed Jun 24 17:53:03 2015 UTC,It was an extreme example. Pancakes and steaks should stack. A side of beef should not.
starbound,3ayd10,KungFuHamster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"Technical constraint most likely, where each food item has its own decay value. That kind of thing can't realistically be remembered in a stack."
starbound,3ayd10,quiteoblivious,3,Thu Jun 25 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"I am looking forward to all the things they'll make specifically to store food. A high tech cryo box that virtually ceases food degradation  but has very limited slots and high production cost and lower tech alternatives like fridges and such. Varying decay times depending on the food would be fun too (Canned Food/Rations/McFries -> too long to care or just doesn't decay for game purposes. Bananas rot in 10 in game minutes).  Also, the hype is high for vehicles and colonization."
starbound,3ayd10,Tsuruda,2,Wed Jun 24 17:41:37 2015 UTC,Where do the progression improvements fit into this? I assume the progression stuff comes before 1.0!

starbound,3ayd10,XAA5,2,Wed Jun 24 22:27:04 2015 UTC,What about the pre-order incentives? Pets were described as customizable and it seemed like we had an option as to what pet we wanted. Fossils need to be added in as well. u/tiyuri

They will probably add those into one of the Stable updates at some point.

starbound,3ayd10,Tiyuri,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:16:25 2015 UTC,"Yea, a lot of people do want to be able to customize them more. We will have pets that we can customize though, just not the ship (starter) pets. Here are Tiyuri's thoughts on it. (2 source comments here)   These are ship pets, companions you get to know through circumstance rather than choice. These pets just happened to be in the ship you fled with. In the case of humans, that could be the last cat in the universe! Given the destruction of earth.  You will be able to catch other pets, but limiting these pets to the ship where they don't have to follow you or worry about getting lost means we can do a great deal more with them behaviour wise than captured pets.  They will interact with captured pets if they're brought on board though :)  Given that we wanted these to be pets you meet we're not going to enable you to choose which pet you have. We want them to exist in the world as seperate entities you become attached to rather than another of your creations. However we might add the ability to influence the pet over time through interaction, time permitting.     Player: No pet customization? that kinda sucks IMO   Sorry, this is the way I think it works best"
starbound,3ayd10,Tiyuri,4,Thu Jun 25 04:27:33 2015 UTC,"With this mini-roadmap, I would say a rough timetable looks like this:   August 5th - Colony Update (6 weeks from now) September 30th - Combat Update (8 weeks after Colony) December 9th - Vehicle Update (10 weeks after Combat) March 16th - Story update (14 weeks after Vehicle) April 20th - ""polish"" update (5 weeks after Story) June 1st - Launch update (6 weeks after polish)   All my own guesses, just trying to lay down a framework for you guys.  Edit: With all of these I was trying to account for the multitude of other features that will be crammed into each big update.

We’ve given vague estimates in the past that have turned out to be wrong– giving an accurate ETA for a game of Starbound’s size is hard!

What if you don't get enough preorders, will the game be unfinished? A. No, the Starbound is going to make it out in 2013 no matter what. But by preordering you help it get here even faster.   Seems pretty strong and absolute language to me... the fact that the game still isn't close to being done just means they were the kids and didn't know what they were doing; over promising, taking people's money, and under delivering."
starbound,3ayd10,Ende_schon_heute,0,Wed Jun 24 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not being a white knight, actually. I fully acknowledge that they are over schedule. However, there are many perfectly good and valid reasons for this.   They are not under-delivering at all. Being that I am currently modding and playing said product and am quite pleased with the progress thus far, I don't see your arguments as valid.   You can be dissatisfied all you like. But trolling on forums about it and calling people white-knights for daring to like the product or be satisfied with it? That's childish at best."
starbound,3ayd10,idg3t,-2,Wed Jun 24 20:16:34 2015 UTC,I paid for something that was advertised in a certain manner and what I got wasn't and still isn't even close (a lemon).  You are being a white knight. Claiming that I'm unjustified in my pursuit because you are perfectly happy is childish at best. shoo fly...
starbound,3ayd10,Ende_schon_heute,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"No, I am not being a white knight.   I said it's your right to be dissatisfied (and quite clearly, at that). I'm simply saying what your claims infer is completely inaccurate. The game isn't finished yet (a point against it, yes), and based on what I am seeing from MY early investment in the same product, while delays suck, is something quite close to what I was offered, but that has undergone some changes along the way. For the better. A few things that need to be added are yet to come, but they WILL come. Chucklefish has proven that despite early setbacks, they are fully on track now and are chugging along. Each update since has only increased the value of this product. Your failure to see said value is not my problem or anyone else's.   Your mileage may vary, fine. But don't go pushing that white-knight horse-shit on me, because it's stupid and false. I've waited my ass off for the game just like you. I'm simply able to realize that problems happen and it isn't necessarily any individual persons fault.  It's cute that you get so pissed off about a 15 dollar investment. Pissed off enough to troll a fucking sub-reddit for months about something you claim to not give a shit about. That, in and of itself, proves how much of a twit you like to be.  Take care of yourself. Maybe you can calm yourself with a nice rousing game of Solitaire. Or did that one fall short of it's early promises , too? I hear it doesn't even have multiplayer."

When I purchased, it was a pre-order with a feature complete date ""end of 2013"". Their FAQ page even boldly stated that if they didn't get enough pre-order money that the game would still make a 2013 release because it was that far along...  Guess what... 1 year and 6 months counting. Next time... keep your mouth shut if you don't know what you're talking about.

Yet still my point remains: Spilling all that vitriolic rhetoric over the place benefits noone. Not a single person. Keep your butthurt to yourself.   Guess what? I do enjoy this very much still unfinished game.   You're right, I never backed any crowdfunding campaign, was never promised anything and thus never had any sense of entitlement whatsoever towards the game or the developers. This is of course true, that I never really saw a ""table of promises"" made. But whatsoever, I won't ""keep my mouth shut"" because if there'S one thing I really dislike is people spewing hateful comments where there's no place for them. What do you hope to achieve that way? Retroactively accelerate a belated development process? Cast a whiplash to developers' backs to make them hurry up?  Your comment was written in ill spirit and you should know so.

At this point I won't go and change my comment to say ""pre-order"". There's definitely a difference, you're right with that, but that is the caveat with all pre-orders, ever.  tl,dr: He can, as far as I'm concerned, vent his frustration all he wants, as long as it's in appropriate places like that hate-thread.

(I know they cram in a ton of stuff into each update, they all stretch a bit long.) I mean, the only official word we got on when we are getting the very next patch was ""a few months"". (I actually got chastised by a dev then for giving too soon a timeframe..)  Even in Tiyuri's response here he gave no information whatsoever on estimated timetables.. All I wanted to do was give people some very rough dates so they can plan things and know what to expect. There are games that I am waiting on, and I find it very useful to know ""okay, so I can focus on this other game for 4 months until that update comes out"".. just helps with scheduling."

The fact that there are nearly daily posts and updates on the game and we can SEE progress in the form of a playable product (and one that works quite well) proves that it is NOT a lie/sham, and that you are full of shit , or full of yourself. Furthermore, they have steadily been adding in pretty much all the features they advertised. The order they do that in is up to them, and not you.

It's about the gross negligence that continues and the principle behind not getting what I paid for. I bought a pre-order of Starbound for 2013, not early access through 2016.  Why was my refund denied? because early on the launcher was bugged and counted play-time incorrectly. I haven't even launched Starbound for at least 8 months.

That's something my 5 year old does. Not a grown adult. Us adult folks? If we don't get a refund we certainly don't piss into the wind about it for a fucking year and a half and act like a bitch about it. No, we pack up and move on.  I've worked in this industry as well, and hate when projects get delayed. That doesn't change a thing, however. They moved offices, had to get visas for most of the staff they moved overseas, work out finances for all of that, find homes for all of that staff, and all the other stuff involved in that. Plus the usual dev-time struggles, staff changes etc... there are many factors at play. Factors you choose to ignore because it is inconvenient to you. And that's fine. They are late, and you have a right to bitch about it.  You simply shouldn't act like a baby about it, is all I am saying. And you sure as fuck shouldn't tell other people they cannot enjoy or defend the product or imply rudely about their character for doing so. Period. You're wrong to do it, you're wrong to assume anything otherwise, and you're a laughable excuse for an adult if this is how you choose to verbalize over something as trivial as a videogame and 15 bucks."

Also, the down time was about 1 month? That's barely 5% of the time I'm complaining about... try again.  I have never said someone can't enjoy their product, but I sure as fuck can speak my mind on the fact that they have screwed a lot of people, including myself.  You, on the other hand, are the one saying I should be happy with the shit they've given me... which seems hypocritical or childish at best... take your pick.  Oh, yeah... I have some awesome investment portfolios you should consider; maybe when I take your money and run, you'll just walk away instead of trying to track me down? Not likely.

starbound,3ayd10,wanderon1,2,Thu Jun 25 06:46:10 2015 UTC,"As a person who played sports and organized games in school, i can say 'yeah, there are some rules that are less popular than others,' but it doesn't stop sports and organized games from being played or hosted. People that aren't happy to watch or participate leave, and this is an actual normal aspect to life.  That said, i don't get where this ""if I can't play it the way i want, the devs/creators of the game are horrible people"" crowd came from. The devs have their own specific vision. If its not within your scope, then either cope with it or find something else to play.  Sure, hunger/thirst/exposure is kind of a chore, but it was in the original rules of the game, and will be returning after a brief hiatus. THe best way to deal with this is just automate how you cope with the system. Every time your character is hungry, you shouldn't be having an emotional meltdown. Just deal with it and keep playing."

starbound,3ayd10,FlightlessFallen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:50:23 2015 UTC,I hope one day they'll give melee weapons travel time. It's one of the things that's bugged me the longest with this game. How can you swing a giant hammer so fast it's instant?
starbound,3ayd10,Milguas,2,Wed Jun 24 19:32:12 2015 UTC,Funny you say that. Up until 2 months ago they did have much longer swing times. There was a mini combat update that made most of the melee weapons swing much faster.
starbound,3ayd10,Afrotoast42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:04:22 2015 UTC,"No they didn't. I've played this game since release.   I think you're thinking of swing speed. (how many times you can swing in a second)  What I'm talking about is different. I'm talking about the time it takes for a sword for example, to travel from the top of the characters head to the bottom of the swing distance. It's always been instant. They just add a little sprite on top that to make it seem like it traveled when it didn't. It just appeared at the end of where it was supposed to go.  Hmm. This is hard to explain...  Oh, I know. I'll explain it like this: In Starbound, there's always been only two positions of a weapon when attacking. One is above your head, and the other is near the ground when your character has finished swinging. There's no interpolation between those two positions. It's either one, or the other. Essentially, there's no swing animation at all."
starbound,3ayd10,MrLoque,2,Wed Jun 24 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"You're entirely correct. I've been dabbling with modding lately and there are three states to a weapon's attack animation. Idle, which is the weapon when it's just in your hand and you're running around. Wind-up, which is as you've said, when the weapon is held above your head, and Cooldown, which is the resting position at the end of the attack (notice with 2h weapons you'll hold it out a little before returning to the one-handed idle position).   For each of these there are lines of code determining the angle of the character's arm, and the X/Y position of the weapon's sprite in relation to the character's body. There are also lines which dictate the amount of time spent in both the wind-up and cooldown phase (see: attack speed).   Essentially right now melee is built around these 3 'frames', with a swoosh trail between windup and coodown to simulate movement (the code for the 'swoosh' handles the dimensions of the hitbox for the attack, as well) . Previous verisons had a longer wind-up on all the weapons which is what I think /u/Varixai was thinking of. I'd imagine it'd take another overhaul of melee combat to actually get something akin to terraria where the weapon and arm visibly swing to hit enemies. But who knows, that could come with the combat update."
starbound,3ayd10,riscles,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying now. Yea I would love a few more frames in that animation, you can't see the swing at all. You see slightly more in video that is slowed down a lot, but next to nothing in real time. It basically teleports to the end frame and flashes the swoosh graphic (which is also instant to the point of just flashing a single picture)."
starbound,3ayd10,quiteoblivious,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"Really love the plans.  However, there's one thing that i kinda don't feel so good about, and that thing is food being unstackable, unless it's an option, i can see it get annoying very fast because it will take up so much space in the inventory, unless there's like, a food pouch (?) that you can only store things like food into."
starbound,3ayd10,Milguas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:18:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind the hunger bar, it gave food and farming more of a purpose, but my opinion on the lack of stacking and the rotting will depend on how often I have to eat.  If half of my inventory has to be food just so I can mine for a decent amount of time, I will be modding that shit."
starbound,3ayd10,CraftedCrows,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"Hunger sucks. That kind of maintenance mechanic is not fun. To top it off, you're going to force it to be a constant bother rather than a once every few hours/days problem by making food rot. Please, please, please reconsider."
starbound,3ayd10,riscles,3,Thu Jun 25 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"You have no idea it will ""be a constant bother"". We are likely months away from it being reimplemented, it could be one piece of food every 2 hours for all you know, 4 hours if kept in a fridge, 20 hours in a freezer.  Also, it is optional. Play on Easy difficulty and there is no hunger system at all."

If you came back and played it right this second, I think you would have fun doing it. However, there are still quite a few placeholders and large features that are still being implemented. The next large update is due in about a month, then there are at least 4 major updates after that before the game is considered released/launched.  If you want to wait until it is released, it could be anywhere from 6 to 12 months."

starbound,3b1kam,ryvenn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"I've been away from the game for a long time and just started playing again. What the crud happened to pickaxe durability, and is there no longer a way to repair picks in the field?"
starbound,3b1kam,samuelhenderson,2,Tue Jun 30 10:07:51 2015 UTC,Pickaxes are deprecated in favour of the matter manipulator so they break super easy now and unfortunately there is no way to repair them.  If you are playing the Stable release I would advise ignoring pickaxes and instead focus on upgrading your Matter Manipulator.  If you are playing the Nightly release you'll find that upgrading the Matter Manipulator is a bit of a pain now too since the devs changed the upgrade system from needing metal bars to 'Manipulator Modules' which are semi-rare and only found in tech chests and storage pods.  Chuckelfish have said they still need to tweak the spawn rate of the modules so it will propbably get better in the future.  Until then I've been using this mod: [http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/repair-tools-upbeat-giraffe.2648/] which greatly increases pickaxe durability and allows you to once again repair with ores.
starbound,3b1kam,justbeast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:00:37 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember when playing Nightly is that Admin mode is pretty much a necessity (depending on the day, some major feature of the game is likely to be broken. (Like, the other day, using bandages crashed the game. But it was fixed a few days later). So you need Admin mode to just play).  And if you know how to use Admin mode, then you can fix annoyances like not having enough manipulator modules, if they really get to you."
starbound,3b1kam,samuelhenderson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, I don't think the Nightly build is intended for normal (normal as in never using /admin) play. For reference, what is the spawnitem name for the manipulator module?  Is there a list (or game data file) of spawnitem codes?  That being said, I'm still having loads of fun without using the /admin command.  I found 5 manipulator modules just getting to the core of my planet and haven't actually spent any time specifically searching for them."
starbound,3b1kam,justbeast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"The closest thing to a list of spawnitem codes is: http://starbounditems.herokuapp.com/ (s' what I generally use). It may not have some of the latest items in Nightly, but Varixai and company generally try to keep it updated.  I think the manipulator code is just 'manipulatormodule'. (I'm pretty sure I spawned some the other night, just by guessing)."

starbound,3au0bb,kyleblane,3,Tue Jun 23 15:19:32 2015 UTC,I used an item called Slime Drip Source. It's an invisible block found in Slime Caves that makes it appear to be dripping slime everywhere. You can't find it naturally but you can spawn it in with Admin mode.

starbound,3au1bw,quiqksilver,6,Tue Jun 23 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe a weaker spell that can be cast without channeling. Staves need more viability in fast paced and high-pressure situations, like boss fights and swarms of flying/jumping enemies.  It could be balanced so it has limited range and damage, maybe equal to some of the special effects from legendary melee weapons like the flying skull and energy sword, plus an energy cost, minus the melee swing."

starbound,3au1bw,quiqksilver,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:12:45 2015 UTC,I find the only good staff is the Avian gem one simply because of the sheer amount of damage it does and its large radius.

starbound,3au1bw,Serrel,3,Tue Jun 23 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"They look mouse-guided. Because first it looks like there is no way to select a target so that would be annoying, and second you can see one of the missiles miss one of the birds and pass right over the mouse."

I'm also hoping they change backward walking/strafing around a bit as using your mouse as a guide can sometimes lead it to be unnecessarily annoying at times.

British studio european standard.  If you mean about putting out fires then my 12 years in the army tells me we were pretty good at putting out fires. And had plenty of idiots around capable of starting them for the most insane reasons - like checking battery acid levels with a lighter. Turns out extinguishers are awesome.  confused.

I'm going to keep working on it over the weekend (adding all of the images from Ende~). The wiki page doesn't have any real formatting yet, but I will likely add spoiler frames like on the Tenant page, or do something else to trim the page a little.  It's taking slightly longer since I am taking the time to check the assets as I go, to keep track of exactly which ones we have found. So, on the wiki all of the images are named their actual names from the assets.  http://starbounder.org/Microdungeons"

starbound,3atdho,Varixai,2,Wed Jun 24 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, these will be helpful. I'll be cropping and adding them to the wiki.  I think you did well on the majority of them, but I would ask that you try to be outside of the microdungeon area when you take the screenshot. Perhaps using CTRL to move the camera over the dungeon. That way we can have the cleanest pictures of them.  Edit: And also try to save them as PNGs, but that might be a Starbound setting, I forget. I can compress the PNGs, and after cropping the PNGs are usually smaller size and better quality for these types of images  (Just friendly tips, is all I mean them to be)"
starbound,3atdho,Ende_schon_heute,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought that some of them might be off due to character placement. Keep in mind though, that most of those pics were taken just for fun and having little mementos of my journeys.  If I find some of the larger ones again, I'll try and take better pics and replace the ones in the gallery. But bear with me if I can't deliver on all of them. :-) However, camera panning is nothing new to me, as you might have seen in some pictures.

For right now you (and /u/Acataeono) are credited on the history page there. But I may add more somewhere else in the future. (wiki's aren't generally a place where credit like that is given on the main pages, usually just history pages)  I'm also still working on the format, it may switch to a gallery style in the future.. But for now the images are hidden by spoiler tags, to keep the page from being a mile long when you first go there.  Edit: All except for 2 images that are halves of the same large Avian Tomb.

They haven't said whether that will be a feature in the future, but I wouldn't count on it for quite a while. If they intended them to be capturable they would have just made the creature files like they did the rabbit.  You can spawn them in yourself though. I have heard that spawned in monsters have a tendency to despawn after a length of time, so that may be what you are referring to?  You can find their spawn names on the wiki here.

starbound,3alj2j,Car0b1nius,5,Sun Jun 21 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"As the server still has to pack up and load all assets, cutting down the asset file size will reduce load times. It depends a bit on how Starbound assets are compressed, but the server has to decompress all of them and that will go faster if the image files are smaller. Maybe not much faster, but combined with some other fixes it will have much more than ""absolutely no effect"".

You'll be able to pick them up with your Matter Manipulator like any other object.      (Source) I adore boating around on ocean planets.

starbound,3alaaf,Varixai,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I started from scratch yesterday and while building the outer door circuit I had the problem that the door opened a few times because the water level was being lowered by the opened door. I hope they will add the Delay Gate which is implemented in the Nightly to stable, this will make a delay so much prettier."
starbound,3alaaf,sbLora,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:26:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, I know that feel! Building a simple realistic airlock can be really easy, but it gets complicated when you start trying to wire up every little detail instead of realizing that some of them can work together. I have an easy, step-by-step tutorial in this video, at about 1:20: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn_hXMaCXtM  All told, this airlock uses 5 logic gates and a switch (if using Buttons for inputs. Hand scanners are a different story) and all 6 of these units can be placed / hidden far away if you like, leaving just 4 buttons and a beautifully working airlock.  The 3-gate circuits above the hand scanners are just to make the hand scanners work like buttons. If you don't care about that, just use buttons, but if you're curious about those circuits, check out the previous video in the series on my channel.  Hope this helps! :)  EDIT: Oops! Got caught not reading the entire original post. I didn't realize you wanted to use pumps, but they SHOULD work the same as the hatch doors above in my setup, the ones that let in the water. (Bear in mind, in the video as I'm wiring up the circuit, I'm standing on the ""ocean"" side. I let in the water at the end to make that clear, but it might not be obvious at the beginning.  EDIT2: For those who would rather read written instructions / didn't understand the video, here's what's going on / how I wire up the system. I've found this to be the most efficient use of logic gates, but if you spot any redundancies let me know!  Switch & NOT Gate: This is the only on/off state we need to worry about, it controls whether A) the water Doors / Pipes / Pumps are open (ON) or B) the Drains are open (OFF). First connect the Switch output to the NOT input. We then connect the output of the Switch to the mechanism being used to let in water, whether that's Doors or Gates or Pumps, and likewise connect the output of the NOT gate to the Drains. You can save this step for the end if it makes it hard to see your other wires. Finally, wire ALL of your SYSTEM INPUTS (Buttons, or whatever makes the Fill or Drain process ACTIVATE) to the Switch input. Remember, this needs to be a short pulse to flip the switch. In the current version of Starbound this pulse has to be at least 3-Ticks long (thanks SeaJayCJ!) so a 1-Tick Pulse won't do the trick here (for that we would need to replace the Switch with a simple D-Latch / NOT ""switch"" circuit) but the Button works fine, or if you prefer to use some kind of switch-like input (like the Hand Scanner or Retinal Scanner) please see my first tutorial video for an easy way to make that work! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoh2W0kSLpw  Door 1 Open: We want the first door (the ocean-side door) to open when the main switch is on AND a liquid sensor / pair of liquid sensors at the top of the chamber detect water. So we simply wire both of these things to an AND gate: Switch output -> AND input 1, Liquid Sensors -> AND input 2. Then just wire the AND output to the Door input.  Door 2 Open: We want the second door (dry side) to open when the main switch is off AND a liquid sensor / pair of liquid sensors at the bottom of the chamber do NOT detect water. So again, pretty simple. We wire a liquid sensor (or 2) at the bottom to a new NOT gate, then that NOT output -> AND input 1, Main Switch NOT output -> AND input 2.  Alarm (optional): Finally, if you want an alarm during fill / drain states, then we will want it to come on when both Doors are closed. So we place yet another NOt gate, wire both Door outputs -> NOT input, and then NOT output -> Alarm. If you'd like to kill any lights when the alarm goes on, you can just wire them to both Doors output's! (Or if you have a lot of lights and that becomes a pain, you could place another NOT gate off of the one we just placed, and use that so you only have to wire the lights once).  Final note: If the whole thing doesn't behave like it's supposed to and you're sure you followed this correctly, it's probably due to the placement of your liquid sensors. Sometimes, when water touches them and the floodgates open, the water level drops back down, closing them again, and causing the whole system to get stuck. Try placing the top sensors in different locations and try again, or if that doesn't help let me know as I have a fix for this problem."
starbound,3alaaf,sbLora,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:18:20 2015 UTC,Wow I already watched the video but the detailed text will definitely help me :)
starbound,3alaaf,sbLora,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"So I let some Brain fluids circle around my thinking machine and came up with the following setup and wiring  Wiring is a bit messy and I hope they will add the Delay Gate from nightly soon so I can remove the  24 Not Gates above the Chamber.  Next Problem I have right now is the Following: When I leave the Chamber into the Ocean the door will stay open, chamber flooded, and alarm ringing like hell. Would be cool if the Door either closes or the chamber gets drained."
starbound,3alaaf,somenoefromcanada38,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think you want the alarm to only sound when BOTH doors are CLOSED. Remember, you can connect more than one wire to the same input. Door 1 output -> NOT gate inpupt, Door 2 output -> same NOT gate input, NOT gate output -> alarm. That's my solution anyway.  want the chamber to drain, just hit the button on the outside (close the door behind you when you leave!)  Also, you really don't need 24 NOT Gates to create a delay. Watch the first video, and you can easily get up to 5 seconds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoh2W0kSLpw Not sure what you're using the delay for, but if it's to time the flow of water you'd be way better off using liquid sensors to shut off the mechanism and forget about timing it at all. If you need more help let me know!"
starbound,3alaaf,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:47:10 2015 UTC,because the Liquid sensor already does something when only hit by a small amount of water it opens the door. the room the opened door will let the water from the chamber drop a few levels and deactivate the liquid sensor. So without the delay it will open the door rapidly for a few times and then when the water level is high enough to actually keep the sensor under water the door will stay open. Also the delay of 24 NOT gates are just placeholder until the real delay gate is getting into stable.
starbound,3alaaf,will9900,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"If it works for you, that's great. I was just saying you don't have to use 24 NOT gates when you can use the current in-game timers. And yeah, I was afraid you'd have that problem with the liquid sensor. I've been able to solve it before by 1) placing the liquid sensor in a different spot to see if that helps, or 2) adding a delay / timed pulse to the liquid sensor (again, using current in-game timers). But if it works it works!"
starbound,3aksf1,Cross_Drive,5,Sun Jun 21 04:18:20 2015 UTC,"Captured monsters currently level up every 20 killing blows they get, maxing out at level 10. At level 10 (maybe slightly lower, I forget) the next time they level up they will evolve (change appearance).  Once they die they lose their evolved form; the next time they are summoned they will look ""normal"", and evolve again once they get 20 killing blows.  I'm not sure if The Po evolves into a Po Golem through this system, it would require testing and I have not done that yet.  If anybody would like to test it: /spawnmonster po 6 will spawn The Po at level 6.    Evolution that doesn't revert and a vastly expanded pet monster system are planned features though, they just haven't been fully implemented in the game yet."

starbound,3aksf1,Wulf_Oman,4,Sun Jun 21 15:48:11 2015 UTC,"Not really any guides yet I don't think, since the system is pretty simplistic.  It doesn't matter what level of monsters your pet kills though, so you can go to a harmless (Lush) planet and let them have at it.  Also, keep a pool of healing water nearby and drag them through it if they get hit."

starbound,3aibxy,Taylor7500,6,Sat Jun 20 13:37:44 2015 UTC,I honestly wasn't aware that there was a maximum wire length. The wires in the missions are long as hell. Thanks for the info.
starbound,3aibxy,SeaJayCJ,2,Sat Jun 20 15:14:17 2015 UTC,The wires in missions and dungeons seem to be longer than you can place yourself. I came across an Apex test chamber the other day and it had wires much longer than I could place using the wiring tool.
starbound,3aibxy,quiqksilver,3,Sat Jun 20 15:41:15 2015 UTC,If you build it in admin mode you can have unlimited wire lengths. For survival I'd recommend NOT gates to propagate the signal out.
starbound,3aibxy,quiqksilver,3,Sat Jun 20 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"I tried it in admin mode, and it still cut off after the same length. I didn't take time to measure it, but at a guess I'd say it's about 50 blocks, which really isn't that much if you're trying to keep all your gates in one room."

starbound,3aibxy,pengu213456,2,Sun Jun 21 07:35:13 2015 UTC,"What happens when the wires get ""cut off"", not sure what you're referring to, specifically. I've tested connections that were extremely far apart, and they worked fine. When running between them with the wiring tool out, the connection would seem to disappear when I got to about the middle, between them, but it would reappear when I got closer to the other one. Haven't tested with reloading worlds / restarting the game, is that when they get disconnected?"
starbound,3aibxy,SirChris314,2,Sat Jun 20 23:31:58 2015 UTC,"Essentially the wire disappears and when I try to attach it to the other end, nothing happens. I mean I am on nightly so it's possible there's a bug here, but..."
starbound,3aibxy,SirChris314,2,Sun Jun 21 00:08:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is true, but there's a good chance your wiring is being cut off due to chunks being unloaded. using a gate as a buffer still has delay since the chunk needs to be loaded before the wiring does its thing"

starbound,3ajk4a,HitmanQc,5,Sat Jun 20 20:39:53 2015 UTC,It's that two headed snake that is Early Access.  People are growing tired of putting their money towards projects that literally take years and years to release (and sometimes not at all).  Particularly if there is no clear road map nor time table to a release.  Doubly so if the game already seemed pretty well fleshed out when it hit Early Access.
starbound,3ajk4a,NonBritGit,8,Sun Jun 21 19:07:42 2015 UTC,"Lack of common stable updates/developer transparency has led to a lot of bad blood between ChuckleFish and the community. This, plus The great update drought of '14 has led a lot of people to angrily drop this game. CF suffers from the developer mistake of continually adding new unstable versions and very rarely making a stable update, (Going a month+ in between stables unlike most devs), which is a dev style a lot of people dislike.  I think until the game is completely out of beta, there's going to be a lot of turbulence. Once the official release happens, the community will come trickling back in."
starbound,3ajk4a,Gangsir,2,Sun Jun 21 02:32:08 2015 UTC,"You forgot to mention why the game stopped updating for as long as it did.  Chucklefish was coming out with frequent updates that some of the community felt were lacking in substance and frivolous, and were quick to voice their opinion. The response was for Chucklefish to basically go ""okay, we'll do a bunch of work at once and then come back with a big, stable update,"" and they went dark.  And, as the Starbound community seems wont to do, they were just as quick to dislike this style of updating as well. No matter what the devs do, the community seems to have issue with it."
starbound,3ajk4a,WhiteRhinoPSO,7,Mon Jun 22 03:09:31 2015 UTC,"The giraffe update really ruined the game for some people. Many (including me) were disappointed that they removed hunger and temperature in favor of npc combat, which is still a little boring and clunky."
starbound,3ajk4a,selrahc007,3,Sun Jun 21 00:39:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there are also plenty of people who thought that the hunger and temperature systems were boring and clunky."
starbound,3ajk4a,ScarsUnseen,7,Wed Jun 24 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"If you read the reviews, most are focused on the development process, not the actual game itself.  People are mad because it's not turning out to be the game they wanted, so they rate it negatively while ignoring the fact that the game itself is pretty wholesome even if unfinished.    My opinion is that it's well worth the 15$.  Get it.  You won't regret it.  If you ignore the rabble about the development and whatnot, you'll still enjoy the game.  The salt alone in those steam reviews put me off playing the game for well over a year because I just got so angry at the community for being so poisonous, and don't even get me started on this subreddit.  I hopped back literally just now to see the general attitude and I'm already worried that there are still storms to come."

starbound,3ajk4a,FoxFine,10,Tue Jun 23 04:00:13 2015 UTC,"Starbound is great, its in Early Access, but its still a hell of a game, and has enough content to be a full release (IMO) but the devs still want to add in more features etc. The devs used to be quite active on this sub, but I think the sheer hostility of the community has put them off, and they have been less active of late. There are a ton of mods available to download through links in the launcher, which ensures you have a reliable, safe source for mods.   I play the game on my laptop, which is fairly low end, I don't encounter any problems, aside from the fact that it takes a couple minutes to launch the game, and some occasional crashes on launch the game.  I don't know why it has been getting negative reviews, but if you are after a similar game to Terraria, but in space look no further!"
starbound,3ajk4a,Rossioo,12,Sat Jun 20 21:24:55 2015 UTC,"The bad reviews this game gets still boggle my mind. Maybe it's not the game that Chucklefish first pitched, but that's the nature of Early Access titles. I got my $15 worth long, long ago, and I don't plan on turning my back to this game any time soon.  Maybe I'm just seeing it through rose-tinted glasses, though. I know I love the game, so it's not as easy to see some of the flaws people bring up about things like combat or progression, or the remarks they make about how the game's unfinished, or that Chucklefish has abandoned it.  If the game never updated again - hell, even if it had never updated beyond Enraged Koala - I would have still been happy to pay double the current price tag for it. That may make me sound like a fanboy, but.. there are only a handful of games out there that I enjoy as much as this one."
starbound,3ajk4a,WhiteRhinoPSO,3,Sat Jun 20 22:25:30 2015 UTC,I'm sitting at 301 hrs.  This was before I stopped launching it through Steam to avoid unnecessary lag spikes.  I have payed full price for AAA titles that haven't even gotten an iota of time spent in it.  There is something undeniable satisfying about the pixel art and universe/planet mechanics.  I loathed Minecraft (only spent a weekend in it) and got bored with Terraria in about 4 hours of playing it.  ...but Starbound?  It just has something so right that holds me.

I actually started playing again recently and the amount of new content they've added is staggering. Its like a whole new game, yet completely the same in the best way possible.   Im willing to bet that most of, if not all of the ill sentiment comes from butt-hurt retards who don't realise that making a game actually takes time. At the end of the day Starbound is better supported and in a better state than 99% of the other Early Access games out there, and with such a great dev team (imo) the only way is up!"

starbound,3ajk4a,WhiteRhinoPSO,2,Sat Jun 20 23:34:16 2015 UTC,I'm the same way.

starbound,3ajk4a,Shit_Fazed,0,Sun Jun 21 02:50:03 2015 UTC,"A large majority of the people that bought the game back in 04/2013 bought it as a pre-order and not early access. In fact, Tiy made it very clear on the forums and FAQ page of the website that Starbound was not early access because he didn't want the backlash that they are now receiving. Why are they now receiving that backlash? Because they now claim Starbound is an Early Access to get around the many failed delivery deadlines. This game was announced in 02/2012 and was originally scheduled to be completed before end of 2012, then end of 2013, then end of 2014, then sometime 2015, and now... who the fuck knows (but it ain't gonna be 2015).  I bought a pre-order with a defined deadline that has been exceeded by 1 year and 6 months. I did not buy an early access, and when I attempted to get a refund, Chucklefish said they wouldn't do one. As far as I'm concerned, this was a lost cause... even if they finish the game, I likely won't even play it if Terraria: otherworld comes out before."
starbound,3ajk4a,idg3t,3,Mon Jun 22 17:30:12 2015 UTC,"When games, or anything else for that matter, is still in development, sometimes the way they're treated changes. I remember seeing the old Starbound website a long time ago myself, and at the time I mostly just shrugged and moved on - I had Terraria, which I loved, and I felt it was enough for me. It wasn't until Starbound hit Steam, and as an Early Access title (and I had seen footage of the actual game being played on Twitch), that I took a second glance and decided I liked what I saw enough to buy it. So for me, Starbound has always been an Early Access title.  I don't think Chucklefish is using the Early Access system as some kind of shield to hide unsavory practices. They have Starbound set up as one on Steam for the right reason - to let people know that the game isn't yet finished enough for a full release, and as a way to warn prospective buyers about that fact.  Given that you purchased into the game before that change came about.. I would say that you're entitled to a refund, so long as there's documentation of some sort proving you bought it during a time when it was a pre-order and not an Early Access sort of thing.  If you really want that refund, and are willing to give up the game in order to get it, then I wish you luck. I'm happy to play the game now and whenever the developers decide it's finally finished, myself."
starbound,3ajk4a,WhiteRhinoPSO,0,Mon Jun 22 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, your wishes don't carry any weight. I have been in contact with Chucklefish on several occasions regarding the matter and have been denied a refund every time. If you're happy with Early Access, I hope it all works out for you; however, I am not alone and the reason people are posting negative reviews is because they too feel betrayed about what they bought into.  I am not talking about Early access as a steam system. What I am talking about is Chucklefish's adoption of an early access mentality for development of Starbound when they were initially dead-set against it. Tiy, on their FAQ page, boldly claimed that a  2013 release was a done deal; the money would just make it happen faster. Instead, what happened was the money got invested into Chucklefish, a publishing company that was never mentioned prior to accepting pre-orders. while Starbound development stagnated, Chucklefish published 10 other titles and began making boat-loads of cash. Shortly after, they began investing into an office space, spending time and resources that were meant for starbound on hiring other developers for their 'pirate' game, etc.  You believe what you want, but Starbound is officially 1 yr 6 months behind schedule after Chucklefish made more than $4 million in pre-orders and God knows what after switching to Early Access. The sad thing is that if you truly look at the facts, the only conclusion that can be gained is that Chucklefish woefully mislead their customers. The game that was suppose to be released before the end of 2013 is just now seeing 'selling' implemented? A major feature that is required for a 1.0 release is just now being implemented 1 year and 6 months later than what the game was promised. The story line is still missing... the game is still a shell of what it was meant to be even after all this time, but that's after two major engine rewrites, 3 major combat overhauls, 2 major monster rewrites, etc.  I will bet that Starbound likely won't see a 2016 release, and if it does... it will be a shell of what was promised. Just like this alpha / beta / early access is a shell of the release that is 1yr and 6 months over due."
starbound,3ajk4a,idg3t,0,Mon Jun 22 21:30:35 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive more people have purchased it through the EA system than from pre-purchase circa EA system, so honestly, that is a very small select group to cater to, which would just be stupid.  Long story short: don't pre-order, especially if it's from an indie developer.  BONUS TIP: don't like the game?  Why stick around the reddit?  Save yourself the anguish you are obviously carrying from pre-purchasing a title you only knew of in concept."
starbound,3ajk4a,FoxFine,2,Tue Jun 23 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you that more people, now, have purchased through the EA system because it literally has been 1 year and 6 months since they switched to EA (the moment they released the beta at the end of 2013 instead of releasing the full game); however, your logic that we are a small, select group and that it would be stupid to cater to us is ridiculous. The group that you think is small and select pumped more than $4 million into their pockets. While some paid more and others less, we all paid $15 and that comes out to approx. 266,000 people. A lot more than a select group...  Long story short: don't presume to give other people your advice unless they ask.  BONUS TIP: I stick around to periodically check in on the money that I wasted because I can't get a refund; regardless of your viewpoint, I'm entitled to such; oh, and... Kiss my ass."

Making procedurally generated destructible large scale terrain optimized is actually pretty tough (even for 2d).   Just take a moment and think about each tile - it needs to store some value for its type, a reference to a texture, it's current damage state. More importantly, there is collision detection for the terrain. You can optimize that by only calculating a collision box for tiles exposed to the air.  This isn't to say that a team with 4 years of work on the game shouldn't have solved this problem, just that it's not something trivial."

starbound,3ajk4a,niqotina,2,Mon Jun 22 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"Terraria's gfx are not that detailed or varied, compared to Starbound.  Also, it doesn't handle one major universe with many many many planets populating it, so 200mb for Terraria is about right.  Less content, less space."
starbound,3ajk4a,FoxFine,6,Tue Jun 23 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"It's gotten a lot of bad reviews because it's still in early access and CK has failed to make on old promises. The game has changed quite a bit from what it was before. It's still good but it's still incomplete.   As far as running well, optimization is one of the last things CK is worried about so I wouldn't expect it to run well on a lower end PC in the dungeons and such."
starbound,3ajk4a,CrashmanX,5,Sat Jun 20 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"Optimization tends to be one of the last big sweeps in game dev as it's ill advised to optimize when you're still adding and changing systems. What you've said is correct, and what CF has stated, but I think they intend to do little fixes too as they go along and find them. I'm not sure if it's in stable but not long ago there was a tweak to improve handling of large amounts of npcs, for instance."

IIRC it's important to have a good processor moreso, the game isn't quite optimized for a wide variety of GPU's yet. If your brother is on a 64bit OS, youll be able to run the 64bit opengl build which is by far the smoothest, IMO."

I'm currently playing terraria waiting for the next stable update (terraria update coming in a few days) but I see no reason not to fully support starbound and its going to be better than terraria because of the planet exploration and colony things.

starbound,3ajk4a,Boogiewoo0,2,Sun Jun 21 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I notice the other early access game I play, KSP, seems to be constantly adding features. Maybe feature creep is why Starbound is never any closer to the finish? I'm not sure. I didn't back it as a kick starter so I'm not sure what the original scope was."
starbound,3ajk4a,WerewolfFindsDragon,5,Sun Jun 21 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"Survival games tend to draw the worst possible audience, without fail. This is an invariable truth.  The only reason you have some decent people playing Starbound is because it's also an RPG, a platformer, and it has jumping puzzles. If not for that, the community would be completely toxic. When you think back to Minecraft, Notch was forced to turn the comments off on his blog because his community was so hateful.  The problem with a survival game's community is similar to that of a bad/grindy/addictive MOBA or MMO, you'll have a huge amount of entitled people demanding more content than they ever paid for in the most dour, angry, obnoxious ways possible. Those who bought Minecraft paid $15 for it at the time (much like with Starbound), and they expected so, so much for that $15. More than anyone ever should.  They wanted a lifetime of huge, free content updates.  Why is Starbound doing badly? That toxic element expects a lifetime of huge, free content updates here, too. The game is a damned good game, and very enjoyable. But think -- why did Chucklefish remove the survival elements? They wanted to get rid of those people, they're desperate to see them gone.  They want to retool the game now as a creative builder and RPG quester. I'm fine with this. I actually prefer the game it's become. By far. It's a better game now than it ever was when it was trying to include survival guff. What they didn't count on was how petty and egotistical the survival audience is.  From all I've seen, it's almost a community of sociopaths and narcissists. It has been since Minecraft. I feel bad for anyone who misguidedly chooses to make a survival game solely because of what they aren't expecting their audience to act like.  Essentially...  1.) A survival game, or a bad/grindy/addictive MMO/MOBA. 2.) A respectful, polite, and human audience.  Pick one. You can't have both.  Eventually the backlash will die down as other people realise that Starbound is no longer a survival game and hop on board. Now that they've removed the survival elements, I've been pointing more and more people towards it. And they're also happy to hear that that's the case. No one except for the survival game/bad MMO/MOBA audience wants to be involved with them.  No one.  At all.  They are the worst of humanity barring killers and criminals.  And that's why badly written, ill conceived, misinformation-laden, FUD-filled reviews are the 'most helpful' reviews on Steam right now.Because the survival community is made up of the most pathetic people you could imagine.  It's not a reflection on the game, it's a reflection on them."
starbound,3ajk4a,WhiteRhinoPSO,3,Sun Jun 21 10:04:52 2015 UTC,"I've felt that way about parts of the community for nearly all of the survival-crafting games I enjoy. I saw exactly what you talk about with the Minecraft community first-hand, as well as what part of the Starbound and even Space Engineers communities have become.  I won't lie - I actually really miss the temperature and hunger system from the Koala-level versions of the game. I miss surviving against the harsh and unforgiving universe and still exploring every inch of it I could get my hands on. But if there's an actual chance that removing those elements might somehow trim the endless masses of entitled people who rant and rave about updates not being to their exact standards, then maybe it really is for the best.  I have a feeling that both of our comments are about to get buried in an endless sea of downvotes by the same people we're talking about, but I don't really care. I finally found someone else who sees the dark side of the survival-crafting game communities, and that kind of makes my day."
starbound,3ajk4a,Sir_Cuitry,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:16:52 2015 UTC,I haven't seen this with space engineers. My observation was that the SE community mostly loves the devs 'cause the communicate really well and make constant visible progress on the game. (Updates almost every week).
starbound,3ajk4a,WhiteRhinoPSO,2,Mon Jun 22 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"Part of the Space Engineers community put me off for a different but similarly distasteful reason.  One of the Keen Software House devs for Space Engineers, I believe Marek Rosa, mentioned on Twitter something to the effect of wanting to see how the whole ""paid mods"" thing evolved on Steam. That alone was enough to raise a veritable shitstorm from the community, most of which likely had little idea of what they were outraged about. They flocked to the game's store page on Steam in droves, giving it bad reviews - not because of the game, as every review mentioned that they still loved the game and didn't plan to stop playing it. They were writing bad reviews because of this imagined personal affront to them and other modmakers by daring to suggest that they wanted to see how things went.  Even after Marek went back on his tweet, and even after Valve got rid of the paid mods option, there were a number of reviews who still kept their Not Recommended status, despite having been edited to remark that the game was safe from the threat.  Seeing the threads on the Space Engineers subreddit where people were rallying behind the idea of shouting Keen down by smothering the game in bad reviews really put a sour taste in my mouth about the entire community for the game. The way people are acting about Starbound is quickly reaching those levels, too."

It's fun, just don't expect a completely finished product.  Also, if you do purchase SB, I highly recommend using the official Chucklefish Forums.  If you post to Steam, you will only get thread hijackers (notably the 6-7 friends I mentioned).  If you do purchase the game through Steam, I also recommend launching the game from the game's folder, not from Steam.  I suffer serious FPS drops when I load straight from Steam, but with a shortcut to the Launcher on my desktop, game runs butter smooth.  Hope to see you around more!"
starbound,3aicu9,ProxyAP,8,Sat Jun 20 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what ""big warp gates"" means, assumes it means the gate to the outpost, then right now, they are adding in more content, including challenge room, colony(they said it's kind of end game stuff), combat update and more things, also the quest dungeons are changing a bit and some scenery changing in addition.  If you haven't played it far long before ""outpost and quest"" even added, then the game changed so much and I personally think starbound now is better than a year ago, should totally give it a try. I love the progression flow right now that I even started from the beginning to the end game for about 8 times right now, and still not tired of it. Personal opinion though, but I really do think it's pretty fun and enjoyable right now."

starbound,3aicu9,Stranger371,5,Sat Jun 20 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"luck based tool upgrade mechanics   Ore generation is purely RNG-based, and mining is more boring than searching the surface of a few planets for upgrades. Could the upgrade system be better? Sure, but I consider it better already."
starbound,3aicu9,Mackinz,0,Sat Jun 20 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"Luck-based tool progression? Like they had in Terraria and Minecraft and really every other survival crafting game, where you have to find a particular material in order to build better tools?  And they're adding reasons to build bases with the addition of NPC housing. Like most other survival crafting games, a big chunk of why people play them and what they do in them is up to the player themselves.  I'm starting to think that nothing Chucklefish could say or do regarding this game would ever please even half of the Starbound community. I got my $15 worth within the first hour of gameplay back in Enraged Koala, everything since then has just been cake."
starbound,3aicu9,WhiteRhinoPSO,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"No, you need to find chests to upgrade your mining tool. Not ore or anything. It isn't even near being the same as Terraria or Minecraft. Do you even nightly?    The thing is Chucklefish has the totally wrong focus for their game. They wanted to make a building/exploration/survival game. But right now there is no survival, exploration is dull and repetitive since you know everything after four hours of playing and building...well...no reason to do so.  They spend too much time on useless stuff and not on the important stuff. The housing stuff that comes is a good move in the right direction, hell, the first one since a year.     a big chunk of why people play them and what they do in them is up to the player themselves.   Well, these people should play better games then, because Starbound does not support that part better than other games.    Edit: The 15 bucks thing is of course true. But you know why so many people, me included, are pissed? Because Starbound could have become the king of the genre. It promised so much, but they do not ""work"" towards this.  It's just wasted potential."
starbound,3aicu9,Stranger371,0,Sat Jun 20 22:45:53 2015 UTC,"No, I don't play the nightly build. If they've made the tool progression tied to finding particular items in chests on a planet, then.. I agree with your point that it seems kind of odd. And it makes me glad I made a copy of the current stable Spirited Giraffe build just like I still have an old copy of Enraged Koala.  I'm personally glad that Chucklefish has put as much time and effort into adding more decorative game assets. There's such a huge amount of things to see and experience in the universe, some of which I've still never seen despite the hundred hours I've played the game.  Your contention that people should find ""better games"" to play for when they want to build things is kind of moot. I play Starbound when I want to build things in a sort of sci-fi terrestrial setting with space exploration and a quirky atmosphere. I play Space Engineers when I want to build space ships and play at mining in space. I play Minecraft when I want to build first-person things in a somewhat older, almost medieval setting. And someday I'll play Subnautica when I feel like building in an underwater base on an alien planet.  I have some gripes with the game just like everybody else does. I miss the hunger system and the temperature system. I miss the ""random"" button on the navigation console of your ships. And above all I miss the feeling that you were surviving against the universe alone - being able to visit the Outpost at the drop of the hat makes the whole game feel far too safe, to me.  I still think that Chucklefish is working toward making Starbound the best game they can, the game they want to make. Maybe I just feel safer going along for the ride knowing I can go back and play my backup copies whenever I feel like it."

I bought it early being a huge terreria fan and load it up with friends every couple months. We get bored with it within a few hours. There is just no challenge or interesting bits for us. It feels like a grind. I really wish we could get into it but can't.
starbound,3aicu9,WhiteRhinoPSO,5,Sat Jun 20 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"I personally had more of a sense of wonder back before the Outpost was introduced. The universe felt a lot more dangerous, and my character felt a lot more alone, like they were really fending for themselves.  At least the trips to and from the Outpost aren't as tiresome now that you can bookmark the 2-Stop Teleshop pad. Still, the sense that there's a safe haven literally seconds away from any trouble I might get into does take a lot of the immersive danger away."
starbound,3aicu9,giltirn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"I think the missions and the combat update might solve that issue.

Unfortunately many people buy into a game and immediately expect it to be complete and bug free, whereas in reality it will likely take years. These development setbacks I expect are very common even in big studios, you just don't hear about them because they are tend to keep development quiet until the game approaches its complete form."

Personally I am disappointed when I bought the game I was fooled into thinking it would be an awesome space adventure with rad suits and spaceships but now what we have is a terrible not space adventure with swords and a terrible progression system with dull mining.   Part of the problem is the graphics are terrible and I don't mean the pixelated style everything is just a bit to big for the chosen resolution and you can't change the res of stuff thus resulting in giant spoons and daggers the size of short swords.

If that's possible without overhauling the entire look right now. It's not a bad look, but it does get sort of jarring when Cuddles McMuffin the Eldritch Adoration is trying to gnaw your bollocks off.   Unfortunately I'm not entirely sure how to go about this, because I'm not entirely sure what causes the look specifically. The actual shapes? The colour palette? Couldn't say. But it would be nice to run across some more creepy or jarring stuff in there. But only if it's not going to break the whole current aesthetic."
starbound,3aevie,Industrialbonecraft,31,Sat Jun 20 08:29:06 2015 UTC,"A couple things come to mind:   Alternate ship paint jobs, perhaps discovered or for sale from merchants. More hair styles.  I know there are mods for this, but I don't see any reason that there can't also be more by default. Is it possible right now to give the armor sets custom colors?  Because that would be really cool.  Also, more armor and clothing is always nice, although I don't find Starbound to be at all deficient in terms of clothing variety. Not sure if the engine supports this, but animated and/or light emitting building tiles might be cool. Someone else mentioned more monster variety, which would be nice, although I think monster behavior variety is more important right now.   By and large, though, I think a lot of what Starbound needs right now is the stuff that's currently in the pipeline to be addressed by the devs.  Starbound already strikes me as having an impressive amount of art."

I'm not going to directly link to all of them so the bot isn't posting 10+ tweets, but you can read them on twitter here if you want.  He hasn't directly answered any from this thread yet, but I let him know it's here and has a lot of feedback.  Everything in quotes is a direct quote, the others are paraphrased.    Q: Space dragons please. A: Not impossible to do, but neither planned nor ruled out.    Q: Be able to buy blocks/materials. A: Maybe, there is a lot to consider. Will probably look at it as we readdress all the other economy stuff.    Q: Weapon and Armor racks (displays). A: They have a high chance of being put in the game, especially Armor racks. No promises though.    Q: Some of the wooden furniture could use some work. A: That's mostly older assets. I recently touched up several, you may see new looks in the Nightly.    Q: Ability to customize the outside of our ships, even just the colors. A: We can technically do stuff like this already, at least with the colors. But it isn't a priority for being put in the game. I'd love to do it someday though.    Q: More Hylotl furniture. A: There's a surprising amount already done but not found ingame yet. We'll be making more when we get to their cities though.    Q: Weather in the background. A: That is something we've been exploring.    Q: Diagonal half blocks. A: I'm not sure we're headed in that direction right now.    Q: More ships to choose from. A: We could potentially go crazy on ships one day, but if we did it would be after 1.0.    Q: More monster parts or more unique monsters. A: ""There might be something on the horizon for monsters (eventually, and might)... We've been thinking about them.""    Q: More parallaxes besides forest. A: We're going through parallaxes one by one, Desert is next. All of them will be addressed.    Q: Including underwater parallaxes? A: ""I'd love to work on parallaxes for a long time. They can only get better. It's an issue of how much time we want to spend.""      Edit - More answers from Saturday morning:    Q: ""more biome specific monsters! Like deer or elk in the garden! Or sharks or whales in the ocean!"" A: ""We want to do this too. All in time hopefully.""    Q: ""Different colours for Water and Magma. I just think it'd be cool to have Red Oceans, and like Neon Green magma."" A: ""We like to have players immediately know what liquid they're looking at for gameplay. While we might have some alt colors, the alts will probably be fairly limited in order to keep it easy to read. Also want to preserve unique experiences per liquid.""    Q: Human stuff is out of place / old A: ""Humans will likely later get a good makeover as they're one of the races lacking a bit in assets.""    Q: The Matter Manipulator doesn't have any impact, doesn't look like you're doing anything. A: ""I've never considered that. I might bring up potentially giving it more ""feedback"" of some sort to make it feel more satisfying.""    Q: Monsters that roam in the background, perhaps the big ones before you fight them. A: ""With the parallax layers that might be awkward. We've still considered having monsters in the background and will consider it more.""    Q: More consistent viewing angles on furniture. A: ""I agree. This is one of those low priority things though. I hope we find time to make it a bit more consistent. One day!""    Q: Glowing effects on ores. A: ""We'd use glowing ores sparingly. We can make them but they tend to take away a bit from discovery since they're so obvious.""    Q: ""Being able to see nebulae, pulsars, asteroid belts, and other space phenomena in the night sky would be sweet."" A: ""I would like this too. :)""    Q: ""Can I say mechanics, gameplay, and new content? Cause those need polishing more than sprites."" A: ""You can say anything you want but I only do art and implement some stuff in the game on a non-coder level. Not my skillset.""    Q: ""I would also REALLY like to see more in the way of armored long-coat outfits in the vanity armor sets. Gas masks, too."" A: ""We might see more. I want to readdress/add a lot of armors. But it's literally the most tedious work in Starbound.""    Q: Poptops! A: ""Poptops will make it in. No worries."""

starbound,3aevie,duckmurderer,4,Fri Jun 19 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"Right now all previous suggestions here are valid and needed. Especially the desire for more body parts for random monsters and recurring unique monsters, those perhaps even tied to specific races, is high!  Yet I myself would like to finally see something done about the dire lack of furniture and general items for the Novakid!  But here's my plea for that: Don't make their stuff TOO obviously western-themed!  Spruce it up and infuse a good mix of diesel-and-revolver-punk!  Nuts and bolts aplenty, lots of pipes and gauges and a nice little rusty nuclear reactor just for kicks. Have their houses be reminiscent of classic western town styles, with saloons, a sheriff's office, general goods and weapons dealers, yet different enough to pass as something a living star with ADD would put together just to make it work.  Then something else: Alien farm animals (fig1. )! Think of how we humans treat the most productive breeds and extrapolate into a vast universe, where specific creature types would propagate maybe even beyond cultural borders. Maybe each race would have one or two specimen to contribute for recognition value's sake?  We already got mecha-chickens but even those aren't as alien as could be.  And I would strongly corroborate all wishes for more unique armour, which does not neccessarily have to be craftable. Maybe such as rare drops from unique monsters?  And last but not least: More shield types! Definitely! I'm at this point so. very. tired. of seeing all the same shields everywhere. The roman style ""scutum"" is the worst offender... Man, I even studied archeology for quite some time and should love it, but it feels so out of place in Starbound. So please, more shields!   Best regards and a big thank you to all of the dev team for all your efforts and almost 900 hours of fun! :-D  Edit: Added picture for inspiration"
starbound,3aevie,Pathosphere,4,Fri Jun 19 18:20:49 2015 UTC,I don't really care about what they specifically do with the art. I'd just like to see them go all out with the pixel art. Get that old school cool.

starbound,3aevie,Katzeus,8,Sat Jun 20 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"Seems like they're already working on it, but more fleshed out biome backgrounds. The forest one they've been showing off looks great, I'd love for the rest of the game to be the same.  Another thing I'd like to see is (lots) more pre-made monsters.

Like radioactive looking thunderstorms and flashes of creatures in the night. Maybe random glowing eyes in the dark. It would make planets more interesting to be certain.   One thing most other people have suggested is having the image of other ships or station be in the background of planets while inside a ship. This would add tons to world building if on say a tentacle planet we saw a crushed colony ship in the background. Or for colonies there could be powered down ships. And for traders junky looking heaps hanging around. This would also get people interested in exploring planets. Because if I see a wrecked ship, I would definantly beam down to see if anyone's down there.  Finally, normal weather is... boring. The worlds need to feel more alive. Maybe there could be random little swirls representing gusts of wind. Or clouds that could produce dim shadows. There's alot of possible ideas, but just a tiny amount of animation can go a long way."
starbound,3aevie,Pathosphere,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:00:31 2015 UTC,You gave me an idea on weather- when you view planets on the navigator it would be a really nice little touch if it had some procedurally generated cloud formations swirling about. Maybe the clouds on gas giants could swirl about as well! Speaking of gas giants...  It would be really cool to explore a gas giant in a hoverbike or research pod. Just sayin'.
starbound,3aevie,Bellofortis,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:05:17 2015 UTC,Gas giants have a very dense core surrounded by lots and lots of gas.  You would not survive the trip to the surface of the core.

I mean, we have magic staves, nanosuits and already go to the core of solid planets (since when do people survive that irl?). For a slight tweak in the suspension of disbelief you'd get a really interesting biome (solid gases anyone?)  that to my knowledge no game has really explored previously.

starbound,3aevie,HobbitFoot,2,Sun Jun 21 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"I'd actually prefer monsters be drawn from scratch, or have an improved generator to make monsters look more specific to their biome.   I'm an on off player, I'm sure that's not uncommon to hear, I have a few gripes with this game but I'm glad that it is improving, albeit slowly. So I'll say keep up the good work, and that I'm glad you guys are being open about development in this way. I'm not sure if you read the Reddit posts but thanks anyway.  One thing that turns me off from exploring is that I see the same looking monsters on every biome. I've never much liked the monster generator and was a big fan of Terrarias hand picked monsters, they gave the game more character. When I first heard SB would have generated monsters I was excited because I thought the game would always give me something new. However, this was not the end result. Instead, the game throws the same groups of minions at me again and again with only a colour change in difference.   What I do like is the hand drawn minions like the robots, droids, the sewer monsters, and all of the mission monsters. These are the monsters that I'll remember because of their character and specific abilities. Let's face it, the generator we currently have does not do the job of creating monsters with  the same amount character as the designed ones, infact they are pretty forgettable. Instead of giving the world more variety it only makes it more bland.  When I last left SB there wasn't much cause to explore the same biome more than once. When I did see the hand drawn monsters I felt much more excited than seeing another computer generated one. My proposal firstly, would be to create about 5-10 hand drawn monsters for every biome, and sprinkle them throughout the worlds. Secondly, each specific biome should have parts that the generator can only use for that biome: Snow biome would have creatures with thick fur and fat; Desert would have more scaled monsters and vulture like birds; The nicer, forested areas would have small mammal like creatures; Jungles could have creatures similar to spiders, frogs and bats. I think you get where I'm going with this.  Generally, I want more consistency in the monsters. I want them to be more famliar to the biome they live in, and not look like they were made by a robot.  Another point I would make would be able animation, but that might not be specific to the art team.  I would ask that character and monster animation look less robotic, if possible."

A lot of it looks really good, but there's a handful of things that stand out as being graphically outdated. The biggest issue, in my opinion, is that a lot of the furniture is seen ""straight on"" and a lot shows one side.  I feel like they need to commit to one version.  I would also like the sizes to use even block measurements. Right now, things can be basically any size, and it makes it hard to center or line up a lot of things. For example, in the ships, the hatches between floors are 5 tiles wide... it makes placing furniture around them difficult. Also in one ship, the  locker is 4 tiles wide, the AI Interface is 3 wide, and it looks off balance. I know changing this would be hard at this point... But in a perfect world.   I think there's a lot of redundant tiles too; my inventory will fill up with dirt and cobblestone of different types and I often can't tell which is which from the thumbnails.

starbound,3aevie,Xavion_Zenovka,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:31:51 2015 UTC,"If I could add some suggestion about to add to this already great work (if its not too late).  My main concern is about sci-fiction stuff, starbound is acually the only game I found moddable, procedurally generated, that propose to wander across the universe aboard a ship with a great variety of dungeons and environments. I would just add more environnments, specificly about the star topic. To make it more realistic, most of the star of the galaxy are systems of with tow or three different star class orbiting. I would also love to see things like a planet devasted and lost in a supernova's nebula, orbiting around a slow neutron star emitting at regular intervals, some radiation flashs afecting regurlarly the surface of the planets. Of course I would love to see an interstellar like black holes and planets similar to the film (just waves on oceans planets, I dont know if the phisic of liquids woud allow it). And also, I Have got tons of planets idears; some hollow at the center, dyson spheres left from ancient civilisations, truly aliens worlds with enormous trees, strange rock formations, or things comparables to some satellites of our solar system like sulphur/phosphore planets with volcanoes. Satellites differenciated like triton, europe (and its iceshelf and ice geysers), or simply planets with much more atmospheric opacity, fog etc...like titan. Simply folliage of the trees and grass matching with the spectral type of the star etc... Volcanic planets with real dversity of eruptions, impact on the environment (maybe a better lava) And of course, I would love to see more variations to gas planets (blue, green one, hot pegasides for burning stars etc...), with a way to visit a bit their athmosphere, or at leat their asteroid and ice rings (I would love to see rings around planets instead of asteroid fields).  Also nebulas etc...toxic waste planets, space discharge where ships are scrapped and pieces sold away to embetter or change the ship design, minefields, alien fleets, or just of your faction where you can buy weaponry, mercenary contracts for colonies (to see how bigger ship, destroyer or carriers like ships would look like)...or just make your own orbiting fleet. City planets, extremly rare but matching every race society (homeworlds of each races in fact), comparable to trantor, coruscant etc (but proceduraly generated otherwise it would take years to design ). Space mines, similar to the first mission but that we could fin on planets as shielded dungeon for this stuff etc.. Make some random encounter in solar systems (placed like planets are) objets like comets where to find usefull materials, big geocruiser asteroids, artificial satellite; lost ships we could salvage, sapce wreckage, lost space station, lone artificial planetoid, traces of this ancient civilisation elsewhere tahn just the gateways in every system (If it wouldnt break the game, I would not make a gateway in every system) etc... I also would like to see less life around, just to make it more realistic and allow life only in a certain portion of every solar systems.  Regarding ships, I would also like to see some more equipments for navigations like screens, a warp core we can interract with (or simply some warp nacelles instead of just thrusters) etc... Some mods already introduce some functionnality, but some of these would be awesome if introduced in the base game (like modular ship construction etc...). A way to choose between beaming down to the planete or take your personnal shuttle, craft from your hangar to go down to the planet after an animation or loading screen etc... I would love to have a real 0 G space, no gravity in sateroid field (and no life there, please, excpets worms, space whales or equivalents, but not athmospheric birds). Just look at all science fiction series of book, or comics, there are so many idears to be considered to devellop starbound, in expansions maybe (I know the studio is quite small) And I'm not even out of ideas... This game have and incredible potential, and i'm sometime quite annoyed that its turning more in a fantasy game than a sci-fi one (swords, why not...but vibrosword/plasma saber are much better from my point of view).

starbound,3afh02,Bellofortis,3,Fri Jun 19 20:01:09 2015 UTC,"I hope the survival mechanics come back in a deeper form, which seems to be hinted at by the devs as being the case. I personally would like to see variable hazards based on what is actually happening around your character, while the tech suits mitigate the negative effects.  For instance hanging out next to a lava pool ticks up towards a threshold to where you start taking damage. Certain materials could emit heat/cold/radiation in the world. If you have the heat suit the speed at which you start feeling the heat is diminished. Similarly effects could be made for desert/arid planets going through a heat wave on the surface, wandering too close to a thermal vent or mayhaps there could even be an event where you have to rebuild a melting down reactor core using blocks in the right placement, meanwhile racing the timer of your nano shield being overrun with heat and radiation.  The underlying issue Im trying to address here is that despite planetary exploration being a primary draw of the game, planets themselves currently feel in no way antagonizing. I feel that the vast majority of challenges the players face come in the terms of the mission mobs and bosses whereas exploring the planet is more akin to a time sink keeping you from getting to the next tier. There should be a reason that civilization hasn't reached these particular stars yet: their climates are largely inhospitable to the very idea short of conquering or coexisting with it.  Anyways TLDR. I think I should be more afraid at the friggin core of the planet than frollicking with the local wildlife penis head quadropeds on the surface. The current ""put harder monsters deeper!"" Isn't an elegant or comprehensive enough solution in my eyes. I hope I didn't come off negative! Im actually still rather happy with the game's direction, it's just beta."

starbound,3abhwh,amshegarh,3,Thu Jun 18 22:12:49 2015 UTC,No. The parallax is determined on world gen. That would be unrealistically complex for so little payoff

Off the top of my head they probably don't have a way to load the backgrounds on the fly.  They may not even have a file where backgrounds are stored.  It's possible it's just generated from the seed every time the world loads.

starbound,3abhwh,jambox5,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:06:13 2015 UTC,"Humans is just dumb computers yo.  I guess I should have said that I have a straightforward enough model in my head, but I don't know enough about Starbound to know if such a model is prohibitely difficult to implement given whatever limitations the code imposes. It's just a matter of having the foreground produce a signal that carries enough information for whatever produces the parallax to assemble it out of the right parts. I guess the genuinely tricky bit is having realistic ecotones that depict the spread of a given biome, since I see that probably needing a relatively complex signal and complex procedures for generating interactions between the species of flora.  I should also clarify and say I'm not trying to say I'm right. I acknowledge my ignorance here. I'd genuinely like for you to expand on why you think dynamically generated parallaxes would be too complex. (I disagree there would be too little payoff, personally I think it would be fucking sweet to plant an eyeball tree and watch the parallax update bit by bit as the eyeballs outcompete the native flora, or something. A full-fledged horticulture system where I could breed for various traits... oh man. One can dream.)"
starbound,3abhwh,bluedesertgondola,3,Fri Jun 19 12:15:40 2015 UTC,"humans are needlessly complicated compared to computers and work on an entirely different set of rules. you can sort of ""emulate"" in your mind how a computer would work but they are not the same and a lot of the time the emulation is doing something completely different that just looks like how a computer would work. i just don't want anyone to get these confused.  that being said it wouldn't be that difficult to create parallax based on the trees around it but it likely wouldn't look as good. plus you can't change the biome, so it would make no sense to change out the background based on that."

Hence, Selling something as what the populace calls ""cute"" appeals to both sexes. What you might be thinking of as cute, large eyes, fluffy characters or whatever, is not specific to women. Women are not more attracted to colours or whatever than men are, this is a statistical fact. Both genders find kittens and puppies cute, this cannot be denied.  For example, did you know the colour pink, a ""feminine"" colour, was not associated with females AT ALL (it was mostly associated with men due to red being war-like) until about the 1940s, when marketing created the idea of ""gender signified"" themes in order to sell their products. The actual themes themselves make no sense and are completely unrelated to the groups."
starbound,3ad2kq,Mackinz,-2,Mon Jun 22 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"You're making the predictable kneejerk mistake of thinking that because something's marketed to men/women, it means ALL men/women are supposed to like it. Every time one of you people do this it makes me yawn.   Yes, my wife reflects the attitude and opinion of an entire group, because she's a typical example of that group. That is very different from saying that she reflects the attitudes and opinions of every single member of that group. She likes cute phone games, serial cop shows about feisty female cops, and women's magazines with pictures of babies and weddings. Does that mean that all women like these things? No. Does it mean that a statistically significant amount of women like these things? Absolutely - otherwise there would be no such thing as media that was aimed at specific audiences.   You people need to put down the political correctness kool-aid and realize that demographics actually exist, and people's preferences can be reasonably predicted based on what demographic they belong to. Jesus Christ, all I said was that Starbound was leaning towards marketing itself to women, and I get a bunch of kids jumping down my throat calling me gross and sexist. For Christs sake, get off your soapboxes and come back to reality."

As has been confirmed several times before by the devs, and several users pointing back to the dev confirmations, these mechanics will be introduced after an overhaul that actually makes them a challenge and not as bad as they were during the Koalas.  And yes, they were bad. Attached to your character? How do you get attached to your character by being forced to click the mouse after you start hearing beeping? ""Proper gear"" was always tiered armor (definitely not the near-impossible-to-craft Snow Infantry set), as it is now... seriously, I will never understand people who romanticize those systems. Sure, I'd like to see improved versions of them implemented, but they were not good or fun systems as they were in the Koalas."

starbound,3adb2u,silverevilchao,3,Fri Jun 19 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"Watering crops is in the Nightly branch of Unstable, and works very simply: point a Wooden Watering Can within a direction and fire at dry tilled soil. It's a gun that fires water. As best I can tell, the effect of watering is permanent until you destroy the watered tilled soil, so once unless if you make a mistake with a hoe or may mining tool.  The watering can has a limited range and is rather annoying to use to water a lot of tilled soil. You have to click it multiple times to cover a lot of ground, though you can seem to fire through ceilings if they are low enough so that speeds it up a bit.  Chucklefish should add a fire hose gun with a better range as an upgrade to the watering can."

starbound,3a93tx,BlaK_HawK,6,Thu Jun 18 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"I actually fully agree with this. Most ships, fully upgraded, end up looking like a pyramid and they are sometimes even a chore to navigate. The Novakid ship, though thematically nice, is really really ugly to the point I never play Novakid because of that ugly ass ship. The exception, the Hylotl ship, is the design I like the best. Even though it has less usable space than the other ships its compact design and nice room layout actually let's you fill it up better and more efficiently. I'd like to see more ship designs in the future and be able to choose what you like since different people have different preferences."
starbound,3a93tx,Nidmorr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:54:08 2015 UTC,What I like most about rethemed layouts for other races is that it's an easy retexturing and therefore a realistic suggestion.

I just love the look of it and its theme. Space train!  The other ships I like all the way through to their final form are the Hylotl and Floran ships. The Avian and Glitch ships are all right, and fit with their theme of pyramids and castles.  But there are two ships whose final forms I dislike so much that I've never played the races after the Winter Update hit: Humans and Apex. The Human ship has a very large cockpit area compared to the relatively tiny hallway leading into the rear of the ship. And the Apex ship.. that's just a diamond floating in space with as many guns on the hull as they could fit, with otherwise nearly no aesthetic quality of its own. It may work for easy of movement when trying to get to a part of your ship, but I think it looks terrible.  I still wish that progression through quests and the universe itself wasn't intrinsically tied into ship upgrades. I want to be able to fly around the universe and explore while using my dinky little one-room ship if I so choose - I do like how the Human and Apex ships look when they're starting out, at least!"

The way I do it is usually equip the teleport, double jump and dash techs and explore the surface of a planet quickly in search of these things. Also remember that if you find one structure you can stop searching the rest of the planet as each planet only holds 1 major village/dungeon.  For the items your are looking for, I would recommend looking on risky and above planets as they can hold both the items you are currently looking for but also items required for future quests. Alien planets are generally the easiest to explore quickly as they don not have as much random damage and are also easier to mine if you want to go underground."

starbound,3a65g8,Nidmorr,5,Wed Jun 17 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"What, really? All of the unbreakable NPC villages or dungeons have one of those shield generator things? Let me go check..  EDIT: Oh, hey, there it is. That's actually pretty neat! Thank you for your help, Nidmorr."
starbound,3a65g8,Nidmorr,3,Wed Jun 17 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"Happy to help.  Some locations do, some don't. In fact I think only the Apex Apartment blocks, USMC Prison, Apex Trap course and maaaaybe Glitch Village have them. Most other locations are yours to pillage as you see fit."
starbound,3a65g8,uselessdragonfly,2,Wed Jun 17 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"On the character I used to test this, which was my most advanced character at having just beaten the Erchius Mining Facility mission, I realized that I had a big medieval-style furnace I had stolen from a Glitch village.. which I thought was strange, if the other cities were protected.  This was also on my vopy of the game that I hadn't let be updated, so I had initially thought I had made the copy before the ""can't break block"" things had been added."
starbound,3a65g8,mrbibs350,5,Wed Jun 17 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"From the wiki: Some dungeons, such as Apex Test Chambers and USCM Prisons, have a shield generator inside them that protects all blocks within dungeon boundaries from being mined. The shield generator can be toggled on and off by interacting with it. When a shield generator is mined all it drops is a circuit board. The shield generator is usually in the middle of the dungeon or village on the top of the building. This forces the players to go through the dungeon as designed instead of mining it immediately."
starbound,3a10t3,BradleyBuyer,52,Tue Jun 16 11:32:28 2015 UTC,"The major problem of Starbound's ""feature creep"" occurred when devs decided to throw out the previous survival mechanics along with ""primitive"" tools without giving a sane substitute nor redesigning the established engine's mechanics.  First, regarding the tools. Drills and pickaxes are no longer worth the inventory space they take up, and their lifespan is so short you actually question why they were left in the game at all. Nerfed beyond usability, they screwed up the way exploration works - more time grinding away at a pixel and less time moving through (Matter Manipulator is incomparable with the Koala's Platinum Drill, even after the complete upgrade). The result is much more of a time-filler chore and less underground secrets to be discovered. Stone hoes were common sense that Chucklefish also threw away. Basic agriculture should not require delving in the early game to scrape up copper, but with the stone hoe as an option you could start tilling the soil within moments of creating your first workbench. Not anymore.  When people saying the survival mechanics has no purpose nor balance, I can't help but wonder if they have any freakin' imagination at all. Because they don't understand how ridiculously wrong they are:   temperature mechanics were actually balanced and even included the daily and weather-based changes! At the first game stages, you had to actually take all this into account and prepare yourself a shelter, or you'd find yourself either dead or back at your ship, cloned. You could also survive a cold winter night if either would be lucky to find a decent protective armour or dug deep down underground where the temperature is higher thanks to planetary core's warmth. lack of breathable atmosphere on the surface also didn't meant you can't find one underground. And technically, it's actually possible even in our very own universe. The way you could dig fast enough thru the surface to get to the breathable air under the ""lifeless"" moon's surface without any protective gear and barely survive... Felt good, man. even though hunger itself indeed was an ""deadly egg timer"", it added yet another game aspect - verisimilitude. Yes, just a single variable with a timer change has drastically twisted the relationship between the player and his avatar.   Yes, all these felt good, because they were aspects of roleplaying, the ""realistic"" roleplaying in the universe where everything is possible if you'll try hard enough! Psychologically, it's way easier to associate yourself with a bunch of pixels who can also die of hunger, freeze, overheat and suffocate, but also have a chance to overcome everything of above. Instead, we've got a bunch of immortal pixels who only use food as a power-up and don't afraid of anything except other three ""deadly egg timers"": Biome Radiation, Biome Heat and Biome Cold, which are not really timers but a bunch of global boolean variables which can either be turned ""on"" or ""off"" with ""nanoskin"".  About the biomes themselves: several nicely designed biomes, like Flesh, Heck and others were cut out of the game because they either were ""unrealistic"" or ""copied others to some degree"". The point is nobody likes the strict ""realism"". These locations spiced up the gameplay and were actually fun to discover.  Concerning the ""near empty planets"", there are two or three variables in the game scripts which need to be altered to give more life to the planet surface. For example, right now the one that corresponds for the dungeon generation is set to range from 0 to 1, which is extremely little (again, just like broken tools, this forces player to ""discover"" other planets in hope for anything valuable or unique to spawn on them, thus stretching the boredom even further).  People must be allowed to play the way they want if the mechanics itself makes it possible. But what do we see now? Get off the rails and prepare to be punched straight in your face ""because you're breaking our divine creative vision"". I'll probably sound like a broken record now (because I said it countless times ever since I've joined this community), but punishing your players and artificially making the game to last ""longer"" never makes them happy.  I hope someday devs will change their mind, because you do know it's very easy to please everyone - do not cut out features, but make them optional. The more options, the better the game will be."

starbound,3a10t3,Darkpursuer,2,Wed Jun 17 07:37:20 2015 UTC,"I only disagree with two things here(I play in nightly btw.). I find that pickaxes(while nearly worthless to make) are still very useful to find in the early game. They allow me to mine in a larger area than my MM can do. It takes a decently long time to actually upgrade the MM now that you need MM modules. Pickaxes provide the area and drills are way stronger than the MM.  In total, they aren't worthless, they've just been nerfed into early game items.  ( I went back to look for my second qualm and couldn't find it. So I'll just leave it at the pickaxes aren't useless. They are just early game items now.)"

But yeah, the biomes, and monsters are still a mess.  the teleporters are finally making the planet hoping better.. but even that seems like a patch on a broken system. Many of the core RNG based progressive generation was never resolved into good gameplay."
starbound,3a10t3,MBirkhofer,54,Tue Jun 16 13:28:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting, what in your opinion do you think we could be doing better? Keeping in mind that we can't work any faster, and you acknowledge that progress is being made.   Right now we have two huge updates in the pipeline that are being developed simultaneously. Some of these are cosmetic changes, but these also include changes and additions that will improve the game dramatically. There are a few weak areas that definitely need addressing, and we know where we can make huge improvements. But the reality of the situation is that we have to choose which of these areas to focus on at any given time, as it's just not possible to tackle everything at once."
starbound,3a10t3,Supernorn,24,Tue Jun 16 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"I'm torn.  On the one hand, I know (or believe) that many of the recent additions are pretty stubby — the quests seem like playable placeholders, the combat is in constant flux, the endgame planets are clearly unfinished.  I'm no stranger to software development, so seeing this from an alpha is not a huge surprise.  :)  On the other hand, in practice, I end up playing Starbound for a week or two after every stable update...  and then I run out of stuff to do, get bored, and drift off until the next one.  Maybe that's okay, though.  I don't want to tell you how to make your game in gritty detail; then it wouldn't be your game.  But here are the structural improvements I find myself wishing for, based on the current state of the game.   Strong reliance on novel interactions.  I think this is ultimately the only way to make a large procgen world full of stuff be fun for a long time.  It's certainly what drew me to roguelikes initially.  Right now there are a lot of very fixed hurdles to jump over: upgrade your MM with 10 uranium, give me a roll of string, etc.  In a game with a zillion items (and surely far more by the time we're done), it doesn't make a lot of sense that there would be so many problems that can only be solved with one particular object.    Likewise, it doesn't make sense that so many objects can only be crafted one way with a single fixed set of ingredients.  Why do I need a gold bar, not a gold block?  They're both solid gold.  Why can't I melt down a gold pickaxe?  Surely what's important is that the inputs have X gold among them, not that the gold is literally in the form of a bar.  It would be really interesting if the basic crafting were more about properties of reagents, not so much checking off items on a checklist.  There are so many possible randomly-generated weapons in the world, yet I can only craft a fixed set of ten or so.  What if I find a gun that looks really cool, but is considerably weaker than what I can craft?  Why can't I reuse its parts?  Why can't I upgrade it?  In a similar vein: Everything should be useful.  The premise is ultimately about scrounging and making do with what I can find, but in practice, I really just want a dozen kinds of basic resource throughout the entire game.  Dirt and rock are only useful as decoration (if that); most of the objects found in dungeons are likewise only decorative.  Decorations are great, of course, but I can't do anything with them — I can't transform them in any way, and I can't even break them down into component pieces (once I've hit the point that I have ten stacks of every item in the game).  A large part of the game feels like I'm just handed some trinkets, and I can either like them or put them in a ship locker to gather dust.  There's not really any improvisation to be done with stuff that isn't useful in its base state.  The monsters and weapons and planets and biomes are all different every time, yet the stuff I can actually make or use is always exactly identical.  It sounds like the NPC village building mechanic is making strides in this direction, which is great!  I just hope it doesn't stop there  :) The RNG is too random.  It has no problem putting eight of those damned outposts all right next to each other, or constructing every sewer to look pretty much the same.  I was a little disappointed to see that dungeon overlap was ""solved"" by just limiting planets to no more than one dungeon, rather than forcing them to have enough space.  There needs to be some defense against this.  Don't roll the same microdungeon right next to another copy of it; chop dungeon parts into smaller pieces so there's a little more variety (even just varying platforms or the sizes of rooms would help).  When the whole game is randomly generated, you've gotta go well out of your way to avoid even the faintest whiff of what might be a set piece, or the illusion is ruined.   I doubt this is anything you haven't thought about before, but as long as everyone's giving their 2¢...  :)"
starbound,3a10t3,lexyeevee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:49:52 2015 UTC,Your comments about crafting makes me think of fallout 4.
starbound,3a10t3,Tripanes,29,Thu Jun 18 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"Just to throw in my two cents, one of the biggest things that inspires me to play Minecraft is that there are numerous things that you need to progress that all take up a lot of space. The space requirement prompts me to build large structures for housing each of these things. What's more, they all tend to complement the core objective of growing more powerful.  I don't know how many people share my opinions, but there is very little inspiring me to build anything beyond a shack with a door housing my stuff. All of the tools/features are easy to stack on top of each other or even just keep on the ship, and the things that aren't (like farming) don't greatly contribute to my progress through the game.  It might be a bit late in development to address these kinds of concerns, but I think you ought to figure out ways in which all of your disparate features can contribute more directly to the strength and well-being of the player character."
starbound,3a10t3,Socrathustra,7,Tue Jun 16 21:24:59 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of multiple progression paths. I think what you've described is great for the stated ""combat/adventuring"" path. Personally I'm hoping for an ""economic/executive"" path, like in X3. Part of the fun of sandboxes for me is increasing the scope of my agency by building resources to recruit more agents to my cause."
starbound,3a10t3,bluedesertgondola,-3,Wed Jun 17 00:08:51 2015 UTC,"Just to throw in my two cents, one of the biggest things that inspires me to play Minecraft is that there are numerous things that you need to progress that all take up a lot of space.   Uuh... what Minecraft are you playing? You can do everything in the game from a modest size hole in the ground. The only time I've ever build big was because I was bored with tons of blocks.  Starbound is basically the same, however, but at least it has far more blocks for almost every kind of themed structure you could want, and decorations to boot."
starbound,3a10t3,lazarus78,26,Tue Jun 16 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"So you can do a lot from a crafting table, but if you want to enchant your armor, you need an enchanting table. If you want the table to be powerful, you need bookshelves. If you want bookshelves, you need cows. If you want cows, you need wheat. Just in that short little chain of dependencies, you need two farms (cows, wheat) and an enchantment room. Those take a good deal of space. The additional dependencies for things like potion-making and such extend a good deal further.  Starbound has no such dependency chains nor any real motivating factor for farming whatsoever. The only thing that matters is getting enough ore to progress to the next tier. As such, you just land on a planet and start digging. Either throw away or stash most everything you find and move on."
starbound,3a10t3,Socrathustra,6,Wed Jun 17 00:50:58 2015 UTC,"Enchanting only needs a 5x5x3 space. 1 crafting table, 1 furnace, 1 brew stand, 1 anvil, hand full of chests, and you can do basically anything in the game.  Yeah a lot of things in starbound are useless, but Minecraft isn't a saint either. Starbound actually has furniture and hundreds of decorative objects. Minecraft has... basically none. You have to use stairs with signs on the sides for a chair you cant even sit in. There is no reason in minecraft to build anything other then a box you occasionally expand for more storage. You progress from wood to stone in like 2 minutes. 10 more minutes for iron, and within a few hours, youve obtained diamonds. Congrats, you've reached the end of the tool train. You go from the overwolrd to underground, to the nether, to the end, and then you are done, you've done all there is to do worth while in minecraft. All you have left is build a pixel dickbutt or something.  Both games are not perfect in all aspects. Starbound has an obvious focus on customization and decoration, which will soon come into play more with colonies. Minecraft is quite stagnant with any sort of progression. (Vanilla wise)"
starbound,3a10t3,lazarus78,2,Wed Jun 17 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"So you can just do things in a pretty small area, but to do them well, you need a lot more room. I automate most of my farms so that I don't have to screw with them nearly as much. Also, while you might think of the lack of furniture as a limitation, it actually affords a great deal of creative gameplay. In Starbound, if you want a chair, your decorations are static, though numerous. In Minecraft, there are a number of different ways to make decorations, and you can vary how you manage your own house according to your own creativity rather than the creativity of the artists who designed the sprites."
starbound,3a10t3,Socrathustra,3,Wed Jun 17 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"Ive played minecraft since alpha. It is a very shallow game on its own without any mods.  The player to block size ration means you basically have to build big to get most details. You can do some things on smaller scales, but it is extremely limited. A fence post with a pressure plate on top, or an extended piston are your only options for a table. Stair block is your only option for an appropriate sized, and unusable, chair. 1 style of bed.  There is nothing complex to minecraft. Once you kill the wither and ender dragon, you are basically done with that aspect of the game."
starbound,3a10t3,lazarus78,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"You can measure ""complexity"" in a variety of ways. Starbound has lots of features, but I wouldn't call any of them all that complex -- not even wiring. A great deal of the fun of Minecraft is in taking relatively simple blocks and doing a lot with them. Combine cubes, slabs, and stairs into decorations, use a handful of circuit materials to create complex machines, etc.  In games like Starbound and Terraria, the level of detail is actually too high to allow the same kinds of creativity. If you want a decoration, you plop down that decoration. If you want a particular logic gate, you make that kind of logic gate. I personally don't find it nearly as fun."
starbound,3a10t3,Socrathustra,3,Wed Jun 17 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"16bit computer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XYo6CCKQcU  The wiring in starbound is much more compact allowing for a lot more  configuration over redstone, which cant even go up walls. Needing to build each logic gate manually doesn't make it better. Plus starbound wires are invisible and take up 0 space.  By the same token, needing to stretch your imagination to achieve a specific theme or style doesnt make it better either. Starbound has objects, so does Minecraft, but Starbound actually uses them on a larger scale. Minecraft would too if entities weren't a pain for them to add... and if Mojang actually gave a damn about their userbase at this point. Simple things like chairs have been asked for since Alpha. Minecraft has grown stagnant. Starbound is still young."
starbound,3a10t3,lazarus78,7,Wed Jun 17 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"I remember reading something about conolizing planets or something to that effect. I think that would be a massive bonus, something to aim for. It feels like walking along a beach, it's nice, there's thing to see, but it's all the same really. You can make a sand castle here and there but it's nothing impressive.   If there was a ice cream cart I'd build near that and be all, that's mine I'm close to something I want. And people will build near as well and it would feel a he'll of a lot nicer being with people and comparing castles.   We need something to aim for, our ice cream cart.  But that's just me."
starbound,3a10t3,maximlus,21,Tue Jun 16 22:57:29 2015 UTC,"well, I'm not a dev by any sane standard. (although the standard seems to be real loose these days...  twine..  I have done art..) and I don't work for you.  you certainly have no need to answer to anything I say. one issue is releasing too early apparently.  there was an obligation felt to give fans/players something to play with, when alot of the groundwork was needed. that is understandable really.  I suppose I would like to see a roadmap.   What is the plan?  I mentioned world gen which I find still very lacking. Terraria had 1 world.  in this world had basically everything.  creating a good starting point for Multiplayer.    and progression was tied to biomes, so you could hit walls in your world, where you had to turn back. hopping from world to world was done via logging out.  I feel someone in the creation process saw that as a good place to start, and incorporate the world hopping into the core of Starbound. The universe gen creates progressivly generated ""infinite"" worlds.  Allowing us to explore lots of worlds. but, the worlds have ended up really boring.  undergrounds have nothing.  Players split up across worlds and ships, kill any sense of MP server unity. Colonies of course will help with that now, and so did/will the teleporters. but, what was the point of ships, now we have colonies going?  we had player mods, crafting player made ships.   Devs created prefab ships though. Why prefab, vs the player defined ones of the mods?  why focus on ships at all, which.. spread players out, and mess up player building. Back to world gen again,   biomes do not really interact with each other.  npc populations, or actual biome generation.  They are almost entirely cosmetic here.   Is there a plan here?  are we getting procedural gen dungeons?  biomes with vertical layouts?  Biomes with big caves, biomes with little caves?  Ice caves running into lava?  This ""ice planet"" nonsense is kindof horrible. Basic question of design.  how many planets is a player expected to visit?  With rng fetch quests galore... ugh. Some of the games current direction seems to want to be a bit more Metroid.  the ship missions, the prefab challenge rooms, etc.  Which.. ok.  The RNG stuff is largely not working.  but allow me to suggest the game should be designed with players visiting 6-10 planets total.  Beyond that is purely for exploration.  Why even are those missions totally offworld?  why is floran party not spawning ON a world, which you get sent to?  Running a circle around 6-10 planets alone for a moon emblem is seriously boring.  Less planets, more on each planet.   this is something that effects everything.  a base system.  all the weapons, npcs, ship UI, ship, etc would all be built off something this basic.   resulting in you doing everything over to match, like the ships, like weapons, etc all have already had several passes to be put in line with changes."
starbound,3a10t3,MBirkhofer,-4,Tue Jun 16 22:28:54 2015 UTC,So you want undergrounds to be filled with a variety of novel items...  but you don't want them to spend time doing art and tech demos for a variety of novel items?
starbound,3a10t3,lexyeevee,10,Wed Jun 17 06:08:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting, what in your opinion do you think we could be doing better?   1) exploration needs better rewarded.  Right now you go to planets and just mine everything up, grabbing what is interesting, and having it fill up your inventories and chests so much you can never do a thing with it.  You need a better inventory system.  You need more reason to collect and explore planets (Think mystcraft in minecraft, planets could have an ocean of molten gold occasionally or something).    You need some sort of AE (Mc mod) like chest system that someone can set up with a lot of work (maybe hire colonists to do it?).  The different categories of items need to be separated out with all things falling under it easily accessed.  Say you want a chair, you click ""chairs' and then select your wanted chair.  2) Enemies need to be more unique and different.  They need to be less varied on a single planet.  They need to be more ""weighty"".  Right now they feel like terraria mobs.  Cannon fodder the game throws at you to hurt you.  I would like them to feel like wild animals, things you find and are interested in, things that can do interesting or unique things.  The system shouldn't just be ""this one shoots fire!"" because players will find all the interactions and get bored fast.  There needs to be subtle and definite changes to biology and things like that.  So ""find a territorial pet that is able to be domesticated or pacified with food.  Place it in this rink with these animals and it should help you kill them"".   Look to spore, strangely enough, to see a bit of how they did this.  Also animals need to be less diverse.  There should be 2, maybe 3 species per planet, all fitting into X number of ""roles"".  So there is a predator, a prey, etc, and they all have different stats and systems behind them.  3) I want to see more to the colonies on planets that you discover.  I would like to be able to starve them of food, or watch their populations change when I give them larger farms.  I want to see them react to my destroying their places, and I would like to see them congratulate and reward for me adding to them.  Shops should trade in money, but also should use regional currency you have to get by selling to that city. Only advanced/spacefaring colonies should use real credits.  4) the quests system feels like a stupid little fetch quest every time.  I want to see more ""I want you to make this planet do X"" or ""I need you to deliver me a large shipment of Y"".  Complex tasks that the player has to solve on their own with their mind rather than just going and collecting things for rewards.  Secondly, quest rewards should be appropriate.  I don't think I have ever gotten a sword I wanted or used so far."
starbound,3a10t3,Tripanes,5,Wed Jun 17 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add more to your comments, seeing as it gives me a few ideas:   I agree. Exploration should be rewarded, but the game lacks the variety of rewards. Usually it's just techs, weapons, quest rewards. Why not add in some weird artifacts? They can be equipment or furniture that could help or harm the player. Maybe an obelisk that cause NPCs nearby to go hostile. Or perhaps a backpack that gives your guns infinite power for a short time. It adds to the discovery, and even more so if they came up with super epic dungeons to hold them (this could be endgame stuff). As for item organization go, I want the send to ship function back. Upgradable and sortable lockers should be a thing. More animal behaviors could be added. Some have the pack mentality, some are solitary apex predators, and some just retreat into their shells when other people approach. Right now I can see only a few behaviors: Hostile, cowardly, or indifferent. Note that within these 3 basic behaviors, there are many variants within them. So far the basic implementation is done, and what we get from them seems to be a place to shop and rent. I'd like to see these tenants level up to some degree, and they can provide more services and rent. I saw the hunter gatherer and love the idea of item gathering.  Also it's better if we could have some npcs depend on others. Maybe the first colonist you'll have is a Mayor, and having him will allow you to get more colonists, and leveling him up increases the maximum colonists on that planet. And if a colonist dies, you can't revive them unless you have a doctor or regeneration facility on the planet. Quests are too fetchy. Needs more stuff like bounties, documenting new wildlife, scanning planets."

You've created a fantastic universe with a really nice clean style of pixel art that manages to be retro-looking and modern at the same time. The foundations for a great game are set, but it's definitely missing what makes a great game great.  Some people aren't going to like this, but I think you need to punish players more. Currently in the game there's no risk - you can't starve to death, you can't really die, your ship is never threatened, and the universe is generally very safe. The player is constantly given a choice of whether they want to put themselves in danger or not, and while the vocal people on this forum might agree with that, it's not what makes a good game. A good game will threaten the player and give him/her no choice but to defend themselves or lose everything. The hoarders who play games like Starbound don't like losing their stuff, so think up some ways in which people will lose everything if they don't play intelligently. And if people really throw a tantrum, you could always add a ""no challenge mode"" for those who like to be bored and safe.    Maybe there's some kind of universal scourge that's constantly searching for signs of life, you have to use technology to hide from it. If it finds your planet or ship it will bombard you with space zombies or parasites or something. You have to clear the zombies/parasites/whatever and then fly up to the mothership and destroy it. If you fail, your base will be overrun and it will become a ruin.   Maybe there are space bandits that trawl through space looking for signs of life, and then swoop down on the planet to attack and ransack. You have to fight them off or they'll steal all your valuable items.  Maybe you could make the high-tier machines powered by some kind of extremely rare elements.   Maybe if you make a big farm, it will attract pests you have to exterminate.  Maybe you could add moral problems like the hoards of refugees that would have escaped from Earth - does the player house them and feed them, if yes/no then that will create an entirely new set of problems. If you house them, they'll fill up your base and they'll complain if you don't build beds and housing for them, or if you don't build a source of food, hygeine, etc. If you refuse to house them, they might settle on the same planet as you and start raiding your base.   Give us random events while we're flying our spaceships, maybe there's an abandoned hulk drifting in space, maybe there's a situation similar to Erchius where you have to defend a colony from space zombies/parasites/robots, maybe there's an asteroid with a distress beacon stuck in it that you have to follow to a nearby planet.     Right now the game is very soft and friendly and girly, apart from some cool missions like Erchius everything is cute and pretty, and there aren't really any consequences for your actions. Games like this are fun for a while but are ultimately boring because there's no conflict or intrigue. Most people don't want missions where you make a cake, or find string, or play some music. They want to feel like they're surviving in a dangerous environment and making a difference by doing things nobody else has the balls to do. In my opinion you need to bring out the dark and dangerous side of your universe and make players start taking risks."
starbound,3a10t3,Pointless_arguments,4,Wed Jun 17 07:57:30 2015 UTC,One problem I have is that a lot of the blocks feel useless. There's no difference between an item and dirt if neither do anything.
starbound,3a10t3,Dr-Narwhal,4,Wed Jun 17 02:57:19 2015 UTC,"The general consensus seems to be that the biggest problems lie within the gameplay itself. At the end of the day pixel art of food is only so cute and can only hold so much novelty, whereas solid game mechanics are what essentially makes a game.     But the reality of the situation is that we have to choose which of these areas to focus on at any given time, as it's just not possible to tackle everything at once.   exactly. choose to devote a chunk of time to figure out what you want/can do with the game mechanics. Fix monsters, restore/fix mechanics, questing and all gen in general. Then people will lose their minds over 100 new food items, instead of raging like they do now."
starbound,3a10t3,caretotry_theseagain,3,Wed Jun 17 04:25:04 2015 UTC,"Just sit down and read the rest of this thread, and see if there's a core problem from what you see. If you can identify that problem, perhaps it would fix everything else.  Usually we are complaining about small problems, but those are just symptoms. If you can find the disease, the solutions for other problems may just come naturally."
starbound,3a10t3,Darkpursuer,2,Wed Jun 17 07:43:53 2015 UTC,"Redundancy and uselessness of interactions with items and mechanics. Too many pointless items, not enough uses. Game mechanics that do not meet expectations set by promotion of pre-order of EA SB, or of a good game in general."

I assume map formats aren't changing ever again (lost a few worlds to that) but a BSOD on the machine I was using as a server corrupted the entire world.  Start over again?  No thanks.  I know there are many play styles for people, and some like to ""prestige it"" and level over and over and over again.  My group got very attached to what it built, and feeling it torn away kind of killed the magic for us."
starbound,3a10t3,francis2559,3,Tue Jun 16 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what happened to our group, too. First time was during one of the early updates that wiped characters/universe, second and third was when the client on the host PC crashed and corrupted all our data. I know the game is still in beta and snags like this are inevitable, which is why we've shelved the game for now and will pick it up further down the line, maybe at 1.0. We pre-ordered back when we thought it would be the release version, not Early Access, and that was over two years ago with still no official release date in sight. I know that it will release when it's finished and that complaining isn't going to make devs work any faster, which is why I've never written about my frustration with the game until this post. I just really wish I could feel confident rolling a new universe and having fun again without losing all of our progress."

starbound,3a10t3,Wavestrike,2,Tue Jun 16 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"Imagine you release a product. You might release it to a hobby store. It might make it, or it might not if there's not enough interest. Because it's a hobby store, it will have a tighter knit community, and your consumers will generally be more friendly and charitable. Or you might choose to release it in a massive chain store. You'd invest more in publicity, and get many more people to buy your product, except you'd have to deal with the consumer retail horror stories you'd read about. Customers would have a much more informal relation with your product, and some might even turn hostile, without even giving you a coherent reason for it. Because it's a much more informal relation, some customers will be primarily motivated by economic concerns, others might be motivated by personal concerns, and some might simply be motivated because they became tired of it.  Correct me if I'm mistaken, but you removed hunger and temperature due to similar concerns from similar sources. Now you are getting people criticizing that decision in much the same regard. I'd recommend you get your head out of the spin zone, take advice from the constructive elements of the community, and don't pay that much heed to the side that bandwagon on vague threads like this one from people who might not even know what they want, at least not if you don't want to end up with something like this. Personally, no big complaints from me, but if I did have them, mentioning them in this environment would just make me part of the problem."

starbound,3a10t3,justbeast,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:59:50 2015 UTC,"Supernorn, my main question to you (and to the developer team) is -- why not shorten the release and testing cycles? And actually take advantage of the Unstable branch?  You already push live in-progress updates to Nightly. This is fantastic, a great way to do continuous integration / delivery.  And Stable gets updated once every few months (couple times a year?) with giant updates.   Why not push smaller, more focused updates to Unstable though? (Instead of waiting for giant all-in-one updates to stable). You added adorable non-monster wildlife critters? Fantastic! Why not release just that to Unstable? Changed the way ranged combat is done, and now weapons are tied to armor, etc? Awesome (I really like the new mechanics). But why not partially release it to unstable, again?   Is this a limitation of your tech stack or infrastructure? Do you guys use SVN or something (instead of a DVCS like git), or not do feature branches that you can easily release?"
starbound,3a10t3,justbeast,2,Thu Jun 18 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"Weeeell, it's a bit faster and easier to make more art assets than to tweak or add gameplay, and it's not like artists can just hop off their work and start coding the game."
starbound,3a10t3,Bradasaur,26,Tue Jun 16 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"sure. but have you ever followed the development of like.. .every other game on earth?  where in new features are added in with placeholder art?  and art is done later, just before release?  Progress IS being made ok.  but it seems very wasteful.    Ships vs colonies for example.    drills/axes earlier were one.  yes MM upgrading is way better. but its an example of devs going in one direction, then totally changing their minds.  and we had one MM upgrade system based on ores which was decent, replaced with a nonsensical RNG mm upgrade component.    no idea what that is about.  to be added to RNG challenge rooms?  Challenge rooms and mini-dungeons themselves...  the game was sold and built on RNG progressive generation of planets, monsters..  now that has not worked out well.... but, here we are with them making PREFAB dungeons. totally going against that progressive generation principle.    Game design is iteration.  so, on some level this build, tear down, build makes sense.   but this level of tearing down is alpha level. not late beta, and not early access, and certainly not ""preorder"" as many of us first bought in as.  At this point its best to simple give up all expectations and promises, and just hope it gets finished and is something enjoyable when it does.  Progress is being made."
starbound,3a10t3,MBirkhofer,2,Tue Jun 16 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Well worded arguments dude, ignore the pre-teen downvote brigade."
starbound,3a10t3,caretotry_theseagain,12,Tue Jun 16 20:27:56 2015 UTC,My main issue with it is just that the planets seem dead.  Nothing grows back or changes or evolves.
starbound,3a10t3,themeteorpolice,2,Tue Jun 16 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"Those things have been and are being worked on, actually. Animals found on a planet are getting more fitting color schemes based on the planet they inhabit, indicative of some kind of evolution, small passive life forms are being added to worlds, terrain will be affected by weather, and items to regrow grasses are being added."
starbound,3a10t3,Mackinz,6,Wed Jun 17 06:19:03 2015 UTC,"Putting grass back manually isn't a fix. The issue is that the worlds are dead, static places that only change if a player specifically clicks on a tile.  A world should have flora which can recover on its own, or changes that can occur without the player specifically clicking on each tile to make it happen. Just my opinion really, but planting grass one block at a time seems like a cheap work around."
starbound,3a10t3,themeteorpolice,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:48:22 2015 UTC,"I believe this is mostly a result of the infinite number of star systems. A computer can't keep track of everything, especially when ""everything"" (as defined by the worlds you've visited) is a constantly increasing amount.  I personally believe that Starbound might benefit from having only a few star-systems (still procedurally generated), but with large, distinct, and memorable planets, and a galaxy that actually  meaningfully changes as you play."
starbound,3a10t3,Trainzack,2,Thu Jun 18 23:44:07 2015 UTC,Agree completely. I don't need an endless supply of random planets if I could have even like 10 good ones.
starbound,3a10t3,themeteorpolice,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"No need to constantly update every planet. Just check the elapsed time on a revisit and update the planet then. There, easy."

starbound,3a10t3,Trainzack,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"Putting grass back manually isn't a fix.   Didn't say it was. However, it is better than grass never regrowing and, alongside weather affecting terrain, is definitely a sign that they are working on the regeneration of matmods (a.k.a. grass). Playing on Nightly, recently, the rare snow storms on a starter forest planet were awesome.  But I'm not sure what you would have them do to fulfill your other desires. Any ideas?"
starbound,3a10t3,Mackinz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and hope they continue down that path - re growth of grass, vines, flowers is huge.  Other than that, I'd say random events or spawns would be awesome. A ship crashes, leaving debris and wreckage, which changes the land a little at the crash site.  Maybe there are survivors - grateful or murderous!  Or meteor impacts. What about a plague that can take over a biome and change it (water to poison, that sort of thing).    I would be 100 % happy with vine / flower / grass re growth for launch though.  Those other bits can be future releases as far as I'm concerned."
starbound,3a10t3,themeteorpolice,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:29:16 2015 UTC,Oh so you're talking more about events that effect the planet after you have begun your plundering.  I think they need to finish building all the world types before starting on something like this.  Random events that could provide a unique experience for each player would be nifty.

starbound,3a10t3,TheSirusKing,22,Tue Jun 16 18:43:36 2015 UTC,I liked temperature and food. It meant certain planets needed a lot of preparation and you needed to grow food or hunt to survive.  Kind of hope they put the option of those back in at some point.
starbound,3a10t3,Axius,5,Tue Jun 16 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"It's just odd they axed it. Was it removed because people complained about it, or is it because they want to simplify the progression to a mere ""equip this, problem fixed""?"
starbound,3a10t3,Darkpursuer,8,Wed Jun 17 07:34:22 2015 UTC,"Wait, wtf, when did temperature get axed?!"
starbound,3a10t3,caretotry_theseagain,8,Tue Jun 16 20:01:20 2015 UTC,Yup.  Now you just need to progress the storyline to get specific suits automatically to go to certain planets.  Otherwise you just lose health steadily on those planets
starbound,3a10t3,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,6,Tue Jun 16 21:13:27 2015 UTC,A couple of patches ago :(
starbound,3a10t3,TheSirusKing,4,Tue Jun 16 20:45:57 2015 UTC,"This is my only real qualm with the game, it used to be a survival builder. When they axed temperature and hunger it moved over to an exploration builder. Which is still a valid type of game, but I liked starting out with nothing and building up. Now I feel like I start with nothing and am forced to quickly gain power."
starbound,3a10t3,The_nickums,17,Wed Jun 17 09:39:56 2015 UTC,"When they removed hunger I had no reason to settle down and start a colony, no reason to farm, no reason to keep food, but or sell or discover it at all."
starbound,3a10t3,Jayfrin,10,Tue Jun 16 17:04:18 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I believe the option to disable hunger by using Easy mode and enabling it in Normal and above would be a good compromise for those who didn't like dealing with hunger.  Investigating the food buffs on farmables hasn't revealed anything worth spending time on. It's mainly health regens. I can cover my health with nanowraps and such just fine without need for regen bonuses.
starbound,3a10t3,Baraeris,2,Tue Jun 16 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'd like to disagree with making hunger a Normal and above thing. As a veteran Terraria player, I can tell you that some people love difficult things, but losing your items and having to retrieve them is tedious. Keeping extras of everything so you can survive while retrieving your main gear is tedious. Always worrying about losing the cool stuff you find is tedious. It's not fun in the least. Hunger? That's fun. Having to keep fed is very fun. I'd like Hunger back, and I do not want to have to play on a higher difficulty to get it. In communities I frequent, I've heard the various difficulties above Softcore in Terraria nicknamed Tediumcore and Tardcore. I think the names are quite fitting."
starbound,3a10t3,Soundtoxin,-18,Wed Jun 17 08:59:11 2015 UTC,"Building is its own reason, but food still has several benefits to its use so you should stop being a drama queen and farm up some Desert Salsa."
starbound,3a10t3,Mackinz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"There was no point bothering to farm when just looking around for vines and getting plant matter was so much quicker. Farming is near pointless now, no way around that."
starbound,3a10t3,Tieblaster,0,Wed Jun 17 09:48:03 2015 UTC,"Plant Fibre from crops was never the main attraction. Food was always the main attraction and food is not ""near pointless"" now as food can be extremely useful with the buffs each kind of food provides. One such food, as I mentioned, is Desert Salsa, made with Currentcorn, Cacti, Beakseed, Automato, Kiwi, Feathercrown and provides the following effects:   Jumpboost - 25% for 180 seconds Thorns - 60 seconds Maxhealth - 30% for 165 seconds Health - 95% for 60 seconds Wellfed - 330 seconds   Definitely not ""near pointless"". Food, as is in the current implementation, has gotten me out of several jams while playing the game. :/"
starbound,3a10t3,Mackinz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:47:26 2015 UTC,"But people are more content to bitch because there is no hunger bar anymore, and gloss over all the cool stuff food does now.  However, they could have the best of both worlds: useful food, AND a hunger mechanic. I don't find hunger ""fun"", per se, but it has it's place in the game and a great many do enjoy the mechanic.   So I say give foods buffs AND add hunger in. Everyone wins. but make hunger a toggle option in the options menu , rather than via difficulty level"
starbound,3a10t3,sayterdarkwynd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, sayter, I disagree. I don't think a hunger mechanic introduced into the game should be wholly optional. However, I do think one added back in should not specifically have a higher impact on people AFK. Minecraft has a hunger bar that doesn't deplete if your character stands still, and I rather like that and would like to see that in any hunger mechanic Starbound develops.  In addition, difficulty should affect how hunger affects the player. On Casual difficulty, you shouldn't die if you are starving. That's just annoying for people who want to play the game on casual. It should provide negative buffs if your hunger meter is empty, and positive ones if it is full, but it shouldn't kill you outright. Higher difficulties can have the hunger bar kill you, though.  Plus, Starbound needs some form of ""food saturation"" like Minecraft, too. It makes sense that some foods keep you fuller longer, so that is a definite yes."
starbound,3a10t3,Mackinz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with an ""inactive = no hunger"" mechanic, for sure. If it was done in a way that wasn't a chore like before, I'd be fine with a non-optional one.   Your dificulty curve option is actually a much better idea overall. It takes the bite out of it for the casual players like myself, and lets the hardcore players get their insane challenge. Everyone wins.  And yea, for sure on the different foods filling you different amounts. And just for fun, they need to make any ""chinese food"" last mere seconds, to go with the ""you're hungry 30 minutes later"" meme :)"

starbound,3a10t3,TheGiik,6,Tue Jun 16 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"Nostalgia is one thing, but Minecraft still has several huge systems that are broken or confusing to use. They're finally touching combat in the next update, but they worked on XP and Enchanting before and even though it's better, it's still confusing and not really rewarding. Same with potions and dungeon-crawling/exploration. Years after releasing out of beta, the game still sometimes feels like a skeleton."
starbound,3a10t3,Whilyam,5,Tue Jun 16 20:18:25 2015 UTC,Mostly because if you don't mod it heavily to the point of basically making it a neww game...it's JUST a lego set.

I've pretty much jumped ship and started palying Terraria again, and with Terraria: Otherworld coming out, I doubt I will ever play this game again."
starbound,3a10t3,HeadHunter55,9,Tue Jun 16 18:11:37 2015 UTC,You and me in the same boat. Terraria 1.3 coming will be awesome.  SB is also the reason I haven't done early access again.  I'll just wait until the finished game before buying.  That being said Starbound has excellent potential and I truly hope they can hit their mark and wish them the best.

starbound,3a10t3,BowsersaurusRex,43,Tue Jun 16 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"WARNING: I know I'm probably sound like Starbound/ChuckleFish can do no wrong in this response. I love the game, so I'm obviously going to be super biased. There was a point, though, for quite a while where I didn't play. I was of your opinion that it wasn't headed anywhere and I feared that CF had abandoned the project. I was fresh off the Towns debacle and was certain that I'd stumbled into another scam-ish situation. I'm glad I was wrong.  The devs (at whatever pace you deem it) are implementing a bunch of new features for the game.  What a lot of people like to compare Starbound to is Terraria. That's a fair comparison; they look similar, they work similar, they were made by the same people (sorta), so that's not a terrible comparison to draw. The problem is Terraria is a different beast all together. It's been said time and time again that Terraria was more about combat and creeps and bosses than exploration and homebuilding.  Starbound, at least in its current state, is almost the opposite. It's more about seeing what's out there; different planets, different settlements, and then mining the hell outta them until you can build the fanciest castle/spacebase/underwater dome you want. Of course there's still work to do for CF, and yes it should have been done faster. As far as I'm concerned, though, they've been transparent about their missteps and are working to provide a more meaningful game for their customers.  Combat and citybuilding are getting major overhauls with colonization being a big part of the nightly directions. (Speaking of, if you haven't played the nightlies, do so. They're wonderful.) If you were to look at the original release of the alpha and then the current nightly, it would feel mighty different.  I for one am happy to see CF's progress and their apparent dedication to keeping their customers happy. I don't know how far off the 'finished' product is, but I've definitely gotten my $15 worth of gameplay."
starbound,3a10t3,WraithofSpades,24,Tue Jun 16 13:10:26 2015 UTC,"It is disingenuous to even say that starbound and Terraria were built by the same people, sorta.  The only connection that they have staff-wise, is that Tiy did a lot of the artwork for Terraria.  Since artwork is visual, it has nothing to do with building up the game itself and creating the systems that are in it."
starbound,3a10t3,IngwazK,3,Tue Jun 16 15:06:55 2015 UTC,"That is true, but think about the art and look of the game. I responded below that people seem to view Starbound as being Terraria in space, which it's not nor was it supposed to be. CF wanted something drastically different from Terraria and brought a massive universe to their players."
starbound,3a10t3,WraithofSpades,9,Tue Jun 16 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"The problem is that if you want a game to be about exploration, you have to create things that can actually be found. There has to be a reward for exploration. Discovering another procedurally-generated Glitch village where there's nothing to find gets stale very quickly.   I'm not saying that this game is dead and I have faith in the developers, but I don't think the issue with the current version of Starbound is just a difference in philosophy -- it really is just incomplete. IMO, they are going to need the ""bosses and combat"" if they want players to actually feel like they're adventuring. The good news is that NONE of those things need to be linear, and new content can be added ANY time. It could be limitless."
starbound,3a10t3,Eminor3rd,0,Tue Jun 16 22:41:04 2015 UTC,So the issue is that a game which isn't fully finished is incomplete. Interesting.
starbound,3a10t3,The_nickums,4,Wed Jun 17 09:30:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's all I said."
starbound,3a10t3,Eminor3rd,4,Wed Jun 17 23:59:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like half of the people complaining here don't opt for Nightly or follow the blog updates.   I started playing when it picked up traction back on Steam. Since then the entire ship system has been overhauled, as well as the loot system, crafting tiers, questline( there didn't even used to be one really), NPCs, the entire space station/ARK, weapon models, creature models/abilities, and finally the tool system.   These things aren't even just simple updates but complete overhauls of core game features, and people are trying to say it ""hasn't made any progress"". Maybe not towards being a stabby shooter, but it was never supposed to be that in the first place."
starbound,3a10t3,The_nickums,3,Wed Jun 17 09:35:11 2015 UTC,"I get the same feeling which is why halfway through my posts I usually have to re-read and then state I'm playing nightlies. I'm well aware they're very different from the stable so I try my best to make sure that people understand I'm playing nightlies.  And to be fair, there was a time where the nightlies were almost unplayable they were so broken. Maybe a lot of players still think the nightlies are that."
starbound,3a10t3,WraithofSpades,2,Wed Jun 17 11:42:48 2015 UTC,"The thing about the Nightly is that it's playablility comes and goes. Some days it works and some days it just doesn't. I saw some posts where people said that the devs are just throwing things at the nightly so we'll have more content, I don't think everyone fully understands that the Nightly is basically SB:Alpha test, and the unstable is SB:beta test, while the stable that most play is just the stable."
starbound,3a10t3,The_nickums,6,Wed Jun 17 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"Terraria has 5 dungeons and 5 biomes, everything is just concentrated on a single map therefore feels like more"
starbound,3a10t3,NaughtyMayor,6,Tue Jun 16 19:27:47 2015 UTC,Possibly. I think the big thing people tend to expect from Starbound is for it to be Terraria in space. That's just...not what Starbound is but it gets faulted for not being Terraria+.
starbound,3a10t3,WraithofSpades,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Trying to think Starbound being like Terraria is about as valid of a process as Overwatch to TF2. Sure, each game has similarities and fall in the same general genre. But they are entirely opposite-ended spectrums."
starbound,3a10t3,SileAnimus,5,Tue Jun 16 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I agree that there's a lack of vision, or even activity. I think we're still seeing improvements along the lines of adding progression paths, and the colony updates are a decent step towards the executive-level play I like in sandboxes (like the warlord path in mount & blade, or building a diverse business in X3). I feel like the beautification of the game and adding power to mod tools is still progress, and really important progress."
starbound,3a10t3,bluedesertgondola,9,Tue Jun 16 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think things are starting to shape up nicely.  I do agree with one aspect you mention that I would love to see improved: planets are, generally speaking, boring.  One planet (of the same type) is the same as the next, just with a few swapped graphics and slightly different creatures.    However, I think the devs are laying a nice solid foundation for future updates, and robust modding being factored in from day one will mean, hopefully, that the game will become nearly anything you wish of it, in time.  Mods to expand exploration, deep crafting, puzzles, combat, customization, etc.  I really do think the game has a bright future, I just hope it makes it there before that bright spark fizzles out."
starbound,3a10t3,Shit_Fazed,24,Tue Jun 16 15:48:18 2015 UTC,"There's actually been a pretty clear vision of it for some time. It's just that the development of it takes time. If you want to follow that development then play the nightlies.  Right now they're working on the big colony update, iirc."
starbound,3a10t3,duckmurderer,4,Tue Jun 16 13:05:18 2015 UTC,What's the big colony update? It sounds nice!
starbound,3a10t3,perortico,9,Tue Jun 16 14:34:57 2015 UTC,http://playstarbound.com/colonies-and-endgame/  It's not just buy this deed and spawn this dude to build a colony. It's also item dependent as they're adding new information for every item in the game to interact with the colony systems.
starbound,3a10t3,duckmurderer,5,Tue Jun 16 14:38:45 2015 UTC,"Such a great feature,  thanks for sharing!"
starbound,3a10t3,perortico,3,Tue Jun 16 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"It really depends where they go with it. Right now it feels like they have built the set and now the props, I hope the next priorities are gameplay then story."
starbound,3a10t3,adamdreaming,3,Tue Jun 16 19:09:27 2015 UTC,This thread is like a year late.
starbound,3a10t3,MammothErection,12,Thu Jun 18 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"It has taken a while, but I'm glad they've committed to making this game the best they can make it instead of just calling the current game Starbound 1.0 and moving on. I'm really eager for them to implement Steam Workshop support though so the community can keep the content going after Chucklefish (understandably) gets tired of it."
starbound,3a10t3,Russeru,14,Tue Jun 16 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. They have no idea what their goals really are in the long run and its obvious. They're just chugging along hoping a viable plan will form itself along the way. The idea was solid; a spiritual competitor with Terraria with a ton of the features it lacked. The devs quickly became overwhelmed with people comparing the content in Terraria to Starbound, so they kept adding more. It seems as if they'be dug themself into a hole with the nightly builds. People expect these bulls to have stupid little things like extra colors on butterflies, which leaves no time to implement features which require weeks to develop. They're so concerned with pushing out anything for the nightly, that they won't just sit down for two weeks straight and grind out meaningful gameplay changes."
starbound,3a10t3,ikeepadreamjournal,7,Tue Jun 16 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"which leaves no time to implement features which require weeks to develop   You have a solid point you're making, but I don't agree with the part about them not managing their development time correctly. A lot of people overlook the fact that the individuals at these game companies developing content and those developing features are not the same. You have devs working on enhancing the engine and adding new stuff while the artists are adding those extra colored butterflies.  Now back to your point, I'd definitely like to see a revised roadmap with their new plans because right now all I know is they are working on colonization. Maybe the road map exists already, I don't follow this enough to know. I've basically put down Starbound after playing the last two huge stable releases and decided I was going to wait until the first major release where the game is mostly done before I continue playing."
starbound,3a10t3,friendlygummybear,8,Tue Jun 16 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"I understand how a game studio is structured, I was generalizing for brevity. My main point was though; if they are managing their time correctly, why don't we have a clear and concise development schedule that is (for the most part) on track? I'm not underestimating how easily a project like this could get out of control when put in the hands of software developers. But that's why, when studios get to this point, they hire people to make sure things are kept on track and they hire people to manage their time for them. I definitely think the only thing Chucklefish needs is more administrative/project management staff.  Edit: a good example of this is that guy making Stardew Valley or whatever it's called. I'm super excited for that game, but he's so slow. Chucklefish slapped their logo on that shit and its not making them any money at all. They're letting that one guy work on it by himself when he should have at least one other person from the main studio giving him support. He also should be held to a development timeline. Just like a professional game developer is."
starbound,3a10t3,ikeepadreamjournal,6,Tue Jun 16 16:07:16 2015 UTC,"Chucklefish needs is more administrative/project management staff.   I could agree there. My company practices agile development and for a while we were pretty self managing and didnt need anyone to help us. Once we got a real SCRUM master who specialized in keeping us on track and focused, I was surprised how much it helped."
starbound,3a10t3,friendlygummybear,4,Tue Jun 16 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah people like to think they can run a game studio with just their vision and know how. But it's a business that needs to constantly turn a profit function. And people aren't going to keep buying Starbound if all the reviews turn into ""Good game, but hasn't had any meaningful features added in over a year"" or ""Pretty fun but..."" And that's where your project manager comes in and figures out a plan to keep fresh content rolling out on a regular basis."
starbound,3a10t3,ikeepadreamjournal,3,Tue Jun 16 16:14:45 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate on what you mean by meaningful gameplay changes? What sort of updates would make the biggest difference to you?
starbound,3a10t3,rhaokja,6,Tue Jun 16 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"I want core game play elements such as colonisation, building, teleportation, combat and enemy spawning to have already been at an acceptable level of functionality before superfluous additions like more items were added. Feature-creep is the perfect way of describing this situation; we have a ton of stuff, no way of making it work and/or practical uses for it."

I don't understand this fucked up development plan where you add shit half-assedly and then spend the rest of the time adding ""realism"" in the form of another color swapped butterfly. Meanwhile you have several systems that are just broken, un-intuitive, or poorly-made."
starbound,3a10t3,Whilyam,4,Tue Jun 16 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"That's all not to mention some major problems in the game, like substantial lag in singleplayer, and the big one for me: Spawn Galaxy recycling (all my spawn galaxies are exactly the same, including the changes I make, so all chests are empty, core fragments are slowly being drained away, etc.)."
starbound,3a10t3,pickten,4,Tue Jun 16 15:52:52 2015 UTC,I hope the Devs see this post. I feel this way about SB too.
starbound,3a10t3,MyManNesty,4,Tue Jun 16 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be a downer or to diss on the genre. But that's just a staple of the open-world RPG genre itself.   With expansion of playable area, the game takes more time to be made due to properly fill of all those areas. This is also the same reason why Go-On-Your-Own-Adventure books are so short. As a counter to this I would point out Terraria-- Where the world is in fact rather small, but it has densely compacted content within it, thus making it feel full; This is mostly since the game was made using the Windows Game Maker program, instead of being entirely coded from anew. Whereas Sarbound has HUGE and nearly infinite space to plug content into it, and since the game is made entirely from scratch (unlike Terraria), it takes time to get all the features good and right. And even more time to make all the features synergyze and work properly.  Starbound (unless some sort of godly event occurs) will always teeter on that edge of being ""good but not entirely fulfilling"".    I myself have no issues with this of course, I am a patient person and would in fact be willing to watch Starbound be developed until it is a work of art."
starbound,3a10t3,SileAnimus,2,Tue Jun 16 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"It's the problem with most early access games, they make a very ambitious goal and fail to reach it. Minecraft is successful because it never really had big goals, it's a sandbox building game."
starbound,3a10t3,FireHawkDelta,4,Tue Jun 16 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Mhm. Minecraft has always been more like a ""pack of cards"" than an actual game. People make their own games and fun from Minecraft. No other game can really replicate that."

I had just fired the game up again for the umpteenth time and closed it down after about 15 minutes with an ""ugh"".  I apologize to the devs if it came off harsh, but considering the nerve it struck with everyone, it seems others feel the same way.  Understand (devs), we love this game, love it's potential and just want it to achieve the greatness it deserves.  And after the 'colonies', I would stop trying to make it bigger and concentrate on making what we have now the best it can be.  (oh, and bring back the survival and collecting aspects of the game)  Not to name-drop Terraria again, but look how great that game is with ONE planet you never leave.  More isn't always better.  We see how thin things have been spread, literally, over a thousand planets, so more isn't always better."
starbound,3a10t3,Yetanotherfurry,0,Thu Jun 18 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"Personal grudge against chucklefish aside, I never felt like starbound has anything worthwhile to offer me. I mean sure flying around scavenging things was kind of fun the first time around but the same old survival formula that boils down to a long and frustrating hunt for rare minerals while everything else piles up in your inventory, it doesn't hold up well for repeat performances.  Then I tried building things and I'd find myself constantly looking at the clock impatiently, everything took so long, I'd try and lay down a floor and it'd take nearly 3 minutes just for the floor of one room, never mind how long it took to gather materials in the kind of bulk.  Then the quests came and they were just hardcore platforming sections that couldn't have felt more out of place, in a universe that was already boring me I suddenly found myself walking and jumping more than anything.  Starbound has more or less ruined the entire survival/crafting sandbox genre for me."

Tier progression would have been differently marked and have different requirements to go up, such as including quite elaborate crafting quests. SEGWAY!  The other thing that changed was the questing system and the way the story would progress via the questing system. Believe it or not, each race was intended of having their own campaign story. ANOTHER SEGWAY!  The jumping from planet to planet/ universe system uses different mechanics than those that were going to be originally intended to be implemented, which is my main gripe with the game.

I can't argue about certain things being axed, though. But, my point is to reserve judgement until there is a final product. We can, at best, speculate on what their whiteboard at the office has all over it, and as to what is a final feature and what is not.   Thanks to the great improvements in the last while, I'd say they are going in the right direction since the major stable push a couple months back. And let's not forget that we didn't see a major update for such a long time because of the bitching non-stop of any sort regardless of what they chose to do, schedule wise. Frequent updates? People whined about them being too small. Waiting? People complained because it took too long. So they wisely opted to do it at their own pace.  White-knighting is a stupid term that has no business in this argument. You can't go claiming ""white knight"" when all someone does is say ""hey, I like this game despite its current flaws"", which in Mackinz case is exactly what you did.   Now, if he was vehemently arguing against ANY negativity for any reason despite everything...that's a different story entirely. There's a definite difference between the two things.

Not to mention how impossible it was to have a constructive critical discussion when he can't  deal with criticism. look again to see how he reacts, to use your words, he vehemently yelled at the slightest hint that everything isnt rose tinted like he thinks. With regards to your comments on development, thats just noise. Unfortunately i've been a Tiy fan since his ""blue"" days in terraria, even after the plagiarism fiasco and knew about the SB concept long before you most likely.. so anything you have to say on SBs development is either old news, missinformation or blatantly not true and spawned from rumors, especially with regards to production delay. Did you know that for a year after the concept was released and donations started coming in, tyi actually had to TEACH his team how to code, on top of teaching the mess of a codebase supernorn's been losing his hair over? yeah... White knights, to repeat myself, are the very cause of the problems with this game in conjunction to devs with no previous experience. Devs dont know any better and just listen to the soothsayers, then freak out like 2year olds when the soothsayers get drowned out by the public. I repeat again, cuz i understand you dont like re-reading previous posts, i love this game and the dev behind it despite ALL the shortcomings. This does in fact grant me the right to want what i love to not be led astray by whiteknight soothsaying children and be critical of its shortcomings so the world can see how awesome what i love is, not how much capacity i have to love something imperfect.

But then they started changing it and now I think they are going for a ""2D-Minecraft"" kinda of thing.  I don't really enjoy just building things, I really enjoy the journey Terraria offers. There is an end to the game, yet there isn't one. You can progress in any pace you want, and there are several different ways to get there. Even the randomness of Terraria has some logic to it. Starbound had one-dimensional mobs and random weapons system that made it impossible to start a new character and be able to follow a ""build path"" that you've already done.

As for accusing you, I apologize. How quickly the comment you replied to was downvoted seemed to indicate that you were the one responsible, and I was annoyed because I've been downvoted for typing non-aggressive comments (like the one where I only say I like to play the game... why does that deserve downvoting?). People have been downvoting me a lot in this thread, and, while I can understand downvoting my ""stop being a drama queen"" comment, I don't understand why people downvote me for saying ""the purpose of food in the game was never obtaining plant fibre and there are reasons to obtain food in the game right now"".

starbound,3a10t3,moosefingers,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:54:17 2015 UTC,"I agree very much with what's being said here. The direction Starbound is headed in makes me so sad because I see a massive amount of potential with the core gameplay that is being squandered. I used to be able to play for hours without getting bored and now I lose interest after a few minutes. If the devs were willing to take a step back and re-evaluate the core gameplay a little, Starbound could be an excellent game.  As others have said, survival has been written out of the game, but exploration and building aren't rewarding enough right now without it. Bring back hunger. Give me a reason to grow food so I have a reason to build planetside early in the game and am rewarded for it. Bring back temperature. Give planets temperature/poison/radiation levels that are variable, and give armor variable amounts of protection to match. This ties upgrading armor to the planets I can safely explore, and it gives planets more variety. If I can find random armor that might be better than what I have now, great. Even more reason to explore. Right now getting a magical suit that allows me to visit an entire tier of planets that are all essentially the same is not fun at all.  The devs are working hard and I love the universe they are building. I really want them to succeed and to love this game, but right now it just isn't very fun."

starbound,3a10t3,Mackinz,-4,Tue Jun 16 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"Complaining about the loss of ""survival"" mechanics in current Starbound? Dude, if you thought that there was any  greater difficulty to surviving in Starbound back in the Koalas than there is now, you were absolutely terrible with your starter seeds and tiered armor/torches.  The quests can be annoying, yes, but the missions aren't boring. They are actually very exciting, IMO, and a stunning replacement for the old ""spawn a boss fight"" mechanic.  Plus, not having every planet filled to the brim with villahes or dungeons (assuming that's what you meant by empty) logically makes sense considering the sheer number of planets in the game (even with Space Edits to reduce the total number of stars, the number of planets is close to infinite), goes easy on people who just want to build, etc. What should be done is the addition of a feature on the starmap UI which can display whether or not sentient life has established itself on a viewed planet, then you can't really complain about emptiness.  And they do have a vision for it. You know the Ark thing you can access from a gate? That's going to be part of the story of Starbound, alongside several other things they've posted about on the blog like the ""Caretaker"". They are trying to do many other things to improve the game at the same time, like improving the items system for better variety, adding new randomly generated images, attempting to reduce the annoying need to throw away weapons after you upgrade your armor, etc. but that's nkt random as those improvements will ultimately help improve Starbound significantly in the end."

I spent over 300 hours playing a game called 'Nosgoth' from closed beta to open beta and the game has gone through very much shit.   It all started because the devs made some decisions to take the game in a direction some of the players didn't like. They posted salt and replied to the devs attempts at community outreach with passive aggressive salt. In turn this made the devs stop caring, it's quite obvious if you look at the state of the game, they added loads of micro transactions and effectively stopped listening to the community.   Salty players makes for salty devs which makes for dead game. A salty post is the wrong way to fix any problem."

starbound,3a4l53,AuMielEtAuxNoix,4,Wed Jun 17 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"About the small and larges pile-of-ore (you know the ones that shakes when you ""harvest"" them and takes a few seconds to pop) is there a difference between ""zapping"" them direcly and waiting or zapping the ground under them and make it explode really fast? Does it give less ore or something? Is that supposed to happen?    Zapping them directly is the main way to mine. Zapping the ground under them will not give you any more ore.    Is there a way to, with chests and such, do like Loot All or Quick Stack like in Terraria?    You can shift-click to loot things more quickly, or if you want to loot all just zap the chest to break it and pick everything up including the chest.    Is there a way to get back to the ship or surface quickly when deep in the planet? Like the mirror thing in Terraria? I do know that I can teleport from the planet's surface.    Not a specific item no. If you're desperate you can type /admin, teleport, type /admin again. You can also try different methods, like this cool one using water.    I bought a teleporter for $3000 but I guess it stays where I will put it right? Teleporters will stay where you put it yes. You can zap it, but you will only get the teleporter core back. Why is the ""Mushroom Guy"" NPC that is selling weapons changes his inventory every second and/or with every click? It's a bug I guess? As others mentioned, yes that is a bug. Is the number of pixels in items' description their future ""sell value"" when selling is put in the game? It seems so random, often items that were hard to come by are worth nothing...    It is how much it costs for you to print that item at your ship's 3D printer. If an item says 0, it just means you can't print that item. But yes, when selling comes next patch that may be how much you can sell things for.    I cooked some cool food but their description doesn't say what they do when eaten. I had to bake a cake for a quest, are they only for quests and selling to NPCs for pixels?    No, almost all food does stuff to you, it just doesn't say in the description. You can see what all foods do to you here: Consumable Items table    Do items store in the many chests and boxes on the early game ""Gate-City"" thing stays there of will it get looted as soon as I turn my back?    If you loot an item from the Outpost, the Outpost will just generate a new one. That world is not ""saved"" because several quests use the items in the containers there, so it makes sure they are always there for you.    Are pickaxes supposed to last only a few hits?    Yes, they are just meant to give you a little boost. Your Matter Manipulator (zappy thing) is your best mining tool, but you have to upgrade it many times. So if a pickaxe is faster for you, go ahead and use it until it runs out.    Last but not least, when is the game expected to be completed?    Probably 6 months or so. The next big patch should be within 4-6 weeks.   I do know that this game is Early-Access as in ""not finished"" but still, it can get confusing and you often feel lost and alone...   It's okay, we're here to help ;)  We try to keep the official wiki up to date as well, it can be quite helpful for small stuff, but I know a lot of times you may not be sure what you're looking for, so it's hard."

In this case, hitting them with weapons and ""zapping"" the ground underneath with the matter manipulator work faster than trying to harvest them directly. In fact, they were made for weapon-bashing as do the little white pods that drop pixels and flares/torches/ropes."
starbound,3a4l53,Tsuruda,2,Wed Jun 17 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought yea, I was thrown off by the ""shake when you harvest them"" because that's everything and I thought they broke pretty much instantly.

starbound,3a4l53,SupaSlide,2,Wed Jun 17 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, it is a very optimistic timeframe. :/  I think the main gauge for when release is coming is the main missions, the nebula, and the black hole. They have 2 missions complete, with around 6 to go. Of those 6, the Avian mission is very far along, the Apex and Hylotl are making progress, and the aren't really in the game yet.  So the next update will have combat and the framework for colonies, then probably 2 or 3 more Stable patches after that before release.  That's my guess anyway. I'm not including a crap-ton of features big and small, like the ones I report on near daily, just a super high level picture. Could be 8-9 months.. I'm hopeful it won't be more than a year though."
starbound,3a4l53,Varixai,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"I would love for it to be sooner rather than later, as long as nothing is rushed."
starbound,3a4l53,SupaSlide,3,Wed Jun 17 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"1  Those piles can be zapped with your matter manipulator, and be dug up from underneath, but you can also hit them with a weapon to break them right away, same as the little white pods that give you pixels.  4 The teleporter is meant to be put in a base/farm/any location you think you'll come back to a bit. It lets you travel to it's location without needing to fly your ship there.   9 The Matter Manipulator is your main tool, the pickaxes are for when you need to do a little bit of something that would take a long time to break."
starbound,3a4l53,Jacapig,2,Wed Jun 17 07:17:34 2015 UTC,"Elaborate on ""Zapping them"". If you mean just mining them, no there isn't really a way to make them go faster. Desert planets are great when you find TONS of ore in the sand and can start an avalanche as the Ore becomes free when you do that. You just have to locate it and pull it out of the sand. Sadly, no. Not yet. Using a teleporter is your only option. Else saving/quitting is your next best option because... reasons. Yep. Once it's placed, it's placed. Breaking it will only give you the core. Glitch I assume. However all NPC's inventory is randomized. There's no set inventory for them. Yes. Selling will be implemented ""Soon"". Next patch I believe. They're healing items. What each one does is different and you'll only know once you eat it. Even then you'll have to remember what it does. You mean the Outpost? No idea. Yes. Pickaxes are supposed to be strong but only last a few hits. When it releases. It's been in ""Beta"" for a little under 1 and 1/2 years now. Hopeful release will be January of next year, least that's my hope."
starbound,3a4l53,CrashmanX,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:50:42 2015 UTC,Sand mining has been removed for months >_> do you even play this game anymore?
starbound,3a4l53,Milguas,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"No. Not at all. Never.  They removed sand mining but got such a negative feed back they put it back int, to a lesser degree. You now find significantly less resources in the sand and less commonly does the sand spawn in a way to cause sandvalanches."
starbound,3a4l53,CrashmanX,2,Wed Jun 17 17:59:48 2015 UTC,"1 Zapping the ground under them has the same effect as mining them. Is it supposed to? IDK. Is it faster? Never timed it. I would guess that some materials like sand would be, while rock might not be.  3 If you're feeling cheaty and you're on easy mode you can just commit suicide to get to the surface quickly. I usually dig straight down, and then use the grapple (later tech) to get up  4 The ship comes with a teleporter, you only need one if you want to ""save"" the planet you're currently on. Usually unnecessary in early game.  5 Probably a bug. The Mushroom Men are savages, they have no economic system.  6 I never use pixels except to buy things I need for a quest (like eggs) or when it's required to build something (like a metal station?). Pixels are mostly used in the Pixel Printer, it kind of like Creative Mode from Minecraft, but with a budget.  8 I don't know if there's a looting system for NPC's. Maybe in multiplayer?  9 NEVER build a pickaxe. They used to be the way to go, but they were UBER nerfed. Upgrade your Matter Manipulator instead. (same thing with Drills, never build a Drill)"

starbound,3a1evn,MysticB,2,Tue Jun 16 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"Edit because some people hide child comments by default: Healing is broken in Nightly at the moment. Unstable is fine, but Nightly crashes when you heal with foodstuffs, bandages, health packs, etc. If you want to keep playing Nightly while healing is broken, I recommend using /admin mode. This makes fighting boring, as you don't take damage, but lets you explore without worrying about healing.    Well, it's called unstable for a reason. I'll give it a shot once unstable finishes downloading. Can you tell me anything about specific situations? Are you taking any sort of extended damage (fire, poison, etc.) while taking the med kit? Do beds, healing water, and food do the same thing?  Also, operating system? Dunno if it's relevant, but it might be. Never know.~  Edit: Also, Unstable or Nightly? Healing doesn't crash me on Unstable. (Garden planet, while not taking continual damage. Also just tested with continual fire damage from an explosive status pod. No crash. Windows 8.1, using openGL)"
starbound,3a1evn,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:38:03 2015 UTC,I know its unstable for a reason. I didn't expect it to be perfect. Hell I like QA. I'm happy to test new stuff. I wanted to make the post about it in case it was happening for anyone else.  There was no extended damage happening at the time. Tested it under various situations.  First found it at half health after getting hit by a monster. I healed with healing backpack bought from merchant and crashed.  Booted back up and tested with bandage from merchant. Crashed  Deleted bandages and tried to craft one. Crashed.  Varified cache in steam and still crashed. So I made this post. I am out for an hour or two but I can test food stuffs when I get home.

starbound,39wugh,bradyonly,8,Mon Jun 15 16:40:42 2015 UTC,I'm using a liquid sensor. You can see them just barely below each platform. I like them there as a cue to the player of where he will be going.
starbound,39wugh,KoboldCommando,6,Mon Jun 15 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"that's it, liquid sensor. IMO it would be crazier to hide them completely (not that I noticed them in the vid), but still this is one of the coolest dungeon features I've seen on the sub."

starbound,39wugh,XenoXilus,2,Mon Jun 15 18:08:08 2015 UTC,These dungeons can be found on the nightly from challenge rooms.

starbound,39y90d,rockit2guns,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:43:02 2015 UTC,"Dedicated servers are a feature, and a very important one, think of it like owning a house compared to a hotel room, it's simply not the same, owning the server is infinitely more customizable and provides you the freedom, and yes, building a server (like a home) is not trivial.  On the other hand it's also very easy to learn how to do. You just have to learn how to do proper port forwarding and set your firewall accordingly and you're good to go. If you think you won't be capable of it, I think you shouldn't run a server of your own anyway as you won't be able to debug it, solve it's problems (this game is early-access, remember) or prevent griefing - which is going to happen even if your only playerbase is a couple of friends.  Also, don't forget that running game servers are also a commercial business,  and you can simply pay such a service a cheap monthly price to get them set up everything for you."
starbound,39y90d,aranel_surion,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:19:22 2015 UTC,I think my whole issue would be solved if they made editing the server settings easier by integrating it into the game/launcher so you don't have to watch random YouTube videos that may or may not be relevant to the current version.
starbound,39y90d,lazarus78,0,Mon Jun 15 22:21:25 2015 UTC,That would be stupid. You would be unable to run more than one server if they did that. You are expected to have a level of knowledge and understanding when attempting to run any kind of server.
starbound,39y90d,themrpiggy22,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, we get that you know how to set up servers and want to run five at a time. All OP is asking is for help setting up his ONE server to run on the current version. Rather than stating how you know how to set up a server, and that everyone else is incompetent, why not actually share your knowledge. Some people don't know how to port forward or which IP to use, so cut some slack dude.   TL;DR OP wants help with server, if you just want to complain, just don't"
starbound,39y90d,lazarus78,0,Tue Jun 16 13:35:02 2015 UTC,"Actually he didn't ask anything about setting up a server.  I do share my knowledge, regularly. Help people set them up all the time. However, I don't help people who are too lazy to put in the required work. Port forwarding is simple. There are literally thousands of guides on how to do it, hell there is a WHOLE WEBSITE for nothing but specific instructions on forwarding for every know make and model of router in existence."
starbound,39y90d,jWobblegong,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"Because the way servers, networking and the internet work is actually an insanely complicated mess. Many game genres take care of it for you (because they wouldn't function otherwise) but that's a false sense of security. It's much more akin to dealing with machine code and computer guts than it is to coding a Hello World.  I sympathize with the hassle-- I find it hugely frustrating too, because all I want to do is play the game, not spend hours/days/weeks Googling and teaching myself networking! Unfortunately for now (and whatever future I can forsee) this will continue to be A Thing. My only advice would be to go with some kind of service or site to have someone else deal with this hassle for you. Maybe someone more knowledgeable than I could chime in with names/addresses for you to look at. :)"
starbound,39y90d,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:55:10 2015 UTC,"Having steam integration means the game can no longer be DRM-free. It would mean you -need- Steam open to play on servers.  Starbound as it is, is pretty great. Port-forwarding is fairly easy. Running the Starbound server is fairly easy. Changing the configuration in the file to match whatever port you're forwarding, is fairly easy. Finding your external address is fairly easy. This is all stuff I only recently learned how to do, and it only differs slightly from person to person. The basic steps are all the same.  Maybe your friend isn't entering the proper address or port."
starbound,39y90d,lazarus78,0,Tue Jun 16 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"Because this is how it should be. You are trivializing all of networking because you can't seem to figure it out. Please stop. You are basically shitting all over my profession when you do that.  The reason why a lot of them don't work is because the game has changed a bit over time. The process has changed. That is to be expected for a game still in beta. But server's do work with minimal configurations, all you have to do is ask."
starbound,39y90d,lazarus78,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:19:33 2015 UTC,You are saying it should be harder than all other modern steam games where you can join friends?

How am I shitting on your profession by noting how unintuitive it is to set up a server?
starbound,39y90d,lazarus78,-1,Mon Jun 15 21:43:40 2015 UTC,"If servers ran through steam, then it would make running more than one server impossible. It would require pointless overhead and limit your control over how it functions. Running the software and doing some extremely simple forwarding is not difficult. You are just lazy to think it is. There is a reason why I and others in the field get payed as much as we do."

starbound,39y90d,lazarus78,0,Mon Jun 15 22:11:27 2015 UTC,My job matters because server/networking is what I do. You are trivializing the process because you have no understanding of why it works the way it works. You are complaining over 2 minutes of work.
starbound,39y90d,lazarus78,2,Mon Jun 15 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"I have been trying to figure this out for hours. I know it may seem simple to you, but there are some of us who can't wrap our heads around networking. I don't know what is causing the issue where my friend and I can't join each other. Maybe it's because my apartment has control over the modem and is restricting port forwarding, maybe it's because we're incompetent. Maybe I'm just making excuses because it's frustrating to me not being able to understand. So I definitely can see where OP is coming from."

If you want it to be a carbon copy of Terraria, you'll be disappointed because it is it's own game, but if you want a variation on the theme of Terraria, you're in the right place. There's a bit less focus on leveling up and recipe advancement as compared to Terraria (from the relatively little of Terraria that I've played), but there's more focus on exploring the universe and the unlimited (practically speaking) number of planets that you can visit.  Also, my favorite bit of emergent gameplay has got to be the Martinus Transformation. It let's you turn one liquid into another due to a graphical bug, thereby letting you alchemize any amount of any liquid you want with a little work and time. You can even make some fancy wired machines, but I deliberately kept mine low tech. This is extremely satisfying to me."

Second of all, the Creative Mode mod allows you to roll random weapons until you get the one with the modifiers you want. Be warned though, that excessive use of that mod breaks the difficulty level.  If you want to directly modify a gun, you are going to have to learn a little about the game's coding. Find out what tag does what and then directly modify your gun by using http://c4isbad.com/starreader/ Then you have to download the new save file and close Starbound completely.

I will admit that acquiring enough materials the first time is a bit stressful, as the crafting process is a bit complex and requires items the mod specifically adds, yet once you have your little lightbringer floating above your shoulder it is all the more rewarding.

To perform the maneuver, simply dispense water above your head while jumping, then hold the Up arrow.

starbound,39su56,WraithofSpades,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:47:42 2015 UTC,"My self-generate lore is pretty basic. I have several ""origin"" stories for my PCs and those origins affect their starting equipment (by way of /admin commands).  Grandfather's Armor - The ship you commandeered has been in your family for generations. Your philosophical differences made stealing from your family somewhat more palatable. While fleeing, you accessed the storage locker and found an old, dusty suit of titanium armor. It's well worn but in good condition. Based on the various other debris in the locker, you assume it once belonged to your grandfather. The last of the erchius gave out and now you're drifting in an unknown system. Well...at least you'll be better protected going in.  Upgraded MM - These ships aren't exactly easy to come by. Small, sleek, and designed for exploration. Science vessels are by far the best escape plan. Too bad you got fired upon while leaving. Now you're drifting in a strange solar system with barely enough power to move. You did locate a new matter manipulator, though. And it looks like it's been tweaked a little bit.  Make it Rain - It was a daring mission. You knocked over the armored car with little more than a pea-shooter and a little bit of luck. Bankers deserve that for hiring less apt guards. Upon fleeing, you overloaded the engine and ruptured the FTL. Lucky for you, the ship's emergency protocols got you into orbit above a strange planet. Since you had nothing better to do, you check the storage only to find a large sum of pixels, though less than you'd hoped. Seems like the car hadn't made many stops before you got your hands on it. Oh well, better than nothing.  Arsenal - You picked the wrong ship. You had to escape; your own kind hates you and you couldn't exactly stick around. But why did you have to take that ship? You found several titanium weapons on board. Not good. You booked it out of there only to find that the previous owners hadn't really maintained the engines very well. Now you're drifting in a new system with nothing but the clothes on your back and two menacing weapons in storage. Maybe you'll make it out OK, for now. Better hope the owners don't decide to find you."
starbound,39su56,WraithofSpades,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:57:46 2015 UTC,I love origin stories like this. I wonder if there would ever be a function for servers where you could leave trails for an epic original quest.

starbound,39pdvn,loudambiance,3,Sat Jun 13 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"It saves sooo much time. I definitely agree with it being a top-priority item in early-game. It gave me incentive to fully explore the surface for surface chests, although this practice usually resulted in me dying in the jungle multiple times.  I wonder if something similar could be implemented in Starbound? I feel like a straight magic mirror replacement would be OP, but maybe a 1-time use device that will teleport you directly to the surface immediately above wherever you are? Make it so it can only be crafted at the ship's 3D printer, so it can't be crafted on the go, and you'll have to think ahead to bring one. Then make it moderately expensive, maybe 600-1000px, so they're not used too extravagantly. It could even drain your energy upon use, or apply debuffs, leaving you exposed for a few seconds after the teleport. That's just a few ideas on how it could be made to not be OP.  Modders, how feasible is something like this since the teleportation code seems to be pretty solid at this point?"

starbound,39pdvn,AuraMasterNeal,4,Sat Jun 13 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"the reach is decent, but the main benefit of using it is that it requires no placement of things on your part, as you can grapple onto cave walls. I'd recommend practicing with it first, as the fall damage can kill you if you're really not careful."
starbound,39pdvn,The_nickums,3,Sat Jun 13 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Other good thing is that you can build 2. Unlike climbing rope that takes two hands and requires for you to fall while changing grapple locations, the grappling hook allows you to literally spider-man around."

Or am I missing something?  To answer your question: I usually go with option 1, unless I know I'm not far down and can easily get back up within a few minutes. I play on casual, so I only loose some pixels."
starbound,39pdvn,Aldrenean,3,Sat Jun 13 14:13:22 2015 UTC,"You're correct about option 2, sorry, I've never actually done it myself and am not that familiar with teleporters. So I guess option 1 is your safest bet assuming you've got the pixels to spare?"
starbound,39pdvn,SeaJayCJ,3,Sat Jun 13 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"This is old news, but maybe someone doesn't know it: your ability to beam back to your ship is determined not by whether there are blocks over your head, but whether there's a background wall behind you. If you get high enough that the skybox layer is sky instead of earth, but you're still underground, try using a hammer to break a 2x3 hole in the background dirt. You should be able to beam out of that hole. Depending on the terrain you're going through, this can save you a few hundred blocks of vertical climb."

starbound,39pqoc,RNGGG,29,Sat Jun 13 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd say the combat is not as engaging as Terraria. That being said, I believe a combat update is in the works soon, which should improve things a bit.  HOWEVER, this game is a lot more about building and exploration than Terraria, and there are a lot more options for customization and decoration. The Devs also seem to have a lot of vision for how they want the end-game to be, even if they are a bit slow about updating it. I've probably put in at least 100 hours of play time, so I'd say it was worth the 15 bucks I paid for it.  Just my two cents."
starbound,39pqoc,EightApes,2,Sat Jun 13 16:14:32 2015 UTC,I remember a lot of controversy a few months ago about the devs ditching the project or something. They're back now? What was that all about and should they be trusted to finish the game now?
starbound,39pqoc,__________________c,45,Sat Jun 13 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"Storm in a teacup.  We never ditched the project.  Never left, never came back.  We just work at our own pace.  This pace wasn't fast enough for a vocal group of people."
starbound,39pqoc,OmnipotentEntity,10,Sat Jun 13 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. I had the game on my wishlist for a while and I remember checking the reviews awhile ago and seeing the community going apeshit with negative reviews. Sorry, I didn't know the full story. That being said, I just bought the game. Good luck with the future of your game!"
starbound,39pqoc,__________________c,17,Sat Jun 13 18:43:59 2015 UTC,"The devs never ditched the project. What you were reading was the entitled whining of a bunch of people who didn't like that updates were taking longer than expected.   To remedy this, the devs released two optional builds that you can opt into playing (instead of the regular stable release): unstable, which has some of the new features that are mostly ready to be pushed to live, and nightly, which (as the name implies) is updated every night and is often buggy but contains the newest of the new features.   Chucklefish often gets flak for being slow in updating, but make no mistake, they have never abandoned this project and I doubt they will until it's fully finished."
starbound,39pqoc,MagicianXy,3,Sat Jun 13 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'm super happy that they broke it up into two different build options, even though I don't use the nightlies.

starbound,39pqoc,Boogiewoo0,13,Sun Jun 14 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"The combat is actually currently getting a SECOND overhaul. The terrain generation is still rather bland. But I'm 90% sure that's getting an overhaul too. Colonies are on the way which are awesome (personally) and gives you incentive to build on a planet. It has teleporters (and bookmarks) now which make getting back to your favorite locations a lot easier. The quest line is short, but still very engaging. Modding is also super simple if you DO get bored. Also, I'm not going to forget - the game IS still in development, so it's great being along the ride as it grows.  In my opinion, it's definitely worth 10$"
starbound,39pqoc,Wulf_Oman,8,Sat Jun 13 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, for 10$? Jump on it. The game is still under dev and it has a long life ahead of it. Can't go wrong for 10$.

starbound,39pqoc,Sento_Fernner,6,Sat Jun 13 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"If you like the genre, you will enjoy Starbound, even though it is unfinished. You will, however, get more hours of it than your average more expensive game, even in its current state, so it is a yes for the worthy of $10 part.  But if you want a more consistent and complete experience from the start, you should wait a little longer for the 'final' version.  edit: as others said, combat is currently worse than Terraria's, as you have no incentive to kill normal monsters. As for the world, they are definitely beautiful and have great ambiance, but they are kinda all the same, which ends being rather dull. But they save something Terraria doesn't have, which is a greater variety of random structures that can appear in the surface and underground."
starbound,39pqoc,dgmdavid,7,Sat Jun 13 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"I've been posting this in a couple of places lately, hopefully it will help you as well. It's a comparison between Terraria, Starbound, and Minecraft - three games which are similar but distinct.    Terraria Starbound Minecraft    Lots of different enemy types, AIs, bosses, attacks, etc. Almost literally infinite types of enemies, but attacks are all very similar. Still entertaining to fight against. Set amount of enemies, but most of them are (relatively) interesting to fight against.   Different ""tiers"" are separated by whatever ores you can get your hands on. If you find enough higher tier ores, you can completely skip tiers. Tiers are separated by bosses and quests. It is very difficult to bypass tiers - you need to go in order (at least up til a certain point). Very similar to Terraria, but even more pronounced. If you want, you can skip from Tier 0 (nothing) to top tier (diamond) within an hour of playing.   Only one finite world, but many large and varied biomes within the world. Infinite worlds with decent amount of interesting biomes on each. Most biomes do not have any super special features, however. One infinite world, but biomes are mostly the same throughout (no ""special"" biomes, or not many).   Hundreds of unique items that change the way you play, combat wise. Infinite number of different weapons, but all very similar. Not much variety once you've seen the common ones. Small number of weapons, but they can be customized with enchanting.   Lots of decorative blocks to use for building. Incredibly massive amount of decorative blocks for building - like, a whole shit ton. A very nice amount of decorative blocks.   Contains NPCs that are memorable and entertaining, and makes you actually care about their well-being (can't buy stuff from a dead merchant). Has many, many more NPCs, but most are just clones. (This will be changing in an upcoming update - new plot NPCs are being made.) No NPCs that you care about, unless you want to trade with them.   Clever wiring system that can be used to make powerful traps/farms, but also limited because logic is hard to accomplish. Haven't played with it, but IIRC there are logic gates pre-built and you just need to wire things up to make neat traps/farms/contraptions. Arguably the most verstile wiring system (redstone), but takes up a lot of space and is hard to learn for newbies.   Mods are hard to find and even more difficult to make. Very easy to find mods, and making your own mod is almost trivial, even with little programming knowledge. Mods require some programming knowledge to make, but are ridiculously easy to find.    Final verdict: Personally, I like Terraria best out of the three, but that's because I like the combat aspect.  To me, Terraria is more focused on combat and power - once you learn the locations of all the major points of interest (dungeon, jungle, temple, etc.) the game is really about collecting as much gear as you can until you can beat all the bosses. As such, combat is tighter and more varied. Starbound, on the other hand, feels like more of an exploration/building game. You travel to multiple planets, discovering new places as you go. Once you decide to settle down, you have tons of tools at your disposal, not to mention the hundreds of decorative blocks available. Minecraft is a mix between the two, IMO."
starbound,39pqoc,MagicianXy,2,Sat Jun 13 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"Is modding Starbound really /that/ easy? I haven't looked into it much, but it seems (from what I've seen) just any person can pick up the game and change stuff."

starbound,39pqoc,MagicianXy,2,Sat Jun 13 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"yes, modding mostly revolves around creating a json text file (anyone with a text editor and some copy pasting can do this as the categories within are mostly logical)  adding assets or sprites to the game is slightly more challenging but it makes sense once you figure out the system (defined fields and attachment points mostly)"

starbound,39pqoc,TanzNukeTerror,2,Sun Jun 14 06:49:11 2015 UTC,"On the worlds thing for people unaware:   Terraria allows something similar to Starbound's world jumping. You can open as many new worlds as you want, and you can move between them with your character and items. The biomes are pretty much the same in each new world though.   There's obviously a difference between the two mechanics, but Terraria isn't limited to a single, finite world."

(It was back before you could edit the keybindings without editing an .ini file and I wasn't going to bother for an early access game when I had others on my playlist.)   But I came back to it recently and found a much more mature game that I'm really enjoying. It has a lot of great differences from Terraria (although a few things, like inventory management, could benefit from being more like Terraria). Exploration is pretty cool with the variation of the planets. The worlds and their populations are procedurally generated and theirs enough content now that the planets feel meaningfully different.  That said, there are lots of changes I think that the devs still need to make, but you can regularly see them displaying bits of WiP on their twitter feed and other sources. So that's reassuring."
starbound,39pqoc,CircumcisedSpine,2,Sat Jun 13 21:41:18 2015 UTC,Just bought it yesterday. Very fun. Worth the $10 so far
starbound,39pqoc,Big_Green_Piccolo,3,Sun Jun 14 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"I switched to Starbound when it came out from Terraria. I find it more engaging than Terraria ever was. You aren't locked on a single world, and the variety and number of weapons and worlds are much larger.   I can't say the combat on an individual world is compelling, but there are instanced quests with bosses that make the game quite fun. The game puts a lot of emphasis on exploring new worlds and finding new things than straight up mining for better ore.   $10 isn't much, but different people view $10 differently. I'd say it's absolutely worth $10. Two hours work at minimum wage for a game that can give you hundreds of hours of fun.   You also aren't likely to get an objective view of it coming into the Starbound sub. Nobody here is going to tell you they don't like the game.   People here have been up in arms about updating the game. There are two builds: the Stable and the Nightly. The nightly is updated, you guessed it, nightly. The stable is updated whenever they feel like they've gained enough forward progress and put in the time to tie everything up into something that isn't broken. The nightly might [read: will] break your game. The people who are angry about the lack of new content don't use the nightly, where the people who are only happy with a game that doesn't crash all the time use the stable."
starbound,39pqoc,prowlinghazard,3,Sat Jun 13 22:08:11 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worthy of $10, or the usual $20, or $40 or $50, really. Sandbox games tend to have tens of hours played and that's well worth at least $10. Starbound's being updated far more frequently than Terraria and it's changed a lot since it's initial release. Terraria's combat system is much better IMO but there is an update to combat coming soon. Currently Terraria's NPC and selling system is better but the next update will also deliver a colony system and finally selling. Starbound has an infinite universe with infinite worlds and this is what makes it much better than Terraria's limited worlds. Starbound has randomly generated monsters unlike Terraria but pre-made bosses and quests like Terraria.   Honestly most will argue that Terraria is a better game and rightly so, Terraria has much more content but in the next few months Starbound's probably going to get on Terraria's level."
starbound,39pqoc,CrystaIGems,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:17:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you like Terraria, it's good. But the world feels bigger and more generic.

starbound,39pqoc,fugeeman,7,Sat Jun 13 16:02:52 2015 UTC,"Have you looked at any gamplay? I assume if you had you would realize that using a controller to play Starbound is a terrible, torturous idea.  In it's current state, anyway. They would need to totally redesign the inventory system just for you to be able to navigate it efficiently.  And even if they created an inventory system for controllers, I have no idea how you would ever be able to efficiently build. It works in a game like Minecraft because you can look around and move and the blocks are quite large. Starbound's blocks are small and it would be much more difficult to navigate with a controller, unless they implemented some sort of snapping feature.  All that said, there are rumors that Starbound may be coming to the PS4 and I would hope if that happens they would bring the controller support system over to PC as well."

That was fine. What WASN'T fine was the flame war(between players and other players) that escalated steadily, eventually spilling over into everything over the next couple of days. Starbound created some particularly vocal and entitled trolls that were so bad the whole game's forum is pretty much on red-alert until the game is truly finished."
starbound,39qpo3,Worpledorfl,-3,Tue Jun 16 01:11:40 2015 UTC,All threads worth closing. Nothing of value was lost.
starbound,39q1rc,AuraMasterNeal,3,Sat Jun 13 17:19:19 2015 UTC,this sounds like an exploit - like really cheap unfair thing. what if signs had a crafting cost/recipe?  are the light signs as strong as regular torches?  also cheap lights are 50px and are brighter than normal torches and work underwater.
starbound,39q1rc,astraltor,4,Sat Jun 13 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"It is kind of exploit-ish, it abuses the fact that signs are free. The cost, however, comes in the carpal tunnel from clicking ""print"" a couple hundred times. They seem to be a bit stronger than torches, though I can't be certain. And honestly, when I go mining and adventuring late game trying to get thousands of pixels for a build of mine, 200 cheap lights (assuming they have about the same light strength) is 400 blocks that I can't make."
starbound,39q1rc,Nidmorr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"Meh, currently on the nightly mining is so much easier with the addition of upgrades to the torch backpack which now lights up an entire screen.  Also another method I use is once I get access to cheap lights I replace torches alltogether. Just craft 500 of them and occasionally pick them back up after you explored an area and you're good."
starbound,39sobi,HSDEScrub,3,Sun Jun 14 11:20:51 2015 UTC,"The game is still in early access. The mech is the last boss in the current build. That being said the devs are working on new content as we speak. Some major features we've seen include a combat overhaul, the ability to create colonies for fun and profit, and two new missions with Avian and Hylotl themes."
starbound,39sobi,rhaokja,2,Sun Jun 14 15:48:52 2015 UTC,"Go explore the universe. Find a pretty planet and make it your home. Build a base, prepare for the colonization update.  Terraria is mainly about the combat. Starbound is about building and lore. The devs work at their own pace and seem to have a pretty good idea where they want things to go.  If you're not satisfied, install a mod like ""Frackin' Universe"" or ""Starbound Side Stories"". If you're going to build stuff, I'd recommend ""Rock Names"", so you can get something other than that generic cobblestone.  Starbound may not be as ""long"" as Terraria, but there's so much more you can do if you're not just hooked on boss battles.  The point of the game, at least for me, is to relax and take it easy during progression. Not to just try to get everything immediately. I've logged 422 hours so far, and I'm still satisfied with just making a new character so I can experience starting out again.  I make up my own stories about these characters and their lives.  You can even probably find a server and do neat stuff with friends.  There's loads to do if you're not just focused on what the game holds your hand through.  But yes, I agree the game can be fairly short if you let it."
starbound,39sobi,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"There will be more story content, bosses, quests, farming, colonization, NPCs, etc as the game progresses. It's not yet actually ""finished""."

Or send them back to their ship.  To add to that if anyone joins a server where the host has the mod, but they don't, it will do the same as stated above. (If they get within a vicinity of the player using it)"

starbound,39q99m,AuraMasterNeal,2,Sat Jun 13 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"The exception to this is custom guns I believe. A lot of times modded guns can be passed around from player to player, even on servers where no one has the mod. Simply because of the way guns are loaded. However, the harvester beamaxe mod is simply a ""gun"" with no energy use, 100 fire speed, and a custom projectile with no damage, yet it force-disconnects people, so the rule is not that general."

starbound,39r4c6,Varixai,3,Sun Jun 14 14:18:09 2015 UTC,"Not counting admin mode, as has already been mentioned, it sounds like you aren't going deep enough.  They are found in abundance right near the core. If you are going for those and nothing else I would probably dig in a style that is almost straight down, not stopping until you see the core below you.  Then go side to side a bit, loot the groups of core fragments, and head back up in the same tunnel.  Without any matter manipulator upgrades, this would probably take you about an hour total. Could be more or less depending on how focused you are avoiding distractions on the way down and up."
starbound,39r4c6,Milguas,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:52:09 2015 UTC,Find the mine that always spawns on the starter planet and just go to the bottom of it and mine straight down. Cuts down on a decent bit of digging

starbound,39odmc,The_nickums,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"Decided to take a crack at it. These were inspired by /u/Aerexes and his design here. However, he used the original Icon in the files, while I made the basic penguin (first one) from scratch. (This was because the fragmented bits annoyed me)  If you'd like a smaller (actual pixel-size version, not large like this) to make your own, you can get it here  If any of you have any requests for a custom icon like these (still has to be the infamous penguin) feel free to shoot me a message with what you'd like. If you do - it probably won't get done immediately, but hopefully it eventually does! Also, I'm not a master at pixel art, it's just a hobby, so if I can't figure out how to do your idea, I'll say so. Any ideas I get will be considered for sure though, and added to the album unless you don't want me to.  If you want a non-fragmented version of Aerexes' logo, you can find it here  How did I make the PNGs, icon files?    I actually didn't know how to do this at either first, so I asked /u/Aerexes how he did it, and this process worked (he told me GiMP is how he did it)   First I designed them in paint.net Used the resize function and made it by 200% (I think, but roughly for sure. The originals were far too small) I then copied+pasted it in GiMP (since .ico files aren't supported in paint.net) and saved it as ""PICTURENAMEHERE.ico"" (of course replace the first part with the actual name, if that wasn't obvious)"

starbound,39q2d5,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:55:43 2015 UTC,Doesn't custom ships require a mod though? I find it personally difficult to stick with the game when there's no survival reason for building anything at all.
starbound,39q2d5,Erotic_Asphyxia,2,Sat Jun 13 21:26:45 2015 UTC,"I mostly make machines using the wiring mechanic these days. I've had my fill of exploring, mining and fighting for now (a couple hundred hours or so), but that was pretty fun. Starbound doesn't have a real endgame (yet?), so I spend most of my time in admin mode tinkering. Maybe that is the endgame."
starbound,39q2d5,SeaJayCJ,3,Sun Jun 14 11:57:51 2015 UTC,"Not much going on at the moment.  It's still best to not have any buildings and just live on your ship while mining lots and upgrading your gear so you can upgrade your gear.  You can build nice looking buildings and that if you want but unless you're really into role playing or playing with a bunch of friends it's useless.    If you're new to this sort of game, I'd recommend Terraria over Starbound for sure.  Terraria blows Starbound out of the water in nearly every category, except for being able to use an upgradable ship/home to go to new worlds instead of moving to new worlds like in Terarria.  I've had the game for quite a long time but it's nowhere near being fun yet, I'm waiting for some huge updates/release before I try to get into it again.  So, if I were you, I'd just wait until the game is good/complete before burning yourself out on it like I have.  I have to say this because of the ""fan boys"" or I'll be downvoted to hell, it's a game with some potential but it's still quite a poor game as it stands."
starbound,39q2d5,RedStarJ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"Starbound has better graphics and soundtrack, imo. But otherwise, you raise some valid points. Terraria's gameplay is much more fleshed out."
starbound,39q2d5,SeaJayCJ,2,Sun Jun 14 11:59:50 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not a 'survival' game in the game way Don't Starve is (have it and loved it).  You can plant yourself in a hole in the ground and afk for 3 months and you'll still be alive when you get back.  There's little to no reason to grow food or make a shelter of any kind.    And now that you can't collect furniture, building materials and other items from houses you run across there's damn little reason to explore now or build your own place.  (I recently ran across a huge glitch town and there was no point in it even being there.  I couldn't salvage any furniture from the place and there was literally nothing going on there, just them running around back and forth doing nothing)  CF better get this stuff figured out or this game is going to die on the vine."

I couldn't salvage any furniture from the place and there was literally nothing going on there, just them running around back and forth doing nothing         From the wiki: Some dungeons, such as Apex Test Chambers and USCM Prisons, have a shield generator inside them that protects all blocks within dungeon boundaries from being mined. The shield generator can be toggled on and off by interacting with it. When a shield generator is mined all it drops is a circuit board. The shield generator is usually in the middle of the dungeon or village on the top of the building. This forces the players to go through the dungeon as designed instead of mining it immediately."

I don't know if I'm playing it wrong, not doing mods or whatever, but I hope they can get out of alpha/beta soon and have an actual playable game other than the 5 starting quests. Am i the only one that feels this way?"

starbound,39lerv,kessellb,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:33:07 2015 UTC,Nope. It's taking way too long for what it offers. The only significant thing that was put in is completely streamlined and boring questing.

starbound,39lerv,idg3t,4,Fri Jun 12 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"Terraria came out a little over 4 years ago and has had development on it for the majority of those years. Starbound came out a year and a half ago. I have played both games in roughly since their release, 400 hours in Terraria and (well steam says but I may have left the launcher open too long) 900 hours in Starbound. I can say from experience that Terraria felt empty and boring when it was in its early stages of development, much how you say you feel about Starbound now. So if you want a finished game with many years put into past its release, go for Terraria. Comparing the two does have some merits as they are very similar, but in progress they are vastly different, and the directions they are going are also very different. Terraria now for me is fun quite fun, but the progression of gather resources, upgrade tools, gather resources, upgrade tools, etc. is the same as Starbound on paper."
starbound,39lerv,HobbitFoot,2,Fri Jun 12 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"Not really true;  Terraria has had 3 years, 8 months of development time and Starbound has had 3 years, 4 months.  Why are they similar? Because Redigit took a 9 months hiatus in 02/2012, which coincides with the time frame that Starbound was announced. As much as I hate to say it, Terraria is still kicking Starbound's ass... and at the rate Chucklefish is going, Terraria: Otherworld will be out before Starbound even gets out of alpha (ermmm... Beta... whatever)."
starbound,39lerv,margaryna,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"I would agree that Terraria is a more polished experience. However, Starbound is definitely a lot more ambitious than Terraria.  Also, it seems like Starbound had to rewrite more parts as they were poorly designed than Terraria did."

They are both the same genre and relative style: 2D side-scrolling voxel based mining / build / survival game.  Yes, they have diverged within the genre and style in some aspects, but they are both still apples: Granny Smith vs Washington Red apples, to be more exact; they look very similar except the skin is a different color, and although they may taste different, they have similar texture."

Bottom line is that he's expecting people (the devs, in this case) to give him special treatment just because he thinks he deserves to be treated special. This is NOT a common or normal phobia, and if these devs catered to every phobia that exists out there, there would be a list 5 miles long of toggleable options.

""Weird stuff that can make people uncomfortable"" can apply to so much shit that's already in starbound, including but not limited to eyeball blocks, blocks of solid flesh, blocks made of human bones complete with creepy sound effects, and the (momentarily absent while they work to fit it back in) tentacle biome (complete with disturbing music). If you accept people demanding that the devs cater to their every tumblrina trigger, then you wind up with devs that aren't even making a game anymore, they're just spending a year writing code to disable things because some asshole says it makes them uncomfortable.

starbound,39jlhp,Neamow,44,Fri Jun 12 12:59:48 2015 UTC,Personally I strongly disagree. Colonies and combat are important features for a 1.0 label but pausing should have been a day one function. Its been a basic feature of single-player games for over a decade now.

Can confirm, I remember pausing my single player games on the NES nearly 30 years ago.   And pausing is a hugely important feature that should be worked on/added ASAP! As a father there are times when my daughter wakes and needs something. The ability to pause would allow me to better assess the situation, take care of what's needed, then easily get back to playing wherever I might've been."

starbound,39jlhp,SrDigbyChickenCeaser,12,Fri Jun 12 08:56:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Pausing is pretty much required. If it's not going to be in the game, the devs need to come clean and say it instead of leaving it in limbo."

starbound,39jlhp,arnulfg,11,Fri Jun 12 10:18:12 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The single-player game should be paused whenever I want/need.

starbound,39jlhp,KovaaK,14,Fri Jun 12 10:28:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty gross oversight. Pausing, and subsequently unpausing with a simple key press should be in every single player game. I wonder why that is not the case with Starbound.   Or else it is a design decision. If that is the case then the designer should explain the motivation. I can't think of a reasonable one."
starbound,39jlhp,Neamow,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:08:35 2015 UTC,"I believe this is mostly because you can't pause in multiplayer, and the game doesn't differentiate that much between single and multi. It will probably come after the servers get proper love and polishing, so they don't have to do it twice. It really shouldn't be THAT difficult to disable it in multi though so there's no excuse"
starbound,39jlhp,silverevilchao,7,Fri Jun 12 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"Jesus, this still isn't implemented?  Here, I wrote a script in AutoIt to suspend the process when you press the Pause key.  Haven't tested it with modern builds since I haven't played the game for over a year, but I believe it should still work.  Note the side effects mentioned in the thread.  If I remember correctly, I think leaving the game paused for too long disconnects you from even single player games (something on the order of half an hour or more?  It's really been too long, sorry).  Let me know if it doesn't work for you, and I'll give it another pass today or tomorrow."
starbound,39jlhp,vexxillion,3,Fri Jun 12 16:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, please, this has always been one of the most annoying thing about this game to me. Such a basic function should be present in every game. The fact that they haven't even acknowledged it is really weird."
starbound,39jlhp,vexxillion,3,Fri Jun 12 12:08:13 2015 UTC,I've been seriously wanting pausing myself too. Minecraft's single player uses the game's multiplayer code and it has pausing! Starbound's literally the only game on my PC where I can't seem to pause in it.

starbound,39jlhp,TheRealMouseRat,5,Fri Jun 12 09:34:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean? Like for multiplayer? I'm asking specifically for single-player where its a common function, rather than online where it is very rare. Although now that you mention it I'm sure that would be nice too."
starbound,39jlhp,marsgreekgod,2,Fri Jun 12 09:49:23 2015 UTC,I'm just wondering how it would function otherwise.

starbound,39jlhp,furtiveraccoon,2,Fri Jun 12 12:55:29 2015 UTC,one request when/if they add pausing. IF you try to pause in multiplayer a warning that you didn't pause.   just a thought

I'll keep trying to troubleshoot it."

starbound,39jlhp,Poiuy2010_2011,0,Fri Jun 12 17:26:40 2015 UTC,...Why don't you just draw a dirt circle around yourself? Basically the same as a pause button in this game (now that there's no hunger). It takes a fraction of a second longer than a pause button for the same effect.
starbound,39jlhp,Rahabic,3,Fri Jun 12 23:11:27 2015 UTC,Did you actually read the original post?   First: that extra few seconds actually matters for some of us.  Second: you can't do it at all during missions because you can't place blocks.  Third: it isn't actually safe depending on where you are. What if you are on a planet with meteors? Just hope none of them hit you?
starbound,39jlhp,Bismuthinite,-18,Sat Jun 13 01:26:31 2015 UTC,"I think what is off putting about OPs request is not the request but the way he put it.   Pausing is a trivial feature, particularly if the functionality already exists.  But the way you've requested it OP is pretty whiny.    It's a game, and its in beta. Some features no matter how simplistic will be missing. Priorities are based on a lot of things in development and the simplicity of a task doesn't make it jump to the top of the list. And that's assuming it IS simply. Apparently simple things are often more complex to implement then they might first appear. As many have mentioned there are alternatives. In fact the best one so far is quiting, requiring 3 key presses to quit the game. The difference between that and a pause while in menu is seconds, and as mentioned by many it sounds a bit egotistical to simultaneously say your relaxing playing a video game but at any moment your time becomes so infinitely valuable that you must have an immediate solution.   Just my take on it. It would be nice to have, but you could have requested it with less of a dramatic insistence."
starbound,39jlhp,PySnow,10,Fri Jun 12 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"As a father to a one month old, it's absolutely possible to be relaxing one second and be needed elsewhere in the next second. If I was playing Starbound and my son started crying, I usually have a two second window in which calming him is possible, otherwise I'm holding a screaming baby for half an hour and getting stressed out. Starbound is the only game I play that lacks this simple functionality, so I haven't been playing it much in the past month."
starbound,39jlhp,Rahabic,3,Fri Jun 12 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"First point makes no sense, being in beta gives even more reason to ask devolopers to make some things."
starbound,39jlhp,Poiuy2010_2011,-59,Fri Jun 12 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"No, building a box around you doesn't count. It takes several seconds (not feasible when getting a call/work request) and can't be done at all in missions.   You don't have 3 seconds to build a box?  What kind of life are you leading where you need to leave literally in half a second?  I think you're either playing at work (and should do your job instead) or exaggerating."
starbound,39jlhp,ljbisbee,31,Fri Jun 12 05:12:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter how long it takes, the fact is it requires thought and careful, specific placement of blocks. When real life interferes with your gaming you don't always have the luxury of making sure you are safely protected by a box. That's why one-button pausing was invented like 15 years ago and every single player game since has had some form of it.   And you seem to have missed the second and more important part of my comment: you can't do it in missions. Unless there has been a major change in the past month or two, blocks can't be placed in missions at all, meaning you have to be lucky enough to be in a safe zone when real life calls. This was especially infuriating before the change that made missions not reset immediately upon death.   edit:    I think you're either playing at work (and should do your job instead) or exaggerating.     Not all jobs are created equal. My job has hours of downtime during which I am free to play games, as long as those games come with the understanding that I can leave them instantly. This is why I tend to play single-player sandbox type games, where I make my own fun at my own pace. Games like Terraria and Minecraft are perfect for this, but for whatever reason Starbound is missing this extremely basic function."

starbound,39nigz,distrox,2,Sat Jun 13 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"The current in-game timers are tricky to get the hang of, if we're talking about the stable version of the game (not the new ones in nightly). BUT everything you're talking about is totally possible and not hard at all, don't worry! For number 1, I did a similar thing with lights rather than doors. First put down a timer and a NOT gate for the timer, so they're blinking in opposite intervals. Then use a series of D-Latches, one for each door. You want the bottom input of the first D-Latch to be the output of the switch (or whatever turns on the system in the first place). The bottom input of the rest of the D-Latches should each come from the output of the previous D-Latch (in other words, you chain them together). The TOP inputs of each of the D-Latches should go like this: 1: Timer, 2: Not, 3: Timer, 4: Not, etc. etc. etc. Then you just wire up the outputs of those D-Latches to each of the doors! :) This will work both ways, turning the system on will open all of the doors one by one, turning it off will close them all one by one. If you want them to close one by one after a set duration or a button push, etc, you just need to flip that initial switch (because switches have inputs, you can use some sort of timer or a button or whatever you want!) Hope that helps, I'll try to take a look at your other questions a little later. :)"
starbound,39nigz,sbLora,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"It .. does work. I wish I could understand WHY it works but it sure does. There's one thing this won't let me accomplish though, and I would love it if I could ..  When I'm at the other side of the doors and close the doors, I want them to close in reverse order. This setup you suggested probably won't work for that? Or could I just build an identical setup but wire it differently so they close in reverse order, or is that doable at all?  Edit: Tried above, doesn't work. :c  Also is there a way to adjust the timing in which the doors close or open? I'm assuming with a 1-5 sec timers? But can those be chained together with 0.5s timer and somehow have each door take 2.5sec to open for ex?"
starbound,39nigz,sbLora,2,Sat Jun 13 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"So, it's actually pretty simple to understand how it works, once you understand how D-Latches work. I explain them in this video at about 4:30 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn_hXMaCXtM I'm gonna try to make another video soon about chaining them together.  Having the doors close the same way, but in reverse, is a bit more tricky. It's absolutely possible, but I've got to think about that one. The hard part is finding the solution that requires the least amount of logic gates and wires. (the more gates and wires you use, the more likely you are to slow down the game's framerate... not to mention the wall space they take up!) I'll see if I can come up with something for you!  As for chaining timers together, this is something I need to play around with some more. Again, there's almost definitely a way, but it's trickier. I know the new timers they're adding to the game are going to be incredibly easy to use and chain together. Lemme think on that as well. (If you can get away with using one of the existing timers, the 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5sec, it will be much easier for sure)  EDIT:  I read some of the rest of the discussion and saw that you're trying to use 2 hand scanners to open a door from either side, for a set duration (say 1 or 2 seconds) and then close the door? Let me know if I've got that right. If so, you can do that really easily with a simple circuit of 3 logic gates for each hand scanner. I show how to do that in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoh2W0kSLpw ...I added a switch because I wanted the door to stay open until I close it, but if you just want the door to open for 1 or 2 seconds it's even easier: Just leave off the switch and connect both outputs to the door's input. Basically it goes like this:  Hand scanner #1 output -> XOR input 1  Timer output -> XOR input 2  XOR output -> Timer input  XOR output -> NOT input  NOT output -> Door input  Repeat entire setup with hand scanner #2 (using another set of XOR, timer, & NOT gates)"
starbound,39nigz,sbLora,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:10:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed help you've given so far. I'll take a look at the door thing tomorrow probably and see how that goes.  As for doors closing in reverse, after a lot of frustration and help from a friend (who doesn't even play Starbound or own it!), we got it working. The end result (http://i.imgur.com/ItDSGdV.jpg if you're interested) is a mess wiring wise but it does work exactly the way I wanted. I'll take a look at the D-Latch explanation later to understand how they work but I doubt that'll explain me how this whole thing works, as I can't understand the contraptions on the left and their purpose.  Even though it's done it kinda feels bad I don't even understand what '' I '' have built as it'll be hard to replicate this in other situations if I don't know what I'm doing :c  Oh and for framerate issues, I haven't noticed anything, maybe a slight decrease if I'm holding the wiring tool with all that disco-light shit going on? Wallspace isn't a problem as the wiring room will be a separate area from the base anyway.. Only wiring it is annoying as it requires a loooooooot of walking :P. As you might see from the image .. yes, there was 17 doors + various switches and lights to wire that contraption into."
starbound,39nigz,sbLora,2,Sun Jun 14 12:47:38 2015 UTC,"Wow! That is a lot! Nicely done though, looks very organized. Different folks have different preferences about ""OR"" gates, as they're kind of redundant (you could always just run the two inputs of the OR gate directly to wherever you're sending the output) but I know they help keep things less cluttered.  Hopefully this will help with understanding the D-Latches: They're the only logic gate in the game that has two inputs with different functions. (an AND gate, for instance, doesn't care which input you have on top and which on bottom, unless you're running multiple wires to the same input that is...) They work like this:  The BOTTOM input of the D-Latch is -the- input. And the input gets RECORDED if the TOP input is ON. If the top input is OFF, then it doesn't matter what you do with the bottom, it stays in whatever state it was before. So what you're doing by chaining them together and using the timer & not gate, basically, is you're recording the input for each one when the timer is lit up, or for the next one in the row, when the timer's NOT gate is lit up, and so on. That input starts out as OFF, but when the first switch gets flipped, the first D-Latch turns ON. Now the input going to the second D-Latch is hot, so when its timer is ready it turns on! This sends an hot input to the next D-Latch, but again, it can only ""record"" this input when its timer is on. So it gradually makes its way down the line through all of the D-Latches. Would love to know how you got it to work in reverse if you figure it out well enough to explain it! :)"
starbound,39nigz,Varixai,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"Well there's 17 doors but there's 34 latches, so the other set of 17 is wired in a reverse order to the doors to make them close in reverse. The '' contraptions '' on the left (two of them) have something to do with the switches so that when I open the doors, the 2nd switch will go down, the original switch will go bk up, and then the 2nd switch can be used to close the doors in reverse.  I asked my friend and he insisted that the OR gates are necessary for this whole thing to work in reverse, yet you said they're redundant. I can't really tell as might be obvious ..  Frankly, I have no idea HOW it works, but you probably can tell just by looking at the image.  I'll get onto the door thing later today and report back if I run into any problems. It sounds simple enough, though.  Quickie for now though: Is that a mod or item in game? How do you have a display screen with OFF / ON on it? I want that :c. Also the screens with numbers etc.  .. And after watching that video I just realized and remembered something I've wanted for a while now.. When using hand scanners to open a door, is it possible to wire it so that the hand scanner goes back '' off '' after a set duration? I don't really like how when you use it it stays lit up for forever. It'd be perfect for the door thing I'll try building later."
starbound,39nigz,Varixai,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:10:08 2015 UTC,"So, the signs you're talking about were made at the Sign Shop in the Outpust. I just made them say OFF and ON (you have to draw the letters by hand) and selected the ""wired"" option. There's a cool guide about them here: http://starbounder.org/Guide:Animated_Signs  OR gates are always redundant. They can be helpful to make things cleaner / neater, but they're not necessary ever. Here's how an OR gate works:  When input 1 or input 2 is high (on), the output is high (on).  Well, in Starbound, you can connect as many outputs to one input (or as many inputs to one output) as you want. So we could do the same thing without the OR gate.  Example:  When Switch ""A"" is ON, or when Switch ""B"" is ON, open Door ""C"".  You could wire Switch A and Switch B to an OR gate, or you could just wire them BOTH to Door C. Either way, it does the same thing.  AND gates, XOR gates, NOT gates, Timers, D-Latches, these all have important functions. The OR gate is the only one that is just there to keep things neat and tidy. It's always completely redundant though.  Also, SADLY, hand scanners don't have an input, so with the setup I described earlier, they will stay on until you turn them off. The circuit I show in the video basically makes them act like a button (and it doesn't matter whether the scanner is on or off, the circuit doesn't care anymore). If you want, you can make the door only open when the hand scanner goes from OFF -> ON, using another trick I show in that video, but then you have to turn it ON -> OFF every time as well (this won't affect the door, but it's a little annoying to push the hand scanner twice)."
starbound,39nigz,SeaJayCJ,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:11:20 2015 UTC,Yes the sensors and pressure plates can both be linked to doors. Just link the red from the sensors to the purple on the door.  Have you checked out the basic and advanced wiring guides? It should answer all of your questions.  http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/guide-basic-wiring-guide.59852  (the advanced is linked to from that guide)
starbound,39nigz,SeaJayCJ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"You don't understand the question.  If I link a Sensor's red dot a Door's blue dot, the door will stay open when in the proximity of the sensor, and closed otherwise.  What I want is a way for the door to close behind me without interacting with any kind of switch. OPENING the door must still be done with a switch. You can't hook up a pressure plate or such to the closing mechanism of the door to make it so that the only thing the pressure plate does is close the door and nothing more. Not normally anyway .. Hence the question.  That advanced guide is so complicated that I can't even try to begin to understand it. I'm pretty sure if what I want to do with the doors opening in a sequence is possible, someone could help me and write up a simplistic, and noob friendly guide."

Does the combat change qualify as 0.1 or is it 0.01 as well? And then as they keep updating they'll get closer and closer to 1.0 and people will get more and more anxious and hopeful or pressuring as it gets closer to 1.0.

He shouldnt know what came before or after each other or the amount of updates. Also people mostly has anticipation and hopes from version numbers due to its simplification like Tearria 1.1, 1.2, and soon 1.3 (im hyped)  If you want to know how software versioning numbering and naming works, here you go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning Essentially applying versioning digits is much different than normal digits in decimals. If a patch is at 1.9 needs a bugfix, it'll probably change to 1.9.1. And if you want to update it from 2.9, it would be 2.10 (instead of 3.0). You can look at Minecrafts or League of Legends example of version numbers or anywhere else.   So lets say Starbounds at 0.9, it can become to 0.10 or all the way to 0.100. To not get people's hopes up for anticipation of 1.0, they'll their site and social media to clarify that it aint done yet  Starbound doesn't have to follow these rules and can even apply both like for e.g., Starbound v. 3.10.2 Beta: The Unambiguous Giraffe.   Finally it is the developers job to maintain healthy anticipation and expectations over their games (which ChuckleFish is not known well for). If a game is announced for a soon to be expected releasedate and fails to comply, its their fault. If they do release it on time but is rushed and incomplete, devs fault again."
starbound,39nu9b,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:40:52 2015 UTC,"Software versioning:       Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of electronic information, whether or not this information is computer software.

starbound,39nu9b,CrashmanX,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:40:59 2015 UTC,"Numbers obviously for less ambiguity.   Clearly, they want ambiguity. Because they don't have a set version they feel they're onto. They're trying to prevent ""OH MY GOD IT'S SO CLOSE TO 1.0!"" and shit for good reason. Because 90% of the people on this subreddit couldn't handle that.   And, like i said, helps keep stuff on track.   I'm pretty sure they have their own internal number for keeping on track.   Also people mostly has anticipation and hopes from version numbers due to its simplification like Tearria 1.1, 1.2, and soon 1.3 (im hyped)   This is exactly the issue SB is trying to avoid pre-release though. If SB were at version 0.015 right now, people would feel 1.0 is so far off it's not even a pipe dream. Conversely if it were at 0.5 people would get the idea in their heads that we're halfway there.    And if you want to update it from 2.9, it would be 2.10 (instead of 3.0). You can look at Minecrafts or League of Legends example of version numbers or anywhere else.   Leauge uses a X.X.X system however. Minecraft does the same now. A X.XX system only makes sense if you do it from the beginning. It doesn't go 2.9 to 2.10 because that's not how decimals work. You've regressed at that point in-fact and are now back at 2.1. 2.09 to 2.10 makes sense though as you've gone up one.   Finally it is the developers job to maintain healthy anticipation and expectations over their games (which ChuckleFish is not known well for).   So let's throw a different system into the mix! I'm sure that'll fix it! Except... no. It won't. As far as anticipation, they don't need to keep up any anticipation right now, the game is in it's infancy and testing stages still (for good reason). When it gets closer to 1.0 then they can worry about anticipation and making you quiver.   If a game is announced for a soon to be expected releasedate and fails to comply, its their fault. If they do release it on time but is rushed and incomplete, devs fault again.   SB failed at #1, though they only gave time frames not release dates and kept pushing it back like crazy. So do you REALLY want to see them go to a number system where they can abuse that again? Personally, I don't."

starbound,39fv7q,docalypse,-1,Fri Jun 12 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"not a good design imho.   this is a trap that you basically need to know about before hand to survive. to fix would need a better visual que to go into that room faster.  Having a light, light up on the inside of the room would help. or just using a touchpad thats lit.  so someone coming across this room for the first time, will see that ACTIVE control panel, and know to move towards it. with the lava telling them to do so, quickly.  Another possible issue is lava getting trapped in the room with you.  Id like to see a drain or something to make sure if you do get the doors closed, you are more likely to live, and not get trapped INSIDE with lava that won't drain.  Having the room being raised up a block or two might help with this.  again, both issues.  gives you another moment to see the lava is going to rise and kill you before it starts filling that room.  Again, directing you TO the room, which is raised off the floor.   And helps ensure the lava doesn't beat you to the room, and get trapped in there with you."
starbound,39fv7q,Tsuruda,5,Thu Jun 11 16:39:16 2015 UTC,These things make the challenge room less of a challenge and I think that that defeats the purpose...

starbound,39fv7q,NeonNina,-1,Fri Jun 12 09:00:42 2015 UTC,Traps should be understandable within the time allotted to solve them. A killbox is REAL easy to create.  A trap or puzzle is much harder on the creator to design something solvable with wit and ingenuity.

Here's a quick comparison between my 7200RPM HDD and my SSD. You'll notice the HDD is much, much slower when reading small chunks around 4kb in size, and especially slower when there's so many of them in a row."
starbound,39eukr,Fransesca,25,Thu Jun 11 08:17:44 2015 UTC,"In order to make it run faster (and decrease the amount of reads), several other factors must be taken in account:   all .png files of Starbound must be cleaned of Photoshop's junk metadata (it takes up to 99% of their size. No, I am not kidding) - this will shave off around 100-150 Mb off the pak file. all .wav files must be compressed to OGG Vorbis (music and several sound effects are already stored in them) - this will shave off another 100-150 Mb without any noticeable sound quality loss (since OGG is far superior than MP3 and capable of reproduction of 18 kHz data without audible artifacts even at ~128-160 kbps bitrate). Funny to note, most of Starbound's wave files were 128kbps MP3s in the past (possibly they were decompressed because CF ran into problem with licensing MP3 compression from Fraunhofer before its patent eventually expired), judging from their spectrogram: http://i.imgur.com/hM7cEqX.png all .json dungeon files must be converted to classic .png + .dungeon combos. This is the real problem with bloat ever since the dev team adopted the Tiled fork, because the generated .json files are outright monstrous. For example, if you'll try to compress monolith.json into ZIP archive, its size will drop from 7 Megabytes to 8 Kilobytes (same would happen if archive format used zlib compression for them). This happens because instead of storing tile map as pixels they store it as textual representations of integer values, which take not 4 bytes (like ARGB), but up to 10 symbols and not compressed any further. And yes, this will shave off another 100-150 Mb. starter planet lookup mechanism must be either rewritten from scratch or slightly altered, so instead of looking up for the ""Garden"" world the game would look for ""Gentle Star"" type instead (which always spawns Garden world) and ignore the world's size (right now it searches for ""small"" planet, but these are very rare, which causes the game to ""freeze"" for 5-15 minutes on slow machines at first-time universe generation run). Just by changing the lookup values to ""Forest"" world of any size (yet kept the ""Garden"" and ""Desert"" in conditions) I've managed to make the game run first-time generation for least than 2 minutes."
starbound,39eukr,KungFuHamster,5,Thu Jun 11 08:44:44 2015 UTC,"These are all great points, and I applaud your diligence and effort to make this an issue.  When you're an ""early release"" game, you don't consider file size optimization -- but when you're ""early release"" for a couple years and one of the top Steam games for an extended period, it's time to maybe start thinking differently.  Years ago, I assisted with the establishment and operation of a popular Everquest map site. The maps were text files, created by running around in the game and using in-game buttons to draw lines, etc. The maps were often very inefficient, using excessive significant digits when recording points, containing lots of redundant lines, etc. For example, one line could be something like:  L 54, -1005.3457, 0.7556, 67.2343, -992.2341, 0, 153, 153, 153   I made the suggestion to automatically drop all of the decimals and then run an optimizer on the maps. As well as a flat reduction in the size of each line, redundant lines were removed with the optimizer, which helped client performance, reduced file sizes across the site, and dramatically reduced the bandwidth requirements for the site."

I understand that Starbound is still early-access, but when I want to play a game, I don't want to have time to mix myself some iced tea and drink half of it while the game is still loading. TF2 loads faster than Starbound. (But I guess that's different. No giant universe/world files or anything like that.)"

starbound,39eukr,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:34:21 2015 UTC,You have money for cheese but not bread?
starbound,39eukr,TanzNukeTerror,2,Thu Jun 11 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"When I went shopping at the beginning of the month, I still had half a bread loaf left. I decided that instead of oatmeal and sandwiches all month, I'd go for hot meals like perogies, pasta, rice, vegetables and ground beef, etc. I got cheese to put on top, since I didn't get any milk either. But the half-loaf ran out fairly quickly, since I was having one slice every supper."
starbound,39eukr,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"I feel ya man, gotta get that hot stuff. Never forget the awesomeness of the potato when shopping, its better than bread in my opinion."

starbound,39eukr,lazarus78,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, Starbound starts in 5-10 seconds from the RAM drive or when cached by OS. This would be around 10-15 seconds from standard HDD if the above-mentioned optimizations would be applied."

starbound,39eukr,Thainen,0,Fri Jun 12 20:15:09 2015 UTC,"MrChow   Ah, so the guy who hates the devs of Starbound and consciously attempts to piss them off now is talking about how to optimize Starbound? You must forgive me if I take this with a salt shaker."
starbound,39eukr,Mackinz,5,Fri Jun 12 01:43:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the numbers he cites for the size reductions, but all the optimizations he lists make perfect sense to me."

starbound,39eukr,Mackinz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, he's just another hater who maintains a global conversion mod simply to piss off the devs. What could he possibly know about optimization?"
starbound,39eukr,Synaps4,0,Thu Jun 25 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"Your sarcasm is dripping, but I believe I did mention kyren's response to MrChow and I trust kyren more than MrChow since she works on the actual framework of Starbound. She partially confirmed most of MrChow's criticisms and already has optimized PNGs, so I have enough evidence to support the conclusion that MrChow was not incorrect with his statements.  However, as long as he has a mod called ""ChokeLeFish"", attacks Starbounds developers for every small change he does not like, and rags on them whenever possible, he is still a ""hater"". ""Global conversion"" or not, ChokeLeFish is a mod inspired by hatred of the developers of Starbound... why else would its motif be a dead Chucklefish mascot?  That's why I don't use it."
starbound,39eukr,Sir_Tiffy,0,Thu Jun 25 17:39:02 2015 UTC,"So the bottom line, MrChow is right =) Which kind of makes the question of whether he talks like a jerk completely irrelevant."
starbound,39eukr,SkyAxis,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, as this topic was done being discussed nearly two weeks ago, you didn't have to point any of this out because I'm not an idiot. I wasn't dismissing MrChow because he's a jerk, I was just not jumping to a conclusion in a positive or negative direction because of his known, intentional antagonism of Chucklefish, and it turned out he was mostly correct because kyren agreed with him so I accept that.  But he's still a jerk."
starbound,39eukr,auxiliary-character,0,Thu Jun 25 18:09:45 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of this. Why does he hate the devs of Starbound?
starbound,39eukr,robodendron,0,Tue Jun 23 04:50:16 2015 UTC,"For many reasons, apparently. It's easily inferred from his mod, ChokeLeFish (an oh-so-clever pun on Chucklefish... did you see the main image for that mod? It's a dead Chucklefish being fished out of water) that he does not like the direction the game is going in, so he's made several reversions to things that were in the Koalas (though he likes to stress ""I've done more than reversions""... which may be true, but it's not really good content IMO and the main draws are the reversions). Further discussions with Chucklefish developers have demonstrated that he talks a lot of shit to them, and particularly targeted metadept for the change to through-walls interaction while throwing a hissy fit.  Overall, I just consider him another of the ""nostalgia whores"" in Starbound (people who have long since forgotten what it was like playing the Koalas and don't want Chucklefish to change anything from that...)."

starbound,39dcpi,Varixai,6,Thu Jun 11 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"That seems a bit odd, considering that colonies have been in the works for the past month or so while the updated combat has been in development since at least the beginning of 2015. Either way, it's cool to see that Chucklefish is really taking off and getting more stuff done."
starbound,39dcpi,V8_Ninja,39,Thu Jun 11 04:43:25 2015 UTC,From a programmer point of view the combat update is a much bigger job. Were finally getting round to enabling the engine functionality we require to build really interesting and unique combat content.   Where previously the engine only allowed us to change the projectile the gun or sword was producing and all gameplay variety had to be derived from projectile variety. We can now do ridiculous things like this test weapon   http://gfycat.com/HandsomeCompassionateGerenuk

starbound,39dcpi,V8_Ninja,3,Thu Jun 11 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"As an programmer myself I probably should have realized that working on something new from the ground up is much easier than adding complexity to something that was already made. I guess sleep deprivation makes everybody a bit dumber.  Also, holy shit that new weapon is amazing.

starbound,39dcpi,Luminous_Fantasy,5,Thu Jun 11 00:31:18 2015 UTC,@Tiyuri:   2015-06-11 00:03:58 UTC  We've got devs producing the colony and combat update simultaneously. Colonies are ahead at the moment. Could end up being released first     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
starbound,39fkox,RMuldoun,9,Thu Jun 11 11:39:59 2015 UTC,"Healthire has been implementing NPC to NPC interactions alongside colonies. He has already laid the groundwork for a lot of awesome stuff.  Very soon NPCs will:   discuss things with each other have shared goals (stuff they work on in groups) that they choose themselves have a range of emotional states similar to ship pets (but more extensive) Much more that I'm forgetting this morning   Combine this with the wide range of tenants that will be available and, at the very least, colonies will be living and breathing. Tiy has indicated that they have some larger plans for colonies as well, including raids on your colonies.  So far everybody seems to love all of the colony stuff coming, and personally I agree with them. It is a pretty huge addition that makes the world feel more alive. I can't wait."
starbound,39fkox,Varixai,9,Thu Jun 11 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"I say don't worry about it. If in the short run we get a system that only lets us host NPCs for money, that's still an improvement over the current state. Sure, it's shallow, but shallow interactions are something that can be built upon, and I think Chucklefish would like to build on it.   Even if it never improves to the lofty heights you describe, it's still another sandbox system for Starbound—putting tools in the hands of players to build and create—and that's valuable on its own."
starbound,39fkox,nihiltres,3,Thu Jun 11 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"It's important to keep in mind, too, that whatever Chucklefish doesn't implement, modders can step in to fill the gaps."
starbound,39fkox,I_give_karma_to_men,6,Thu Jun 11 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"honestly this is such a terrible perspective on game development. Its the developers responsibility to deliver a fleshed out and fun product, not the modders."
starbound,39fkox,Squiddapult,6,Thu Jun 11 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, but at least whenever I make this statement, I mean it from the perspective that while the developers have one game in mind, a player may have wished for a different implementation. In the case that a complete, fleshed out game doesn't fulfill their wants, the fact that the game is so easily moddable becomes a huge boon for all parties involved.   It's not like they're going to push out a haphazard game. Mods just allow for that breathing room for those who want a personalized gameplay."
starbound,39fkox,yulevanlustria,4,Thu Jun 11 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"That's true, but it is not the devs' responsibility to explore every single possible avenue of every single game mechanic. I'm not saying the devs should slack off and just implement a bare bones version of colonization. What I'm saying is, that there will certainly be things the devs don't even think of implementing or that just aren't part of the direction they want to take the game that modders will be able to build on."
starbound,39fkox,I_give_karma_to_men,3,Thu Jun 11 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"We just got colonies. In fact, we don't even have them yet (except for you Nightly folks). It is literally a brand new feature. Just... keep that in mind."
starbound,39fkox,sbLora,2,Thu Jun 11 14:34:11 2015 UTC,Honesty I think   where we're more or less exploiting NPC's for various amounts of money.   would be a fun start. :)

starbound,39ae2o,quiqksilver,29,Wed Jun 10 12:04:58 2015 UTC,"So with the new weather mechanics in the nightly I found a way to create an automatic, AFK, infinite sand generator. I know sand isn’t that valuable but it can be smelted into glass which has a lot of uses. This design in particular generates about 48 sand per minute, or roughly 2,800 an hour. If you want to learn more about this mechanic I have a video for those interested. I’m also pretty sure this design can be improved on to increase the yield.  In the future I plan on making a multipurpose AFK farm incorporating this design. Most likely consisting of this sand generator concept with crop/tree farms below and sentry guns mounted near the top to collect mob drops with the sand.  Oh, almost forgot. I also found a silly way to make an infinite slime generator(yes, I’m aware it’s terribly inefficient, but I wanted to show it anyways lol)   http://gfycat.com/NextCorruptEuropeanpolecat"
starbound,39ae2o,nerfviking,9,Wed Jun 10 12:05:14 2015 UTC,"How long did it take you to build that contraption?  If you had spent that entire time mining sand with a fully upgraded matter doodad, how much sand would you have mined?  How many hours, then, would you have to spend AFK in your sand generator to make up that amount of time?  Sorry, that's the annoying pedant in me speaking.  This is a cool project, and sometimes it's fun to do something so you can say you did it. :)"
starbound,39ae2o,SupaSlide,13,Wed Jun 10 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"Well like I said, it's not really meant to out-speed the MM for mining sand lol it's designed for AFK farming.

[Edit]  You down vote for what?  I'm extremely excited about this game, I'm a backer from 2013-04-30.  But if I share any worry or yearning you downvote.  Willing to share why you downvote?  Makes me question the character of the reddit Starbound community a bit.  If you are confused about the quoted words... software is something that is almost never finished now.  The internet makes it very easy for developers to continually polish and shape their product after release, if they so choose.  Even the term ""release"" is malleable now, thus the use of quotes.  This was not the case back in the day when you had to buy software on a physical medium.  The internet was still new and speeds were extremely slow, which made patching/updating more difficult and expensive for the developer."

The scope of the game and its possibilities are too vast to ever allow a satisfying finished product. People will just keep begging for more, ""add this, tweak that, there should be those in the game, yadda yadda"". And I kinda like it, looking forward to the ""new new"" things going on in an ever evolving game.

This aspect is exciting and ""dangerous"" at the same time. =)  I hope this doesn't prevent at least a cutoff point where there is a specific release.  It can be difficult to hold off on awesome features/ideas but can be necessary at times to settle on concrete release.  Still looking forward to release, whatever that may entail when it happens.   Maybe people are way too sensitive about criticism nowadays, be it to themselves or the things they like.    Could be.  It is easy to lose perspective when there is a lot of zeal, hype, or passion.

starbound,39bh7h,irongamer,2,Wed Jun 10 23:08:17 2015 UTC,"Well, that all said, the dev seem intent on releasing a finished game game as long as all the core mechanics are in place (pets, satisfying combat, at least 3 complete and fully working progression paths). From then they'll support the game with additional content for at least 1 year. (I saw this stated by a dev somewhere, don't remember where)  With a finished core game, mods will stop suffering from compatibilty issues that stem from the bigger and more common pre-release updates, so we'll have a plethora of content to play with.  As long as they don't rush things and progress as steadily as they have in the past year, my mind will be at peace knowing the end product will be awesome."

Will there be planet with irregular day/night cycle, permanent pitch black, long sunset/dawn, or simply desertic eternal day (I know some of these geatures are in mods like frackinuniverse). Do they plan to change radically the size depending on the class of each star, displayed in the sky ? Why not add some exotic star as neutron star, or black holes, to feel even more scifi... I cant blame them for taking there time to polish the the game, I wouldnt like to play a game unfinished, even if it takes another year.

starbound,39eo2t,Nidmorr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"Have you guys experienced the new Desert/Arid/Deadplanet sandstorm weather effect? It puts an incredibly annoying slow on your that makes exploring these planets nigh on impossible. In fact the slow is so strong that if you also happen to have the oil status effect it almost roots you in place.  It also seems to never stop and is annoying af. I think making weather effects harmful is a neat idea and it really incentivizes hiding and going underground. But they need to be a rarity rather than the norm.   Also what's your opinion on the manipulator module and the other thing? The tech thingy is pretty useless at the moment and the manipulator is a neat idea, not sure how they plan on expanding on it though."
starbound,39eo2t,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, they haven't balanced the distribution of the Matter Manipulator modules, so they're probably going to be disproportionately difficult to find.  However, my opinion on the matter is that it's a silly idea. It does give incentive to go exploring, but it feels forced. (Like having to travel to a desert planet just so you can have proper glass windows in your starter house.) ""Oop. Can't get liquid collection unless you find all these pieces."" It seems like those old games with the puzzles you never like doing, but are required for progression. I'd like to be able to upgrade my Matter Manipulator over time as my tech advances. Maybe unlock upgrades with a certain crafting station you'd be making anyway. (But still require ores and tech or whatever to craft it.) This makes more sense to me."

The prospect of hunting for semi-rare chests underground and then having a chance to find 1 of the 5 modules seems like a waste of time.  Having a minimum amount on the surface of your starting planet as an incentive to explore sounds reasonable and prevents excess grind.

Similarly, I would love to be able to capture fish and birds in capture pods. (And also capture pods without the 'pet' behavior -- I just want to transplant monsters to other planets). Same with bugs, and the various critters they've been adding. Basically, if it's living, I want to be able to steal it and transport it to another planet. Huge bonus points if there's a system that allows transplanted species to go ""native"" and start spawning in their new home.  2) Weapon knockback mechanic. (Doesn't have to be all weapons, but would add a lot of depth to combat).  3) Craftable shields!

A lot of the randomness and exploration we were promised is faux-random, suffering from the Syndrome problem of ""If everything is randomized, nothing is"", and the quests are basically needless fetchquests. I'm not saying that the stage the game is at now is bad but it is, in my opinion, still quite some ways from a proper release.  Still, I am subscribed to this subreddit for a reason."

starbound,39ac81,justbeast,2,Wed Jun 10 13:48:54 2015 UTC,"The level of randomness in the game is really boring right now. You go to a planet that has roughly similar types of biomes every time complete with one peaceful, one aggressive and one flying surface mob and several aggressive underground ones. If you're lucky the world also contains some procedurally generated dungeons and/or settlements. The weapons you find are either melee weapons which sometimes do elemental damage or fling projectiles every swing, or projectile weapons which shoot a specific type of projectile selected from a list. Shields are all just shields of varying strength. The gear all have a [WORD WORD] name and their strength is determined by the level of the world you are on.  In comparison Terraria (since it is the most obvious comparison) has a smaller selection of monsters and weapons but since every single one of them is made by a human they tend to have more interesting mechanics as a result.  It's largely the caveat of procedural content generation. Things made by a human are naturally going to be more creative than something created by randomly mishmashing things together. Likewise, unique things stand out more when there aren't a trillion similar options available. A rocket launcher loses its uniqueness and becomes just another rocket launcher when there are literally thousands of them out there."

We could just find swords with 'leap attack' or 'x special move' meaning they're still not that diverse, but it's a start."

starbound,39ac81,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"It's largely the caveat of procedural content generation.    The last major title that comes to mind that had very similar issues was Spore.  Dang, the scope of the game had insane potential but in the end that was basically its downfall long term.  I love me some random generation, especially maps, but it can all look the same very quickly if leaned on too much.  The funny thing about humans is we love discovery and finding new things, but we also remember very specific events, places, or things.  The randomness can feed some of the desire for discovery but often at the loss of creating a memorable event or place as it all begins to feel the same.  It is rather tricky to balance imho.  Once the main story line is in place it may help thread some of the randomness into a more cohesive memorable experience.  The boss encounters already do this in a way."
starbound,39ac81,irongamer,0,Wed Jun 10 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that the current situation is fairly boring.  Random or procedural generation is not the culprit, however. By itself, it is not to blame. It's not the randomness, it's how game designers use it -- witness the addictiveness and staying power of games like the Diablo series, or Nethack (from which Diablo took inspiration).   Here are the changes that I think would fix the problems with the current random generation setup.  1) Divorce the planet type from difficulty level. (Mods like Mysterious Stars, etc, already do this). This alone would make a huge difference. Currently, to look for highest tier weapons, you're stuck with running around Dead/Volcanic/Magma planets only - fairly boring.  2) Allow more weapon types to be crafted. Projectile weapons need to be crafted by all the races, at all tech levels (not just the highest two). Shields need to be craftable (oh my god, I hate the current shield situation). Other weapon types (grenade launchers, specifically) also need to be craftable, as they aren't, currently. This would partly address your point about unique/human-designed weapons.  3) Have more weapon traits, mechanics and behaviors, from which to randomly generate the weapons. (They're working on this in the current update). And adjust the rarity levels accordingly. I don't mind that there's thousands of rocket launchers (though sure, they could be rarer), as long as the ones that I find and like are sufficiently interesting and unique.  4) Increase the useful life of a particular weapon (meaning, allow the weapon to be upgraded and grow with the player, through the difficulty levels). This is actually being worked on, thank god! (In that the weapon damage will be tied to armor level, so you can stick with a weapon that you like through the updgrades).  By the way, games like Diablo which otherwise make excellent use of random generation, have a huge problem with this, cool legendary and unique gear becomes obsolete almost instantly, as you gain levels and move to other areas and find better stuff.  4.5) Allow upgrades/enchantments/custom mods (think of Diablo's gem or rune slots). Even with the extended life that's provided by tying weapon dmg to armor, it would be nice to be able to customize or upgrade a weapon that you found and liked.  6) Have more unique/legendary items in general. Not just the ones you craft, but ones gotten from quests etc. To complement the randomly generated ones."
starbound,39ac81,justbeast,3,Wed Jun 10 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"It's not the randomness, it's how game designers use it -- witness the addictiveness and staying power of games like the Diablo series, or Nethack (from which Diablo took inspiration).   Nethack is not truly random as far as I know. That is, its loot is not procedurally generated but rather an existing pool of items all with their potential BUC/rustproof/fireproof/attackbonus states. The core items themselves are always statistically identical however so if you find a longsword it will always be worth 15 zorkmids, made out of iron, and deals d12 damage. Interaction with everything is also heavily coded to allow things like dipping wands into potions.  Diablo and its item generation is addictive to some people I won't deny that but I'd rather have functionally interesting weapons rather than statistical ones lest we run into the problem of the game becoming one about comparing numbers. And like you said a game about gear that expires ten monsters down the road is not really fun.  That aside I do understand what you are getting at and by no means am I saying that procedural generation is wrong or inherently inferior per se, but rather that making it compare to handcrafted generation requires a lot of work and that I feel like the current system is lacking in that regard. As for your suggestions, I pretty much agree with all 6 of them.  Also, downvoted for critique? Really Reddit?"

But I think trees choose a random Z-index (or 'layer'), and sometimes happen to be on the same 'layer' as other decorative things like your glitch lamp post. The random Z-index helps the trees look more natural when grown, I guess.  I'll do some in-game testing to see how the behavior works, then I'll edit this post with my findings."

I'm trying with the normal trees from my home planet (The cone-shaped ones.) and so far, they haven't broken the lamp posts, they just appear behind them.  This has been my setup. I've been placing the lamp posts at one, two, three, and four tiles away from the saplings. All before the saplings grow. Every time, the trees have grown behind them. (Five trees each so far.) Every time, the leaves have been below the tops of the lamp posts. I even tried this setup, and the results were the same.  You can't place a lamp post when there's already a tree in the way, but it seems trees have no effect on lamp posts that you've placed.  Maybe /u/sbLora was messing around with a gun and accidentally broke the lamp post, but a tree happened to grow at the same time? I think I've essentially debunked my previous deduction as well."
starbound,399l2z,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"Tanz, you rock! Thanks for testing this! I guess my scenario didn't go how I thought. It's possible that the lamp post got knocked out by something else. (I dunno if water can displace them, but it does rain a lot on my planet). And the trees I've planted that didn't grow may have had unacceptable terrain beneath them... (trees seem to be picky about what you do with the terrain immediately around the trunk, and I don't just mean the 2 tiles below)  Thanks for testing this. I was blown away when the tree grew behind the lamp post, as I didn't know they could do this until yesterday!"
starbound,399l2z,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"Trees only count the two blocks below them, when growing. As far as I know, at least. I've run another test with blocks running up the sides, creating a roof, and putting them in a tank full of water. (Which may have been too small. Will expand and try again. Edit: Expanded design. And the result. Trees just don't give a shit, apparently. From this, I can deduce that all plants are in one category. So kelp can grow in water or out of it, and trees can grow under water. I hope this helped. c: ) Saplings that can't grow, won't just stay saplings. They'll try to be a tree, find something in the way, and will break. They won't drop saplings or wood when they do this, and since they tried to be a tree, the sapling will no longer stay placed.  Saplings are, so far, unaffected by rain water. Or background blocks."

Standard weapons can always be built and due to how weapon randomization works they often end up better than the chest ones.  On the other hand, having to choose between learning a new weapon or using a weaker one seems like a fun choice and any differentiation on the weapons is welcome imo. Right now they're all really bland and the actual weapon pool of the game is pitifully small. Only the sprites really change."

starbound,394d6c,Extramrdo,2,Tue Jun 9 14:43:30 2015 UTC,"Retired tree collector here! All trees overlap if you plant them.

When they grow up, only the space above (and directly adjacent to if the tree requires) is checked. If there's sufficient room above when the sapling hatches: new tree! Else, sapling just vanishes.

You only have two choices:  1) Open the Starbound port in your router or modem. This is simplest, since it just allows people to type in your external IP and just connect.  2) Use a tunneling tool like Hamachi. This is slightly more involved (in that people have to download & install Hamachi clients, etc).

Most of the time, the Nightly build is unplayable without Admin mode. (And even when it's playable, most of the work-in-progress goodies, like the new missions, are not accessible by default in the game. You have to use admin commands to spawn the requisite items, or to teleport, etc).  Apologies if this is self-evident, I only mention it because I didn't know, back when I tried out nightly."

starbound,39750k,DericFromWashington,3,Tue Jun 9 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, in terms of lore i would love to find more occupied worlds, maybe a you beam down to a planet and are dropped into the middle of an apex city full of high rise building and laboratorys. or maybe you beam down to be dropped into the middle of a planet wide battle between the Florans and Hylotls with the ground blasted a part in some places and roaming squads of soldiers. it would add a lot more narrative to the worlds you visit. or hell maybe even have you encounter other ships while jumping from world to world. maybe as an apex deserter you get abducted by  apex bounty hunters. just small instances of narrative that would compliment the dungeons you find and the lore in the codex."
starbound,39750k,Ceptore,2,Wed Jun 10 01:03:00 2015 UTC,The quest and environment complaints can be summarized down to the fact that CF is still working on the underlying systems and trying to implement new additions engine wise to support more content. Not to mention questing won't get fully fleshed out till the game is nearing completion due to not wanting to focus on too much content that might need reworked if a major overhaul happens under the hood.   Basically anything dealing with world generation or environment factors both above ground and below is all down to the systems still a WIP. So it's barebones till they get it to a point where they get the foundation stable enough and working how they need before they can add tons of new content in the likes of quests and world generation.

It's just you kinda don't want to load a table full of heavy items if the legs aren't able to support the weight of what is to be added.  As it stands now, it's still in development and has alot of under the hood work to get finished before CF will be able to pump out content. Not saying your complaints are wrong or anything. Just that a few of them will be sorted out in due time."
starbound,39750k,duckmurderer,2,Tue Jun 9 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"On the lore, have you read through the codex? There's loads of lore in the game but it's rather disconnected from the gameplay in the current stable."
starbound,39750k,Artie-Choke,-3,Tue Jun 9 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"but many of the worlds within about 400 fuel points within my home constellation were almost completely empty on the surface.    That's how I see it as well.  Each planet has the bare minimum of life on it and no real reason to deal with them when you do find them.   but as it stands, it hurts to say that the quests are almost unbearable, especially when the semi-linear style of the game's progression relies on them so much.   This is how I feel about questing.  If you don't win the lottery and find good weapons, you're shit out of luck progressing past the bosses.  I was stuck at Dreadwing going nowhere until I just /admin'd my way past him.   This sounds cruel, especially since I feel the devs are working their asses off on SB, but I honestly don't think they know how to wrap their heads around a decent quest system, because what we have so far is just something I want to slog through to get past it all and get on with the game... but questing is supposed to be a big part of the game...."

starbound,3962u9,justbeast,3,Tue Jun 9 14:55:36 2015 UTC,"It gets updated with Nightly stuff manually, usually only a week or 2 before the Stable patch. It's basically a last bug check before Stable hits. So in general it comes at about the same pace as Stable updates.  Currently Unstable is the same as Stable. The next Unstable update is likely 3-4 weeks away, maybe a bit more.  The main difference between Nightly and Unstable is that on the Nightly almost all the new features are in mid-development states; you have to do special admin things to see or test them. Like the Colony stuff right now, there is no way to get a Colony Deed without admin commands. Before it hits Unstable the devs put in all the finishing touches that make everything playable normally."
starbound,3962u9,Varixai,3,Tue Jun 9 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That makes sense. (So basically, there isn't much benefits to playing on Unstable, except for that few weeks before the stable patch).  I do wish they'd make pushes to Unstable more often, with smaller feature releases rather than one big update, but what can ya do. :)"
starbound,392gzx,Wulf_Oman,15,Mon Jun 8 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"For those who haven't heard about or seen this feature yet: This is a new system on the Nightly that enables developers and modders to create these popup windows.  This screenshot is from the first mission (Lunar Base one), where SAIL talks you through the mission. Don't worry, it doesn't hand hold you, it just gives you a bit more information on what is happening.  When SAIL talks to you the message is towards the bottom left of your screen. However, the system also works for NPC dialogue right next to you in the world.  In the third mission (Floran Party/Hunt), you meet a Floran girl named Nuru. When she talks to you these dialogue popups appear right next to her, with a detailed portrait of her face in it, like how the SAIL face is there in the linked image here.  These already appear in a few spots other than missions as well. For example, the first time you visit one of the gates that lead to the Outpost and Ark SAIL talks to you about this discovery and what function it may have.    All of this may not seem like much, but when you are playing through these missions and going through the story these make a big difference. The world feels more alive and you feel more connected. I imagine it also greatly helps newer players.  You can see many more examples of this system in action in this forum thread if you want to."

starbound,394941,Acataeono,3,Tue Jun 9 03:44:13 2015 UTC,"No, there isn't really a list of how all the microdungeons look ingame. It's been on my to-do list, but is a very low priority.  There are too many in the assets to put on the wiki (about 160 unique structures). In the assets you can see the names and the PNG maps of them, but they don't look like they do ingame, not to the untrained eye anyways.  The related wiki page right now is this one btw: http://starbounder.org/Dungeons"

starbound,394941,Varixai,3,Tue Jun 9 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"Yea I made a big list of all the planets, mini-biomes, and dungeons.   Those are major dungeons though, which is a totally separate thing than the tiny microdungeons the OP here is talking about.  Microdungeons are the 1 or 2 room areas you usually find underground. (There are a couple surface ones though, like the houses with avians in them and the glitch houses with a wizard or lord.)"

starbound,393bfp,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:01:38 2015 UTC,Yeah  One issue I find with official wikis is they're blocked on most networks that block games - while wikia/some unofficial wikis are not for one reason or another.  Maybe that's why OP uses/is used to using the wrong one?
starbound,393bfp,_Abecedarius,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole wikia network really bugs me to be honest.

starbound,38yape,Tampashrew,4,Mon Jun 8 01:30:33 2015 UTC,Really now? Huh. That's freaking crazy.
starbound,38yape,Zachbot20,14,Mon Jun 8 02:00:36 2015 UTC,His room looked like this and he wrote special software to make all his 'bots' follow a single instruction. All because he didn't want to rely on strangers.
starbound,38yape,Dicethrower,2,Mon Jun 8 06:34:02 2015 UTC,Doesn't that take away from the entire point of raiding?
starbound,38yape,VoteRonaldRayGun,5,Mon Jun 8 09:56:33 2015 UTC,"No, the point of raiding is a (massive) multiplayer balanced experience as opposed to the imbalanced open world, with the keyword being balanced.     In the open world, any enemy you encounter can be fought in many ways. You can be fighting it yourself, with any class, combination, etc... or with everyone in the entire server, with every class combination imaginable. As a designer, how can you possibly find a fun balance knowing the wide range of scenarios? They can't, so they don't. They basically balance every enemy in such a way that you can sort of fight it by yourself on the expected level of the area. This whole thing one of the many fundamental flaws of the wow-style MMO and is known to either make an MMO way too easy or way too hard because the designers now expect you to fight monsters in a large group. Especially when you consider that valuable rare items need to be attached to this balance.   So they invented raids. By limiting the maximum number of players in an instance of the raid and setting a min/max level, the designer now has an idea of what kind strength the group in total has when traversing the instance. Now suddenly a fun balance can be made that isn't easily broken with more players."
starbound,38yape,Dicethrower,2,Mon Jun 8 11:21:47 2015 UTC,"Which proves my point again.  People play raids to play a multiplayer game, playing by yourself removes the entire 'fun' aspect."
starbound,38yape,VoteRonaldRayGun,7,Mon Jun 8 11:57:05 2015 UTC,"People play the game for many reasons, and enjoy it for many other reasons. Maybe that guy liked the satisfaction of completing raids all by himself."
starbound,38yape,tupper,3,Mon Jun 8 12:03:46 2015 UTC,"playing by yourself removes the entire 'fun' aspect.     That's very subjective. Also, if that was the sole reason, everyone would be playing MMOs that rely completely on player-player interaction, which almost none of the MMOs really are. It's all added as a feature, but not necessary. ex: I can reach max level in WoW all by myself."
starbound,38yape,Dicethrower,6,Mon Jun 8 13:40:27 2015 UTC,Look up multiboxing. It gets insane
starbound,38yape,iraknee,4,Mon Jun 8 02:09:28 2015 UTC,Macro'ing ie: not by himself because the computer was doing 3/4ths of the actions for him.
starbound,38yape,Solaratov,2,Mon Jun 8 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but multiboxing is a bit different in a situation like that where all characters are in the same area."

starbound,38yape,Hanes74,4,Mon Jun 8 03:04:38 2015 UTC,Roleplay. Having /this/ many characters to roleplay however would be very strenuous.
starbound,38yape,GoldParichutes,4,Mon Jun 8 03:31:10 2015 UTC,Can someone explain this to me? Is it just to have a bunch of characters playing at once or is there some other reason?
starbound,38yape,KlockoBL,5,Sun Jun 7 23:23:12 2015 UTC,"Normally, people multi-client with only two or three guys. I saw a post earlier this week showing off that he could do four and I decided ""Hey, I could do better"". Anything above three is usually just for musical instrument parts."

starbound,38xpi7,Zeblade,13,Sun Jun 7 19:01:41 2015 UTC,Lol that's funny! Am I the only one who prefers that ship to the new one? The current one feels really bland.
starbound,38xpi7,Ostrichgrif123,9,Sun Jun 7 21:38:54 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that that ship looks much better than the new one. Really shows the asian influences of the Hylotl better than the huge blue monstrosity they gave us now.
starbound,38xpi7,Lord_Mantis_Toboggan,2,Sun Jun 7 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't think the current blue one looks bad or anything, but that was one of the really cool aspects of the Hylotl was they had by far the coolest ships.   However, in Spirited Giraffe I'd have to say the Florans now have the coolest ship, especially now with the cool glass area at the top.  A close second would have to be the Novakid's ships, because who doesn't love space trains?"
starbound,38xpi7,rf32797,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:39:35 2015 UTC,"personally if it weren't for its shape I would say I like the Apex ship the most.

Similarly the shape of the Avian ship bothers me, but I like the color scheme and egyptian influences of the Avian as well."

starbound,38xpi7,owenkass,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:27:45 2015 UTC,Well said.
starbound,38xpi7,Ichthus95,2,Mon Jun 8 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"Personally I like the current ship. It looks really nice and sleek at all expansion levels, and it does a good job mixing the Japanese influences with the cyberpunk that's also an important aspect of the Hylotl. I prefer it to the giant flying Magikarp."
starbound,38xpi7,Starayo,2,Mon Jun 8 23:30:52 2015 UTC,I liked the idea of a giant flying fish turned into a spaceship as well. Perhaps Starbound or a texture pack will create a way to change ship skins.
starbound,38xpi7,WrethZ,5,Mon Jun 8 17:44:10 2015 UTC,Looks like how I decorated my floran ship.  For a disgusting fishface you had good taste.

The whole build is really intimidating / menacing yet ordered and practical like the USCM seems to be, I think it fits them even better than the bunker dungeon!

Would love to see more close-up screenshots or a video!"
starbound,38xuvx,sbLora,2,Sun Jun 7 19:52:33 2015 UTC,There's Tech-tunnels all around base. I can put logic gates there. Or people can stealth through them with morphball. Splinter Cell style.

He is probably asking because he saw people talking about it here. No need to be vague when all you had to do was add a few extra words to your post to make it clear what is going on.

starbound,38w52h,Yama951,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:37:53 2015 UTC,I went kinda overkill with this one.  50 floors.  Each floor has been fitted with a skyrail so that it's easier to harvest the crops.  This is part of a much larger base that goes beneath the sea.  I'll be posting a follow-up with all the other components of that base later on.
starbound,38w52h,God_of_Fun,2,Sun Jun 7 13:47:08 2015 UTC,I suggest using the harvestgun mod. Saves me time in farming and replanting.
starbound,38w52h,K_3_V_O,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:03:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen that.  It's a clever little mod.  Will have to scope it once I get all the other modules done."
starbound,38w52h,Mackinz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I really wish the crops went four by four throughout. You've got a whole lot of wheat but only two rows of other stuff. I'd like to see this again with more order and every space filled with a crop, but I'm a sucker for regularity."
starbound,38w52h,sayterdarkwynd,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"Sweet! Call me a noob, but how do they become watered? I'm pretty new to SB. :v"
starbound,38u3bp,rhaokja,91,Sat Jun 6 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"This is a very impressive  build.   The eye towards aesthetics is fantastic, and you've managed to carry it consistently throughout without it being even slightly repetitive. The pyramid theme is inspired and used to great effect, as is your really interesting, almost abstract use of glass, creating 'circuits' of windows instead of square patterns. If I have one complaint, it's that some of the stands of palm trees are a bit too dense, but that's a minor, personal nitpick.  Seriously, it's very rare that a build makes me gush. Well done. I hope angled bricks are implemented at some point (when I asked Tiy about it during the AMA, he said it was ""a really interesting idea, it's not planned at the moment"") so you won't have to fake those smooth lines with Lunar platforms and skyrails.  Again, very impressive. One of the best builds I've seen on this subreddit."
starbound,38u3bp,Professor_Retro,22,Sat Jun 6 21:39:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the glowing review! I agree the trees aren't quite right. I'm hoping to mix up the palms with some shorter variants if I can find them.    Angled bricks would have been really helpful in this build, although many of the elements I'm happiest with came from the restriction of not having them. Thank you again. :)"
starbound,38u3bp,Professor_Retro,9,Sat Jun 6 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Mixing up the tree heights would help a bit, though it was the density of them that I noticed (there are a few spots where you have them growing with almost no room between).  I do agree that the (current) limitations in Starbound were well-played in your build; the sky-rails dipping down in certain places (around columns, to hold banners, etc.) stands out especially. Using the Lunar Platforms to ""frame"" the glass in your arcade / bar area and the hospital is excellent as well.  Again, very nice work."
starbound,38u3bp,rw-blackbird,-1,Sat Jun 6 22:16:49 2015 UTC,"If angled bricks are so interesting to him, why not create them?  Certainly it wouldn't take more than five minutes to create the art, and then another few to add the objects into the database."

starbound,38u3bp,skabbo,3,Sun Jun 7 06:05:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, I do like building things. But I like building large monoliths and citadels, I detest building entire towns house by house. I'd rather have the ability to build a citadel and then autobuild a town across the planet.  The reason being is due to the way resources are gathered for buildings. It is INCREDIBLY time consuming and I feel that by the time we have light speed we'd also have methods of automatically mining planets for resources."

starbound,38u3bp,TheSolty,4,Sun Jun 7 00:11:41 2015 UTC,That is incredibly impressive. Did you sketch a draft of it beforehand or did you build as you went?
starbound,38u3bp,Varixai,2,Sun Jun 7 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I just started building. I had the general theme in mind, and the stylistic elements got refined as I went along. A few of the early structures went through rebuilds as a result."

Is there some sort of command to take huge screenshots or did you take a ton with F12 and stack them together in GIMP or something else? EDIT: Second question, what's the main block you're using?"
starbound,38u3bp,StarMerchant,5,Sun Jun 7 22:25:34 2015 UTC,I changed the zoom to 1x to get a larger screenshot and then stitched together about 12 shots in Photoshop. There was a little editing to make the transitions less jarring.    The bulk of the structure is soft brick. Hope that helps.

starbound,38u3bp,c_vic,2,Tue Jun 9 08:20:05 2015 UTC,You can run from one end to the other just holding a direction key. Each level of the farm is reachable with a normal jump which works for me in a high tech setting.

As for the plant locations, I think all of the Biome pages have the current plants on them. The plant pages just might not have the biome they drop in on their page. I'll check them various pages.  For now though, I added the plant drop locations to my big planet/biome/dungeon list. Including mini-biome plants."

Also, while we're on the topic, how do you get colony deeds in nightly, so that I would be able to buy seeds?"
starbound,38y1t5,Varixai,3,Sun Jun 7 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"They spawn in the default chest treasure pool, meaning any chest and monster at any tier has a small chance to drop it. (They compete against tons of weapons, armors, costumes, and other seeds)  You can spawn colony deeds on the nightly with /spawnitem colonydeed. I'm not sure if any of the merchants sell it, but there is a small chance you will get it as rent from tenants that give produce as rent.  You can see what objects tenants require to spawn and what rent they give on the Tenant wiki page."
starbound,38y1t5,Varixai,2,Sun Jun 7 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"Cool, thats really good to know.   So to confirm, at present the only way to get a colony deed is with /spawnitem, there are no legitimate means?"

starbound,38w71k,Nightcaste,3,Sun Jun 7 12:48:42 2015 UTC,"The issue is the way the old character files were stored, they could not be read by the new system.  Your old character files were still on your pc but the game doesn't know what they are anymore, so you can't load that character."
starbound,38wtus,PoppySquidJr,3,Sun Jun 7 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"It's up to you to decide what's alright and not alright to do. You bought the game, you can play it however you want.  That being said, I think there's absolutely nothing cheap about spawning in an unobtainable set for cosmetics."

starbound,38wtus,Wulf_Oman,2,Sun Jun 7 16:10:33 2015 UTC,There's no real problem with it. All the metallic sets and diamond armor are completely if not mostly cosmetic now so it would give you no real advantage at any point.  Besides you keep them as cosmetic anyway

starbound,38rdlz,Aggraxis,2,Sat Jun 6 04:59:35 2015 UTC,Thanks. It's just that I started getting really into the game and seeing lots of other people posting really makes me wanna build something cool and share it with the world too!

starbound,38tic6,niqotina,2,Sat Jun 6 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting that carrying around thousands of tons and thousands of cubic meters of building materials without so much as a backpack isn't already somehow compacted?    In my mind, the matter manipulator is full of a bunch of capsules which hold the matter. Things like blocks are stored more efficiently while equipment and furniture utilize different compression techniques, lest they be damaged.    And then you simply unplug the full cartridge and put it in a crate.    Oh.... that would be an interesting mod.... Take each of the pages of the matter manipulator and allow them to be stored (full) as a single item. You could upgrade the MM with additional pages and everything."
starbound,38tic6,efgi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"Well, there is something like that in the form of the 3d printer. It's not quite the same since you pay to scan an object and pay to print as much of that object as you can afford, and it doesn't allow duplication of blocks. But for furniture it works pretty well, especially combined with a refinery for turning ores into cash."
starbound,38tic6,half_dragon_dire,2,Sat Jun 6 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"This is for storage, not item manufacturing. While I suppose the 3D printer could be used as an expensive version of it, it can't do some items, so the comparison is fairly flawed.   To actually answer OP: Not as far as I'm aware of, but continued pestering could change that, especially considering how much storage most players seem to have."

starbound,38tcei,my-other-account-is,3,Sat Jun 6 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"Not very often, the next one is estimated to be about two months away. However, they have a nightly build you can opt into, which is very buggy but has the freshest stuff that the devs have been working on every night (whether they fully function or not, i.e. the selling mechanic atm) No, they managed to find a way to avoid that now on the non-nightly build of the game. However, this doesnt guarantee that future updates wont change planet generation,etc meaning you may want to start over to see the changes (Im pretty sure planets you havent visited yet will change with the update, so you can keep the ones you've explored in-tact and just fly elsewhere) Not as far as I'm aware, the updates themselves are usually long waits and I know this one 2 months from now won't be the final release one."
starbound,38tbde,God_of_Fun,3,Sat Jun 6 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Extra Zoom Levels Mod < This is the easiest way, it just gives you a ton of extra zoom levels in the ingame menu.    But you can also go into your Starbound folder, and in giraffe_storage is a ""starbound.config"" text file. The last line in that file is the zoom level. You can change that to 1 or even .5. The drawback is that you have to leave the game, set that, start the game.    1x zoom is what most big screenshots are taken at by the way. It is the farthest zoom that still renders every pixel correctly. Remember, you will likely get a decent amount of lag at this zoom, it won't be playable normally. You can go all the way down to around .5 if you want, but it will be extremely laggy and the edges of the screen won't be rendered anyways."

starbound,38tbde,Professor_Retro,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose it depends on how many you have to splice together; the ruined bridge was something like a dozen screen caps.  It's also something you should really learn to do yourself, for future builds. You don't need photoshop (though you can use the free version they offer), just an image-editing program that allows you to use Layers (such as Gimp)."

I allow myself to keep 1-2 melee weapons beyond my main and 2-3 guns (covering a range of firing speeds and useful bullet effects). Everything else gets tossed.  Blocks are my only weakness.

Either way, once its set up you only need to do it when you need pixels, no need to harvest over and over, that would definitely get dull.

starbound,38pt3i,Varixai,5,Sat Jun 6 05:55:42 2015 UTC,If you're inventory is filling up with pickaxes and drills then you aren't using them enough. And if you don't need them for anything then you don't need them in your inventory.  Before your matter manipulator is maxed there are a lot of pickaxes that are better than it. Once it is maxed out it is a lot better than pickaxes at gathering large quantities of things.  Drills are faster than the matter manipulator but mine a very small area. Therefore you want to use those if you only need to mine 1 or 2 blocks wide. (Like a 2 block shaft to the core of the planet)

I tried to salvage my starting world as well, since there's a nice little storage and supply base on it, but to no avail. Might be a challenge as well to keep anything properly in its place because I switched versions from OpenGL to OpenGL64 during the reboot.

starbound,38melt,Nematrec,3,Fri Jun 5 07:38:03 2015 UTC,I wish floods of water would knock the plants over.  That was an easy way to autoharvest in minecraft.
starbound,38melt,polimodern,3,Fri Jun 5 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"I'd be more useful if it just knocked the fruit off, having to replant everything would make it not worth it."
starbound,38melt,drew4232,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:20:42 2015 UTC,Can you harvest from a skyrail?
starbound,38melt,al3x094,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"I tried, it lagged so hard things didn't render and i was bounced in the other direction, but maybe I used too many accelerator rails or maybe my computer is underpowered. That said, it did harvest them, and it was kinda funny to watch the fruit catch up when I stopped. I will experiment with fewer accelerator rails in the future."
starbound,38melt,Mathus1979,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"Well, any autoharvester that is added will likely be just as laggy as doing it from a rail"
starbound,38melt,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:13:59 2015 UTC,If the autoharvester moved slower than me flying at full tilt along the rail I think it would work. The problem currently is that even walking at a normal pace and pressing E over and over doesn't get everything and holding E doesn't work. So if the autoharvester allowed you to hold E and a direction it would be vastly superior to the current tap E method. Especially if it moved even slightly faster than walking.

starbound,38melt,Vellbott,6,Fri Jun 5 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"So I built a roof over my 3000 unit planet and planted avesmingo seeds all across the top. It's kind of a drag to have to hit a direction and E over and over.  In light of recent mention of vehicles, something that I could ride that would allow me to simply hold a direction and E that traveled a little faster than walking would be fabulous. And if I could upgrade it to till dirt and plant seeds, even better.  For those of you who are interested here are some statistics  number of avesmingo plants: 1,500  avesmingo gathered in the process of acquiring enough seeds: 5,899  avesmingo gathered in one circuit: 2,119  seeds gathered in one circuit: 672  plant fiber gathered in one circuit: 1,297  time to complete one circuit: 6:30  wait until next harvest after completing harvest: 1 minute  pixels netted from one circuit: 65,333 (pixel value: mingo 28, seed 7, fibre 1)  Yields may vary, and the circuit does not include avesmingos below the roof (as seen in photo).  Also I think it's also worth mentioning that until they re-add a legit way to make avesmingo juice, the most profitable crop is grapes, because their juice sells for 40 pixels."
starbound,38melt,GregTheMad,2,Fri Jun 5 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"Can I please have some screenshots of this world, this farm sounds crazy. Also, I've always wanted to put a ""roof"" over an entire planet and add in a background to make the surface seem like everything is underground. Thought it would make a cool exploration. But man that would take forever."
starbound,38melt,GregTheMad,2,Fri Jun 5 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"The thing I really want to get is a gif of me walking the entire circuit, but I don't know how to do it for free on mac easily. I'll take some photos of interesting points on the walk right now, expect a reply with a link in a few."

starbound,38melt,Artie-Choke,2,Sat Jun 6 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"I hate to be a let down, but I did the circuit again, and screen shots are not that interesting, which is why I want the gif, because that would get the full effect. Even so, here's a pic of the mingo's above my humble home, during a pretty sunset.  To help you imagine, its a lush biome with a one block band of tilled soil spanning the entirety, with avesmingo's planted so as to have no wasted space. If you look at the picture and then imagine walking in a straight line for about four minutes while mingo after mingo plant goes by, you won't be missing anything. I would plant more floors, with teleporters between, but without something to easily harvest them its not worth the time."

starbound,38pcya,Varixai,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:45:39 2015 UTC,It's nice and all but when exactly does he mention visiting a butcher? I only see the word butcher associated with the title of the quest but that doesn't really imply he murdered a butcher.
starbound,38pcya,Tampashrew,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"Well, if you look at the title of the first one, it says ""Butcher, Baker, Widow Maker."" With you being the baker, as you're making a cake. The bounty hunter is then the widow maker, because he killed the husband of the now-grieving widow. So then the butcher would be the man he murdered, right?"
starbound,38pcya,DangerQuinn,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"The dude hands you a sword for the reward and a bag of ""meat"" later. I would think he's also the butcher."

starbound,38pcya,Zian64,4,Sat Jun 6 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"Your reply could mean that you are so disgusted by learning that you are an accomplice to murder that you feel you have hit the ""that's enough internet for me today"" point, thus getting up and going outside.  If that is the case, I agree! Nature will probably do wonders to clear your conscience after aiding a murderer.    However, your reply could also be a derogatory statement implying any of a large number of stereotypical things about me.    If it is the latter, to that I say: Meh.  I strive to be quick, thorough, and accurate almost everything I do. Just because this is a hobby outside of my profession does not mean my goals change.    In this particular case, my writing started out as a simple reply to the posts I quoted, which were in the Ark discussion thread. I do my best to know what I am talking about, so my research led me through the related wiki pages. As I wrote out my reply, starting from the first quest.. all the commentary just sort of flowed as it came to me, and before I knew it I practically had an essay on the topic.  So, because it was quite off topic anyways, I formatted it a little bit and threw it into its own thread. I figured some people on reddit might find it interesting as well, so I put up a link to it. (I mean hey, it's not another starter planet or FPS thread, it can't be that bad right?)  That post took me about 5 minutes to research and 15 minutes to write, not really a huge chunk of my day.  P.S. And yes, I realize that if you did mean what you said in a derogatory way, you could say the exact same thing about this reply. (my answer wouldn't change)"

There's not much more we can do to broadcast it :(  Unfortunately, the 1 thing it does not currently have is the top google result or the words ""Only Official Chucklefish Approved Community Supported Wiki"" in the title of the google result.

starbound,38pgst,Wulf_Oman,4,Fri Jun 5 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"No problem. Yea even the official wiki is entirely community driven. It has been supported almost single-handedly by /u/Katzeus.

With him doing a massive amount of the grunt work and me making or expanding a lot of the wiki-only pages like: The Ark / Commands /  Spawn NPC Command / Spawn Monster Command / Upcoming features / Tenants  Though Dunto recently made a bot that should help with a lot of the background data work.

starbound,38n8rz,Bobboy5,2,Fri Jun 5 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, use a shield in each hand and alternate between using left and right, since the cooldown period for a shield is per-shield, not global.  This way you're always blocking, and effectively invincible."

If something hits it, it will be a Perfect Block and the shield will take no ""damage."" By spamming the shields and forcing perfect blocks, you'll take ~0 damage."

starbound,38oegz,iRhuel,3,Fri Jun 5 15:33:04 2015 UTC,I thought the first boss was the crystal thingy?   Also that one kicked my ass so many times. Dreadwing by comparison was really easy...
starbound,38oegz,nerfviking,2,Fri Jun 5 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't had much of a problem with Dreadwing lately.  Just carry a stack of bandages, a gun, and a heavy melee weapon.  Shoot at him from the ground, try no to get hit by his projectiles, and when he slams the ground (and pauses for a few seconds), bash him with your melee weapon."

starbound,38oegz,Twad_feu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"Use a shield. Eat a good food for buffs. Carry bandages. Take out the small mobs whenver they show up, preferably from range as some can deal a ton of damage."
starbound,38oegz,ChaoticStupid,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, I played the unstable when dreadwing first came out as a mission boss and got completely wrecked. I trained and trained on it, and eventually beat it after foraging for the best gear, making the best foods as power-ups (I used so much coffee cake as a gunner for energy and health), and eventually beat it. I was so proud of myself, and proud of the developers for making a really good boss I actually felt accomplished for beating. Then, it was pushed to stable and made waay too easy. The hit points were cut by about half, attack patterns seem way more predictable now, and the only buff is they give the minion penguins more hit points. I don't even reorganize my hotbar when going into the fight as a new character anymore, nor do I restock anything, or feel challenged in any way. Was sad that they had nerfed the Shockhopper as well, you used to have to learn the attack patterns but now you just use high damage weapons like hammers or rocket launchers and it's over in under a minute. Hope that they are restored to their former glory, at least in a higher difficulty."
starbound,38oegz,sayterdarkwynd,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"No. Dreadwing is easy as hell if you use what you have learned from the quests up to that point. Food, bandages, shield, weapon, victory. If you go in unprepared, you will be butchered like a stuck pig. This is intended, from what I understand. However, eventually they intend to have progression be possible without boss fights (if what they have said is still accurate, at least) so those are are not Boss Fans can get to the next tier without a grueling ordeal later on in development. Granted, that would be later and not right now so it does you no good...but there you have it."
starbound,38oegz,RetroRodent,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Dreadwing's a party pooper. Reading guides they just say to make sure you have titanium armour, so I went once I had that and he handed my my own ass. As you can't progress beyond titanium without loot Dreadwing drops, I've just been hunting temples and tombs for good weapons."
starbound,38mhmg,LuizPSC,9,Fri Jun 5 04:16:27 2015 UTC,"You can find diamonds on all planets, even the starting one. If you dig down a little ways you're sure to find a bunch of them."
starbound,38mhmg,Varixai,6,Fri Jun 5 04:46:09 2015 UTC,"If you want a diamond, it is crazy to set up a meeting with someone. Just use commands.  First, you'll need admin, so type ""/admin"" into the chat (without the quotes) and it should say that your character has been given admin privileges (or something like that). Once you are done using commands you can type ""/admin"" again to toggle off admin privileges.  Once you're admin, you can type ""/spawnitem diamondore"" and it should spawn a single diamond where your mouse pointer is. I'm pretty sure ""diamondore"" is the name for a diamond, but if that spawns a little green ""perfectly generic item"" that means the item name is wrong, in which case I would suggest trying simply ""/spawnitem diamond"" it should definitely be one of those two.  If you feel like this is cheating, just trash the items you would've traded to somebody."

starbound,38jtgb,SupaSlide,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:47:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't understand the question. As of right now, I don't think there is any way to make it so that the UI is positioned differently.  I really wish they would just fix up the system so that the position doesn't keep getting reset, because it does stay in place for a little while they obviously have the system sort of set up. I guess it's just a bug that needs ironing out."
starbound,38m0op,numerius,2,Fri Jun 5 02:21:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe the different species have managed to set up some sort of alliance where they have all adopted one language.  Or maybe it is some sort of translator that your ship has built into it, like the TARDIS :P"
starbound,38m0op,SupaSlide,2,Fri Jun 5 04:24:14 2015 UTC,"In my mind it's an automatic translation system; probably a standard implant, or built into the Matter Manipulator. Since we see the characters' speech as text but hear no voice, I like to think that the characters hear the voices as is and just understand what's being said, a bit like watching a foreign language film with subtitles.  .  Edit: Come to think about it, it might be cool to have some Sims-like gibberish voices for when the NPCs etc are talking..."
starbound,38m0op,ulodetero,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"Linguistics skill tree eh, wouldn't mind that. Major outposts would likely have a protocol droid or some kind of terminal that can translate for the visitors, but it would be cool to be able to learn various languages and see the gibberish get translated the more of a particular language you know. Also better language ability = access to more of that faction's quests, small things like that. Really helps RP.  And yeah if you don't want to bother with this feature then just build a translator, although I'd argue that you should get some kind of reaction bonus for speaking the local language compared to someone else who just shoves a translation device in the other guy's face."
starbound,38m0op,popability,2,Fri Jun 5 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"To clarify: I was talking about having gibberish voice sounds, just so there's a voice effect, but still having the text as a kind of subtitle.  But yeah, language learning might be cool, as an optional mode perhaps."

starbound,38hm5r,lazarus78,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"Far as your log shows, your game should work fine. And this really isn't the place to troubleshoot such problems."
starbound,38hm5r,Sheega,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:26:26 2015 UTC,Where is the place
starbound,38jq25,-Avaricia-,4,Thu Jun 4 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert at all, but it is common to follow the tutorial missions, they teach the very bare bones basics after all.  Otherwise, Base building has actually become something viable! Multiple bases even! The current stable release has placeable teleport pads, which require special cores, found randomly or from quests, and Pixels...You buy them at the outpost (Which if you haven't gotten to, it is pointed at via the tutorials) These will allow you to place a pad down, which you can teleport directly to from your ship, so you can build a base somewhere, and easily return and maintain it, and any farms."
starbound,38jq25,Azurestone,2,Thu Jun 4 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"""Don't die""  Nah I'm kidding honestly; you really don't lose much on (casual? normal?) mode - unless you plan to print out hundreds of expensive objects."

starbound,38l2vf,erisdiscord,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:01:35 2015 UTC,I don't want to hijack your thread but are you experiencing incredibly long start-up times in OSX?  When I start Starbound I hear the chuckle and then see the loading animation for more than 5 minutes...  (It took awhile before but since this last stable update it seems to take even longer).  I'm assuming this will be fixed eventually... maybe?
starbound,38lk0o,Byzantine_Guy,3,Fri Jun 5 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"Weapons are randomly generated and tiered in the game its kinda hard to point out some good weapons just find one that deals the most damage. pretty much all you need to beat the EMF (Erchius Mining facility) is speed. yup that's it speed. to be more specific, the energy dash tech beating the erchius horror (the boss at the end) requires flicking 4 levers. you should do this before it starts spawning minions. so just RUSH RUSH RUSH and your good. weapons are only good for reaching the boss and taking care of his minions so don't worry to much about it. also you will DEFINITELY need a shield. TOTALLY. no seriously bring a shield"
starbound,38he5p,Wulf_Oman,2,Thu Jun 4 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"I don't do nightlies anymore since I'm a modder. Can those who use it tell me what their favorite addition is so far/what they find the ""best"" addition?"
starbound,38he5p,Bellofortis,3,Thu Jun 4 10:11:36 2015 UTC,"I so far have enjoyed seeing the new randomly generated weapons the most, gives some variety and 'ooh shiny' moments. The buying/selling interface is also implemented and functioning which is great. I can't tell if I'm just crazy or there are additional personality stances as well?   I'm mostly a builder honestly and waiting to see the colony system start to get put in. Excited to see plans for the future, will we get to name the colony, make it an organization, pick flags/uniforms and assign jobs? I hope that having a village gets more in depth than terraria's sort of ""build a house that I'd like!"" That we've seen hinted so far."

starbound,38he5p,Bellofortis,3,Thu Jun 4 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"The unstable/nightly branch should be organized as a seperate game in your steam library now underneath Starbound in ""Starbound - Unstable"". From there you right click it, go into properties > betas and pick nightly from the dropdown. If the unstable version isn't showing up at all I'm not sure how to help, maybe contact steam support?"

starbound,38he5p,98521745639852174563,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest here. I pirate before I buy, to make sure I don't feel regret for buying an incomplete or broken game. I downloaded Starbound, and enjoyed it immensly. I got to the point where you use the gate to get to the outpost, and my computer just... completly slowed down. I was getting maybe 1 frame every 4 or 5 seconds. I googled it, and found that this problem goes back at least 4 months.  Has outpost lag been fixed in the steam version? Its the only thing giving me pause with buying this game."
starbound,38he5p,monkeymonkeylasvegas,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:57:02 2015 UTC,"Which version do you have? There's a mod for the latest stable that mitigates the lag. Additionally, you could also try disabling vsync and renderSleep in your sbboot.config.  Anecdotally, a few stables ago - maybe during Koala - the outpost was downright unplayable for me as well. This stable (and by extension, the nightly) seems to have addressed this issue, but don't take my word for it."
starbound,38he5p,God_of_Fun,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:37:17 2015 UTC,"Love the buying and selling system, farming on the large scale to get mass pixels has been slightly tedious and I'm hoping that vehicles will come with some kind of autoharvester. Any legitimate method that would allow me to hold E while moving to harvest would be great, and if it moves even slightly faster than walking, all the better. I'm sure other people would be way more excited to see a flyable ""UFO"" though.   Also, what happened to avesmingo juice? It has a price when you spawn it in and sell it, but it has no method of crafting anymore."
starbound,38he5p,ender1200,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:30:36 2015 UTC,"Any tips on finding Matter manipulator Modules? I started to play nightly and I'm getting to the point where I need to upgrade my Metter manipulator to carry liquids, but I haven't found any modules yet.  edit: spelling."
starbound,38he5p,WraithofSpades,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:44:38 2015 UTC,"MM modules feel a bit more rare than recent nightly builds but upgrading the MM doesn't eat the modules anymore.  1 to upgrade power, 5 to upgrade to liquid and, rather than eat up that 1 first and then another 5, it now just takes 5. This shows a lot more as the cost for upgrades increases. For instance, it costs 8 to increase the size of the mining area so previously it required you to find 14 MM modules, now you just need the 8.  I don't know if that's intentionally developed or if that's something they'll change (hope not) but it's definitely made it easier to upgrade."
starbound,38f915,Nickleass,6,Wed Jun 3 20:43:26 2015 UTC,I like the idea of having it integrated into S.A.I.L.  I'd also like a way to not have to re-invite someone to a party every time they disconnect/reconnect.
starbound,38f915,russjr08,2,Wed Jun 3 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"No reason for it to be tied to SAIL, shouldn't have to go to my ship to see who's online. It should just be a key you press that brings up a player list, and allow you to add them to your party.  While we're suggesting multiplayer UI stuff though I reaaaally wish there was a server list like Minecraft or Don't Starve Together. In fact they should just take everything about DST's multiplayer system (Steam integration + dedicated server support)."
starbound,38f915,Russeru,5,Wed Jun 3 22:45:17 2015 UTC,(Steam integration + dedicated server support).   I would love to be able to invite friends to your server through the Steam overlay (even if it wasn't implemented directly in the game. I think I've seen games where you invite people through the overlay. Tiy doesn't want tons of Steam integration so as not to make the non-steam users feel segregated).  And what do you mean by dedicated servers? I'm not familiar with DST's system. Do you mean a dedicated server as in something I could set up on my own server to run all the time?
starbound,38f915,SupaSlide,2,Thu Jun 4 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah DST has all the cool Steam tunneling stuff so a friend can join you easily without you having to do all the port-forwarding stuff, but they also recently added a dedicated server client, which is basically what Starbound uses now. Just a program you can run in the background that runs the server.  Personally I hope they don't hold back semi-essential Steam integration just to satisfy a small percentage of people who don't want to use Steam for whatever reason. The multiplayer stuff and of course Workshop support would improve the game a lot and give it way more longevity."
starbound,38f915,Russeru,3,Thu Jun 4 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm hoping Tiy changes his mind. They have probably realized by now that a huge majority of their players are on Steam, and I actually saw when the whole ""paid mods"" fiasco went down that Tiy was interested in using the Steam workshop and allowing paid mods (or some other system) because he wants modders to be able to receive compensation for hard work, so that gives me hope that Chucklefish is considering Steam workshop. But Nexus is a close second I guess if that doesn't pan out."
starbound,38f915,SupaSlide,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:10:54 2015 UTC,"Technically, ALL players are on steam. You have to buy the game through steam, after all. However, the game is otherwise DRM free. You can run the game without steam running."
starbound,38f915,lazarus78,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:34:20 2015 UTC,IIRC there used to be a way to purchase Starbound (in the early stages of it's release) without ever having to use Steam? Through a service like Desura (if not Desura exactly)? Maybe I'm just crazy :P
starbound,38f915,SupaSlide,3,Thu Jun 4 17:25:45 2015 UTC,I think the benefit of using Steam integration heavily outweighs the current way it is. Port-forwarding is honestly quite a pain in the ass.
starbound,38f915,RiceOnTheRun,2,Thu Jun 4 03:55:52 2015 UTC,Only for people that have no idea what they are doing. Port forwarding is honestly one of the easiest things you have to do.  Keep steam out of the equation as much as possible.
starbound,38f915,lazarus78,2,Thu Jun 4 16:30:08 2015 UTC,Not when you have to use University wi-fi.

I'm sure Chucklefish could do something like that, if they bothered with it."
starbound,38f915,owenkass,2,Wed Jun 3 22:39:00 2015 UTC,Showing coordinates is bad. The primary security feature you have is by being hidden.
starbound,38f915,lazarus78,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, security isn't that big of an issue when you've got logs. If a planet is griefed, it can always be rolled back."
starbound,38f915,owenkass,2,Thu Jun 4 20:20:45 2015 UTC,I think he was referring to avoiding contact as a primary preventative measure to avoid needing to do so in the first place. starbound has a lot of space for people to disappear into
starbound,38f915,Luissen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:49:16 2015 UTC,Exactly my point. Displaying people's coordinates makes hiding impossible.

If you want coordinates there is a huge Coordinates Megathread on the forums. You can use the search function to search only in that thread.

starbound,38ayda,sssssssssssstarbound,6,Wed Jun 3 08:11:48 2015 UTC,This is pretty good. The Starbound dev team should work on a system that incorporates player made builds into the vanilla world generator either based on a vote system or a team they would hire to curate it.
starbound,38ayda,SupaSlide,2,Wed Jun 3 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"That would be near impossible if they want a consistent world generation. As they add new things to the terrain generation it will cause inconsistencies between worlds depending on when they were generated, meaning that players couldn't reliably share coordinates."
starbound,38ayda,sssssssssssstarbound,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:31:45 2015 UTC,I see your point. There's no way to implement this without the player needing to start a new game or some kind of partial wipe. But maybe the universe is so large that it wouldn't matter as much?
starbound,38ayda,SupaSlide,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:21:29 2015 UTC,"Well the problem arises more in the way that procedural generation works.  If they add a new structure to get generated into the world, it means that the procedural generation will now generate differently then it did before because it now must take into account the new structure.  Having a constantly evolving and changing generation code can cause a lot of issues depending on how it's handled. For an extreme example you can look at Minecraft and see what happens to the world when the generation code changes and the player loads a new chunk and you get extreme changes."

starbound,38ayda,Socrathustra,3,Wed Jun 3 13:06:01 2015 UTC,Because everyone knows that moderators are able to eliminate all trolls.
starbound,38ayda,fleegle2000,4,Wed Jun 3 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"It depends on the system of moderation you use. If submissions have to pass through a human moderator before they are even visible in-game then there is no reason they couldn't block every obvious troll/phallic artist. True, subtle trolling might be able to slip through. Since Chucklefish is making the content available to everyone in the game, I imagine there would be some serious quality control. They could, for example, hold competitions where the best entries get included in the game."
starbound,38ayda,JProllz,2,Wed Jun 3 19:05:42 2015 UTC,You underestimate the sheer flood of trolling such a system can create. No amount of mods can hold back a tide of phalli.

starbound,382ro3,TanzNukeTerror,-7,Mon Jun 1 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"He's not, actually. But the dev team has reached out to him to incorporate some of his designs into the game officially after his posts gained so much attention here.  He doesn't work at Chucklefish in the UK, and may not even be getting paid for all we know. I doubt that would be publicly announced either way."
starbound,382ro3,MagicianXy,7,Mon Jun 1 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"Having the dev. team (Tiyuri specifically) reach out to him to have him make content for Starbound, means he's technically part of the dev. team now."
starbound,382ro3,Varixai,-5,Mon Jun 1 16:35:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know about that. Is he getting paid to make these maps? If so, then I'd consider him to be an official dev and part of the team. However, it sounds more like CF liked his dungeon designs, so they showed him how to format them best for Starbound (using the Tiled software) and then had him come up with anything he liked, as a volunteer. If that's the case, I think he's more of a contributor than an actual developer. If he were a developer, he would be part of Chuckefish, which I don't think he is."

I'd like to imagine the Novakid as genious tinkerers who build their own stuff pretty much to individual taste.

starbound,381mcw,Wulf_Oman,2,Mon Jun 1 19:10:24 2015 UTC,The airlock works by proximity scanners and by manually using the exterior door. The drains trigger when the door is closed and the scanners sense you. The interior door opens when the room is drained and the scanners sense you. The lights in the airlock are connected to the scanners. All of the other lights automatically turn off when leaving the airlock and on when entering. The buttons by the teleporter also switch them.

I can say that I'm glad I did. The survival aspects would have become tedious for me, which would have been a bit too much tedium combined with how much of a slog mining is at the beginning.  That said, I would really love to see those mechanics return in full-force. Starbound has a lot of potential for versatility. We can already use the /admin command to basically create a ""creative mode"", so I'd like to see a way to institute a full ""survival mode"". It would create more of a challenge and make exploring the universe feel more significant. Especially in the case of heat/cold shields.

starbound,381zns,Milguas,3,Mon Jun 1 09:31:48 2015 UTC,"Since there is a fair bit of criticism I'd like to say, I'm actually one of the people who didn't like the old hunger system. It added a nice bit of flavor to the early game but quickly devolved into a mindless ""eat burger every x minutes (or die)"". With the new system CF made a step in the right direction by providing a variety of different foods with various buffs to choose from, except the new system was crippled by excessive cooldowns which made food plain not worth the effort.  With this mod I tried to make something that would provide the ""survival flavor"" early on and then transition into a system that is better at managing food buffs than never-ending Well Fed timers. Hence I came up with a system under which your ability to consume food is based on a dynamic bar, where you can choose to starve yourself and eat many items for a big boost or maintain one set of buffs consistently.  Sure, farming food is not challenging, it cannot be in a game like Starbound. But the point of the mod is not so much to make you think about how to obtain food and more about what kind of food you want to eat and when. It is supposed to make you stockpile resources before a long mining trip or dungeon, make you think about what to bring and how much you need and make you take a break every now and then to build your farm and harvest produce. And while I am praising my own work here I do think I was reasonably successful."
starbound,381zns,Image_Not_Available,6,Wed Jun 3 06:28:57 2015 UTC,Nice i miss the survival mechanic of this game!
starbound,381zns,Kurohame,2,Mon Jun 1 08:31:32 2015 UTC,"I like how all the dissenters to hunger are being downvoted.   Personally I'm alright with not having the hunger mechanic, but the heat mechanic should be more involved than switching a suit. It adds feel to the world being wild and dangerous. If there's a blizzard outside, you should have more preparation than throwing on your winter coat.  Hunger does add some survival aspect, but it's pretty minimal considering the ease of growing crops. That basically boils down to returning to your home planet whenever you run out of food to harvest more. That's made especially easy now due to teleporters. Not particularly in-depth."
starbound,381zns,ZoomBoingDing,2,Mon Jun 1 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"The flip side to that is that I remembered traversing a cold planet at night just being ""walk until your bar empties, throw down a campfire, sit until the bar is full, pick your fire up and keep walking"".  More involved survival could conceivably be interesting but they'd need some entirely new survival mechanics. Also it's the kind of thing (like pets and bug collecting) that they should work on after they have core combat, enemies, and progression that are actually fun."
starbound,381zns,lojician,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:03:18 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. Mostly I'd like a more involved system than ""put on the suit"" but a string of campfires is likely not the best solution."
starbound,381zns,ZoomBoingDing,2,Tue Jun 2 03:12:39 2015 UTC,I'll be fine with it as long as food is just automatically consumed from your inventory. I don't want to starve to death with a stack of hamburgers in my backpack just because I afk'd.

Anyway, I'll use this mod until CF comes to their senses."
starbound,381zns,NonBritGit,10,Mon Jun 1 10:52:34 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The point of Starbound was never to be a hardcore survival sim. Requiring eating and drinking only leads to tedium for the majority of players that really just want a space-themed sandbox game.  Kudos to CF for making Starbound moddable to the point where people can implement new mechanics that other people want to see, though."

starbound,381zns,Wulf_Oman,2,Mon Jun 1 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"As long as it returns to vanilla as a high-difficulty option and/or mods exclusively there's nothing to complain about.  However if hunger and temperature is reinstated as a tedius survival mechanic I'll lose my interest in the game.  In fact I could only really get into the game AFTER hunger/cold had been taken out. Before that the game just rotted away in my library.  Take away from that what you want, but having SB as an action adventure/exploration/creative platformer is vastly preferable to me than having yet another grindy survival sim.  Other's already stated above that with the rapid growth times of most relevant crops the survival aspect is undermined from the start anyway. So what then? Does anybody REALLY want to make crop farming a tedious waiting game? Does anybody REALLY want to not being able to buy food for low prices at the Outpost, thus having enough food anyway, once you set up your teleporter bookmark to the 2-Stop Teleshop? Unless these factors are adressed and nerfed, reintroducing hunger does not make sense on any level EXCEPT (!) for the nostalgia crowd.  And most people, apart from a very vocal minority, do not seem to belong to that club."

starbound,381zns,Wulf_Oman,2,Mon Jun 1 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"If people enjoyed it as a survival mechanic at all, they weren't playing Starbound. There was no challenge in the system (starter seeds that grow in ten minutes? Widely available and easily accessible alternative food sources?), there was no depth (you must eat before a certain period of time or else you will die), and, overall, the system just sucked in its implementation. If this mod adds a remotely similar system, it's a crappy mod.  It's also not a surprise, really. After xxswatelitexx remade temperature, I expected hunger to make a return eventually. I just hoped it would be better than the old hunger system like how swat's mod was better than the original temperature system ... and from the sound of it, it's not. It doesn't take into account any of the variables necessary to make a remotely challenging experience. It's a pseudo-difficulty mod that focuses on nostalgia-whoring.  And don't act like one of their allies, Wulf. I distinctly remember you adding items in one of your mods that disabled the old hunger system."

I have put up the walls for most of the tanks, added refill indicators on the control panel, and started planing efficient pipes for the more distant tanks.

It's a problem that people can just get incredibly, incredibly unlucky and never find any manipulator modules. It's likely that you'll also be able to get them elsewhere in future, whether that be via a vendor or from quests etc. Just something that needs tweaking and balancing.  Keep in mind they don't just appear in tech chests, in fact it's more likely that you'll find a tech card in those. They can appear in the podchests too. And some of the wooden ones."
starbound,380zle,Supernorn,2,Mon Jun 1 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"I looted at least two dozen of chests, and I only got 2 of them. I'm more concerned by the fact that some players have starting systems quite smaller than others, like mine has 12 planets (not couting moons).

starbound,380zle,Tidus17,8,Mon Jun 1 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is you are attempting to play the game while they are in the middle of adjusting the progression system. On release things will be a lot different. Chests will be more rare, but almost always contain good items. On top of that, the currently incomplete loot pool means items are competing with other items that they shouldn't be, making certain things overly hard to find. There will also be quests to attain MM upgrade modules. Try not to judge the game based on nightly progress as it is always changing."
starbound,380zle,quiqksilver,23,Mon Jun 1 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"OP isn't judging the game, they're giving feedback which is the whole reason for the game being early access."
starbound,380zle,Enderbro,0,Mon Jun 1 07:26:20 2015 UTC,But the feedback doesn't matter because it's incomplete. Imagine I'm making you breakfast and you come over and dip your fingers in the uncooked eggs and try to provide me feedback based on that.
starbound,380zle,quiqksilver,2,Mon Jun 1 13:51:56 2015 UTC,"But that's comparing apples to oranges. You're right; you can't sample raw food and expect that to taste almost identical to the cooked finished product.  Early access games are different, though. Chucklefish has largely been responsive to their community's requests or ideas and they take criticism and work it out and improve the experience.  Let's say, for lack of other argument, that /u/monkeymonkeylasvegas never mentioned the slow progression issue of manipulator modules being hard to find or needing too many of them. Let's say that no one in the forums does, either. They all think that Chucklefish will definitely fix it in the finished product, so why say anything?  The finished product arrives and, lo and behold, manipulator modules are still super rare and you still need too many of them. Players question Chucklefish; why would you leave it like this? Why didn't you change it? You knew it was too slow! Chucklefish's response shouldn't come as a surprise; ""How were we supposed to know? No one said anything.""  I do agree with you to a degree. The progression is slow and the modules are too rare so I figure Chucklefish will be manipulating the matter to make it a little faster. 1 module to faster mining, 3 to liquid collection, etc. It helps them, though, to see that what they will likely be fixing in the future is something that the players want, too.  Wall of text to say, user/player criticism is good for the creative process."
starbound,380zle,WraithofSpades,5,Mon Jun 1 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/wraithofspades. It's unfinished, yes, but I see it as not quite the same as uncooked eggs; perhaps closer to a soup that's still cooking, but edible. There's still a chance for people to say that it needs a bit more salt, or a bit more basil, or a bit more of whatever before putting it on the table. Or like a writer putting their work through an editor. It's the editor's job to say ""Chapter 10 was really confusing,"" and ""Bob doesn't seem to be adding to the storyline at all."" It wouldn't work if the editor just sat back and said, ""Meh, it's not done yet, let's see how this work turns out on publication date...""  Even if it weren't early access and they were developing the game in a more traditional manner, it's still a good idea to give the game to testers before publishing, so that they don't publish glitches or messed up mechanics that could have easily been remedied."
starbound,380zle,Kra_gl_e,-2,Mon Jun 1 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"But surely you can see how this post is useless to the devs? They are actively changing the entire progress system as we speak and the nightly build is updated day by day. This means that anyone who plays during that time is going to find it incomplete. Should he also post about how the Floran hunting mission is not completable?  No, because the devs aren't finished with it yet. Now, don't get me wrong here, criticism is absolutely invaluable to the team, but it has to be placed correctly. When the progression system is finished, that is the time for criticism, because then everyone can see the big picture the team is shooting for and any glaring flaws it may have brought about. People are so quick to jump on here and complain about something from the nightly but somehow fail to see what's actually happening is a long term, fundamental change to the progression system and that won't happen overnight."

You seem to be treating critique in that very unhealthy way.   Useless critique is stuff like ""The game sucks, it's too slow and I don't like combat""  It doesn't say anything and doesnt identify a real issue It's too general.   However OP's post is specific in that it shows why something is too grindy and how much of an issue it can be to progression. While the devs may be planning to address this, there is no way for OP or anyone to know exactly what will be done.  Not bringing it up is more damaging.   You don't have to wait for something to be entirely done to put input into it. At worst someone says ""I'm already on it, it just hasn't been fully implemented yet"". It hurts no one."

The majority of the time, posts like these are from people that don't keep up with development and believe what they see is the final product, which is far from the case.  Plus, IMO, the items are just fine in rarity. Why would I say anything on the matter? If all the devs see are people complaining about it, then they will make a change based on the vocal minority, like the change they made to the mining facility boss.

Why do they do this? It's a pretty decent way to use up less power and put less of a strain on your system. Optimization has always been an issue for Starbound.  That all being said, weather does not take in the fact that your house is 100% covered so if it's big enough to the point where the game starts to cut off your house, it'll straight up rain inside your own house. Granted that there's an open area above your house. Actually, thinking about it. Your house doesn't even have to be big, it just has to go off screen.  An option would be to leave a hole or two inside of your house to let the water drain out, that's the best option I can think of aside from building into a mountain or building underground.  Building a glass dome overhead would also achieve the same thing, if you're insistent on keeping your house. At least I hope so, but then the glass wouldn't be drawn and neither would your house if it works the way I believe it does.

If the door is open, it can run left into the house and down your mine shaft. Try removing the cobblestone back-wall that goes above ground level and see if that solves it.  Otherwise, I noticed this issue with my home as well when I had a mine-shaft I would travel up and down. At a certain depth down the hole, the game would have the house loaded, but not the roof, so rain would gather. But it sounds like you're having issues even while stationary in your home.  Haven't played in a while, but I believe there's a drain you can place to remove water. You could probably put it near the floor to keep it from collecting."

starbound,37yml4,TanzNukeTerror,0,Sun May 31 20:16:41 2015 UTC,However when you are for example underground your house may load just partially and then water probably flooded your house.

starbound,37yml4,sbLora,8,Mon Jun 1 15:47:20 2015 UTC,It only happens during heavy rain and thin ceilings. Thicken up your roof a bit more and it should stop... or add drains to your house.
starbound,37yml4,reoneclipse,6,Sun May 31 16:35:52 2015 UTC,"The main issue is the thin walls and slanted roofs, add in another block and all flooding will be gone."
starbound,37yml4,Jynx2501,4,Sun May 31 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is something that I had to deal with too! There's only a couple of solutions:   Never move away from your house while on planet. Doing so may potentially cause additional flooding. Thickening roofs or walls will not help you here, since Starbound will not draw them if you are at a certain distance from the house. Relocate the house to a planet that has no rain. Remove rain's flooding properties from Starbound via a mod. This is the decision that I went with. If you wish, I can give you the mod."
starbound,37yml4,nrutas,3,Sun May 31 17:52:31 2015 UTC,Probably termites hiding in the garden.  Try a layer of cobblestone and call me in the morning.  Maybe an awning over the doors to push the water further out too.

starbound,37yml4,Varixai,2,Sun May 31 19:48:41 2015 UTC,The downpours sure made filling my water reservoir easy though.
starbound,37xgk0,Mackinz,13,Sun May 31 05:20:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you remember me. I'm the guy who updated CompactCrops to the Giraffes. As it stands now, I am kind-of the most knowledgeable person on farmable objects at this point (not bragging), and I have stumbled upon something in vanilla Starbound that really bugs me - crops. In real life, you don't walk into a grassland and just randomly find Corn or Wheat growing. These crops are the byproduct of hundreds to thousands of years of domestication by Humans for the express purpose of growing in a human-made environment (a field) and are not hardy enough to survive on their own for too long. In Starbound, you encircle planets hoping to stumble upon crops randomly generated within a given biome. This descrepancy gave me an idea for a new mod, and I guess you can consider this post is the ""official"" announcement of...  FarmBound!  In this mod, I hope to do two things:  1) Add new microdungeons to random terrain generation that act like any other generated surface structures - Farms. 2) Remove most randomly generated crops from terrain generation.  This would have the effect of adding sense to Starbound biomes and, possibly, make obtaining these crops easier and less random (maybe), but I'm not really here to discuss the purpose of the mod (though you can comment on it if you like). I am here to ask for comments and criticism about the designs of the farms I've already made. For the last few days, I've been pestering people in the modding IRC about my farm designs, and I'm sure they're sick of it by now. For now, I think I've got them done pretty good, and in ways that suit the vanilla races in Starbound, but I am always open to further criticism.   If you would like to see the full album, you can click the link I submitted or here, but you can also look at the individual designs by clicking the links below:   Avian Farmhouse Human Ranch Floran Hunt and Gather Hylotl Hideaway Novakid Saloon Apex High-Rise Farm Glitch Homestead   All farms were built on the same world, a Barren world which had to be terraformed a bit. Sorry for the mismatch in ground color (it bugs me too). If you have any critiques, let me know!"
starbound,37xgk0,Wulf_Oman,5,Sun May 31 05:21:19 2015 UTC,"Love the designs Mackinz, I'm all for this. I thought of an idea similar to this back in Koala but never went through with it - so I'd most definitely play it. Can you drop a link as a reply when/if you finish?  Any luck on Avali support at some point? I wouldn't mind stumbling across some farms on cold planets.  My only real ""criticism"" is - Can you try and only generate them on certain planets that make sense? Like Avians on deserts, Novakids on magma planets, hylotl in oceans, Human and Glitch in actual logically habitable planets?  Edit: Upon further reading: I fully agree with this"
starbound,37xgk0,rhaokja,7,Sun May 31 13:55:58 2015 UTC,"Nice work, I'll go through each one and give what feedback I can.    Avian: I really like the overall feel, especially the thatch roof shelter. I would like to see the main building made from mud bricks though, it would add to that hot weather feel the Avians have.    Human: I think the feel is all wrong, it's too generic. I'd paint the wood white and give it a pointy roof.    Floran: Looks good, throw in some scrap tech?    Hylotl: I like the water farm aspect. I'd be tempted to redesign with a lower building and some support beams.    Novakid: This one is perfect. Really great job.    Apex: The building fits their style but doesn't work well without a lot of other Apex structures around it. I'd want to redesign to make it look more independent from Big Ape.    Glitch: Looks great! I would want to give the building some irregularities so it looks more ad-hock.    Hope this helps, good work!"
starbound,37xgk0,Darkpursuer,7,Sun May 31 08:12:51 2015 UTC,"Apex: Another way to do this is an Apex hydroponics farm, so it would fit with a lab setting."
starbound,37xgk0,Gamermagnet,5,Sun May 31 09:00:34 2015 UTC,The human one could be more tech based like the outposts or prisons.
starbound,37xgk0,GraniteMouth,3,Sun May 31 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"I like the idea quite a bit. I'm always up for seeing more generated structures.    I do have a suggestion if you're up for it. Try playing around with the modular generation aspects of dungeons. It's used in large dungeons and towns, but it can also be applied to smaller structures. Modular generation can be used for different placements of furniture, crops, or even npcs. It could add so many subtle changes and help keep everything unique."
starbound,37xgk0,laz2727,3,Sun May 31 06:17:54 2015 UTC,The main problem is that it's way harder to find a generated structure than a planet. I would really like to see terra shop sell these instead.
starbound,37xgk0,laz2727,2,Sun May 31 06:42:56 2015 UTC,"Also a possibility that I like. Maybe both randomly generated farms and seeds sold at the Terramart - although, the upcoming merchant update will change the Terramart UI, and the Terramart seems to be Chucklefish's ""if its remotely related to living things, it gets sold here""  place (see: Pet items sold in Terramart). Someone has to make a new Outpost shop for more of the random stuff.. :P"
starbound,37xgk0,rhaokja,3,Sun May 31 06:45:29 2015 UTC,"There's already a random stuff shop. And btw, pet stuff is sold in these shops irl too."
starbound,37xgk0,Thanatos-IV,3,Sun May 31 06:54:36 2015 UTC,"Had a crack at modifying some of them with the changes I mentioned.    Avian I think the flat roof helps the look of the thing. Tried it with sandstone and it looks okay.    Glitch I was pretty happy with the modifications here. The rounder roof paid off well.    Human This was harder to do than I thought, I'm not sure it's hitting the right notes. :/"
starbound,37xgk0,Wulf_Oman,3,Sun May 31 10:29:15 2015 UTC,"They look great, but it appears that the staircase to the second level in the Glitch Homestead is placed wrong. The last block makes the stairs jut out, when it should be one block lower."
starbound,37xgk0,sometimesbutnever,2,Sun May 31 12:19:09 2015 UTC,"These are definitely great modifications, though"
starbound,37xgk0,Teyar,2,Sun May 31 14:03:48 2015 UTC,"I do prefer the look of the sandstone bricks over the Avian bricks. I will be changing that, but I don't really see the point of the bench on top of the house as there is no ""logical"" way to get on top aside from jumping. Might have to add another platform there.  I also  like the rounded roofs and the little balcony on the redone Glitch home. Will be adding that, though I may shift the stair case over a bit because it doesn't have the flat edge.

starbound,37s40x,sbLora,36,Fri May 29 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"Just a little video to show off what I've been working on: some semi-advanced wiring and hydraulics in an underwater base deep beneath my ocean home. I tried my best to make it interesting, with cheesy musical cues and all! No mods were used, this is the vanilla, current stable version of the game. The video speed is increased in some parts just to keep things moving along, hopefully those parts are pretty obvious. Major thanks to /u/SeaJayCJ and /u/quiqksilver for inspiring me to try my hand at wiring, and thanks also to /u/breakfast_organisms for inspiring some of the design of my beach home. Thanks for watching! :)  Here's an explanation of the systems featured in the video, if you wanna know more about anything:  Vertical Airlock Entrance - I didn't know when I started working on this that other folks had beat me to the punch designing a more realistic airlock. I'm pretty happy with my design, though. It may not be fast, but it works exactly how I wanted it to. The main feature here is that the airlock chamber is filled / drained before the doors are opened, but some tweaks of my own include a vertical to horizontal transition, oscillating alert lights, and most importantly, during exit the water will rise to fill the holding chamber, rather than being dumped on your head. Also, I was able to use a hand scanner for the entrance by wiring it to act like a button. At first this whole system took up a huge wall of logic gates and slowed down the framerate, but I was able to optimize this setup until only 15 gates were required, and most of them only control the lights, the hand scanner, and a fix to prevent the airlock from auto-firing when the game reloads.  Warehouse Lights - I don't know what else to call these, but it's just a simple system of chained D-Latches to make the lights in the warehouse and treasure room turn on one at a time, for dramatic effect.  Working Bathtub - This is something I haven't seen in Starbound before, so I apologize if it's already been done, but it's something I've wanted to try out for a while. A timed door (wooden gate) lets just the right amount of healing water out of the tank to fill the bathtub exactly to the top (sorry I turned it off early in the video!) and once the tub is full, the lights turn off and a candle turns on. Turning off the switch drains the tub.  Working Showers (x4) - This was extremely tricky to implement: 4 working showers all supplied by the same water tank. One timed door controls the tank output, and then 2 branching sets of timed doors direct the flow to the correct showerhead. The hardest part was figuring out a design in 2D that looked good but didn't succumb to form over function.  Automatic Refilling Water Tanks - When one of the tanks runs dry, it is automatically refilled by the main water tower. A system of ""pipes"" in the base appear temporarily (in the hallways) and once both tanks are filled, the system shuts off. There's a switch to control how much water should be filled into the larger tank, and an override valve to prevent the system from turning on. The system also will not activate if the main water tower is empty or the path of the pipes is obstructed by a fish outside.  Main Water Tower - I like the airlock on this water tower because it's the smallest realistic one I've ever seen (this also means it's a lot faster). The ""supports"" of the water tower are made out of sliding doors, because background tiles can be hard to see underwater and I didn't want to take up part of the ocean floor with supports / create an obstacle to fish. The supports / pipes (doors) will automatically open when a player or fish swims by, unless there's an automatic refill in progress, and to prevent seawater from spilling into the tanks below, several drains are activated when the doors are opened (and a second afterward to catch all of the water). Also, the water level in the main water tower is shown on an automated display in the control room.  Bedroom Automated Lights / Doors - This is, weirdly, the most complex system in the video, and it takes up the most wall space in the control room with logic gates. Basically, when you enter the room, lights turn on, and likewise with the bathroom. A wall switch turns on a second light in the bedroom, and also prevents the bathroom lights from shutting off when the door is closed. The bathtub switch then turns off the bathroom lights, on a timer, once the tub is full, and turns on a candle. When the bathtub switch is turned off, the bathroom lights are turned back on. All of the lights will also turn off when the switch by the bed is flipped off, or when the room is exited. I don't think I even explained that well... It works well intuitively, just very hard to explain (and wire!)  Warehouse Airlock - Just a simpler example of the realistic airlock, with an added door by the ceiling to let in the crane (which will hopefully one day be working, if I'm reading Chucklefish's hints correctly!)  Base Lights - Though not really shown in the video, the lights for each section of the base are turned on when entered, ALL of them are reset to OFF when the base is exited by either airlock or teleporter.  Large Bathtub - The larger bathtub / hot tub in the house works similarly to the one in the base, except that because it's bigger, I had to chain multiple timers together for the door, as 5 seconds wasn't enough to fill it (and I don't have the new timers from the nightly)."

starbound,37s40x,Shamus03,11,Sat May 30 11:24:10 2015 UTC,"Easy! :) The signs in the outpost have an on state and an off state, so I made some signs and connected them to the liquid sensors in the tower.

But the wiring, the timed lights, the plumbing, the water level display, the treasure room... it's all really cool. Did you use Admin mode to speed it up at all?"
starbound,37s40x,Aggraxis,10,Sat May 30 00:14:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I mainly used admin mode for the fullbright command (to plan out where I was going to build) and spawnitem for materials. It would have taken a ridiculous amount of time to build if I had to mine for iron and craft every time I ran out of iron blocks, for example. 1000 blocks goes a lot faster than you'd think. Also the legendary fishaxe (dev building tool) is super helpful for clearing out blocks.  The treasure room is all stuff I found exploring (either in the current release or stuff I found before my character got wiped that I spawned in). And I had to spawn a lot of hylotl stuff for the house.  The airlocks do take awhile... I never minded before I made this video, because I like watching my inventions work :) but when I was trying to make the video, after multiple attempts, the airlock wait got pretty old."
starbound,37s40x,Yrthak,5,Sat May 30 00:29:02 2015 UTC,"I can totally relate! I want to share my story, because this is the game that they are building, which passes the torch to those willing, and passionate enough about it.  I used all of your above tactics when outlining/filing in my gigantic event tower. Admin privileges certainly are a builder's dream.  Now that I saved the cookie cutter .world file as a backup template and am currently building a giant dungeon in the tower using ""or"" logic gates as wire extenders. Works like a charm!   I'm in the process of tailoring the tower for use with the Wired Monster Spawners+ mod (includes enemy turrets) with a difficulty in mind for Hardcore characters. Kinda like a survival mode, where you grab Weapons as one climbs the tower.   Minibosses will help provide a random factor in loot, and guns can be obtained primarily from enemy turrets I will have set in advance. I'm also including mission bosses at key points of the tower. Mining boss will probably appear more than once, but each one will have a certain strategy for victory.  I completely understand your ambitions with the game, turning the what-ifs into ""How can I make this happen"" It keeps our enthusiasm for Starbound and forces us to learn new things.   I wish you well in your journey sbLora."
starbound,37s40x,orangedonut,4,Sat May 30 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks! Your tower sounds really interesting, I'd love to see it when it's done!

starbound,37s40x,GizmoII,9,Sat May 30 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"Very nice, I love the realism and scale of it all. I also admire all the learning that went into this, and then your willingness to help spread that knowledge around. Thanks for those explanations ;)  Your dedication and innovation in the plumbing is very cool, it's something that many people (including myself many times) just say ""eh, it works in the background somewhere"" rather than trying to account for it.  The layout of the whole place actually stood out to me, I really like your diagonal styling and spacing of the tunnels. They have a sort of sleek modern feel, more so than the ingame USCM Bunker for example (which is just a very different style)."
starbound,37s40x,TheBlackCrowes,6,Sat May 30 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks Varixai! The layout sort of came about by accident, when I built the airlock I was only planning on having a treasure room deep underground, but when I saw how pretty the background paralax looked I knew I wanted big windows close to the surface, and I had to place it pretty far away where the ocean floor was higher. Then I had a lot of space to fill so I started building more rooms. :) The main diagonal passage of the base actually turns into a cool mineshaft below, but I felt like the video was already pretty long without including it.  I'm always impressed with how good the dungeons in the game look, considering all the limitations they have due to how they're spawned. I wish the USCM Bunker's layout felt less arbitrary, but I do love the entrance."

starbound,37s40x,Charmandaar,4,Sat May 30 03:09:50 2015 UTC,Fantastic build! How long did you actually wait for the air lock to fill up?   Meanwhile I'm surviving in my dirt hut storage room.
starbound,37s40x,OwlG5,4,Sat May 30 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I had to go back to the footage and check, it's right about 1:45 to fill the tank, and I think the reason it takes so long is because of the bend in the pipes, but I don't really mind since it still works as intended and looks cool, plus you can teleport in if you don't wanna wait. I wish they'd make water flow faster in the game, would be helpful for a number of applications.  My favorite house I ever built was a dirt hut carved out of a hill! The first house I ever built, I might add, on the first planet I landed on! It was simple, but it was home... until the penguins destroyed it. :)"
starbound,37s40x,Fishums1,5,Sat May 30 03:43:53 2015 UTC,"FRA-KING AWESOME.   Man, I wish I could build some wiring like that. The shower system is just incredible. And I loooooooved the treasure room so much I might steal it ;)"
starbound,37s40x,Fishums1,5,Sat May 30 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's full of stolen goods already, steal away!"
starbound,37s40x,Fishums1,4,Sat May 30 08:25:08 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me how water works in this game? Why does he have to fill whatever room he's in full of water before he can enter? Does the water come from the ocean? Does this drain over time the ocean? Where do the drains go?
starbound,37s40x,Varixai,5,Sat May 30 08:12:55 2015 UTC,"Water in the game works pretty much how you'd expect it to for the most part. The reason the room is being filled with water is that it's an airlock. The main goal is to prevent water from getting into the base when you enter and exit, and there's a lot of simpler airlocks that do that just fine. A more realistic airlock will fill the chamber with water before allowing the door to be opened, because in real life the pressure would need to be equalized first (although it doesn't really matter in the game, just some icing on the cake). The water in the airlock does come from the ocean, through a series of pipes, and flows out through drains, which basically just make it ""disappear"". I don't have a way to make it flow back into the ocean without some sort of pump. Hope that clears things up."
starbound,37s40x,Fishums1,5,Sat May 30 08:21:41 2015 UTC,Oh so the water filling is pretty much just for looks? You could just automatically close the door behind you to block off the rest of the base?
starbound,37s40x,VAiD_,3,Sat May 30 09:19:26 2015 UTC,"You have to have some way to keep water from getting into the base, or else you'll have to bail it out every time with the MM... so it does serve an important function. But yeah, most of it is just bells & whistles."
starbound,37s40x,Rahabic,2,Sat May 30 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it feels a bit like cheating."

starbound,37s40x,Bdotaing,3,Sat May 30 07:54:13 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like about the base is that healing water is not conserved.  I know pumps don't exist in vanilla, and while I have used a mod that added pumps and fluid transport (I wanted to be able to flood my hylotl ship at will), I appreciate what you wanted to do.  I think the airlock is an interesting idea, but pumping water up a column like that would put significantly more pressure on the inner door, and from a realism point of view would require pumping a lot of unnecessary water in and out.  The treasure room is amazing though, both in design and execution.  Simple wiring, but extremely well done."
starbound,37s40x,riscles,3,Sat May 30 13:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, healing water not conserved but you can find tons of it in any oasis minibiome. My ORIGINAL idea would have totally conserved it if it weren't for one tiny problem I found in the game. It would work like this: you're under the ocean, right? And there's tons of pressure from the water above... so you use that pressure to move the healing water for you. Instead of a water tower above the base, you put a huge healing water well below the base, and bring in ocean water from above to PUSH the healing water UP... only problem is that different liquid types don't push each other in Starbound. :(  I disagree about the airlock, though. Sure it's a 2D representation, but there's plenty of real-world examples of airlocks that work this way. Check out NASA's underwater airlock they use for space training! :) Thanks for the feedback!"

starbound,37wtp4,popability,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"One reason may be farming, as different foods give you different buffs (http://starbounder.org/Consumable_Items). Also, in the unstable version there are colonies, so you could build one (http://starbounder.org/Colony_Deed). There has been a huge amount of content added. Check it out here: http://starbounder.org/Version_History I would say yes, or at least for a dozen hours. It takes a while to progress, complete quests, and get the necessary armor and weapons needed to beat the bosses. And when you're done with that, make a pretty house."
starbound,37vobx,Vigil80,3,Sat May 30 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think in the future different characters won't start on the same planet. Keep in mind the game's not done yet.

starbound,37vobx,AlyksthatGuy,2,Sun May 31 04:29:26 2015 UTC,"The Universe (all the planets, the structures that were there before and placed by characters) is shared on one account. Lets say you go to a planet, place down a flag, then go back to the main screen, select another character and go to that same planet using coordinates then the flag will still be there. As for starting on the same planet, I don't think that was intentional but it might be happening anyways. Right now there is no current way to create a separate universe that I know of without removing you're current universe in the files, backing it up, then loading a new one, and having to manually replace it every time you switch characters."

Though I'm sure it's a grave sin by now, I still had the Terraria mindset of being able to create new starts at will.

Outside of IRC they have given exactly zero indication when it will be released. On IRC however:    At least 1 more weeks until Unstable, and at least 2 weeks until Stable.    Dev quote on IRC 2 weeks ago:   May 13 1:37:11 <GXyon> Do we have an ETA when the next Stable patch is going to be? May 13 1:37:38 <metadept> 1-3 months probably May 13 1:37:47 <metadept> not soon     It depends on how much they want to cram into that update and how many issues they run into on the way. For example, the combat overhaul is the main focus of the update, but they are also working on colonies, selling, challenge rooms, and the Avian mission. (Also finishing the Floran mission with Nuru and Ixodoom, but that's nearly done)  If you want to watch their progress more closely you can follow the nightly patch notes on the wiki and Kawa's direct nightly change log.

It probably has to do with their code management process or the complexity of their features, but I do wish they would make more frequent updates (smaller ones) to Unstable and let them cook there & be tested by the players.

starbound,37lkdu,RoDDusty,9,Thu May 28 18:19:42 2015 UTC,It's not a bug. Oil is supposed to transform into lava when they interact.
starbound,37lkdu,Varixai,3,Thu May 28 18:52:29 2015 UTC,Ohhh. Okay then.
starbound,37lkdu,Nanemae,3,Thu May 28 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"This isn't that bug. This is a feature of the liquid system.  When you pour Lava into Oil it gradually converts all the oil to lava. The same thing happens if you pour Poison into Water.  The bug you're referring to circumvented this liquid system by making it so you could convert any liquid into any other liquid, if you made the conversion in super small quantities.  Edit: Damn ninja quiqksilver while I was typing two comments >.>"
starbound,37lkdu,Varixai,1 point,Thu May 28 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like the idea of oil being turned into a liquid fire pool. It'd be really neat if when something was coated in oil and got hit with fire the oil would burn, and the creature coated would be hurt for much more damage than fire attacks currently leave. So while it's a bug, it's a bug I can get behind."

How about an UI (with shortcuts) like the party menu where you could give the pet commands (return to inventory / pod) and set behaviors (passive, defense, aggressive). Maybe something similar what you have in the game Torchlight II? I would like something like than. It's relatively simple and versatile."

starbound,37mz68,TanzNukeTerror,6,Thu May 28 20:37:19 2015 UTC,It would be awesome if pickaxes and drills would yield the original block type and not the 'generic' cobblestone. This would also make them much more useful.
starbound,37mz68,TomCatFort,8,Thu May 28 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"That.. is a very good idea.  I hope pickaxes have a part to play with fossils as well. Makes sense that you would have to use a different tool and take your time on them, as opposed to just sucking up matter."
starbound,37mz68,Varixai,1 point,Thu May 28 23:15:03 2015 UTC,The pickaxes and drills are the faster ones. If you want to take your time you'll need to use the matter manipulator.
starbound,37mz68,Nematrec,3,Fri May 29 16:52:16 2015 UTC,"Thematically though, pickaxes are you chipping away at the blocks until you get a chunk out. The matter manipulator just kinda sucks up the atoms until you get it all, then reconstitute it, so it makes sense that it would end up being a bit homogenized."
starbound,37mz68,_Abecedarius,5,Fri May 29 22:50:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I like this. It would definitely make me keep my pickaxes and drills. Especially since I like building little things here and there. c:"

starbound,37l6ov,somenoefromcanada38,4,Thu May 28 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"I dig it, Someone.  A couple ideas:  1) hydroponics: an underwater base needs a local source of food and oxygen, and it hosts an interesting set of opportunities for creativity! Maybe even an underwater arboretum, as trees are awesome.  2) command center: a great way to disguise some of your wiring is a command center, with many wired consoles and such. It also looks fantastic when data screens turn on when you enter, I use this on my ship.  3) Although it serves no practical purpose, a vehicle airlock/bay would be a fun challenge. Think submarines, with cranes and storage nearby for supply delivery.  Have fun!  Edit: Spelling"
starbound,37l6ov,Tyrill,3,Thu May 28 14:35:50 2015 UTC,"I really liked one of your ideas and am finishing up module 6 with it http://i.imgur.com/PNu4rBF.jpg?1  Tell me what you think! The command center is a great idea, but a bit beyond the scope of what I am doing at the moment, mostly because I'm leaving the interior decorating up to the individual and just creating the empty modules for use. I really like the idea a lot, so I'll probably look into it once I finish up the modules I still have in mind. A vehicle airlock might be interesting if they add any underwater vehicles in the future. I may create this at some point but I am not sure how to do it since there are no doors I know of that are large enough for vehicles to enter at the moment."
starbound,37l6ov,Tyrill,2,Thu May 28 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it, an excellent starting point for folks!  You could use trap doors or similar, which only require background blocks to place, allowing you to create as long an opening as is needed."

Edit: Shot 1: Imgur This shot is detail on the command center in it's current state. I realized I haven't played since the last stable update, so a few things are broken, but the design is mostly there. You can easily add switches in to fit in with the screens, and use tech as appeals :)  Shot 2: Imgur Larger focus on the ship to show the station-keeping light level when no one is using any other part of the ship.  One of the consoles on the bridge will enable all lights, and turn on a ""Red Alert"" section, as well. Fun stuff!"
starbound,37l6ov,Vhyle32,2,Thu May 28 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool, and I have not thought of anything like it.  You could even adapt this for space since it's a zero oxygen environment (last I knew, it could have changed) for like a moon or asteroid.  I liked and subbed, since I'd like to see what else you do with it.  Made me re-download the game, lol!"
starbound,37l6ov,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Thu May 28 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"Oxygen doesn't currently cause issues in the game as you quickly unlock a suit tech that prevents any oxygen loss at all.

The airlocks would serve no function unfortunately, maybe they will change this again in the future."

starbound,37nv18,quiqksilver,3,Fri May 29 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"It's not complicated at all.

starbound,37nv18,rhaokja,5,Fri May 29 04:15:15 2015 UTC,"The Colony Deed wiki page is completely up to date (I just updated it again yesterday). Katzeus and I have been keeping a pretty close eye on it, as it is getting rapid updates.    The problem is mostly the tag system right now. The tags are very much in flux. The developer working on them, /u/tcoxon, has been making near daily sweeps on all the objects in the game tagging and untagging them with various things as the system gets finalized. He has been making the same type of changes to the tenants as well, which are all just placeholders as he tests the system.    As a result of all of the above, the colony system on the Nightly is pretty unstable right now. There is no way to tell the exact requirements of each tenant or what tags any given object has to fulfill those requirements. Therefore, there will be days where tenants will not spawn, or objects that worked the day before no longer work.    Katzeus, Dunto, and I are going to be getting the tags displayed on all the object wiki pages soon (once they settle down a bit). You can see what all tags are in use right now on my dev update post, just to get an idea of how many there are."

starbound,37gnci,GreenFox1505,5,Wed May 27 14:53:23 2015 UTC,oooh if they add in a huge bolder (kinda like the gigantic snowball mechanic) and you could run from it past a series of obstacles would be so cool. :)
starbound,37gnci,-Fennekin-,3,Wed May 27 14:49:20 2015 UTC,Indiana Jones? I'm reminded of Mario...
starbound,37gnci,CheezeDoggs,3,Wed May 27 21:51:16 2015 UTC,They added some rocks that are more bouncy right? You could make an upwards slope that's slightly uneven so that you'd have to run under the rocks when they bounce over you...
starbound,37gnci,Varixai,13,Wed May 27 23:24:03 2015 UTC,My favorite part of your posts is seeing what new silly name you've come up with. ZippityZinc SwiftPlatinum Quiqksilver omg I love it
starbound,37gnci,OmnipotentEntity,8,Wed May 27 16:33:08 2015 UTC,We recently had a brainstorming session on other possible names. :D
starbound,37gnci,OmnipotentEntity,5,Wed May 27 16:42:38 2015 UTC,Do you know if I can edit my name in the assets file with Notepad? Easier to do that than make a new character and unlock everything again.
starbound,37gnci,MrTreazer,10,Wed May 27 17:06:23 2015 UTC,Send me your file and I'll do it.
starbound,37gnci,shitcock55,2,Thu May 28 02:53:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the offer but that won't be necessary. I was wanting to use new names in some gifs but forgot I can just use /warp to get where I need to with a new character instantly. Thanks though!
starbound,37gnci,Varixai,2,Thu May 28 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"No prob, if you need it in the future just PM me."

starbound,37gnci,CheezeDoggs,3,Fri May 29 08:59:37 2015 UTC,"The short answer is no, it's very risky. Omni strongly advises you not to do that since it is super easy to corrupt the whole file. Doing it with a true hex editor is slightly safer, but only just.  There are some other ways you can do it though, example."
starbound,37gnci,Runixo,2,Wed May 27 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"But, starcheat?"
starbound,37gnci,SileAnimus,3,Wed May 27 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"Didn't say they were good ways. :/  That's why the short answer is simply, no you can't."

starbound,37gnci,SwagCow,3,Wed May 27 18:48:39 2015 UTC,I really hope they make them actually deal damage though
starbound,37gnci,zer0t3ch,5,Wed May 27 19:59:27 2015 UTC,Oh they do! And the way trap damage is dealt in the game means it ignores armor for the most part. So you still take a good chunk of damage even if you are geared up.
starbound,37gnci,tehyosh,3,Wed May 27 20:03:20 2015 UTC,At this point starbound should be renamed to quiqksilver's dungeon creator.

starbound,37jhyj,c0mandr,9,Thu May 28 02:04:15 2015 UTC,"They did a massive overhaul in the Nightly for weapons. Starting weapons are weaker, enemies have lower health (I think) and ranged weapons like pistols, shotguns, and rocket launchers can definitely kill monsters in less than one full energy usage. I'll be happy once this gets pushed to the stable.  Though to be fair, Nightly hasn't been too crashy lately."
starbound,37jhyj,WraithofSpades,2,Thu May 28 12:56:55 2015 UTC,"Nightly hasn't been too crashy lately.   I haven't been playing the nightlys, too much downloading over my iffy internet connection, are they coming close to pushing some unstable updates?"
starbound,37jhyj,SupaSlide,1 point,Thu May 28 13:02:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't follow the news that well of their release schedule. I know they've indicated some kind of schedule, but I don't know what it is off the top of my head.  Also, I'm fairly certain that after the initial install for the nightly, future updates are just modifications to the existing file structure. It shouldn't be a huge bandwidth hog, or at least not for long. Maybe I'm wrong on that."
starbound,37jhyj,WraithofSpades,1 point,Thu May 28 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"I heard somewhere, probably 2-3 months"
starbound,37jhyj,Wulf_Oman,2,Thu May 28 15:42:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. Am I able to copy a character over to the nightly client or are there compatibility issues?
starbound,37jhyj,MomiziWolfie,3,Thu May 28 14:06:53 2015 UTC,they will be updated in the upcoming update to be alot better  you can try them out in the nightly
starbound,37jhyj,Gachl,-8,Thu May 28 07:17:53 2015 UTC,can't wait for the next alot to become update.
starbound,37jhyj,Banana_bee,1 point,Thu May 28 08:32:18 2015 UTC,"I actually think that unstable sniper rifles are the most broken weapons in the game, comparatively speaking. and penguin mech is borderline impossible without a machine gun."
starbound,37jhyj,SingedWaffle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is still the case - I haven't played for a few weeks - but last time I played,  armour gave flat damage reduction rather than a percentage meaning that high fire rare weapons were useless. If that's still the case, the only weapons worth using are snipers/rocket launchers/anything with high damage per shot"
starbound,37jggg,Darkpursuer,6,Thu May 28 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"They did something with temperature when the game was just released. There was something like freezing to death when it comes to different planets and climates. It was a pretty neat feature but it was frustrating as heck when you want to explore.    They had armor like the snow infantry set (I think), which negates cold but when you wear it you have terrible armor."
starbound,37jggg,orangedonut,5,Thu May 28 04:59:00 2015 UTC,i would like that back in the game
starbound,37jggg,_ralph_,3,Thu May 28 08:03:18 2015 UTC,"I knew that, but even that was made redundant as soon as you got to midgame armor. But as I said, make preparation of exploration important. A reduced inventory size, a send-to-ship function for furniture collection would definitely help."
starbound,37jggg,neagrosk,2,Thu May 28 05:28:10 2015 UTC,"It was really cool the first time you encountered the climate effect, but after 20 or so planets it really begins to wear on you. It should be an issue to new characters, but later in the game you should also be able to tech up enough to negate climate effects."
starbound,37jggg,sgtjoe,4,Fri May 29 01:55:08 2015 UTC,"My idea of nanosuit progression would be:  LV0: no nanosuits, need to depend on consumables to survive.  LV1: nanosuits, but energy needs to be recharged manually via battery packs.  LV2: Nanosuits will consume battery packs automatically to charge itself whenever it runs out.  LV3: Nanosuits can have up to 2 properties at once.  LVFinal(optional): Nanosuits have infinite energy  That said, consumables are still viable for planets that have multiple threats (poisoned frost fire?)"
starbound,37jggg,sgtjoe,4,Fri May 29 02:04:26 2015 UTC,there are a few threads with this topic. Atmospheres and advanced environment threat management (by having to build a shielded base for example) would add a great deal of content to this game. People who don't want this should also be able to switch that off. (or have a mod... should be easier to disable features than enabling them correctly)
starbound,37jggg,Don_Camillo005,1 point,Thu May 28 09:12:10 2015 UTC,"If devs intend to keeping it simple, I'll just have to hope for a mod that introduce this. I believe there are some mods with a survival theme, but I don't know they are what I'm looking for since i haven't tried them."
starbound,37jggg,Lightningbro,3,Thu May 28 09:13:54 2015 UTC,"If anyone would manage to make a mod like this, I'd be very impressed... There is much potential in having to manage your base: Power, shields, oxygen, food production. Its probably too much to handle for the games engine or hard to program... But imagine an interface like this, where you manage your base and such: link"

starbound,37kdip,MasterGamer1172,2,Thu May 28 22:36:51 2015 UTC,Maybe a famous Floran hunter? (In the lore the Florans are ruthless hunters so botanist seems out of place) (This list is to help me remember) Floran (hunters) - famous hunter maybe? Avian (the religious ones) - Kluex Glitch (Midieval/Renaissance) - famous Glitch king or Shakespeare guy maybe Apex (sciencey science) - Big Ape Novakid (narrow minded space farts from the wild west) - they don't remember much of their history :/ Human (human) - ??? Hylotl (ancient Japan) - ???
starbound,37kdip,blondfishie,2,Fri May 29 02:44:55 2015 UTC,"I guess, maybe that will not work either. Since not every races has their own ""Important People""."
starbound,37kdip,NoTelefragPlz,1 point,Fri May 29 07:18:26 2015 UTC,"Skulls as keys seems a bit cliche (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, for instance) and slightly gruesome for Starbound's theme. Yes, there's skulls in the Floran areas, but that's just their era. Having to go out of your way to look for some head bone seems out-of-place. IMO, an actual key would seem to fit, because keys and keyholes go along quite nicely."

I was trying to get away from that idea; finding the heart is more gruesome than a bone. At the least, couldn't important figures of the different species just have the keys with them? You could fight the Floran for it because Floran hatessss everything, but the Hunting Party seems to have covered the unintended Floran massacre pretty adequately. Those challenge rooms being shown off might have something to do with the keys. Edit: Punctuation"

starbound,37h29p,RCHermit,2,Wed May 27 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be that hard. There's lua support already for imparting momentum to creatures. I think it shouldn't be too hard to hook a weapon attack to that, especially since weapons used to do knockback.  The block destroying part is a little harder. But you can add a 'blockdestroy' status effect to the creature, that checks for collision with tiles, and (again with lua) if collision is detected, it destroys those tiles and removes the status effect."

You'd think there'd be more of an interesting interaction between the Florans and the Avians however, considering the Florans' advance into space travel was all thanks to Avians goofing."
starbound,37k69y,WrethZ,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:10:55 2015 UTC,Well the lore currently says that florans are very easily offended to the point of lethal violence and that the florans invaded the hylotl homeworld.  Considering how self important and snooty the hylotl are it'd make sense that they offended the floran to the point where the floran invaded their planet.
starbound,37k69y,Nanemae,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:20:37 2015 UTC,I was wondering if that was what happened. I was planning on posting a hypothetical reason for why the Floran hate the Hylotl that would been pretty much this. My biggest question is if the plot will be that easy to guess for other races.
starbound,37k69y,Bellofortis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"I hope by the time release state is getting near they've really fleshed out the lore in terms of competing organized bodies in the meta; corps, governments with political strife mentioned, and some secret societies seem to be hinted at so far.

starbound,37k69y,Nanemae,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although that does lend itself to the unsung hero vibe that Starbound currently gives. I mean, how many people do you save throughout the missions, and meanwhile that's apparently what you have to do in order to get a forged ship license. It would be especially neat to get a real ship sometime, one you can go through proper channels to get. That would be amazing, but I seriously doubt that's gonna happen."

I think though this is all a placeholder, just a taste of what's to come in the long haul.   The method of progressing is going to go through a lot of changes. Currently this is just a way of providing us some gameplay to get them that doesn't take excessive time or dev focus to implement, so we don't have to resort to console commands to play.  I think it'd be neat to be able to build a tech themed colony on an asteroid and attract enough sciency residents to build your own ship using gathered materials :3 I dunno, the way the nightly is shaping up (Lotsa new resident types just got added apparently!) It looks like the universe will be a touch more populous than what now seems like everyone is a ragtag collection of survivors."

They turn into a sort of slope unless there's a block below it or something. I played with this behavior for a while. Put a block down, then one over and up, then try to stand in the corner they make.  Ninja-edit: So being that close to a solid block, you're trying to jump down through the slope of that solid block. Move one full tile away, and you should be able to jump down just fine. I'm not sure this is a bug, just intended behavior found somewhere unexpected."

starbound,37gwrw,gullibeans,2,Wed May 27 16:25:21 2015 UTC,Also - it isn't in nightly yet but before the official release they plan to add a bunch of pathing kinds (I remember them saying a few times they want to do one focused on farming aspects soon)  So don't worry too much there
starbound,37gwrw,Wulf_Oman,2,Wed May 27 21:12:33 2015 UTC,"What the devs have been calling colonies are in the nightly but what OP is suggesting is nothing like what's in the game. The 'colonies' in Nightly are what the devs are calling the player built rental homes. The player can build a house and put in a ""house deed"" (or ""rental deed"" I forget the name) and an NPC will spawn in the house and pay rent and sometimes sell or do cool stuff. They aren't really ""colonies"" like OP is suggesting, they are rental buildings (that could be used to build colonies I suppose)."
starbound,37gwrw,SupaSlide,2,Thu May 28 13:28:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I read a little while ago the devs are planning to implement colonies, and recently they've been working on some kind of rent system to facilitate building your own colonies. So there are things in the works. As to how they'll turn out... I can't really say.    If you've been playing for a while you would have noticed the emptiness creep into the game little by little with each patch. I get the feeling that the devs started building a sandbox explorer but then they began adding additional features they liked from more linear games and had to strip their game down a little to accommodate each one. They've got lots of cool things in the game now, but you can't enjoy them because you either feel railroaded down the linear quest line or at a standstill when you go do your own thing or finish the quests.    There are lots of things me and you and everyone else would like to see in this game, and most of those ideas boil down to wanting the sandbox explorer we thought we were getting in the first place. If the game is to feel fulfilling the dev team is going to need to change their perspective on a lot of features because this game is on a fast track to being a really bloated engine for a level based platformer - exploring, digging, building: pointless optional tasks."
starbound,37gwrw,meowth_datz_rite,1 point,Wed May 27 17:00:39 2015 UTC,"There are good reasons why we don't see city worlds in the game. The biggest reason is the ease of space travel, and access to teleportation. These technologies would naturaly result in a diffused population. As we've seen with the rise of suburbs in the last century.   In the lore there are also reasons we shouldn't necessarily see large core worlds. Earth was destroyed recently so if humans are going to build a new capital it's going to take time.   Novakid have short attention spans and do not concern themselves with the usual trappings of civilization. It would be weird for them to build any kind of core world.   The Hylotl were driven from their homeworlds by the Floran.   The majority of Glitch are stuck in the medieval period, unable to progress further. As the player, you play one of the rare ""mad"" Glitch, free to explore and expand.   The Floran culture doesn't seem to value large scale cities. They are tribal scavengers for the most part. In the Floran mission currently in game we see that they don't develop their worlds much. Cities just don't lend themselves to the constantly roaming Floran.   All that being said I would love to visit the Apex or Avian homeworld. It'd be cool just to park in orbit and see thousands of ships out the window."

starbound,37dtym,Soof49,6,Tue May 26 22:15:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much about combat at this point exactly. Starbound is in the middle of a combat update as we speak. There are lots of elements they are adding that will drastically improve the current system both in diversity and in balance. This update is expected to be completed in 1-2 months.
starbound,37dtym,quiqksilver,3,Tue May 26 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, sweet. I'm glad to hear that. I hope they can pull it off pretty well, because that'd be pretty much the icing on the cake (for me. combat is a pretty integral part of the game whenever I play it)"

starbound,37dtym,meowth_datz_rite,5,Wed May 27 10:55:32 2015 UTC,"Look, you're right, but don't hold your breath for better combat. I know they're coming out with some new stuff soon but there's no telling what the end result will be.    The big problem with the combat isn't so much the combat, it's the physics, the randomgen, and the controls. The combat is bad too, but you wouldn't even notice how broken your attacks were if you weren't fighting the game just to get into position to hit something. To fix the physics they'd need to completely rip out their current physics engine and replace it with something tailored more to platforming. They'd have to make sure to generate the right enemies for each fighting environment for monsters to be fun and not an annoyance (Fighting environments like: open, enclosed, flat, hilly, traveling east/west,  climbing up a tower, going down a mineshaft, etc -  these are all more fun with mobs that challenge you in that environment rather than reskins of the same charging pokemon blob).    Others have commented that it'd be a lot of work to change things, and they're right. Making a game is a lot of work, and making a game that isn't broken is a lot harder than making ship pets. Clearly, at this point we know that the devs either don't have or are not sticking to a priority list. They're building more and more features on an unstable foundation when they should just grab their assets and rewrite the core of their game. FF14 had to do it. Yeah, it'll cost money to do something right if the first five times around you messed it up, but that's hardly a good reason not to do it.    Making a good combat system in a platformer isn't hard once you've got solid physics and hit detection/resolution in - which you should have if you want your game to be fun. They can be hard to balance, and hard to build fancy unique attacks into, particularly with randomgen, but you can make decent ones with highschool level maths (and that includes the physics and hit detection). Many games use your character's butt as it's primary weapon and just bop everything to death--it's not one of the hardest parts of making a game.    What is hard is staying on task and on schedule when there are a million cool extras you want to make instead of dealing with the bugs and failed features. I feel. I'm really hoping that the new recruits to the starbound team cut the fat and get the important things done to push the game out of beta.    And I know lots of the fans don't want to rip on the bad features because they think that'll demoralize the devs and they won't get around to fixing any features, but I think we can all safely agree that the combat, as of right now, could be better. The devs think so, that's why they're working on it. In fact, I'm sure if you think about it, you really don't like how the combat works right now and are putting up with it because you like other aspects of the game.    But OP, lets be real, even if the combat currently sucks, the game isn't fast paced enough for it to warrant combat anything like Dust. Even combat like Dragon Quest II would be more appropriate. It'd be cool, but out of place."
starbound,37dtym,nerfviking,1 point,Wed May 27 09:21:59 2015 UTC,"I agree pretty much completely with your post. Like you said, the combat could be improved but it would take a lot of work.  I was actually making some observations when they released Upbeat Giraffe, and noticed something intriguing. Starbound was pretty high up in the most played game on Steam the first day it was released, but it fell considerably the second day, and continued to fall until (I think) about a week after release. Obviously, this could just be a general trend associated with a lack of interest in game over time, but it seems to me that a game that is as open-ended as Starbound should hold people's attention fairly longer.   In my honest opinion, I agree that they should probably focus a bit less on adding new things, and instead think about working on mechanics in terms of improving or fixing them. It is possible that the new items and new worldgen might only hold people's attention for a limited amount of time. Improved mechanics could hold someone's attention for a much longer amount of time, if you ask me.   And yeah, I don't like how the combat works, but I put up with it because everything else in the game is definitely above par. The environment, the music, the lore, the races, the modding abilities, and the sheer possibilities created by the game makes it easily one of the best I've ever played. But some of the mechanics reaaaaally hold the game down, and I believe it is missing out on some serious potential.  Dust's engine is primarily combat, anyways. I wasn't expecting it to get to that level, like.. ever. Honestly just a fantasy of mine to have these two games crossover."

To fix the physics they'd need to completely rip out their current physics engine and replace it with something tailored more to platforming.   There's absolutely nothing wrong with Starbound's underlying physics engine.  Platformer physics engines are dead easy, and the types of values that you're talking about adjusting (acceleration, max speed, knockback, gravity, etc) that make it easier or harder to position yourself to attack an enemy are just numbers in the code (or possibly even in the config files).  Furthermore, absolutely nothing about their existing physics engine would need a rewrite in order to code better monsters.  They already have customized monster functionality in some cases (crawling on walls, etc).  Clearly the physics engine doesn't preclude that.  On the other hand, I'm completely with you in terms of monster variety and appropriateness.  Despite the fact that they've been adding monster attack patterns and such, monsters still feel very same-y, and while I don't think an overhaul of existing code is necessary (again, there are already monsters with custom behaviors), clearly a fair amount of new code will be needed.

Furthermore, since their game is still in development, it's going to be faster if they attack sections of the code at one time, rather than focusing on a universal (but highly disparate) list of priorities.  It's also noteworthy that they already sucked it up and rewrote the codebase once, at great expense (since it involved relocating many of their devs half way across the world), and over tremendous protests of the community (ZOMG THEY'VE ABANDONED THE GAME I CAN'T SEE CHANGES COMING FAST AND FURIOUS THEY RIPPED US OFF ETC).  They've clearly demonstrated that they're willing to weather both great expense and community outrage to make the game better, so if they don't feel right now that a rewrite is necessary, I tend to trust their judgment and not idle speculation (particularly of the sort that runs contrary to my own experience developing platformers).  Now, maybe one of the devs will contradict me on this, but I'd bet you anything that if they wanted to radically alter the pace of the game, it wouldn't be necessary to rewrite the underlying engine; they'd just need to write new code for the player character and monsters, which, unlike a big rewrite, is something that could be done incrementally as opposed to all at once."
starbound,37dtym,Darkpursuer,2,Wed May 27 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"The physics engine feels like they've based it on a library for simulating real world physics rather than one for platforming, something like Box2D. I don't know what they're actually using, but that's how it comes across. That kind of thing is way fun for projectiles that knock down towers (a la Angry Birds) but frustrating for jumping from one platform to the next with precision. What they need to do is use simple mechanics that are specific to the kinds of movements players want to make.    They wouldn't have to rewrite the whole game engine, but they'd have to gut out the physics library and use a different one. Putting in new values won't solve the problem because it's the equations and calculations that need to be changed. If they've written the code modularly they only need to make a few little changes to put a new one in... but if they've mixed mayo into their ketchup bottle it's going to be hard for them to serve up anything but special sauce.    You're trusting the decision making capabilities of a development team that had written their game so badly (which also means documented badly if at all) the first time around that they need to rewrite it and didn't even get that rewrite right in major aspects like combat? To be fair to the whining community, CF promised them a lot of things, took their money above and beyond what they needed for the title (they got all their stretch goals), and still haven't delivered a finished product years after the deadline. From my own software development background, some of which has been in games, I can tell you the dev team suffers from weak leadership, inexperience, and just outright getting in over their heads. No offense to them, but it's why they're in the position they're in right now. It's not an uncommon thing to be where they are, but getting out of there requires feature cutbacks and dedication to core features. They were headed in the right direction when they reduced the complexity of the leveling system, but instead of pushing a product out they've added non-critical features here there and everywhere so they may as well have just left in their 100 tiers. Cool extras can be pushed out as patches post-release and done incrementally. A rent system is low priority. Getting the basics of movement, fighting, and digging right should be a higher priority than almost anything else because the player spends almost all their time doing those things."
starbound,37dtym,Nickleass,2,Thu May 28 02:42:04 2015 UTC,A little addition I would like to suggest is to have proper sound effects every time an attack connects. Right now every hit sounds like a whacking of a rubber bat. A sword should give a slashing sound whereas maces should give a good bashing sound. A little visual effect that differs between slash/pierce/blunt weapons would be good too.
starbound,37dtym,Aether_Storm,1 point,Wed May 27 02:10:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sure changes like that would go a long way, or would be at least a good first step in improving a (relatively) weak combat system."
starbound,37dtym,ScarsUnseen,1 point,Wed May 27 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"Has anyone heard of or played the game Nidhogg? I'm not sure how implementable a similar combat style would be, but it is epic and would make Player vs. Player Battle immensely interesting.  Especially with player-weapon cooldown time, if you swing at the same time, a parry should be possible.  This would put players with faster weapons at a distinct advantage though... what are your thoughts?"
starbound,37dtym,CrashmanX,1 point,Wed May 27 14:09:14 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with this specific suggestion is that in games like Dust, the world needs to be built around the combat. In games like Starbound, the world is built around the exploration, which overshadows combat as the largest chunk of the gameplay. The worlds would need to be made much larger and flatter, with underground combat being a death sentence if you're mining your own tunnels. Either exploration or being able to actually fight would have to suffer. But I fully agree with the notion that the combat needs to be given a proper ""style"" and made more complex."
starbound,37dtym,CrashmanX,1 point,Thu May 28 12:52:21 2015 UTC,"I had made a suggestion on the official forums once, but I guess I'll weigh in here too.    While there are a lot of things that could be done to improve combat and platforming, there are two basic things that I believe could go a long way toward making things a bit less unwieldy.   Controller support.  The very unoriginal suggestion.  Still kind of important, because of all genres, platform action games really do feel better with a controller in your hand.  Of course, there are aspects of Starbound and similar sandbox miner/builders that are much better handled with the precision of a mouse, and so I suggest... Manipulation/combat mode toggle.  Combat mode disables precision pointer targeting, and instead uses directional targeting like in traditional platformers.  It also adds a button that can be held down to lock directional facing so that you can back up like you already can normally based on where you have the pointer at on the screen.     I feel that these two additions would allow for a better feeling platformer for those that love that genre while still allowing the precision that is expected of games in the vein of Starbound and Terraria for building and mining purposes."
starbound,37dtym,CrashmanX,-2,Thu May 28 13:45:39 2015 UTC,"I believe Starbound could have the same style of combat, and has the same potential to pull it off.   I'm going to assume you don't know how the engine works, how AI programming works, or how much time goes into a system like Dust's to make it as SUPER SOLID as it is. Because to think that you can just swap combat systems between games just because they share the 2D trait, is naive at best."
starbound,37bs5w,quiqksilver,10,Tue May 26 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"This is just a simple demo and barely scratches the surface of what Tiled can do. This took just short of 2 hours of build time but I’ve compressed it down to under 30 minutes. Really looking for constructive feedback (even if it’s negative) on this kind of thing as I have never really made anything like this before.  Good questions to answer   Is this the format you would want to see this type of video in? As in, fast forwarding with intermittent commentary? Was the music annoying? I ask because it’s tough to find music without copyright claims. Would you be interested in seeing videos building other dungeons in Tiled or would you prefer to see them built in game?

Yep, pretty good. In certain cases, you could use cuts instead of fast forward, but just follow your taste.   Was the music annoying? I ask because it’s tough to find music without copyright claims.   Nope!   Would you be interested in seeing videos building other dungeons in Tiled or would you prefer to see them built in game?   Is it possible to go between the two, or is Tiled export only?   Suggestions?   If you have the time, check out what some of the Minecraft CTM map makers are doing. This work seems very similar to that, and you might be able to draw some inspiration from there."
starbound,37bs5w,nerfviking,3,Tue May 26 14:43:24 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there is no way to copy structures built in game and export them into tiled so I'd have to build exclusively in one or the other. I will definitely check out some MC CTM map makers and try to learn a few things. Thanks for the input!
starbound,37bs5w,Varixai,1 point,Tue May 26 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, just out of curiosity, is it possible to take something built in game and turn it into a micro-dungeon (or pieces of a random dungeon), or do those have to be built in an editor?  If not, then I would have to add a strong second to having the ability to export areas from existing game maps."
starbound,37bs5w,meowth_datz_rite,1 point,Tue May 26 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"No, for any structure/dungeon to be spawned in the game it has to have a PNG map (the old way) or a Tiled file (the new way).  As quiqksilver said, there is no way to export ingame built structures to Tiled, they simply have to be built in Tiled. There probably won't be a way for quite some time, if ever.. such a feature would require quite a lot of dev work to implement."
starbound,37bs5w,Varixai,1 point,Tue May 26 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"Actually it wouldn't require much work at all. Tiled has a pretty well documented and easy to use format that it saves in called TMX (which is written in XML). All you would need is a script that takes in the (x, y) of the top left and bottom right blocks of a dungeon, reads each tile on each layer of that region, and then prints those tiles in XML out to a TMX file. You might have to do some jigging if the name of the tiles are different in game than what they're called in the Tiled workspace, and maybe even after that load up the right tilesets in Tiled to get it to display correctly (depending on how the game's been set up), but it's completely doable. Like a couple of hours doable."
starbound,37bs5w,Wulf_Oman,10,Wed May 27 12:55:44 2015 UTC,"To all those asking if Tiled is only available to devs, and if so when can it be released to the masses.. here is the related discussion on IRC: http://pastebin.com/6zCXBSXJ (metadept is a dev)  The short answer is: Yes, Tiled is only for devs right now. It uses some scripts that are not public yet and hooks into some things that are also not public yet. It is a little too complicated still for general release, requiring a lot of setup that can easily go wrong.  It is being worked on though, and we'll hopefully get a public release within a couple months. /u/Tiyuri very much wants us to be able to make our own missions."

But I think you should follow the style that's most comfortable for you.  The music was good, just keep it in that light ambient electronic style and I'm sure it'll fit.  I like the sneak peek your access to tiled provides :)  Now I have my own if you don't mind! How much is involved in your pre-planning process? You seem to work very purposefully yet with a lot of intuitive adjustments."
starbound,37bs5w,Sir_Cuitry,2,Tue May 26 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"I will gladly answer any questions. Thank you for the input, I will take all of it into consideration in my future videos.    When I plan out a dungeon I typically have an idea for the type of dungeon I want it to be. This could be platforming, puzzles, combat, etc. With that in mind I then come up with a few obstacles/traps and designate locations to determine how the map will flow. Once I have the general map plan in my head, I do make lots of adjustments on the fly. One of the hardest adjustments I have had to make in Tiled is trying to recognize how far/high a player can jump at varying height levels while looking at the map in Tiled. Sometimes you think ""that doesn't look that far, I can make that easily"" then you go test it out and you are not even close. The same applies to how fast the player can run in a blocks-per-second format when using timers to make traps pop up. Hopefully that answers your question. =)"
starbound,37bs5w,Sir_Cuitry,2,Tue May 26 20:11:32 2015 UTC,"Indeed thanks! Tiled looks a bit rough for play testing at the moment, I hope they do good work on it's ease of access for both your sake and the community's :)"
starbound,37bs5w,Sir_Cuitry,2,Tue May 26 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"This is great. I keep being disappointed by CF's constraints though. I mean, what's the point in getting techs if there aren't opportunities where we need to use them?"
starbound,37bs5w,Sir_Cuitry,3,Tue May 26 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"Don't get too caught up on the tech constraints right now. From the chats I have had with the team, there are some major changes coming in that area. =)"
starbound,37bs5w,Wulf_Oman,2,Tue May 26 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"Awesome. If this isn't already in the works, having a tech-swap station at the beginning of a tech-enabled dungeon might be a good idea!"
starbound,37bs5w,sayterdarkwynd,2,Tue May 26 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"It's going to be interesting how they handle it long term. Some techs completely break all aspects of dungeons, like Rocket Boots and Blink. The only solution I can see is to either disable tech in dungeons or mention on the outside that certain techs are required. Even then, there is nothing stopping anyone with rockets boots from just cheesing the dungeon unless you just disable tech."
starbound,37bs5w,sayterdarkwynd,2,Tue May 26 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would prefer not to have a spoiler for which techs are required. I think it would be cool to have a dungeon where you need to stand on a switch and blink past a door to proceed. Maybe a notification that just says ""this dungeon requires techs"", without specifying which ones. Just leave it up to the player to figure it out as a puzzle.  I could have sworn I saw a gif (that maybe even you made?) of a blink proof passage way involving lava. Can't find it now though. I guess you could prevent blink by having the entrance require morphball. Rocket boost is a little harder since it basically obsoletes everything before it.  I guess one idea would just be to have no-tech dungeons have lower-tier rewards than the tech ones. That way anyone with blink and rocket boost has no incentive to go through them, and instead needs to do dungeons which are challenging even with those techs."
starbound,37bs5w,Shadow0X90,3,Tue May 26 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"I did make a blink-proof lock haha but I don't think that will be the solution. Blink is really really overpowered as it is. I honestly think it needs a huge nerf. It makes it so spacing isn't a thing and eliminates any long range roles, plus already destroys any aspect of platforming. It hurts the game more than it helps it. My hope is it gets a huge range nerf and a bigger energy requirement."

Effectively a character (ship) can move items and objects between servers.  As to move your entire universe to the server, support for that is up to the provider, but basically you have to replace the universe directory of the server with yours.

starbound,37fbwc,TomCatFort,3,Wed May 27 06:46:12 2015 UTC,"The folder that holds all the universe files is appropriately named ""universe"" and to find it go to your main Starbound install folder and open up the ""giraffe_storage"" folder and you will see ""universe"" in there.  If the server you buy allows you to change files on the server you will be able to move the files in that ""universe"" folder over into the server's ""universe"" folder (make sure that your files are the only ones in the server's ""universe"" folder otherwise things may be wonky). Obviously you need to send over the files from your friend's computer that runs the server :P  Have you ever transferred files over to a server before?

All you have to do is copy/paste this into chat while in admin mode with the armor you want and pick a color index number for the color you want.  code  /spawnitem simplecapeback 1 '{""colorIndex"":9}'  It has a few limitations but works for the most part. If you want more details I made a video on the topic showcasing a lot of its applications and quirks.

Assuming you are playing single player, do whatever the heck you want. It's your game and your freetime so you should spend it doing whatever you want however you want. If you want a mod that allows you to compact coal into diamonds so you can build a swimming pool with liquid diamond water, go ahead. Especially in a sandbox game like Starbound.  I'm a really casual player so I mod or adjust my games to be easier all the time. For example, I just got the entire Skyrim game for real cheap on a sale a few days ago but I don't like stressing about whether or not a giant spider is going to jump out of the trees and eat me, so I game myself unlimited health so that I can just stand there and hack at the spider until it dies :P My enjoyment of the game has gone up immeasurably now that I don't have to quicksave all the time and reload whenever I die :P"

starbound,375p63,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Mon May 25 03:10:53 2015 UTC,Adding this might also fix the issue with enemy AI not backing up when you get too close and simply shooting past you. If you get that close then they hit you back and can keep shooting. Might give combat a bit of an edge to it or I'm dreaming too hard. Interesting thought.
starbound,375p63,ICDeadPixels,1 point,Mon May 25 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd like to see some melee secondaries for some guns (similar to current variable secondary attacks for melee weapons). It wouldn't be too hard to imagine stabbing with a bayonet of some sort, or sweeping a short, tight plasma flame in an arc like a blade. All that would really be required is matching the potential damage type to the weapon's fire type and model, and implementing the same secondary attack rules as melee weapons (no items in the other hand)."

Either you HAD a mod that added that weather type, or they have removed the weather type and the planet already generated with it.   Two solutions exist:  One, travel to a new sector of space entirely (scroll till it says Processing and no other stars are visible) so that it generates new worlds without said weather type. Or, delete your /universe folder contents (but be aware that any planet youve built stuff on will be gone, so backup your shit)."

starbound,374n94,xupti,3,Sun May 24 21:01:30 2015 UTC,Honestly the small nitpicks like this is what bothers me in a game the most (for some reason)
starbound,374n94,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Mon May 25 01:22:47 2015 UTC,Scouter should cost 9001 pixels to produce.
starbound,375ozt,crazycarl444,17,Mon May 25 02:34:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pickaxes and drills got nerfed because matter manipulators got a huge buff. You should use the MM as your main mining tool and use picks as ""supplements"" for dealing with really tough materials like obsidian or Outpost walls."
starbound,375ozt,Observance,5,Mon May 25 02:42:46 2015 UTC,You'll want to stick with the matter manipulator for just about everything. If you find a pickaxe that seems faster than your current matter manipulator feel free to just use it up. They drop all over but wear down very fast (and no repairing them).    Refer to the wiki if you need help on anything at all.
starbound,375ozt,Varixai,3,Mon May 25 03:35:27 2015 UTC,Don't worry too much. The MM is not the main tool in the game with the others being there only to help in maybe otherwise too difficult ores or materials that you find. The new MM is much better than the other tools ever were.  The starter planet also features a special sub-biome that allows you to go pretty deep underground with minimal (somtimes no) digging at all. As long as you keep following these caves deeper down you're bound to find some copper for an upgrade.   Personally I didn't use pickaxes that much except in the begging to dig out the core fragment and later on drills to dig obsidian. Other than that the MM is markedly better.

starbound,375ozt,celade,1 point,Wed May 27 04:14:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is CF made it impossible to play mod-free for people who preferred non-punishing and/or sandbox gameplay.  Just now Nightly has got rid of two liquid object definitions, which tons of mods were depend upon. It might not look bad from the ""vanilla"" gameplay perspective. At first. Until you'll remember how the Flesh biome looked like in EK. Now it's a clashing colour mess of elements which are just thrown together (red flesh blocks, light-blue ""grass"" and pools of poison).  From the modder's perspective, however, this will bring patching hell - every mod which was using the removed liquids will re-implement it back in. The result? All these mods will clash and no longer work together, unless their authors will cooperate to depend on each other."
starbound,375ozt,dsp2003,1 point,Wed May 27 05:49:27 2015 UTC,"Trying to have mods work with nightly builds is an exercise in futility in the first place.

starbound,375ozt,onetrueping,2,Wed May 27 09:44:21 2015 UTC,"You don't understand. All these changes will be eventually pushed to Stable, and then - welcome to patching hell, mark my words. You don't change something global in a span of one minor code version without horrid consequences. Even M$ understands it. CF? Nope."
starbound,375ozt,dsp2003,1 point,Wed May 27 09:46:51 2015 UTC,"Name a single game that didn't break mods with every major patch. It comes down to one simple fact of application development: in a choice between a better product and a more compatible product, the better product is the better choice. If removing two global variables improves the game in a dramatic enough fashion, the change is far preferable to keeping compatibility with third-party applications. Further, by making the changes available in the nightly builds, and announcing when the changes go live, Chucklefish are doing more than most companies to ensure that modders have access to the most recent code.  In short, what is inconvenient for you, personally, is, in this case, more convenient for both Chucklefish, the modding community, and players of the stable game builds."
starbound,375ozt,onetrueping,-12,Wed May 27 09:55:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think CF fucked up things as regards to pickaxes.  The game doesn't know what way it wants to go now.  Pickaxes are better diggers, but guess what?  You need to dig your ass off to find ore to make axes.  And the initial MM's are so pathetically slow it's just infuriating to play.  Now, every time, I just go into /admin mode and upgrade the MM to max and get on with playing the game.  CF has really goofed things up here."

starbound,3744od,leisuretown,2,Sun May 24 19:48:13 2015 UTC,You'd need to edit the config file manually.
starbound,3744od,dgmdavid,0,Sun May 24 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"We already talked about this, but this shouldn't be needed. What's wrong about allowing the DEL key (and also ENTER/RETURN doesn't seem to work too) to be set? I know it's ""the key to delete a key binding"" but what's wrong with limiting it to just clicking on the trashcan? If it's just ""because I want it to"" or ""because I don't want spend more time on this feature"", then it's just lame.  edit: What I really meant: It isn't even a ""game design"" decision/choise, and it was brought up several times on this subrredit alone because people actually want to use the DEL key."
starbound,3744od,dgmdavid,0,Mon May 25 06:58:26 2015 UTC,"It was an intentional design decision to make ESC and Del not Bindable from the GUI. It's not as like Starbound is unique in this respect. Most games I surveyed while designing this don't let you bind Del or ESC for the same reason. So I conformed with the found norms. Principle of least surprise.  I'm sorry you find it inconvenient, but without a more compelling reason than a handful of people complaining, it's not going to be changed, because literally every design decision we make has people telling us how dumb it is (no matter what it is).  Again, if on the off chance that you actually want to bind these keys, the config file is human editable.  And I'd rather inconvenience whatever small fraction of people want to bind Del, rather than the majority of people who expect Del to work as it currently does."
starbound,3744od,OmnipotentEntity,1 point,Mon May 25 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"I've never encountered a game other than Starbound that doesn't let you bind DEL.

starbound,3744od,leisuretown,2,Sat May 30 19:03:09 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I do. The only games that doesn't let me bind the Del key are the games that do not have rebindable keys. And Starbound.
starbound,3744od,dgmdavid,1 point,Sat May 30 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every game with rebindable keys that I played allows DEL to be bindable, so I doubt your research.

Just another dumb internet person.  edit: what I really meant: I always rebind keys when possible, and I never came across a game that wouldn't let me use the DEL key, except Starbound. So, drop the act. Don't say it like it is a internacional consensus, just say you guys want this way and it's done. Saying it's a research and the sample of two linux games that you tested is the universal rule is just dumb."

starbound,3703g1,Klemen702,3,Sun May 24 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"Florans don't use pronouns in translated speech, instead using species, personal name, or some descriptor. Doesn't widespread difficulty with pronouns of all sorts indicate they aren't used to them, and probably don't have them at all in their native language(s)?"
starbound,3703g1,Mortagon,0,Sat May 23 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"If the universal translator refuses to translate Floran dialogue into non-broken English, it's likely because somebody wanted to make Florans sound idiotic. Pronouns would absolutely have a use in Floran society, as far as I can tell."
starbound,3703g1,TheDiscordedSnarl,3,Sat May 23 22:42:19 2015 UTC,"Do you have a particular reason to think that? Isn't it just a simpler explanation if Floran language doesn't use pronouns, rather than assuming the translator is wrong? It wouldn't be that strange. They also don't use the verb 'be', by the way, which is perfectly normal. Plenty of languages like that.  Edit: I should specify that I'm referring to pronouns as exist in English. There are languages with pronouns as an open class, as I'm suggesting might be the case in a Floran language, in which any noun phrase referring to a person can be used as a pronoun."
starbound,3703g1,Observance,2,Sat May 23 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"It's just a personal preference of mine that since Florans speak a completely alien language (just as other races would speak a completely alien language), all other races having their dialogue translated into perfect English indicates that the translator isn't simply blindly translating words. It goes to follow that since Florans have their language translated horrendously, it is likely on purpose.  Open pronouns are perfectly acceptable; the five-pronoun system currently in place is just a hypothetical that I believe closer fits how social standing works in Floran society.  Pronouns in translated Floran are seen in several cases here, and here (him - although gender does not exist). Further examples can be observed in The Art of Stabbing further down the list, although it could be potentially that the more intellectual a Floran, the less broken the translation is, as can be noted by the perfect English in A Greenguard's Journal. (Or it could just be a stylistic choice by the devs to communicate intellectuality but shhhh)"

Yesterday I was away from my main computer and wanted to play starbound so I sent my player files over to the new computer so I could play with my character. My friend wanted me to give him some coffee, so I did, but afterwards I stopped playing on the new computer.

starbound,36wlaj,dweeceman,7,Fri May 22 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"Yes it is on the Nightly. As for when:    At least 2 more weeks until Unstable, and at least 3 weeks until Stable.    Dev quote on IRC:   May 13 1:37:11 <GXyon> Do we have an ETA when the next Stable patch is going to be? May 13 1:37:38 <metadept> 1-3 months probably May 13 1:37:47 <metadept> not soon     It depends on how much they want to cram into that update and how many issues they run into on the way. For example, the combat overhaul is the main focus of the update, but they are also working on colonies, selling, challenge rooms, and the Avian mission. (Also finishing the Floran mission with Nuru and Ixodoom, but that's nearly done)  If you want to watch their progress more closely you can follow the nightly patch notes on the wiki and Kawa's direct nightly change log. (Plus I usually post updates on each dev blog thread, and /u/quiqksilver also details cool upcoming features.)"

starbound,36wlaj,Whilyam,12,Sat May 23 06:24:44 2015 UTC,"I would LOVE to see the ""BUY"" interface look like the ""SELL"" interface, just have it give you a description when you hover over the item."
starbound,36wlaj,Pixelnator,4,Fri May 22 19:09:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. It would be great on crafting windows too. No more endless scrolling or cumbersome search box-ing to find the magic pea mush recipe.
starbound,36wlaj,SupaSlide,1 point,Fri May 22 21:17:40 2015 UTC,Yeah sadly the list-based interface is one of the clunkiest interfaces in Starbound at the moment. It does a horrible job at presenting the information you want and a really good job at wasting a ton of space and hiding everything amongst irrelevant stuff.  I know the search is there but it assumes you know the name of what you're searching for. Plus it means I have to let go of the mouse and start typing stuff which is a hassle.  Something like this might be better (minus the inventory Tetris aspect). As annoying as it might be from a design perspective I think completely reworking the list-based interface is called for. It just isn't that good.
starbound,36wlaj,Pixelnator,2,Sat May 23 10:58:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about changing the buy/craft menu to look like the sell menu. The little inventory icons don't do a lot of items justice. I would have to go checking what each unknown icon is just to figure it out, still causing me to poke around the whole menu anyway.  I think the menus for buy/crafting are fine, I use the little sorting option to choose between food or furniture or weapons and I can easily find what I'm looking for even without knowing the name.  The only way I think an inventory like menu would work is if it used larger icons of things, the small ones are just too small unless you already know what they are."
starbound,36wlaj,SupaSlide,2,Sun May 24 11:43:57 2015 UTC,"6-7 objects simultaneously visible isn't enough in my opinion. Especially if you have something like a robotics crafting table that has a huge list of recipes. Making it it so that you can toggle between the list and compact view would be one option but as it stands I feel like the list menu is restrictive.   The little inventory icons don't do a lot of items justice. I would have to go checking what each unknown icon is just to figure it out, still causing me to poke around the whole menu anyway.   Once you know what each item is the icons are informative enough and additional information would be presented while hovering over the object anyways (just like it does in an inventory screen).  At the very least let us stretch and resize the menus. I have enough screen space to make the menus larger and they really should act more like windows to begin with. Again, programming it would be a task and you'd have to make sure all the art assets work with it but it'd be a big improvement on menu interaction. Hell, Reddit lets me resize this textbox to accomodate this giant wall of text better as I'm writing it. We should be able to do the same with menus and the chatbox in-game without having to resort to mods."
starbound,36wlaj,matheod,1 point,Sun May 24 12:08:20 2015 UTC,"Hell, Reddit lets me resize this textbox to accomodate this giant wall of text better as I'm writing it.   Resizing a textbox is a native html thing that Reddit had nothing to do with, but I get your point.  Like I said, having an option to change UI size would be great, and resizing like you said would obviously be the most intuitive and convenient way to change UI size. I'm all for being able to resize the UI, I just think making the icons for what you can craft/buy so small is going to make it inconvenient, especially when the icon doesn't really look like the object you want. Not to mention how small they would which is sort of counter intuitive to what you're saying, considering you are also saying how small the UI is already.  EDIT: I would love the idea of just seeing the icons like you are suggesting, but I would want instead to have the ""icons"" take up a little more space and show the actual object."
starbound,36wlaj,Pixelnator,2,Sun May 24 12:45:05 2015 UTC,Well there should be a button to switch to a compact UI (i.e; like sell). I think keeping both is better.

starbound,36wlaj,Fozziee,1 point,Sat May 23 06:25:53 2015 UTC,"If the UI were any bigger I wouldn't be able to see a lot of my game, and I have a decent screen size (1366x768).  I think part of the reason is that the game doesn't pause when you open an inventory or trading menu. It is possible to open a menu and then get attacked by a monster, and having the smaller menus means it is easier to see where you are getting attacked from.  It also means you can still play while using the inventory menu for example. I often have an item in my inventory I just want to place down quickly so I just open my inventory, select it, and set it down without ever having to leave my inventory screen.  Something like UI size should definitely be an option though, I imagine on a large screen that it can be very hard to see."

For now I'm working with longer pulses, but I figured out a better way to add edge protection to my 3-gate setup: If you want a positive-only pulse, you wire the switch output to a NOT gate, and wire that NOT output to the other NOT input (the one already connected to the XOR). Or if you want a negative-only pulse, even easier, just wire the switch output directly to the existing NOT gate... I might make a tutorial of some of these useful setups at some point, for people who failed out of circuits in college like me. :)"

Some friendly tips/comments:   I think the spiderboss needs a back wall to spawn, since he walks on it, but they may have disabled him spawning like you said. Really though, he's best seen in his room in the floran mission, he has a lot of mechanics based on the room now. (cocoon for one) There are several wing items that you can spawn, you just have to include "".png"" as part of the item name.. that was a typo on CF's part. I include the spawn names in the album I linked previously. The overall video volume could be a little higher, had to max my settings out to hear it over very light noise on my end. I love that you went through your own challenge room. I think once they start getting a little more complex it would be cool to hear some of your thoughts behind the design as you're going through it. Like, the different skills you're trying to get the player to rely on. Remember now you have true access to all the enemies. Would be cool to start seeing those in challenge rooms. I wonder if you could get clearance on some of the as yet unseen ones like Allergen? You could also use some others in unique ways, like having a Shockhopper Mk 1 missile shooting out of a wall alcove. :D"
starbound,36w5rq,Varixai,1 point,Sat May 23 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure about the spider boss or his minions. They spawned in fine with no back ground just a few days ago. Odd to say the least. The wings thing threw me off bad haha thanks for letting me know what the deal was. Also, do I need a mod to spawn them in with a color? If not how would the command string look? The volume is a huge issue right now for me and I have been working on figuring out what the deal is. Youtube is adjusting my sound when it uploads for some reason, making it quieter. Next upload I am going to try to boost the volume considerably before uploading to see if that remedies the problem. I plan on doing just that with several dungeons once I get a few made. =) I would love to use a ton of crazy stuff, but I have some pretty stiff rules I have to follow. For instance, I can only use random monsters or NPC bandits. Also, all of my jump platforms must be at least 4 blocks wide, so no super narrow platforms allowed. I am also limited to only using the ancient themed pallet. I have put in a lot of requests for ancient items to work with and we are just now starting to see some of them(ancient trapdoor, boosters, etc). Doors, buttons and a few other really unique items will be coming soon that are all ancient themed."

The number vs color table is on the wiki page.    I did eventually figure out how to do full on custom colors, but it's pretty complicated. You have to do a long JSON string where you replace each default color hex code with one of your own.

I have only scratched the surface in my testing of it, but it seems to be touchy with back items and a couple armors. Really the more custom the item the less chance of it being recolor-able. So the crafted tier armor works well, but a lot of the vanity stuff just has hardcoded colors or whatever.  Example: The Terrifying Wings on stable I can't recolor, but all those new green ones I can recolor, since they haven't specified their colors yet or something."

starbound,36w5rq,Mackinz,8,Fri May 22 21:23:22 2015 UTC,"So I'm hoping that you can still get MM upgrades and tech drives through normal progression? They're both pretty important parts of the gameplay so I don't want them to be solely found by chance.  Edit: Looks like Supernorn already sorta addressed this in the forum:   You can still find regular tech drives in the world and also receive them as quest rewards etc. This just allows you to craft them yourself through regular exploration.  Changing the manipulator upgrade requirements from ever increasing tiered ores to an item you can find in the world at every tier is also a better change.  You'll still be able to find the wooden chests in certain biomes, for those who were asking.   So at least tech drives will still be quest rewards, but I'm hoping that MM upgrades will work the same way. It would suck to play the game for hours and never find a MM upgrade. However this could be less of an issue if they improve the loot system substantially so you get useful stuff like this rather than a bandage and three logs."

Same doors marked with I,II,III, IV, and so on until the party cap limit. Door only opens if either   A: party Size equals that of door number.  or  B: Players in the same party that are near the door equals the number on the door.   Once the landing zone is clear another group of players may enter, even if they were in the same party as group 1 it just uses a separate instance. (or only 1 group at a time)   additionally add doors that are super challenging and have a lobby after entering that say so and allow exit.  additionally add doors with a lobby that allow instant exit that warn players they will not be able to play this door again after they die whike inside. but the reward would be rare/greater. think rare cosmetics or neat recipies or somthing.

starbound,36rfi9,manchete,2,Thu May 21 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"Prisoner's dilemma:       The prisoner's dilemma is a canonical example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two purely ""rational"" individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests [citation needed] to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and gave it the name ""prisoner's dilemma"" (Poundstone, 1992), presenting it as follows:   Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The prosecutors do not have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They hope to get both sentenced to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to: betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. Here is the offer:    If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison (and vice versa) If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge)   It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get, and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with him, all purely rational self-interested prisoners would betray the other, and so the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray, when they would get a better reward if they both cooperated. In reality, humans display a systematic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games, much more so than predicted by simple models of ""rational"" self-interested action.     A model based on a different kind of rationality, where people forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they maximize their forecasts, has been shown to make better predictions of the rate of cooperation in this and similar games given only the payoffs of the game.   There is also an extended ""iterated"" version of the game, where the classic game is played over and over between the same prisoners, and consequently, both prisoners continuously have an opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by backward induction) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms.  The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many real world situations involving cooperative behaviour. In casual usage, the label ""prisoner's dilemma"" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it merely difficult or expensive, not necessarily impossible, to coordinate their activities to achieve cooperation.

starbound,36uzbf,quiqksilver,5,Fri May 22 15:51:24 2015 UTC,That's my new dungeon lol first one haha it's not anything crazy. More of a sample to make sure I'm proficient enough with tiled to make complex ones.
starbound,36ril8,tmc_ThatMadCat,10,Thu May 21 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"Love it, very nice. I like the realism in it, with the penthouse suites and rooftop pool.  For the colony deeds, I think you should start prototyping a building with many different styles built in.    Right now almost that entire building would have the same exact tenant types. And while that would still make you rich, I think it would be pretty cool to have a more diverse population that gives you a whole bunch of different rewards."
starbound,36ril8,Varixai,7,Thu May 21 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Originally, my idea was to start with a basic design, and elaborate from there. I know this building would almost exclusively attract human tenants, so when the colony deeds get put up, I can start changing styles and trying to attract lots of different tenants."
starbound,36ril8,Kra_gl_e,5,Thu May 21 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"I kinda like the unified 'theme' from a purely aesthetic standpoint though, it looks like the generic RL apartment building. Perhaps you could experiment with implementing 'blocks' in the design to balance diversity with visual coherence. Maybe you could even try having multiple apartments per block."
starbound,36ril8,Kra_gl_e,4,Thu May 21 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"If only I'd have thought of that before i started building it... that'd have been a much better idea!  I really like the blocks idea, do you think it would work with similar styled apartment buildings utilising similar interior aspects, or would that just be like a building copy/paste? Or would the similar style buildings with different interiors be a more acceptable approach?"
starbound,36ril8,HobbitFoot,3,Thu May 21 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.... now that I think about it, if you had a real apartment, you would be basically free to decorate your apartment however you like, but the basic structure of each suite is more or less the same. So for example, each house could look something like:    {[entrance][kitchen][bathroom][bedroom]}   Or however you want to do it, and have the same basic furniture, just arranged differently and of different styles. Whether you want to vary the background walls of the apartments is up to you (or may depend on how colony deeds end up working). So a floor could look something like:  {[bedroom][bathroom][kitchen][entry]}{corridor}{[entry][kitchen][bathroom][bedroom]}   Any common areas like the corridor would all have the same look of course."
starbound,36ril8,n4th0s,3,Fri May 22 00:08:57 2015 UTC,"I see, I'll definitely have to try making a much wider building to accomodate the second 'block' idea you mentioned. But I will definitely try that!  I based the layouts themselves on the TV show Friends, where the front door leads straight into the kitchen, and then there is the living room. However I didn't want people to have to walk through the bathrooms to get to anywhere, so I re-ordered the layout to bedroom then bathroom. (I also admit that I made the apartments a lot smaller than I had anticipated when building them, hence the rather crowded spaces)"
starbound,36ril8,DoctorZero,6,Fri May 22 11:51:09 2015 UTC,This brings memories of SimTower.

starbound,36ril8,TacoRalf,4,Thu May 21 15:34:04 2015 UTC,Alas I'm not. I'm trying to get a planet mostly built before I put deeds in the houses and such!
starbound,36ril8,justbeast,5,Thu May 21 15:36:25 2015 UTC,You should definitely do a followup post with a tour of your planet after the deeds come to stable. It'd be neat to see :)

I've started to build a base on an asteroid and it is a bit more difficult because some asteroids are big and some are small and I'll have to make bridges to each of them. Just some suggestions.

starbound,36sp6a,Darkpursuer,1 point,Fri May 22 01:49:47 2015 UTC,"Do you mean CSS? You mention the banner so I'm assuming you mean the subreddit style, or maybe just the banner?  As for changing the banner.. there's not too much that would work, since the height is so tiny. Any image of terrain would have to be reduced in size until it was just blobs of dirt. Otherwise it would just be a relatively flat grassy spot.  A village too, unless you mean a mini village. Any player built structure or village would be reduced to a couple pixels per building."
starbound,36sp6a,Varixai,2,Thu May 21 20:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i meant CSS, as for the banner, i'm pretty sure the size is changable, right?

starbound,36pcpu,Frosty_Flakes,2,Thu May 21 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"I really feel like city planets with quests to embark on a mission to infiltrate a homeland on another planet would be as good as it gets, with rare drops specific to the area.   What about a side quest where you have to find an npc on a planet, who knows where on the planet, he could be an explorer that you're looking for.  Special tech rewards?"
starbound,36pcpu,Voyageroftime,1 point,Thu May 21 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"That's similar to what I was thinking. Searching for other NPCs would be a good premise for certain quests. Perhaps bounty hunting for escaped fugitives.  Tech rewards would be good. I think that tech chests should be more rare, so more value is placed in the quests rather than stumbling upon random tech chests on planets. Other rewards could be blueprints, special items, or coordinates to unique planets."
starbound,36pcpu,popability,1 point,Thu May 21 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind some fetchquests, provided they helped increase your standing with a particular faction. Or maybe just the faction on that planet.  This could tie in to harder, more rewarding quests, by making them available only if you have high enough standing with that faction. That way you don't feel obliged to do all random fetchquests because you're not getting stuff from them, you get to pick who you want to help and improve relations with.  I like your city idea. Is it really possible for someone to stumble upon a random quest planet out of order? I'd think the odds against that to be extremely high. How you dealt with it sounds ok with me.  Might I suggest being able to abandon missions, i.e. voluntarily fail them? Give you a ding against your rep with that faction, but it might not be a bad idea to quit if that particular mission would give you more trouble than it's worth, e.g. if it would lower your standing with a different faction you're also cultivating."
starbound,36me9y,quiqksilver,53,Wed May 20 13:22:10 2015 UTC,I made these two examples using the new Jump Pad item. It's a new nightly item that launches the player and acts as an elevator type item. However it has many unique quirks to it. If you are interested in learning about them I made a short video detailing some of the weird mechanics they have. They also essentially replace Skyrails as you can do nearly everything they can without the need for the tech.

Actually, here's an example that might help:  You enter a USCM Prison, which has a shield generator at the top of one of the buildings. This shield makes it so that you can't destroy the walls of the prison or gather the objects inside of it.  While in the prison, type /debug. (You have to be in admin mode, see wiki page) Now look in the top left, one of the lines says DungeonID, let's say it says 1897. Now type /settileprotection 1897 0. Now the prison is no longer protected. Type the same thing with 1 instead of 0 to turn the protection back on."

starbound,36s452,Varixai,1 point,Thu May 21 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"It requires a dungeon ID to work. Dungeon means something very specific in the game's code/assets.  So no, sadly it will not work on player made ""dungeons"". It also does not work on the premade missions like the lunar base mission, because those do not have a dungeon ID.  If you build inside of an area that has a dungeon ID though, then yes it should still work within that area after you alter it."

Motion sensors, LADAR, etc. Combine it with basic outline maps for areas you've previously visited but cannot currently see, and you've got a far more interesting visual game.  For additional fun, include a blacklight backpack. Makes certain colors and substances glow bright colors, while doing a soft purple lighting!

starbound,36i4vp,quiqksilver,7,Tue May 19 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Prison beds, ho!!!"
starbound,36i4vp,defiler86,4,Tue May 19 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, most of the requirements so far are very simple, since they are just starting to build out the system. They added several more NPCs yesterday though, with a lot more to come.      Keep an eye on the Colony Deed wiki page. It already lists the requirements for the first couple NPCs, and it will keep getting updated as more NPCs get added.    Edit: Remember many NPCs will need some racial objects. The glitch follower for example needs 3 glitch items in the room."

starbound,36i4vp,Tidus17,1 point,Tue May 19 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"So basically as complex of a house as Terraria asked for?  Great! I was dreading it went with the minecraft way, like asking for sunlight outside, preventing you from making villages in the nether or underground."
starbound,36i4vp,runetrantor,5,Wed May 20 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"Afternoon!  Supernorn has gone ahead and improved the colonization deeds and was kind enough to make a few gifs showing the different rental states. Gifs are big, so hit the ‘read more’ link to see them. :D  Collectin’ the rent!  Summoning a tenant!  Making repairs!  See you tomorrow! <3   posted by mollygos"
starbound,36i4vp,SupaSlide,7,Thu May 21 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"So... what I would really like to see from colonization is colonists that can do mining (and farming). Having them dig a shaft with platforms every 3 tiles, and then branching tunnels... and bringing the recovered ore back the surface... that would be super cool."
starbound,36i4vp,Sir_Cuitry,2,Tue May 19 17:11:40 2015 UTC,Like Terraria meets DwarfFortress? I like that.
starbound,36i4vp,GregTheMad,3,Tue May 19 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"So, the colonization was mentioned with endgame in the linked post; does this mean that you will only be able to colonize and create towns for profit in endgame?  I am asking specifically in regard to the idea that combat would not be the only way to progress through the game.  There were suggestions that farming or just mining could be potential options to carry a player through to endgame, even if they didn't want to fight bosses."
starbound,36i4vp,EquipLordBritish,7,Wed May 20 10:50:33 2015 UTC,"It will not be endgame only. It will be available right from the start. They have always planned to have many different paths to endgame. This is the builder path, there will also be a farming path, and a more traditional exploration/combat path."

starbound,36i4vp,Sir_Cuitry,7,Wed May 20 10:53:57 2015 UTC,"Seriously? I am super excited about colonies! Finding towns is fun, but making your towns and forts will be amazing.   Chucklefish said that they plan on having many ways to advance the story, including building (colonies), farming (TBA), and combat (dungeons)."
starbound,36i4vp,Roarkewa,2,Tue May 19 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"I am excited about the idea of colonies, but making the incentive to build them ""click a button to receive cash"" is very mobile-game.  Since I probably shouldn't complain without providing an alternative... increasing the size of your colony could increase the level of goods available from its merchants."
starbound,36i4vp,Sir_Cuitry,9,Tue May 19 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"From the original colonization overview post:   Once NPCs move in they’ll offer all sorts of different benefits. Some NPCs will sell unique items, some will defend the town, some will offer quests and others will place new unique objects in their home like new crafting tables or facilities. Sometimes you’ll only be able to attract an NPC using items a previous NPC has given you, allowing for colony progression. Sometimes you’ll need objects from a unique dungeon or sub biome to attract particularly rare NPCs. For example, obtaining all the blueprints for slime furniture from the slime biome, crafting it and using it to decorate a house will cause a slime creature to move into your colony and in turn sell you a unique weapon.   tl;dr - Yes, there will be many more benefits besides rent."
starbound,36i4vp,Varixai,2,Tue May 19 17:52:59 2015 UTC,Any chance we could just collect from the AI terminal?   I agree - insofar as having a planet-wide or even system-wide collection.  Collecting monetary gains on a property-by-property basis smacks too much of GTA.

starbound,36oyx9,DIGBUILDHELP135,2,Wed May 20 23:54:31 2015 UTC,"Well, one would think that a subreddit needs a purpose to exist. Maybe even a description of what it is for? What commands are you referring to? These ones?     http://starbounder.org/Commands   Going through your comment history, maybe you are talking about something similar to /r/MinecraftCommands? If that is the case, then Starbound does not have ""commands"" or ""command blocks"" in the same way Minecraft does, therefore there is no reason to have a subreddit devoted to them.  Perhaps you are looking for wiring, which starbound does have.

If that runs slowly you can try the others but they probably won't help.  If your computer is NOT 64-bit then you should try both versions, it depends on how good your graphics card is and how fast it can calculate OpenGL stuff vs whatever they use in the non-OpenGL version.  Obviously the server button is only if you are hosting a server, and since you haven't even figured out which button you should use to start playing the game, you probably shouldn't be running a server yet.

I looked at the game's error log, and it mentioned that it couldnt read the .player and the .metadata files due to file corruption. (And so, the character just didn't even show up in the menu.) One of the backups, though (.bak1, for the player and metadata files respectively) turned out to be valid. So I renamed the backup file to the actual one (so, 'blah.player.bak1' to 'blah.player', and same for metadata, both in 'giraffe_storage/player' folder). And the character re-appeared. I lost some minutes of progress, since the backup was taken, but was still crazy-relieved."

starbound,36edh4,MengskDidNothinWrong,3,Mon May 18 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"In the server config file, there's a key gameServerPort; that's your local port, default is 21025. (You may have to open it in your computer's firewall [if you get asked, it's a TCP port, not UDP.]) If you have e.g. the LAN IP 10.0.0.1, anyone inside the LAN can connect to that IP using the port, and it's no problem if the packets go through the router, because it's not outbound.  There's also a key upnpPortForwarding, set that to false. UPnP is a protocol that, among other things, allows hosts in a LAN to create a port forward on the router without manually modifying the router's config. You don't want that in your case."
starbound,36edh4,SCPH-0815,1 point,Mon May 18 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"I know this is 29 days late, but could you explain UPnP to me like I'm a child? I've always manually port-forwarded, and don't understand the magic of UPnP. Terraria supposedly has it, but I don't know how to tell if it works."
starbound,36edh4,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:28:52 2015 UTC,"I can try.  UPnP is a technology that allows devices inside an IP-based network to find each other and communicate via well-known interfaces/protocols. A new device will register itself and make itself known to everyone else (with a so-called multicast -- anyone inside a network can subscribe to a multicast address [these addresses are standardised], and when someone sends packets to that address, every subscriber will receive ""a copy"" of the packets). Along with that, it will tell everyone what protocols and roles it offers. It will also tell about its capabilities if asked by another device.  One such protocol is the IGD, the Internet Gateway Device protocol, most commonly implemented by NAT routers (i.e. almost every household router out there). Using this protocol, a device on the network can, among other tasks, create/alter/delete port forwarding rules.  Other UPnP protocols are used to share files, play music, and so on, basically the devices can control each other to a small extent.  Most OS offer UPnP functionality these days and any program can use it, so an application can ask the OS to find a router that supports IGD, then if such a device is found, ask that device to open port XYZ. Upon shutdown, it can request that the port forward is deleted, or it can ask that the forward is only kept for X hours.  One simple way to test if UPnP is working is to look at the network neighbourhood in Windows. If you see media shares or other network devices, then chances are that UPnP is working. There are also some free tools online to test if there are any UPnP devices, or IGD devices.  Was that helpful?"
starbound,36edh4,SCPH-0815,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:21:12 2015 UTC,So it's basically LAN? And doesn't replace port-forwarding for online play?  I've been confused for so long.
starbound,36edh4,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"UPnP doesn't replace port-forwarding, it does exactly the same thing, with the difference that the client program can configure it for you automatically instead of you having to go into your router's config, selecting the IP, ports, transmission protocols, and whatnot.  And it's not LAN, because LAN doesn't really mean much (it mostly just says that one network is local, as opposed to metropolitan or wide); UPnP is a service on top of the Internet Protocol (IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is something all networks  support. Just like email or the web are services on top of TCP/IP."
starbound,36edh4,SCPH-0815,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:35:06 2015 UTC,"So I could run a Starbound server on my laptop, and without manually port-forwarding, people can connect from wherever? c:"
starbound,36edh4,TanzNukeTerror,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"If a) your router supports port forwarding via UPnP, b) UPnP is enabled on the router, c) your public IP is not behind another NAT, d) there is a corresponding open inbound port in your local firewall and e) the Starbound server is correctly configured (port numbers, UPnP etc), then yes, a Starbound player might be able to connect to the server on your notebook (assuming they know your public IP and the port)."

Start up the server on whatever computer is most powerful or on an extra computer if you have it. Just let it go through all of it's setup and stuff. If you are on Windows, open a command prompt and type in the command ""ipconfig"" without the quotation marks. Look for the entry labeled ""IPv4"" and it should look like an IP address that is 192.168.1.*** where the stars specific to the server computer. Open up Starbound and click on Multiplayer and choose what character you want to play as, and then when it asks for a server IP you just type in that 192.168.1.*** IP number and leave the server account/password blank (unless you set them for some reason). Enter the game and it should work! When you start up the Starbound server it should ask to allow it through the firewall. If you don't let it through the firewall it may not work. I've done this with my brother and for some reason it works fine when the server is running on my desktop that is hard wired to the router but it didn't work when the server was running on my brother's laptop connected over WiFi, so maybe that is a problem you are having, too."

This is the safest course of action since merely removing the mods may break your modded players and the universe too. And to return to the modded game, it's simplest to rename/move the vanilla storage folder.  edit: if you plan on switching between the two frequently, you can instead of switching the folder names, go to /giraffe_storage/starbound.config and change the mods and player path to the alternate folder's one. it's faster than moving folders but slightly more risky by user error."

And then just rename the one that I don't intend to play..? Also if I move the single player folder to a different place when I play multiplayer and then move it back when I intend to play single player, can this break the modded player/universe?

starbound,369ew7,astraltor,1 point,Wed May 20 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"The only possible problem would be if a mod uses or changes a feature that hasn't been pushed to Stable yet, but that shouldn't cause anything worse than warnings in the log or Perfectly Generic Items. Stable and Unstable are almost indistinguishable if you don't know where to look, and to my knowledge completely identical in how they handle mods. The only difference relevant to modding is available assets.  Short answer: Mods that work in Stable will work in Unstable."

Is there a tutorial/guide on how to change the config?   the config follows JSON syntax, it can be edited with any plain text editor. here's a website that will tell you if the config is valid: http://jsonlint.com/  worse comes to worse, you can delete your starbound.config and the next time starbound launches, it'll generate a default one (will reset keybinds!)  edit: instead of editing sbboot.config every time, one can make a copy of the launcher folder and edit it once and launch that folder's starbound.exe"

I'll probably keep working on it when I have spare time."
starbound,366yid,metadept,1 point,Tue May 19 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"Is gravity in space really ""zero"" though? I don't see how that's possible. It's just gets really low with distance from massive bodies like a planet or moon. I'm thinking some kind of gravity should exist in Asteroid fields, but it should be very low and be affected by any large masses nearby."
starbound,366yid,Mackinz,1 point,Wed May 20 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"No. For example, gravity in low earth orbit is only slightly less than gravity on Earth's surface. But why do people on the ISS float around you ask? That's where the ""orbit"" part comes in. When you're orbiting a body, you're basically constantly falling towards it. Except you're also moving really really really fast sideways - for example, the ISS is moving at approximately 7 kilometers per second. So you're constantly falling down, but moving fast enough sideways that it cancels out and you stay at about the same height over the planet. Because there's no air in space to slow them down, they don't slow down and fall back to Earth (at least not for several years). This leads to the same effect as skydiving - you feel weightless, stuff floats around.  In the case of an asteroid field, the asteroids are orbiting something - in this case, a star. The asteroids themselves would not be large enough to cause any significant forces of gravity, and any planets in the same system would most likely be too far away to affect you as well. So no gravity (as far as the user is concerned) is a pretty realistic representation of an asteroid field in real life."

starbound,367s6v,UR_MR_GAY,20,Sun May 17 00:08:41 2015 UTC,"I have the same issue. Inventory clutter is horrible in Starbound, especially compared to mc and terraria. I like that there are a bajillion types of tree, but if there are non-stacking saplings that look identical, you know there's a problem.  In modded minecraft, some of the most important functions (for me as a hoarder) are inventory expanders and sorting systems. One and/or both would be really great for starbound (the various pipe systems of buildcraft, for example).  I'm half inclined to make a mod for such things, but I have little modding knowledge."
starbound,367s6v,Mirrorminx,6,Sun May 17 00:44:16 2015 UTC,Inventory sort would be great! Also I am kinda clueless why those 2 pages of inventory are that way

If you want to keep things like saplings or old armors, you should invest big time into storage. Personally I just put a bunch of chests on platforms in a room on my ship for things like duplicate recipes, blocks, clothing, etc.  In my ship locker I keep instruments, stims, crop seeds, and petals. Everything else is in chests. If you're really hurting for storage space, build some storage on a bookmarked planet (one free of asteroids!). I only use on-world storage for things like duplicate clothing, where if the world somehow gets corrupted or wiped I won't feel too bad.  As a final note, be sure to trash things that you're absolutely never going to use. I collect ""valuable"" furniture (golden duckies, candelabras, shiny things in general) as a fun sort of side game, but other than that all furniture that's already been scanned in at the 3D printer gets binned."
starbound,367s6v,owlman_games,5,Sun May 17 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"First off, speaking on furniture, you should give Furniture Recycling a shot. I used it early game for stuff I didn't really need.  Second, for storage, one thing you could do as a temporary measure is take all the Old Chests and Large Chests and the variations thereof that you should be finding on the surface of planets and set up wooden shelves and entire racks of them in the ship's one big starting area. Designate chests for useful blocks like sand, clay, glass, or racial furniture, or ores and ingots, and make use of the shiplocker for that extra space. If you need some room for crafting stations just make sure to leave enough space for one or two of them for armor/weapon/ingot/etc crafting.  I'm at the endgame right now with a fully upgraded ship and have an entire single room dedicated to 24 Large Old Chests on steel platform racks for furniture I plan to eventually use, blocks for crafting, materials for furniture, etc, and I use a safe courtesy of Pixel Goods Store for storing crafting ores/ingots/rods, and a series of chests for seeds, saplings, and other stuff in my lab/indoor farm area.  Another useful idea that you do need to upgrade your ship once for I think, is The Black Market's FTL Fuel Extractor, which doesn't work at all with mod related blocks but will extract erchius fuel from all those excess vanilla game blocks like moonstone, dirt, and such cluttering the inventory.  Finally, Universal Uncrafter will work wonders for any weapons cluttering your inventory that you don't want or need."
starbound,367s6v,Jazzby,2,Mon May 18 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the chest thing, does the shelf method work for usable stuff like cooking stations? I'm completely out of space because I loaded up my non-upgraded ship with crafting stuff. Wasn't sure if they have to be on the ""ground"" or anything and I'm not home. Either way you're really helpful, just like pretty much everyone I've talked to on here, so thanks!"
starbound,367s6v,Jazzby,1 point,Mon May 18 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Anything that can be placed on flat surface, regardless of what it is, should be able to fit on a platform as long as you have enough platforms to fit it and enough space above it. If you can place them low enough to have space, you're good. If you need just a little bit more and the shiplights are all that's in your way, get rid of a couple for designated crafting station space."
starbound,367s6v,EightApes,2,Mon May 18 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"Well, you could set up a warehouse on your home planet. Just a giant cave full of wooden crates or whatever other storage option you prefer. If you don't have a home planet, well, now's as good a time as any to pick one. If you don't want to mess up your home planet, pick another planet in the same system - maybe a moon, since there's literally nothing there but liquid Erchius anyway.   Just make sure you bookmark the planet and maybe set up a teleporter when you get the chance, so you don't need to waste fuel commuting."

If you want to avoid the flutter (that is, assuming it isn't an issue just with the gif) as appears in the transition from 3->4 or 5->6, you could wire into a D-latch instead of directly into the lights and then push the D-latch's state to the light on a one-second timer."

starbound,364i5p,ulodetero,1 point,Sat May 16 04:31:43 2015 UTC,"Random thought: Would it be possible to have an in-game clock displaying the real time?  It'd probably need some very clever modding, though, right?"
starbound,364i5p,TessituraAQ,1 point,Sat May 16 08:13:02 2015 UTC,Very clever modding yes
starbound,364i5p,sesstreets,0,Sun May 17 16:30:13 2015 UTC,That's not exactly a binary counter... I think what you want to do is have the lights in this pattern: (0 is off 1 is on)  0000 0000  1000 0000  0100 0000  1100 0000  0010 0000  1010 0000  And so on. Counting in binary is different.
starbound,364i5p,SeaJayCJ,8,Sat May 16 11:35:14 2015 UTC,"It's binary, but decoded to a decimal display for readability."
starbound,364i5p,sesstreets,3,Sat May 16 12:49:51 2015 UTC,The binary-counter is all the stuff on the left in the other images. It   outputs in binary which is then decoded so that the 7-Segment Display knows which decimal number to output.  You'll notice the rows and rows of levers on the wall actually represent the numbers in binary.
starbound,364i5p,drew4232,0,Sat May 16 12:39:26 2015 UTC,I meant the lights aren't binary. That's what my zeros and 1s represent.

starbound,368y9s,ulodetero,4,Sun May 17 09:16:13 2015 UTC,Sounds completely unnecessary.
starbound,368y9s,ShallowBasketcase,2,Sun May 17 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"I think the matter manipulator separates things like iron out of the stone for us. If you go mining you'll notice that if you mine a piece of iron you pick up iron plus cobblestone. That's why they drop separately.   Different people may prefer it different ways, so maybe offer a choice in the Options section?   This idea is awful. For something this trivial, there is no reason to clutter up the options menu. Unless they added an options tab titled ""Inconsequential Gameplay Options"""
starbound,368y9s,SupaSlide,1 point,Sun May 17 12:39:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about what the MM does, just the graphical appearance of the results. The MM would still separate stuff, there'd still be iron ore and cobblestone. Only, the cobblestone would still look like cobblestone and not a shrunk-down version of itself.  The same with every other object. If you use the MM on a chair, it shouldn't suddenly shrink to about 1/4 of its size. It should really be pulled into the MM (which it isn't right now) instead of just ""loosened"".  Come to think of it, you should be able to just move things with the MM if you want instead of always picking it up, as a secondary function, but that's another matter.  Oh, and I never said this wasn't trivial. That's why it'd be an option."
starbound,368y9s,SupaSlide,3,Sun May 17 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, you should be able to just move things with the MM if you want instead of always picking it up, as a secondary function, but that's another matter.   This 100% I wish there was a way to just drag stuff around! I can't tell you how many times I just wanted to move a chair one block over and then either broke something else by accident or couldn't find it again once it was in my inventory!   Oh, and I never said this wasn't trivial. That's why it'd be an option.   It's trivial, which is why it shouldn't be an option, is what I was saying. If they put options in for every trivial thing that some people like and some people don't like, they would have a huge menu full of stuff like ""Swaying Trees"" or ""Pet Emoticons."" It would be an awful UI."

You can probably play the game from the start to the finish without having to use a guide to figure out how to craft a Brain Extractor -- they give you that kind of information in quests now. They've also retooled the fuel system so it's easier to travel from world to world -- you never get stuck on a planet trying to harvest the 200 coal you need to travel somewhere new.  There are a lot of smaller improvements with weapons, biomes, ships and food that you'll notice too.

starbound,362nvb,Observance,7,Fri May 15 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"The game engine actually has support for 'ground force'. So you could have the same max speed on slime, but make it take longer to get up to max speed."
starbound,362nvb,Sir_Cuitry,8,Fri May 15 18:46:30 2015 UTC,Reduced friction!  *Reduced friction + reduced jump and walk force could be really frustrating cool. Basically it would make you keep sliding back down into the slime pool.
starbound,362nvb,Sir_Cuitry,7,Fri May 15 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"I think these ideas about slip / sliding status effect are spot on, BUT they should be applied to oil instead. It just makes more sense. Oil shouldn't make you go slower (that would be tar...) and then just apply the oil status to slime, because I can imagine slime being very thick, heavy, sticky, and slow.  Slime making you go fast seems like molasses doing the same thing..."
starbound,362nvb,B-b-b-banjo,10,Fri May 15 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"At 20°C light crude oil is about 10x as viscous as water. Medium crude oil 163x and heavy crude oil 2193x according to this publication. Furthermore, crude oil is a poor lubricant due to aromatics and waxes in it. It's the distillates that are good lubricants since these compounds are removed. Oil behaves as it should; it slows you down when you move in it and it slows you down when coated in it.  Now slime is an interesting opportunity since it could take all sorts of different forms. Thick and sticky (like honey)? Thin and slippery (like saliva)? Etc. I tend to think thick and slippery would be most interesting. Move slowly within it, but when you're out you slip along on the ground.  It would also be interesting to have a non-Newtonian fluid implemented."
starbound,362nvb,Ewokitude,2,Fri May 15 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"So if you're running, it behaves like a solid block, but you start slowly sinking if you're walking?  I can't imagine what swimming through it would be like."

starbound,362nvb,chernobyl169,4,Sat May 16 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"Let's go more unique than the physics of the stuff. Here's some ideas:   If you're in the slime, you can see all nearby lifeforms regardless of light/line of sight, they have a glow. Alternatively it could give you sight to ore, treasure, or for whatever you're holding in your hand (good for things like plant fiber). If you're in slime, you get greatly increased energy regeneration, maybe at the cost of hunger (super metabolism!) or heat (overcharge!) These are being added back, right?. Being covered in slime allows you to avoid an attack that would otherwise hit you. Instead, the slime gets blown off and you take no damage. Since there are many fast attacks like machine guns, maybe it would need a damage threshold to be breached, or give you immunity for 1 second after you take any damage.    Ok how about some negative effects, so you could use slime offensively:   Slime covers your screen, greatly reducing vision. NPCs would have reduced vision distance. Slime drains all your energy while standing in it. Would this affect NPCs the same as PCs? Being covered in slime makes you a target for wildlife (a la Left 4 Dead).

Allow full jump height when using jump jets, grapple hooks, and the like, but drastically slow acceleration for a few seconds (until the slime ""gives"" and releases the character; the same mechanics could probably be used for the jump height). This could be implemented as a debuff (""Stuck"" or the like). Apply another debuff (""Slimed"" or ""Sticky"") that slows walking speed and wears off after a certain period of time after the Stuck debuff is removed, but can be removed with water/fire (applying fire, of course, sets the character alight, doing damage over time). Include liquid slime that only applies the Sticky debuff, and can be collected/ejected similar to oil, water, etc. Perhaps include a special weapon that can fire streamers of the liquid slime.

starbound,364pvp,HiImPantera,2,Sat May 16 03:05:32 2015 UTC,"You're right that currently there isn't anything formally to do in the endgame. We're all hoping for those endgame updates, but for the moment, we gotta entertain ourselves.   My advice is - you gotta get in the right mindset, to do it properly. The basic things to do that remain are: building (bases, villages), exploring, and collecting.   Exploring: I like to put down a flag at the beamdown point of every planet (and to take notes of the biome/dungeons on each planet). The main incentive here is to take note of the dungeons and villages (for looting/collecting), and to scout for perfect locations for various villages and bases I want to build. For example, I like to find perfect Bone areas on Arid biomes, with those jeweled skulls, and build towers above them.  Building: We don't have the endgame/colony update yet, but we do have the NPC spawner station that you can build at the ship's research station. Meaning, you can totally build and populate a village if you wanted to. And of course you can already build whatever base you fancy. Here's where committing to not using /admin to get items becomes useful -- you'll need to find the appropriate villages to loot the right furniture.  Collecting: whatever you like. You can decide to collect all the bugs, or all items of glitch furniture, or a bitchin' collection of grenade launchers. Or collect (in capture pods) a whole bunch of small lizards from the planets, etc.  You get the idea."

Any quest lines you think would be cool? Is there any where you'd want to explore in the Starbound universe that might make a cool mission or dungeon?

starbound,364pvp,justbeast,1 point,Sun May 17 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly what quests you currently have on the books but I'd like to give you a suggestion to expand end game content: have players repeat modified versions of quests.    Say they need to get Miss NPC to the other side of a planet to receive a sweet dagger, the second time they do it they have to keep her out of acid rain, the third time they might have to fight off a hoard of mole-rats to open a previously unobstructed passage as well as dealing with the acid rain, etc. Once the quest is at max difficulty the reward should include an item to complete a higher tier quest. The important thing is that at the end of the massive quest chain you drop a consumable item. If this were me I'd add a black hole or death beam to blow up a planet and run a cut scene of the surface of that particular world being torn apart when the item is used in a spacial machine (that also needs a huge quest chain to complete). The player can do this again but now their actions have changed everything making the game harder from that point on.    You already do it with the ore in the game. Get the easy to find ore, then the harder to find ore, then the super hard to get ore, oh and then you need to get spacial stuff to mix with a load of harder to find ore. It works for quests too."

I saw a Figure Crafting Mod a while ago. Maybe something like hidden figurines? Maybe the NPCs on the bases could reward you with Cosmetic Items or special furniture for completing part of a figurine collection?

starbound,35y9lm,kalez238,1 point,Fri May 15 12:10:19 2015 UTC,"I will keep that in mind. Currently the whole ""turn 3 switches"" thing isn't even in the game, my puzzles are the only ones to use them. I will try to mix things up as best I can and keep things fresh for everyone."
starbound,35y9lm,akaaai,3,Fri May 15 14:05:45 2015 UTC,That's a really cool dungeon. There should be more stuff like this in the actual game
starbound,35y9lm,trainfriend,8,Thu May 14 16:26:15 2015 UTC,Thankfully Tiyuri took notice and hired him to do just that! (For the Challenge Doors)
starbound,35y9lm,mwobey,2,Thu May 14 16:28:20 2015 UTC,Wait really?
starbound,3602ay,God_of_Fun,32,Thu May 14 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"It's leaving out the window because there isn't actually anything in the window. Windows in our ships are just an empty space in the wall with a texture behind them, so the water treats it as a hole and flows out. You should be able to just place some glass in the hole to block it up."
starbound,3602ay,GraniteMouth,2,Fri May 15 00:14:58 2015 UTC,"You are correct sir, though I feel it is worth noting, that one should use right click to do so, so that the glass is placed in the background, rather than in the foreground where it would displace the water.  Seems obvious, but some people might not know.  Also while it does fix the problem, it sort of feels like an unnecessary step to have to place glass where there already appears to be glass."
starbound,3602ay,SupaSlide,2,Mon May 18 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"I imagine it's a bug. You should go put it in the bug report subreddit (in the bar on the right there is a list of starbound related subreddits, one of which is for bug reports).  It probably hasn't been discovered because not many people try to flood their ship :P  EDIT: Why on earth are people down-voting me and up-voting /u/mrbibs350?"
starbound,3602ay,mrbibs350,5,Thu May 14 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"It's not a bug. The background of the ship, the part that doesn't disappear when you delete blocks, counts as background that water can run through. Like if you had a pool on a planet and used right click to delete background, water would run out the hole. Windows on the ship are part of the background, water runs through them. Just plug them up and you're fine. Discovered all of this when making a healing water tank."
starbound,3602ay,SupaSlide,11,Fri May 15 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"A bug doesn't have to be a glitch in the programming. Sure nothing is 'breaking' and everything is doing what it's technically supposed to do, but if we are going to say that it's not a bug then the developers must've intended for water to flow out of the windows of the ships.  Do you really think the developers intended to let water flow out of your supposedly air-tight ship?"
starbound,3602ay,mrbibs350,2,Fri May 15 11:31:14 2015 UTC,"Well, they intended for the windows to be background, and they intended for background to drain water. I can't say wether they intended water to drain out of the ship or not, they probably didn't even think about putting water in the ship. Either way, it isn't game breaking and it isn't difficult to fix. It seems too... irrelevant to report as a bug."
starbound,3602ay,SupaSlide,4,Fri May 15 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"It is unintended behavior. Everything works as it is supposed to but it causes unintended behavior. All it would take adding an exception to the ship to keep water from draining. It shouldn't be that hard, and it would fix an unintended and very strange occurrence.  Just because it isn't something that's broken, just unintended, doesn't mean it should stay in the game."
starbound,3602ay,bss03,1 point,Fri May 15 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"It is unintended behavior.   I disagree.  I'm pretty sure it was intended.  If you want anything to hold water, you have to provide a background."
starbound,3602ay,SupaSlide,4,Fri May 15 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"I mean yes, it is intended behavior that background tiles are needed to keep water in, but does it make sense for water to flow out the back of what I assume is an air-tight ship?  I am not saying that the behavior in general should change, I'm just saying it makes sense to give the ship an EXCEPTION to the rule because that makes way more sense."
starbound,3602ay,SupaSlide,0,Fri May 15 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"I've upvoted everything you've said sir, you are a champion for the cause of logic. To me it is indeed a glitch because it detracts from the game, even if only slightly. I will for sure take it to the bug report."
starbound,3602ay,bss03,2,Fri May 15 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Haha well thank you /u/God_of_Fun! :) I usually don't debate this much on Reddit of all places but I just can't understand why some people would say it makes sense for water to drain out of a space ship like that :P  If anything, if the ship had a hole in it the water would just float around in zero gravity :P"
starbound,3602ay,mrbibs350,-1,Sat May 16 02:12:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, the developers want the default behavior of placing liquids in your ship is be that it drains, and for the player to have to make a decided effort to flood their ship.  This is intended behavior, not a bug."
starbound,3602ay,SupaSlide,2,Tue May 19 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"Find me that quote and I'll believe it, until then you're just a guy saying things."
starbound,3602ay,themrpiggy22,-2,Tue May 19 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but glitch implies that it detracts from the enjoyment of the game. Ship window draining isn't a big deal, you just have to plug the windows. I'm not sure I want the devs worrying about some non-essential ""bug"" that takes no effort to work around instead of working on finding and fixing actual problems."
starbound,3602ay,bss03,3,Fri May 15 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"I said he could go report it. It's not like I told him to go force the devs to work on it. But if he reports it at least the devs can look at it when one of them goes to do some bug fixing and then that dev can decide whether it is important enough to warrant fixing. Maybe there are some critical bugs that the dev knows he should fix to make sure the game actually works, and if that's the case then I'm sure the dev will work on those important bugs. But if there aren't a whole lot of critical bugs to work on at the moment, maybe the dev will decide it's something worth fixing.  What's wrong with that?"
starbound,3602ay,renadi,0,Fri May 15 18:19:56 2015 UTC,Well think of it as the water leaking through the gap between the hull and room of your ship. You can always put glass in the window 'hole'

starbound,3602ay,renadi,2,Sat May 16 09:38:23 2015 UTC,"I understand that fixes it for the user, but the fact water flows out of the sealed space of a space ship is very unlikely to be intended, and personally, I think should be fixed."

starbound,35vtsk,SupaSlide,1 point,Thu May 14 00:29:29 2015 UTC,"/u/thetony2313 is right, you can host a server on localhost and you don't need to go over the internet, you just have to go through your own personal router :D  The problems you read about last year are mostly irrelevant now. The complaints were mostly due to the game not getting stable releases, only unstable releases and users who were set to only download stable updates were mad at the lack of updates (supposedly). But now the devs are committed to doing stable updates too :) The game has improved A LOT since Fall of last year. I HIGHLY recommend it!  And if your girlfriend wants, it is very easy to be a casual player in this game (unlike Terraria). I myself play very casually. I spawned in some Perfect armor (made by the perfectly generic block items you get if you try to call /spawnitem command with a nonexistant item) and wear that under decorative armor and it gives you tons of health. Only the bosses have posed any threat and even they weren't too hard with that armor. Then I make the armor required to progress through quests and wear that as decorative armor :)"
starbound,35uf35,Zerathras,3,Wed May 13 16:27:43 2015 UTC,It probably takes up more memory then playing on your own to HOST a server at the same time you PLAY on it (via a separate .exe)

The combat is pretty crappy at this point, though. It's been improving, but Terraria is a lot more fun to actually play right now., at least IMO. Starbound excels if you're mainly wanting to explore and is better for people who like the building aspects of these games, but I still prefer Terraria at this point."

starbound,35vtnv,SupaSlide,1 point,Thu May 14 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"I dunno but since combat had an overhaul before, I think they could do with working on new features. I myself don't play starbound for the combat, but more for building and exploration."
starbound,35vtnv,Darkpursuer,3,Thu May 14 02:41:40 2015 UTC,"The last update for combat was hardly an overhaul. The only thing they changed was how guns use energy (and that change didn't apply to just weapons) and they added the ability to choose what direction to swing swords/stab spears. Not really that interesting stuff.  Hopefully this actual combat update will be decent. Since the devs are focused on adding quest lines as a story telling element, combat is a very important piece of the game for a lot of players.  But have hope! The biggest change that they are covering on the blog right now is the ability to build colonies and have NPCs move into them. It's looking really good based on the latest blog posts and I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the colony building stuff in an update soon which should help satisfy your desire to have a reason to build :D  I myself am looking forward to building housing for NPCs way more than I am looking forward to the combat update actually :P"
starbound,35vtnv,SupaSlide,2,Thu May 14 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"At this point I just think combat needs polishing and rebalancing. But like you I have been looking forward to colonization since the beta came out. The colonies mod served that thirst for a while, but it was pretty buggy and the modder can be a little defensive towards criticism. Nevertheless he did manage to demonstrate what the game is capable of, including assigning jobs to NPCs and making NPCs build their own structure."

starbound,35vtnv,Homicidal_Sheep,1 point,Sat May 16 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"Terraria added in loads of biome Objects which didn't drop an item to erect that object someplace else. In a mining game adding items that drop nothing when mined really goes against your expectations in the worst possible way.    As /u/TanzNukeTerror explained, they added the ability to walk up single blocks. This was also around the time they were putting in half/sloped blocks. I'm totally fine with running up slope/half blocks, but running up full blocks was almost never what I wanted to do. It made getting around the surface slightly easier in some areas, but you'd fly right off the edge of cliffs into water/lava/deep pits when trying to move to the rim or when monsters knock you back.

starbound,35q2yo,SupaSlide,8,Tue May 12 18:30:27 2015 UTC,I should clarify. The biome palettes don't (always) match the biome colours directly as in the example shot. Instead they're chosen from a pool based on the biome they appear in. So you can still have bright red monsters in the jungle for example. It just gives us a bit more control to make sure colours don't clash and monsters look at home in the biome they appear in.
starbound,35q2yo,Tiyuri,2,Wed May 13 08:00:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome, exactly what I was hoping for! :D  Do you have any plans on somehow linking color to how aggressive the monster is? Like passive monsters will have a color scheme that blends in with the environment to simulate camouflage while an aggressive monster may have bright bold colors that stand out more?"
starbound,35q2yo,SupaSlide,1 point,Wed May 13 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"This is already sort of done another way; Monter ""parts"" (i.e., heads, legs, bodies, etc.) can have specific moves attached to them.

starbound,35q2yo,zsixtyfour,1 point,Wed May 13 20:08:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I know that body parts are related to monster attacks but I was just saying I think it would be cool if monster color corresponded to if whether or not the monster would be aggressive or passive.

starbound,35q2yo,Don_Camillo005,6,Wed May 13 12:41:57 2015 UTC,I hope there is still a random element to color though. Even in lush green jungles you find bright reds and such in the animals. If it was like a 2% chance to go against the given biome's color palette it would make for a neat amount of variation
starbound,35q2yo,Functionally_Drunk,4,Tue May 12 20:33:39 2015 UTC,Or just in general for jungles (and maybe Forests?) if the bright colors were part of the palette
starbound,35q2yo,Wulf_Oman,7,Tue May 12 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"I like this suggestion more than randomly adding a different color. Creating a set color palette that can be picked from would be a lot better then randomly going against the color palette.  What would be really awesome is making peaceful animals blend in more (like those in the picture above) sort of as a camouflage effect, while aggressive animals have brighter, less camouflaged colors. That way we would actually be able to guess as to whether the animal will be violent or not."

starbound,35q2yo,elt,2,Tue May 12 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"Hm, not sure I'm a fan of the biome-colored animals.  That just makes them harder to see, and potentially makes the planet look less interesting.  It's cool coming accross a big purple bear in the middle of a swamp, or to see bone white bats flying around above a lava planet.  Starbound's charm isn't in its realistic portrayal of Alien ecosystems, it's in the bizarre fantastical elements of exploring a crazy fictional universe.  Sorry, I know a lot of hard work went into that, but I don't think it was a good idea.  Pretty excited for the upcoming update!  You guys are awesome."
starbound,35q2yo,ShallowBasketcase,2,Wed May 13 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"I for one love this coloring change. Though I wonder if it would be possible to have a tiny chance for a monster to use non-biome specific colors, so it would be exciting to find something exotic once in a while. And maybe a higher chance for those bigger boss-type monsters who don't need camouflage to survive and can be a bit more eccentric.  Also, I think just as not all forest planets look the same, this doesn't mean all monsters on the same type of planet will look the same."
starbound,35q2yo,Avohaj,2,Wed May 13 08:05:25 2015 UTC,"Tiy said in a comment up above (it was just posted a few hours ago, after you were here) that the colors don't always match the biome like in the screenshot we were shown. They are designing color palettes to match biomes so that colors don't clash in an ugly way. Tiy said that we are still going to find, for example, red monsters in a jungle biome. Red doesn't really blend in to the jungle biome, but it doesn't clash in an ugly way."

It's not hard to beam down to a planet and farm for vines until you have enough bandages to mummify to god damn universe and it's not hard to make your way through the dungeon cramming whatever healing items you have into your face, it's just annoying.  Artificial difficulty is so boring because there's no reason why we couldn't have some kind of checkpoint system, even if it cost resources to repair a teleporter, it would be better to grind for a little metal than a million vines."
starbound,35p5j8,Enderbro,2,Tue May 12 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"Except unless you're playing with other people, the WHOLE dungeon resets, every enemy you killed respawns, and all the puzzles reset.  Meaning you've got to go back and restock if you fail or try again with a lessened stock of gear."
starbound,35p5j8,RoDDusty,-15,Tue May 12 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"And? You just described what some of the difficult classic games would be like if they had infinite lives, which they didn't.   Why do games have to be so easy nowadays?"
starbound,35p5j8,OmwToGallifrey,7,Tue May 12 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"So you guys justify your lack of eagerness for a challenge with dumb arguments. Seriously, you can do better than this...  It is okay to say that it is just too difficult for you - world doesn't care, this is not even a drop in an ocean, not even a fart of the smallest of fleas... BUT we, members of this sub, will gladly listen and respect your honesty.  Going back to the subject - getting a setting to fix it in a way you like it would probably do for all."
starbound,35p5j8,MoreCraft,6,Tue May 12 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying, and a lot of people feel the same way about modern gaming in general, thus the preponderance of roguelikes.  However the issue in starbound is that the Erchius mining facility is unlike the rest of the game. In fact, it seems like the hardest thing in the game and it's just the first mission. There is no solid learning curve or game design balance with the rest of the game. There is no real reason to drudge through the level over and over just to get to the boss again and again - redoing the level before the boss is easy so it is not a challenge, it's just unnecessary rectal pain.  So yeah, a challenge is one thing, but there needs to be balance."
starbound,35p5j8,elustran,10,Wed May 13 03:18:27 2015 UTC,The boss?   You just gotta keep jumping around flipping the switches and shooting the canon.
starbound,35p5j8,Reacepeto1,5,Tue May 12 11:15:06 2015 UTC,"When he hits that yung 4 laser beam BS with the mew looking ass monsters, I get killed so quick.  I probably will quit for a little while... lol"
starbound,35p5j8,noln_krbe,8,Tue May 12 11:17:53 2015 UTC,There is a trick to his 3rd phase (the 4 laser beams). If you stand exactly below or above him the lazers will not hit you. They leave a gap that you can safely stand in. The easiest way is to just take it slow and flip one switch at a time between his laser move. (Also I just ignore/avoid the extra mobs he spawns and just kill them after I kill the boss.)  Also as others have mentioned a shield really helps with this boss.  Edit: There is also a gap between the lasers on his left and right side but I'm not sure if your character will be too tall and still get hit. But just FYI.

starbound,35p5j8,SupaSlide,-2,Tue May 12 14:19:11 2015 UTC,On my current character I didn't feel like going down to find some of those core ores that you need to fix your ship so I spawned them in but the first time I misspelled the name and got a bunch of those perfectly generic item things (the green cubes) and I noticed you can use them to make some super epic armor. With that armor I was just able to run around and flip all the switches on the erchius boss no problem :P
starbound,35p5j8,shirogatsu,-3,Tue May 12 12:50:42 2015 UTC,The idea is to use technologies you've found in previous quests/exploration.   With their power you could easily avoid even 4-way laser beam
starbound,35p5j8,Milguas,10,Tue May 12 11:47:52 2015 UTC,Please tell me you didn't try to hit it with your weapons
starbound,35p5j8,machinejps,6,Tue May 12 13:01:20 2015 UTC,The two things that made this really easy were using a two handed sword to block the lasers and standing directly under the boss in the third phase of the battle. Add those two things to your strategy and you'll feel silly for having so much trouble with it before.
starbound,35p5j8,verycleanpants,1 point,Tue May 12 13:34:19 2015 UTC,Wish I could upvote twice. I failed at the boss and ragequit an embarrassing amount of times before I discovered that the deflection with the 2 handed sword effectively blocks all damage. Infinitely easier.

starbound,35m4to,galipop,5,Mon May 11 22:50:34 2015 UTC,Feature List:   1) Many
starbound,35m4to,pls-answer,5,Tue May 12 08:14:01 2015 UTC,"Not that weird, it's a perfectly valid question. Starbound doesn't have that many features when you break it down (most games don't).  You have ways of moving the character, you can mine stuff, you can build stuff, you can craft stuff and you can fight stuff. Around those mechanics we have quests, bosses, managing a ship/house, a food system and exploration. The rest are in the details.   But that stuff easily gets you 100 hours in the game. So most definitely worth getting."
starbound,35m4to,Dicethrower,3,Tue May 12 08:21:48 2015 UTC,"Given your feature list, compare: Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. You can fight stuff."
starbound,35m4to,onetrueping,8,Tue May 12 09:25:54 2015 UTC,"A while back it felt really clunky, buggy, hard to play, and had little flavor to it beyond some furniture sets.  Now, it's actually fleshed out, better, got some good systems to it, better star and biome variation. And it's even better with some mods, here's the thread for that.  Personally, I'm using Your Starbound Crew, Frackin Universe, Mysterious Stars, Prismatic Stars, Pixel Goods Store, Castlevania Decor, a bunch of things really. Universal Uncrafter is godly amazing. Also that figure mod. And others.  The loadout has made my game far more interesting than it already was."
starbound,35m4to,Jazzby,13,Mon May 11 18:05:12 2015 UTC,Great game but combat continues to be it's weak point.
starbound,35m4to,Artie-Choke,6,Mon May 11 19:40:17 2015 UTC,The next update has a big focus on combat renovation. The devs keep referring to it as the combat update even.
starbound,35m4to,SupaSlide,3,Tue May 12 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"I hope so.  I was watching some old Terraria boss fights and even though the character is 1/2 the size of SB characters, there's more personality and perceived movement in the little Terraria dudes than any of SB's.  I don't quite understand what's missing from SB characters though.  Maybe that simplistic movement does not transfer well to the larger characters of SB?  They certainly look great, but that hinged arm swing just seems... off.  And as to the actual combat, good news on the update.  At the moment it all seems pointless like you're just fighting cute inflatable balloon animals.  Gawd, give me some scary death skulls or something."
starbound,35m4to,Artie-Choke,13,Tue May 12 11:56:33 2015 UTC,"Sure it is, if you enjoy dungeon crawling, slaying monsters, housing, partying in a fucking amazing retro look in fucking outta space on an unlimited amounts of planets. For the update blog you should visit playstarbound.com"
starbound,35m4to,Surlix,5,Mon May 11 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"I just picked it up for my wife and I a couple weeks ago.  At first I wasn't sure, but it is alot of fun.  I've never played a game like it really, reminds me alot of metroid and mega man, just with building mechanics.    I would say the building and exploring are great, the quests and progression are not so great.  Depends on what kind of games you like, I've always loved building games like sim city, so I'm having alot of fun making a base to work out of.    Mods are great too!"
starbound,35m4to,eberkain,1 point,Mon May 11 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"There's a really awesome megaman mod. Only used it on the last update so it may not be functional at this point but it was awesome, even added a secondary outpost with its own quest lines. There were tons of bosses and you could get all their armors. There were even a few really cool techs."

starbound,35m4to,Mackinz,1 point,Mon May 11 21:57:44 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for this. I had just finished getting a good selection of mods installed and working on my personal server when it updated and I didn't really feel like going back and doing it again immediately so I haven't been in the loop on this new update. I'll have to go in and check it out.
starbound,35m4to,goingbananas44,4,Mon May 11 22:06:10 2015 UTC,"If you're comparing this game to minecraft or terraria, it's not yet fleshed out. I say that though coming from the patch before this huge patch. There was no real end game. There was a tier tree for armor. but in the end there was not much to do except exploration.   With the latest patch, there is a story and quests to follow through with. I have yet to beat them all, but now it feels like a game. There's a start, and what seems to be a possible end. Exploration is still there, but now it has more of a purpose than just to explore for the heck of it.   Mods exist too, although I have not messed around with these.   At the end of the day, is it worth getting? Do you like sandbox games? Do you like Space? Do you like exploring and fighting monsters? Do you like the 2D environment it's set in?   If yes, then go for it. If no, then I'd wait a bit for more things to come. Although so far personally, I have been satisified with the current patch, and if they keep moving forward in this direction, then only good things are to come."

starbound,35m4to,-Fennekin-,2,Mon May 11 21:37:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry but what is there to explore? There are planets with different biomes but in the end, they are all the same. Currently the only reason to explore is to progress in your tech tree by mining different ores. There are different monsters but all boil down to the same thing, and drop either steak or leather. There are plants but most can be just skipped or gathered on low lvl planets. There are mini-dungeons but all are easy and trivial with terrible rewards and no incentive to actually explore them. There are villages that are all pretty much the same, NPCs that just walk left and right and sell shitty gear.   I mean..... sure, most of these things are bound to change (and have been for the past few years apparently) but just because ""something might get updated"" doesn't mean we should recommend the game based on it's ""potential"", especially if OP asked for the current state of the game and currently implemented features.  tl;dr: I have a very simple benchmark on which I grade Starbound: Terraria. It came out in 2011. If Starbound can't have more features or content than a 4 year old game, I just can't recommend it over it, especially since Terraria is still getting constant updates. At this rate we might even get Terraria 2 out before Starbound... There's a slim chance but I wouldn't even be surprised much if it happened."
starbound,35m4to,NotScrollsApparently,6,Mon May 11 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"Seven hells, you lost me at ""in the end, they are all the same."". I have over 1000 hours logged into starbound and I STILL find dungeons that are new, I STILL find myself in challenging situations, and I STILL have fun travelling to new planets and exploring them.  ..That being said, meteor showers on the magma planets are stupid. They have almost no warning, and a single planet brought me from 1,000,000 pixels to 600,000."
starbound,35m4to,ChaoticStupid,2,Tue May 12 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"It's just my personal opinion. If you've seen one avian dungeon on the tier 1 planet, you've seen them all. They have same decorations, same enemies, same drops, same (shitty) rewards. Same goes for villages that have no purpose at the moment besides looking nice, if you're into that. Don't even get me started on dozens of minidungeons underground which are just 20x10 rooms with plants and a bed inside, and an empty chest. As for new planets, it was cool to embark on new planets at first but after some time I just didn't bother with exploring them all, there's really nothing to find. The only biome-specific loot is the furniture blueprint. If you want a specific set of furniture you're better off looking for coordinates or asking a friend for a copy you can scan into your 3d printer rather than randomly visiting planets and hoping you find it (as I did the first time I was searching for the USMC stone sign)."

starbound,35m4to,autourbanbot,-2,Tue May 12 01:37:33 2015 UTC,"You can't compare Starbound to terraria. The only thing they have in common is that Tiy worked on both. Starbound already hasa lot more features than terraria. Way more blocks to build with, Giant worlds. The only thing that Terraria has done better is the weapons and the mobs. Weapons are currently getting more diverse however. Microdungeons are constantly  being added. Challenge dungeons are in the work. And then there's the biggest feature... Modding support. Thisgame is community driven, and it's, as i already said in another comment, a Sandbox. Terraria is more of a adventure type game than a sandbox. And you are better of comparing Starbound to Gmod."
starbound,35m4to,-Fennekin-,1 point,Tue May 12 10:35:25 2015 UTC,You realize terraria had 100s of mods too right?
starbound,35m4to,Bloodari,2,Tue May 12 16:34:45 2015 UTC,The difference is that terraria doesn't support mods. That resulted in all of them being unplayable after one update. I am pretty sure that they are still not working. Starbound mods are also easier to make.
starbound,35m4to,-Fennekin-,1 point,Tue May 12 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"You realize most starbound mods break on major updates too right?  It has nothing to do with mod support, it's wether or not what they are modifying gets changed.  And no all the major terraria mods get updated and work fine now..."
starbound,35m4to,Bloodari,1 point,Tue May 12 21:08:19 2015 UTC,The difference is that Starbound mods are much easier to develop in the end. And you don't have to develope a entire patcher/launcher for them. I am not saying that Starbounds system is perfect but it certainly works
starbound,35m4to,-Fennekin-,0,Tue May 12 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"is this the same starbound whose community stopped making mods because the stable version is like 18 months old or so and the nightly version broke mods so developing for them to break the next day or so was a waste of time?  yeah, I thought so."
starbound,35m4to,abstractism,1 point,Tue May 12 18:04:56 2015 UTC,The Stable version is currently like a month old. And developing for the nightly is useless. i agree. that's why it is a nightly.

starbound,35m4to,Okhu,2,Mon May 11 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying that. It's just that this game is a sandbox game above all else, at least at the moment, and coming in expecting endgame is unreasonable. Especially if it's in beta. Starbound is more like minecraft at the moment. All about the mods and building.  The guy I commented on probably looked for  a experience like terraria, and that's just not what this game is, especially not in the current state of developement.  Purchasing the game based on endgame content is understandable. But people should also point out that is modtly about building at the moment."

Right now they are more of an annoyance then a challenge.   I'd also like to see more spliting enemies. (split after die or attack)  Good suggestions which would be good additions to the upcoming combat update."
starbound,35n31a,themrpiggy22,1 point,Tue May 12 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"Predator-like stealth is cool too (if it fades once he attacks and has some kind of audio cue, to be fair).  Imagine a random chance of spawning a premade alien (with its own sprite and attack patterns, like the Apex mutations or the glitch sewer monsters) that actively hunts players on ""Risky"" planets and up. A flavor text would pop up once he spawns, like ""You are being hunted"" to warn the players. I would laugh hard if it happened while exploring underground, mostly out of despair."
starbound,35n31a,themrpiggy22,1 point,Tue May 12 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"Yes! That would be cool. Or maybe a haunted status effect which spawns and despawns ghost creatures around you at random. It would last for a while or until you kill the ghost. (Low health, but  hard to hit due to low appearance times.) Could be bone or new biome related."
starbound,35n31a,themrpiggy22,1 point,Tue May 12 13:34:15 2015 UTC,"Imagine the possibilities with the Heck and slime biomes, one with maggots crawling through the ""ground"" and the other with spliting and bouncing enemies.  And if the devs want to keep their distance from the slime (kind of an overused archetype really), they could go with the gelatinous cube idea from D&D, a big and slow moving monster that pulls nearby players inside and causes damage over time. It is interesting because this is both a monster and a trap, as it is semi-transluscent and players could simply fall on top of them in badly lit areas underground (or it could fall on top of them, if they fail to see it in time)."

That aside, let's move onto your post.   Drowning/Breath Protection Tec   I agree with this. I find it kinda silly that drowning is even a thing if you get the tec to stop it. It's a tec that's so useful there's almost no reason to remove it ever.    Two suits at once   I agree with this example, however I don't think they should be two suits. I think you should be capable of combining suits or making one really good suit that is capable of protecting against all of that. A pressurized suit that's lined for radioactive environments.  That said, I also believe they should be actual suits. Something you have to wear either beneath your armor or instead of your armor. I'm more for the latter, but I doubt others would be as well.   What this Suit will do is allow you to beam back to your ship from any depth of any planet, as long as the background is removed.   Not only does that seem OP as hell and ridiculous since they just added in teleporters, but that's just silly. Why would the background control your teleporting abilities? I get your point about the two suit balance but that doesn't make sense because then you could just forgo those planets entirely thus eliminating that problem from ever coming up."

Why would the background control your teleporting abilities? I get your point about the two suit balance but that doesn't make sense because then you could just forgo those planets entirely thus eliminating that problem from ever coming up.   Well that's based on the current beaming up option. You can only beam up to your ship if you got no background, and if you're not deep inside the planet.  You said the suit is OP as hell, but frankly, if you consider the fact that you will only be able to use it on small difficulty planets, and not hardcore planets (since it will require you to wear environment protection suits), is suddenly not so OP.   I think you should be capable of combining suits or making one really good suit that is capable of protecting against all of that. A pressurized suit that's lined for radioactive environments.   Now that's OP..."
starbound,35i8vy,CrashmanX,2,Sun May 10 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"Well, actually it currently doesn't matter what suit you wear, all of them supply you with air.   Right,I herped a lil there. Thank you for correcting that. Yea, that makes no sense to me why they all supply you with air. That's just ridiculously OP and removes the fear of drowning. At worst liquid becomes a travel hazard, not a health hazard.   Well that's based on the current beaming up option. You can only beam up to your ship if you got no background, and if you're not deep inside the planet. You said the suit is OP as hell, but frankly, if you consider the fact that you will only be able to use it on small difficulty planets, and not hardcore planets (since it will require you to wear environment protection suits), is suddenly not so OP.   Like I mentioned though, you could just forgo those planets entirely. Thus eliminating that downside. Unless of course they put something on Hardcore planets that was so good or needed that you couldn't pass it up.   Now that's OP...   I should have clarified, that'd be absolute end tier that you'd be capable of doing so. It'd be at the end game so then it becomes more useful utility instead of having to swap suits for each planet. IMO utility like that should be introduced at the end of games so things that normally seem like a chore or bother don't anymore and your player can just enjoy the game without getting annoyed by small things like that. Kinda like how in Terraria you get scaling levels of movement. You start off slow, but then you find hermes boots, but then you get rocket boots, then you can combine them. Now you don't have to worry about swapping them constantly based on utility, you have them both. BUT you still have to spend a decent chunk of time without being able to combine them as you fight to fight through bosses and the dungeon to get the Goblin that'll let you combine them. (Or was it the underground?)   Point is, you make combining a late game/end game thing. That way players have to deal with the changing of items and then when they can combine them it's such a huge relief and benefit and it feels great."

starbound,35iah0,PiggeryJokery,6,Sun May 10 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"I just played through the game last week. It took me 4 days of very inconsistent play to get my gear maxed out (highest ore types and on the highest tier of star systems. I'm fairly sure. Firey Stars).  The combat felt almost exactly the same, minus having shields. You can now use multiple techs at once, which is nice. Absolutely hated the slowdown on back strife.  As a gamer of fairly decent skill and of a combat mindset. I had this game crushed in a few hours with nothing left to do. Ok, I have some more missions and maybe a boss or two? Gotta find an Avian Tomb to advance. But I sure feel done.   The missions are linear fetch quests and I don't feel like there is a good reason to explore as a combat / progression oriented player. Seemed like I spent my entire time mining and that wasn't fun at all. Well, I had some fun, but still not a game I want to put a lot of time into.

I'll quote an excerpt:   Currently there’s very little reason to settle on a planet, given the utility of the ship and the amount of space it has available to it on upgrading. We plan to remedy this in a number of different ways.    Firstly, we’re going to add a planet bookmark/teleportation system. This will allow you to get directly from your ship to a base you’ve set up on a planet instantly and without travelling to that planet first. <which is now in the game!>   Next there will be utilities and crafting resources that won’t function on your ship and will require an on planet base.    Finally there will be alternative progression paths that directly require buildings of various kinds. The nomadic nature of settling in your ship is directly in support of the combat/adventure progression path."

starbound,35f4fw,SupaSlide,1 point,Sun May 10 00:54:10 2015 UTC,"While making them out of blocks just like that would be somewhat hard/laggy to implement, it shouldn't be that hard to implement ones that are made out of spare parts in some sort of interface."
starbound,35f4fw,laz2727,1 point,Sun May 10 08:06:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the idea is that the actual making is simply placing blocks and objects like normal, then the magic kicks in and converts it all into a vehicle object.  An interface could be cool too. Like a special fabrication tool; you'd draw out a plan, hit Okay, and the tool/machine would spit out your vehicle!  :)"

But as long as Steam is installed it works, you don't even need to have Steam running.  EDIT: And you can't just put the executable file by itself somewhere, it still needs all of the config and asset files and .dll files and stuff like that, but you can move the WHOLE Starbound file that you find in the SteamApps folder to a flash drive and then create a shortcut to the .exe for Starbound."

starbound,35ab3e,Varixai,1 point,Fri May 8 19:50:25 2015 UTC,is there a list of newest implemented items?
starbound,35ab3e,Nanemae,10,Tue May 12 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"You know, these traps don't actually insta-kill you or anything. I keep thinking that the only reason these won't make it into the game is that players will think they are too hard. (or the devs will think that players will think they are too hard..)    But really, if a player is truly having trouble, they could just power through a lot of the traps in many different ways. They could use a shield (or 2), or parry with a broadsword, or just spam bandages/medkits.    tl;dr - These should definitely be in game, anybody who has trouble with them can just power through them."
starbound,35ab3e,delusionalFA,3,Fri May 8 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, quite a lot of them can just be muscled through. Not to mention different tech could make some of them substantially easier. I was considering instead of making 1 giant dungeon, I could use the new challenge gates. Sometimes loading a large dungeon that goes too far off screen messes with the wiring and breaks, so the little pocket dimensions kinda remedy that. I could just list what's needed outside the gate and then players could gear up for it. I could put an item at the end of the challenge that unlocks the next challenge gate."
starbound,35ab3e,Nanemae,1 point,Fri May 8 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"We were just discussing disabling certain techs/grappling in dungeons in IRC. It is something that may be implemented at some point, if they (the devs) think they can do it in a way that doesn't become an outright annoyance.    One feature that they have confirmed is on the to-do list is hiding wiring while in dungeons. So that will help keep players from figuring things out with the wiring tool."
starbound,35ab3e,Wulf_Oman,2,Fri May 8 18:03:10 2015 UTC,The hiding of wiring is by far the best thing they can do. Currently I can enter 99% of dungeons and figure out what to do without actually completing them. Currently the only defense is to try to make your wiring as confusing as possible with redundant and useless wiring tied in lol
starbound,35ab3e,Nanemae,2,Fri May 8 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"I think a good idea would be to have a separate wiring system, only available to server mods and the creators themselves. This way, people could make their own dungeons for people to go through on their server, and the devs could create dungeons that wouldn't be visible/navigable by the wiring tool to the player. But since I'm definitely not a coder, I have no idea about the feasibility of this idea."
starbound,35ab3e,donpapillon,1 point,Sat May 9 07:08:19 2015 UTC,"I think a better idea is to have a block that makes the wiring within a certain radius of the block invisible. As long as there's a generator in the dungeon, players cannot break the block that hides wires. Easier on the dev team, too, as making a new block is easier than a completely separate wiring system. The attribute of wire-hiding could even be applied to the current generator."
starbound,35ab3e,runetrantor,3,Sat May 9 07:13:57 2015 UTC,"Oooooh, that's a delicious idea. Much better than an entire separate system."
starbound,35ab3e,platysaur,1 point,Sat May 9 07:35:53 2015 UTC,"This is super late but  If someone found the block, couldn't they just break if? If it's unbreakable, how would people make their own dungeons from scratch? The only solution I could possibly see is a tool you spawn yourself in when in /admin and from no where else.  Honestly I'd just go with the idea of: If you weren't the one who did the wiring, you can't see or edit it"
starbound,35ab3e,Wulf_Oman,2,Wed May 27 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"I can see that being pretty good, considering that means you'd be able to make dungeons your friends couldn't easily get through."

starbound,35ab3e,runetrantor,1 point,Fri May 8 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"Were these implemented in the base game, I imagine they would have a shield disabler at the end for you to dig out, or a switch to turn the entire thing off."

starbound,35ek31,pornwich,4,Sat May 9 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"Stable is the current version of Starbound with the current content, and as the name entails, it's more stable. Unstable contains more unfinished/buggy features, but also includes future content, however since Unstable is an experimental build, some of the features may be unfinished/not work properly, i'd recommend playing Stable, since server stability is largely better."
starbound,35ek31,Treldent02,2,Sat May 9 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"This person is giving you the basic answer off the top of their head.   While technically correct, there are currently not many features in the unstable version that are exclusive. In the past few months the stable version has caught up to encompass what the unstable version had acquired for nearly a year."
starbound,35ek31,twentytoo,1 point,Sat May 9 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"/u/twentytoo is right, the Stable build has been getting updated more frequently lately, it has ship pets, teleporters, new quests, the outpost. Especially the teleporters help the game feel a lot more playable. Unless you and your friend really want to be trying out the brand new content and are willing to risk stuff not working right, go with the stable build."
starbound,35ek31,SupaSlide,2,Sat May 9 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i suppose i should've mentioned that the Nightly would probably have more 'Upcoming content' as such, i'm afraid i haven't played unstable since post Upbeat Giraffe, so my view was coming from then."
starbound,35ek31,Treldent02,1 point,Sat May 9 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"Oh no you're right, unstable does have more content! We were just saying that unstable doesn't have as much new content as it did before the major stable update a few months ago."
starbound,35ek31,SupaSlide,2,Sat May 9 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"That's kinda what i was getting at, i was just saying i wasn't aware of how much more content there is in unstable currently."
starbound,35ek31,Treldent02,1 point,Sat May 9 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"The short answer is play the Stable version. That's generally the best bet for multiplayer.    Unstable is actually behind Stable right now, until it gets the next update, which may be a little while."
starbound,35f0ew,Phantom-viper,7,Sat May 9 18:37:00 2015 UTC,"TONS has changed, certainly more than i can list here, but i'll quickly go through some of the major changes:   A more fleshed out quest system, obtained from a new location called the outpost. Many combat changes/balances, although, guns still need some polish on them. Underground microdungeons, they're themed by all the races and contain mid-low tier loot. One new race, Novakids, they can't craft melee weapons, and are focused on Guns. Planet bookmarks/remote teleporters, used for teleporting between planets. The new S.A.I.L system in ships, used for accessing tech, quests, and various other things. Matter manipulator upgrades, you can now use various matierals to make you matter manipulator even more mining capability.   Those are all the ones i could think of, there is much, much more minor tweaks and little changes everywhere."

starbound,35b0p7,Aidoboy,3,Fri May 8 16:34:41 2015 UTC,Sweet. Does the latest stable contain the 'combat update'? It seems you guys have finished with combat now and have moved on to progression. Personally I would love to get my hands on the new combat.
starbound,35b0p7,giltirn,3,Fri May 8 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"No, that update is still a few weeks away. They are just working on the new Avian dungeon and the new Challenge Room at the same time as the combat updates."
starbound,35b0p7,Varixai,2,Fri May 8 17:37:17 2015 UTC,This is just a hotfix to resolve bugs. No new content since it hasn't gone through the unstable build testing phase.  Chucklefish has a bunch of people and some of them don't have the skills to work on stuff like combat improvements (artists being the main example) so they work on implementing new content using tools that are easy for them to design content without worrying about programming. So while something like combat is being re-designed and programmed the people that aren't able to help on that implement new simple content.
starbound,35b0p7,SupaSlide,2,Fri May 8 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"I understand, thanks for the info."

Another quick post today, as most of the team is working on progression/dungeon-based things that I’m not allowed to show off yet despite repeated begging. D’ohhhh.  Spirited Giraffe Update 5 should finally fix the issue where Windows Starbound servers stop responding after port scanning, and should be coming to a stable build near you any minute now.

starbound,359gz3,HDKramer,2,Sun May 10 03:08:25 2015 UTC,"Floran Hell is a full size dungeons. Microdungeons are much smaller, many times they are only 1 room like in this reddit post.    All dungeons so far have at least some part on the surface to let you know they are there. A Sewer Dungeon has an outhouse and a ladder down into the full dungeon. An Avian Airship has an anchor on the ground with a chain leading up to the ship.    90% of planets will have 1 surface dungeon. Really the only time planets don't have one is when the terrain generator can't find a suitable location for one."

starbound,356ct4,Wulf_Oman,17,Thu May 7 15:14:41 2015 UTC,If the developers foolishly never hire you for making dungeons...once you figure out how to set up shield generators (which I think you can on world-spawned dungeons [through stuff like mods]) you should definitely consider releasing a custom dungeon mod. I'd love doing these things.
starbound,356ct4,Uxion,113,Thu May 7 16:54:54 2015 UTC,The devs should hire you because you continue to make some really neat contraptions.

starbound,356ct4,Hoploo,14,Thu May 7 17:23:57 2015 UTC,These are mostly just proof of concept type things. That's why there is no decoration or loot. Once we get the ability to place shield generators I plan on making an entire planet wide dungeon for people to download.

Like a spotlight effect or a laser beam coming out of the end. Someone seeing a dungeon like this for the first time might not even notice the camera, and having a visual cue allows for much more complex areas of the dungeon with more cameras since you can track their combined movements better."

Because of their completely different composition to other lifeforms, Novakid are sometimes unable to grasp the nuances of interracial social interactions, and have thus attained a slightly dubious reputation amongst other races. In particular, an Avian diplomat reportedly described a Novakid he met as “dense”, and elaborated upon his statement by mentioning that the Novakid in question had cheerily asked him if his god, Kluex, was real."
starbound,35bztp,player432,2,Fri May 8 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"So, the way I 'keybind' my things is pretty simple 1 for my main weapon, 2 for bandages and 3 for torches/lights. 4 is for my ranged weapon and 5 is for my grappling hook.  Now you can press X by default to use the Quick items. I keep my sword and shield there for easy and quick defense  R switches to your matter manipulator and scrolling down gets you the wiring and painting tools. All the slots to the right of the screen are for building.   As for facing, it's pretty simple, the location of your cursor is where you are facing, you move slower when you are moving backwards. You don't need to click on a mob to attack you can just swing with the cursor in that direction.  Attacking and the delay that comes with it is indeed pretty wonky, honestly you need to get a feel for it. One hand weapons are pretty quick and basically instant, Two hand weapons, specifically hammer have such a considerable delay that it makes them not feel natural. I would advise against using 2h axes or hammers since they cannot parry like the swords can - It's also worth mentioning that a revamp to the combat system is in the works and might be hitting stable soon."
starbound,35bztp,Nidmorr,2,Fri May 8 22:52:22 2015 UTC,I only skimmed so not sure if you knew this but you can put items in the L and R slots. If you tap X it will immediately go to them. If you tap Z it will switch what's in each hand  My recommendation is use this to dual wield a 1-H Sword and Bandages/A Shield
starbound,35bztp,Wulf_Oman,1 point,Sat May 9 01:53:25 2015 UTC,"Using Yellow Stimpacks will make you glow, helpful underground when no lighting. You can also throw a Flare which will just light the area where it lands for a short period of time. One really good thing to do is throw a flare into a pit and then use a gun or grenade launcher or something to clear the mobs before you drop. If you can't see the bottom of said pit, make a few platforms to jump down a bit.  For attack speed you will probably want to get a feel for your weapon, attack the air and learn it's swing speed or you can test it on mobs above ground. Once you play the game for a while you will know how fast a weapon swings just by looking at it's swing speed stat. Also don't disregard a weapon because it has low dps, a lot of weapons have low swing speed but higher dmg, just jump or run away in between swings."

Also, I REALLY hope the npc spawning conditions does not have something like Minecraft's 'must be roofless outside', meaning no condos, nor underground cities. D:"
starbound,356qku,runetrantor,1 point,Fri May 8 08:49:25 2015 UTC,On April 30th there was a blog post that showed a player in debug mode and there was a red outline that marks what is included in the NPC house. I'm hoping that they will make a system so that when you designate a house as being one for an NPC to move into you can also designate multiple rooms belonging to the same house. It shouldn't be too hard as long as they allow the outline system to outline multiple rooms.
starbound,356qku,SupaSlide,1 point,Fri May 8 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"Hopefully.  I did saw that update, and the outline seemed to me to work in the same way Terarria does, only difference being it didnt count platforms as actual borders so it extended to the second floor. And I doubt that outline is going to be visible to us for us to drag manually, but rather is the debug 'to see how it is behaving' which I am sure even Terraria has hidden in it."
starbound,356qku,runetrantor,1 point,Fri May 8 18:56:13 2015 UTC,I did say that the outline was in debug mode. But in the post they said there was a wizard scanning the walls of a room so I am hoping that implies that the player was actually choosing which rooms to include (even if we cannot see that outline since it was a picture from debug mode).
starbound,356qku,SupaSlide,1 point,Fri May 8 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know. I was just meaning that it would be useful if it was visible for us too, and then we can drag it around to expand and shrink their 'house' as we want.  The whole 'scan room' thing, at least to me, seemed more like the npc that spawns is based on what type of furniture is in his room, not that they can see beyond the designated room.  I am picturing it as how in Terraria you designate rooms for the npcs, but rather than directly say who goes where, you can tell the game a room is up for 'rent' or whatever, and if it say, has a medical bed or potion stand, then the nurse takes it."
starbound,356qku,runetrantor,1 point,Fri May 8 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I see what you mean. I like the idea of designing a room to attract certain NPCs a lot more then I like the way terraria does it where all you need is to build a slum of houses and wait for the pre-designated NPCs, and even just that aspect makes it a lot more attractive to me. But I would also love it so much if we could design multi room houses for one NPC to live in and everything in that house would be included in choosing what NPC moved in.  Even if they don't allow us to pick multiple rooms I'm just gonna design big houses for all my important NPCs and just make sure it is all included as one ""room.""  Which come to think of it, being able to see an outline of the NPC house in debug mode will be really helpful to make sure I designed the house right."
starbound,356qku,SupaSlide,1 point,Fri May 8 22:42:23 2015 UTC,"I GUESS if it turns out we cant give them more than one room, we could always assign someone to each main room in a house and act like they are a family or roomates...  I imagine they can walk around like in Terraria, so they will not just sit in their rooms.  Yes, the outline, and a 'is this valid housing?' would solve half of the issues we are going to have and prevent the mess of Terraria where everyone has a doubt of why their npc house is not valid.  What I really want to have is the option to 'offer' to come live in my town to the npcs I see in the middle of nowhere. I kind of want to bring all the scattered remains of the races together into a cool new city. This could even add a new type of sidequests, where some npcs refuse unless you do something for them, and they may be specially rare npcs that sell or offer rare stuff/services."

starbound,353rat,Varixai,3,Thu May 7 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Hey guys! It’s been a while!  I’ve been hard at work on the Avian mission for our campaign for the past couple of weeks. There has been a bit of a learning and transition period in coming to grips with Tiled, the editor which you may recall we talked about a few weeks ago. It represents a significant change in how dungeons and missions are built, and while it’s got its quirks, it has made it a lot easier to build these larger missions, especially with regard to setting up wired contraptions and puzzles.  In the past couple of days, Metadept took the time to implement two very useful wire object types; a countdown timer and a projectile shooter.  The countdown timer works more or less how you would expect it to. You are able to set a duration from one to five seconds, and the moment it stops receiving input, the timer will start to count down and will deactivate on hitting zero. This will in turn disable any devices that were receiving input from it. For those worried that a one to five second timer is too limited a window, fear not, you can easily daisy chain them to form much longer durations.  Timer GIF  With the addition of countdown timers I feel it is prudent to mention the changes that are coming to the standard timer in the next update. There are two key changes for your consideration: First, the timer now actively alternates when in the “on”, rather than the “off” state, bringing it in line with all the other wire objects. Secondly, when a timer is deactivated, it will no longer retain whatever state it was in at the time, but instead will go to the “off” state, as intended. This has facilitated us making some pretty cool obstacles using the new projectile traps.  Fire Trap GIF  In any case, that’s it from me for tonight. You fine folks enjoy the rest of your evening!   posted by Armagon"

starbound,35248o,Varixai,2,Wed May 6 18:09:20 2015 UTC,The main issue is my debate for just buying a new iMac. I know macs aren't the best but i have $350 in store credit. After that the price range for a powerful machine is about the same as a PC. And as much as I'd like to build my own I just don't have the technical prowess to build one.
starbound,35248o,martialsporK,3,Wed May 6 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"Eh, if you could find something else to usefully spend the $350 credit on.. you could easily save $1,000+ by getting something else. (performance wise that is)    For example, 2 excellent choices right now, at different price levels:   $710 - i5 4690K (3.50GHz), 8GB DDR3, 1TB HDD, 120GB SSD $1,070 - i7 4790K (4.0GHz), 8GB DDR3, 1TB HDD, 240GB SSD   That $710 PC would cost you $1,700 as an 21.5 inch iMac, and the iMac would still have worse performance by quite a ways.  I've built 4 computers so far, 3 personally and 1 professionally. Building is definitely cost effective and isn't as hard as you probably think, but yea there is much more time, effort, and learning involved. So if you would understandably rather not go that route, I would buy the $710 one in a heartbeat, and spend the $350 on something else (or save it, or trade it away)."

About the issue:  The guys over at Tom's Hardware really helped with my first build, I might, if I were you, open a ticket over there giving your specs and your exact issue to help solve your problem.   SSD's definitely help with memory retrieval, but maybe, if you make a lot of videos and delete a lot of files, you might de-frag your hard drive.

starbound,353vmk,ArchColossus,1 point,Wed May 6 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken (Which is totally possible. Nobody's perfect.), I think a lot of games now, run an internal server which you 'connect' to. I know Minecraft does it. I think Terraria does. Not sure if Starbound does, but it may.  Doesn't really help with the error, but I think it might help clarify the server thing.  As for the error, what system are you running? [Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.] What Starbound are you using? [Stable, unstable, etc.] 64-bit or 32-bit? OpenGL or no? Pretty sure those details can help pin down the problem.  I haven't had this issue myself. But if you've really done two full reinstalls, I don't know what to suggest."

I would recommend finding a mineshaft or big cave, and finding your way down to the centre of the planet to get Core Fragments, which'll allow you to explore the rest of the system, where you don't need fuel to travel between planets. Once you're able to travel, you can go to the Outpost, which allows for questlines and even the ability to upgrade your ship!  The UFO Boss is now the second boss you fight in progression and the bosses aren't just summoned, they're now in specific instances and allow for more careful planning.

starbound,352ng2,Wulf_Oman,3,Wed May 6 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"eh not really anything new that's good I guess?  Ufo boss is easier and you don't have to cheese him now.  Fuel went from being a huge grind to get to being so easy I don't know why it's even used.  The bosses are now just done through the quest system, which is fine.  Combat still sucks.  Enemies are still all pretty much the same thing with a slightly different skin and their AI still sucks.  Planets are basically still the same thing with a different skin, minus a few types.    Instead of being able to go wherever progression is now gated by how far you are in the story and going back to earlier planets has no point as you can't use anything from there.  This isn't really a huge issue for me but it kind of ruins the whole exploration point of the game when there is no reason to even go to 80% of the planets once you reach higher tiers, if your focusing on gear.  Even for the people who like to explore I am not sure how endless planets fulfills that niche as they are all basically the same.  Multiplayer is still pointless in any sense other than showing off things you have built.  There are some quests in the game now but not many and the ones that are there are more your typical fetch quest than anything engaging.  The story line is still pretty much nonexistent.    All that being said there are a lot of mods that address some of the issues above you could check out.    To be honest with as much time as they have had to develop this Terraria space clone the actual progress they have made is abysmal.  They have very little new from a conceptional stand point (procedural worlds is NOT a new feature.... You could accomplish the same thing in Terraria by creating a new world.  This would be a different argument if starbound created somewhat unique and interesting worlds instead of the copy paste change a few skins that it does today).  Crafting, mining, inventory management, and combat are all the same or worse than what we had in Terraria.  Your spaceship might as well be a floating island for all the spaceship like interactions it has, well worse in that adding to it isn't easy.    There is supposed to be a new update soon that focuses on combat, but to be honest after 3 years of checking back in to find out that nothing much has changed, or they trashed what they had and went a new direction, I have pretty much given up on this game ever amounting to anything as near as fun as Terraria was.  I am sure the starbound fanboys will come and down vote me, but if the game was good as is you wouldn't see the hundreds of posts we get in this sub asking if things have changed significantly since they last installed.  I am sure some people got their money's worth out of the game, as people like to say hours played is fine for what we paid, but I for one expected greatness and got imitation crab meat."

starbound,35267b,coconut_buttercup,6,Wed May 6 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"To clarify, some of what OP is talking about is how some objects are no longer obtainable. This is a deliberate change by adding a flag on the object to prevent it from existing in item form - by default, all objects exist as items.  Other things are just removed outright (like vanity items)."
starbound,35267b,Narks,1 point,Wed May 6 14:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine they were removed (in the case of total removal) because they won't be used any longer. Such as the Dragon boss from the old stable.   Other things , probably a part of all the other changes they are making. However, they have added more than they have removed. Chances are that a modder out there has , or will have, modified this already, or soon. Failing that, do it yourself and you're golden!"

starbound,350oqt,compmstr,2,Wed May 6 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know about bookmarks... but I also do not like having 10 berjillion bookmarks sitting in my list. A notepad would be so much simpler. Just a little icon that is grayed out on the right somewhere when you select a planet. If you click it it opens a simple window to key some text into. If a note exists that gray icon can be green.  Stuffing as much crap into a bookmark title is just hackish ... and generates clutter."

I'm looking forward to the fixed version. Might I suggest salt salad or ocean risotto for the fix? Either would be fine with one using pearlpeas and the other needs rice, both of which the player should have encountered already.  Btw, your Mod is simply beautiful! I spent almost three solid hours building a little Hylotl settlement on an ocean planet and that was only because of your mod's quest for that.  You really make me actually build some stuff in the game and I'm so very thankful for that!  BUT! I repeatedly tried to interact with a guy in a subterran USCM-base while spelunking and in four out of four tries the game crashed instantly.

Have them give out rusty metal, girders, bricks and roof tiles as materials perhaps? Sadly the Novakid haven't got much of their own in terms of decoration and materials, but having some sort of ""Revolver-punk"" theme going on might be good. Think a mixture of the ""Old West"" and steampunk, so pipes, lots of metal and such interspersed with the classic wild west look seems appopriate.  I could really get into helping an upstarting Nova-bandito set up his/her moonshining operation or outlaw crashpad. (Mos Eisley Cantina?) Sadly we'd need some sort of Novakid-spawner to populate the place appropriately and I've no idea whether you'd be able to get them into the game through mods.   I hope there's something useful to you in these little meanderings."

As a head's up on the update, it might take a little longer than expected, but that's because I have a great idea I'm going to quickly implement. I'm going to have one of the random encounters be a player's flag along with a teleporter that will take you to a random ship that'll be either friendly or an enemy. Should be pretty cool!"

starbound,34u7b1,Industrialscientific,66,Mon May 4 17:57:56 2015 UTC,I want a bullet that fires assault rifles.
starbound,34u7b1,KaedeAoi,12,Mon May 4 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"like a bullet ""dagger"" with its element, instead of being something like poison or lightning, it has an an assault rifle element?"
starbound,34u7b1,Sc4r4byte,2,Tue May 5 01:43:13 2015 UTC,Pretty much
starbound,34u7b1,KaedeAoi,8,Tue May 5 03:06:31 2015 UTC,Or an assault rifle that shoots more assault rifles that shoot knives.
starbound,34u7b1,eightbitbeard,4,Tue May 5 03:56:44 2015 UTC,Now you're thinking with rifles.
starbound,34u7b1,donpapillon,3,Tue May 5 04:48:14 2015 UTC,And the knives explode.... because....um....  EXPLOSIONS!!!!
starbound,34u7b1,Lightningbro,3,Tue May 5 12:55:39 2015 UTC,"Chucklefish plz, add swordsplosion."
starbound,34u7b1,runetrantor,9,Wed May 6 21:41:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. I like wacky and weird weapons.
starbound,34u7b1,Industrialscientific,3,Mon May 4 20:06:22 2015 UTC,The ideal would be a diablo II type system where random weapons are generated.
starbound,34u7b1,gremlinpower,8,Mon May 4 21:22:19 2015 UTC,I actually disagree with this.  A Diablo 2 system makes the same item with different numbers.  Personally I feel we need more hand crafted unique items that fundamentally change how you fight when using them.
starbound,34u7b1,Industrialscientific,1 point,Tue May 5 03:29:40 2015 UTC,Yea a bit of what you said too. I only use diablo II as a point of reference more than a perfect example.
starbound,34u7b1,averitasdeo,3,Tue May 5 12:09:11 2015 UTC,What if I had a gun.. That shot OTHER GUNS!?
starbound,34u7b1,Socrathustra,1 point,Tue May 5 07:36:22 2015 UTC,A gun... that's also a sword... with smaller gun swords on it... that shoots other gun-swords.
starbound,34u7b1,Nematrec,26,Wed May 6 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm unsure if this is intended or bugged, but either way it is super cool. It has a fire rate of 100 and produces these little energy balls that you can create walls around yourself and they travel with you. They do very light damage but last a decent amount of time. I am not sure if it is intentional though as I have spawned in over 100 spears and only gotten 1 with this ability."
starbound,34u7b1,Wulf_Oman,24,Mon May 4 16:29:23 2015 UTC,Maybe if we make enough noise it can become an ascended bug :D
starbound,34u7b1,taalmahret,12,Mon May 4 17:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if it is a bug I'd kinda like to see it, or at least some version of it make it in."
starbound,34u7b1,Wulf_Oman,3,Mon May 4 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"I actually have a thing like this, ""Shield Generators"", in my Crystalworks mod. However, if you can provide a player file of any player holding it as I weapon; I could probably implement something like it in one of my mods"

starbound,34u7b1,lazarus78,3,Mon May 4 17:18:36 2015 UTC,"A few months ago i found a gun that shot bullets slowly like this, then they would speed off after like a second."
starbound,34u7b1,Old_Crow89,6,Mon May 4 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"Those are on purpose, but sorta a debuff in terraria terms. They're wicked fast once they pick up pace, but due to their slow movement, it's easy to miss."
starbound,34u7b1,nerfviking,1 point,Mon May 4 21:39:38 2015 UTC,Your case might just be a case of that effect being applied to guns improperly. It seems like a great effect for spears though. Who knows.
starbound,34u7b1,Sir_Cuitry,4,Mon May 4 22:10:37 2015 UTC,nah there is even an ammunition graphic on weapons with with and unique bullet sprite. Found on multipule guns in the stable build. Fully intentional.
starbound,34u7b1,MomiziWolfie,1 point,Mon May 4 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"Depending on how they go about generating the random values for weapons, it might be ""emergent"", rather than intended or bugged.  That is, it could be that no one thought that random numbers would make a weapon do that, but everything is still working as intended."
starbound,34u7b1,MysticKirby,2,Mon May 4 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"AFAIK projectile speed is not random, just rate of fire, damage, and energy usage. Projectile properties are picked from a pre-set list. (This is, of course, if they haven't retooled things in the Nightly. )"

starbound,34z83o,ReclusiveAlgorithm,1 point,Wed May 6 06:29:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's when you have a key down and focus leaves the window.  Usually, by pressing the same key and releasing (after getting focus back), the window will get the update that the key is no longer pressed."

starbound,34te0c,Chum42,2,Mon May 4 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"Since the time between any two state changes in these puzzles is equal, you could make it fairly easily by making a shift register connected to itself (ie. a ring counter), then just connect each state in the register to the appropriate doors. For polish, stick a little delay on each door.  But I'm sure you already had something like that in mind."
starbound,34te0c,justbeast,3,Mon May 4 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"I have all the start/stop systems designed already. I learned the hard way you can't load/unload parts of the world with active wiring. Causes crazy speed jumps and lag. So I designed simple toggles that start the clocks when the player enters a dungeon area, turning it on. When he leaves it turns off. I am probably going to put a teleporter after each successful dungeon for players to save their spot in the event that they die, they can go back without starting over."
starbound,34te0c,-Xren-,1 point,Mon May 4 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"The Rockman series has some really polished and challeging level designs, you should really research it.

starbound,34te0c,Rouwser,3,Tue May 5 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"Rockman huh? I'll do my research, thanks for the tip.  I wouldn't ask CF to buy my ideas, but I would love to work along side them or even for them. Their website says they are not hiring though, so I am not getting my hopes up haha. However, I do agree that they need some kind of sharing feature. Starbound has a ton of potential in use created content."

starbound,34y5be,gypsysmoke,2,Tue May 5 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"1a. You get access to new content a little faster, at the cost of the game being, well, unstable. For you, I think staying on Stable is fine, you still have 90% of the game to see.    1b. The short answer is no, OpenGL probably won't give you a boost in anything. For some systems it works a bit better, others a bit worse, mostly it's around the same.      2a. You can finish some of the missions easier in multiplayer. You haven't done the first mission yet so you may revisit this option after you do. You can also collaborate on building stuff. The drawback is that your stuff is not as safe, so backup your ship. (Copy your shipworld file somewhere)    2b. Yes, there are many community servers, you can find them on the related forum section and the big fansite server list.      3 & 4. Both of these are answered at the official wiki. The short answer is yes there is plenty more, you have only done about 5% of the quests and none of the missions. And yes, each tier of planet gives higher level resources."
