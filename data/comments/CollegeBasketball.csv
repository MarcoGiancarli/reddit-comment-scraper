CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,fakeshits,35,Tue Jul 21 08:26:54 2015 UTC,Elton Brand lived up to expectations his first 10 years or so before injury.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,ramblin_gamblin,14,Tue Jul 21 15:07:36 2015 UTC,Most drafted NBA players fail to live up to expectations. It's in incredibly hard to become even a solid NBA starter. Most players in each draft won't meet that standard. It's just asking too much to expect it.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,NewYorkerinGeorgia,7,Tue Jul 21 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"That's true. Then, there are a handful that wildly exceed expectations.   It sounds like Phil is just a classic knee-jerk Duke hater.   Heck, I can think of some former Duke players who exceeded expectations in the NBA. JJ Redick comes to mind. The expectations weren't exactly high, but he's 8 seasons into the NBA and still improving. He averaged over 18 points per game last year with the Clippers.   In 2005-2006, how many people thought that Redick would be in the NBA after 8 seasons? I didn't."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,baldylox,39,Tue Jul 21 19:39:36 2015 UTC,Anybody who thinks JJ is a bust at this point is crazy.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,amarner32,6,Tue Jul 21 16:10:46 2015 UTC,There was a point there early on in JJ's career where it looked like he might be a bust but damn did he turn it around.  He's actually far exceeded what I thought he'd do on the pro level.  Dude ended up translating his game almost perfectly.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,3,Tue Jul 21 20:30:58 2015 UTC,He was a better college player though.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Claclink,4,Tue Jul 21 18:58:34 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter.  Almost everyone that plays in the NBA was better in college...
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,3,Tue Jul 21 20:31:32 2015 UTC,yea but he was putting up 26.8 ppg his last year at duke.  he was a superstar in college.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Claclink,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"That's true for like 80% of players getting drafted though. They get drafted for a reason, and the NBA is a different world of talent compared to college, of course they won't dominate the same way."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Deified,-4,Tue Jul 21 20:34:21 2015 UTC,If you expected him to be a super star then he was a bust in that regard.  But to be a super star you need the right amount of talent and charisma to achieve it.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,mellolizard,62,Tue Jul 21 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"Meh, I'd say Battier, Dunleavy, Boozer, Deng, Irving, Parker(so far), Henderson, Redick, McRoberts have all done as expected, if not better.    Think this is just him thinking it's still 2010."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,chrisncsu,66,Tue Jul 21 12:27:08 2015 UTC,"Meh, I'd say Battier, Dunleavy (....) have all done as expected, if not better.    Shane Battier was the 6th overall pick and has career averages of 8 pts and 4 rbs.    Mike Dunleavy was the 3rd overall pick and has career averages of 11 pts and 4 rbs.  Not saying they've had bad careers but they don't belong on the ""exceeded or met expectations list.""  That being said, it's a pretty dumb comment from Phil.    Edit: I'm willing to ""concede"" that due to Battier's intangibles, a decent argument could be made that he's met expectations."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,8,Tue Jul 21 12:40:26 2015 UTC,I think we need to define what expectations are.  People don't realize that an absurd number of players (including high draft picks) amount to pretty much nothing in the league.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,flashcats,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"Taking a guy in the lottery tends to be a guy you build your franchise around. Role players are great, but you don't expect that from a high draft pick in sincerity. I've seen my fair share as a KU alum. Lots of guys that were great in college but didn't pan out like one expected. Fact of life."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,BoredTyrannosaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, this really isn't a point for discussion.  There are 14 lottery picks each year. Do you really think there are 14 lottery picks in each draft? Of course not.  Each draft will have 1-3 franchise players a year.  Everyone HOPES a lottery pick will be a franchise player, but the reality is they won't be in all likelihood."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,flashcats,18,Tue Jul 21 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"Well you're lumping in the last few seasons there with Battier when he's been a key reserve.  His first 6 seasons he averaged 10.5 ppg and 2 of those seasons he wasn't even a full-time starter.  He also was a hustle guy on defense.  NBA All-Rookie First Team, 2x NBA All-Defensive team, 2x NBA champion...not really a bad line for a top 10 pick.    I didn't realize Dunleavy was a top 3 pick, but he's been pretty consistent for a long time in the NBA.  I mean he averaged almost 20ppg for Indiana in 07-08.  Then looking at the #1 and #2 picks in his draft, Yao had 4 full healthy seasons in the NBA(though putting up really good numbers) and of course Jay Williams only played the 1 season because of the motorcycle accident.    Still think Phil is still living in 2009-2010 when that was what everyone said about Duke.  ""Yeah they're good in college but all the players suck in the NBA"", which I just don't think is the case right now or going forward.  Only going to improve now with all the one-and-done players they're starting to land."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,chrisncsu,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:00:36 2015 UTC,"There's nothing subjective about what I wrote, it's just not all inclusive since it's based off such simple stats.  The 3rd overall pick historically averages 15 & 5 and the 6th overall pick historically averages 10 & 4, for their respective careers.  They're both below average, Dunleavy more so than Battier.  It should be noted that using historical averages based off draft pick # can really only be applied with any semblance of accuracy to current players that are near the end of their career which of course relates ok with Battier & Dunleavy.  Their career averages are very likely to decrease even further, solidifying my stance even more."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,15,Tue Jul 21 13:09:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, how many #6 overall picks play 14 seasons and end up in a reserve role their last few years playing plenty of minutes but playing for defense and spot shooting to pull down their averages?     I mean looking at other #6 overall picks: Brandon Roy - 5 seasons.  18.8/4.3 Martell Webster - 10 seasons, 8.7/4 Josh Childress - 8 seasons, 9.1/4.7 Chris Kaman - 12 seasons, 11.4/7.7 Dajuan Wagner - 4 seasons, 9.4/1.4 Shane Battier - 14 seasons, 8.6/4.2 DerMarr Johnson - 7 seasons, 6.2/2.2 Wally Szczerbiak - 12 seasons, 14.1/4.0 Robert Traylor - 7 seasons, 4.8/3.7 Ron Mercer - 10 seasons, 13.6/3.1    Battier had a longer career, thus pulling his averages down towards the end, and he still ended up being very comparable to the other 9 here.  Not to mention being 2x All-NBA Defensive team, something those stats really don't account for.    It's also hard to compare historic numbers for players based exclusively on averages because they're averages and the length of the career will always have a detrimental effect on the numbers.    I mean compare Josh Childress and Shane Battier.  They have very comparable numbers, but just based off averages you'd say Childress averaged more ppg and more rpg, so he was a better #6 pick.  In actuality, Battier played 6 more seasons and in Battier's first 8 seasons he averaged 10/4, which would be better than Childress(and on par with your #6 overall average).    So based on the other 9 players here, the average per player is 8 seasons.  If you take Battier's stats his first 8 seasons, he'd be at 10/4, which is your historic median.  So I'd say he did exactly as expected statistically, and I'd give him a bump to above-average based on the defensive awards and 2 titles."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,chrisncsu,4,Tue Jul 21 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"Brandon Roy - 5 seasons. 18.8/4.3   Poor Roy, assload of potential, but just didn't have the knees to back up his play"
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,realbabysealclubber,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:24:24 2015 UTC,The interesting counterpoint to that is the fact that Battier has averaged over 5 minutes more per game over his career than the cumulative stats he's being compared against in my post.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,12,Tue Jul 21 14:01:39 2015 UTC,"True but he's been a defensive specialist, he hasn't been asked to be a volume scorer.  I mean Kevin Love dropped almost 10/2 per game going from option #1 in Memphies to option #3 in Cleveland.  Battier is on the Heat with James/Wade/Bosh, how many shots do you really want him taking per game as the coach?    You're an NBA franchise, picking 6th overall.  You'd really say no to a guy that plays 14 seasons, puts up fairly comparable offensive stats to historic #6 picks, is an All-NBA level defensive player a good portion of his career, makes the All-NBA rookie team, wins 2 titles, and wins the NBA's Best Teammate Award?    I just don't see how you take his career as a whole and say he didn't live up to expectations."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,chrisncsu,3,Tue Jul 21 14:17:19 2015 UTC,"You'd really say no to a guy that plays 14 seasons, puts up fairly comparable offensive stats to historic #6 picks, is an All-NBA level defensive player a good portion of his career, makes the All-NBA rookie team, wins 2 titles, and wins the NBA's Best Teammate Award?   I mean really the only way to answer this is to re-draft every single draft (based off some metric we agree upon) and then average where Battier ranks in each respective draft.  If I just were to guess, I'd say there are 6+ players in each draft looking back that most NBA GMs would take over Battier.  That being said, you've made some good points about Battier & maybe he has in fact met expectations.  I'm listening to what you're saying and respect your opinion."

CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pertsix,16,Tue Jul 21 15:32:52 2015 UTC,You can't judge Battier by his numbers. Any team in the league would have loved to have him on their team at any point in his career.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,JtkBasketball,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:16:01 2015 UTC,"Any team in the league would have loved to have him on their team at any point in his career.    Ok.  Still doesn't mean he's met or exceeded his expectations.  Like I said, he hasn't had a bad career and I'm certainly not implying that he's a bad player."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,7,Tue Jul 21 13:23:11 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but I think starting on a back-to-back title team and being All-NBA defense is great for a sixth pick. Agree to disagree."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,JtkBasketball,4,Tue Jul 21 13:33:12 2015 UTC,Battier didn't start in the 2013 Championship. He averaged the 9th most minutes in the finals for the Heat.

CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,JtkBasketball,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really disagreeing with you about anything.  Just saying that the fact that ""Any team in the league would have loved to have him on their team at any point in his career"" isn't really relevant to the discussion of his relative worth compared to 6th picks historically.  Battier is an above average NBA player that's had a very nice career full of many accomplishments."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,7,Tue Jul 21 14:14:34 2015 UTC,using pure ppg for battier is just silly.  it's a relatively worthless analysis.  Battier certainly met expectations for his career.  His value wasn't from how many ppg he scored.  Dunleavy was way below expectations for a #3 pick.  Was drafted far too early.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,MrDannyOcean,3,Tue Jul 21 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"Dunleavy was way below expectations for a #3 pick.  Was drafted far too early.   In 2007-2008 Dunleavy averaged:  19.1 PPG  5.2 RPG  3.5  APG  47.6 FG%  42.4 3PT%  60.5 TS%  The following year, Dunleavy was dealing with a serious injury which threatened to retire him completely.  He was on and off the court with back issues, bone spurs which required surgery, damage to his patella tendon etc.  The fact that Dunleavy came out the other side of that as a valuable role player is impressive in itseld.  Without the injuries, which no player can control, he was a 15+ PPG scorer and an above average player.  That production and a 10+ year career for someone in an awful draft isn't too shabby, even if he was picked relatively high.  Mike even has playoff averages of 10+ PPG and over 64% TS.  He has been a valuable two way player in the league for a long time.  That's nothing to sneeze at.   using pure ppg for battier is just silly.   It's just as silly for Dunleavy.  The guy was a great scoring wing before the injuries, and even after them he's carved out his spot in the NBA.  However, his total value, like Battier's, can jever be distilled into his career PPG numbers.  Mike's an above average decision maker, a great complimentary offensive option who can still hold his own on D.    Is 3rd overall a high pick for Dunleavy?  Not in the abysmal 2002 draft IMO.  Even if you re-drafted today, knowing everything we know, Dunleavy Jr still probably goes top five!  Boozer slipped to the second round, Tayshaun Prince wasn't in the lottery and a high school Amare Stoudemire was on the fringe of the top ten.  Other than that the '02 draft is full of names that even most basketball fans wouldn't recognise.  Not every lottery pick is a game changing franchise stud.  Sometimes there's a slew of those in a single draft and sometimes there's none.  But grabbing a 14 year NBA veteran with a high pick doesn't mean that player's a waste or a bust or someone who was overrated.  This thread is full of people who don't understand how insanely difficult it is to make it in a professional league.  The NBA specifically only has 30 teams, and 12-15 roster spots on each team.  That's 450 job opportunities, at most, every season with 60 new additions every draft and even more un-signed and un-draft talents looking to try out.  Sticking in the league for a decade and a half isn't really falling short of expectations, wherever you were drafted."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,poorchris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"Based off pure basketball abilities and entirely excluding injuries, I think these players would be drafted ahead of Dunleavy in 2002 in retrospect: Yao, Jay Williams, Amare, Caron Butler, Tayshaun Prince, Boozer.  But you're right, 2002 was an abysmal draft class.  Also, you're really hung up on that 8th season for Dunleavy where he put up numbers on a terrible Pacers team.  If you're singling stuff out like that, then you can even make an argument that a guy like Luis Scola, who had a nice run from 2009-2012, would be drafted ahead of him.  And yes, I know Dunleavy was injured after 2008 so I'm cutting him some slack since then.  He had plenty of time to show what he had when he was healthy, though."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,3,Tue Jul 21 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"Mike Dunleavy was the 3rd overall pick and has career averages of 11 pts and 4 rbs.   Mike Dunleavy Jr doesn't belong anywhere near a list of underachievers.  Everyone forgets that he was a 19 PPG hybrid wing with a variety of NBA level skills until he ran into a slew of injuries that threatened to retire him from basketball completely.  The fact that he's reinvented himself as an above average role player on both sides of the floor after that is all the more impressive.  Also, Battier was a high pick but he was the 6th pick in a terrible draft.  When Kwame Brown, Eddy Curry, DeSagana Diop, Troy Murphy and a high school Tyson Chandler all go in the lottery, Shane isn't doing too bad.  Especially since he became a premier lockdown defender in the league."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,poorchris,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that 2001 and 2002 were pretty weak drafts, too. If you were reselecting with everything we know now, Battier would still fall pretty close to #6. I certainly would pick him ahead of Kwame Brown and Eddy Curry.  On an unrelated note, I think if I were JR Smith, I would get a little pissed at Phil letting ESPN know I was having girl problems."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,TaborlinTheGreat,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:21:41 2015 UTC,No doubt.  But there are other years in the draft where he might fall out of the top 10 quite easily.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I'm just saying if we're measuring his expectations based on his slot in the draft, we should do so within the context of the strength of that draft. He was considered to be the 6th best player coming into the league in 2001, and he ended up pretty close to that."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,TaborlinTheGreat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"career averages   Keep in mind that by citing an NBA player's career averages, you're including his first year or two as well as the last 5 when he was older and possibly slower.  I don't think a case can be made for ""averages"" meaning much in evaluating how good a past player was to his team(s)."

CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Galt2112,5,Tue Jul 21 18:38:44 2015 UTC,"No he isn't.  He's a rotation player who can fill your ~8th man spot as a 3rd or 4th big without totally embarrassing himself.  Not great on offense, but does reasonably well on D.  Has a minimum level of competence as far as rebounding and dunking.    He's not a star or even a starter.   But he can contribute a little bit as a bench player, which is SOLIDLY above what was expected him coming out of college (he was expected to be playing in Turkey or Latvia or something)."

Also weird that people are citing points and rebounds instead of using things like PER, VORP, TS%, etc. This isn't 2005 guys. Let's use advanced stats.  Also weird are Duke fans saying K hasn't had an issue with success at the next level. It's leveled out a lot in recent years due to the guys we've put out the past 10 years or so but it was bad for a while.  And this whole thing is weird because people are taking Phil seriously.

CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,homemade_mayo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being a jerk but anyways, yes I agree a far more advanced study could be conducted (obviously).  I didn't claim to provide anything other than pts/rbs by draft pick and even gave credit to Battier's intangibles.  My original post in this thread was just a beyond simple look at career numbers because, of the players listed in the post I replied to, Dunleavy and Battier immediately stuck out as guys that I felt had underachieved based off their respective draft pick location.  I did a quick Google search, while at work, found some site that compiled pts/rbs/asts for each draft pick for a 20 year period and replied in 2 minutes.    If you have a quick method of attaining a value based metric for what the ~6th player chosen in an NBA draft should be, please feel free to share.  I don't have time right now to compile data from B-R."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,pasimp44,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:16:05 2015 UTC,"Because your post is lazy and offers nothing of merit. Arguing about pts/rebs/asts across years is literally as lazy as it gets. It ignores tempo and pace changes, defensive metrics and minutes played.  It's like wins and ERA in baseball. Not only did your argument not add anything of value, it actually detracts from an intelligent discussion. It actually would have been more valuable to not comment at all.  For example, from 2005-2008, Battier finished 21st, 19th and 14th in VORP. That puts him around Kawhi, John Wall, Kyrie, Millsap, Tyson Chandler, Griffin, Hayward and Cousins this year if you are looking for a contemporary comparison.  That adds something. It's a value stat that takes multiple different aspects of a game into account. The top of VORP for this year is Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Paul, Lebron.   If we are using PPG, then a guy like Kawhi (very valuable, yes) finishes below Tony Wroten.   APG, and Kawhi is 119th and behind SFs Trevor Ariza and Rudy Gay.  RPG and Kawhi is 43rd behind Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Brook Lopez.  PPG, RPG, APG - they're easily consumable metrics but completely useless."

CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Deathscythe07,3,Tue Jul 21 14:39:59 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there isn't a trade-off somewhere in player development. There are a lot of successful college programs that just don't send a lot of players to the NBA. Rather, there are some successful college programs who don't seem to prepare players for success in the league.  I'm curious if the fanbase for any of those teams would trade some college wins for better NBA careers for their grads? I'm asking because I'm a fan of a coach who is one of the absolute best at developing talent for the NBA, but is on the hot seat because his teams have been losing for the past few years.  Here's a good article w/ numbers on the coaches who produce NBA players.  This might be the key stat: NBA Minutes per game by coach If you judge by this, Jackson should be throwing shade at Izzo or Pitino, not Krzyzewski.  If you want to check your program against these numbers, this is the easiest way to look up current NBA players by college that I've found. Just choose your school and sort by the ""To"" column to get the active players."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Koppenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:50 2015 UTC,"In the ""Minutes Per Coach"" chart, what is the time frame? Ie is that for one season, what season, etc? Not bashing it, I'm just curious."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:35 2015 UTC,"It's minutes per game. So at the top end of the spectrum, Thad Matta's players average well over 20 minutes per game. At the bottom end, Pitino's NBA players average 10 minutes per game. So the chart tells us which coach's players are producing and which are in back up roles.  The numbers themselves are for players who entered the league since 2006 (When the one and done rule went into effect) and the 15 coaches are the coaches w/ the most NBA players (drafted and non-drafted) between 2006 and 2014."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Koppenberg,0,Tue Jul 21 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"2006-2014? Wow that is extensive!   So Syracuse players averaged 16 or 17 minutes per EVERY single NBA game over that span? I thought that was impressive until I figured out that there are 480 minutes per game, and so that's only 3-4% of each game."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"Um, no.  Minutes-per-game is an official stat that records how many minutes per game a player averages. It's the total number of minutes played divided by number of games they appeared in.  For the chart, it seems apparent that the MPG numbers for each of a coach's NBA players have been averaged.  So, for Boeheim's players who are active in the NBA now, it would look like this.    Player name MPG    Carmello Anthony 35.5   Michael Carter-Williams 33.6   Tyler Ennis 12.5   Jerami Grant 21.2   Wesley Johnson 25.7   Arinze Onuaku 8.9   Dion Waiters 28.6   Boeheim Players' average 23.86"

I'd love to see Jackson try to coach a Duke team for a year and see if he can do half of what Coach K does with his teams.   Who's phone rings first when a coach is needed for the US Olympic team? Even though it's a team of superstars?   Duke isn't exactly thought of as a training mill for 1-and-done future NBA stars, either."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,drcash360-2ndaccount,-3,Tue Jul 21 08:33:57 2015 UTC,"Kyrie.  He's right though, duke guys often leave more to be desired"
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,camelheeler,-11,Tue Jul 21 11:48:16 2015 UTC,"Phil is spot on!   Take a minute and think about all the McDonald's All Americans Coach K has had (more than anyone). Now think about all the NCAA All Americans he has had (more than anyone).   Out of all of those players, how many of those players won an NBA Championship?   Answer: Just 2!!!! Danny Ferry who rode the bench and didn't score a point; Shane Battier (2 titles with the Heat) where actually contributed some to Lebron, Wade and Bosh's first Championship. But, let's face it, he wasn't exactly a determining factor and only played spot minutes in the second title run.   Phil Jackson wants to win Championships. With the track record of Coach K's players, I wouldn't draft them either. I know some have had freak injuries but which of all of Coach K's talented players have even been a top 3 option for their team? I know K's players have done amazing things in college but Phil Jackson wants guys that will do amazing things in the NBA. For whatever reason, Coach K's players have underachieved spectacularly. I'm not saying they've all sucked but when you think of the crazy amount of talent he's recruited and then you compare that to the number of players that are more than just average journeyman, it's mindboggling."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,baldylox,4,Tue Jul 21 12:27:59 2015 UTC,"Duke fans: Would you like Phil Jackson to coach the Blue Devils for a season?   Yeah, I didn't think so.   Coach K doesn't recruit all the top 1-and-done players in the country. He recruits kids that are fundamentally solid players that are academically prepared for Duke, and turns them into one hell of a basketball team.   I was at the Final Four back in April. I saw it with my own two eye holes. Duke's performance Saturday against MSU was one of the greatest defensive performances I've ever seen.   They did pretty well Monday night, too.   Give Jackson Coach K's job for one season and see if he can do half of what Coach K does with his teams.   There's a reason that Coach K's phone rings first when the Olympic team needs a coach.   I think Jackson's a little jealous."

CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,camelheeler,0,Tue Jul 21 19:48:04 2015 UTC,I would seriously be interested in a full response to this. Maybe I'm wrong somehow. I just don't see how you take the collection of talent Coach K has had and produce so few top shelf NBA players.
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,flashcats,6,Tue Jul 21 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to say? I guess your thesis is that Coach K is either ruining players or he is recruiting players that will succeed in college but can't succeed in the NBA, right?  The reason Duke doesn't have a ton of superstar players is because a massive proportion of players flame out in the NBA including high draft picks regardless of what college they went to.  Go look at the rankings of players by PER from last year. It's not like there is one school/coach that is dominant. The top players come from all different schools and coaches."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,BosqueBravo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yup.  And to abridge what I was writing before, it is an observation bias.  Most of those players that flame out come from teams all over, and as soon as they do the observer forgets about them.  So the percentage of successful players overall feels way higher than it actually is.  But, when you are focusing on one program (like Duke), you don't forget the flame outs in the same way.  So you see a more accurate representation of the statistics, or you might have confirmation biases working in and focus on the failures while ignoring the successes."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Gcashwell,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget Battier's 6 threes in game 7 of the 2013 finals, nor his defense on Duncan in the last minute that didn't let the Spurs tie it."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,camelheeler,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:58:10 2015 UTC,I'm not saying Battier wasn't good/valuable by any means but there are a million plays in the course of a Championship series and Battier wasn't involved/important in 99% of them. That's not to say he wasn't important to the team either. He was just probably the 7th or 8th most valuable player on that team.

Don't you find it just a little bit odd that we can't point to a single player (other than Grant Hill) out of all the player's Coach K has had that you would even dare use the word ""great"" with? He's had tons of decent/good NBA players, but think about the talent he starts out with. He has had more talent in the last 25 years than anyone. What the hell happens to them when they get there? How many guys were McDonald's All Americans and were damn near sure thing NBA players that ended up undrafted? A ton!"
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Onyxpanda,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:13 2015 UTC,"How many guys were McDonald's All Americans and were damn near sure thing NBA players that ended up undrafted? A ton!   McD AAs are one thing but what are some examples of your super subjective second part? Do you think I'll be able to find similar examples for any school?  Also Coach K has had lots of AAs, but where you're obviously wrong is suggesting he hasn't developed them. He has two key tasks in his job: develop his players to the next step in their careers (i.e. NBA) and win games/championships. Ignoring the obvious second part, here's some facts (read: has data to support it) assuming players pick a college with the goal of 1) going to the NBA and 2) being a lottery pick > 1st round > 2nd round in preference:  Note: these are all numbers I found in 5 min of Google searches so 1) you can do it too and 2) may not be the most up to date.   In the past 25 years (since 2012 so it probably wouldn't be significantly different with the exception of UK moving up), Duke has the most lottery picks in the draft (16, second is 14). This means that NBA GMs and scouts believe, at the point where they leave Duke, this cohort has the great potential to succeed in the NBA. Are you saying Duke builds some flaw into their players that's undetectable by NBA GMs and scouts? Same source: 2nd in total number drafted and 1st in weighted (by preference above) draft position.  In the past year, tied with UK for number of players in the NBA. From 1985 - 2012, 2nd in aggregate player NBA earnings ($809 million. Would you say earnings is a good indication of success/longevity?"
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,baldylox,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"He has two key tasks in his job: develop his players to the next step in their careers (i.e. NBA) and win games/championships.   Three key tasks - Coach K also stresses academics, makes sure his players are going to class, and has an extremely high graduation rate.   Coach K certainly isn't the only coach that does that, but that aspect of college basketball is every bit as important to Coach K as winning, I promise.     From 1985 - 2012, 2nd in aggregate player NBA earnings ($809 million. Would you say earnings is a good indication of success/longevity?   Wow. That is an impressive stat. You can't argue that earnings are a very clear indicator of success. Players that don't live up to expectations don't get the big bucks."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,Onyxpanda,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, my bad. I meant to categorize development as both basketball and academics, and should have put (e.g. NBA) instead.   Also the aggregate earnings is impressive, but I don't mean to imply that it's that much better than other schools in the top 5 - any of the schools in that group are impressive and have huge alumni earnings. But certainly it goes against what camelheeler is implying."
CollegeBasketball,3e1t7j,baldylox,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, no - not your bad. I just added a third job. :-)  The earnings stat alone is enough to disprove the theory that Duke players aren't ready for the NBA."

Now, I know what you're thinking.  How'd a used car salesman from Memphis end up coaching a loaded team from California?  Fair question.  As the story goes, Dana and David Pump, the men who ran the California-based team, got to know Goodfellow during the 2006 Maui Invitational. The Pumps were there to watch UCLA. Goodfellow was there to watch Memphis. The three hit it off. And the Pumps subsequently decided it would be fun to have Goodfellow, a guy who makes awesome commercials, help coach the premier team of their Pump N' Run stable. So they asked. He accepted. And there is still nothing better than watching Mike Krzyzewski and Roy Williams watch Mark Goodfellow coach future NBA players in a gym in Las Vegas.   Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Goodfellow."

CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,DDS8395,22,Mon Jul 20 23:39:24 2015 UTC,This is huge for Danny Manning and Wake Forest
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,sptagnew,8,Mon Jul 20 23:39:47 2015 UTC,Only if they land him.
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,ccantrell71,13,Mon Jul 20 23:44:01 2015 UTC,I disagree. Just the fact that we are back in the conversation for high profile recruits again is big for our program and proves that our program is finally starting to recover after the Bzdelik nightmare. We've gone from recruiting players like Rondale Watson and Andre Washington during the Bzdelik era to having a legitimate shot at some of the top recruits in the nation again with Danny at the helm.
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,sptagnew,19,Tue Jul 21 00:06:17 2015 UTC,How much of that is due to Harry being from Winston-Salem though? It only really makes a difference if you land the kid. A ton of high profile kids list hometown/home state teams. It only really matters if the kid commits. Just look at Illinois recently.
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,ccantrell71,8,Tue Jul 21 00:09:38 2015 UTC,"I still believe that it has more to do with the current coaching staff though. If Jeff Bzdelik was still the head coach, Giles would have cut us off of his list a long time before now regardless of being from Winston. I'm not trying to say that Giles listing us in his Final 5 schools is some program-changing event that will propel us to the ACC title regardless of Giles' decision of where to play, but rather that it's a sign that we are at least finally coming out of the recruiting hell we went through with Bzdelik."
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,craggium,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:32 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I think Giles is down to four if this is two years ago. The buzz (forgive the pun) around Winston was non-existent then, now it's definitely back and that's purely due to the head coaching change."
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,webster23,3,Tue Jul 21 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but I know Danny Manning has been making Giles a top priority since he got to Wake, I'm not sure if Giles was considering Wake before but Manning certainly has put in a lot of effort to show that Wake wants Giles, something I doubt very highly that Bzdelik would have been able to do. If Bzdelik was coach I would doubt Wake would be in his top 5 so yeah I think Manning has a lot to do with it."
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,alexdg22,4,Tue Jul 21 00:14:26 2015 UTC,Very possible. But it could also be like Saint Louis being in tatums top 5
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,dukebd2010,4,Tue Jul 21 00:19:52 2015 UTC,To me it doesn't matter. Wake needs to show it can compete for top recruits. They are in the #1 recruit's top 5. Whether or not it's because of where he's from doesn't matter. It's a good sign for other recruits to see.
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,flashcats,12,Tue Jul 21 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"Right, should of said this could be huge for Danny and WF."
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,DurhamIte,2,Mon Jul 20 23:52:51 2015 UTC,"For how poorly the program has been doing the last few years, just to be still in the race is pretty impressive."

CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,DrDoofenshartz,6,Tue Jul 21 00:59:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure Manning's extensive track-record of developing big-men is irrelevant.   Not saying he'd be considering Wake Forest if he wasn't from the area, but it's interesting that Giles is 6'10/230lbs, which is the listed height/weight for Manning from his playing days. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic because I want Manning to succeed, but I think Wake Forest is far from being an underdog in this deal. He may not get a chance at a national championship in one year at Wake Forest, but there's zero question in my mind that he'd show up to the NBA draft as a better player if he goes to WF for a year then he would for any of those other schools."
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,STFUandLOVE,4,Tue Jul 21 08:19:57 2015 UTC,"And because his best friend is Brandon Childress, WF commit and son of Wake legend Randolph Childress.  Also, playing on Chris Paul's teams and being the 2nd coming of Danny Manning.  I think he'll go to Duke, but Wake is being mentioned with a bunch of big recruits and Danny even had a good first class for 2015.  Wake is on the rise."
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,Bajeezus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:35 2015 UTC,"There was a great article on this sub a few days ago and addressed Danny's recruiting tactics. He showed side by side videos of himself and if Giles performing the same offensive post moves, defensive movements, commented on how similar their histories are - even down to injuries - and let Harry know that they are both the same and that Danny can lead him to become a greater player."

He had a kid this year and I'm sure he'll be ready to start making money.  Basically follow in Trevor Lacey's shoes and go pro early just to get paid, regardless of NBA expectations.    Haha, not sure how much Anya would really see the court.  Bam is the shot-blocker that Anya is, and much better athlete.    Also Wake will have 4* Crawford at PG with a year of starting experience and already have a PG in the 2016 class.  I know Smith Jr. will likely beat out Crawford, but he'll at least have competition."

Two first rounders in 3 years (TJ, Abu) versus 2 in the past like 15 (JJ Hickson, Hodge) is definitely a helpful trend with recruiting."
CollegeBasketball,3e0aoj,ClaudeLemieux,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"Ced Simmons was the 15th pick back in 2006.   I just hope our guys stop declaring early only to go undrafted (Powell, Costner, Leslie, Lacey).   Abu looked pretty damn good at the end of last year, but he's short by NBA PF standards and he can't shoot. He has some work to do if he wants 1st round draft consideration."

CollegeBasketball,3dyqzp,molemanwasright_,5,Tue Jul 21 04:59:10 2015 UTC,This is an accurate reflection of my feelings.   All the Dwayne Haskinses in the world wouldn't change the fact that he's a terrible coach.
CollegeBasketball,3dyqzp,MontereyJack144,3,Mon Jul 20 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"I wish we did get at least other Haskinses. Everyone but him seem to be committing elsewhere. sigh  He isn't our long-term coach, that's for sure. But I'm not sure there is someone better that wants to come here."
CollegeBasketball,3dyqzp,derp_terp,3,Mon Jul 20 23:38:35 2015 UTC,Holding out hope that Tino Ellis or Trevon Diggs stays home. Safe money is on Diggs to Bama though. :(
CollegeBasketball,3dyqzp,MontereyJack144,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:15 2015 UTC,Diggs postponing his announcement is definitely good news. We are keeping a (and should be excited according to some) coach around for what is essentially maybe a top 30 class and giving him a pass for this season (likely no bowl). That shouldn't be acceptable imo but there just isn't anyone that wants to come here long term.
CollegeBasketball,3dyqzp,derp_terp,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"I very strongly disagree about Diggs' postponement being good news. Haskins has sworn up and down that he and Diggs were a package deal. The fact that Diggs is still shopping around months after Haskins' commitment says that he's taking a long hard look at winning a championship at Bama and getting out from under his brother's shadow.  As for Edsall's merits, the numbers are there to document Edsall being a bad in-game coach, so I won't focus on that.  What concerns me is his recruiting. Say what you will about The Movement, but outside of Haskins and Adam McLean we've yet to see many big-name football recruits land at Maryland. Frankly, I think The Movement is (at worst) 50% Stefon Diggs, 15% being close to home, 15% our uniforms, and 20% the coaching staff. I despise James Franklin and PSU, but I can't help but wonder what our recruiting would be like if he had taken over after Friedgen left. How long has it been since a legit Dematha player picked Maryland? They're right next door, but they all move on to greener pastures.  I'm content to give Edsall a pass this season because I want to wait for the 2016 class, but I've been doing that since he got to campus. His contract extension says (to me, at least) that the higher-ups feel the same way. That extension was for recruiting appearances only, and that $500,000 buyout is there for when he caps out at 6-6, despite having a prodigious talent like Haskins at the helm."

While I was in school I always hated him because, well, I'm a Maryland fan, and recently he's said some pretty shit things about my university. The lack of respect for the basketball team, the Maryland fanbase, and the school as a whole was/is just astounding.  But I read a book about ACC basketball recently, and it had a lot of quotes and personal stories from Coach K. Granted, these interviews and stories were from the late 90's, but he really came across as an alright guy. Someone who I would respect as a person and adore if he was my team's coach. This came without the help of the author (he didn't try to paint a flattering picture) and despite my preconceived notions of the man. Meanwhile, Dean Smith (who the author seemed to bend over backwards to portray positively) came across to me as a pompous ass.   So that's my story.   Edit: Would probably be good form to name the book. It was ""A March to Madness: A View from the Court in the Atlantic Coast Conference"" by John Feinstein.

I still don't understand how winning a national championship warrants setting cars on fire.  *Edit - There are some salty MD fans in here. Nothing I said in this statement is false or unrelated to the conversation at hand. Md fans did riot and set the town on fire in as celebration for winning the national championship in 2002.   From this article:   Following the celebratory riot, 17 people were arrested, 6 police cars were damaged, over 16 fires had been set, two dozen were injured, and a Maryland state trooper was hit in the face with a plank. A night of bonfires, looting, drunken brawls, flying beer bottles and hundreds of troopers in riot gear caused roughly $50,000 in damages. The rioting was so bad, university officials later established a zero tolerance anti-rioting rule, meaning a student could be expelled if caught in acts of vandalism or violence after games.  Maryland, who has a history of rioting, had a similar riot a year earlier in a Final Four loss to Duke, when a bonfire set by fans caused $500,000 in damage. Rowdy fans smashed out storefronts, attacked police, and set fire to a mobile home."

CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,otherfuckinTerps,6,Mon Jul 20 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"Problem is that for many of the conference champions from the smaller conferences, it makes more administrative sense to play in the First Four.

No matter who you play, you still have to win the games to get in the tourney, so those that win their respective conference championships have earned the right to be in the Top 64."
CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,Boom_Baby31,4,Mon Jul 20 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"It also makes the first four better. If they allow the 4 16 seeds into the round of 64, then they can fill the 2 16 -16 games with better games. For example, Texas vs Temple could of happened last year instead of the 16-16 game."
CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,otherfuckinTerps,3,Mon Jul 20 19:11:36 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you, but there will always be the risk of a school like SMU getting left out of the 68.  A case could be made for 3 or 4 teams last year who probably deserved to be bumped in favor of SMU."

CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,amarner32,23,Mon Jul 20 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, having a field of 68 is dumb. Take it down to 64. It doesn't make sense for some 11 seeds to have to play an extra game, and it sure as hell doesn't make sense for conference champions to have an extra game.  There's no reason some teams should have to play more games than other teams."
CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,devilben02,7,Mon Jul 20 18:21:30 2015 UTC,"That ship has sailed. And I disagree that it doesn't make sense for some 11 seeds to have to play an extra game. It becomes a true play-in game for teams that didn't do enough during the regular season to earn a protected spot in the round of 64.   That said, I agree that a conference champion shouldn't have an extra game, but that was the deal that was struck to allow the 4 additional teams the chance to play in the tournament."
CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,justaverage,7,Mon Jul 20 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"They had 30+ play in games all throughout the season. They should've made their case then.   What about the next 4 teams?

CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,devilben02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:57 2015 UTC,"If their case was so clear after those 30+ games, why do we still have such debates over who deserves those last spots?  And you're right that someone on the outside will always think that they should have their shot as well. Maybe the tournament will expand again in the future to include 8 play-in games, or maybe all of the at-large bids will have to play their way in. We're not there yet, so I'm only commenting on the way in which the currently-adopted 68-team field is filled."
CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,an_actual_lawyer,3,Tue Jul 21 14:13:13 2015 UTC,"I personally think they should expand a bit and have 8 16s and 8 15s.  Have them play as part of a ""first 8"" and then hop into the brackets as normal.   It would give the Cinderella's a chance to win a game AND it might make the 1-16 and 2-15 games a bit more interesting because the 16/15 would have a bit of momentum coming in."
CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,amarner32,2,Mon Jul 20 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"At least there's logic in your method. The current method randomly punishes some 11 seeds, yet other 11 seeds and 12 seeds that were bubble teams don't have to play in the first four. Either go back to 64 teams or make it so every team of a certain seed has to play another round. There's no reason one 11 seed needs to win 7 games while another 11 seed only has to win 6."

They talk about the last four teams voted into the tournament field being what was used. Now they are using the last four at-large teams on the overall seed list. What about the other four teams? Unless I have completely brainfarted the whole thing, which is entirely possible, the first four is the first four GAMES (meaning eight teams)."
CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,cshenton,4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:07 2015 UTC,"I like the change regarding being able to move the best 2 seed out of the best 1 seed's region, even if it's their natural geographic regional.

CollegeBasketball,3dygj4,philnotfil,5,Mon Jul 20 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"The only fix they need is to make the 8 at large teams that are the last four in and the last four out.   That would get viewers.

CollegeBasketball,3dzubd,adesimo1,3,Mon Jul 20 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was watching the game. He must have been talking some serious smack or something cause the play wasn't a hard foul or anything... Of course he did butt heads with the other player earlier (they both earned technical fouls for that back and forth). The other player even shouted to Devo to meet him outside as he was escorted out of the building by security... The game was crazy exciting and fun, too bad things got heated. Baye Mousa made a huge block and the defense really clamped down at the end. Hopefully Devo keeps his nose clean, especially if the Army makes it to National TV in the last few games of the tournament."
CollegeBasketball,3dzubd,mmanultra,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"Of course he was talking smack. I'm pretty sure Devo starts every practice session with at least 10 minutes of ""your mother"" joke warmups. And he's perfected the ""holding his follow through and maintaining eye contact as he jogs backwards down the court after a made 3."""
CollegeBasketball,3dzubd,mmanultra,3,Mon Jul 20 21:57:29 2015 UTC,"I couldn't get over how the guy commentating on the stream kept bringing up Devo's ""swagger"",""audaciousness"", and how he jumped up on the scorer's table after he sunk the buzzer non-beater... seriously he mentioned it like a dozen times during both games they've played..."
CollegeBasketball,3dzubd,mmanultra,2,Mon Jul 20 21:46:39 2015 UTC,I'm just glad he was on our team. Because I would have hated him if he'd played for another Big East team. He would have been the kind of player that you just love to loathe.
CollegeBasketball,3dzubd,mmanultra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"He seems like a pretty cool guy off the court. He just came back to Syracuse to finish his degree, and he even mentored Kaleb Joseph while he was there to get his degree (before leaving for the tournament Devo was quoted saying Kaleb's development is still a ""process""). Something about playing the game of basketball gets him riled up"
CollegeBasketball,3dzubd,Scudstock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He's pretty much the exact opposite of Brandon Triche, though.  Here's Triche after hitting a game-winning shot.  And here's Triche after netting a 20/8/8 stat line.  Here's Triche after losing a heartbreaker.  Guy was a rock, in a very good way."

Marvel is a resilient company, but until Disney and the MCU it was not stable. How much long term support can they really offer?  Yes, work sucks, I don't get off at 5, it's Monday, and I'd much rather have these hypothetical discussions than do anything else."

WSU was in a unique position with more resources than the rest of the league, which made it even more disappointing when we sucked.  I was not a WSU fan before I went there.  I just think students should support the school the attend.  If top 10 is unrealistic then treat a conference title like a national championship.  College sports are local first.  National attention is fun but over-rated."

CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,buubaar,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"We think Beaty will do ok, long term.  It's just going to take a few years to rebuild the program.  Previouis coaches ran the program into the ground but that stops now."
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,Forestl,2,Sun Jul 19 21:49:18 2015 UTC,"I'd be crazy happy with 5 dubs in football. But ya I can't wait for basketball to start, I got student season tickets this year so I'll actually be able to go to the games. I'm honestly excited to see more Jameelion, I think he'll be one of the best players this year."

CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,heysuess,13,Mon Jul 20 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"At least it's not a UK fan who ran into him in Lexington. Besides, it's the off season. Shitposts are better than no posts."
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,Bladewing10,8,Sun Jul 19 20:34:22 2015 UTC,OP should at least add a trigger warning then.
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,Bob__Loblaw__,6,Sun Jul 19 21:11:56 2015 UTC,Tell me about it.  I  had to schedule an appointment with a therapist after seeing the pic.
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,DoctorSauce,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:32:54 2015 UTC,TRIGGER WARNING: May upset touchy Louisville fans.
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,CluckyCluckyDucky,-9,Mon Jul 20 00:27:17 2015 UTC,Did he slip you a hundo to help recruit for him?
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,compton_cityof,-2,Sun Jul 19 22:02:58 2015 UTC,"Having met him several times, it's fortunate you didn't get the chance to know him."
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,Weltal327,12,Mon Jul 20 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"I've only met him a couple of times, but he has always been great, and was particularly great to my dad when he was in the hospital sent him a letter and a signed basketball while he was fighting cancer."
CollegeBasketball,3duwr2,realbabysealclubber,3,Mon Jul 20 02:42:52 2015 UTC,I served him at Malone's a few years ago. Couldn't have been nicer.

CollegeBasketball,3e196i,tranquillo_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:10 2015 UTC,"That is a bad list.  I pretty much despise Kentucky, but if you're getting paid to write quality sports info, you should put your old man fever behind you an recognize who were the best.  AD is #1 and it's really not even close."
CollegeBasketball,3e196i,eyeknowu,4,Tue Jul 21 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you were born in 1995 then AD may be your #1 player.  You never saw Issel play.  The guy scored over 2000 points and averaged 26 points at UK then averaged 20 ppg as a pro.  No one belongs a head of Dan Issel at UK and I don't even care for UK."
CollegeBasketball,3e196i,literallyjohnromero,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"What a wanky ""I was around when basketball was created even though I'm in my 40s"" list. AD is #1, undisputed, and John Wall should be on the list. Sorry mothafucka!"
CollegeBasketball,3e19jl,Three-HolePunchJim,2,Tue Jul 21 04:35:14 2015 UTC,Michael Jordan Phil Ford Tyler Hansbrough James Worthy Lennie Rosenbluth Antawn Jamison Charlie Scott Billy Cunningham Sam Perkins Sean May
CollegeBasketball,3e19jl,6-8_Yes_Size15,5,Tue Jul 21 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or if Jordan hadn't become GOAT in the NBA, he wouldn't be No. 1 on this list?  I also think Brad Dougherty/Eric Montross deserve to be on over Sean May."
CollegeBasketball,3e19jl,jcobd,4,Tue Jul 21 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"There's a number of guys that should be there above May. Walter Davis, Larry Miller, Mike o koren, jerry stackhouse...  I understand that May was great his junior year and especially great during the tourney run but come on now..."
CollegeBasketball,3e19jl,6-8_Yes_Size15,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know my UNC history that well, but he seemed to be an odd choice."
CollegeBasketball,3e19jl,Last_Account_Ever,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this list is garbage if anyone actually bothers to look at stats.  Hansbrough and Rosenbluth (5th?!?!) had much better college careers than Jordan and Ford.  Next you'll see Shaq ahead of Pistol Pete on the LSU top 10..."
CollegeBasketball,3e19jl,6-8_Yes_Size15,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"Man, I can remember when the Sporting News was actually a real publication with integrity."
CollegeBasketball,3e19jl,snlutnas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jordan should be #1. If it's based on his pro career, then obviously yes, but based on college accomplishments, Hansbrough and Ford are clear 1 and 2."
