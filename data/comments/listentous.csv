listentous,3d2jkp,etherteeth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:32:07 2015 UTC,"I've been getting into a lot of ""oldschool"" rap lately, and happened across this song the other day. It doesn't seem to get a lot of airplay these days, but it's considered a classic of early rap and its influence has spread far and wide across many different genres. You know the hook from Biggie's ""Hypnotize""? It was taken from this song, almost word for word. You know that first song Miley Cyrus released after she went crazy? The one with the hook ""La Da Di Da Di, we like to party""? That sounds awfully similar to Ricky's opening line ""La Di Da Di, we like to party"". Everyone has sampled or referenced this song. Everyone. Everyone from NWA to Mariah Carrey to Mindless Self Indulgence. Even PSY, the dude who did Gangnum Style sampled La Di Da Di in a song.   What I find particularly striking about this song, though, is just how weird it is. Slick Rick's voice, style, and delivery are all so off-kilter compared with most emcees past or present, and it's pretty uncommon to hear raps that are set to beatboxing and nothing else. Speaking of beatboxing, Doug E. Fresh delivers in spades. The first time I heard this, granted I was driving and only half paying attention, I didn't even notice that the beats weren't electronically produced until midway through.   EDIT: To clarify why I referred to the track as ""oldschool"" in this post but ""new school"" in the genre tag, I meant ""oldschool"" as a catch-all term to mean rap that was recorded in the 90's or earlier. On the other hand, ""New School Hip Hop"" refers to a specific movement when rap started to move away from ""novelty songs"" (think Rapper's Delight) and towards a more socially and politically conscious sound, also accompanied by an increase in showmanship and bravado among rappers. This movement came around '83-'84 with early recordings from artists like Run-DMC, and ultimately ushered in what is now considered the ""Golden Age of hip hop"" that came in the late 80's."

Shortly after this falling out, he recorded a jam session and released it as an album called The End of the Game, which might be my favorite Acid Rock album of all time. Unfortunately, this period also represented Green's mental decline leading up to his threatening his accountant with a shotgun for sending him money.

Kode9's label Hyperdub is a great source for good dubstep, and has featured some serious electronic heavyweights such as Burial and Flying Lotus.

Once all the parts have come in it sounds like a complete piece and when they drop out again later on, it sounds like there is a hole in the music.

listentous,3bpj55,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"Daydream (Wallace Collection song):       ""Daydream"" is a song recorded in 1969 by the Belgian band Wallace Collection. It was composed by band members Sylvain Vanholme and Raymond Vincent, with David MacKay  who also produced the single.  The song is in the symphonic pop/rock genre, and uses strings and flutes. The song was a hit in mainland Europe, though popularity didn't make it to English speaking countries, despite its use of English lyrics. The song was covered several times, most notably by the Gunter Kallmann Orchestra in 1970.

The crumhorn was a common instrument used in Renaissance and (sometimes, as here ) Baroque instrumental music. They were popular among the common people and would commonly have been played on the streets or in pubs or at other informal gatherings just for fun. They loved the snarly, colorful sound that crumhorns produced, and they were a precursor to more modern wind instruments. It's a capped reed instrument, similar to a bagpipe, wherein the reed sits completely inside of the body of the instrument and is covered by a mouthpiece. Personally, I think they're glorious."

Slothrust is a group of three music students who studied jazz in school and decided to form a rock/metal band after graduating.

The title translates to ""The Sunken Cathedral"" and the piece is meant to evoke a scene from a folk tale of a mystical cathedral rising up out of the sea accompanied by singing mermaids/angels (don't remember which), before it ultimately sinks under the water once again.   Debussy was interested in alternate tonal systems, such as modes, and pentatonic, octatonic, and whole tone scales. In this piece he makes use of Lydian, Mixolydian, and Dorian modes, along with tons of doubling across multiple octaves with use of the piano's pedals to create a really otherworldly soundscape."

Unfortunately, since I don't speak or read mandarin, I don't know too much about the piece or artist, though I don't think that it's an original composition by the performer.   There is an extensive tradition of classical orchestral music in China, just like there is in the Western musical tradition. They use different, traditional instruments than what Westerners would associate with classical music (instruments that have existed in China for centuries), and slightly different intonation, but it's still recognizable as classical music. The instrument being played by the soloist in this video is called an erhu, and is one of the most common instruments found in Chinese classical music. It is a bowed instrument with two strings and a resonating chamber made out of wood and snakeskin. Interestingly, the bow is placed in between the two strings rather than on top of them and the instrument's range is kind of in-between a violin and a cello, similar to a viola. The accompanist is playing a Yangqin, which is similar to a hammered dulcimer and fills a similar role to a piano in Chinese classical music."

listentous,3as3o6,Arbitrus,2,Tue Jun 23 01:43:54 2015 UTC,"Toshiko Akiyoshi is a jazz pianist and band leader; she was one of the first big names in the modern Japanese jazz scene. She got her start during the US occupation in the 1950s and later became the first Japanese woman to study at Berklee College of Music. She's performed extensively in the US and Japan; many of her touring band are American, including her husband, saxophonist/flutist Lew Tabackin. Despite this, she never really became too well known in the US. She's performed with a number of different groups, including as a solo artist, The Toshiko Trio, and the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Big Band. Most of her music is fairly conventional jazz fusion stuff, but her best tracks (in my opinion) are ones in which she incorporates traditional Japanese music and instrumentation, though not many of these are available to stream and therefore post. Predictably, her music is difficult to get a hold of outside of Japan.   This is a track from one of her more well known albums, Kogun, released in 1974. My favorite song by her is the title track from the album, though I couldn't really find a good version of it to post here, but this song is excellent as well. It features Lew Tabackin on flute (and probably saxophone too) and has some kinda trippy spoken word stuff dubbed over top."

In this piece, Webern uses a compositional technique called Klangfarbenmelodie, which is a long German word meaning ""tone-color-melody"". What this means is that the ""melody"" of the piece does not come from the changing of pitches in a specific rhythmic pattern, but from the changes in instrumental timbre arranged in a canon across the entire orchestra."

listentous,3a45sz,hornwalker,5,Wed Jun 17 03:18:17 2015 UTC,"Schönberg's personal philosophy on it was actually quite interesting.   In the 1890s, his music was totally tonal and sounded a lot like Stravinsky and other late Romantic composers. From 1908 was when he began to delve into atonality, which, contrary to popular belief, is not exactly the same as 12-tone/serialism (he hadn't developed the 12-tone system until several years later). To him, tonality was some kind of baggage that he felt needed to be shed; tonality was an invented concept and was inadequate for the purest forms of expression. Starting around 1921 was when he had refined his 12-tone system (sometimes called ""dodecaphonic"") and then began to use it almost exclusively (I say ""almost"" just because I'm not 100% familiar with all of his works) in his new compositions and to teach it to his students.   So, why'd he come up with all this stuff? In atonality, which has basically no ""rules"" at all, the tonal ""rules"" of consonance and dissonance no longer apply, and, to Schönberg, after shedding these rules, you are free to express yourself more. Atonal music gave the composer a new vocabulary for expression. It might come as no surprise that his views on the matter were influenced by Sigmund Freud e.g. the idea of using the influence of one's subconscious in composition. He also felt the need to move away from ""civil"" emotions in music (love, patriotism, etc.) to more ""real"" feelings (depression, anger, lust, etc.). His music was referred to as Expressionism, or Expressionist and represented the extremes of emotion, tone, sound color. It might also come as no surprise that he struggled with depression himself, and you can glimpse this in his famous self portrait in which his skin is blue and the art style is abstract rather than a realistic depiction.   He worked in this state of extreme emotional expression for many years until he finally became exhausted with it and switched to the much more structured 12-tone system he had developed. So in many ways, the 12-tone system was his reaction to the extreme, almost chaotic expressionism he used in his atonal works. To be clear, though, 12-tone music is still atonal; there is no tonic and no tonality. The difference is in the way the music is structured. This turned out to be way longer than I intended it to be, so sorry if it came across as pedantic or whatever. I just like talking about this stuff.   TLDR: To Schönberg and his students, atonality was the only logical progression that music could take after people like Wagner and other late Romantic composers had pretty much done everything you could do within the constraints of traditional tonality. To Schönberg in particular, atonality was about pure, unfettered emotional expression. How listenable the music is, was beside the point. Personally, while atonal music is not really my favorite thing to listen to, I find it fascinating nevertheless."
listentous,3a45sz,hornwalker,2,Wed Jun 17 04:01:39 2015 UTC,I think part of the problem is the music us very difficult for performers so there aren't many moving performances.  The music can be extremely emotional.

It's from his Live in L.A. album, which was recorded in 1972 at a series of concerts.  Cocker is known for his awesome re-imaginings of classic songs and this is no exception. St. James Infirmary (sometimes called The St. James Infirmary Blues) is an extremely old jazz standard that has been covered tons of times by tons of people. The most famous version is probably by Louis Armstrong. Interestingly, Cab Calloway's song, Minnie the Moocher (of Blues Brothers fame), uses the exact same melody. Personally, its one of my favorite standards to play and to listen to. It's such an old song that no one really knows exactly who wrote it and it's theorized that it might be based off of an old English folk song."

listentous,39nof7,Arbitrus,3,Sat Jun 13 01:28:50 2015 UTC,"Morton Feldman was an avant-garde and minimalist composer active in the mid 20th century. He was friends with John Cage and their work influenced one another. Feldman is known for writing for unusual ensembles as well as for writing graphical scores which contain no notes, staves, key signatures, time signatures, or even anything that could be construed to be musical notation. In scores such as these, it is up to the performing musicians to interpret the symbols as they see fit. As such, performances are never exactly the same.   Rothko Chapel is probably Feldman's most well known and probably his most listenable piece, and, ironically, it is one of the only pieces he composed that used a conventional score and not a graphical one. It is written for celesta, bass drum, timpani, viola, and an SATB chorus. The piece was written as a tribute to his friend, the artist Mark Rothko, and was premiered at the chapel in southeast Texas that bears his namesake and features several of his paintings. The full piece can be heard here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZZ0DYIkaP8"

He was a well traveled composer and drew influences from many regions of the world where he was exposed to many of the new musical styles that had begun to emerge, especially outside of Europe. In particular, he lived in Brazil for several years, as well as in America, where he became very interested in jazz. He was a member of the Les Six group of French avant-garde composers, whose music is largely seen as a reaction against the extreme end of Romanticism found in Wagner, as well as against Debussy's Impressionism.   La Création du Monde (The Creation of the World) is an interesting mash up of his influences. The inspiration for the piece's composition came from the creation myths found in various traditional African religions, while the music was inspired by jazz ensembles, which can be heard in the instrumentation and the complexity of the intermingling musical lines. Scored for a small orchestra of mostly woodwinds, it was premiered as accompaniment to a ballet, but has since entered the standard orchestral repertoire, leaving the dance aspects behind."

It was recorded at OAO Studio in Brooklyn, NY and released as a 12"" single on the Celluloid label in 1982. This release and all subsequent pressings of the single feature two versions of the song, one on Side A and one on Side B. The official length of the tracks varies depending on the specific pressing of the single, with some releases mislabeling the running times entirely. The Side A version is 7:40 minutes in length and features Fab Five Freddy rapping in both English and French. He also performs the chorus of the song, utilizing a vocoder with a white noise carrier to achieve a gritty, robotic effect. The version of the song that appears on Side B is considerably shorter than the A-Side track, clocking in at 3:42. Aside from the chorus, which, like the Side A, was performed by Fab Five Freddy through the vocoder, the lead vocals are performed by female rapper Beside and rapped entirely in French, making this single one of the first multilingual hip-hop releases. Beside was credited as 'Fab 5 Betty' on the earliest pressings of the vinyl.

listentous,395v9o,heavym,2,Tue Jun 9 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"as i said, i don't know for a fact...   but i have tried to figure this out for a long time.  if you listen to the ""genuine basement tapes"", there are no songs that aren't sung by bob dylan.  when dylan and the band released the Basement Tapes album in 1975, my understanding is that the Band songs were all demos tacked on to the Dylan tunes to give it the impression that they were recorded in Big Pink.    Robbie Robertson is a bit of a ""fraud"" (if you are interested, Levon Helm's autobiography is awesome and is not very sympathetic to Robbie).  The wiki page - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Basement_Tapes_songs_(1975)#.22Katie.27s_Been_Gone.22 says that music writer Barney Hoskyns (MOJO, Melody Maker, New Musical Express) says that it was ""almost certain"" that it was recorded in the CBS studios in NYC.

She mostly does soundtracks for anime and, unfortunately, though her discography is extensive, a comparatively small amount of it is available in the US. She's one of the most versatile composers I've ever heard. Her background is in jazz and she's an excellent piano player, but she always adapts her music to whatever the demands of the show are. Her most famous pieces are from her soundtrack to the anime Cowboy Bebop and its subsequent film.  This is a piece from her soundtrack to the anime Earth Maiden Arjuna, which I'm not familiar with beyond its music. It features a saxophone ensemble, though I can't tell if it's being played in real time, or if it's multiple parts layered together. Either way, it's one of the most epic (if I can even still use that word un-ironically) sounding pieces of music I've heard."

The Incredible String Band were one of the most important groups in the development of psychedelic folk music, and the album from which this is taken (1968's The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter) represented both their highest level of commercial success (reaching an astonishing 5 in the UK album charts) and possibly their highest degree of critical success, with this song particularly being singled out as Mike Heron's 'masterpiece'. Though it could easily have been a chaotic mismash, the song (which Wikipedia memorably describes as 'a 13-minute reflection on life, love, and amoebas') holds together quite well both thematically and musically, though it will probably try the patience of anyone not already fairly tolerant of hippie bullshit.

Robert Hunter and Bob Weir didn't collaborate as songwriters all that often, but when it worked, it really worked. Lyrically, this is a vague, character-driven tale of betrayal and murder among thieves in a Western-era setting, alternating between a third-person narrator and a dialogue between the protagonists. Musically, it features one of Weir’s characteristically shifty melodic structures and a highly dynamic ebb-and-flow pattern of collective improv. All in all, it's one of the more dramatic and enduring country-rock ballads in American music, imo. This is the classic version from Europe '72."

listentous,38vf3n,Quietuus,3,Sun Jun 7 04:01:24 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a bit of a daring choice for what'll probably be my last one of this month. To many whose ears aren't particularly well attuned to noisy music, Ulver's 1996 album Nattens madrigal – Aatte hymne til ulven i manden (Madrigal of the Night - Eight Hymns to the Wolf in Man) probably sounds like so much screeching attenuated noise. But there's considerable critical consensus around this album, which is consistently hailed as one of the best black metal albums of all time, if not the best; though it takes some effort on the part of the listener to penetrate the extremely lo-fi production to hear the quality of the music beneath. This probably explains why it took some time for the impact of this album to be fully felt musically, though along with the other two albums in Ulver's 'black metal trilogy' (Bergtatt - Et eeventyr i 5 capitler and Kveldssanger) it is undoubtedly a strong influence on, for example, much of the crop of newer Cascadian black metal bands, such as Panopticon. The production, which stands in stark contrast to Ulver's previous album (the clean, acoustic Kveldssanger), is so notorious that it has been the subject, or perhaps the origins, of myths, the most persistent one being that the band spent almost the entirety of their record advance on luxury goods (Italian suits and cocaine are often mentioned) and recorded the album in the middle of the woods on an old 8-track. In fact, this rumour was probably started by their record company as a marketing stunt; there is some suggestion that the production decisions were partly a protest against the commercialisation of black metal, a genre of music Ulver would subsequently abandon. Personally, I think the ultimate effect is too precise to suggest that Ulver recorded anywhere but a studio: the liner notes credit Anders G. Offenberg, Jr. as an engineer. This person was also responsible for work on Limbonic Art's Moon in the Scorpio and Mysticum's In The Streams of Inferno (a very impressive record, in black metal terms) at around the same time, and it is probable that, as with these albums, Nattens Madrigal was recorded at the (now apparently defunct) Bondi Lydstudio in Oslo."
listentous,38vf3n,Miniukov,2,Sun Jun 7 04:18:28 2015 UTC,"I always wondered what happened with this album. Started listening to Ulver with Perdition City, so when I heard this I was like ""wtf...o0"", I assumed that it was old mix tape or something(Mainly because of sound quality, I knew that they experiment a lot with genre). I always just skipped it, but now maybe will try listening to it with what you said in mind. Thanks"

listentous,38u8pw,andrewcooke,2,Sat Jun 6 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was also pleasently surprised by the album's more 'open' approach ;) Might be the start of a new direction. In an interview they explained their usual recording process as much more planned than concerts, adding and subtracting different parts in the studio. Whereas live, they're one of the tightest bands I've seen (eerily thelepathic), especially considering that they started from scratch, and then improvised during two 45 min. parts, building tension and atmosphere throughtout. Not to say I don't enjoy the albums though, they can be more of a meditative, ambient experience as you said."

Some fine soul has put every song they ever made on youtube (all 13 of them), so that's some comfort. In good folk fashion, their album is stuffed full of covers of other folk revival acts (such as this song, originally by Pearls Before Swine, and a lovely rendition of Crazy Man Michael) and hymns (the jesus-wants-me-for-a-sunbeam classic Lord of the Dance).

While much of the compilation is focused on the music of vocalist Amadou Ballaké, I think this obscure funk track is just great, with exciting wah-wah'd instrumentation, an irresistible groove, and some beautiful female backing vocals.

Saul Williams skillfully takes the meta-approach, and over a beat-box condemns drum machines in favor of more traditional production - ""as if a heart-beat was not enough"".

In the 1970s, he recorded with two different bands, with overlapping personnel. One was the Vis-A-Vis band, based in Kumasi and led by Isaac Yeboah. Their album Obi Agye Me Dofo was released in Ghana on the Probisco record label, and was later reissued on the Makossa International label. The second band was the Cubano Fiestas, who recorded the album K. Frimpong and His Cubano Fiestas in 1977 for the Ofori Brothers label. The album contained the track ""Kyenkyen Bi Adi M'awu"" for which Frimpong is best known. He then recorded at least two other albums with the Cubano Fiestas: Me Da A Onnda (1980), and K Frimpong, both released in Ghana on the Polydor label.  Frimpong died on October 18, 2005 in Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana."

I discovered Morbus Chron in one of the best ways possible; by seeing them live, as part of a gloriously packed line-up at the Oobleck in Birmingham, alongside At The Gates, Triptykon and Code Orange. The only band I hadn't heard before, and the only one apart from Code Orange I hadn't seen live, I was blown away by Morbus Chron's live performance, to the point where I immediately went and bought a shirt from their merch stand between sets. Live, they were like being transported back to a Stockholm basement some time during the mid 90's, giving me a strong vibe of very early Dark Tranquility or the middle period of Edge of Sanity. Whilst their first offering, 2011's Sleepers in the Rift is quite reminiscent of early US Death Metal (Death and Autopsy seem to be the touchstones most reviewers reach for), 2014's Sweven is where the old Scandinavian influence comes out to play, though their album persona is a lot more spacious than their live performances. Often, progressive death metal tends to get bogged down in excessive technicality, to the point of becoming unmusical, but Sweven holds a good balance throughout, showing some well deployed originality whilst still retaining some of that throwback charm through a production that remains mercifully unravaged by the dead hand of digital compression. The result is an excellent 50 minutes of music, particularly if you like old school melodic death metal. Which I do. Quite a lot. It's worth listening to in full."

It depicts the end of an ancient civilization residing in Central America, but with mythical roots extending back to Egypt and beyond. It is the last flowering of a mystical and mythological culture which was slowly destroyed by our modern world. In this case, Scelsi says, the Mayans made a conscious decision to end the city themselves. Uaxuctum incorporates harmonic elements throughout, and is extremely difficult to come to terms with.

Apparently feeding off the perennial interest of many involved in the doom metal scene with late 60's and early 70's, starting in about the mid-to-late 00's, with bands like The Devil's Blood, Ghost and Blood Ceremony, bands began to tap not just the aesthetic, but the sound of artists who, though they cast a certain formative influence over the heavy metal genre, had been passed by in terms of sonics by the relentless cult of Black Sabbath; bands like Coven, Blue Oyster Cult and Black Widow. The result is music that is quite easy on the ears, despite its lyrical exploration of black magick, devil worship, witchcraft and so on. Purson are not part of the first wave of such bands, forming in 2011, though they were almost instantly able to make a good enough showing that they got on the billing for 2012's Roadburn Festival before having actually released an album."

listentous,36bvmw,Quietuus,3,Mon May 18 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"Cromagnon's 1969 album Orgasm, and particularly this first track, are often cited, in certain circles at least, as textbook examples of bands being bizarrely ahead of their times. Actually, I would personally disagree with this sort of assessment; you can find most of the constituent elements of Cromagnon's weirdness, in, for example, Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (a UK chart success in the same year), though admittedly in much more subdued form, and the particularly blending here definitely sounds like something that really doesn't belong in 1969; comparisons to industrial music (the combination of bagpipes and overbearing percussion is indeed eerily reminiscent of Test Dept. at times) and black metal (with regards to the vocals) are common. Cromagnon definitely had a sinister and deranged edge to their hippie weirdness that set them very much apart; they can definitely be said to be ahead of the game in how far they were willing to break from conventional musicality, and for such long periods, on an ostensibly popular record, and there's several tracks on this album that I definitely wouldn't want to encounter under the influence of deleriant drugs, that's for sure. The relative lack of information about the band (this was their only album) has lead to all sorts of fun rumours swirling about them over the years, the main one being that the album was recorded by a mysterious hippie commune called 'The Connecticut Tribe' that included future members of The Residents and Negativland. In fact, all evidence seems to suggest that, perhaps even more strangely, the album came about as a one-off experiment from members of an unremarkable pop-rock group called The Boss Blues, just fucking around in a studio in New York."

Rome are a band from Luxembourg that operates within a 'martial' aesthetic, a dark soundscape influenced by industrial music and early 20th century history; however, whereas many bands which operate in this aesthetic have explicit leanings towards the far right politically, Rome instead seems to draw more to the far left, though never too obviously, at least to an English speaker. They are also a lot more interesting musically than many other bands in this field, which can often seem over-crowded with fairly pedestrian material, with bands often seeming to do little more than consciously imitate their rivals. Rome's music is, above everything, beautifully crafted; each element is put together with a very careful and deliberate sensibility. Little ever feels out of place; this is remarkable considering that a lot of their music hinges around the melding together of hard, sometimes discordant sounds with softer, harmonious ones, a trick which can be very hard to pull off. This track focuses mostly on the more beautiful side of their music, with a structure that builds on itself and relaxes, providing a perfect backdrop for Jérôme Reuter's voice, which is one of the band's chief assets."

He's been compared (by Robyn Hitchcock) to a 'male Kate Bush', and has been credited as the first 'steampunk' musician, long before steampunk was an extant cultural concept. Syd Barrett's solo material is another useful comparison, though he's rarely so willfully psychedelic. I'm not sure 'steampunk' is entirely accurate, though Roland's music often deals with obscure Victorian and Edwardian themes, sometimes directly referencing some obscure pop culture phenomena (Spring-Heeled Jack, The Crimes of Dr. Cream) or sometimes weaving his own pulpy tales (The Mind of William Gaines, Cousin Emilia). His music is often (morbidly) humorous (Knights, The Curate of Cheltenham) and always has a whimsical air, even when dealing with serious, even tragic matter (The Poets and the Painters, Burnt Orchids). His victoriana obsession can get a bit overbearing at times (such as when he writes his own flash song, entirely in 19th century criminal slang), but if his work clicks with you, his fairly extensive discography is worth checking out."

True to its name, the trio revels in the pitch black, yet continually discover beauty and shed light through sonic exploration."" - from their official website"

'Our Darkness', from 1984's Joined Up Writing, is pretty much her signature song; a great slice of 80's weltschmerz, almost exorbitant in its dreary glumness, the bitterness of the lyrics contrasting strangely with the song's inherent danceability. A lot of Anne Clark's appeal, to me, comes in the way she blends together elements that shouldn't really quite work together; one part Laurie Anderson, one part New Order, one part John Cooper Clark, chuck in a saxophone solo, blend."

The SOUND of this album is fantastic, if you love modern Americana then this is a classic. The production is probably my favorite that Steve Albini has ever worked on.  Of course the lyrical content is the centerpiece here. Molina had his own well documented struggles, but the ones he sings about are almost universal in their intimacy. The arching theme here is holding out hope and strength when facing demons who haunt you at every corner. Anybody can relate to the writing in this album.  It's such an inspiration to me and is a huge comfort for the darker times in life. Thank you Jason, this is one hell of a farewell transmission."

I'm sure they would know their cues even playing in different rooms planets. But that's part of why their music can be so sublime: they work as an unit. They're playing for an audience, but their delivery is like there was nothing else in the world but the two and their music. They nod and smile and frown; they seem to be challenging eachother, at the same time they never forget that their force is in the sum of their sounds. Largely ignored by the general public, they've been finding trust and strength in eachother to keep going forward, mesmerizing anyone interested enough to stop around.

The youtube description is on point, so I'll copy + paste it here.   Performed (Arp synthesizer) and recorded by Eliane Radigue; Robert Ashley, English voice; Lama Kunga Rinpoche, Tibetan voice  Double CD of all 5 of Radigue's songs in tribute to the Tibetan saint and poet from the eleventh century. Two of the tracks date from an 1983 LP (Radigue's first release), two are previously unreleased and the final 62-minute track was previously issued as a sole CD in 1987. The material is performed by Radigue (synthesizer and recording), Robert Ashley (English voice) and Lama Kunga Rinpoche (Tibetan voice). Radigue was born in France and has studied under Pierre Shaeffer and Pierre Henry; her musical has an extremely organic and mystical electronics vibe, and has been previously documented on Phill Niblock's XI label, as well as Metamkine and Lovely.  Milarepa is a great saint and poet of Tibet who lived in the eleventh century. His autobiography, the Mila Kabum or Namthar, as told to his closest disciple, Rechungpa, has been translated into several Western languages. In this story of Milarepa's life, we can see how, through years dedicated to meditation and related practices in the solitude of the mountains, subjecting himself to the severest form asceticism, Milarepa achieved the highest attainable illumination and the mental power that enabled him to guide innumerable disciples. His ability to present complex teachings in a simple, lucid style is astonishing. He had a fine voice and loved to sing. When his patrons and disciples made a request or asked him a question, he answered in spontaneously composed free-flowing poems or lyric songs. It is said that he composed 100,000 songs to communicate his ideas in his teachings and conversations.  The large collection of stories and songs, the Jetsun Gurbum, was translated first into English by Garma C. C. Chang. There is also a rare, little known collection, Stories and Songs from the Oral Tradition of Jetsun Milarepa, which existed in an oral state longer than the other works. Drinking the Mountain Stream (Lotsawa Publications), from which the songs on this album were taken, is the first English translation of these texts, made by Lama Kunga Rinpoche and Brian Cutillo.  Lama Kunga Rinpoche has kindly agreed to record his singing in Tibetan, and Robert Ashley has given his voice to the English translation of these songs."

listentous,2znv68,JustAsLost,3,Fri Mar 20 03:28:03 2015 UTC,"What's kind of ironic about the whole snobbishness thing is that (as I know from personal experience with friends) some music snobs are so snobby that they never try out something ""popular"" and often miss out on great opportunity. I think there's an element of, perhaps, duty that stands in the subconscious of us music snobs. We go out into the abyss of obscurity to return with electic fruits of our labor that are challenging yet rewarding to the palet. Elements of this are simply for bragging rights and the social value that may have, others are about giving (which of course always has its survival benefits as well). Without getting unnecessarily deep (if I hadn't already) I think it is important to give everything a try. We are fighting the good fight remember, and in the struggle lets not forget that sometimes we win and music changes. Be sure not to miss a chance to reinforce that evolution and not stunt it with our reflexes of harumph'dum. Believe it or not things of quality do reach commercial success sometimes.

""#320"" is a minimalistic, cinematic, droning piece from Pan Tone, the album that capture a live collaboration between german prepared-piano tinkerer Hauschka and icelandic experimental cellist Hildur Guðnadóttir. Using the sea as a theme, the musicians' improvisation seem to complement eachother perfectly: Hauschka is playful and curious, while Hildur is dark and solitary. So it's hard to tell if ""#320"" is a dreamy swim along dolphins or the last moment of calm before you die through drowning. Either way, it's a deep, thoughtful, and relaxing journey."

They, the others, are too busy inventing their own sounds and just don't have time to pay tribute to their contemporaries by echoing their music. And this is a healthy sign.   A new group named ""Ford Theater"" has come forth with an excellent excursion into sound with ""Trilogy for the Masses"". The music ranges from hard rock (they call it dramatic rock) to folk themes.

In 2004 both musicians — plus Josh Klinghoffer on drums — got together for two weeks and composed and recorded 10 songs, that became Automatic Writing (2004) and AWII (2007). If it feels like a jam band, it's because that's pretty much accurate: Lally would present a looping, pulsating bass line; Josh would develop drumming patterns; and Frusciante, well, he'd do his thing on top of that. The result is a hypnotic and groovy concoction that ranges from stoner-grunge tunes to blues-noise rock, without missing a beat or caring too much. It's music that gives more than it asks for, and for that it's just really damn enjoyable."

It goes on, allowing you to be comfortable, to be taken together; it's warm and inviting. By the time the acoustic guitar gives place to a piercing guitar solo, the lyrics warn: ""I know you'll hear me now...You missed your way out"". As the arrangement gets more complex and the tension rises, the drummer let you know that things are gonna get rough. Riffage abound and heads bang. The bridge after the the heavy section is not the sunlight after the storm, but just a breather. It'll end differently than it started. It changed in its path. We did too. With its love for great storytelling and knowing no genre boundaries, maudlin of the Well blew up the mind and musical limits of people everywhere. It still does. There's nothing quite like it.

Om has some great eastern sounding experimental songs. Somehow Om reminds me of Earth.  Matt pike might be my favorite  guitarist, and High on Fire is in my opinion the best metal band around today"

We do apologize for the extremely low quality of tonight's feature but it's somehow slightly fitting that the record label won't let us have it in a better quality that 240px. Out of 2001's Supermogadon, Baby M is a brilliant reimagination of Kenny G's Baby G. Marumari was Josh Presseisen and Sasha Ellms from Albany, NY until they decided to marry, have children and be generally happy without making music. Many, including me, miss them dearly."

listentous,2yd8c0,impop,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:16:19 2015 UTC,"If you happen to be lost walking in the streets of the Barrio Gótico in Barcelona, near the Cathedral you may be swept by a sound that it's old and new at the same time; that is dreamy and sophisticated and seems to paint the imposing medieval walls with a warm, cozy feeling. You'll easily recognize the sound of the saxophone, and you'll be able to find the cello, but there's a third instrument, some sort of percussive sound with a ""velvet"" reverbed quality that doesn't quite... exist? The streets are short and full of corners but if you allow your ears to lead you, you'll find a band playing music that is so hauntingly beautiful that it almost doesn't seem right to be fighting with the murmurs of the busy streets. You won't think twice about stopping around, closing your eyes, and let yourself get immerse in the sound a little. Then smile to the musicians with overflowing gratitude, and just buy and hold the CD as if it was the valuable relic of an archeologist. And as you float walk away you might think, wasn't that pure passion for music what I witnessed?"
listentous,2yb9a7,Quietuus,2,Sun Mar 8 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"For my last song (for the moment, anyway) I thought I'd go with an absolute favourite of mine. One of the most unique, intriguing and musically accomplished products of the British neofolk scene, Sieben consists mostly of Matt Howden, a violin and a bank of loop and effect pedals. Each song is built up progressively from loops produced on the violin; bowing, plucking, strumming, tapping and rubbing; watching him play live is a real joy.   This particular song is quite possibly my favourite work by him, despite an extensive discography that includes albums by Sieben, as a solo artist and other a variety of other names and in combination with other musicians. Howden's music deals with a broad array of topics, though this album, 2003's Sex and Wildflowers, treads a familiar territory to fans of this area of music; sex, death and their confluence in the natural sublime. This standout track encapsulates the albums title perfectly in its lyrics, which consist of a series of erotic metaphors (not quite double entendres) revolving around British wildflowers. Languid and evocative, this to me is pure audial pleasure.  It's been a pleasure posting tracks for this round of submissions. I've enjoyed the submissions of others, and found a few new artists; I hope some people have found or rediscovered some music through my posts. I'm sure I'll try my hand at other rounds of elections in the future; I don't think I'm in this round, but I wish all the best to those who do get picked. Looking forward to some great music."
listentous,2y8rv9,EastHastings,3,Sat Mar 7 14:58:31 2015 UTC,Time (The Revelator) is an incredible album as a whole.

listentous,2y8rv9,hippofountain,2,Sun Mar 8 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"Gillian Welch is one of the best voices to come along in country and folk music, and this 15 minute track is a stellar example of her work. It reminds me a lot of Bob Dylan's Visions of Johanna, which is never a bad thing."
listentous,2y7ray,Quietuus,2,Sat Mar 7 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"A side-project of the 'power electronics' project Sutcliffe Jügend, Bodychoke continues that projects musical obsession with the mental landscape of perverts and serial killers, but in a somewhat simpler and subtle way; at the very least, Bodychoke is much more actually listenable than certainly early Sutcliffe Jügend material (which consists mostly of Kevin Tomkins screaming explicit sexual threats over churning vortexes of white noise). The different approach allows not only for a much greater sonic range, the downbeat, atmospheric tracks like 'From Hell' and 'Skinflick' contrasting well on the album it comes from, (1996's Five Prostitutes), with the viciousness of tracks like 'Whore' and 'Cripple'; with the unpleasant 'How Much Can You Take' somehow managing to do everything that early Sutcliffe Jügend material seemed to be striving for.   This is the sort of music which can be unpleasant to listen to not only an aural level, but even on an actual moral or even spiritual level, which is what I think makes it most fascinating. One thing that can definitely be said in its favour is that it does not try and glorify or glamourise sexual violence or outpourings of hate. A lot of people, I think, might get hung up on the question of whether the voice in which these songs are sung is a character, or more an authentic expression of Tomlinson or others. I personally don't think that's an interesting question, though I understand why it is asked. It remains a convincing psychological study in any case, and to me has a similiar appeal of a peek into the abject that's offered by some very good crime fiction. Like good crime fiction, the ornamentation (here, the music, there, the prose) serves primarily to enhance the aesthetic effect; it does not draw a veil over the unpleasantness, but instead gives it a vehicle to penetrate more deeply."

listentous,2y3bs1,Catch_yer_own_train,2,Fri Mar 6 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"You know, as I started this round, I ran out of song ideas after the first freaking submission. Every song felt too popular, or not good enough, or too cliche. I nearly submitted Moondog and Exuma tracks until I noticed them staring at me over the submission form. So I dug. Into genres I normally avoided, great recent releases I had overlooked, and stuff I hadn't listened to in years, which I suppose this could fall into as well. And as it's ending, I'm realizing I don't have enough days to post all the stuff I want to post.  There were some great submissions here that really stuck with me too. Megadelta got Easy by Micachu & The Shapes stuck in my head for quite a while, and introduced me to what's probably my favorite instrumental surf rock song (outside this one). Nitraniar got me into Hellfyre Club for a while, making it hard submit something that wasn't milo or OME.  Anyways, this is a song that I freaking love off an album that is the very epitome of hit and miss. This video for some reason plays the song twice, which is convenient, because it's one of those songs that you want to hear again as soon as it finishes."

listentous,2y29by,Quietuus,2,Thu Mar 5 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"O.L.D. (Old Lady Drivers) began life as a comedy grindcore band called Regurgitation (not to be confused with the Swedish goregrind band Regurgitate). Changing their name after signing with Earache (always up for taking a chance with bizarre comedy metal bands, having released albums by such luminaries as Lawnmower Deth and Crotchduster) they immediately became a lot stranger. 1991's Lo Flux Tube, which features the talents of John Zorn (of Naked City fame) on saxophone as a guest musician, is the last jumping off point before 1993's bizarre (and highly divisive) The Musical Dimension of Sleastak. Subdued by comparison, Lo Flux Tube mixes moments of the classic driving industrial metal sound of bands like Godflesh with psychedelic influences and moments of genuine, turn-the-moshpit-into-a-blender whiplash freakout music."

They recorded music together in the early 90s but they got dropped by their label because they lacked commercial appeal. Their collaboration was cut short when Charizma was tragically murdered in 1993. Peanut Butter Wolf didn't release their work together until 2003, but it's some of the best old-school West Coast rap I've heard, with really fun and light-hearted beats and lyrics."
listentous,2xuwxt,Quietuus,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"1964's Folk Roots, New Routes is one of the defining artefacts of the 1960's British folk revival. A collaboration between Shirley Collins, one half of the Collins sisters and one of the best woman folk singers of the time (second only really to Anne Briggs in my mind, and that's no insult) and Davy Graham, whose influence over subsequent fingerstyle guitar playing is difficult to overstate. This is 'real' British folk music (i.e. substantially, though not wholly, derived from traditional lyrics, tunes and arrangements) at its absolute best."

listentous,2xomb5,Quietuus,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"Current 93 are one of the three 'big names' of British neo-folk, and are by far the nearest to mainstream consciousness. This is probably due to a variety of reasons, not least of which must be considered the extent to which Death in June and Sol Invictus remain tainted by associations with far-right politics. Though this is not something Current 93 escapes entirely, the consistency of Dave Tibet's visionary explorations of apocalypse, mortality and damnation over the 30 years the band has been in operation carry a certain guarantee of authenticity; it is difficult to claim that this is a man with some sort of hidden ulterior motive. A string of high profile collaborations has helped raise the band's profile particularly in later years; recent albums have featured a diverse cast including Marc Almond, Antony Hegarty, Nick Cave, Sasha Grey and Andrew WK (!); it should be pointed out, before there are too many thoughts of a novelty troupe, that Nick Cave's association with the band stretches back to 1996's All The Pretty Little Horses (Cave and Tibet doubtless finding some common ground in their interest in Christian esotericism) and Dave Tibet released Antony and the Johnsons first album through his label Durtro.  Coming 10 years into Current 93's unsettling musical journey, Lucifer Over London came hot on the heels of the rather subdued (at least musically) Of Ruine Or Some Blazing Starre, and though it starts gently enough (the musical quotating of Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid' aside) this title track soon finds Dave Tibet reaching peaks of frantic intensity that hadn't been quite seen since 1988's Earth Covers Earth. The combination of the hypnotic sounds of the guitar and backing vocals with Tibet's near-breakdown performance is classic Current 93, and this song is a defining work of the band's early 90's period, seeming to have crept back into live sets increasingly over the last few years."
