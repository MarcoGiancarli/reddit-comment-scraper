KendrickLamar,3cp3mh,SandJA1,2,Thu Jul 9 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"Heck. Yesss! Though, I feel like the vox are buried and snare is a little too high in the mix at the beginning. Perhaps mix a duplicate track with NYComp would help? Also maybe either a high-pass or scooping some mid-lows out from the vox would help them rise above? Also, maybe some clipping around the 3:40-4:10min mark. Any way to remix?  Awesome work though. Will you be playing it live?  NVM! I listened to this on a new computer and forgot that Windows comes with some shitty ""sound enhancement"" bullshit feature on as default. It sounds MUCH better now that I've turned that off. I hate that crap. Lemme hear how it actually sounds! Anyway... I still think the vox are still a smidge too low but that could just be personal preference.  Anyways.. good work! Thanks for sharing! Also, thanks for providing the kick to get me to realize that feature was on. I might've mixed some music with it on not knowing it actually sounds like shit. :)"

KendrickLamar,3cnr3j,GrandmaFetish,5,Thu Jul 9 15:59:21 2015 UTC,Kendrick feels like he had to live a sacrificial life due to being raised in Compton. He had to walk away from the drugs and violence that all his friends engaged in in order to be a positive influence in the world.
KendrickLamar,3cnr3j,Forever_Flaccid,4,Thu Jul 9 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, I'd suggest that he could mean he was forced to suffer in the name of higher ideals. Human sacrifice is usually associated with religion, particularly those considered more ""savage"" or ""warped"" by the West, (think ancient Aztecs).    In Kendrick's case, the hood idealizes drug use, gang violence, getting money by questionable means, to the point that the pursuit of these things is almost a religion. Kendrick nearly dies as a result of the cocaine-laced blunt (""Don't you feel bad, I'll probably sleep and never ever wake up""). His friend who dies at the end of Swimming Pools does in fact suffer this fate. Although they could change their behavior, Kendrick argues, they continue to put themselves and their friends at risk (sacrificing them, in effect) to these ""Gods"" of Compton."

So the sound quality wouldn't be too different from the CD version. But it really depends on how you personally like to listen to albums."
KendrickLamar,3cfc5n,czech-out,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. I'll shell out more than double the money I would spend on the deluxe CD, so perhaps I'll just cop the latter. Do you know anything about the digipak edition I was talking about, though? Thanks"
KendrickLamar,3cfc5n,czech-out,0,Tue Jul 7 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I do remember seeing a digipak version of it when I was last in Paris. This might be it (it's the website of the store I found it in): http://musique.fnac.com/a4758463/Kendrick-Lamar-Good-kid-M-A-A-D-city-Digipack-CD-album"

I also bought a t-shirt from them and the actual design is printed a lot lower than the preview of the design on the site.   I only bought from them twice so idk, it's possible I just got unlucky twice.   Message me if you have any other questions."

KendrickLamar,3c1le1,seli93,4,Fri Jul 3 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"He said he is planning on a world tour on twitter a few months ago. I wouldn't be surprised if he's waiting for both Jay and Q to release their albums, and maybe since A$AP hasn't toured the US all four of them can go on a huge tour together. Another theory I have is once Kanye releases his album this fall he'll take Kendrick on with him again. But who knows it's all speculation at this point."

KendrickLamar,3bx8da,tix20,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"Kendrick is going all natural with his hair, he doesn't care, his hair isn't rapping, or writing, he is. It's all in his interview when he went to South America and got the idea for the album in 2012, he said all there hair there is all natural, meaning they didn't care about hair lines, or fades, or things like that, they just wore it like African American people will wear there hair without haircuts, these days in 2015, people would be called ""bummy"" or ""nappy"" if they wore it like that, but it's just his hair, I personally love it.

KendrickLamar,3bx6so,imshady11,6,Thu Jul 2 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'd put it right after The Blacker the Berry. I think sonically it would work well, 'Untitled' starting out with that smooth, silky keyboard right after The Blacker the Berry's jazzy outro. Thematically I think it would fit in pretty nicely as well, it coming in after two previous songs dealing explicitly with race. 'Complexion' is about with a black person's struggle with self-image, 'The Blacker the Berry' is about the relationship between the black community and a society which favors whiteness and has historically treated blacks as second class citizens, while 'Untitled' seems to speak on the bond between all races: Asian, Native American, White, Black, etc."

KendrickLamar,3bof61,Swailem95,7,Tue Jun 30 23:38:59 2015 UTC,Probably wrong but I don't think its a full song. It references TPAB so I'd assume it would be a single that came out after?
KendrickLamar,3bof61,Chajj,3,Wed Jul 1 00:40:23 2015 UTC,It most likely is a track that didn't make the cut or just something they made to mess around with.

Just sack it dude, pre-roll joints and blunts before the concert and then double ziploc bag them . One bag to hold the blunts and joints and the other so your friends won't get grossed out touching the bag that was in your privates. You can take a pipe if you can fit it too. I recommend you use briefs as they are like compression shorts in the way that they are tight on you, therefore it doesn't slip out on the side of your leg or something . Edit: P.S His concerts are dope as shit but I recommend being as close as possible as usually the biggest fans are in the front therefore guaranteeing a turn up.

KendrickLamar,3bgp9e,kysz,5,Mon Jun 29 03:14:27 2015 UTC,"Anyone else confused by his omission of the ""40 acres and a mule"" line?  Also any time he mentions money he left it out? It was just weird. Like in the line ""Pretty pussy and benjamins is what I like"" I understand not saying pussy but he didn't say benjamins either. And he skipped the word zero in the line ""I deposit every other zero"". Does anyone know why he does that?"
KendrickLamar,3bgp9e,tightastic,4,Mon Jun 29 04:32:33 2015 UTC,He does it a lot I feel like in his most of his performances. I don't like it.  His best live performance that I've seen thus far is These Walls on Ellen. An awesome intimate performance where he didn't skip any words trying to get the crowd into it. I actually highly dislike when anyone skips lyrics.
KendrickLamar,3bgp9e,ThatDoodch,4,Mon Jun 29 04:49:26 2015 UTC,"I'll preface by saying, I could be completely wrong here, but.... if you put yourself in the shoes of any performer, especially one of Kendrick's caliber, while in the midst of a performance, you're going to get caught up in the energy, and no amount of rehearsal can prepare you for taking a few breaths here and there. Besides even if he does skip a line every so often during a show.... we gone be alright."
KendrickLamar,3bgp9e,Infinite_Lurker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:07:48 2015 UTC,Yeah this isn't the first time I've seen him omit the 40 acres and a mule line on live TV and I'm just as confused as you. It's a powerful line.

KendrickLamar,3bc031,FabbyTheBomb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:02:46 2015 UTC,Kendrick performed cartoons and cereal and alright
KendrickLamar,3b1mqp,falcaonpunch,11,Thu Jun 25 06:14:49 2015 UTC,"This is easily in my top 3 Kendrick songs. It is so upbeat, even tho it might not be about happy things, and I love singing along every time I hear it. This is the kind of catchy, but also lyrically clever, songs I want to see on his next album."
KendrickLamar,3b1mqp,4_20_blazeit_dot_gov,4,Thu Jun 25 07:01:04 2015 UTC,Exactly why it's one of my favourites too! Even though the subject matter is kinda sad I often play this song when I start the day because it feels so uplifting and it's so catchy. Always puts me in a good mood.
KendrickLamar,3b1mqp,flackohowyoubeen,10,Thu Jun 25 07:25:33 2015 UTC,"AAAWWWW SHIT NIGGA  Love this song, one of my favs from Section 80. The intro, the beat.. Just overall great. Can I suggest ''World Negatives''? That song is just fire.."
KendrickLamar,3b1mqp,kingkdot,6,Thu Jun 25 12:56:32 2015 UTC,This was the first Kendrick song I ever heard and the reason I started listening to him.
KendrickLamar,3b1mqp,IpHobo,3,Thu Jun 25 19:13:07 2015 UTC,I love this song might be my favorite on section 80. To me the title might be the most interesting aspect of the song. Of course its widely believed that Reagan pushed crack to ghettos so it's interesting that it has the sub tittle his evils. The first time I heard the song I just assumed that his evils were Reagan's. I now believe he's talking about the evils of males in Compton.

KendrickLamar,3ama4r,Tomoromo9,5,Mon Jun 22 06:25:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's a fantastic song, I wish it at least made it onto the bonus disc"
KendrickLamar,3ama4r,dan0314,6,Mon Jun 22 15:54:52 2015 UTC,I think it's a top 3 Kendrick song.
KendrickLamar,3aisbu,joncabot,13,Sat Jun 20 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'mma be totally honest.  I was cool with the singing, I liked that. The rapping, not so much. I guess you/him don't really have the voice of a rapper? idk If I can say that, but it just didn't sound that good. It seemed like you/him had to force himself to keep ut with the flow and speed of the track. Maybe it's just this song that didn't fit the rapping, idk. But I liked the singing, I think that should be something to build on.  Anyways, I liked the video and subscribed, so I'll look out for some more. Don't want to seem harsh or anything, just giving my opinion.  (The beat was also nicely recreated)"
KendrickLamar,3aisbu,flackohowyoubeen,2,Sat Jun 20 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. Really loving the creativity and how everything fits together, but right now it almost feels too tight. Kendrick's flow tends to be relentless, but also emotionalâfeels like he's talking to you. Right now I get more of the relentless part, less of the emotion. It doesn't quite have the same conversational pace as the original version.   Otherwise, good job! Really liked what you did with the beat/hook."
KendrickLamar,3aisbu,splshcl,5,Sat Jun 20 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"The singing is good, but your rapping needs more...    Passion?"
KendrickLamar,3aisbu,GymothyCharles,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I loved the singing, but the rapping sounded like he was reading it for the first time."
KendrickLamar,3aisbu,xCaptainCookx,2,Sun Jun 21 05:29:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other comments. I think two things are throwing off your flow:   First: I don't hear the musical phrasing in your rapping. When you sing I can hear your smaller phrases and the overall, larger phrase. But when you rap I am not really sure where it is going. In other words, you are rapping to the end of the bar when you should rap to the end of the verse 2. Think about what rhythm the syllables are and how they relate. Kendrick often raps in perfect triplets which is difficult to pull off but gives a drive to his lines. He does it a lot in this track, specifically:  ""Fell on my face and awoke with a scar \ Another mistake living deep in my heart \ Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick \ I can admit that it did look like yours \ Why you resent every making of this \ Tell me your purpose is petty again \ But even a small lighter can burn a bridge \ Even a small lighter can burn a bridge""  Note that each line is either 10 or 11 syllables. 10 fits over 3 triplets and a quarter note for one bar, 11 fits if you use the first syllable as a pickup eighth note. I can hear that you are trying to do that but it's not straight and blended enough. Kendrick's monotone works wonders to blend that section. In the cover, you seem to want to place each word rather than each syllable. Working on that would make your flow less choppy. Especially placing the pickups and second syllable.  Other than that I do like the singing part. I wish more people would post about it instead of just downvoting it :(."

KendrickLamar,39v03c,joe_peters,14,Mon Jun 15 00:46:49 2015 UTC,Section 80 was his first full release with only TDE. GKMD is his first album with a big label.

J Cole is great. Forest Hills was great, I thought Born Sinner was really good (though most people don't), as well as The Sideline Story. His older mixtapes might be better than any of his studio albums, too.  I do think Kendrick is the better artist at this point, and his sound is way more serious and calculated than J Cole, if that makes any sense. I really hope they make that collaboration album, though, I think it would work really well."
KendrickLamar,38nk19,King_Elephant,6,Fri Jun 5 18:39:04 2015 UTC,J. Cole has somewhat of a conscious subject matter in some of his songs and he's a great storyteller. Very solid rapper and he seems to keep getting better with every album.   I wish he would do more guest verses on other people's songs. I loved his surprise verse on Surf.
KendrickLamar,38nk19,eklxtreme,3,Fri Jun 5 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"I see Kendrick as the prodigy kid who is just natural at it, and Cole being the guy that is not a natural but cares so much and tries so hard to be good that he gets to the same level as the gifted, even if he is just a regular guy.

KendrickLamar,38glpt,Waadapyo,9,Thu Jun 4 11:09:48 2015 UTC,I would want to know what his ultimate goal in the rap industry would be.
KendrickLamar,38glpt,SorryFortune,8,Thu Jun 4 02:40:36 2015 UTC,When is the J. Cole joint album coming out?
KendrickLamar,38glpt,TEHGOURDGOAT,2,Thu Jun 4 03:18:57 2015 UTC,It's not going to happen
KendrickLamar,38glpt,hipower805,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:10:05 2015 UTC,Why do you say that?
KendrickLamar,38glpt,joaaogui,3,Thu Jun 4 12:21:17 2015 UTC,I've been hearing about this since pre- maad city. It's detox at this point
KendrickLamar,38glpt,hipower805,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:08:13 2015 UTC,I heard he recently said he was going to do after they were done their solo projects and he is looking forward to doing the album with cole.
KendrickLamar,38glpt,TEHGOURDGOAT,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:36:30 2015 UTC,He's been saying the same thing since maad city
KendrickLamar,38glpt,hipower805,2,Thu Jun 4 20:48:00 2015 UTC,How do you feel being one of the best (if not the best) rappers of this generation and also being called a new tupac?  Did you see yourself become this big when you started as K Dot?  Do you still visit old friends in Compton (just visit not for a video) and what was their reaction when you became this big
KendrickLamar,38glpt,Headshot_,2,Thu Jun 4 13:21:02 2015 UTC,He's definitely still kickin it back in Compton with his old homies
KendrickLamar,38glpt,NoxK,4,Thu Jun 4 23:23:26 2015 UTC,How do you predict you'll be looked at and remembered in 20+ years?

KendrickLamar,38f5l8,redaws,4,Wed Jun 3 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"I've only just recently realized this was a song about a 17 year old prostitute who turned out the way she is because her father left her ""she gave it [money] all to her daddy, but she don't know her father"" and was raped by her mothers boyfriend at 10 years old.    Kendrick also says he played showed her this song at 11, but she became pregnant at 13.(mentions it on U)"
KendrickLamar,38f5l8,IpHobo,6,Wed Jun 3 20:27:47 2015 UTC,He said he played the song for his sister not the subject of the song.
KendrickLamar,38f5l8,ChepThree,2,Wed Jun 3 21:56:40 2015 UTC,I think he was saying he played the song for his sister and he mentions her getting pregnant in u
KendrickLamar,38f5l8,IpHobo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:40:43 2015 UTC,I maybe wrong but I think in u he's speaking as other people about himself.
KendrickLamar,38f5l8,IpHobo,2,Thu Jun 4 01:31:20 2015 UTC,Actually I looked it up you guys are right.
KendrickLamar,38f5l8,AllBoston,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:48:44 2015 UTC,You is him talking to himself and blaming himself for everything
KendrickLamar,38f5l8,Ais3,3,Sat Jun 27 21:02:38 2015 UTC,She also dies. Sing about me and U continues with this topic too.
KendrickLamar,38f5l8,kingkdot,5,Thu Jun 4 05:38:05 2015 UTC,"""She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper. Bumpin Brenda's got a baby while a pervert yelling at her"" such an insanely formed line that shows the irony in the story."
KendrickLamar,38d2hw,Headshot_,11,Wed Jun 3 12:56:43 2015 UTC,I think Alright is significantly more upbeat than U
KendrickLamar,38d2hw,109876ers,5,Wed Jun 3 15:51:46 2015 UTC,Oh crap.you're right
KendrickLamar,38d2hw,mowlio,3,Wed Jun 3 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"J Cole, Joey Badass, Earl Sweatshirt if you're looking for current stuff."
KendrickLamar,384bin,fort_wendy,9,Mon Jun 1 19:29:24 2015 UTC,It was only played once. Won't ever be heard again.
KendrickLamar,384bin,jackmanjoe15,11,Mon Jun 1 19:42:27 2015 UTC,Some say they're still playing it in the middle of a forest to this day.
KendrickLamar,384bin,109876ers,4,Mon Jun 1 19:50:59 2015 UTC,Made for his performance on the show I believe. A lot of it was improv too. Or at least short-notice
KendrickLamar,384bin,lysflatheaven,9,Mon Jun 1 20:07:07 2015 UTC,"Well that's impressive. I remember hearing/seeing it and telling myself ""I can't wait to hear the studio version of this.""  On the other hand, I like the live, album version of ""i"" more than the single version which was studio recorded. So was the album version a faux concert?"
KendrickLamar,384bin,HarryJohnstone,7,Mon Jun 1 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"yeah, that little exposÃ© at the end really transition nicely into mortal man"
KendrickLamar,384bin,ASovietSpy,5,Tue Jun 2 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"I prefer the single actually, it's a little more funky I find."
KendrickLamar,384i5w,coolniceawesome,11,Mon Jun 1 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"Either ""Wesley's Theory"" or ""Mortal Man"". They both summarise the title's message perfectly."
KendrickLamar,384i5w,ATadVillainy,8,Mon Jun 1 20:33:44 2015 UTC,"For sure, I think OP needs to listen to the album once more."
KendrickLamar,384i5w,TEHGOURDGOAT,2,Mon Jun 1 21:55:02 2015 UTC,Wesley's Theory
KendrickLamar,384i5w,Kenny__Loggins,9,Mon Jun 1 23:19:31 2015 UTC,How Much A Dollar Cost. Kendrick even said himself in an interview that it was going to be the original name of the album.
KendrickLamar,384i5w,E-T-,3,Tue Jun 2 10:45:49 2015 UTC,"On another note, i would totally be fine with TPAB called How Much A Dollar Cost...though it does sound abit off for an album name."
KendrickLamar,384i5w,lysflatheaven,3,Tue Jun 2 12:46:39 2015 UTC,"That, and it doesn't have a deeper meaning like TPAB. It fits, but it's a much more shallow, expositional title. Plus, the awesome spoken word we got at the end of Mortal Man would seem out of place if the album wasn't called TPAB. Just my thoughts"
KendrickLamar,384i5w,E-T-,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:33:46 2015 UTC,"I like TPAB, but I feel like How Much A Dollar Cost would be a better name because it represents Kendrick's struggles with fame and power."
KendrickLamar,384i5w,mathimeus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:54:27 2015 UTC,Any insight as to whether the name TPAB or the spoken word 2Pac interview part came first? As in which came from the other.
KendrickLamar,384i5w,Chajj,2,Mon Jun 8 01:54:26 2015 UTC,I thought he said one of the original names was going to be 2 Pimp A Caterpillar. I think that would be better just because of how it is abbreviated into.

KendrickLamar,37xeth,alabrasa301,2,Sun May 31 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"I think the reason he's not playing TPAB songs is because they're not easy listening. So festival goers who aren't necessarily there for kendrick just want bangers, so kendrick delivers. However if you went to a k dot concert u better believe that he'd be rockin some hood politics. Going to see kendrick at a festival In July really hoping for some section 80 as well as TPAB but probably gonna get a lot of gkmc but still pumped. Him and j Cole gonna be sick"
KendrickLamar,37xeth,gokovi27,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:26:30 2015 UTC,I feel like maybe he wants to give everyone some older material in anticipation for him doing a world tour where he plays the entire TPAB record from start to finish as a complete set
KendrickLamar,37xeth,gokovi27,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:49:58 2015 UTC,Kendrick is a smart guy and knows exactly what he's doing. Whatever he plays I'll be happy listening
KendrickLamar,37xeth,FleaSlapper,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:40:39 2015 UTC,Did he play Alright?
KendrickLamar,37xeth,FleaSlapper,1 point,Sun May 31 05:10:28 2015 UTC,Yes he did play Alright. It was tight.
KendrickLamar,37xeth,Truestor,1 point,Sun May 31 05:16:35 2015 UTC,I'm really surprised that Alright is the only song off TPAB being played live. I would've thought at least King Kunta and i would be in the set.
KendrickLamar,37xeth,Titangaming84,1 point,Sun May 31 05:37:18 2015 UTC,"I was also wondering why he only played alright from tpab. He played two sets from section 80, and the rest were from gkmc. Otherwise, awesome show, my ears are still ringing :)"

KendrickLamar,37ughr,Ollie1998,10,Sat May 30 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the guy singing?  That's Ashtrobot (He has a few different aliases), it's not a sample."
KendrickLamar,37ughr,ABadCharacter,2,Sat May 30 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean Ashtrobot, but is it like one of his own songs that I can listen to on its own or has he done it just for RRE?"
KendrickLamar,37ughr,ATadVillainy,4,Sat May 30 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"It's just on ""Ronald Reagan Era""."

KendrickLamar,37mz5p,Infemeth,2,Fri May 29 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"Hey sorry for the late response. First of all, thank you. Second, I own a few redbubble shirts myself and have found that the material fits really well and are the softest shirts I own. As for color or quality lose I haven't found this to be the case. I know that the preview they show on the website is as close to how it will be, as for really saturated images usually have color lose upon print, so they make the shirt preview pictures look slightly downgraded to match what it will be like, but something that's simple and clean cut like this should come out great I would imagine!"

KendrickLamar,37i2e4,tessalasset,1 point,Wed May 27 21:33:38 2015 UTC,But not as strong. He definetly tried going for that though
KendrickLamar,37i2e4,GrandmaFetish,1 point,Thu May 28 03:12:27 2015 UTC,For sure. It really brought that song to a whole other level tho.
KendrickLamar,37i2e4,tessalasset,2,Thu May 28 06:44:56 2015 UTC,I watched it right as it aired. :) It was like watching history in the making!
KendrickLamar,37i2e4,dan0314,2,Thu May 28 14:29:25 2015 UTC,Kendrick goes out and fucking kills it... on the Ellen show.
KendrickLamar,37i2e4,tmwyatt99,1 point,Sun May 31 20:18:06 2015 UTC,I thought the performance as a whole was amazing but after hearing the original so much this edited bersionfelt so weird
KendrickLamar,37i2e4,BostonSwashbuckler,1 point,Thu May 28 18:23:46 2015 UTC,"I was a little dissapointed that he used tracks instead of a band, and I also didn't really like the intensity at the end, it felt forced. On Colbert it totally worked, but it just didnt feel right with These Walls. Not a bad performance, but that Colbert performance really set the bar high, he really needs to tour with that band."
KendrickLamar,37i2e4,FleaSlapper,0,Thu May 28 21:33:46 2015 UTC,I lost it when he sang bilal's part  I'm sorry
KendrickLamar,37jc37,jayjiffy,3,Thu May 28 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"I'm going to bonnaroo in 2 weeks where Kdot is headlining, and the Sasquatch performance has me worried. I saw him at Roo in 2013, and the setlist is almost exact, besides ""Alright"" being added in.  Friends and I have been speculating, maybe his band doesn't know the songs? I can't imagine why he didn't play ""i"" though, he even has said in interviews that he wrote that song so he had to go out and play something happy and upbeat each night, and now he's not even playing it.  We'll see what Sweetlife and Summer Jam have to offer, combine that with These Walls on Ellen, and I hope there's more TPAB coming."
KendrickLamar,37jc37,Dubsox,1 point,Thu May 28 14:53:07 2015 UTC,I'm going to Roo as well and I really hope he brings a live band.
KendrickLamar,37jc37,scotch__mist,2,Fri May 29 06:09:11 2015 UTC,What song did he play from tpab?
KendrickLamar,37jc37,MrSaiyaman,1 point,Thu May 28 01:36:11 2015 UTC,"""Alright"", which I think is a great song, but not reaching the innovation of much of the rest of the album"
KendrickLamar,37jc37,ThePowerfulHamster,2,Thu May 28 02:32:09 2015 UTC,"Dude, 'Alright'  is a great track to play. Can you imagine if he had played u, or even How much a dollar cost? Some songs aren't suited for live play."
KendrickLamar,37jc37,matheusluiz,2,Thu May 28 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all saying its a bad song, and I agree that many songs on tpab are not nearly as well suited for a concert as much of his earlier stuff is, but I'm at a loss concerning how he couldn't make room for such songs as i, Blacker the Berry or King Kunta, when he had 10 unused minutes and spent a half hour on one song"
KendrickLamar,37jc37,hoardedsoviet,1 point,Thu May 28 19:59:38 2015 UTC,"No one's asking for him to play the whole album. These songs are not suited, but Blacker the Berry, i, These Walls, King Kunta and Hood Politics could all be easily placed on the setlist."
KendrickLamar,37jc37,SpiralFrac,2,Fri May 29 14:56:09 2015 UTC,"I think he is still young and trying to appease the masses. Its easier to play what you're more comfortable with and what other people and producers expect from you. When David Bowie started playing his more Alternative rock like  stuff from his Earthling or Heathen album People would boo, even though that's some of his best and most influential work. I think soon Kendrick will get more into the grove and develop as a performer.   Edit: Still weird that he didn't play blacker the berry or I"
KendrickLamar,37jc37,SpiralFrac,1 point,Thu May 28 14:09:04 2015 UTC,"I was there too, and had been wondering if he was going to play anything from tpab. I think one of the reasons was the make up of the audience. There were like 4 African Americans at sasquatch, and I think it would have been disingenuous for him to play most tracks from tpab when the point of the album was to point out and try to reconcile the disparity between whites and blacks in the US.   That said, I was disappointed he didn't play king kunta after ab-soul got me all hyped with the end of his show."
KendrickLamar,37f9em,FookinGumby,2,Wed May 27 04:57:58 2015 UTC,That's really cool. How did you make it?

KendrickLamar,37biep,sgkeef,13,Tue May 26 12:14:58 2015 UTC,I wish he would do a TPAB tour where he does the whole album but plays in indoor theaters only with a full band. That would match the album's vibe more than a stadium tour.
KendrickLamar,37biep,logicatch,8,Tue May 26 19:37:41 2015 UTC,"I would think King Kunta, Hood Politics, and Alright"
KendrickLamar,37biep,109876ers,10,Tue May 26 13:15:48 2015 UTC,And Wesley's Theory.   Wesley's Theory would be a great song to kick off the show
KendrickLamar,37biep,dan0314,8,Tue May 26 15:55:16 2015 UTC,Apparently he only used 80 minutes of his 90 minute set and did maad city 4 TIMES

KendrickLamar,37biep,eklxtreme,5,Tue May 26 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"Because GKMC is the more ""radioplay"" album. Kendrick's even said he was consciously shaping the sound of GKMC around what was popular and people wanted to hear. TPAB is what he wanted to play and hear."
KendrickLamar,37biep,maxkmiller,3,Wed May 27 04:09:26 2015 UTC,This is unsetting he better not do this at roo I'll be so let down!!
KendrickLamar,37biep,yosry8995,6,Tue May 26 20:12:36 2015 UTC,This would of been my worst nightmare. TPAB is one of my favourite albums ever but I skip 'alright' every time its on (unpopular opinion I know). What a strange choice.
KendrickLamar,37biep,vaudevilleviktor,7,Tue May 26 13:11:49 2015 UTC,It works so well right after u tho. It's like a roller coaster of emotion.

KendrickLamar,37biep,iSloshy,1 point,Tue May 26 22:23:32 2015 UTC,"ugh. I'm gonna go to Sweetlife Festival this weekend and I dropped a lot of money just to see Kendrick up front. I'm disappointed  that Kendrick will probably not be playing songs from what is my favorite hip hop album right now, but I'm still glad I'll be able to see him live at least... I was hoping I would catch a good live set from him though because I'm sure his upcoming world tour will cost $500 to be up close (I live in Boston)"

KendrickLamar,372tdk,OneLonerStoner,1 point,Mon May 25 00:32:34 2015 UTC,I don't really have time to discover new hip hop artists. I only listen to a couple of newer artists that I know I like. I'm more of a 90's guy so all these new acts sound too new to me.
KendrickLamar,372tdk,fort_wendy,2,Mon May 25 00:35:23 2015 UTC,"""New hip hop artists"" must mean new to you because Pusha T is nothing new. He's been in the game for over a decade now with his brother Malice as the Clipse. Who dropped their debut album, Lord Willin, in 2002. But I understand there's a lot of rappers out there to keep up with. As a 90s kid myself I can tell you Pusha T is better than most your favorite rappers."

KendrickLamar,36fgv9,Meowingtons-PhD,2,Tue May 19 18:22:12 2015 UTC,Me too and I've been doing this since 2007.
KendrickLamar,36f9jy,kingkoons,14,Mon May 18 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think if it was supposed to be on TPaB, then his verses would have been a lot better. These are his two weakest verses he's had in a long time. It felt like something thrown together to appeal to a wider audience."
KendrickLamar,36f9jy,Forever_Flaccid,2,Mon May 18 22:55:25 2015 UTC,Kendrick didn't use anything that would get censored either.
KendrickLamar,36f9jy,unseine,0,Tue May 19 10:01:55 2015 UTC,"exactly! thats why it didn't make the cut. it was a pop-y song with a big name feature. this would have no place in TPAB, but TPAB was said as having gone through changes, so this could have been a song kendrick left open as an option for a past concept. to me it seems weird that these guys are both (kinda) fresh off a studio release and then this loose single comes out. takes a long time to record and finalize major artists' tracks."
KendrickLamar,36f9jy,gayd3n,3,Mon May 18 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"thats why it didn't make the cut   Nah, I don't think this was the case. I think she just hit him up asking to do a song together but he's smart enough to know that he would have to have a more mainstream verse.  I highly, highly doubt this was ever meant for TPAB. He knew what he wanted to do with that album and this is absolutely the opposite of the style of it."
KendrickLamar,36f9jy,stealingyourpixels,13,Tue May 19 02:05:23 2015 UTC,Not a chance. The original Bad Blood is a song from Swift's album '1989'. This is just a remix featuring guest verses from Kendrick.
KendrickLamar,36f9jy,stealingyourpixels,6,Mon May 18 23:03:16 2015 UTC,ahhh shit okay. shoulda done research. it was just a fun thing to think about for me i guess. sorry to waste your time.

KendrickLamar,36f9jy,King_Kunta_,2,Mon May 18 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"No way this was meant for TPAB, man. No quality at all. I bet there's 20 songs that are fantastic that didnt make the cut"
KendrickLamar,36eg0t,hanothere,2,Mon May 18 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"It was overshadowed because it's the outro-thing to Marvin's Room, and at the time Kendrick wasn't that big yet. It's a great tune but it's literally just about Drake, and Take Care was also when Drake took blowing up to a whole knew level."
KendrickLamar,36eg0t,gayd3n,2,Tue May 19 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"Don't think it was literally just about Drake, I think Kendrick is actually talking about himself like it was that period when Kendrick had released Section 80 and was about to blow up :""I feel like a suicidal terrorist"". He is really using the image of Drake to express his desire of success. I feel like Buried Alive is not far from Wesley's Theory in terms thematic"
KendrickLamar,36bdo5,Onepieceop101,9,Mon May 18 00:24:29 2015 UTC,Just saw this before the Music Awards. :P Everytime I mention Kendrick is my favourite rapper my mom says he's awful :/

KendrickLamar,36bdo5,bertron1000,2,Mon May 18 15:16:39 2015 UTC,It was alright. Kendrick was pretty great and I like the little Backseat Freestyle reference but the video itself was just ok overall.

KendrickLamar,36bdo5,unseine,-5,Mon May 18 11:38:21 2015 UTC,I totally understood TPAB. I meant in terms of sound. I really enjoyed that album sonically and thematically.
KendrickLamar,36bdo5,scotch__mist,4,Mon May 18 18:40:06 2015 UTC,And you think these versus are so bad why?
KendrickLamar,36bdo5,unseine,-2,Mon May 18 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"His verses are the best part of the song. The song itself, and let me emphasize this, in MY opinion, is not good."
KendrickLamar,36bdo5,scotch__mist,3,Mon May 18 21:10:13 2015 UTC,Well what did you expect from a Taylor swift song? Its 100% what I expected.
KendrickLamar,36bdo5,unseine,3,Mon May 18 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"By no means is this Kendrick going mainstream or snatching new fan groups. I think it's pretty cool that Taylor and Kendrick are such good friends and fans of each other's work, this was just a small side project that Kendrick gladly accepted for his friend"
KendrickLamar,36bdo5,shnitzzy,0,Mon May 18 19:31:44 2015 UTC,You're right it is pretty cool. I just didn't really enjoy the song as a whole so much.

KendrickLamar,35cvx6,technopilgrim,12,Sat May 9 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"I think he's more talking about that this is what Michael Jackson's legacy has become; the paedophilia scandal. When speaking of him now this is the first thing that you think about, rather than his musical genius and the extremely influential role he had in popularising black entertainers.  I believe MJ was innocent, and it seems Kendrick does too. He was never found guilty of any crime, and in the eyes of the law you are innocent until proven guilty, so I don't think it's wrong for Kendrick to imply that he is innocent, as we should all believe this is so until he is found guilty of anything.   He was definitely mentally unstable, from what I've read he seemed to believe he was still a child. I believe he shared a bed with some kids but I really doubt anything sexual happened, he probably just thought of it as a slumber party.  Of course no one could ever know except MJ and the kids he was with, this is just me speculating.  This is what genius.com says about the 3rd chorus:   ""Controversy from a A-list celebrity leads to a heavy panning to said celebrity. Most notably, the âKing of Popâ Michael Jackson faced numerous accusations of child sex abuse. This permanently tarred his reputation, even though he was later acquitted.  Kendrick is criticizing moral absolutism â the belief that people are wholly virtuous or wholly wicked based on a certain deed or group of deeds. For example, some point out that MLK was unfaithful to his wife and therefore should not be praised as the morally correct leader that many believe him to be.  Similarly, Kendrick does not want people to write off Michael Jackson as a mere child molester, even if he in fact was one. Because if the allegations that âhe touched those kidsâ are true, they still donât take away from the fact that Jackson was a revolutionary artist who touched the lives of millions and influenced a generation of musicians.  This line reflects a broader theme pervading the track and indeed the album as a whole: the need for forgiveness. As âMortal Menâ, all of us are in need of forgiveness; all of us are all sinners, from Kendrick to Michael Jackson to the pope himself. Yet in a world full of sinners, we must find the ability to empathize, identify, and share our common flaws if we are to find peace. And as Kendrick goes on to explain in the outro, all of this begins with forgiveness. We must forget âall the pain and the hurt we caused each otherâ and embrace love over hate, love over pride, love over everything. Only then can we find it possible to forgive ourselves and others.""    http://genius.com/5047475       sampence, BRK_ES_717, Vesuvius, TwistedMental, BMS contributed to that analysis."
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,punter75,1 point,Sat May 9 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"While I entirely agree with the adage of 'innocent until proven guilty', I still don't think basing his judgement on MJ because of his musical ability is right. And to clarify, I am not saying that he did touch any children.   This annotation on Genius got 86 upvotes,   Heâs brought up the fact that MJ gave us Billie Jean and then questioned whether given this evidence you really think âhe touched those kidsâ? Heâs basically implied that MJ was far too amazing to have been a child molester and that it was a media fabrication to bring down an African-American icon just like the others in this song. K.dotâs implied that no one who can create something so amazing could also do something so horrible and that we were duped.   I think this is a very naive attitude to hold. People can be amazingly creative and talented, and still do bad things. Its just something which spoils my enjoyment of the song ever so slightly."
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,punter75,1 point,Sat May 9 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"That's not the way I interpret it. It doesn't seem to me like he's saying he couldn't have done it because of Billie Jean, it's more that the sentence flows and is the right amount of syllables and Kendrick is limited by the beat and his previous lines. It feels like that comma in the middle of the sentence separates the two ideas. But this is just my interpretation I'm not saying yours is wrong or mine is correct."
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,Astrapsody,3,Sun May 10 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"Out of the context of the song, the line doesn't really make sense, like you said, but at that point in the song he's communicating his frustration with people that abandon leaders and icons when they need people most.   So to me, the line doesn't necessarily imply that any claims of wrongdoing are nullified if you're a leader/icon, but that people should give you the benefit of the doubt until you are proven guilty.    If Iâm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off  If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car  Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar  Or question my character and degrade me on every blog   This is a super important line in the song.   Plant cocaine in my car, would you judge me a drug head?   Not caught with cocaine in my car, would you judge me a drug head?"

We labeled a man who the justice system did not find to be guilty as a criminal, and wouldn't let him escape it. Kendrick's cry is dialed to 11 by this point. He's just giving another example of how we destroy those we admire."
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,taijituii,2,Sat May 9 13:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying MJ is guilty at all, just thought it was strange for Kendrick to plea his innocence because he was a famous black musician.

KendrickLamar,35cvx6,KOO_DADDIE,1 point,Sat May 9 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"I can see that point. It is odd to use his musical success as a point of emphasis. I think what he meant by that was that he constantly gave to us, why would he just turn and hurt us. Still, it is a bit odd."
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,punter75,1 point,Sat May 9 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it, Kendrick isn't questioning why people would think MJ touched those kids. Instead, K-dot is showing that we let rumors that have not been proven deceive our perception of one of the greatest artists of all time. ""When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?"" If this same type of thing were to happen to Kendrick, would you still be a fan? That's how I see it."
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,antesjosh,2,Sat May 9 22:16:10 2015 UTC,I think you're spot on with that correlation. Never linked the two myself.
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,kentuckyfriedpete_za,1 point,Sun May 10 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"He's definitely alluding to the fact that when the going gets tough, you find your real friends. When MJ was on trial, many people thought that he was guilty, and some of them were his biggest fans. These people left him when he needed them most, as some have said."
KendrickLamar,35cvx6,Propolandante,1 point,Mon May 11 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way as you but I started looking at it under the "" shit hits the fan are you still a fan"" perspective. It's irrelevant whether kendrick thinks or doesn't think MJ touched kids. It's the idea that if people SAY he touched kids,, are you gonna be a true friend and fan and stick around by his side,, or just believe the rumors without forming your own opinion on the matter. It goes along with the lines about the government framing kendrick by putting cocain in his car. Even though he didn't actually have cocain in this hypothetical scenario, would you still be a fan and give him. The benefit of the doubt once shit hits the fan?   Imho"
KendrickLamar,35ch8p,claytondufresne,3,Fri May 8 23:55:48 2015 UTC,"This is a weird article. It is equating resistance with the power of the artist, which doesn't seem like a reasonable point at all to make.  Kendricks work is beautiful. As is Tupacs. But to compare the resistance to their work as some sort of validity test is silly, especially when starting the article with a shout out to Kanye. Is the author saying Kanye is a stronger writer and artist than Kendrick because more people dislike him? Because that is about the comparison that he is making between Kendrick and Tupac."
KendrickLamar,35ch8p,MediocreMatt,5,Sat May 9 01:13:42 2015 UTC,"To me, I think Kendrick is a revolutionary, or at least he will be. TPaB was a great way for him to say ""I'm famous now, and I've had to grapple with my new life, but I'm ready to make the world better"". I think it's a record about personal demons and self loathing that ends with Kendrick embracing his new fame and acknowledging that he needs to use it to change the world. If he hasn't become a revolutionary yet, I'm certain he will in the near future."
KendrickLamar,35ch8p,tightastic,2,Sat May 9 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"No, no, no, no, no. Kendrick is anything, but, ""beautiful vagueness."" Kendrick Lamar is not Tupac, that much is clear. However, he is revolutionary. Kendrick Lamar is revolutionary in a way that no other rapper has even attempted, aside from a select few bars from J. Cole, Ab-Soul, and Macklemore: Kendrick Lamar has called for love. Not just any kind of love; universal, unconditional love. He's asked us all to let it all go; let the past and future go to live in the present. Live and love. He's forsaken the worn-out roads of rebellion, and conventional revolution, and come up with his own answers to the world (another consistent theme of his throughout his entire discography). Is this idealistic? Yes. Revolutionary? Yes."
KendrickLamar,35ch8p,taijituii,1 point,Sat May 9 13:19:23 2015 UTC,"After re-listening to the Pac interview, I agree with your analysis the most.   Pac talks about a rising up of the poor to ""eat"" the rich, and he was pretty explicit in what he meant by that when he said words like ""bloodshed,"" ""murder,"" and ""Nat Turner."" Kendrick is in agreement for the most part, but then he reads the butterfly metaphor/story that his friend wrote, which is basically a metaphor for ""change comes from within"" and Kendrick's way of saying that maybe violence isn't the answer. So, instead of the route Tupac was alluding to, Kendrick asks Pac what he thinks about the struggle of changing from within in order to make the most impact on racial issues and the plethora of other issues that plague the lower socioeconomic class of America. And then, of course, there's no response from Pac which forces the listener to think and form their own opinion."
KendrickLamar,35ch8p,taijituii,1 point,Sat May 9 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"I think that another interpretation of Pac's absence of a response, is that his absence of a response is the ultimate response. It's sole purpose is to illustrate the theme and maybe even indicate the turning point in Kendrick's ideals. The war that Pac and so many other rappers desperately begged for, and the general was the first casualty; the cycle continues. Rather than becoming the next casualty, the aforementioned rappers have created an army with a new set of tactics, a new ideology; one never seen before. This new army refuses to fight, and, in doing so, fights more effectively than any previous force. They challenge the incipient ideologies of these intrinsically flawed institutions, effectively ""defeating"" their enemies. To take from the outro of J. Cole's Fire Squad they've taken the crown. However, rather than attempting adorn themselves with it, they destroy it. No more kings."
KendrickLamar,359bgk,cichington,5,Fri May 8 04:38:30 2015 UTC,Im sure he will revisit his old work. I have seen many hip-hop acts including Kendrick a couple times and none of them have ever exclusively performed songs from a single album.  Each time I have seen Kendrick he has performed songs from Kendrick EP to O.D. to S80 to GKMC to random features.

KendrickLamar,359bgk,TheSepulverizer,3,Fri May 8 07:33:41 2015 UTC,"Now that is a resolution I would want to keep. You definitely need to go, he has so much energy live.  I have seen him 3 times, the first two times he had nothing but a dj and turntables and it was a pretty good show.But when kendrick has a live band behind him it is an entirely different animal, so much more energy. It gave me a whole new appreciation for songs I already loved like Sing About Me and Money Trees... It was an unforgettable experience.  I assume he will have a live band behind him, TPAB will sound great if so.   Also, cartoons and cereal live is the shit"

Parts of Goldlink's The God Complex, Mick Jenkins' The Waters and Vic Mensa's Innanetape come to mind. For something more mainstream try Joey Bada$$ or Lupe Fiasco.

KendrickLamar,34meux,hanothere,5,Sat May 2 23:44:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can completely agree with you. I tried and tried and tried to get into it and i really can't. I will pick another album to listen to everytime i sit down at the moment - I've given up on trying to force myself into it for the meantime. I'm not sure if it was a combination of being so hyped for the album to be GKMC 2.0 and it to come out very ""interlude-y"" as you mentioned was pretty disappointing.  That being said, was out last night and overheard it playing in the taco joint and loved listening to it then so perhaps its growing on me?"
KendrickLamar,34meux,Headshot_,3,Sun May 3 08:37:11 2015 UTC,"I hope it will though personally I think what you call ""interlude-y"" gives the album an other dimension"
KendrickLamar,34meux,maxkmiller,4,Sun May 3 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"I hated TPAB when I first heard it. Dissapointed. Listened again after a week, terrible. Gave another bit too it and listened to it more, now its my all time favorite album."
KendrickLamar,34meux,fort_wendy,4,Mon May 4 14:05:26 2015 UTC,Didn't like it at first but now I can't stop replaying it.  It should grow on you because it's different from gkmc
KendrickLamar,34meux,Kenny__Loggins,7,Thu May 7 03:25:21 2015 UTC,"Goddamn. BTI is not experimental. I don't know why people keep saying that. BTI has many elements of mainstream hiphop in it, much more than Gambino's previous album's (especially Camp, for example, which is muuuuch more experimental in its use of actual instruments than anything else Gambino has done). Songs like 3005, Crawl, Sweatpants, The Worst Guys, Pink Toes all have pretty big mainstream and pop influences. ""Radioplay"" songs. Don't get me wrong, these songs are all great, but distinctly sounded like he was trying to gain a more broad audience base compared to the sound of Camp. But this is a Kendrick question, so I digress...  TPAB has a diverse sound. To say you don't like the whole album is a pretty big statement. If you're into soulful, funky songs look for tracks like These Walls, i, Complexion,  and You Ain't Gotta Lie. If you're looking for a banger, listen to something like Alright. Admittedly, I'm not that into some of the more ""popular"" tracks on the album like Blacker the Berry or U or sometimes Institutionalized. King Kunta has grown on me.   If you're like me, tell your iTunes to cut out a lot of the intro/interlude stuff you dgaf about, I fucking hate the intro to These Walls, it's obnoxious as fuck, so I got rid of it. Same goes for i.   One listen does it no justice."
KendrickLamar,34meux,Kenny__Loggins,3,Sat May 2 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"well i love camp aswell, maybe even more, and whilst there are many mainstream songs on BTI, it is also full of interludes and soundbits. I guess what i was trying to say is I dont find them annoying normaly.  Ill give TPAB another listen proably, but it feels like it is something you have do fully without doing something else, so ill see"
KendrickLamar,34meux,adamsandleryabish,4,Sat May 2 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"Yes you shouldn't be doing something else. It's more of a storytelling session when listening to kdot's albums. You have to be fully immersed, like he's there talking to you.   Or maybe you just don't like TPAB. To each his own."
KendrickLamar,34meux,hipower805,3,Sat May 2 23:28:16 2015 UTC,It always amazes me that nobody ever mentions Wesley's Theory when talking about this album. One of my favorites.
KendrickLamar,34meux,GymothyCharles,3,Sat May 2 21:04:37 2015 UTC,Judging an album on the first listen is always a bad idea. I didn't care for TPAB at all first listen.  It isn't an easily digestible album. It's not a collection of bangers.   It's an experience. It might take 3 or 4 listens to even begin to understand some of what's happening on the album.

KendrickLamar,34a3l6,An_Insane_Stork,7,Wed Apr 29 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"While it is my favorite thing Snoop has done in forever (sounded like classic snoop), this is personally my least favorite track on the album for me. Lyrically every song is legendary, so I do love this track. Just harder on the ear than all the others. This one and How Much A Dollar Cost are almost too much straight rap, if there is such a thing. They dont connect as well as like a musically sick track like These Walls or Hood Politics  Maybe a product of a mild hook that some might call boring compared to others (Shit dont change until ya get up and wash yo ass, nigga)  But its always worth a listen for Kendricks cool flow and of course the snoop bridges"

I love that organ keyboard or whatever it is that's playing, and how casually it leads into the next segment. Plus, the way the ""zoom-zoom-zoom"" part goes from headphone to headphone is pure production genius. Great track."

KendrickLamar,348jmu,Twisted_Lobster,7,Wed Apr 29 03:35:43 2015 UTC,it's nearly impossible to choose a best song on the album but wesley's theory is definitely up there for me
KendrickLamar,348jmu,tgross25,7,Wed Apr 29 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"My favorite is For Sale?  I don't know why, and I'm not sure if this is what he intended or not, but I love to think of the sequences of the interlude like this.   ""For Free?"" is a song about Lucifier trying to take Kendrick's soul for free. Through pressure of a woman, he wants to just snatch his soul away from him. However, after this song, he realizes that Kendrick isn't as easy to nab as other rappers or celebrities in general. ""For Sale?"" is a follow-up, trying to get Kendrick to sell him his soul. The next one explains all of the different ways the Devil will work for him.   Lucy gone fill your pockets  Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton  Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised  Lucy just want your trust and loyalty  Avoiding me?  It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly  Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute  Lucy work harder  Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father  I'm Lucy    The Devil is now trying harder to claim his soul through a false illusion of trade, or the illusion that Kendrick will get something in return. I feel like the Lucifier succeeded, and the effects of this are seen in U. The rest of the album is his climb out of the grasp of the Devil. I know that's not in order, but it's still significant to me.  I don't know, that's just my opinion."
KendrickLamar,348jmu,tmwyatt99,5,Thu Apr 30 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"For me, it's:  U  These Walls  And then probably Wesley's Theory in 3rd place, maybe Momma though.   But Wesley's Theory is dope"
KendrickLamar,348jmu,109876ers,5,Wed Apr 29 11:29:34 2015 UTC,Top 3 for me are Wesleys Theory U Hood Politics
KendrickLamar,348jmu,GymothyCharles,3,Mon May 4 07:00:16 2015 UTC,Wesley's theory is amazing.   I can't not replay the hit me! Part when I play it.   Tune is amazing too

KendrickLamar,348jmu,kingkdot,1 point,Fri May 1 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"sonically it is the best, like it's amazing how it flows and sounds like an OpÃ©ras with that little sample at the beginning (which is my ringtone BTW). Ali one of Kendrick producers said he had literally spent 6 DAYS mixing the song the result is amazing, it's so fresh (not like today meaning of fresh but really some cool breeze). The message of the song is also amazing. It is definitely the best way to start the album.  Somehow lyrically there are better songs in the album though."

KendrickLamar,34813c,BluKIT8,6,Wed Apr 29 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the line ""Two niggas, two black hoodies I froze as my phone rang"" comes at the end of the song Sherane, after Kendrick and Sherane have already ""chirped the whole summer,"" referring to the distinct ringtone of Nextel phones. So when he visits her house, it's following several months of talking. Additionally, the two in front of her house may not be there to beat him up necessarily, only to signify that Sherane is involved with the gang life that Kendrick comes to despise.   The other comment touched on this, but Sherane is tied with Poetic Justice, in that Poetic Justice is also set on his way to Sherane's house as well, albeit perhaps on a different occasion. In this instance, he is interrogated by the men near her house, as captured in the skit at the end of Poetic Justice. Their words are also the ones echoed in the hook of m.a.a.d city (""Where you from, nigga? Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?..."")    Also, you might be interested in the rap genius blurbs for each song:    Sherane (a.k.a. Master Splinter's Daughter):   The story opens as a flash-forward. K.Dot has known Sherane for a number of months by this point. He met her at a party where they flirted and exchanged numbers. They kept in contact with each other over the summer and got to know each other pretty well. He also talks about her familyâs history of gang-banging that made him wary but didnât stop him from hooking up with her. At the end of this song K.Dot is driving to Sheraneâs house in his Motherâs van, he has sex on the brain. But when he turns up Sherane is outside waiting with two dudes in black hoodies (possibly her two younger brothers, or her cousins, one of which could be Demetrius).     Poetic Justice:     K.Dot has been dropped off back at home by his homies and is about to go see Sherane. Heâs probably driving on the way there in his Motherâs van. He talks about her and their relationship so far â it appears they may have had some arguments, he talks about her meeting up with her girlfriends to curse him, and going out partying rather than talking with him."
KendrickLamar,34813c,salingersouth,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:32:18 2015 UTC,"I see your point but I think he goes a step further and explains what happens to him in good kid, because he talks getting hassled and beat up by gang members.

KendrickLamar,34813c,StepOsets,2,Thu May 7 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"At the end of poetic justice, the intro for sherane plays afterwards. someone had mentioned a line comparing it to pulp fiction and how events like pulp fiction are told out of order.

KendrickLamar,34813c,taijituii,2,Thu Apr 30 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah! And he explains what happened to him a bit in good kid, I think. I think that you're right, he gets beat up then his friends find him and bring him liquor to kill the pain"

I'm pretty new to the genre and only really necame turned on to it since Yeezus. As an English white male some of the references in both albums went totally above me, so i was forced to check them out. The ""forty acres and a mule"" line went above my head until i read up on it and adds yet another layer to it.   The same for ""i got a bone to pick"" in King Kunta. With Kunta Kinte chosing to lose a limb rather than be castrated. Picking at the bone, picking a 'bone', as well as its more common meaning. Thats what i've read/got from it anyway.  Its a fucking phenominal album and i feel lucky i can experience it at the time its relevant, rather than listening to records of the past and wondering what it would be like to be listening to it at the time of release"

However last week he cancelled his July 2nd show leaving me in despair :(   I wish the best to you and I hope that this doesn't happen to you :/"
KendrickLamar,33izsd,shnitzzy,3,Wed Apr 22 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"Brutal. It just seems odd that there'd be so many events booked for the 1st - 4th. What I'm worried about is whether this could just be a stunt pulled by Roskilde Festival to attract more people. The fact that I can't really find an exact date also makes it very annoying, since I'm not planning on buying a ticket for the entire festival."
KendrickLamar,33izsd,shnitzzy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"I was in the same shoes as you.. The concert didn't show up on his tour either. I can't really complain though I still have an awesome line up, except for my favorite artist. Sucks a lot but I really hope he/his management team doesn't pull a stunt like they did to me and his Polish fan base to you. I doubt it's a publicity stunt though, probably just poor booking in my case (but if he does show up to your Denmark show he'll kindddaa be blowing us off). Ehh can't fault him though he's not super big in Poland. Anyways hoping he'll be there for you guys, I'm curious to see what'll happen"
KendrickLamar,33izsd,Siborg_Seadog,3,Wed Apr 22 22:57:47 2015 UTC,Sounds a bit like the festival just listed him to get people to buy tickets and then just said he cancelled... But then I don't no much about the kind of regulations on festivals doing this or whether this sort of things actually happens
KendrickLamar,33izsd,shnitzzy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"It's possible of course, but I kind of doubt it. The festival is getting a lot of big names like Mumford & Sons and Hozier that pretty much everyone can enjoy. Kendrick isn't anywhere as big as he is in the U.S. and UK and other European countries, so it's entirely possible that he just got a better show where he knows there will be a bigger fan base, and I completely respect and understand that. Really sucks for his loyal fans like me, but what can you do."
KendrickLamar,33izsd,Siborg_Seadog,3,Thu Apr 23 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"Well I hope you get see him at some point soon, would be a shame to miss out."

KendrickLamar,33e359,Chroll0,14,Tue Apr 21 19:51:31 2015 UTC,K dot already explained what it means though.
KendrickLamar,33e359,unseine,3,Tue Apr 21 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"The caterpillar is anyone coming out of the hood, G.K.M.C was about Kendrick being a caterpillar and entering the cocoon. Then TPAB is him transformed as a butterfly."
KendrickLamar,33e359,kingkdot,5,Tue Apr 21 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"The thing with interpretations, there is no right or wrong answer. I don't think even Kendrick knows the right answer. He stated in an interview that he didn't even realize that if you changed butterfly to caterpillar that it would come out to be ToPAC (2Pac). Someone put him on that after the fact. He also said the title wasn't inspired by To Kill a Mockingbird either. So it really just leaves the listener to choose their own interpretation of the title."
KendrickLamar,33e359,mr_jiffy,2,Tue Apr 21 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, in that Pac can be interpreted as a caterpillar. Pac, although he was a more enlightened guy, never got out of the hood mentality. His ways eventually led to his murder. I've always thought it was weird when people look up to Pac as a role model - he really wasn't as great as people crack him up to be. His raps were 80% murdering people, robbing, etc. You don't feel uplifted listening to his music and it doesn't inspire you to do greater things. Of course, there are some Pac songs that are compelling in this way, but these are the exception to the rule. For every Dear Mama, there's 5 of Hit Em Up.   Disclaimer: I fucking love Pac. I'm just saying that despite being considered a ""more enlightened"" figure in rap, his raps were primarily of hedonistic nature and only occasionally rose to altruistic heights. So I can easily see how Kendrick might in a way consider himself a butterfly to Pac's caterpillar."

Here is the torrent page, and I also uploaded it on MEGA if you can't do torrents or you can't access kickass. I was looking for one too, as some tracks like Ignorance is Bliss was quite bad quality. I don't know if there is breaking the rules, but they don't say anything about this, and this is a free mixtape... anyway enjoy!"
KendrickLamar,32rbvx,mikedon11,6,Thu Apr 16 02:16:03 2015 UTC,Actually technically Kendrick wrote his verse before Kanye because he helped Kanye in the making and Ye took a few parts out of Kendricks verse. So it shouldn't be a remix ðð
KendrickLamar,32rbvx,good_kid_madd_city,2,Thu Apr 16 16:17:17 2015 UTC,His verse starts around 1:40
KendrickLamar,32mha5,Onepieceop101,16,Tue Apr 14 23:43:58 2015 UTC,My personal favorite Kendrick song. It's way too catchy. I also love how throwback it is to funk groups like the sugar hill gang and such.
KendrickLamar,32mha5,not-a-celebrity,11,Wed Apr 15 04:31:50 2015 UTC,Dude... This song has such a good vibe. I really just can't explain why I like it so much...

KendrickLamar,32mha5,dksk3443,2,Sun May 10 18:15:16 2015 UTC,"All right. I dig the song, but I prefer some of the more 'grittier' songs off this album (see: How much a dollar cost) I agree with u/not-a-celebrity that it is a catchy song, but I suppose that it's a good way to entice others to pick up the album. In conclusion, I feel that Kendrick sends a more powerful message when the skies are grey."
KendrickLamar,32mha5,dksk3443,2,Wed Apr 15 17:25:48 2015 UTC,This song took the most replays to fully appreciate for me.
KendrickLamar,32mha5,Headshot_,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:42:03 2015 UTC,"I love this song, its probably my favorite off the album. I love the funk and soul elements of the song and the all around good vibes."

KendrickLamar,32mha5,JKirbyy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:23:21 2015 UTC,It was my favorite song until I heard the rest of the album  I still love the song. Its catchy.
KendrickLamar,32mha5,unseine,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"What makes it amazing is if you look into the story of 'Kunta Kinte', a lot of it resembles themes and topics of the songs. For example Kunta Kinte chose getting his legs cut off over castration. This links with the line in the hook and also the ideas suggested in the song about being a proud man no matter what. For example ""And if I gotta brown nose for some gold..."""
KendrickLamar,32mha5,JKirbyy,6,Wed Apr 15 19:53:18 2015 UTC,A proud black man.   FTFY. Don't whitewash Kendrick's music
KendrickLamar,32mha5,Tomoromo9,0,Wed Apr 15 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the castration,  having a dick doesn't mean you are black. Yes he speaks a lot on being a proud black man but that is irrelevant to my point..."

KendrickLamar,32e8ju,dZ197,2,Sun Apr 26 13:02:23 2015 UTC,That's the bootleg that's up for sale on places like vinyl-digital. I wanna wait for an official one because I hate how the packaging looks on that but at this rate I might have to get that.
KendrickLamar,32e8ju,dZ197,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:56:27 2015 UTC,Looks like its sold out. I got it from hhv.de and they have a next preorder set up for 22.05. There is even the tracklist messed up comparing to the digital release and some skits got cut off
KendrickLamar,32e8ju,sig1922,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:19:28 2015 UTC,"How are the skits changed? It really seems like the people putting that release together didn't care for the music whatsoever, changing the tracklist and cutting skits ruins the flow of the album."
KendrickLamar,32e8ju,CamTDE92,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:33:29 2015 UTC,"check the tracklist on discogs, I am not home right now, but I remember that at the end of one side the skit is just cut off, and yes u r right, the whole concept of the album is well built and this ruins it definitely, but I am really happy to have a limited bootleg ;) you really think there will be an official pressing, I don't think there is much demand for mainstream rap vinyls"

KendrickLamar,32dplm,adamsandleryabish,4,Sun Apr 12 23:02:08 2015 UTC,"Waiting for TPAB, I was excited, but also worried about the pressure and if the album would live up. This time I feel different. No fear at all. I can't wait to hear the next classic. It has to be one.   (Although I thought the same thing after The Eminem Show was Em's 3rd straight classic, and look how much Encore failed in comparison.)"
KendrickLamar,32dplm,109876ers,2,Mon Apr 13 01:45:58 2015 UTC,"That's the difference between rappers and rap artists. Eminem is a rapper through and through. He can rap his ass off but I don't think he can tell a story that well. Kendrick paints pictures with his words. With that being said, I don't expect Kendrick to put out a bunch of random garbage."
KendrickLamar,32dplm,mr_jiffy,3,Wed Apr 15 00:40:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think comparing anyone to Kendrick in terms of story telling is fair at all. Em may not be Kendrick, but Em is also one of the best story tellers of all time in his own way, even if he fails in comparison to Kendrick (everyone does)"
KendrickLamar,32dplm,109876ers,8,Wed Apr 15 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"I think Kendrick will cut the jazz and just have a bunch of raw beats where he goes in on every track just fired up, there will definitely somehow be a story about kendrick though."
KendrickLamar,32dplm,kingkdot,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"eh, I don't really want that out of Kendrick to be honest. His experimenting is an awesome thing for the jazz community and is dope as hell. He could just go on a bunch of beats and kill them but where's the longevity in that? Hell that doesn't even sound fun for Kendrick because he wouldn't be trying his hardest. I think he should start to get into producing his own music entirely."

KendrickLamar,32dplm,Hi_Im_Small_Text_Bot,4,Wed Apr 15 03:17:52 2015 UTC,"Kendrick's cares more about changing his community than he does himself. If not, then he is damn good at making it seem that way. Both GKMC and TPAB had a similar purpose: to change the way a gang-influenced adolescent thinks and show whats really important (God, Family, a career instead of pride, money, gang-life). He has executed this so brilliantly, each album in a different way.  There's two different ways I can see the next album going. First, taking J. Cole route and talking about staying true to your self and not giving into the pressures of the music industry just to stay alive. Listen to Rich Niggaz if you haven't already. Second, I would like to see a feature album. An album with songs featuring young rappers in the Compton area. This would be physical evidence of Kendrick helping these young artist out of the hood so that they can follow in his footsteps. It would have a ""Jesus and his apostles"" feel. Shit, may as well make it a 12 track album. It would be very difficult to do right without it being cheesy. It would also be difficult to recruit the right artists, but if done correctly it would be a powerful way of allowing these artists to have a voice even if only for 1 verse. If anyone can do it, Kendrick can."
KendrickLamar,32dplm,kmccun2,3,Wed Apr 15 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like he's going to end up regressing into a more traditional style...or possibly go even further out there.  Maybe do something noisy.  But he seems to be going into a more and more jazzier, soulful sound, so who knows.  He's already released three amazing albums (Section.80, GKMC, TPAB), so...honestly, I will be really, really surprised if he does a fourth one that matches up.  Like, TPAB is so awesome for me, I wouldn't be surprised if the fourth album is just mediocre, if anything, I'd be completely okay with that."
KendrickLamar,32dplm,giantpandasonfire,2,Mon Apr 13 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like he's going to go even more controversial and more conscious. He used GKMC to catch the public's attention, then he did something he liked and the next time he's going to do something to just fuck up the game. I think he's the kind of person not content with something you'd expect. Now that we expect him to do something out of the park, he's going to make something out of this world. I'm hoping."
KendrickLamar,32dplm,mr_jiffy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:45:06 2015 UTC,I was thinking about that too. I always think he's not gonna top the last one and he does it anyway so I'm huped for whatever he puts out next.

KendrickLamar,322ryh,creepy_hawaiian,4,Sat Apr 11 23:29:35 2015 UTC,"The album itself was not a disappointment to me. I love it, I can't stop listening to it. What was more disappointing to me was that it wasn't what I expected (I expected more of a GKMC feel). However, once I thought about it and listened to TPAB as its own album, I was no longer disappointed."
KendrickLamar,322ryh,divine3fury,7,Fri Apr 10 07:29:01 2015 UTC,No it was not disappointing at all. With GKMC Kendrick found a good medium between mainstream but still keeping his sound. I loved GKMC but I wondered and hoped he would go back to his section 80 sound with the more instremuntal beats. It's a hard album to swallow if GKMC was the first you heard of Kendrick but I honestly think its better...just my opinion tho
KendrickLamar,322ryh,Ozneroe,4,Fri Apr 10 03:19:30 2015 UTC,"The album is a masterpiece, it's even better than GKMC IMO. It's not like GKMC was easy to get into either. Yes GKMC has more singles, musically however this album is alot better, it's got like 6 Money Trees on it"

KendrickLamar,322ryh,sulmagnificent,4,Sun Apr 12 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"I mean it's just my opinion, please don't berate me for it. I understand if you disagree it's normal music is subjective, the supposed six Money Trees are: U, Momma, Hood Politics, How Much A Dollar Costs, These Walls and Institutionalized. I only compare them to Money Trees because of how they make me reflect on life, morality, and how modern society pushes people to lead a materialistic lifestyle. Musically the beats and samples are just really tight and more spontaneous than in GKMC. I don't know how else to explain it, maybe musically this album simply has a greater appeal to my ears than it does to yours. Hope I don't come of as preachy here..."
KendrickLamar,322ryh,owlsrule143,-1,Sun Apr 12 07:48:48 2015 UTC,"there isn't even a tune to hood politics.. and u is an emotional song, the music follows the pain of the lyrics but how in the fuck is it a ""money trees"" type song? not even close. How Much a Dollar Cost I really enjoy, the beats are unique as fuck and really cool, but I would say that King Kunta is the only one comparable to money trees in terms of instant appeal and fun, and being memorable."
KendrickLamar,322ryh,OrangeScarface,-7,Mon Apr 20 07:44:16 2015 UTC,LOL no.
KendrickLamar,322ryh,owlsrule143,6,Sat Apr 11 21:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was. Based on what I've gathered on reading from the internet and some of my friends opinions, people were expecting some album full of bangers.   They went in with this mindset before the album started and on the first song their reactions were already ""WTF is this, this ain't no real Kendrick."" If people stay with that mindset throughout the whole album of course they aren't going to like it with the attitude. I watch interviews, especially Kendrick's and he always mentions to not expect anything from the album.   That being said, I could totally see why it doesn't appeal to everybody. I wasn't a fan of jazzy type music until this album came out. I prefer TPAB over GKMC as a album overall but both albums are still incredible on their own."
KendrickLamar,322ryh,gdkbitch,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"i hate this mentality. I expected bangers sure but that doesn't excuse the generally lower calibre of music and songwriting. once i got over how different and disappointing it was in terms of song style, I realized the album really was just not as good. and please for the love of god stop saying that this is the first jazzy and funky album kendrick has done, so therefore people who don't like the album are just closed minded to jazz and funk.  GKMC was full of jazz and funk, and Section.80 even more so, but those were both fantastically written and produced albums with catchy songs and raps, and big choruses and generally just memorable work. this album just 'pimped' itself with the appeal of how jazzy and funky it was rather than actually being good songs."
KendrickLamar,322ryh,Headshot_,4,Mon Apr 20 07:47:41 2015 UTC,"I know this sounds too circlejerk-y, but personally, TPAB is the best album I've ever heard."
KendrickLamar,322ryh,scenerymc,3,Sat Apr 11 04:50:48 2015 UTC,I honestly prefer gkmc over tpab but tpab is still a great album and it wasn't a disappointment.  Currently listening to sec.80 and loving it
KendrickLamar,322ryh,StepOsets,5,Sat Apr 11 04:56:55 2015 UTC,"a lot of people don't understand the music behind butterfly.  In GKMC the music was refined, production was modern.  The subject matter was kendrick's past, his roots.  The juxtaposition of that is modern subject matter aka what the fk is going on today with music from kendrick's past and hip hop's roots.  Its fkin brilliant.  the people disappointed with butterfly wanted to hear a GKMC2.  they dont realize they are listening to the REAL GKMC2 when what they desire musically is a just copy-paste of GKMC."

KendrickLamar,322ryh,Hi_Im_Small_Text_Bot,2,Sat Apr 11 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"GKMC was more than an album. It had amazing songs, insanely catchy hooks, deep lyrics, insane beats, and told the story of Kendricks teenage troubles in compton. Truly amazing, and although TPAB was really good, not as good as GKMC."
KendrickLamar,322ryh,zachintheb0x,3,Sun Apr 12 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"yes, i don't know why people keep acting like one has catchy music while the other has good lyrics, and it's just a tradeoff of which you prefer. no. GKMC had it ALL which was what made Kendrick such a god. and also, same thing for people who say one album was full of bangers and the other is more jazzy and funky. again, WRONG. GKMC had both, blended in perfectly."

I prefer his other work more but by no means is tpab bad or a dissapointment. I am so happy that there is a artist that isn't scared to throw something so different out there, that just shows King Kendrick cares about the music not the fame"
KendrickLamar,322ryh,b-mint94,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:57:29 2015 UTC,"huge disappointment. initially, I was mortified. I was so hyped after GKMC (my favorite rap album of all time) and I just wanted to die after I first heard to pimp a butterfly. just nothing really 'great'. just 'ok' and not as memorable work.   I've listened many times and most of the songs have grown on me, I enjoy them somewhat and kendrick is great and all but still nothing is ""amazing"" and really well developed work. I would never listen to pretty much any songs just as songs except for King Kunta, These Walls, and The Blacker the Berry. The rest of it is ok enough that I can appreciate and like most of it as I'm listening but it boggles my mind that everybody fanboys over this album.  It's really not well done musically in terms of being extremely memorable and perfect. I think lyrically it's fantastic and powerful, and I love jazz as well as funk, but I feel like Kendrick lost track of his own style with this album. It sounds like a cover album. It's less his original style and more the novelty of being jazzy and funky as if it's impressive to choose a musical style for an album. Don't get me wrong, I've always loved that Kendrick doesn't just try to be radio friendly for the sake of being top 40, just happens to be amazing enough that everybody loves him, and he has always had jazzy and funky influences.  He just completely lost track of what made his music great for this album, and he didn't do vocals for any catchy choruses, which was what made GKMC so great. his voice and style and choruses are out of this world. he even had ""i"" released months earlier which was fantastic, amazing production and song, and a pretty good chorus with nice vocal effect. It was a complete reinvention of himself. Then he put a shitty live version with someone else singing the chorus which didn't sound right, and cut out the last 1/3 of the song to do a spoken word a cappella rap. on a studio album. fucking awful. if you want to put the NEGUS rap on the album, either blend it into a song well, or put the live version of i with the skit as a BONUS track. that just pissed me off so much. please do not try to tell me that it makes kendrick an amazing person that he had the balls to put a live version instead of just wanting a radio friendly song, and that the skit was so powerful that it makes it a better song. fuck you. should not have been on the album.   I like 11/16 songs which is a 69/100, and of the ones I like, there are some imperfections that annoy me, and overall the completeness of the album all factored in, I give it a 60/100, which also accounts for the parts of the other 5/16 songs that I do like, but I don't like those songs on the whole. ""Alright"" for example would have been one of the best of the album if kendrick did the chorus instead of that goofy ass pharell williams part. cmon, it just sounds so nerdy and goofy. it's just wrong. failed chorus. kendrick says the first ""alright, right, right"" why didn't he just continue?  anyways, I don't think it's fair for anybody to say ""just because it's a different style of music that doesn't take pressure from a label to sound like other modern hip hop makes it worse?!"" I just genuinely think his personal style suffered in this album and I think he could have done it a hell of a lot better. Even though I do find most of the songs ok, I firmly hold my opinion and rate the album as a whole work 60/100, and I find it absurd for anybody to rate it in the 80's-90's range.   for the guy who said ""it's got 6 money trees on it"" below, thats hilarious. it has 0. it wasn't going for that kind of song in any of them on TPAB, the kind that you can really sink your teeth into. And I've never understood why people say GKMC was just as hard to get into. are you fucking kidding me? It was an instant classic, every single song was unique, incredible beats production lyrics and songwriting, really full development and just memorable at every step of the way. He managed to blend jazz, funk, and hip hop flawlessly while writing great lyrics and ALSO making one of the biggest radio and party friendly albums ever without being generic.   GKMC is a whole other calibre of album, and TPAB falls flat on its ass in comparison. You may be less opposed to the album than I am but comparing them is just nonsense. they are not comparable albums."
KendrickLamar,320uqq,Onepieceop101,13,Thu Apr 9 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"It's actually not only the best choice for the first song of the album, it's the only one. In order for us to see Kdot overcome adversity we need to see what it looks like and where he grows from. In this song we see his fears, vices and mistakes that would later haunt him on U.   Besides that it also sets the tone for the rest of the album. Well produced, jazzy, unconventional and groovy. One of the best tracks in the entire album imo"
KendrickLamar,320uqq,sulmagnificent,4,Thu Apr 9 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"I love this song, correct me if I'm wrong but it features George Clinton right? I can definitaly hear the influence in the funky ass bass. Chorus has a good hook. Love the intro to the verse ""When I get signed homie imma act a fool""   It's clear this song is about spending money on stupid shit and encouraging you to save your money for the things that really matter."
KendrickLamar,320uqq,TiitsMcgeee,4,Fri Apr 10 16:53:41 2015 UTC,"It's about the tax man, I don't fully understand it but Kendrick is trying to teach people not to spend every penny you have or the tax man will Wesley Snipe your ass.  That's what I get out of this song."

KendrickLamar,320uqq,TheAllStarrBand,6,Thu Apr 9 18:27:18 2015 UTC,Kendrick shouldn't have changed the order of the album solely to appeal to more people...
KendrickLamar,320uqq,ANAL_CHAKRA,1 point,Fri Apr 10 10:36:55 2015 UTC,"Very true, but if his goal here was to spread a message to black youth, making some of the earlier songs very experimental will put some people off. In fact, most of the album might put some people off. These people might say the music is ""gay"" or ""not hood enough."" Sadly, many of these types of people are the ones I believe Kendrick wants to reach out to the most.   I think Kendrick is the best rapper alive but I want him to achieve his message in a way that actually resonates with the inner city youth, which is what he wants too. If his music is too experimental it may go unnoticed by some of the youth. In addition the lyrics on this album weren't as easily perceptible or pertinent to youth issues as GKMC. I know he has a point and it gets expressed a lot, but without digging heavily into the lyrics it's harder to figure out. Whereas in GKMC it was very clearly about the evils of gangs, drugs, alcohol, peer pressure, how our society encourages those things, and finally what we can do about it."

But the way this woman is reacting, acting like Dark Blacks and Light Blacks are practically two different species, is absurd.   Not denying that ""colorism"" is an issue within the Black community, which should be discussed, but the hatred and venom projected at Kendrick by that woman is completely out of wack and doesn't help anything.   And considering Kendrick's history with his fiancÃ©, that he's been dating her for 10 years, ever since they met in High School, when he had NOTHING, and she's been by his side through all of this, makes it really hard to try to paint their relationship and his desire to marry her as anything other than just real love, plain and simple."

KendrickLamar,30cpar,xlearningisfunx,12,Thu Mar 26 08:11:32 2015 UTC,"I really dislike this article, they could have conveyed their point without throwing Kanye and Taylor some shade, especially since Kanye has had a large influence on modern hip hop. Taylor too, she's basically the biggest role model for young girls out there, without having to rely on sexualizing herself at least.  I fucking love TPAB, but this article makes it seem it's so far ahead of everybody else when it's not. It's a great album, a personal 10/10, maybe the best of the decade so far, but certainly not so far ahead of everybody else it. Hell, I can name 3 Kanye West albums on it's level easily if the author really wants to compare him and Kendrick, but doing that is not fair to either of them especially since they both have a mutual admiration for one another."
KendrickLamar,30cpar,Venusaurite,2,Thu Mar 26 12:49:30 2015 UTC,"It seems like the author is fed up with the misuse of fame, or not using it to its full potential. Which is interesting because it's a topic Kendrick wrestles with on TPaB. For Kanye, musically, yes, his albums can go toe-to-toe with Kendrick's, but the message in them is extremely self-absorbed and contributes very little to the discussion of race, power, or money.  Swift, who you say has a huge platform, still doesn't go far enough, I don't think. Sure, she isn't sexualizing herself, which is great as she is a role-model, but she still sends this shallow message that women need boys, or relationships, for value/happiness. That's not a good message to send out.  Kendrick, however, admits his own shortcomings, and is very honest with his discussion and where he wants society to trend towards. He's very active in trying to speak out against black-on-black crime/violence as well as encouraging people to better their situations and not blame other races, the government, or ""the man"" in general. To me, this is what the article targets. Not the size of the platform, or the validity of the musical qualities of their respective albums, but what the artists are doing with their platform. And in that regard, Kendrick seems far above anyone else at the top of the music industry."
KendrickLamar,30cpar,Forever_Flaccid,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"@FF I feel what you want to talk about, but this isn't a great place for the discussion, honestly. Some of us are trying to talk about how to bring a people up and our own complicity while others are still trying to divide and conquer, even as lamar preaches self-love and unity.   I think your overrating the message brought by TPAB.   Yeah, sounds about discussing TPAB in the kendrick lamar subreddit.  Tell me more about your rating on this Black Excellence message, please."
KendrickLamar,30cpar,Venusaurite,2,Thu Mar 26 15:16:30 2015 UTC,"Tell me more about your rating on this Black Excellence message, please.   I'm saying he's acting like Kendrick Lamar is the only artist to ever talk about social issues. He's not. If you want a more recent example there's Black Messiah by D'Angelo (not hip hop though), but the sort of people who listen to TPAB probably have listened to albums by Tupac, Nas, Public Enemy... really the list of ""black artists who have covered this message already"" is too big to name, because these same concepts have been driving hip hop for over 30 years now.  And it's not like songs off TPAB are going to get major radio play either."
KendrickLamar,30cpar,Forever_Flaccid,2,Thu Mar 26 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"Did I say that rap artists have never taken to this issue on the microphone before? I'm saying he's the only one with a platform as big as his that's currently doing it, specially when placed up against Kanye and Taylor. You're upset with the author for 'throwing shade' and I'm pointing out that the author seems to be lauding Kendrick for using his platform to try to change things, while others simply use it for their own ego, or to vent about their shitty relationship life. When did I ever say Kendrick is doing it right and Tupac and Nas had it all wrong?"
KendrickLamar,30cpar,Venusaurite,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:53:04 2015 UTC,"You're upset with the author for 'throwing shade' and I'm pointing out that the author seems to be lauding Kendrick for using his platform to try to change things, while others simply use it for their own ego, or to vent about their shitty relationship life.   Because both those things are a gross generalization of what the artists actually talk about, Kanye's description only refers to maybe 2 of his 6 albums, while Taylor's was her singles from 2 years back (I don't know, I don't listen to her albums but she's changed the content of her singles recently). The author also insinuated that Kendrick was so far ahead of Kanye and Taylor that he shouldn't care what they say, also wrong.   When did I ever say Kendrick is doing it right and Tupac and Nas had it all wrong?   When did I imply that? I'm saying that people who say Kendrick is breaking boundaries with his messages or are so far ahead of everybody else (like the author) are wrong, ESPECIALLY when the people who actually digest full albums nowadays won't hear anything new that they haven't from other hip hop albums.  Funny you should say Kendrick's not doing it for his own ego when his biggest (and really only successful) singles of the last year or so was a song about him loving himself, and one about him being a king. Obviously that again is not what those songs are actually about, but it does sound like it to the mainstream public who don't listen to albums in their full context.  I appreciate TPAB for it's sound and theme, but I don't expect too many people to actually learn from it, let alone for it to push any lyrical boundaries (except for concept albums).  So TL;DR, people who listen to a lot of hip hop won't hear many if any new ideas from TPAB, while people who will only hear his singles think he's rapping about how great he is."

KendrickLamar,30cpar,Forever_Flaccid,0,Thu Mar 26 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"I think your overrating the message brought by TPAB. The concepts Kendrick talk about are nothing new, very little (if anything) of what Kendrick talks about hasn't been discussed by a whole host of rappers already, let alone many other RnB, funk, and spoken word artists.   but she still sends this shallow message that women need boys, or relationships, for value/happiness   That's wrong, she's mostly talking about handling breakups, or that liking boys isn't wrong, or even being yourself.   but the message in them is extremely self-absorbed and contributes very little to the discussion of race, power, or money.   Kanye's messages are too varied for you to say that. He talks about flaws in the education system and family for his first album and emotional pain in his fourth, you're only right about Yeezus and Graduation. But even then those are about expressing his emotions in different ways. In MBDTF/LR the messages varied in every track so it's hard to generalize.  Are their messages as strong as Kendrick's? No, but that's fine. It's stupid to criticize artists for that. Would you criticize Win Butler or Sufjan Stevens for that? I wouldn't."
KendrickLamar,30cpar,Venusaurite,2,Thu Mar 26 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"Well, we can all go home, guys. You heard it here first. Kendrick's message isn't new, so it isn't shit. Let's all go listen to Action Bronson's new album!"
KendrickLamar,30cpar,DJackalz,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"Kendrick's message isn't new, so it isn't shit. Let's all go listen to Action Bronson's new album!   What are you trying to imply? You guys and the author in the OP are acting like Kendrick's some sort of savior of hip hop because he's conscious."
KendrickLamar,30cpar,Cadenca,3,Thu Mar 26 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm saying a message doesn't have to be new to be impacting. And Kendrick is delivering the message to a newer generation of hip-hop listeners and carrying on the legacy of those who have gone before him, so-to-speak. You're acting like Kendrick's message is old, and therefore not relevant and shouldn't get him praise. I'm saying he's using his platform to spread a message of love and self-inspection rather than one of egoism, or finding worth in others. Apparently I'm not allowed to love him over other artists for that because it's not original."
KendrickLamar,30e4t5,109876ers,3,Thu Mar 26 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"Black Excellence is a message for all America and i'm sick of reading people try to tear it down not realizing that when one section of america prospers all of america prospers.  Open your eyes and look at exactly what good black fatalism will do for our contry then come back and tell me about how this black excellence anthem album is ""alright, i guess but let me tell you about this other track i heard by Drake...""  edit:  For the rest of you Negus we need to look up and mind the narrative, don't let this become just another ""concept"" album- speak up and be heard."
KendrickLamar,30e4t5,109876ers,-1,Thu Mar 26 17:21:01 2015 UTC,This is a pretty immature thing to post. The album isn't pro-black. It's more pro-eqaulity. Someone who doesnt like the sound or lyricism isn't a racist
KendrickLamar,30e4t5,109876ers,2,Thu Mar 26 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"You honestly believe that To Pimp a butterfly isn't both pro black and pro-equality?  Here's a question, what happens to society when black people have the believe they can achieve anything? How is that at all at odds with a pro-equality message?  Just because he says black is amazing doesn't mean he says anything is less and if you think this is a ""pro-equality"" album without being ""black empowerment"", well, i guess i'd just say give it a listen again.  Dude literally shouts the message all over the record, are you kidding me not pro-black?  I will say this is excellent commentary on the immediate counter-reaction to any sort of pro-black message as if anything positive about black people directed towards black people is racist in some way even if the entire album calls us to task on our own complicity in continuing racism.   Why wouldn't you as an american celebrate black culture? Didn't you hear that we're one people, bro?"
KendrickLamar,30e4t5,109876ers,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, and if you don't like the fact that i used 12 years a slave to make a point, tell me about why it would be at all inappropriate to reclaim black imagery to make my own point in any way?  The entire album was about reclaiming the pride of being black,  ""I'm black as the heart of an aryan"" ""I'm a proud monkey""  Basically you can't take that last generation garbage and hurt me. So we want to talk about slavery all the time? Cool, i can talk about it as it relates to my message and i don't have to apologize or feel ""racist"" about it because there's now a cultural value around remind black people to stay quiet about race because it's not for ""polite company"".  edit:   ""The first thought i had when hearing TPAB was how much it sounded like my favorite white artist, Aesop Rock- DAE reddit""?

KendrickLamar,30djgu,LupeTheKiller,5,Thu Mar 26 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the caterpillar/butterfly refers solely to Kendrick, it refers to any black person trying to escape their situation using their talents. The butterflies are the ones who have ""made it"" (Kendrick, Jay-Z, Kanye etc.) who have actually managed to achieve success through their talent. The caterpillars pimping the butterfly would be others (Shug Knight, Birdman, the music industry in general) who take advantage of that talent for their own gain. The caterpillars in general represent the black population in America. Many caterpillars don't survive to become butterflies in the same way that many black people never escape the ghetto.   I'm not as sure about the cocoon but I think it represents black people who become blinded by their wealth and influence and simply flaunt it instead of using it to help others achieve the same (think Maybach Music style rap). By not using their influence for any positive goal, these rappers become institutionalised and ""part of the system"".  That's my take on it anyhow"
KendrickLamar,30djgu,not-a-celebrity,3,Thu Mar 26 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"So more from the perspective as a young kid in Compton and what he sees growing up, not what Kendrick experienced personally? But the end of this poem and whole CD is so introspective that I think he's talking about himself.   I think he refers to himself as a caterpillar still once he finally made it and he saw the butterfly as successful artists that white America loves. I think this kinda goes at too how he attacked these successful rappers in the BET cypher and control verse. He seems to be hung up on the BET cypher a lot in Institutionalized I believe, which seems to back up my interpretation. However that same society doesn't love this creativity from him, instead he was pressured to become a ghetto rapper and dumb it down essentially. This caused him to be forced within the hood life still, the cocoon, but Kendrick still had these creative thoughts and ideas running thru his mind so they took root and this album is him embracing that creative side and finally being a free butterfly"
KendrickLamar,30djgu,not-a-celebrity,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:57:27 2015 UTC,I think Kendrick is a caterpillar but not the only caterpillar. I saw it as more of a metaphor for the challenge involved to escape from the ghetto and the mindset that traps so many people there. There are a lot of potential interpretations though which is part of what make this album great.
KendrickLamar,30djgu,tightastic,3,Thu Mar 26 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"I understand this to be a comment on black culture and how blacks are treated in america as a whole. Kendrick sees that all black people are seen as caterpillars - that is, only being capable of consumption and destruction (crime, gang violence). In reality, though, there are a great many black people that are butterflies - they are intelligent and talented individuals, but growing up in the ghetto and general perceptions about black people keep them trapped in the hood lifestyle. Then he brings up another serious issue - that even when some caterpillars evolve into butterflies, they are exploited (pimped) by record companies and corporations to be cash cows, rather than true artists.  As an artists form the hood, Kendrick has had a lot of struggles with his new found influence and money, that's really what the whole album is about. He got huge after GKMC and the fame and money got to him (Welsey's Theory, King Kunta, These Walls, For Sale). He lost sight of his beliefs for a time, and became very upset with himself ( u, Alright) because he was playing into the expectations of the world. He had been successfully ""pimped"" by society. However, he realizes this and returns to his roots(Momma, Hood Politics). He remembers the hard work he took to get where he is, and learns to love himself again(i). He also comes to terms with the platform he has, and uses it to bring awareness to the real problems in society(Basically every track from How Much a Dollar Cost to the end). Namely, the mistreatment of blacks. The poem pretty much sums up at the end of the record. This poem is beautiful, and has more depth than I have mentioned here, but this is my basic reading of it and the album as a whole."
KendrickLamar,30djgu,kingkdot,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:10:47 2015 UTC,"I think Kendrick is rapping in present tense (as a butterfly) about when he use to be a caterpillar, maybe in the era of N.W.A and west coast rap legends. And then maybe GKMC talks about his whole process in the cocoon (Compton) and then at the end of ""Real"" on GKMC when his Mom says he needs to com back home he realizes this. Now this is  a long shot, but maybe at the end of GKMC when the tape pops out and ends, Kendrick is really in the cocoon still listening and when the tape stops he then became the butterfly and realized he needed to explain his transformation, and then TPAB was the product."

However, in the end it's not that different he is still materialistic and consumed with the gang culture, the same sins that he had to deal with in Compton.  All of these sins come from ""Lucy"" or Lucifer. In the end though if he is able to effect any kind of positive change back in Compton because of his status it is worth fighting for change.  ""Wings began to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant.""  The butterfly, or Kendrick now, brings attention to social issues and proposes solutions ""sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered"".  He is trying to turn ""caterpillars"" in the hood to ""butterflies"" because they are all brothers ""they are one and the same."""

KendrickLamar,303ja5,Marenum,2,Tue Mar 24 20:21:18 2015 UTC,Hence why it always seems like English teachers are annotating Rap Genius. Literary skills are key.
KendrickLamar,303ja5,eklxtreme,2,Tue Mar 24 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"It's true. I took a class on hip hop when I was going after an English degree. The professor was a really smart, very cool guy. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he spent time on Rap Genius."
KendrickLamar,303ja5,Marenum,3,Tue Mar 24 21:34:17 2015 UTC,"Rap Genius definitely helps a ton, when trying to understand lyrics, especially the deeper ones."

Kendrick isn't the slowest rapper.  Even then, it's great for understanding what he's really saying. Illmatic became a lot more to me after I read through the lyrics/meaning on there."

Just move on :)   In my opinion, this isn't classic Kendrick. Is that a bad thing? Nope. I love this new album because it's his expression of his emotions which is truly art."

Rather than reclaiming (and thus softening) the word âniggerâ by using âniggaâ, Kendrick suggests that blacks should have tried to replace it with ânegusâ, which has an unambiguously positive connotation and could have united black communities.

His older song ""Gemini"" is about his mood swings and inability to keep a consistent mood. Saying that he's bipolar is reasonable and makes a whole lot of sense.

It's also open to your interpretation.    The first thing I personally thought is acid.  Kendrick has distanced himself from drugs, but he has enough references to drugs in his music that I think he's done enough of them to understand them. My personal view."
KendrickLamar,2zsgzu,xxtruthxx,1 point,Sat Mar 21 08:34:09 2015 UTC,"I've got a lot of friends who are struggling with Kendrick's stance on racism in America. One of my closest friends who's been a die-hard fan since Section.80 says he won't listen to Kendrick anymore after ""The Blacker the Berry, "" saying the song is the worst thing for black America that Lamar could've made.  I don't share that view in any way, but my friends grown up a black Muslim and I'm white so I can't really dismiss his opinion without considering that idea."

KendrickLamar,2zqzs9,poppingfresh,7,Fri Mar 20 22:32:23 2015 UTC,"You really do have to listen to GKMC in order, to get the message. I personally always use rapgenius to decipher what the lyrics mean. As for the story, it is about Kendrick's struggles while growing up in Compton. The story starts off with Kendrick meeting a girl named Sherane, who later sets him up and has her cousins jump him. Kendrick and his friends retaliate, by getting into a gunfight with the guys who jumped him. They manage to get a few of them, but not before Kendricks friend Dave has been fatally wounded. This is a major turning point in the album/Kendricks life, because this is when he decides that he doesn't want to end up being another dead gangbanger. So he dedicates his life to singing about the evils of gang life/his life. There is a lot more happening in the album that I didn't include, but that's because I think you should listen to it again in order."
KendrickLamar,2zqzs9,crossbow789,3,Fri Mar 20 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"That's the incorrect thing to say. It is best to not hear good kid, m. A. A. d. City out of order because when heard in the correct order, it creates an atmosphere for the listener that is unmatched by other albums, which is why it has such a high stature in hip hop. There aren't that many albums of this caliber and if you listen to the songs out of order, you get a general theme but you do not get cohesion as you would if you listen from tracks 1 to 12. The reason why I said it's incorrect to say that you should listen to an album in a specific way is because that takes away the fun of an album and art in that regard. People interpret art differently so if you like listening out of order, then more power to you. You just get cohesion more when you listen in order and with GKMC, the concept is easier to follow."
KendrickLamar,2zqzs9,Dubious_X,1 point,Sat Mar 21 00:01:49 2015 UTC,But doesn't listening to an album out of order make it a lot harder to follow along? It seems like the equivalent of reading a book at random chapters.
KendrickLamar,2zqzs9,crossbow789,2,Sat Mar 21 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"In my opinion GKMC has a lot more solid singles when listened to individually, or out of order, compared to TPAB. That's how I've listened to it quite a few times, and it's more like reading a bunch of good short stories than random chapters. Now, it's much better in order, but it's still very good on shuffle, in my opinion.  To Pimp a Butterfly is another story, because out of order it truly is like reading random chapters of a book. The songs are evidently much, much better listened to in order, as it is very cohesive. I can't listen to it on shuffle without having the urge to skip a few songs to be honest."
KendrickLamar,2zqzs9,Suck_Mah_Wang,1 point,Sat Mar 21 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"I look at it as a challenge but I typically tend to listen to albums in order. Art can be perceived in so many different ways so it's not like there is one clear cut meaning, which leads to multiple interpretations. That's how i view it."
KendrickLamar,2zqzs9,Dubious_X,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:02:32 2015 UTC,"The message is actually overarching, an example of this is For Free isn't just about sherane but slavery and the system taking from the poor."
KendrickLamar,2zqzs9,Rad_Randy,3,Sat Mar 21 10:29:54 2015 UTC,"For Free is such a strange track. Me and a friend were listening to this song, when Kendrick did the last part of the verse, me and my friend looked at each other in amazement. How did he rap all that without taking a breath?  I looked up the lyrics and was surprised how much he was rhyming about in such a short time.  The depth of that song with only one minute of rapping is mind blowing!"

Musically, it answers to the call of both Coltrane and 2Pac, bending soul, funk, jazz, classic hip-hop, current rap, and even spoken word into something completely new and fresh and exciting to listen to. It grooves, it jams, itâs equal parts subtle and trunk-rattling. The mastering is awesome. It sounds great.""  I think that's a really great way to say it"

Alcohol, drugs, women, and of course, money become readily available and all can enable dangerous lifestyles. He is trying to push the rap game and rep Compton and he cannot do that if he gets caught up in the glamor of being a celebrity or in the gang life in Compton. Kendrick's biggest vice is money. A recurring theme in his music is not giving into the desire for material wealth. He believes lavish spending signals someone is rapping for the money instead of the game (""you boo boo, you teed, turnt down, you thirsty"" in Cut You Off in OD J Cole has a similar rhetoric e.g., Let Nas Down and Workout."

Usually when people say if these walls could talk they're referring to something vulgar"
KendrickLamar,2zpaxh,JSN111,2,Fri Mar 20 15:23:58 2015 UTC,Well the first and 2nd verses are about the woman's vaginal walls. The metaphor of that. And then the 3rd verse changes more to about the walls of the human psyche. So is the intro just there because Kendrick is having sex with this woman whose man is locked up?
KendrickLamar,2zpaxh,gokovi27,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"""All the meaningless sex he's been as of late""? Unless they broke up recently I'm pretty sure Kendrick has a girlfriend and that they've been together for a long time. Not 100% on that because they don't go out in public much."

KendrickLamar,2zkwz8,mr_jiffy,2,Fri Mar 20 00:30:55 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely collusion on the score for big titles. For the smaller albums it seems that different reviewers bang out reviews and at times they are thorough and at other times they are extremely lazy and you can tell the reviewer only listened to the album a couple of times.  For big name albums, it gets pretty predictable. There was actually someone on Reddit a little while ago who predicted two different pitchfork scores for albums before the reviews came out.   As someone who used to follow Pitchfork, but then got very sick of it for all of these reasons, you start to notice certain trends. It's pretty hard to take them seriously after a while."

KendrickLamar,2zldjg,Fishyboyy,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:17:17 2015 UTC,It definitely bumps but the lyrics and the emotions are way too abrasive foe me to call it a banger. Basically if I can imagine getting down to it at a party I consider it a banger.
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,Brasso26,3,Sat Mar 21 07:32:20 2015 UTC,"King Kunta and i are probably the two closest to ""banger"" songs on TPAB, but they're not quite there imo."
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,Brasso26,2,Thu Mar 19 16:34:16 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why you wouldn't consider ""Alright"" a banger? I use this song because this song Imo is 100% a banger."
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,acardenas913,2,Thu Mar 19 16:39:49 2015 UTC,it totally would be be if it had a deeper/louder beat and lost the jazz. that's just my opinion though.
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,neverquenched,2,Thu Mar 19 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Damn, if losing the jazz makes it a banger, then fuck bangers because I love everything about this album."
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,CaptainPhillips1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 05:34:51 2015 UTC,Yeah ok I understand a very valid point.
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,CaptainPhillips1,3,Thu Mar 19 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"Allow me to refer you to Tom Haverford, who explains it succinctly:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ONY-RzqB7E"
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,Itsthinking,7,Fri Mar 20 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"Well for hip hop, bangers are mostly associated with Trap. However there are some songs Kenny has that are bangers like m.a.A.D city (although I'd say just for the beginning). Kendrick isn't focused on making bangers but I'm pretty sure if he wanted to he could. I like playing ""i"" in the car preferably the single version. Bangers are pretty much what u said stuff u would jam out with, with your boys. Your not gonna all tryna get hyped listening to Sing About Me."
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,Scorch8482,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:22:15 2015 UTC,"I hear people say that there are no bangers on TPAB and that's a good thing. Although I disagree and I think that there are bangers, if there weren't I don't think I would want to listen to the album. I mean I know that ""mortal man"" and ""u"" are great songs in the context of the album but if it didn't have ""i"" or ""Alright"" or other ""bangers"" I would just get bored. Every album needs bangers to keep people interested. Even Pink Floyd had ""money""."
KendrickLamar,2zldjg,sukamacoc,2,Thu Mar 19 16:35:28 2015 UTC,I haven't been able to fully serenade the album yet I've only listened to it twice I need to listen to it 18 times before I make my final decision on it
KendrickLamar,2zk4y7,Captainaddy44,21,Thu Mar 19 06:03:43 2015 UTC,i too enjoy unknowingly shuffling to u and being greeted by AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

KendrickLamar,2zk4y7,LanoverHD,5,Thu Mar 19 06:43:53 2015 UTC,"'U' scares the crap out of me honestly, I don't know why though. The screaming at the start totally got me off guard even if the previous song mentioned him in a hotel room screaming.   The second part is what gets me, the beat is haunting and the subject matter is unsettling to me. I would never listen to this song on it's own as brilliant as it is, only when listening to the whole album.   Also a lot of people I know did this with GKMC and this TPAB which can change how the album is perceived."
KendrickLamar,2zk4y7,OrangeScarface,1 point,Thu Mar 19 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"Hahaha.   But for real tho, first listen to the album this nigga put it on shuffle. It's people like him that contribute to Kendrick not being as lauded for his artistry amongst the general population; almost none of Kendrick's songs are bangers (and there are certainly none on this album), wtf are you expecting?"
KendrickLamar,2zk4y7,TheRittyl,3,Thu Mar 19 07:08:54 2015 UTC,"I actually feel like listening to this album on shuffle isn't as much of a big deal as it would be with GKMC. Of course, if you're trying to take in this album as a body of work and ingest it's message, then you absolutely should listen through in order. However, this album doesn't flow like a story like GKMC does, and it doesn't really take you on a journey through a track-by-track basis, and instead is a few messages that are explained through every track and tied together in the final track.    Just some thoughts. For the record, I'm absolutely in love with this album, I cannot believe he made something on par with or possibly surpassing GKMC. No one thought it could be done.    Long live King Kendrick."
KendrickLamar,2zk4y7,Conhairs,2,Thu Mar 19 08:48:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all points. I even told him that it's not a huge deal, as compared to GKMC (which he couldn't get behind and that's whatever), just as you said. But you really lose out on the coherency and the general flow and immersion which I believe is integral in a veritable Kendrick listening session."
KendrickLamar,2zk4y7,Forever_Flaccid,1 point,Thu Mar 19 08:53:45 2015 UTC,I've listened to the album about 10 times all the way through. Shuffling it would mess it up.

KendrickLamar,2zgyfa,sawnod,15,Wed Mar 18 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"I imagine most of you are familiar with Fantano, but for those that aren't: he is very conservative with giving out high scores, let alone 10's. If you go through his reviews, you'll see some fan-loved albums getting 6's. He approaches it as objectively as he can, and backs up all of his opinions about each track really well in his videos. This review marks his 3rd 10/10 rating, out of all of his reviews (he has also reviewed and not rated some older ""classic"" albums that he considers very highly rated, maybe even 10's, but without giving an actual rating). When Fantano gives a 10, it's a huge deal."
KendrickLamar,2zgyfa,BostonSwashbuckler,5,Wed Mar 18 20:15:11 2015 UTC,What are the other two he gave 10's to?

KendrickLamar,2zj0gc,PepeSylvia11,6,Wed Mar 18 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"I know self-promotion is frowned upon, but I felt the need to put my review here for people who are interested if they're curious.   Such a remarkable album I had to add an extra two paragraphs to my typical five paragraph write-up. There's just so much to To Pimp A Butterfly it's seriously overwhelming at times, but it's so rewarding when you witness it all piece together.   Kendrick did it again, and did it in an entirely new way bringing Hip-Hop back to its roots, something we hardly knew he could even accomplish. I wonder if Kendrick will turn into Kanye in that each album is going to attempt to tackle a different sub-genre? If anyone can do it it's him."
KendrickLamar,2zivp4,RynB93,2,Wed Mar 18 23:03:45 2015 UTC,I personally prefer album covers without the titles because they look so much cleaner
KendrickLamar,2zihro,Warlordthewinner,11,Wed Mar 18 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"I got a bone to pick (see what I did there?) with how everybody is saying you cannot compare this album to S80 or GKMC. Both of them had heavy elements of identifying social issues and bringing them to the attention of the people. TPaB does the same, and is mostly focused at finding answers and solutions to these very problems, and Kendrick tries to lead his listeners to these answers. I'd say one would be very justified in calling TPaB a follow up to both S80 and GKMC. Each album is a different story being told, but they're all out of the same book that Kendrick is writing."
KendrickLamar,2zihro,PM-ME-UR-ART,7,Wed Mar 18 21:27:05 2015 UTC,I got a bone to pick.    HE MAD

KendrickLamar,2zihro,Lagose,2,Thu Mar 19 12:30:54 2015 UTC,This is only somewhat relevant but it's really enjoyable to listen to TPAB first and GKMC second. It's as if TPAB is discussing the problems and issues in society/the hood/politics/etc and then GKMC is all of those problems personified in a day in Kendrick's life. I know TPAB is second chronologically but I feel like listening to TPAB first and GKMC second (with the themes of TPAB in mind) is an extremely powerful experience

KendrickLamar,2zihro,dan0314,2,Thu Mar 19 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"I loved the music on GKMC, and I found it really hard to relate to TPAB. I can relate to GKMC because I grew up in a similar environment."
KendrickLamar,2zihro,mr_jiffy,9,Thu Mar 19 01:01:14 2015 UTC,This is what I don't understand. TPAB is Kendrick reflecting back on that same environment and how it affected him.
KendrickLamar,2zihro,sukamacoc,0,Thu Mar 19 01:16:36 2015 UTC,"I also didn't really like the funky vibe. King kunta is good, and blacker the berry. Other than that, eh. Maybe hood politics"
KendrickLamar,2zi0mr,yoloswagy,3,Wed Mar 18 19:16:21 2015 UTC,Can you give some insight? I'm very interested in what you mean by that.
KendrickLamar,2zi0mr,rejus_crust,3,Wed Mar 18 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry I was on mobile and stoned so I was just gonna come back and edit. BUT. I dunno. It still feels like a sequel to GKMC in a way. Its not very obvious but he mentions a lot of topics he mentioned directly in TPaB. So the sequel element I think. GKMC for the most part had one straightforward topic and story, like Arkham Asylum. In AA you're just in one small area, but its still dense and full of things to discover. But then AC came along and FUCKED everything up. You could explore a whole God damn city. TPaB covers a bunch of different topics that are all still intertwining. Also the reception, like critically. AA was extremely praised and called one of the best superhero games of all time, but now it feels like TPaB is doing even better."

KendrickLamar,2zes9f,Peeners,19,Tue Mar 17 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"Momma  Kendrick comes back home in the second half of the album. The beginning of the entire album begins with Kendrickâs love and lust for fame/success and here is just wanting to get your dick sloppy-sucked. I donât think itâs unintentional. Kendrickâs comparing his own enjoyment from all that to someone back in his hometown trying to bust a nut, who isnât too different from Kendrick back then.   Heâs thinking about when he was a new rapper in hip hop. Lack of experience held him back at first. It took time to master his writing style and rapping. Now itâs all changed, but itâs still a humbling experience to be in Compton again. Kendrickâs glad heâs gotten grammys and awards, but even happier that his rap career brought him back home. Itâs like the city was waiting to embrace him again. Although heâs thought to have known all there was (the fame/street smarts/himself/his avoidance of greed/life), he realizes he didnât know shit until he came home.   He meets a little kid who reminds him of himself. The kid looks up to Kendrick Lamar, idolizes him. The child isnât well off and spends his days getting into trouble and tricking strangers for money. âHe looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language. You just forgot because of what public schools had painted.â He tells Kendrick that he mustâve been like him, but forgot it after going to school. He continues with advice to remember the hood, that the big life spoils those in it and blinds them to what actual progress is, rather than the bullshit progress they think they make. The kid finishes with telling him to tell all his homies to come back home, just as Kendrick did.   Meeting this kid pushed Kendrick into a state of confusion. What does he truly want? Heâs been looking his entire life for this meaning and purpose, but it eludes him. Is it in women? Money? Mankind? He canât even begin to describe what it is. Maybe it doesnât exist. Maybe heâs meant to advocate for those without voices..  Hood Politics  One of Kendrickâs friends is scared heâs changing too much from his old self and that he never answers his phone. He tells Kendrick to call back on another friendâs phone. It then seems to be a flashback to the Compton days.   Kendrick mentions being 14 with a .22 caliber pistol and 14 years later (he turns 28 in June) heâs still going hard. He doesnât bother with gang confrontations or rap beef, he lost a friend, Stunna Deuce, to it too. Thereâs just problems everywhere. Drugs, beef, shady police and politics. He says Democrats and Republicans are no better than the Crips and Bloods of Compton. Gangs bring new people in through promises of hope and collective âwatching out for each other,â but if DemoCrips/ReBloodicans spread their lies too, theyâre on the same level to fuck you over. Kendrick also mentions that although Barack Obama is black, it doesnât mean heâs automatically on the side of the black community. Heâs still a Democrat and politician who will prioritize the issues brought to him how he sees fit.   People try to categorize each other (whoâs realest/wack/white/black), but itâs a stupid way to see the world. The world isnât white and black (shout out to the black and white album cover).   âI remember you was conflicted. Misusing your influence. Sometimes I did the same. Abusing my power full of resentment. Resentment that turned into a deep depression. Found myself screaming in a hotel room. I didnât wanna self destruct. The evils of Lucy was all around me. So I went running for answers. Until I came home. But that didnât stop survivorâs guilt. Going back and forth. Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned. Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was. But while my loved ones was fighting. A continuous war back in the city. I was entering a new one.â   This is the third time we hear music go with the poem and it starts immediately after he mentions the word depression. This is on purpose for sure, but itâs an AMAZING subtlety I noticed!! Iâve NEVER seen this in a song before (tell me if otherwise). The music cue begins at the word of a disease that is awful and unrelenting (depression) and sounds really really ominous until he says answers. This is where the second instrument picks up and the whole mood changes completely. This was a concept I came up with (honestly I donât think Iâm the first to come up with this idea) months and months ago when I was planning a particular project where the music/moods would seamlessly adapt to the lyrics/subject matter, but Iâm so fucking amazed Iâve found something like this at a transition point of To Pimp a Butterfly. You guys donât understand how much I appreciate the beauty of this moment. The music quiets at the last three lines to place emphasis on this particular transition point for the listener.   How Much a Dollar Cost  The song begins with the same notes from the end of Hood Politics, going straight to the first verse. âHow much a dollar really cost?â This question has haunted Kendrick for a while. Itâs a tricky question to ask himself because his success has given him confidence heâs never known.   Heâs at a gas station getting gas, but communication was a little hard. âIndigenous African only spoke Zulu. My American tongue was slurry.â Kendrick mightâve been a little hungover too. He leaves and a homeless man asks him for 10 rand (rand is the south african currency), hinting that this setting isnât what we think it is. Kendrick thinks heâs just gonna spend it on crack and refuses his beg for cash. The homeless man tells him itâll feed him twice, but Kendrick tells him to beat it. The man argues that heâs not under any addiction and only needs a single bill, but itâs to no use. Kendrick shuts his car door.   Kendrick stays put and stares at the homeless man with anger, wondering why heâd be mad for not receiving a handout. He didnât cause his homelessness and isnât supposed to save him either. He built his own fortune out of hard work and this guyâs just asking for money. Kendrick's money is his and his only. The homeless man asks him if he ever read Exodus 14 (thanks rap genius, ""tells the story of how Moses parted the Red Seaâ¦about the power one man can have to lead his peopleâ¦â). Kendrick gets angrier and goes off on the homeless guy. He tells him he knows when men are hustling, when theyâre gonna beg for drug money, and every nickel he earns is his, and afterwards, the man reveals that he is God and that Kendrick just lost his place in heaven. This is the cost of a dollar, as a result of Kendrickâs selfishness. Rap Genius says it best:   To a homeless man, a dollar is everything. Itâs the whole world to him. Whereas a dollar is nothing to Kendrick, but much like a lot of people, he is unwilling to give to the homeless man, assuming that it will just go towards drugs and/or alcohol. But actually, itâs less about the dollar and more about having a good heart and being charitable, which is the principle that God teaches throughout the Bible and brings to mind the old phrase, âIt ainât the money, itâs the principle.â  And as a result, in Godâs eyes, that measly dollar was more important to Kendrick than him reserving his place in the Kingdom of Heaven.   Complexion  Now weâre going back to the Kendrickâs references to color and black/white directly. The hook emphasizes its unimportance of society today. He mentions a Zulu love, which I believe references the Ubuntu philosophy that promotes universal human kindness and humanity towards others. So again, who âgive a fuck about your complexion,â weâre all human.   /u/PM-ME-UR-ART said it well:   ""Kendrick created pairs of contrasting songs on a single, unified, and integrated album. This is his goal for society. The stand-out pair of these 8 different juxtapositions is u & i. They're the only titles left uncapitalized, and have the greatest contrast of all the pairs; in terms of content, instrumentals, and emotion delivered to the listener. Kendrick emphasizes this pair in particular as it is one of the main messages of the entire album: he wants to unite you and I, to bring everyone in society together, for you and I to bring others together. On this album, he also speaks on unifying the contrast inside the Black community (opposing gangs, light skins and dark skins, etc.) He seeks to mend the differences that the Black community has created among itself, and have them realize how they are all the same people.""  Rapsody gives us some slick rhymes on the concept on beauty and its universalness. She says weâre all on the same team, regardless of our skin colors. So love yourself and love those around you without prejudice.   âBarefoot babies with no cares.â They donât inherently become part of the evils of the world. This is passed down through the generations. âTeenage gun toters that donât play fair, should I get out the car? I donât see Compton, I see something much worse. The land of the land mines, the hell thatâs on earth."" The bigger picture that Kendrick alludes to is that we are all slaves to the worldâs ideas of skin color and its divisions between each other. Itâs not just America, itâs the entire world, and ghettos throughout it show us (rap genius again folks) they are âphysical manifestations of the evils that plague the world.â"
KendrickLamar,2zes9f,yosry8995,42,Tue Mar 17 23:45:12 2015 UTC,"The Blacker The Berry  âSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? Hypocrite!â  Michael Chabon says all that is needed for this song:  âIn the final couplet, Kendrick Lamar employs a rhetorical move akin to - and in its way even more devastating than - Commonâs move in the last line of âI Used to Love H.E.R.â: snapping an entire lyric into place with a surprise revelation of something hitherto left unspoken. In âH.E.R.â, Common reveals the identity of the songâs âherâ - hip hop itself - forcing the listener to re-evaluate the entire meaning and intent of the song. Here, Kendrick Lamar reveals the nature of the enigmatic hypocrisy that the speaker has previously confessed to three times in the song without elaborating: that he grieved over the murder of Trayvon Martin when he himself has been responsible for the death of a young black man. Commonâs âherâ is not a woman but hip hop itself; Lamarâs âIâ is not (or not only) Kendrick Lamar but his community as a whole. This revelation forces the listener to a deeper and broader understanding of the songâs âyouâ , and to consider the possibility that  âhypocrisyâ is, in certain situations, a much more complicated moral position than is generally allowed, and perhaps an inevitable one.â   You Ainât Gotta Lie  Kendrickâs mom sees right through him. She sees his insecurities. She knows he thought he could come back and hang with his old friends like the old times, but heâs been gone for too much time. She reminds Kendrick that being an entertainer wonât get his message out for change. Talk is only talk, it needs, as Iâve said before, proper intention and action.   He asks himself what he offers to the world and so Kendrick says he isnât going to be a rapper for entertainment like those who seek to impress their fans with money, hoes, and drugs. He isnât going to lie to his fans as many in the hip hop industry do. Heâs going to be himself and pass on messages that he believes our generations need. Kendrick will be realer than most others to make the world a better place.   He tells us to not lie to ourselves and others to enjoy what we have. You donât have to try hard, just let it be.   i  Kendrick goes for this live version because it can truly express the truth he sees in this song and the energy it gives him. The key to getting through lifeâs challenges is loving yourself, then onto the rest of the world.   A fight breaks out and it seems like a meta moment where Kendrick directly addresses the listener. NEGUS. I think heâs trying to say nobody is a nigga or nigger. Weâre NEGUSES and KINGS from birth, butterflies from our wombs and cocoons. Weâre born with infinite potential and anyone is capable of capturing it and becoming just as influential as Kendrick Lamar.   Mortal Man  Kendrick compares himself to Nelson Mandela as the leader of an army towards unity. He asks you if it gets difficult, will you still be there by his side? Heâs asking us if weâll be there every step of the way. Through court cases, a entire hip hop industry, through death threats, and hardship. He wants to be our Nelson Mandela, to help free ourselves from being slaves in our own minds. Sure, you can say his song is more than a song, but he asks us if weâll truly be on his side all the way. âWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?â Kendrick wants to be loved like Nelson Mandela and doesnât want to be betrayed like how MLK, JFK, and Michael Jackson were.   âI remember you was conflicted. Misusing your influence. Sometimes I did the same. Abusing my power full of resentment. Resentment that turned into a deep depression. Found myself screaming in a hotel room. I didnât wanna self destruct. The evils of Lucy was all around me. So I went running for answers. Until I came home. But that didnât stop survivorâs guilt. Going back and forth. Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned. Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was. But while my loved ones was fighting. A continuous war back in the city. I was entering a new one. A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination. Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned. The word was respect. Just because you wore a different gang color than mineâs. Doesnât mean I canât respect you as a black man. Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets. If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us. But I donât know, Iâm no mortal man, maybe Iâm just another nigga.â   Tupac and Kendrick Lamar speak to each other and /u/Jahoy_hoy noticed this:   ""I was kinda feeling that the boy who Kendrick meets in the third verse of Momma might be a reflection of young Kendrick's relationship with Tupac. Just like Pac influenced Kendrick as a kid, this boy is influenced by Kendrick's own music and messages. He's even said to resemble Kendrick's features, adding to the comparisons between him and young Kendrick. I wonder if Kendrick sees Pac as someone who achieved that ""butterfly"" status.""  Iâd say so. Kendrick sees Tupac as a butterfly who stood true to himself and stayed beautiful throughout it all. Kendrickâs friendâs poem was a great way to end this album.   âThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him He can no longer see past his own thoughts Heâs trapped When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city The result? Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same.â  And goddamn, does that ending hit me hard. âPacâ¦Pacâ¦Pacâ¦"" I know my thoughts have been disjointed and that Iâve missed things, but I hope you all can help with any insight.   This album did something to me, something I canât describe. For many years, Iâve struggled with severe depression and by these last few months Iâve felt so numb to the world around me. I didnât care about getting up out of bed, hell, most days I would want to sleep forever. I became a shell of myself and that curious, 10 year old kid who would want to learn about everything and anything. Iâve lost touch with my emotions and myself through isolation and intruding thoughts of failures or regrets. Lately Iâve been thinking about suicide more often and disappearing to escape all my pain. I listened to this album yesterday and I felt so alive from it. I really donât know, but To Pimp a Butterfly sparked this feeling inside me that is screaming at me to live and succeed. Iâm fucking crying right now because Kendrick Lamar has honestly saved my life. I was thinking of killing myself soon. Iâve felt so much failure in everything Iâve done, but we all fuck up. We all go through depressions and regret, but I donât want to be numb anymore. I want to fucking live. I want to create beautiful pieces of music and meet strangers and create stories and adventures Iâll cherish until whenever I die. I donât want to soak in my sorrow. Itâs as if this album breathed life into me again. I feel like a little kid again. It doesnât end here for me and if Kendrick ever comes across this post, I hope he sees that the sincerity of his message has truly saved someoneâs life.   Thank you for reading."
KendrickLamar,2zes9f,dalive,7,Tue Mar 17 23:45:26 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot man this is truly amazing I hope you realize loving yourself is loving everyone else and sky is the limit for you buddy. Reading this made me cry my eyes out and I'm just happy Kendrick saved your life with this beautiful piece of artwork. To me this is hands down one of the best albums ever not just rap but as far as rap goes this is going to be one of the most influential rap albums. Thank you Kendrick. Thank you also hope only the best for you.
KendrickLamar,2zes9f,Dawknight316,4,Wed Mar 18 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate that friend. And ""loving yourself is loving everyone else,"" isn't that from a particular school of thought or philosophy? I swear, it sounds really familiar or something a teacher told me before.   And thanks again :) I'm happy I've found something that's pushed me where I needed it.   I think this album will go down in history and I think Kendrick was right when he said that ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" will be taught in college courses."
KendrickLamar,2zes9f,Googen_,6,Wed Mar 18 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This is a beautifully done interpretation of an incredible album and story.  It amazes me how this album can be so dark and yet leave me feeling so hopeful. Makes me want to start living my life meaningfully instead of letting it drift by.    Also, the 2pac part gives me chills every time..."
KendrickLamar,2zes9f,inb4deth,4,Wed Mar 18 03:19:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you friend, I truly appreciate it. Yeah as I listened I was really caught off guard by how dark it got, but amazed by the end. I think Kendrick tries to use parallels a lot in this album to get across his optimism for ""u"" and ""i"" or rather people to join together. The Tupac part hit me HARD. I got some big chills from that."

I felt a lot of the same things as you, about the album insights, depression & numbness, losing who you were as a child, and most importantly the fact this album has ""sparked this feeling inside me that is screaming at me to live and succeed.""  During my first listen, when the For Sale transitioned to Momma and the beat dropped, I smiled so big. I will never forget that feeling I had inside. The only way I could describe this feeling is, feeling like I've finally went back home. Thanks for linking me to your post. Best of luck to you, your life and your art."

Pain and struggle.. Depression. I believe these hardships are constructs intended to induce progression. These situations that have or will happen are a part of a natural cycle that exists within all of us for emotional, spiritual, and intellectual betterment. It's amazing that this album contributed to your paradigm shift and essentially woke you from your crisis. Hopefully it impacts many more.   What type of music do you create?"
KendrickLamar,2zes9f,LanoverHD,0,Wed Mar 18 11:59:04 2015 UTC,"You don't know how much this means to me, thanks friend. Yeah I'd agree, kinda like a cycle. I'll get better. I'm looking optimistic for the future. I make beats, awful ones though hahaha. Sometimes I'll write some songs with my acoustic guitar and I planned this rap album, but I need more experience. I don't know what I'm doing, I need to make more and more until I find a direction and style that is true to myself."
KendrickLamar,2zes9f,relativelyhappy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:34:20 2015 UTC,"I was on the verge of tears reading your post on the train in the morning. You messaged me yesterday and suggested I check this out after replying to my comment. I'm glad I did. It may be a cliche, but this is bigger than music. This is where the phrase, ""this is bigger than rap"", comes from. Kendrick created a piece of art that captures thoughts and emotions that are rarely expressed. Thoughts that are seldom spoken or heard. Emotions that are felt but are stifled by what society expects of us. What this album captures, to me, is the essence of life. Guilt, shame, confidence, self-affirmation, reverence, love, reassurance. I don't know many albums, let alone rap albums, that can do this. The only album that comes to mind is Illmatic.  When music has the ability to move someone in such a way that they can appreciate and value life more, it crosses a boundary that makes it far more important than something you can simply dance or vibe to. Sonic art is what it is, and to hear that TPAB moved you to that point is inspiring and brings so much more value to the album for me.   I too have experienced severe depression, and it's a pain I didn't know if I'd ever escape. The complete shame you feel for trying to smile at a moment you know is happy, but can't feel is happy is a painful existence. Glad you've seen the light and can build from there. It can only get better from here right? God bless you, spread those wings and be free."

KendrickLamar,2zej0y,gAlienLifeform,2,Wed Mar 18 06:40:39 2015 UTC,"Buy a copy on the tour, or get a physical copy"
KendrickLamar,2zej0y,Twisted_Lobster,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"In the gaming industry buying a digital copy gets the developer more money. So I would assume the Digital TPAB would get Kendrick more money than if you buy the physical copy since they have to cover the cost of printing the CD, Case, Booklet, and Distributing Fees. If you mean which Online disturber (Amazon, iTunes etc.) will give him more, it's all probably more or less the same."
KendrickLamar,2ze286,roadislong,14,Tue Mar 17 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Kendrick sent a message through TPaB that analyzing his work is exactly he wants people to do. He's taken away the bangers on this album because people just jam to them even considering them lyrically. He's gone in a completely different direction musically so that people will listen to his words. The scrambled Braille message on the digital booklet; people need to feel it and decipher it. That's a message on the album. He wants us to piece together the puzzle he has created for us, he wants us to really feel what he's saying. There's many examples of this sentiment throughout the album. But just because there aren't bangers on this new work doesn't mean that it's not music that you can still enjoy."
KendrickLamar,2ze286,PM-ME-UR-ART,10,Tue Mar 17 21:03:40 2015 UTC,I feel like the reason why people are complaining about there being no bangers is because of the lack of variety in regard to sound and musicality in the game today. People grow accustomed to something so they don't necessarily understand or like originality when it comes up.
KendrickLamar,2ze286,CozzyZ,3,Tue Mar 17 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"At least we know that in twenty years, Kendrick's work will be regarded unlike some of the stupid shit we hear now a days.   ""If your message aint shit, fuck the records you sold"" - Immortal Technique"

KendrickLamar,2zev31,timbobimbo,3,Wed Mar 18 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"The album cover: I think Kendrick's overall message of TPaB is that he wishes to unite society. There are a lot of references in each song to the idea of contrast in unity, contrast in integration. On the album cover there's a lot too.The Black community at the White house, a Black and White image, Black earth on the bottom and a White sky up top, all of this being surrounded by a gray border(a mixture, a unity, of Black and White) that could very well be the walls/cocoon around the whole album.    The thank you page: He thanks God and his family. That's all pretty self-explanatory, with the impact that Kendrick always says they have had on him, his life, and his career. The pt. 2 is interesting. There are a lot of references to the number 2 on this album. Within the songs, there are so many instances that he mentions the number in one way or another, I'm not going to use all of my time and the space in this post to list them all. 2Pac can serve as another reference to the number. 2 babies on the cover for The Blacker the Berry. 2 gangbangers on the cover of i. The songs on the album come in pairs of contrast, each song has another on the album that counters it; pairs, 2. On this thank you page, pt. 2 is yet another reference. It's also boxed in, giving it extra emphasis, but it's boxed in using the Roman numeral for 2. I think this all this pt. 2 business is referring to Kendrick being the second savior of hip hop, of the black community. The first coming of the savior was Tupac. Kendrick is the second coming. Through TPaB, he expresses how he had thought he was doing so much for his city, for his people. He finally comes back to Compton only to see that he had been neglecting them. He falls into a great depression, crucifies himself over this album, and hopes that he can now be the leader/savior that he knows he can be and that the people deserve. As for the message, it's Braille; it's what blind people use to read. Kendrick sent his listeners a message in this new album that he really wants you to feel and decipher his words so you can see what he's saying through his music. He wants people to really analyze it so that they can find meaning in the content. This scrambled message is on the digital booklet. It's a message on the album. Once you translate it from Braille to the traditional alphabet, you also have to unscramble the words to form his message. Kendrick wants his listeners to piece together the puzzle he has created for us, he wants us to really feel and decipher it(Braille), in order to see what he's saying. A blank letter by Kendrick Lamar. Also, the physical copy of the album on CD has the title in Braille on it. Same thing here: blind people can't see, Kendrick wants his listeners to read into the album, to feel it, to see what its message is."
KendrickLamar,2zev31,PM-ME-UR-ART,3,Wed Mar 18 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting, I see the many instances of 2. u+ i, for free, for sale. I didn't make the connection to 2pac. I still don't understand the order of the Braille. It's specifically , ""A Kendrick by Lamar blank letter"" besides what you say, unscramble the message of the album."
KendrickLamar,2zev31,PM-ME-UR-ART,2,Wed Mar 18 00:49:13 2015 UTC,"The fact that he scrambled it is the meaning to be found, in itself. Kendrick enjoys creating puzzles of meaning and thought, which all of his albums have certainly been. TPaB is another message, another puzzle that Kendrick created, scrambled up, and he has us put it together for ourselves. This is exactly what every literary genius or great writer has done in their narratives. They create a single, meaningful message, break it up, hide the pieces across the pages of their stories, and watch you find them, hoping you'll be able to see them all and put them all together, painting their masterpiece. Kendrick does exactly this on each of his albums, although TPaB takes it up just 1 level. That's the purpose of having the Braille message scrambled up. He's putting a message on the album to convey to his listener just what he is doing through his album. Hope this helps."

So it's not something that was released with the album, probably something that people are bringing up because of how perfectly it goes with TPaB, and now everyone thinks it came out with the album. But the fact it didn't doesn't take away from the meaning it holds and great parallels it has to TPaB. Tupac passes the torch on to Kendrick. They are the first and second saviors/kings of hip hop and for the people; absolutely."

KendrickLamar,2zd7r9,abattleofone,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:55:28 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that kendrick is trying to make it so that there is no longer any ""radio friendly"" music anymore. It's all just music."
KendrickLamar,2zd7r9,GB_Neji,6,Sun Mar 22 22:00:30 2015 UTC,I definitely feel like King Kunta will be the next single. Very upbeat and catchy.
KendrickLamar,2zcnla,PM-ME-UR-ART,3,Tue Mar 17 14:06:31 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely sure that Kendrick thinks this is his most important album to date. And he's trying to the world that he IS, and I agree, the king of the hip hop industry. I also heard in the album that he wants to unite the people, particularly black people (ferguson), and he wants his album to reach millions. He was even quoted to saying that he truly believes that ""To pimp a butterfly"" will become a household phrase. He aimed really HIGH with his third major album and it's not about whether the bangers are bangers or if it's too chill or if there's too much skits, he has been trying to create a piece of music that will affect an entire generation of people, but he says that a dream is only a dream when you don't put the work in. This leads me to believe Kendrick might do something drastic to unite people or something. Because if he just releases the album and spends the next year doing shows and making more music, then he's a hypocrite to his own words. I think kendrick's got a plan, but we'll see in the future. If he claims to bring an army to unite, he needs to back it up. Other than that, I think he and his team have created the most perfect album I've ever listened to and this is spanning hundreds and hundreds of albums. I've never heard something that hit me so hard and I think when people give the album a chance to talk, they'll hear and truly listen. The future will tell what's next and I'm optimistic."
KendrickLamar,2zcnla,Peeners,2,Tue Mar 17 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"I also heard in the album that he wants to unite the people, particularly black people (ferguson), and he wants his album to reach millions.     That message is certainly there on the album, but I think the overall message is that he wishes to unite society. There are a lot of references to the idea of contrast in unity, contrast in integration.   The album cover: the Black community at the White house, a Black and White image, Black earth on the bottom and a White sky up top, all of this being surrounded by a gray border(a mixture, a unity, of Black and White) that could very well be the walls/cocoon around the whole album.  The musical side of the album: On TPaB, Kendrick combines Black and White in so many ways. Just another example of this is the music and instrumental pieces his lyrics travel through. He combines smooth jazz and rap; he combines that which is typically thought of as old White people music and the rap that is descriptive of the Black community.  Paired songs on the album: The album is a seamless, single story being told. Kendrick doesn't leave time space in between the end of one song and the beginning of the next, they flow and bleed right into each other, it's one united and integrated narrative. But within this singularity, Kendrick has made pairs of songs that directly contrast each other. For Free? & For Sale? Institutionalized & Alright Wesley's Theory & King Kunta Momma & You Ain't Gotta Lie (Momma Said) Hood Politics & How Much a Dollar Cost Complexion (A Zulu Love) & The Blacker the Berry These Walls & Mortal Man u & i Kendrick created pairs of contrasting songs on a single, unified, and integrated album. This is his goal for society. The stand-out pair of these 8 different juxtapositions is u & i. They're the only titles left uncapitalized, and have the greatest contrast of all the pairs; in terms of content, instrumentals, and emotion delivered to the listener. Kendrick emphasizes this pair in particular as it is one  of the main messages of the entire album: he wants to unite you and I, to bring everyone in society together, for you and I to bring others together. On this album, he also speaks on unifying the contrast inside the Black community (opposing gangs, light skins and dark skins, etc.) He seeks to mend the differences that the Black community has created among itself, and have them realize how they are all the same people. He also speaks on then uniting the Black community and the rest of society, namely the White community, as we are all the same people.     This leads me to believe Kendrick might do something drastic to unite people or something.    I think kendrick's got a plan, but we'll see in the future. If he claims to bring an army to unite, he needs to back it up.     This album is that drastic something. His plan is to unite society, through music, as it's all we have left. The army he's bringing together is made up of each and every one of us in society; and he certainly backs it up through this album.      I've never heard something that hit me so hard and I think when people give the album a chance to talk, they'll hear and truly listen. The future will tell what's next and I'm optimistic.     That's the hope.    Edit: Threw some more stuff in. It's absolutely amazing just how much work Kendrick puts into everything he does."
KendrickLamar,2zcnla,Peeners,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"Right on the nail. You're absolutely right, he wants to unite us all, but I think the ferguson reference is purposely trying to show the audience he's speaking directly to them. And the album artwork comment, I think that's so true. He's removing the distinction of color (even if they're mostly black on the cover) to show that racial differences aren't affecting his message.   WOOOOOW even the the two's come into play with the titles. Tupac and Kendrick. Paired songs. References to the number two. There's got to be more to it I hope.   He wants to bring opposites and communities together.   Man I love the analysis you've brought to my attention, thanks very much. I'll be updating my original post for the second half so check my post history later today and I'll put a link on all those comments/posts to my completed thoughts."

Through TPaB, he expresses how he had thought he was doing so much for his city, for his people. He finally comes back to Compton only to see that he had been neglecting them. He falls into a great depression, crucifies himself over this album, and hopes that he can now be the leader/savior that he knows he can be and that the people deserve.    Hope this helps."

KendrickLamar,2z9x5r,gidsterooski,7,Mon Mar 16 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean. You can look at the album a number of ways, obviously the main intention is about race, but it's also a literary work of sorts, so recurring themes, foreshadowing, etc, are all also important. If you read To Kill a Mockingbird, yeah it's about rape and racism and inequality but it's also worth talking about the symbolism of the mad dog, even of the phrase ""to kill a mockingbird"" itself, the fact that the theme of the book is ""lost innocence."" This is just something like that. A recurring theme that I think was purposeful, that maybe we can find a meaning in, as well as the meaning of the racial themes."

KendrickLamar,2z9x5r,DikembeNONONO,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:40:47 2015 UTC,Nope. Section 80 wasn't considered his debut studio album. GKMC was his introduction into the mainstream world. S80 ws obviously album-caliber but it wasn't distributed the way GKMC was.
KendrickLamar,2z9x5r,PM-ME-UR-ART,3,Sun Mar 22 06:49:34 2015 UTC,"A great way of thinking. You're what's right with hip hop. There is meaning in it, there's meaning behind each and every second of this album, and it's important for you to decide for yourself just what that meaning is. And if you get a little lost in the complexities of it, it's ok to get a kickstart on your analysis by reaching out on here."
KendrickLamar,2z9x5r,PM-ME-UR-ART,3,Tue Mar 17 14:12:01 2015 UTC,"You caution him to analyze Kendrick's work? Kendrick sent a message through this album that doing so is exactly he wants people to do. He's taken away the bangers on this album that people just jam to without even considering it lyrically. He's gone in a completely different direction musically so that people will listen to his words. The scrambled Braille message on the digital booklet; people need to feel it and decipher it. That's a message on the album. There's many other examples, and I honestly just don't feel like typing them out, but don't tell someone not to analyze his work. If you do, Kendrick is telling you that you're what's wrong with hip hop."
KendrickLamar,2z9x5r,Peeners,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"You never know. Kendrick and his team spent A LOT of time creating the album and would you really think that he wouldn't put it little subtleties like these? He knows exactly what he was going for and I've already found things people have missed. I think this OP here has a good point and that 2 is referenced a lot in the album. It could be alluding to Pac and Kendrick, but there could be more. I also heard a verse that said to play the first verse in one of the songs in reverse, which I found a little weird but I haven't done it yet"

Kendrick and his team spent A LOT of time creating the album and would you really think that he wouldn't put it little subtleties like these?     I know they would and I know they did. I'm not sure where you got that sentiment from in my comment, did you mean to comment to the person above mine?     It could be alluding to Pac and Kendrick, but there could be more     Absolutely. There is long-thought-out meaning behind every word on the album and it's important for you to decide for yourself what you find that meaning to be.    As for that line you referenced, it was something like So when you listen to this song go back and rewind the first verse. When you go back to verse 1, and read it from the last line to first, it produces another parallel, coherent, and meaningful storyline of how the walls/room and Kendrick interact, compare, and correlate. There are many similar instances of hidden meaning that he sometimes points out like this, or sometimes doesn't and makes you find and figure it out on your own. Kendrick enjoys creating puzzles of meaning and thought, which all of his albums have certainly been; although I may argue TPaB steps up one level."

KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,khaleesHEEM,18,Mon Mar 16 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"This new version is basically like the SNL performance which I thought was pretty sick for a live performance. That being said, when I listened to it, I felt like it was just an audio recording of a live performance because of those ad-libs. It does fit the style of the album better but as a stand-alone song, the old ""i"" was better in my opinion. Performance-wise, the new one. Hopefully this makes sense."
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,eklxtreme,8,Mon Mar 16 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"I vastly prefer the old version, and I think it fit the flow of the album much better.

KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,abattleofone,9,Mon Mar 16 15:19:30 2015 UTC,old
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,dumb_darb,6,Mon Mar 16 14:26:03 2015 UTC,I love that there's two versions bc that makes the album version make sense. And I love how he executed the album version.
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,Ashurbanipal18,3,Mon Mar 16 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"I prefer the new version. The atmosphere is fucking palpable. I liked the old i, but I honestly think that would've felt too clean for an album like this. This album has a fairly consistent, dark, grimy feel to it the whole way through and I think the whole talk at the end and the whole spoken word ""negus"" thing at the end is fantastic."
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,Astrapsody,3,Mon Mar 16 20:01:44 2015 UTC,"The new version fits so much better. In the middle of 'u' we know that Kendrick is in a hotel room. Songs between that and 'i' have Kendrick accept that everything will be fine, he experiences anger, distress, acceptance and he finally goes out to a crowd to perform 'i'."
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,ToPimpAButterfinger,3,Tue Mar 17 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"The new version of i only works on the album.  If you try to take it away and stand it on its own, it's garbage.  It just doesn't work at all by itself.      Give me the full SNL performance.  That's what I want the most."
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,JohnnyBlaze416,2,Mon Mar 16 22:30:48 2015 UTC,album version by far. the hype got me out of my seat(literally lol) and when he dropped the beat and got real on those two guys fighting..and then to follow that outro with the pac outro after everything pac stood for? absolutely. album version > single version.
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,TunTunteddybear,2,Mon Mar 16 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"New, Kendrick creates his albums with a flow throughout which is far more pleasing to da ear."
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,freelands2,2,Mon Mar 16 22:26:07 2015 UTC,"The new one fits into the flow of the album much better. The live recording is  a nice resoultion to the album, like the depressed Kendrick in the hotel room manages to make it out, and jumps onstage, where he can feel great. Idk it's just how it make me feel when I heard it all the way through."
KendrickLamar,2z8dq5,ninja_pineapple,2,Tue Mar 17 00:59:48 2015 UTC,New version wins to me because it's more real then the old version.

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,navarrm,14,Mon Mar 16 08:01:53 2015 UTC,He did it again guys. Another solid album. This will go up on shelves with Section.80 and GKMC. This is another Compton Classic.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,KingBR1,12,Mon Mar 16 06:39:50 2015 UTC,"Wesleyâs Theory  âEvery nigga is a star."" Anyone can be successful, to accomplish great things. They begin in their cocoons as butterflies, slipping out onto a journey of self-realization and fighting against losing yourself to those who ""pimp"" you.   The hook takes off with Kendrick describing his love for fame and making it big at first, eventually turning into lust and then being destroyed. What was it all for anyway?  In March of 2012 Kendrick was signed onto Interscope Records and Aftermath Entertainment. He tells his characterâs perspective from how heâll be when he gets signed onto a major label, going out to clubs and âtreatinâ yo selfâ with lots of material wealth. He even wants to buy some M-16âs and pass them out in his neighborhood to take over the White House as seen from the album cover. No college and heâs gotten rich, just like that. However, although he got huge in seemingly an instant, it can also disappear just as fast.   Those who signed Kendrick could give him so much money. They are telling him he can get it all and live a lavish life, but heâs stayed true to himself. He hasnât let his greed best him and is being careful to not lose everything.   For Free  THIS DICK AINâT FREE! This girlâs going off on Kendrick because he hasnât been the âballer ass niggaâ she wants. He isnât having any of it though. Heâs got value in himself and heâs not selling out any time soon. She replies with âIâmma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up. You ainât no king.â The girl is the temptation of living like a king. Her uncle is America and Kendrick compares the relationship to blacks and this country.   King Kunta  Heâs upset because there are others who claim his crown in the hip/hop industry, but itâs his with this album (I agree). People in the industry are also trying to ""pimp him out"", but he sees right through their deceit. Those who fall into the traps of the commercialization of hip hop are âpimped outâ and sometimes get ghost writers, ultimately quieting their voice for artistic creation. These butterflies have to watch out of these kinds of people. The song ends with the beginning of Kendrickâs poem.   âI remembered you was conflicted, misusing your influence.â  Institutionalized  Your environments help mold you into the type of person youâll become. People can get âinstitutionalizedâ or being put into a certain mindset that essentially traps you like how Kendrick had the ghetto in him. He would help his mother live better, his old friends too, and just get high in the White House if he ever was president. He hasnât lost touch with his past.   Life can eat you up, but youâll always get something good for the bad events that occur to you, however, this wonât happen unless youâre making an effort to get better or become the best of yourself. A dreamâs only a dream. The reality needs the work put in. And success, whether in becoming wealthy or accomplishing oneâs dreams, can change the people around them, but it canât change the core of who they are unless they let it. Change in an individualâs life comes with proper intention and action.   Snoop calls back to when Kendrick was just a kid and his conversation with a friend at a show they went to. Kendrick doesnât understand why rappers would make it big and just spend it all out. People look up to these guys and in the meanwhile, they lose themselves.   Kendrick explains that Snoopâs verse is actually his grandmotherâs advice to him and reveals more on it. He was just a kid with potential, but still in an institutionalized mentality. He needs to remember his home and his roots to stay himself throughout it all. The institutionalization of people can be good or bad and Kendrickâs grandma reminds him to not forget his love for his family and friends.   These Walls  âI remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence. Sometimes I did the same.â   I think the song uses a double meaning for these lyrics of this song. It obviously refers to a woman, but Iâd say the walls are his soul. The very essence of his being would tell him to strive in this world. It would want him to live true to himself or else itâd be full of pain and resentment. It would tell him to go deep and explore who he is, as he has already done. His soul always is there providing help to truly see the world and around himself. But is the soul always pure?  The third verse changes the perspective as I heard the mood change and saw itâs not âthese wallsâ anymore, but rather âyour walls.â I believe it changes to the viewpoint of his own soul. Walls can talk.   The song ends with more of his poem.   âI remember you was conflicted. Misusing your influence. Sometimes I did the same. Abusing my power full of resentment. Resentment that turned into a deep depression. Found myself screaming in a hotel room.â  u  The song is about the âhotel roomâ Kendrick ended up in. He is depressed, feeling low self-esteem and a lack of confidence. Itâs taking a look at his character as if heâs an outsider watching himself and touching on some of his darkest moments in life. Itâs complicated to love yourself. Heâs felt failure, self-doubt, and most importantly, a hatred for himself and hope that heâll feel its pain. Someone from housekeeping comes by and there isnât an answer so I come to think of this as a hint to him wanting to commit suicide.  The song changes to one of Kendrickâs old friends that he left behind in his hometown. He sounds either high or drunk and angry at Kendrick for not coming back. Heâs still living a difficult life and he cries himself to sleep often. He even says Kendrick didnât visit another friend who was dying in a hospital. Instead, Kendrick facetimed his friend before he died. Heâs angry at Kendrick for not trying more to stay close with his old friends.   Alright  Kendrick sees God and his belief in a god as something that truly helps him stay hopeful and succeed. The song also brings up Lucy or the devil. Lucy wants influence on Kendrickâs soul, but Kendrick hopes that heâs still doing enough good to stay on good terms with God. He stays optimistic that heâll turn out okay and do well.   âI remember you was conflicted. Misusing your influence. Sometimes I did the same. Abusing my power full of resentment. Resentment that turned into a deep depression. Found myself screaming in a hotel room. I didnât wanna self destruct. The evils of Lucy was all around me. So I went running for answers.â  For Sale?  His soul is speaking now asking if this was what he wanted, to keep it âgangsta.â Kendrick goes on to describe Lucyâs temptation. People can easily fall into the love for Lucy. Lucy has tempted rappers through material things and greed. Kendrick compares it to signing a deal with the Devil for more success and fortune.   âI remember you was conflicted. Misusing your influence. Sometimes I did the same. Abusing my power full of resentment. Resentment that turned into a deep depression. Found myself screaming in a hotel room. I didnât wanna self destruct. The evils of Lucy was all around me. So I went running for answers. Until I came home.â"
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,owlsrule143,57,Mon Mar 16 23:31:13 2015 UTC,This album is amazing and probably the best thing to drop this year but I worry that fans of GKMC will be turned off by such a different sound.  FUCK EM!
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,crimson777,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:10:54 2015 UTC,We will see if it will be the best to drop all year. I have a feeling I'll enjoy Man on the Moon III more.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,owlsrule143,-10,Mon Mar 23 07:51:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of a lot of different genres of music, like just about every genre you could possibly name off the top of your head and more.   this album is doing nothing for me. GKMC is probably the strongest point of rap and hip hop history, blending dope ass beats, catchy riffs and choruses, really good production, passion and cohesiveness. simply put, the album was perfection.  this seems like a novelty album. the novelty of how jazzy and funky it is as well as the novelty of the politically charged lyrics and concept seem to have taken higher priority than making good songs.  i hate to say this, but i think this album is shit. i'd rather listen to miles davis, the meters, michael jackson, etc. and maad city, wiz khalifa, and juicy j.  King Kunta and The Blacker the Berry are the only memorable points of the album, and i is awful with Anna Wise singing the chorus instead of Kendrick in the early release version. totally loses the great feel that the song had, and it seemed well developed before. now it sounds like a half assed mention of the song without really putting the whole thing on the album.  this was quite honestly the biggest let down in my entire music listening career. i'm not turned off because it sounds 'different'. kendrick didn't sing a single chorus, and he is barely featured in any of the songs. this is a cover album orchestrated by kendrick."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,I_VT,13,Mon Mar 16 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"You don't think that Mortal Man, U, and Alright are memorable? Sorry, I think even the people who haven't liked the album that much still looked those. You're welcome to have your opinion, and I'm not gonna say it's the best album ever or anything, but you're giving it way less credit than it deserves.  Kendrick is all over the album... Most of it is him..."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,owlsrule143,-4,Mon Mar 16 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"Whoever does the chorus/hook of Alright sounds goofy as fuck. It would have been a good song if kendrick voiced the chorus like he does in every single song on mAAd city.   Mortal man starts ok. Just ok. And then the rest of it people only like because of the novelty of it being a mock tupac interview. Yes that's cool but doesn't make the song worth pointing out to me.   You can have a song like that at the end of a kick ass album. That's a song that you put after 8 catchy singles to add some real emotional depth.   u is incredibly disjointed and I can't even remember how it goes after 3 listens.   I don't think this album deserves any credit, so im not giving it any. Kendrick is my #1 for rap/hip hop but this album is not acceptable to me personally.   Hoping for him to redeem himself with the next one. I think this is an album that people will eventually agree is poor quality once the novelty of how 'different' it is wears off."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,crimson777,5,Mon Mar 16 23:13:24 2015 UTC,U is not meant to be easy to listen to. The song is just as uncomfortable as the subject matter it covers.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,owlsrule143,-7,Tue Mar 17 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"terrible excuse for it being a boring song. i don't care about the concept. the concept is totally fine, i have nothing against it but you have to write good songs if you're going to release an album to the public.   if it was a contrast to a catchy and memorable album, it would be plenty powerful but instead it's just flat."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,kingdiako,4,Tue Mar 17 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to all that much jazz, so far all I know it could not be novel at all. But it's amazing. Fun to listen to, cool music, great lyrics with great messages, it's just overall great. I'm on my 5th listen also, so it's not like I haven't been through it multiple times. Sorry, you're in the minority, everyone I know personally loves it, and almost everyone on the internet loves it too. He doesn't need to redeem himself in anyone but your eyes, so don't ask for redemption for us. He also doesn't really care what's acceptable to you either, so thank goodness for that."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,owlsrule143,-10,Mon Mar 16 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people agree with me. This album sounds like it's pretending to be in the 70's. Reminds me of Lady Gaga's collaboration with Tony Bennett doing swing music.   Yes it's very cool and shows musical talent but it's not a real lady Gaga major album.   The difference is, kendrick is pushing this as his new big album. I'm not seeing it.   I only said it's not acceptable to me as the newest kendrick release. There just isn't much of value to me in this album. It just ropes you in with the novelty of how radically different and cool it sounds, without actually being memorable and classic.   I am not the only one."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,kingdiako,2,Mon Mar 16 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"You sir, are out of your mind. So please enough with your blasphemous opinion."

SORRY YES HAIL KENDRICK I SUBMIT TO HIS AUTHORITY!"
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,crimson777,2,Sun Mar 22 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"No, I was being serious. Your critiques of this masterpiece are indeed, blasphemous. You say it doesn't have ""dope ass"" beats and choruses like GKMC. That is not what GKMC or TPaB are for. They're not made to make you ""turn up"". They're made so you can listen to the lyrics and the message that is being put across by Kendrick. At the end of the day you are entitled to your opinion. On the other hand, I just think it's utterly blasphemous."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,CKsquid,0,Sun Mar 22 23:17:21 2015 UTC,"as of today, a lot of it has grown on me. to be clear, my criticism isn't about turning up, it's about making really good memorable songs that stand on their own outside of the context of the album.   a lot of the songs have grown on me and they sound great, but theres still some sense that the album isn't quite as high quality musically as maad city i guess. i do understand now that they are meant to provide a lot of empty space for you to focus on the message within the lyrics, and i am beginning to appreciate that more.   I dont consider this a masterpiece. it's far too imperfect to be such but i think it is noteworthy artwork and has an important message.   maad city was a masterpiece."

King Kunta gets me groovin every time, same with the blacker the berry. the new version of i should have been a bonus track on the deluxe edition, and the actual studio recorded version should be on the album.

Then that first beat hit and I jumped out my seat. This album is funky as hell & the lyrics are poetic yes but they are highlighted by the great production throughout the album. Have you listened to section 80? Some of the tracks on this remind me of that with the jazzy feel and chill vibes. I think you went in(and Im of course guessing here) expecting hot singles like on GKMC. But that is not what this album is about. I dont think kendrick gives a fuck about radio. He knew millions of people would listen to his new project so he used that position to do and say something important. Something that needed to be said. And, in my opinion, he did it with the best possible execution from the beats to the lyrics to the overall structure and meaning of the album. The concept is dope and not easily digestible. Kendrick easily could've made a second GKMC with the same lyrics and more mainstream beats and people would've lauded it. I for one appreciate the artistry and gumption for experimentation in music. Kendrick will be remembered for a very long time for this album. Essays will be written about the deeper meaning behind the concept and how relevant it is to our society today. Anyways, if you didn't dig it, that's on you. Not judging or hating but are you white? Cuz most white ppl my age Ive talked to that only listened to GKMC said they didnt like it either. But colored ppl Ive talked to LOVE it. Like off the walls are in fucking love with this album. Something about bringing that funk back into hip hop and being socially conscious about race issues of today at the same time is very appealing.   BTW how did you feel King Kunta and not Wesleys theory? or Alright, Hood Politics, These Walls?   Regarding i, this shit on the album sounded like a fucking block party or a rally or something it was amazing. If you wanna listen to studio i, go for it. I feel like that's just nitpicking at a small issue. I like studio i too, but in the context and flow of this album, the live i sounds so much more urgent and necessary than studio i.   I feel like people these days have one of two opinions on things; they either LOVE it or think its trash. Why can't there be any middle ground anymore? I feel like fans of Kendrick would love this album cuz it represents everything he's about. From the experimentation to the great beats and lyrics, this album was EASILY one of my favorites of this year  (even tho its march)"
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,kingdiako,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:07:29 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you here
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,owlsrule143,-2,Wed Mar 18 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"i doubt we have particularly different taste in music. i don't think it's unreasonable to expect singles like GKMC, but even if that is unreasonable, i don't think it's unreasonable to expect memorable songs that are clearly well written and catchy, and have all of the strengths of usual kendrick without concerning whether or not they're radio friendly.   there are no hits on this album. theres a difference between singles and just generally good quality music. this album is bland and monotonous from start to finish, no variation or much interesting that stands out.   yes i know section.80, kendrick has always been jazzy and funky in section.80 and GKMC, but blended in well to the music and to his style. this is just a novelty album that tries to highlight the jazz and the funk to the point where his voice and the actual songs take a backseat and are not noticeable at all. the production is TERRIBLE. you are dead wrong about that, the production just sounds completely flat and unfinished on pretty much the entire album other than king kunta and the blacker the berry. as someone who actually records and produces music, everything is so much better mixed/mastered and produced in GKMC, to the point where all the aspects of the song stand out. mixing is an art form, and it's considered perfectly balanced when everything somehow manages to be perfectly heard while still focusing on certain aspects. absolutely terrible. this sounds like an unfinished demo scrappy barebones mix tape that is meant to be a political statement rather than a classic album in any sense.  the 'beats' are pretty straightforward and simple, as a drummer they didn't really excite me too much. nothing was carefully calculated or arranged. on money trees, listen to the first 30 seconds of that song. no bass for a bit, and then that first kick drum/bass drum hit comes in, it really just shakes your soul. it's perfect. nothing gave me that feeling on this album. it was a big mess, disorganized and sporadic, to the point of static monotonous.   how many times do i have to say this.. if he made an evolution of GKMC with the same message, meaning, and concept of this, i would have fucking loved it. why do you assume that i have to hate the idea behind the album in order to claim that the songs are SHIT?   yes I'm white. I fucking love funk. KENDRICK HAS ALWAYS BEEN FUNKY AND JAZZY. IT JUST WAS NOT BLENDED IN WELL IN THIS ALBUM AT ALL. King Kunta is very funky, i like it because it's also catchy and memorable. if you listen to GKMC again, you'll find the bass to be very funky in a lot of songs. listen to ""Good Kid"". for jazz, listen to Bitch Don't Kill my Vibe, Sing About Me, Im Dying of Thirst, The Art of Peer Pressure, and also on Section.80 ADHD. Again, I find it absurd to call an album good music because it is ""socially conscious"". do you not understand how absurd that kind of statement is?   Wesley's theory wasn't catchy and had no edge. it didn't get under my skin. it sounded very drab and boring musically. again, the novelty of how funky the bass is is not enough for me to call it a great Kendrick Lamar song.   Alright I have said elsewhere I find the chorus with some goofy as dude saying ""we gonna be alrrright"" to just sound stupid like Tony the Tiger or something. frosted flakes, they're grrrreat. it's also my #1 complaint of the album: not a single song features Kendrick singing/voicing the hook/chorus of a song. I actually think the song has some potential to be pretty good but that completely ruins it and makes it not a Kendrick Lamar song.   Hood Politics is just boring and doesn't go anywhere or have any real sound to it. it's a straight beat with pretty much spoken word rapping and not much else besides saying ""boo-boo"". when the setlist for the album was announced, I saw ""Hood Politics"" and thought damn this is gonna be a sick song. nah, not so much. totally forgettable and I find it ridiculous that it made it onto a released album as a ""song"".   These Walls is the only song that is sorta growing on me a little bit, mostly because I'm pretty sure it's a cover. on the tip of my tongue but it's identical to some other song. not original at all. still no Kendrick chorus, might as well be a funky cover. it sounds pretty good and is moderately catchy but would only fit in if there were at least like 6-7 good Kendrick Lamar songs for it to be a contrast with. like ""Real"" on GKMC. it has Anna Wise singing the chorus, so it's interesting after an album of all kendrick. are you going to try to tell me that the one good song on an album that makes it a ""good"" album is the one that doesn't even feature Kendrick? nope.   as for i... the version on this album is pitifully ruined. from the live unproduced and mixed vocals, to Anna Wise doing the chorus (would have been the only song with kendrick doing a chorus.. but for some reason he fucked that up. sounds completely wrong and not as edgy), and cutting off the last half of the song for a spoken word and a cappella ""bloc party"" skit, the song is complete trash and does not deserve a place on a STUDIO ALBUM. it's the kind of thing that should be a bonus track on the deluxe edition. the original song was incredibly well produced, constructed, arranged, mixed, and generally catchy and awesome sounding. funky bass, nice sample of a classic funk song, and the bridge and the ending have some sick beats. great song thrown out the window again in favor of the concept of socially conscious and all that shit. he actively avoided putting a great song on this album. thats telling.   dont stereotype me either. i can think something is just ok, but this album I just think is trash. why would I compromise and say it's just ok? theres nothing of value to me on it. in terms of concept and message, 10/10, in terms of the actual songs, 2/10. that doesn't make it an ""ok"" album on average. it makes it a terrible album that is aiming at some sort of social awareness and fails to do so because nobody will listen to it without good songs.   lyrics weren't very memorable either, nothing really catchy except for ""I've got a BOOOONE to pick"" and ""burn baby burn"".  oh, you know what else i remember to the point where i could probably recite it from memory because he never shuts up about it? his poem, ""I remember you was conflicted. misusing your influence....""  I get it. it's a poem. it's referenced and built upon throughout the album. i get it. it's just annoying and way overdone though after a while, and takes up way too much of the album. I could see it being done on maybe two songs, and then in full for the ending song, which was a cool concept, interviewing Tupac, socially conscious and all that, but again the song isn't a song.. you can only do a song like that if you've got an album full of catchy great music.   let me put it this way: this album is terrible compared to jazz and funk of the eras that he was inspired by, because it sounds exactly the same stylistically but the songs aren't as good or classic. what makes you think that bringing funk and jazz into 2015 is somehow unique and worthy of overlooking the quality of the actual songs?  /endrant. I was so pumped for this album and it majorly let me down, so damn right I'm going to be pissed."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,RAVENS17d,3,Wed Mar 18 20:54:31 2015 UTC,So you're hate for this album is because it isn't catchy? Or ear friendly? Listen to the fucking lyrics dude. If you want catchy music go listen to drake or big Sean.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,iKhuu,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"first of all, i don't appreciate the ""GO LISTEN TO SOME SHITTY MUSIC IF YOU DONT LIEK THIS"" attitude, because first of all i enjoy Drake and I don't think it's fair to suggest another artist in such a manner when instead you could suggest this very same artist's previous album. you are essentially saying I'm not a fan because i think for myself and don't accept this new album just because it's him. i have real complaints about it, not just ""wow kendrick aint good"".  second, my opinion has changed on the album, a lot of it has grown on me. there are at least 5 or 6 songs that just don't do anything for me at all, and i still find the album to have a lot of wasted space and imperfections, but a lot of it i am really liking, and yes obviously i appreciate the lyrics.  which brings me to my last point: although I am starting to like the album, do not ever fucking tell me ""just listen to the lyrics"". if an album is legitimately shit music but has good lyrics, do not try to fucking tell me it's good music because the lyrics are good. you can't make up for crap music by citing the meaning behind a song. that being said, the music is very good on a little more than half of the album, and the lyrics are definitely great.   overall I don't think this album is quite as perfect and complete as maad city but kendrick's talent definitely shines through and some of the album is very good."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,theultimatetrol,22,Mon Mar 23 21:02:59 2015 UTC,At this point I want to hear Kendrick drop a country album. He proved to me that he can pretty much take any music style and kill it
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,bruins4777,27,Mon Mar 16 05:39:44 2015 UTC,"Album had to grow on me. At first, I was like ""eh"" but as of right now, my opinion has made a complete 180. This is an amazing album, and give it time, it surely will be seen as great as GKMC is.  I'm sure no one cares for my opinion on the songs, but I wrote these while listening to the whole album:  [8.5/10] 01 Wesley's Theory (ft. George Clinton & Thundercat)   [4 6/10] 02 For Free? (Interlude) Too much noise for me, might have to grow on me  [9/10] 03 King Kunta  [6 7/10] 04 Institutionalized (ft. Bilal, Anna Wise & Snoop Dogg) Chill, but kinda boring with a basic flow, imo. I'm sure it'll grow on me.  [7 7.5/10] 05 These Walls (ft. Bilal, Anna Wise & Snoop Dogg) Good lyrics, hook could use some work, interesting/dark last verse.  [7.5/10] 06 U .5 rating added for the message, expected a darker beat because of the subject manner, but this isn't GKMC.  [7.5/10] 07 Alright The song was Alright  [6/10] 08 For Sale? (Interlude) Couldn't get into the flow, beat. However had an interesting message.  [8/10] 09 Momma  [7.5/10] 10 Hood Politics  [10/10] 11 How Much A Dollar Cost (ft. James Fauntleroy & Ronald Isley) 2nd best track on the album for me  [9/10] 12 Complexion (A Zulu Love) (ft. Rapsody)  [10/10] 13 The Blacker The Berry Actually, after listening to the album, this song is one of the better ones/grew on me  [9/10] 14 You Ain't Gotta Lie (Momma Said)  [9/10] 15 i (Video Version)  [10/10] 15 i (Album Version) That acapella at the end killed it!  [11/10] 16 Mortal Man Honestly, no better way to end the album. Track was amazing, beat/lyrics were amazing, and most of all, that outro...... left me speechless. Was that interview ever aired in the past? Cuz damn... the way K. Dot made it seem like a conversation, god damn..  I guess I was going into TPAB hoping for a GKMC-style, dark album. I believe that that was my mistake. This is its own album, and it definitely is up there with GKMC, in its own right.  10/10 album.  11/10 with rice.  Edit: Sorry for the huge post lol, feel free to remove this if needed.  Edit2: This is just my opinion on the tracks, they're constantly changing, but, for those who don't want to listen to the whole album can check some of the ones I recommended and see if they click. Also, /u/bruins4777 brings up a good point, evaluating the album individually is a whole different thing than evaluating it as a whole."

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,GhengisSwan,8,Mon Mar 16 19:36:27 2015 UTC,This album is yet another 'experience' that will challenge you to revisit more than once. The first listen to me was more about the sound. The second and third listens (when you get there) will be more about the lyrical content. After that they'll both go one in the same. I think it's another masterpiece; carefully handcrafted and released at the right moment.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,KingBR1,16,Mon Mar 16 06:21:42 2015 UTC,"This album, from start to finish, is a straight up masterpiece. No better way to put it.  Kendrick deserves to be no lesser than the King of modern rap. Kind of fitting that the album continually references Pac.  This is not easy listening bangers, this is not a mediocre album that has some good beats and a few decent rhymes, this IS one of the greatest rap albums of all time. Compiled of new/modern experimental beats and lines from a poet that really force us to listen, listen, and listen again to take in all of the messages that are so relative to us as people living on this earth, be it issues of race, poverty, class conflict or how we as people look at life.  King Kendrick deserves the utmost best from this masterpiece of musical art, and we need to realize how lucky we are that Kendrick is around."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,TheRittyl,3,Mon Mar 16 12:08:47 2015 UTC,"It's a bit soon to start throwing around the ""one of the greatest rap albums of all time"" title imo."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,mr_jiffy,3,Tue Mar 17 05:56:51 2015 UTC,"maybe, but i have listened to it start to finish like 10 times, so its not just after one playthrough. I'm pretty interested in how it will do numbers wise and ratings. Have you got a favourite track/verse?"
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,mr_jiffy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 07:31:58 2015 UTC,"Still need to do a complete listen through to be honest, but I'll get back to you with it.

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,zack10house,8,Mon Mar 16 06:06:08 2015 UTC,Drake better bring his A+ game with his next album because King Kendrick just shitted on the whole rap game...again.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,yellowd73,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"Kendrick is really the only rapper out now that I see as an artist when it comes to making music. There are rappers out there that can rap good on a beat, but when comes together it's just a song. Kendrick makes songs that paint a picture. He makes albums that tell a story. Drake makes good songs, he's a good rapper, a good singer, but his subject matter isn't anything to talk about. He's a safe rapper. So I can't really give you any good songs to listen to that will change your opinion on him. Maybe look up his old songs. I just can't think of any at the time."

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,whee-ooh-whee-ooh,7,Mon Mar 16 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"Apologies in advance for the long post but I just finished the album and need to get this off my chest. So yeah..just finished the album, going over a few tracks that really stood out. Personal favorites: King Kunta, These Walls, Alright, For Sale, Hood Politics, How Much A Dollar Cost, The Blacker The Berry, You Aint Gotta Lie, i(that album version tho..), and of course Mortal Man. That list will probably expand later but that's where its at after my first time through the album.  Not really into track by track reviews but god damn...this might just be Kendrick's magnum opus. I remember when I first listened to King Kunta, that little worded piece at the end had really peaked my interest. The way it extends through every track, and then culminates with that brilliant interview with Tupac, is something I didn't see coming whatsoever. To think of something that incredible, and then to pull it off the way he did, is nothing short of brilliant. The combination of Kendrick and Pac's vocals to make the interview seem so real, and authentic is going to be something that stands out for decades and years to come. But past the outro, I'm really praying that after hearing this album, there's a resurgence of that old school funk in mainstream music again. Kendrick sounds so comfortable and at home over these kind of instrumentals, it's no wonder the west coast OGs passed him the torch. The production is so clear, and so solid, you feel like you're right there with him in the studio. With a message this raw and deep, hes clearly continuing to follow in Pac's footsteps by exposing the overlooked side of society. He knows where he came from, and he's doing nothing to hide it. I've been waiting for this album ever since GKMC was released, and now that it's here, I couldnt be happier to say that he delivered. 11/10. XXL. all that shit."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,divine3fury,7,Mon Mar 16 12:04:22 2015 UTC,"At the end of Mortal Man I kind of Teared up, Once you realize Kendrick was kind of talking to himself because Pac has been dead, Kendrick is really (In a story sense) Pac's voice because Kendrick is the only rapper today that can match Pac's Caliber and Skill, Kendrick was imagining the whole interview and then after the quote/speech I think Kendrick understands how independent and different his messages are, Than most rappers today...To keep a long story short Kendrick depended on Pac for Inspiration on the album just to realize that he's Pac's Inner voice   That's how I see it at least"
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,divine3fury,2,Mon Mar 16 20:20:02 2015 UTC,"Perfectly said, I completely agree."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,OriginalWake,5,Wed Mar 18 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"Once I realised what kind of album it was (or rather, wasn't) going to be by about five or six songs in, I started to really feel it. kdot is an incredible storyteller, and even more so than that, he has an incredible ability to let you into his headspace with his music, whether it be on the grand scale of racism or an intimate story of self-loathing.  That 'conversation' with Pac on the closer was what put it over the top; a great finish for a great album. I knew he was getting at something with those snippets of his poem at the end of each song but I wasn't prepared for how the whole puzzle fit together so brilliantly at the end."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,becauseiliketoupvote,4,Wed Mar 18 00:55:27 2015 UTC,Is the intro beat from Hood Politics a sample from something else? I love that beat

I still like the album in general but I don't think it's ""musically"" great as a whole, I don't see myself listening alot of the tracks on their own unlike GKMC. That's an important factor for me and it has nothing to do with the album being different. People have different opinions, not everyone ""should fall in love with it the way it should be"" and that's fine."

I have a huge respect for the album as a whole and love the fact Kendrick is doing something different and original even though he could sit on his ass and sell a ton of records. I do however find the album less enjoyable to listen to compared to GKMC, there isn't as many tracks that are ""fun"" to listen on their own outside of the whole album context."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,brick-face,7,Tue Mar 17 04:15:43 2015 UTC,"Alright so after listening to the album I have about a million thoughts running through my head.  First off, that album is one of the best albums I have heard regarding sending a message.  Kendrick is at a point in his career where almost knows his name.  He is using this to get a message out to people.  Getting a message that TPAB has to offer, to be heard by millions (possibly billions) of people is something that just has never been done before.  It is a way of spreading the word about racism that hits hard.  Next is the controversy about his first single relased, ""i"".  This song was released September 23, 2014.  Since that release we had been dying to know when the new album would drop.  We had a little bit of a chance after the information about it showing up on a false picture from Wal-Mart about it being released January 27th.  Kendrick got a lot of heat about ""i"" when he first released it.  Could it have been that he had a whole different album idea in mind and after receiving so much heat about ""i"", he decided to change the overall message to what ""i"" was representing?  This would explain why the album was delayed so much and would also explain the overall message Kendrick was trying to emit off this new album.  Lastly, I did a little bit of research and yes on March 14th, 1995 TuPac released his album Me Against the World.  We know that TuPac was one of the biggest influence on Kendrick and that he helped shape Kendrick into the rapper that he is today.  I think that this was a little it of a tribute to him.  Another thing, guess who died on March 15th, 2011? Nate Dogg.  Nate Dogg was a very good friend of both Dre and TuPac.  Could this be a coincidence? Possibly but there has to be something to this.  I have yet to really find anything about yet, but time will tell.  TL;DR, Kendrick thoughts about racism, relation to other, ""i"" controversy and album conspiracy, Kendrick relation to other rappers.  I know its a bit long but holy fuck this album.  P.S.  I posted an AMA request to get Kendrick to hopefully come on here and answer questions.  There is going to be A LOT of discussion about this album and I think it would be cool if fans could also do this.  HERE is the link to it and lets try to get Kendrick on here!"

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,lumpysweat,3,Mon Mar 16 21:33:41 2015 UTC,Ok this album is way better second listen. Hopefully it'll keep growing on me because I didn't like it too much first time (might've just been me tired as fuck lol)
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,MetallicIL,3,Tue Mar 17 07:24:20 2015 UTC,"Man, ""U"" is one powerful track."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,MiamiHeatBeat,3,Mon Mar 16 09:50:32 2015 UTC,Loved how Kendrick explained the title of the album and songs at the end of Mortal Man. He's put a lot of thought into it.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,Boss_Lightyear,3,Mon Mar 16 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"I only have one comment to this album.  ""I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence Sometimes, I did the same Abusing my power full of resentment Resentment that turned into a deep depression Found myself screaming in a hotel room""  I think this sums it up pretty much. The darkness that it depicts. But damn its a good album."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,JustusBaby,3,Mon Mar 16 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"I'm loving the album! I'm so vibing with it. Even though I still kinda not feeling few songs, I'm sure I will be loving them all in no time!  I made my personal top 5 MOMENTS of the album: 1. ""The Blacker The Berry"" - absolute classic 2. ""King Kunta""s Hook - so vibing to this 3. ""Mortal Man"" OUTRO - unbelievable! loving it 4. 2nd verse of ""u"" - total opposite of ""i"", amazing idea and great voice changes in this part of the song, great thing! 5. ""Alright"" - great song with a nice Hook from Pharrell. dope!  Just an opinion guys :)"

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,findthedog,9,Mon Mar 16 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"And what, pray tell, does ""Nas'ing an album"" mean?"
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,Oli_Row,5,Tue Mar 17 14:47:41 2015 UTC,Following up a masterpiece with something far subpar in comparison. I think that's what he is saying.  It'd be pretty hard to argue that this is not closer in quality to GKMC than Nas's second album was to Illmatic.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,eklxtreme,4,Mon Mar 16 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yo wtf, It Was Written was a great album. Definitely not comparable to Illmatic (cause what albums are?), but still a very good album in its own right. Though I do agree that the next three albums were kinda lame and pretty mediocre, but that's not what you were referencing."

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,Tehril3y,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:38:45 2015 UTC,I really disliked King Kunta and I wasn't digging Institutionalized or Momma. Mortal Man made the album for me. That ending is so awesome.

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,gpmcadam,2,Mon Mar 16 05:17:26 2015 UTC,Why is he still being referred to as K. Dot? Didn't he throw that shit away at the end of GKMC?
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,kingkdot,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:21:54 2015 UTC,He officially threw it away back in 2010 with the Kendrick Lamar EP.  Doesnt mean he still calls himself that sometimes.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,orangiyx,2,Mon Mar 16 13:04:40 2015 UTC,Anyone else reckon King Kunta is similar to Hood Gone Love It by Jay Rock? Yeah I know kendrick is featured in it.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,Right_All_The_Time,2,Mon Mar 16 17:06:27 2015 UTC,King Kunta is my favorite so far.
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,Right_All_The_Time,2,Mon Mar 16 21:35:58 2015 UTC,anyone else a bit sad that the untitled colbert report song wasnt added to this album?

I'm so excited to see how this album changes Hip Hop in years to come.  As Anthony Fontana put it so eloquently on review:   ""Kendrick is someone who I think signifies a new chapter, and hopefully maybe a turn of the final page on the remnance of ""the bling era"" that had been holding on for dear life.  ""I'm not trying to say every artist should try to make this record, you only get so many Kendrick Lamars so be happy with the ones you get, but it's albums like this that people use as benchmarks in musical history and it just happens to be fantastically enjoyable aswell.""

Yeah as huge fan of GKMC I'm mostly turned off by this so far.  All the hooks from GKMC are mostly absent here.  Going to need to give it a bunch more full listens through to get it more."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,Figgerson,2,Tue Mar 24 23:37:14 2015 UTC,Mortal Man is my favorite thing so far

KendrickLamar,2z7b20,mejjos,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:14:10 2015 UTC,Can Someone tell me the basic concept of the whole album?? I can't put it together. Im on my second listen and what I'm getting is its about him transitioning into a rich celebrity and depression coming with that n also while going thru all this he realizes that rich whites or people of higher wealth are controlling and using minorities to stay in control and gain even more wealth ?
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,Oxy-cotton,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"I love it, I think it talks about a lot of important issues as well as a lot of more introspective topics. I think the problem I have with it is that Kendrick got WAY to ahead of himself. Every song has something important to talk about in every verse- it doesn't let you breathe that much. Nor is there really any fun tracks, this album is a fucking downer. Even the new ""i"" cuts itself off for a rant. That being said what other rap album can you say that about? Not many and that's what makes it so good. Idk I just wish there were some tracks I could play on their own without sounding completely severed and out of context y'know? I can still listen to them but they definitely lose something but as I play songs individually more I guess they start to work.   Also TBTB works so well on this album as the whole thing is engrossed in funk jazz and soul and that was like a sucker punch out of nowhere- I wish he didn't have it as a single so it could have been a complete surprise."
KendrickLamar,2z7b20,mhcincy513,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's outstanding, his artistry, ear for production, cohesion and arguably even lyricism are all improved. It's K Dot further continuing his story and legend"

KendrickLamar,2z8qgu,Awhile2,3,Mon Mar 16 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""cut the bull like a matador"" - I get that, but the ""bullshit matador"" line on For Free really sort of comes out of nowhere and doesn't really fit the context of the previous lines. That combined with the fact that he emphasizes the line in a similar way to how Ride emphasizes it on ""No Love"" (most of the backing track drops out as he yells ""BULLSHIT, MATADOR"") it just seems like a little too much of a coincidence for a dude as well-versed in the hip-hop world as Kendrick to have made accidentally. That, and he says ""the powers that be"" literally in the next track.  EDIT: also, the lyrics following the bullshit matador line feel very Death Grips - ""had the door knockin' - let em in - who's that?"" is very similar to the rapid paranoid mutterings by Ride on the same Death Grips album that features ""No Love"" - in particular ""footsteps on the stairs - who are they? - don't care"""

Sing about me was my favorite song in GKMC due to deep story, and in this album u is my personal favorite. Its hard to listen to, to listen to a grown man cry, but he really poured his heart out.  So he completely redid i, as in rerecorded it. He has much more power put into it now.

Other than the fact that this comes directly after GKMC in Kendrick's discography, TPAB isn't a follow up to GKMC. If you are looking for GKMC2, you won't like it, because that's not what it is. If you are looking for new Kendrick music and have your mind open to listen for a new sound from Kendrick, you will probably enjoy it."
KendrickLamar,2zc8wi,joshb98,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:36:40 2015 UTC,"As soon as you expect consistency in style with any artist you set yourself for disappointment. You can expect quality and pleasurable sounds, but as soon as you expect something in the vein of another album, you automatically set your opinion to be biased. No you're not the only one to dislike the album. Are you right to dislike it? Sure. But give it a couple more listens, use rap genius for a couple, listen to his moods in his voice/tone/lyrics compared to the sounds playing along with the rapping and singing. Seriously try rapgenius, it helps to stay on track with the lyrics (I got lost a lot)."
KendrickLamar,2zc8wi,Peeners,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"I got a bone to pick (see what I did there?) with how everybody is saying you cannot compare this to S80 to GKMC. Both of them had heavy elements of identifying social issues and bringing them to the attention of the people. TPaB does the same, but is mostly focused at finding answers and solutions to these very problems, and Kendrick leads his listeners to these answers. I'd say one would be very justified in calling TPaB a follow up to both S80 and GKMC. Each album is a different story being told, but they're all out of the same book that Kendrick is writing.    Edit: Check out my post, where I culminated a ton of my thoughts and analysis of the album (in the links and in the comment section of the post,) and I think you might see more of what I'm saying. http://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/2zcnla/the_album_is_glorious_some_of_my_thoughts_on_it/"
KendrickLamar,2zc8wi,PM-ME-UR-ART,3,Tue Mar 17 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Try listening to it a few more times. Listen again with a different approach, you can't treat TPAB like you would his previous work or you won't like it."
KendrickLamar,2zc8wi,GB_Neji,2,Tue Mar 17 13:20:59 2015 UTC,Why were you expecting GKMC 2.0?

KendrickLamar,2z7d66,Tomoromo9,3,Mon Mar 16 05:25:12 2015 UTC,Really good writing. Perhaps you could write more about the effective use of wordplay (unless that's not part of the assignment). It's hard to write 100% of the meaning of that amazing song but I feel like that would add a lot.
KendrickLamar,2z7d66,eklxtreme,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:26:20 2015 UTC,Thanks! The assignment was to explain the beauty and emotion of a song.  What wordplay are you referring to though?

KendrickLamar,2z0sgx,duckworth_bennington,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:51:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's more of a gkmc type of song, it's a pity though cause I has potential to be really good"

KendrickLamar,2ytjil,thatkidfromthatshow,4,Thu Mar 12 20:07:14 2015 UTC,It's an extended version. Probably the one he performed at SNL and/or with a skit at the ending

KendrickLamar,2yuya5,pepperfod,3,Fri Mar 13 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"I think he's expressing his emotions through the song and he's also calling others the hypocrite because they blame white police brutality, without ever considering that black on black crime going on behind the scenes."

KendrickLamar,2ypa6a,PhysicsNerd8,7,Wed Mar 11 18:28:15 2015 UTC,I hope it follows some sort of narrative like his last album.
KendrickLamar,2ypa6a,TheRittyl,5,Wed Mar 11 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"I want to hear anything and everything Kendrick wants me to hear. That being said, I do hope that the album isn't 100% completely about black issues, because as a scrawny white kid from Australia, I don't think that will resonate with me as well as it does in GKMC. Just my thoughts, I'm sure whatever comes out will be my favourite album of the year!"
KendrickLamar,2ypa6a,plith,2,Thu Mar 12 04:59:43 2015 UTC,I think that his song from Colbert actually has a fairly high chance of being on the album. It has the racially charged lyrics which seems to be an important theme of this album.

Section.80 has better singles, but the narrative that builds when you listen to Good Kid m.A.A.d. City cover-to-cover is untouchable. It's so fantastic.

I, blacker the berry, love game, hiiipower, are all songs I've listened to so yeah I am pretty new to kendrick. I like all of those songs, but I know there are more 'classic' Kendrick songs and I want to listen to real Kendrick if that makes any sense."

KendrickLamar,2y72e5,JKirbyy,7,Sat Mar 7 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"Just pre-ordered the album and listened, it is super eerie. Kinda chilling, and I'm even more excited for the album now."
KendrickLamar,2y72e5,XxTRIPLSHTxX,4,Sat Mar 7 18:34:26 2015 UTC,The wait is going to be soo long. The only thing that will disappoint me is if the album doesn't have a narrative to it. What I love about G.K.M.C is the journey it takes you on and the story it tells.
KendrickLamar,2y72e5,OrangeScarface,4,Sat Mar 7 20:01:28 2015 UTC,Is there any way to listen to this version or specifically that part? Without buying it on iTunes?
KendrickLamar,2y72e5,Pigman232,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm going buy it physically so I don't want to pre order it on itunes and have to get it digitally"
KendrickLamar,2y72e5,OrangeScarface,3,Sat Mar 7 23:32:41 2015 UTC,Same especially since I don't have nothing to put ITunes in.

KendrickLamar,2y724r,JKirbyy,3,Sat Mar 7 01:18:38 2015 UTC,"Rap Genius is great but is just peoples interpretations. You can get more out of the music if you use rap genius to develop your own ideas, rather than just use its interpretation."
KendrickLamar,2y2vhg,hanothere,10,Thu Mar 5 23:38:59 2015 UTC,Can you explain I don't get it
KendrickLamar,2y2vhg,ANAL_CHAKRA,13,Fri Mar 6 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"It is a quote of Kendrick from the song Ignorance is Bliss which was in a mixtape he dropped in 2010 (Overly Dedicated). He said he'll make an album that will make Martin Luther King and Malcom X proud. Today in 2015, he has released   the title ""i"" which can be associated with Martin Luther King ideologies and ""The Blacker The Berry"" which can be associated with Malcom X ideologies. So basically he's making the album he promised he'll make 5 years ago :)"
KendrickLamar,2y2vhg,OGthugbangbang,2,Fri Mar 6 15:25:14 2015 UTC,In the end I dont really think the blacker the berry was any thing like malcom x intended. He kinda calls out the whole black pride thing at the end.
KendrickLamar,2y2vhg,joaaogui,3,Fri Mar 13 00:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, please."

KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,eklxtreme,4,Sat Feb 28 20:18:11 2015 UTC,Good to see others appreciating this man Kendrick's work for what it is.
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,Ashurbanipal18,3,Sat Feb 28 22:32:45 2015 UTC,Nothing kendrick makes is weak.
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,bluntmaster630,3,Sun Mar 1 07:19:27 2015 UTC,"I cried when I heard this! As a mom just wow, this is the best song on there for me, I appreciate it with you :)"
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,pop_rock,3,Sat Feb 28 22:47:02 2015 UTC,People don't like real?  It's easily one of my favorites on GKMC
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,EpicRaptor,3,Sun Mar 1 21:38:35 2015 UTC,"I disliked it at first, then I really listened to it and now Im obsessed. Honestly the people that dont like Real are the same people that listen through the album once to follow the ""King Kendrick"" trendy hype and only glanced over Real, noting its apparent ""weak hook""."
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,Scorch8482,2,Wed Mar 4 04:22:12 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my experience with the song. I feel like some people listen to Kendrick's songs individually on shuffle or something which is totally wrong because his singles alone are not that special; it's only when you put the songs together for the album that you understand the whole story and become amazed. When you listen to the entire album, then you see the genius of Kendrick."
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,Scorch8482,3,Wed Mar 4 11:42:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. A lot of people dont even realize that Swimming pools is anti-alcohol. People are quick to bang, even when its not a banger."
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,hazethehaze,2,Wed Mar 4 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"my fav kendrick track, so cathartic"
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,hanothere,2,Sun Mar 1 08:59:53 2015 UTC,"Real is like the pinacle of GKMC I mean the album wouldn't mean a lot without it. He painted a clear image Compton struggles of people but a lot people can also relate to what he said.   I remember when I was on RapGenius trying to understand the plan A,B,C lines and man I surprise by how deep it was.  Great Song, great album!"
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,babajide-kfc,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"I Love the hook man its real itself, its like a victory song and its really joyful!!!!"
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,kimsebyuk,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:09:17 2015 UTC,I didn't like it too much until last week when I gave it a good listen. It was one of those songs where you overlook years later you find out its one of the best tracks on the album.
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,Wrath-of-Ragnar,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"Im a big fan of real  If you want a ""bad"" kendrick song listen to ""Michael Jordan"""
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,kujo777,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:40:33 2015 UTC,Hey I love both of those songs. Real is in my top 5 k.dot songs but Michael Jordan isn't in my top 20 but I still love it.
KendrickLamar,2xhpg5,ExtolFan,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"I think it is really important to the flow of the album, and I really enjoy it. I still struggle getting through the hook though, and I do think it is one of the weaker songs Kendrick has done. It's not No Makeup though, so it has that going for it."
KendrickLamar,2x76c2,peekadosies,14,Thu Feb 26 04:33:32 2015 UTC,"This took me about 8 hours to make, I hope you all really like it!"

KendrickLamar,2x76c2,Scorch8482,1 point,Fri Feb 27 00:51:38 2015 UTC,You're more than welcome to download the image and print it out at your local printing place. It should cost you something like $20 or so.
KendrickLamar,2wxkwi,Onepieceop101,3,Tue Feb 24 00:21:41 2015 UTC,"Great song, but SoTW? I still haven't had time to process it man!"
KendrickLamar,2wxkwi,mffocused,2,Tue Feb 24 23:23:37 2015 UTC,"actually ""u"" contradicts ""i"" and vice versa"
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,gokovi27,12,Mon Feb 23 23:35:39 2015 UTC,"It's still the same Kendrick behind the mic though. The verses have the authenticity of a Kendrick song and it's true to his morals too. I would say it's like Outkast, funky with a bit of a pop element."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,eklxtreme,5,Tue Feb 24 00:30:29 2015 UTC,That's what what I don't get when people bash the song it's still kendrick with meaning behind his lyrics. And I would definitely say it sounds like outkast before I'd say it sounds like pop
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,llAquamanll,8,Tue Feb 24 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for myself since I love the song, but im gonna guess it's the same reason that people on r/Eminem hate songs like 'The Monster' since it sounds too pop"
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,Warlordthewinner,10,Tue Feb 24 00:05:25 2015 UTC,Yea but i is nowhere as poppy as The Monster
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,ItsAlwaysSunnyInCali,9,Tue Feb 24 23:34:10 2015 UTC,"For me it's because it's not the ""classic Kendrick."" It's so different than other songs that he has made. Everything is so upbeat and what's up with his voice? It's like he tried out a pop rap style song and I like the classic Kendrick style better."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,AnalLaser,3,Tue Feb 24 00:22:46 2015 UTC,Listen to Celebration which I think is on his EP. Its like the second track and incredibly upbeat and positive. I personally can't stand the argument that it's not classic kendrick when 1) he has made an upbeat song and 2) the song turns pretty dark in the second half
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,ItsAlwaysSunnyInCali,3,Tue Feb 24 15:12:48 2015 UTC,"Celebration is actually my favorite track on his EP. I don't know what it is about ""I,"" but I just don't like it. I guess just because you like a artist doesn't mean you have to like every song that he makes."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,AnalLaser,2,Wed Feb 25 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"That's fair that you don't have to like every song of his whether you're a diehard or not, I just feel that you're original reasoning didn't really make sense to me.  And I agree, Celebration is fucking awesome :)"
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,kimsebyuk,3,Wed Feb 25 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I love about it. He is experimenting with different styles and I think it works really well. For creative people, it can be difficult/boring to do the same thing over and over."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,CurrentlyComatose,2,Tue Feb 24 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"The voice. If it was just his normal voice the whole song, i'd like it."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,chongdaddy,3,Tue Feb 24 02:46:14 2015 UTC,But he uses different voices (tones) for soo many of his songs! Thats what I love about k dot
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,unseine,1 point,Tue Feb 24 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"As much as I like ""i"" every live version has been better than the studio version because of his voice."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,unseine,2,Tue Feb 24 03:00:50 2015 UTC,Because people are allowed to not like a song. There doesn't need to be a reason to hear a song and not like it.
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,joeyjuancanobey,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:12:54 2015 UTC,"If you don't like a song, you don't like a song whatever your opinion, I personally love it. But when I hear people say that they're not exited for his next album because of this song I wanna hear their reasoning behind that."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,Ashurbanipal18,2,Tue Feb 24 15:37:48 2015 UTC,Because they think it will sound like the song they don't like?
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,BritishConsultant,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but just because of one song I personally can't understand why a kendrick lamar fan wouldn't be exited for his next album no matter how much the disliked a single. Just my opinion."

KendrickLamar,2wxf59,negro_jamal,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"""i"" will make more sense after the album drops. It's not on the album, but it's an answer to a song, ""u"", on the album. The two songs have a yin-yang vibe. And yeah I love ""i"". Kendrick's a versatile artist. There's no set style about him."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,giantpandasonfire,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:22:49 2015 UTC,Cuz its happy and k dances like a duck in the video
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,unseine,-1,Sat Mar 14 12:22:27 2015 UTC,People love how lyrically talented he is but his single 'i' seems like he's trying to get more into hip hop sort of music instead of the amazing lyrics he wrote in 'Good Kid M.A.A.D City'. But he explains himself in this video: http://youtu.be/tItZsMcLSRM?t=6m5s
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,Eamonohare,-11,Tue Feb 24 06:05:42 2015 UTC,"Nothing about it is chill like the old Kdot. Same with blacker the berry, I don't like his new mood. It's almost like he stopped smoking dope and just started getting into conspiracy theories while becoming sort of a mainstream artist who's trying too hard to be important. Gonna be sticking to artists like Joey from now on. It's a shame he changed so much."
KendrickLamar,2wxf59,unseine,6,Tue Feb 24 07:11:41 2015 UTC,Yeah because Keisha's song where the prostitute gets stabbed in the bladder was so chill.
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,Getalifenliveit,19,Sun Feb 22 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"I think it will. Hip hip is becoming more mainstream by the minute. The entire genre belongs to the modern counterculture, but is slowly being commercialized and transformed into pop just like rock was. I think people that appreciate artistry will see GKMC as an outstanding example of artistry within the genre. I can't think of any other album in hip hop that is as cohesive, conscious AND mainstream. However, I have a feeling it will not be Kendrick's best work. Kendrick is now the leader of the new school. All eyes are on him. He's one of the only hip hop artists who is dedicated to a message and has the resources of the industry to bring it to the mainstream. He is as wise and popular as tupac ever was and I personally think his control verse is the kind of competition we should be seeing in hip hop. I expect his next album will be at least on par with GKMC in terms of poignancy, aesthetic and artistry, but I believe it is likely that his next album will be even more popular and will change the game yet again.  tl;dr GKMC will likely go down as one of the greatest albums in music (it already is imo), but Kendrick's next album will likely  raise the bar even higher."
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,salingersouth,6,Sun Feb 22 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling it will not be Kendrick's best work.     Holy shit, you have no idea how excited that thought makes me."
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,SoonersPwn,1 point,Mon Feb 23 07:45:44 2015 UTC,"Just listen to literally every verse hes put out post GKMC, there are quite a bit and I cant help as much as you would hope, but you can hear improvement, it is ridiculous. This next album will deserve plat in a week, that is their goal, anyways. Kendrick'll need to drop maybe one more single and he'll need a little more hype, and 1mil sales in 1 week is definitely possible. I expect this next album to have a lot of improvement, considering what I have heard on tracks like Blacker the Berry. I'll stay patiently waiting, you cant rush perfection. I expect it'll drop before May though, they said they were shooting for 1st qtr of 2015 so that puts it before the end of March, so we'll see."
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,DID_TSM_WONNED,1 point,Mon Feb 23 07:52:36 2015 UTC,IMO The Blacker the Berry is already one of his best songs ever
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,eklxtreme,8,Sat Feb 28 00:50:40 2015 UTC,"Probably as one of the greatest albums of the 21st century, if not the best. ""All time"" lists will always be dominated by classic rock and hip-hop is hardly ever found in the top 50 of those lists."
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,unseine,2,Mon Feb 23 06:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think section 80, GKMC and his next album will be seen as classics and he'll most likely fall off after that like most rappers."
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,joeyjuancanobey,2,Mon Feb 23 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"kendrick wont fall off b. he'll stop making music or die, but he won't release wack shit."

KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,joeyjuancanobey,0,Sat Mar 7 11:44:23 2015 UTC,They couldn't create an album like GKMC.
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,unseine,1 point,Sun Mar 8 06:05:10 2015 UTC,IDK what thats even supposed to mean. Like what are you saying that Em and Fifty don't have classics?
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,joeyjuancanobey,2,Sun Mar 8 17:41:33 2015 UTC,"No, they got classics. I'm talking about the storytelling and consciousness of GKMC.  EDIT: and downvoting because you disagree is rude."

KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,joeyjuancanobey,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:20:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I know Im just saying in general.
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,giantpandasonfire,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"There's already a lot of people in the hip hop community that don't see it as the greatest album of all time or near it specifically because of its age.  A great album but not ""greatest"" so far.  I think it's a great album with one weak spot (Poetic Justice, looking at you,), but Aquemini has Mamacita and it's still considered one of the greatest.  In all honesty I'm starting to go on the boat that Section.80 is a better album.  Both are great though, but Section.80 has some songs in it that just absolutely stand out.  Keisha's Song and HiiiPower.  ESPECIALLY HiiiPower.  I mean, the whole album itself is just amazing.  The first few tracks can be a bit bumpy at first but the rest goes down smooth."
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,DID_TSM_WONNED,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:48:40 2015 UTC,It already is one of the greatest albums of all time.  Only one that comes close to it imo is MBDTF
KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,ZaDu28,2,Sat Feb 28 00:49:29 2015 UTC,Only one that comes close to it imo is MBDTF   Do you mean just recent albums or all time?

KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,ZaDu28,2,Mon Mar 2 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but MBDTF is no where near the level of Illmatic, Ready To Die, Reasonable Doubt, or even GRODT. Hell, I thought College Dropout was better."

KendrickLamar,2wrxpe,akbison24,0,Tue Mar 3 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"No I don't see it happening, and don't take this as hate because I love me some kdot but there is a lot of reason why it won't be. Number 1 is hip hop doesn't get enough respect from other genres for it to be considered on of the best albums period. Number 2 is that it's not even in the best hip hop albums of all time unless you are talking about like top 50. Number 3 is we don't even know of its kendricks best album yet because he hopefully still has a long career ahead of him. Overall Gkmc is one of my favorite albums but it won't be regarded as one of the best of all time but i could see it getting recognized as one of the best albums of the decade"

KendrickLamar,2wknz6,Astrapsody,4,Fri Feb 20 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"I can understand not being able to identify with it, but that's because it's for a really certain group to identify with.  But you know, it's also just a few songs...I'd say wait for the album.  Especially because these songs are reactions to events going on."
KendrickLamar,2wknz6,giantpandasonfire,2,Fri Feb 20 19:50:17 2015 UTC,Hello Jasper
KendrickLamar,2wknz6,TBache,2,Fri Feb 20 20:56:58 2015 UTC,A lot of his music is centered on race. This is just bolder than normal. Personally I love the two new tracks but I am black so to some degree I identify with it.   I just think if you can vibe out to I and get amped when Blacker the Berry comes on you could enjoy it more and not be so focused on the lyrics at hand
KendrickLamar,2wknz6,MyNamesE,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:15:44 2015 UTC,If I I could only I identify with songs that talk about how hard it is being white I would not enjoy music.   Don't ever think that just because it isn't about you that the music still isn't for you.

KendrickLamar,2vj04t,Ashurbanipal18,3,Wed Feb 11 13:44:16 2015 UTC,I've been a kendrick fan since 2011. i Was 16 back then and he has influenced me alot. first track i heard him on was Hii Power. i was amazed by his lyrical genius and the pain in his voice. I could realate to his frustation of a World you live in but can't change. The best thing about kendrick is that he is a good kid in a mad city just like me. Some songs he embraces the Lifestyle in compton and on other songs he highlights the effects that Lifestyle he has on the people living there and that made me view life in a new way. He figured out the game by constantly work hardest i seem as a Young hov. One question i have whats your top 3 kendricks songs and why?

KendrickLamar,2vcmde,MichaelDawson1888,2,Mon Feb 9 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Can someone help me better interpret this song. I think I have the basic understanding of it. In some sense Kendrick is calling for self respect and strength in the black community. But to me it feels like the first two verses are more aggressive and a statement of him asserti Ng his black identity, and seems to represent the views that hes criticising. I dont know there's a good chance I'm talking out my ass but just wondering what the general thought is.  The song was incredible though, any help would be appreciated."
KendrickLamar,2vcmde,mypasswordis2chainz,10,Tue Feb 10 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"He's calling himself a hypocrite because he raps about the racism of whites when he has the same amount of racism in himself, towards the racist whites. He also says that it's hypocritical to cry about whites killing blacks when there are even more blacks killing blacks. It's hard to see on the surface check rap genius"
KendrickLamar,2vcmde,MichaelDawson1888,2,Tue Feb 10 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"Whilst I don't disagree with you at all, how would you interpret the first two verses where he's talking about not wanting to be friends and being a 'proud monkey' is this the hypocritical racism you're talking about or is this a real aggressive pro-black message?"
KendrickLamar,2vcmde,mypasswordis2chainz,2,Wed Feb 11 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"The entire song, with the exception of the last few lines, is rapped from the stance of a proud black man who is upset by the way his people are treated. Then in the last few lines of the song, he realizes that he treats his own people the same way as the 'enemy' (white people) by killing blacks himself. It spins the whole song around on itself. There is a tupac song that is also like this but I can't remember the name. It pretty much ends up saying the same thing as the controversial interview he had about 'loving yourself' that Cudi and azalea banks got so upset about. That's just how I interpret it at least"

KendrickLamar,2vcmde,lifeisledzep,0,Wed Feb 11 12:49:47 2015 UTC,"He's calling himself a hypocrite because his GKMC advocated that ""black on black violence"" must end. But if you look at any community there is violence in it no matter the skin colors. There's whites killing whites but we don't call it anything.  Last verse he bears down on the supremacy like y'all kill my people and we kill our people but we (the black community) are turned into dehumanized evil beings for doing something part of humanity. The line where he addresses trayvon is where he crosses the white/black killing and essentially says ""YOU, the supremacy, are HYPOCRITES""."

KendrickLamar,2vcmde,gordanfreeman50,5,Tue Feb 10 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"Haha I find that really funny, but I am genuinely interested in what he has to say. I don't have to agree with him, I just prefer conversations to have two sides at the very least :)"
KendrickLamar,2vcmde,Exapno,14,Tue Feb 10 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"Alright, before I get into this I need to make two things clear. First off, I'm a huge Kendrick Lamar fan. Ask any of my friends and they will attest to this. In fact Section.80 is the whole reason I got into hip-hop in the first place. I thought every part of that album was on point, excellent. My life wouldn't be the same without it. Ever since then there hasn't been a Kendrick Lamar song that I turned on and thought was off; GKMC, Overly Dedicated, Untitled, i were all beautifully crafted as far as I'm concerned.  Secondly, the way I judge music is if I'm feeling it or I'm not. This feeling can be attributed to a number of factors and affects you in different ways depending on the song. The best way I can describe it is it'll take you out of where you are in mind, spirit, etc. even though you're still physically there. This is what I loved about his previous concept albums, they take you on a journey.  The Berry is Blacker is for sure musically interesting and its lyrics intellectually stimulating. Also Kendrick showing off some mad control and vocal range. I also get musical progression and having a different sound for an album, you know, not getting stuck with the same formula. But I can't help to feel that we're losing the Kendrick Lamar that we fell in love with initially, especially since he's gone mainstream and has attained such a large audience. Where are the catchy hooks and smooth beats that stayed in your head for days? Where are the introspective lyrics that make you feel like he's a normal guy?  Sure the song has some powerful lines, and he can't really get into more depth than his other albums because after all this is just a single. But I feel like this position has been used to push a politically sensitive message with some sacrifice from the music for this one song specifically (I did enjoy that sick jazzy outro). It's gotten to the point where the community is just so polarized that if Kendrick released it, it's either 'more shitty rap' or 'amazing God like sound and message' and any judgement below the latter is treated with prejudice and hostility. Which can be seen 'locally' from /r/music and /r/hiphopheads as just a few examples. It's so cool that this community is not that way at all.  I'm glad that it has got people talking, that it even goes that far in depth, that he's further exploring his own roots and that he's still doing dark & gritty. Clearly Kendrick's talent lies in story telling, this is undisputed, and paired with the type sound we've heard in the past, is just awesome. Which is why I feel like Backstreet Freestyle in that regard is better (not in subject matter) if you can even compare the two.  Maybe it's because I thought the opening was weak, maybe it's because I didn't like his rhythm, maybe it's because of the contrast between the way he and Assassin enunciated their words, maybe it's because I didn't find the lyrics appealing, or maybe it's a combination of a few (or everything) I've mentioned. But I just didn't feel this song.  Edit: I'm not a very good writer so I apologize in advanced for any errors in writing and unclear thoughts (and the wall of text). You might also notice I've grabbed a few bits and pieces from around the web while gathering my thoughts and seeing what others had to say."
KendrickLamar,2vcmde,gordanfreeman50,5,Wed Feb 11 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"I really wish I could give a more substantial answer here than what I am going to give. Firstly thank you so much for taking the time to answer my simple question so thoroughly. I know this sounds contradictory. I am trying ny absolute best to answer what I am feeling, I just think your answer is still better  Secondly, this is very strange because I agree with what you are saying. Kendrick does feel at his best when it's a ""story"" he is telling. Though like you say I would like to hear this in context of the album.  (I hope it doesn't feel like I'm putting words into your mouth here by saying I agree and then maybe saying things thst you didn't mean in the same way.)  I always say to my cousin when he asks for one Kendrick song to get an idea of what he's like, that I can't do that. I can't give him one song and have him judge the artist that way.  Hoewever I am doing that a little bit. I recognise that I am caught in the hype train. But I also think that for a single release it is a very powerful message, but without the context of the full album I can't tell whether or not it forms part of a powerful narrative.  I hope what I'm trying to say is making sense, I agree with you but I reach a slightly different conclusion than you do. All of this being said I am enjoying the track so far. It's just strange to listen to it and then nothing. We need this album to drop so badly.   EDIT: I just thought of something else. Edited this before anyone replied  Concerning his sound it is different from GKMC but there are still Kendrick cues that I recognise. (His voice sound sa lot like he does on the control verse but thats not really what I meant by cues). Of course I can't think of a single one now :)   Also please excuse typos and me being late to reply. I am typing on my phone and typos aren't underlined. My lste reply is because I am South African so I was sleeping until now."
KendrickLamar,2vcmde,negro_jamal,3,Wed Feb 11 05:04:15 2015 UTC,"yea for the context of the album, i really hope he only has a few ""angry"" songs but i can see some songs like ""peer pressure"" fitting into the album"

KendrickLamar,2vbrv7,howmaywehelpyou,12,Mon Feb 9 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"This is often true with many artists and it is certainly true with Kendrick; don't listen to just a song here and there. Listen to a full album. While his songs all tell a separate story they are all fitting with the overreaching arc of the album they are from.  So, listen to GKMC and Section 80 in full to actually ""get"" Kendrick."

KendrickLamar,2vbrv7,giantpandasonfire,4,Sun Feb 15 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Kendrick isn't really a singles artist.  You can listen to his singles but a lot of times it's just, ""So what?""  It's when you listen to the full album that it's like ""WOW"".  GKMC tells a full cohesive story, just listening to a single is like reading a book and just dropping yourself in the middle of a chapter with no reference.  But if you like...really absolutely want some individual songs, check out the Art of Peer Pressure, mAAd City, and Rigamortis IMO.  But really...listen to the whole albums."

City The Jig is Up The Heart (part 2) Blacker the Berry (brand new as of hours ago, is unbelievably good) Cartoon and Cereal Ronald Reagan Era The Recipe  Not to disrespect Section .80, it is a top notch brilliant album, but seriously if you haven't listened to GKMC in it's entirety, do it TODAY. There's this thing that happens where you can't stop thinking or talking about it for weeks and you realize that music has so much unexplored potential that is rarely utilized. It will open worlds for you."
KendrickLamar,2vbrv7,timmypakia,3,Tue Feb 10 04:23:06 2015 UTC,"Start with Section .80. Listen to rigamortis, hol' up, hiiipower, ADHD, Fuck Your Ethnicity.

Better than OD imo).  No Sleep Til NYC: Jay rock and Kdot trade verses over classic beats.   C4: Kendrick coping that weezy flow  Training Day: Kendricks 2nd tape; has some good tracks  Hub City Threat; Minor of the Year: His first tape. Better than average but not great.  Two more mixtapes to consider because they contain unreleased tracks: Compton State of Mind 1 and 2. Very good tapes and has plenty of unreleased tracks that wouldve been on OD/Section80/GKMC."

Jay Rock goes hard though, and Ab-Soul is brilliant by far has the best lines on this track, it is his track though. But the effortless way in which Kendrick welcomes you to the track , I just can't describe Kendrick and Ab-Soul in words."

KendrickLamar,2t9fsa,GreenBayTide,4,Thu Jan 22 05:50:21 2015 UTC,"Itd probably be very tiresome to do such, but I will say this; his songs and lyrics contained within most often have double, even triple meanings.   On a similar note, someone on rapgenius a while ago mentioned that (i) is written in the lower case, because it offers the double meaning of (in mathematical terms) an imaginary number. This is (again) a call back to the track real, in which he claims he is really, really real. Well, Maybe he isnt in this situation? Maybe this track fits into the album like a hallucination. This is my theory, at the least. Its crazy how detailed everything is."

KendrickLamar,2sgluk,Astrapsody,3,Thu Jan 15 06:00:25 2015 UTC,Keisha's song is great I love how his tone changes throughout. Generally I think section.80 had better standalone tracks but gkmc told a better story as a whole

KendrickLamar,2s87am,TheKingInTheNorth98,1 point,Tue Jan 13 07:13:16 2015 UTC,I kind of remember reading in his billboard cover story that he's not even sure if that track will make it onto the final album
KendrickLamar,2s87am,JSN111,3,Tue Jan 13 15:51:12 2015 UTC,What are we supposed to talk about?
KendrickLamar,2s87am,Astrapsody,2,Tue Jan 13 04:27:57 2015 UTC,Yup. You're the only one it seems. And me I guess
KendrickLamar,2s87am,not-a-celebrity,2,Tue Jan 13 03:53:03 2015 UTC,"We are pumped! Unfortunately Kendrick hasn't released much info. Believe me, as soon as another single drops or we get a title, the hype levels will be maxed."
KendrickLamar,2s87am,Scorch8482,-1,Tue Jan 13 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid of expecting too much of him. I believe his album will be good, but he's been quite cheesy lately with 'i love myself' and songs hes featured in (like the spiderman one). GKMC was so good though"

KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,fraynor,3,Mon Jan 12 03:00:21 2015 UTC,An interesting point to bring up! I think most people are too busy hating No Makeup to realize its own talents.
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,Scorch8482,2,Mon Jan 12 13:05:38 2015 UTC,People hate on it?
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,Scorch8482,3,Mon Jan 12 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"I think many consider it his worst song. I disagree, but I still think its rather weak."
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,Scorch8482,3,Mon Jan 12 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"Damn I consider it one of his bests. What's your reasoning for your opinion, just curious"
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,Washman360,3,Mon Jan 12 16:21:57 2015 UTC,"The hook.... It reminds me of something from a boy band. The verse arent bad, but not great. The beat is less than stellar."
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,redaws,2,Mon Jan 12 17:36:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that's part of the point. The song is about make up it would make sense to have a radio-esque theme. Besides the vocals are heavily affected to make it feel more like a beat
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,hazethehaze,2,Mon Jan 12 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"The song is talking about how you don't need all this flashy makeup and cover up, music these days can be so full of heavy bass and special effects so this minimalist beat represents the beauty in simplicity"
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,ssonti,2,Thu Jan 15 18:41:00 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was kinda going for
KendrickLamar,2s4j4t,ssonti,2,Thu Jan 15 20:39:07 2015 UTC,I've only listened to it once. Now I just skip it cause the hook is really loud and I don't think it matches the atmosphere of section 80
KendrickLamar,2rynpi,crossbow789,5,Sat Jan 10 13:56:37 2015 UTC,Fuck off Azalea Banks.
KendrickLamar,2rynpi,wremt,2,Sat Jan 10 18:56:20 2015 UTC,I like how she implies that blacks are generally discriminated and left out and one tweet later goes full retard and tells him to not generalize (in an angry way too). How dense can you acutally be...?
KendrickLamar,2rynpi,ScienceBestReligion,2,Sat Jan 10 21:02:02 2015 UTC,Azalea banks is an idiot he was saying that some people don't respect themselves so they can't expect other to respect its not a race thing dumb bitch.

KendrickLamar,2qsks9,Scorch8482,2,Fri Jan 2 23:58:54 2015 UTC,Dont forget his untitled performance on Steven Colbert
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,vult-r,14,Mon Dec 29 07:08:26 2014 UTC,Yes. People were asking the same thing about Section.80. Will he do it this time? Who knows. For some it will be better and for others it won't.  I know some people prefer Section.80 to m.A.A.d city anyway.
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,Astrapsody,3,Mon Dec 29 07:27:57 2014 UTC,"I just dig the overall sound picture of Section.80 a lot more. GKMC is a great piece of art, and i love it as a whole, but i almost never see myself revisiting single song from that album, while i often do from section.80"
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,ssonti,1 point,Mon Jan 5 16:19:25 2015 UTC,I am the same as you. I love GKMC and Section.80 very much but I find my self listening to more singles from Section.80 like Hol' up or Poe Man's Dreams more than singles on GKMC. For me I think there is too much talking on maad city. I enjoy listening to the whole album but when I want to listen to a single song I don't want to sit through the talking every time.
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,SociallyAWKSOME,9,Wed Jan 7 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"I dont think so. The narrative and the storyline in gkmc... that album is a masterpiece. You have to listen to it again and again and again. I think that its one of the best hh albums in a long, long time. Im curious for what story is kendrick telling this time."
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,not-a-celebrity,3,Mon Dec 29 12:46:10 2014 UTC,I think it will probably be very different from GKMC. Most of the songs he's released so far have seemed to be much more upbeat and poppy. I think comparing the two might be hard to do.
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,killerqueen13,4,Mon Dec 29 18:46:02 2014 UTC,"Hearing his single ""I"" makes me think he wont top Gkmc"
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,killerqueen13,3,Mon Dec 29 21:13:26 2014 UTC,What about 'i' makes you think that?
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,jvdave23,2,Mon Dec 29 22:23:08 2014 UTC,"Like the comment above mine states,  its too upbeat and poppy. I personally dont like that style."
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,killerqueen13,2,Tue Dec 30 00:34:29 2014 UTC,"I was a little underwhelmed too by ""I"" but then his rap on Colbert was amazing. So I have faith again."

KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,hazethehaze,2,Tue Dec 30 12:33:26 2014 UTC,"I feel that with this new album, although it may not top GKMC from the critics' standpoint, it'll break barriers of hip-hop music and prove the incredible potential that Kendrick has as an artist.   The new songs have very positive vibes and I think he'll blow our minds with the messages he sends to the youth."
KendrickLamar,2qoxfl,Fritewong,2,Tue Dec 30 01:47:49 2014 UTC,"If theres one thing ive learnt about Kendrick.  No matter what beat, No matter who's he on the track with he kills it.  There is not one a song that has the same flow, delivery and lyrics, the dude is an alien."

KendrickLamar,2qnn85,a13xand3r,2,Mon Dec 29 02:05:27 2014 UTC,Only the first verse of Sing About Me is there. I was kinda expecting a part 2 with the rest of the song of perhaps the Dying of Thirst part and I only expected another part because it actually said there would be another one.

KendrickLamar,2pxosx,gayd3n,7,Sun Dec 21 01:32:54 2014 UTC,I feel like Now or Never (bonus track on GKMC) was actually supposed to be for Kendrick's new album. It has really positive vibes in the lyrics like i and that type of raw instrumentation that he said would be on the new album.
KendrickLamar,2pxosx,eklxtreme,1 point,Sun Dec 21 06:23:35 2014 UTC,"I think the reason for this is, well, Never Catch Me he does swear, but Untitled was only performed once and that was live and i is kinda Kendricks ""Happy""."
KendrickLamar,2pxosx,Scorch8482,1 point,Sun Dec 21 05:25:43 2014 UTC,Older adults aren't going to listen to GKMC because all they're going to here is some ignorant kid rapping and not take the time to look at the lyrics   What makes you think that? Older guys are going to like it more than younger guys because they'll understand it more.
KendrickLamar,2pxosx,FourO40,1 point,Thu Dec 25 18:24:29 2014 UTC,"Older people who grew up listening to this type of music (rap) and still listen to it, yes. But I'm talking about those who think all rap is horrible, all the people who do it/like it are 'sinners' or whatever."

KendrickLamar,2piztg,NotEvenClosest,1 point,Wed Dec 17 05:04:19 2014 UTC,"I know its typical to freak out on those who haven't listened to him yet, but I need to stress how important it is that you listen to him. Good Kid Maad City is (at the least a one hour story) with twists and turns and depicts Kendrick in a very poignant position in the in. Plus it will be one of the most influential albums of the decade. Untitled shouldn't be the reason you pick up Good Kid MAAAd city.  Section.80 is just as good. If GKMC is a 10, S.80 is a 9.9. Not as influential and it has a couple minor flaws, but still a masterpiece  Beyond that, the Kendrick Lamar EP is very important to Kendrick as a person. I would recommend you listen to that over OD, as it features some of Kendrick's most importants tracks hell over publish."

KendrickLamar,2ilpzx,Scorch8482,1 point,Thu Oct 23 04:48:37 2014 UTC,"CSoM wasn't an official mixtape, rather a compilation of unreleased tracks and songs off of earlier mix tapes. You also forgetting C4, Training Day, no sleep til nyc, and Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year.   My order:  GKMC: a 10/10  Section.80: a 9.99999/10 (has better tracks/singles but GKMC is a better overall album)  Kendrick Lamar EP: Tracks like Faith and Its Love cannot be ignored.  OD: Has better versions of some EP tracks but falls short in other tracks (like Alien Girl or average joe).  -EP and OD can switch depending on the month. Both have their flaws and pro's that make it almost purely opinion.  Now we get into the ""underground"":  No Sleep too NYC: If I could I'd put this higher but I feel like I'm cheating a bit because it's a joint tape with Rock. Tracks like Dead Pres III and It ain't hard 2 tell just deliver on every level. Love the ab soul features as well. Great and cohesive.  C4: Has some good tracks like Shot Down, West Coast Wy Tang and the unforgettable Best Rapper under 25, however the other tracks leave much to be desired.  Training Day: Very obvious that Kendrick was young and new to his career with this album, yet there are still some solid tracks here like Good Morning America and Blow them Horns. Still, his flow here is very irregular (at this point his still articulating his flow) and so the tape is forgettable. Interviews were interesting but didn't do much but interrupt the music.  YNIC: I don't feel I can rate this. Kendrick might not even be able to drive yet at the point of which he dropped this. It was small sale and literally had his number, email, etc. on the tape for anyone listening to call him for deals/performances. The tracks are all pretty weak, but we get some glances into Kendricks early flow and self, which will prove to be a huge contrast to how he turns out to be on GkMc, where he directly attacks the person he was on this tape. Still an instant skip though.  The CSoM's are really good however, so if I had to rate them in ther id have the first one after section.80 and the 2nd after EP."

Truly changed modern rap. Section.80 - Wasn't quite as revolutionary as GKMC, still amazing though. Lyricism was next level, insane progress from his earlier stuff.

If you flip to your local hip-hop station you'll probably hear nothing but complete trash (Quan, Young Thug, 2 Chainz, Gotti, etc.) All I really listen to is Eminem, Kendrick, and occasionally stuff on the radio just for the instrumentals. When I heard i, I realized that Kendrick is doing what the underground guys are doing, but the difference is that he's arguably the most popular young rapper in the game right now. He's doing what nobody else seems to be doing...staying real and using his talent to repair the game."

KendrickLamar,2h7whg,Itsthinking,6,Wed Sep 24 23:53:57 2014 UTC,"Let's discuss; what does everyone think?   Personally I love the song.   However, I'm not sure how the general public (ie people outside of us die-hard kendrick fans) will take it. It doesn't have as much of the edge that I think people loved GKMC for. We'll see how the rest of the album comes out, but as yet I'm unsure whether this musical shift will ultimately hurt Kendrick or help secure his legacy."

Its obviously not what were used to hearing from K. Dot, but I welcome whatever he creates. I was really anxious about how Kendrick would've made a sample from ""Who's that lady"" work, since it isn't what we typically hear from him. Personally I've had this song on loop for the past few hours and I'm not tired of it, I can only wait until I get home where I can listen to this better and really dig into the lyrics of the song."

But, as far as fake TDE fans and fake Kendrick fans, this is the go-to song. Whenever I hear niggas at school bumping to this who were just bumping to Meek Mill or Nicki Minaj cringe I feel like this song summarizes that. Niggas don't even like the song. They like the beat drop. They switch it off as soon as MC Eiht comes in.  So, I do love this song but whenever I hear it, it reminds me of fake fans."

Hes a guy trying to get his story across through an uncommon medium. I think it is unfair for anyone to assume that he is just in it for girls or money. He's telling us these stories to inspire us.

KendrickLamar,25fcaj,Kendarlington,2,Wed May 14 11:01:56 2014 UTC,"If you like the first half of P&P off of OD, then you'll love the original P&P off of ""Kendrick Lamar Ep"". It's pretty much the same track, minus the second part.  The version on OD is ""P&P 1.5""  This EP is even earlier than OD, and super dope.  http://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Kendrick-Lamar-mixtape.88108.html  Faith is my second favorite off that EP after P&P"

KendrickLamar,258dgj,Onepieceop101,7,Sat May 10 22:07:19 2014 UTC,Who the fuck downvoted you because of your opinion wtf? This sub isn't even that active and it has assholes like this already?
KendrickLamar,258dgj,Arregui,2,Sun May 11 15:30:39 2014 UTC,A good and clear critique and lookback on his corrupt days/mind in his childhood. And even at that still a kickass song to get turnt too.   KENDRICK HAVE A DREAM
KendrickLamar,258dgj,Scorch8482,2,Sun May 11 00:52:40 2014 UTC,"Suggestion for next week's song: my personal favorite Kendrick song - The Art of Peer Pressure. It really delves into the life he had with his friends back in the day. The whole production of the song perfectly fits the mood of the song and his lyrical ability is stunning. You feel like you're a part of the story.  Great lyrics:  ""We made a right, then made a left, then a right / Then made a left, we was just circling life.""  ""Iâm usually a true firm believer of bad karma / Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you."""

On another note, I didn't really like his verse on it the first time I heard it, but I'm enjoying this more and more each time I listen."
KendrickLamar,24ufv7,Warlordthewinner,1 point,Tue May 6 23:03:16 2014 UTC,"To clarify, what I really enjoyed was the beat as well, not just his lyricism but the music overseeing it too."

KendrickLamar,24mopy,Only-Lies,1 point,Sun May 4 04:22:08 2014 UTC,Easily one of my favorite songs! Definitely my favorite instrumental from any rapper. Very unique flow on this with one and a lot of lyrical bombs love it!
KendrickLamar,24mopy,hiiipowa,1 point,Sat May 3 18:07:46 2014 UTC,"I really like this song, Kendrick's flow fits perfectly with the beat, and he has some amazing rhymes in there!  Also, the ""Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me"" line makes me smile every time.   I suggest Keisha's Song for next week."
KendrickLamar,24mopy,Jnthn,-1,Sat May 3 22:55:12 2014 UTC,"I liked last week's song of the week. This week it seems like the mod did a half assed job. Sorry, but it is true, look at last week's, much more info."
KendrickLamar,24mopy,MMLP2am,0,Sat May 3 17:17:01 2014 UTC,Care to explain how the last one was better?  Edit: never mind I just read your comment properly and we will try to get more info on songs next week
KendrickLamar,24mopy,Onepieceop101,1 point,Sat May 3 18:10:04 2014 UTC,"I think this weeks is fine, last week just had a lot more backstory with the HiiiPower movement, this song doesn't really have that big of a backstory, sure you could've added more, but I don't think it was any less than it should've been."

KendrickLamar,23noq5,not-a-celebrity,2,Tue Apr 22 16:13:38 2014 UTC,This is one of my favourites. Lyrical genius.
KendrickLamar,23noq5,shortfermata,2,Wed Apr 23 01:07:27 2014 UTC,Kendrick should just release an album with freestyles. I would buy it.

KendrickLamar,23h1ke,Thejackedupbunny,10,Sat Apr 19 23:48:16 2014 UTC,Definitely my favorite section 80 track. The production is so catchy and K Dot goes crazy with his bars. Great song.
KendrickLamar,23h1ke,1Grizr,5,Sun Apr 20 01:08:12 2014 UTC,"Couple songs to consider for next week:  Cartoon & Cereal (ft. Gunplay): I think this song was made either during the ""K.Dot"" era or just after it. Good song about Kendrick growing up with violence surrounding childhood.  HiiiPOWER: Song that pretty much embodies what the ""HiiiPower"" movement, that Kendrick and J.Cole started, is about. Heart, Honesty, and Respect.  Cut You Off (To Grow Closer): Commentary from Kendrick on how society is today."

I hated it ... In fact I didn't like him until I heard spiteful chant. After spiteful chant I gave GKMC another shot analyzed it lyrically and loved it! Swimming pools was somewhat enjoyable when I ignored the hooks and just listened to the verses."

KendrickLamar,1zzvcp,svarafly,2,Sun Mar 9 22:35:57 2014 UTC,Over on the lower sidebar above the Mods names there is a link that says Message the Moderators.  You're welcome to post issues here but it will save Warlord from having to send me a PM and fixes should get done quicker if everyone uses that link.  All my REDDITS are designed on a Samsung 4G phone and the max width for me to see on here is 1024px.  I had the images width set to 100% and obviously that code was useless.  I just uploaded a new one that hopefully will work with REDDITS settings.  PLEASE use the link above so we're all aware of any issues and as soon as I'm online I'll do my best to get any issues fixed.   If this new code doesn't work we'll keep after okay.  Cheers!

KendrickLamar,1w8x3y,americanblue,1 point,Wed Feb 5 17:40:09 2014 UTC,I will always remember the 2014 Grammy's as the year Kendrick showed Jay Z and the rest of the world what a real rapper is.
KendrickLamar,1w8x3y,unseine,3,Mon Jan 27 16:09:49 2014 UTC,"Jayz is partly responsible for making ""what real rap is"" and he is definitely responsible for helping Kendrick out."
KendrickLamar,1w8x3y,americanblue,3,Mon Jan 27 19:28:11 2014 UTC,"I don't disagree with you.  Jay Z is the face of rap today.  But, he is the Garth Brooks of rap music.  Average singer, average writer, average performer, but very smart and he's surrounded himself with a brilliant team. He's the biggest in the world and laughing all the way to the bank."
KendrickLamar,1w8x3y,unseine,1 point,Tue Jan 28 15:51:02 2014 UTC,Sorry no. Yes he has a lot of average songs but he has more than enough classics to cement him as top 5 too. The sheer volume of work he has put out for rap is immense and there is no way its for money any more.
KendrickLamar,1vlf9l,officialgravis,2,Sun Jan 19 14:55:45 2014 UTC,Very nice. I like that a lot.

KendrickLamar,1usz2o,nicpena,1 point,Thu Jan 9 16:27:38 2014 UTC,He adds so much feeling to the song. Nice job
KendrickLamar,1ticcq,funnyhowthings,3,Mon Dec 23 04:53:25 2013 UTC,"Doubt it, but check out His and Dr. Dre's commercial for Beats. If that doesnt get you excited for Kendricks next project Idk what will"

KendrickLamar,1kk7ro,TheBigUrban,6,Sat Aug 17 18:25:43 2013 UTC,At it's best
KendrickLamar,1kfl37,iceboy351,2,Thu Aug 15 18:03:31 2013 UTC,"That was quite humorous.    ""Personally, we here at CTS donât see it as a diss as much as an attempt by Lamar to get his other favorite artists to rise to the occasion and perhaps ignite a fire to the watered down, molly-trending lyrics and the bullshit instagram culture we see so often in the rap game lately.""  And that sentence was absolute gold.  Been listening to Kendrick for 3 years because of his mentality towards issues and the fact that he actually talks about them in his music.  The lack of that in modern rap music (there are still a few good ones, yes, but certainly not on the radio where most people hear it) has made it so my parents, innocently and to me understandably, assume any rap isn't really serious or worth respect."

KendrickLamar,1hwxxj,ChaostheSir,5,Tue Jul 9 04:22:56 2013 UTC,Not really big on the beat but Kendricks verse is pretty tight.
KendrickLamar,1hjcb7,FrancoisFOS,2,Wed Jul 3 01:12:49 2013 UTC,This is pretty dope
KendrickLamar,1e9xvv,bearr92,1 point,Mon May 13 22:49:53 2013 UTC,I am working on a critique for the song lyrics and video.
KendrickLamar,1c6e0h,smallbzman,3,Fri Apr 12 01:29:15 2013 UTC,A$AP Rocky :  1 train.    Doesn't feature T Pain...but features about 7 rappers and Kendrick is on the second verse.
KendrickLamar,1c6e0h,vsky,1 point,Sun Apr 21 03:57:28 2013 UTC,Not the track you're looking for but here's one in which he's featured that I thought I would share : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NfL2rqbH1M

KendrickLamar,1bkqe5,Nathan561,1 point,Fri Apr 5 02:52:49 2013 UTC,Welcome aboard.
KendrickLamar,1axk4o,Frak23,1 point,Sun Mar 24 20:45:33 2013 UTC,"Lyrics were great, they were clever and funny. Your flow needs work though. I checked out someone of your videos through /u/ ... once again lyrics were great, even though some of the concepts were kinda nerdy ""fracking"" hooks? come on... lol.   My advice, slow down and be the first white rapper to actually pick up following the beat of a song instead of fighting against it. Don't be machine gun kelly or eminem. Let the listeners enjoy what you are saying. Don't make them have to think of what you just said while you are saying something else that is equally if not more amazing then your last bar.  Good luck!"

KendrickLamar,16szja,Kyle_Jackson,3,Fri May 17 20:08:50 2013 UTC,"I thought it was angel dust, especially because of the acronym for m.A.A.d: 'Me, an Angel on Angel Dust'"
KendrickLamar,16szja,ubersaiyan,4,Sun Feb 10 08:15:34 2013 UTC,"It is angel dust, kendrick explains in an interview that the first blunt he ever smoked was laced with PCP i.e. angel dust.   Besides, marijuana laced with coke makes no sense. You can't smoke coke. You smoke crack."
KendrickLamar,16szja,i___explode,4,Mon Feb 11 03:56:31 2013 UTC,"what? yeah you can. the term for a blunt laced with coke is a primo blunt. you can also lick your cigarettes and roll it in cocaine, works too.  your other shit is right but dont get it twisted"
KendrickLamar,16szja,garbage_water,1 point,Sat Mar 2 23:41:29 2013 UTC,"Well ok you CAN smoke anything you want and I'm sure there's all types of words for cocaine-laced blunts and dudes talkin about how high they've gotten from them, but the fact of the matter is trying to smoke cocaine is completely wasteful and won't actually get you high at all besides a numbing sensation to the lips at most.  The melting point of pure cocaine powder, or hydrochloric salt, is 197 degrees (C) and by the time you could get close to reaching that temperature the compound is completely destroyed, and therefore no longer cocaine. Crack was invented to overcome this problem."
