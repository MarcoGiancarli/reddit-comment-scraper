Stargate,3dzih3,busterxmke,24,Mon Jul 20 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"""Midday, the darkness is high in the sky."" You sure about that?"
Stargate,3dzih3,f3n1x03,8,Mon Jul 20 22:41:54 2015 UTC,"See... the thing is that IF I didn't know what ancient ""looks like"" (aka non stargate fan) I would think it just looks like a building where someone fucked up the windows."
Stargate,3dzih3,skpkzk2,7,Tue Jul 21 04:04:04 2015 UTC,well clearly the solution to this problem is to make everyone watch stargate!   *laughs maniacly in a baritone voice as eyes glow*

Stargate,3dzih3,Custard-donut,5,Tue Jul 21 04:48:49 2015 UTC,Through watching Stargate Wormhole X-treme.
Stargate,3dzih3,jrik23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:54:14 2015 UTC,I disagree.  This is what his work would have looked like.
Stargate,3dwzxj,Elephlump,40,Mon Jul 20 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah his name is Amelius, and he's credited as the inventor of the gate, or at least the one who conceptualized the design."
Stargate,3dwzxj,Spinnak3r,18,Mon Jul 20 06:17:44 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks.  I want more of that guy.  More Amelius!!
Stargate,3dwzxj,kavso,72,Mon Jul 20 07:07:17 2015 UTC,I just want more Stargate.
Stargate,3dwzxj,Blueberry49,6,Mon Jul 20 08:18:58 2015 UTC,Story of my life.
Stargate,3dwzxj,FFGFM,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid to want more, I don't want Stargate to turn into a cliche bad-sequels science fiction show :(."
Stargate,3dwzxj,Blueberry49,3,Tue Jul 21 00:03:48 2015 UTC,Yeah. I personally think it's too late for the show to continue. I just wish they had finished it properly.
Stargate,3dwzxj,Manos_Of_Fate,34,Tue Jul 21 00:14:43 2015 UTC,I would watch the hell out of a movie/series about the Ancients' early days in the Milky Way.
Stargate,3dwzxj,Jaraxo,10,Mon Jul 20 10:02:56 2015 UTC,Oh holy hell yes me too!  Maybe a story that leads to Destiny's mission?  Or about building the gate system?  That would be so cool.
Stargate,3dwzxj,Jaraxo,7,Mon Jul 20 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"I think realistically this is the one of the only ways the show could get a reboot. Too many actors are tied up elsewhere with other things for SGU to realistically to get a comeback. SG-1 is finished and doesn't need any more imo, and while a proper SGA end would be nice, I can't see them getting Jason Momoa any time soon.  I think another spin off with an entire new cast is the best bet."
Stargate,3dwzxj,Dev_WldFyre,8,Mon Jul 20 17:24:25 2015 UTC,My Xbox live namesake Alteran_Amelius after this guy.
Stargate,3dwzxj,Spinnak3r,5,Mon Jul 20 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"Was that mentioned in the shows?  I don't remember that, but I'd love to brush up!"
Stargate,3dwzxj,horsenbuggy,4,Mon Jul 20 11:31:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, it might've been mentioned in the film, like another ancient referred to him by name, or Joseph Mollozzi named him in his blog. But no, there was no mention of Amelius SG-1, Atlantis, or SGU. At least in SG-1 they hadn't even encountered the ark yet so there's no way they could've known."
Stargate,3dwzxj,J0ofez,14,Mon Jul 20 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"I'm rewatching too. I just started Atlantis. In the prologue showing how Atlantis takes flight from earth, did they use the same actress that they found frozen in Antarctica? It looked like her."
Stargate,3dwzxj,JMV290,14,Mon Jul 20 11:24:47 2015 UTC,They did! They got Ona Grauer to reprise her role for that one small shot at the beginning of Rising.
Stargate,3dwzxj,horsenbuggy,8,Mon Jul 20 12:01:32 2015 UTC,"Ona Grauer    wow, until I googled her, because I couldn't remember the name of the ancient she played, I didn't realize it was also her who played Young's wife in SGU."
Stargate,3dwzxj,J0ofez,9,Mon Jul 20 13:09:10 2015 UTC,"I don't remember this. But I'm not a fan of them casting ppl who played well known guest roles as different characters in later shows. All the shows exist in the same universe, so someone should notice the similarity. Like, Weir's boyfriend Simon being played by the Tollan who had a crush on Carter. It was nice to see that actor again, but it was just weird that he played a different guy. It would be like Peter Williams or Cliff Simon showing up as Gennai or Athosians."
Stargate,3dwzxj,sugardeath,6,Mon Jul 20 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"Or Mike Dopud popping up as the bounty hunter in SG-1 and later as the Lucian Alliance border in Universe.  Or the same actress that played a young Linea/Ke'ra in Past and Present, and later Ancient Captain Helia in Atlantis.  Or Christopher Heyerdahl as both the guy who lived under the energy dome in Revisions, or as both Halling the Athosian and Todd the Wraith in Atlantis.  OR Steve Bacic as both Major Coburn and Camulus  Or David Palffy as both Sokar and Anubis  Or Dion Johnstone as everyone   et al"
Stargate,3dwzxj,Blueberry49,7,Mon Jul 20 16:27:54 2015 UTC,Or Paul McGillion playing Young Ernest Littlefield in Torment of Tantalus and then playing Doctor Beckett on Atlantis.
Stargate,3dwzxj,JMV290,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:44 2015 UTC,That one made me really happy though. I just really like him.
Stargate,3dwzxj,Delmain,5,Mon Jul 20 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"There was also Jewel Staite as Ellia (the wraith girl) and Dr. Keller in SGA.  Keller was probably a much more major role than all the other examples that are generally people playing multiple  minor characters.  Fortunately, the wraith makeup makes it less obvious."
Stargate,3dwzxj,AsSubtleAsABrick,4,Mon Jul 20 16:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly just that there's (or at least, was at the time) a limit in good actors in the Vancouver area."
Stargate,3dwzxj,speedx5xracer,3,Mon Jul 20 16:39:15 2015 UTC,Also they all know each other and are friends so offer each other small roles in their respective projects.
Stargate,3dwzxj,horsenbuggy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:27 2015 UTC,You must really hate Jeffrey Combs for his roles on star trek then.
Stargate,3dwzxj,SidJenkins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"That Steve Bacic thing made me think I was going crazy during my rewatch. I was like, ""wait, doesn't he later play a fairly important Goa'uld?""   You never really see Anubis' face so I don't mind that one.  And Dion Johnstone... well he's my one exception. I actually wish they'd had a better ""face"" part for him. I always liked him as a regular actor, not just a make up actor."
Stargate,3dwzxj,ForumMMX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:11 2015 UTC,Or Garwin Sanford as the Tolan Narim on SG1 and also as Simon Wallace (Weir's fiancé) on Atlantis.

Stargate,3dwzxj,Loreki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:01:24 2015 UTC,See i like looking out for them all popping up in the different series though and then even in other shows Hyerdahl was also in sg-1 at least once
Stargate,3dwzxj,Tehmuffin19,2,Tue Jul 21 23:50:57 2015 UTC,If you ban it Christopher heyendahl will never work again. He can never just play one role at a time.
Stargate,3dwzxj,samsg1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that threw me off a little and I thought it was supposed to be some kind of backscene secret that some Tollan had survived and we're living double lives on Earth."

Stargate,3dwzxj,horsenbuggy,3,Tue Jul 21 21:23:31 2015 UTC,Why do I feel like I somehow missed this prologue of Atlantis taking flight from Earth?
Stargate,3dwzxj,horsenbuggy,7,Mon Jul 20 12:36:11 2015 UTC,"It's a very brief shot of two Ancients watching as the huge city of Atlantis flies away.  It's labeled as ""millions of years ago.""  When the camera pulls back, you see that they're on earth.  Then you see time shift foward as the earth changes.  The Ancient city where they were standing moves so that it is clearly in Antarctica.  I don't think there's any dialog.  But that's when it hit me that the woman in that little piece was the same person they found frozen in SG-1."

Stargate,3dwzxj,Choreboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:32 2015 UTC,From Joseph Mallozzi's blog:    Destiny is older than Atlantis. In “The Lost City” we come to know that Atlantis is about 30 million years old. The gate aboard Destiny is older than the ones in the Milky Way. In “Frozen” we come to know that the gates in the Mily Way are about 50 million years old.
Stargate,3dwzxj,nowonderimstillawake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"Mmmmmmm but they specifically said how long Destiny had been traveling on the show. The Stargate Wikia even mentions it being ""a million years old"", although the characters (Rush) were just rounding."
Stargate,3dwzxj,Choreboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"From Stargate Wiki:   Destiny is a ship in the Ancient fleet, constructed and launched over 50 million years ago from Earth.[5] The Ancients launched several automated ships prior to Destiny, each with the purpose of constructing and seeding Stargates throughout the numerous galaxies they crossed, with Destiny itself planned to follow in their path to explore those planets. After beginning this process, the Ancients initially planned to wait until the ship reached a sufficient distance from Earth to board it. However, because of other endeavors, such as ascension, they never followed through on the plan. Because of this, Destiny has continued on a pre-programmed path on its journey throughout the stars, alone, for millions of years.   http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Destiny"
Stargate,3dwzxj,horsenbuggy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"From Stargate Wiki:   However, Rush doesn't think so; since Destiny is a million years old, it could only charge up to 40% its original capacity, and that if they could have the power to dial Earth, it would be thousands of years ago.   http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Water%20(episode)"

Stargate,3dzpef,PodkayneIsBadWolf,5,Mon Jul 20 21:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend SG-1 and Atlantis based on purely being good television. They're definitely different than Universe though. Oh, and the obligatory don't judge SG-1 too hastily as the quality isn't as high at the start, especially the first half of the first season. The characters and plots aren't as good as what you'll see later. Takes a bit to find its stride."
Stargate,3dzpef,Lurkerlisk,5,Mon Jul 20 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"SG-1 and Atlantis are more campy, and they tend to be episodic versus the more serialized SGU format. So for the most part, each episode of SG-1 and Atlantis have their own primary plot, and there's a much lighter style to the overall story.  That being said, even though I prefer dark and gritty, I still adore SG-1 and Atlantis."
Stargate,3dzpef,Spinnak3r,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you like lighthearted campy episodic sci-fi that is sometimes a bit too comical and surreal to be real:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtTeN4XDM0k  As far as as campy lighthearted sci-fi goes, it's legitimately quite good."
Stargate,3dxrep,saryos,3,Mon Jul 20 12:13:19 2015 UTC,"I like how it seemed like they had more planning in season 2 with a tok'ra story arc. First you had Jolinar appear in the 2nd episode, then you actually had Jacob introduced with his illness in an earlier episode than the tok'ra 2-parter to lead into it."
Stargate,3dxrep,shongage,3,Mon Jul 20 15:22:12 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about their starting the ancient arc so early.
Stargate,3dxrep,jlevy1126,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:08 2015 UTC,Especially since they were locked into the launguage they established from the first season. Cool to see.

Stargate,3dxrep,Evis-Cerate,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:50 2015 UTC,"While I think the Tok'ra were necessary, I was always very frustrated with them. The exception being Jacob/Selmak. The others seemed to constantly deny us aid or supplies, yet they would always come to us with intel on something the Goa'uld were up to and needed to be stopped, and expected us to be their grunts. So we'd pull off a success somehow, and they would never really acknowledge it with any kind of compensation.  Anise, while smoking hot, almost seemed to treat us like guinea pigs or just expendable pawns in the Tok'ra cosmic chess match with the Goa'uld."
Stargate,3dxrep,nubsauce87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:04 2015 UTC,I think the Tok'ra was one of the worst additions to be honest.
Stargate,3dxrep,Evis-Cerate,6,Mon Jul 20 14:47:46 2015 UTC,I think I disagree. The universe isn't filled with just good and bad. I think it's nice to have an ally that was in that grey area. They arguably caused about as much good as they did bad and the struggle to work with them and their stubborn culture was good storytelling.  We needed help in the fight and someone holding our hand would have been boring.

Stargate,3dtfti,EvTheSmev,11,Sun Jul 19 08:16:25 2015 UTC,It is a wound closing first aid thing which you apply inside the mouth in some way. It is some kind of glue which you smear over the injured skin.  And the name is Urgo which refers to Urgo - the small annoying voice in the head of SG1 in one episode.

Stargate,3drjwp,NordicParadox,14,Sat Jul 18 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"They certainly have some sort of intranet, and I think at some point they interfaced it with Atlantis' systems. Since they were interfacing their computers in the gate room and the medical bay, they probably were able to network that way. As far as communicating with Earth goes, the only way they can do so is with the gate. Aside from radio communication, they can send data bursts like they did in ""Letters from Pegasus""."
Stargate,3drjwp,Spinnak3r,6,Sat Jul 18 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"I think they set up a network. I vaguely remember them initially laying cables around. I assume they eventually either tapped into an ancient system, or ran cables in the walls in a similar fashion to what the ancients would have done"
Stargate,3drjwp,CityOfWin,3,Sat Jul 18 20:04:17 2015 UTC,maybe but that seems abit of work. I think the ancents had intercity comm i a way(pretty sure they were smart :) ).
