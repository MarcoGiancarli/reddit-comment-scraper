DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,ITS_JUST_LOW_T,5,Tue Jul 21 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"There have been a few players who are elite in the AHL and then has nothing to show for in the NHL i hope this is not the case for Pulk but if there ever was a guy who would give Pulk everything he needs to be successful its Blashill. With Babcock i think Pulks days would be numbered, he would struggle for the start of the season and end up in Babs doghouse."
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,big_phat_gator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:27 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go ahead and assume you're talking about Brunner. Worst case it's only 735k in cap space. I would take Brunner for that price. It's pretty unlikely that he will under perform that number. The only real concern is that you give him a solid contract because of AHL performance and then you're stuck with him. This contract is basically risk-free for the wings.
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,sleepdepriveddev,3,Tue Jul 21 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"Meh, just look at some of the AHL scoring leaders over the years and you can see there are a few who scored a ton in the AHL and then did nothing at the big stage, like this guy http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=7305 or this guy http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=7963 | list here http://theahl.com/stats/statdisplay.php?type=top_scorers&subType=0&season_id=16&league_id=4&division_id=-1&confId=0"
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,sleepdepriveddev,3,Tue Jul 21 22:03:28 2015 UTC,"For how much? Did he only do it for one year since the cap is tight right now and he could potentially get a longer, more yielding contract in a year?"
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,sleepdepriveddev,5,Tue Jul 21 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"Will update, don't know yet Probably a decent assumption, but he's also probably ""betting on himself"" the same way Mrazek did last year (kinda) and believes he will get a better deal after producing this upcoming year"

DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,MonsieurAK,5,Tue Jul 21 17:22:34 2015 UTC,735k at 1 year what a deal.
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,7screws,8,Tue Jul 21 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"Let's hope it wasn't for much. He was not impressive during his time in Detroit. After his two goal game in March he had two points the entire rest of the season.  I know he could grow still, but he's not NHL caliber yet and may never be. The slapshot alone isn't enough."
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,TyPiper93,0,Tue Jul 21 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"It takes time, but I agree he did disappear at the NHL level.  I believe he will spend time on the 3rd line, playing with Sheahan and like Helm or Jurco and he will adjust and improve throughout the season."
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,Pituophis,6,Tue Jul 21 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"That's the one thing I love about the Wings that a lot of people here don't always seem to. That development time in Grand Rapids does pay off, and we're not so desperate for talent that rushing someone into the NHL would make a difference.  Keep him as depth, maybe give him time in Grand Rapids, and maybe he'll be worthy of that permanent roster slot yet. Right now I'm not even sure I'd give him a fourth line slot over some of our other young guys, though depending on his training camp that could easily change."
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,TyPiper93,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm not even sure I'd give him a fourth line slot over some of our other young guys, though depending on his training camp that could easily change.   Are you talking about Pulkkinen?  Because if you are.. Holland already said that he was going to be one of the 14 forwards on the Wing's roster (and he isn't waiver exempt so there goes the GR idea.)  Also, What other young guys would you give a shot over pulkkinen?  Pulu was the best player in the AHL last season.. he will more than likely play on the 3rd line for us this year."
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,MF26,7,Tue Jul 21 17:42:40 2015 UTC,Pulkkinen is no longer waiver eligible. The other 29 teams would be falling over each other to claim him.
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,Caboose119z,2,Tue Jul 21 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"if anyone is going to get something out of him its going to be Blash, so its all or nothing this year for him I think"
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,DDKs_flow,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But he's still young with a lot of room for improvement/potiental. Not to mention last year, Pulks was in the Babcock system. This year he'll be in Blash's, exactly where he was when he soared. Of course, that's not entirely because of Balshill, but it's certainly a factor. That and it was his first year."
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,svdcore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"The Babcock system had nothing to do with his slow wind-up, his constant beaver-tailing alerting the defense to his location, his difficulty finding open space, and his Jason Williams-esque penchant for missing the net. He can't continue to do that stuff at the NHL level, irrespective of the system. He soared in the AHL. That wasn't Blash's system. That was the Red Wings system.   I hope you're right and that he has a lot of room for improvement. But from what I saw from him in the NHL last season, I have a lot of concerns."
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,AlkarinValkari,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:43 2015 UTC,The issues you pointed out him having are issues that coaches can correct in a player. Just saying...
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,BuffaloSoldier11,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:03 2015 UTC,If the player is willing to correct them. You can only lead the horse to water.
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,BuffaloSoldier11,3,Tue Jul 21 21:18:44 2015 UTC,To be fair his linemates were frequently Weiss and Andersson. When he was with Sheahan it was on him though I agree.
DetroitRedWings,3e3cji,svdcore,4,Tue Jul 21 17:59:03 2015 UTC,"If someone needs a really big season it's Pulk. Last season he really look like a one trick pony out there and one that couldn't pull off the trick in the big league. He just doesn't have the time and space to wind up that big slapper, he wasn't good at protecting the puck, he wasn't fast, he's not a big guy and he can't really do much defensively. As bad as I want him to succeed I'm having a hard time seeing it happen if he isn't a whole lot better at the start of the season than he was at the end of last season."

None of my buds ever believe me when I tell them that I saw one of his first games for the Wings and he was rocking this number. It was a preseason game against Montreal in 2001. He was so tiny, but you could tell he was going to be a good player. My friend's dad and I spent almost the whole game saying ""Who the hell is this guy?"""

DetroitRedWings,3dz526,imagolddinosaur,13,Mon Jul 20 18:35:43 2015 UTC,"So many people in this subreddit don't understand how amazing it is that he came in 4th in scoring this season. He's been one of my favorite players for the past two years.  Interestingly enough, even though we've seen him for awhile now and we're kind of used to him... Ponder this. He was drafted 10 years ago.  He was a natural goal scoring power forward for his short AHL and college stint.  He's been put into a grinding role his entire NHL career, basically. Rounding him out. Polishing his defensive game.  We put him in the top6, and he puts up career numbers, earns a fraction of what other people capable of 20g a season earns, and has a huge leadership presence. Devious. Utterly devious.  Jurco 5 years from now, anyone?"
DetroitRedWings,3dz526,Aural21,7,Tue Jul 21 01:15:45 2015 UTC,We better be able to keep him and Helmer after next season.

DetroitRedWings,3dz526,BeardedNino,3,Tue Jul 21 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"It is a hard choice, but at this point you are right. Unless Helm can have the same kind of jump in scoring Abby had last season."
DetroitRedWings,3dz526,BillMaher4President,4,Tue Jul 21 02:15:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, not to say helm isn't valuable.. I just value abby's size and presence more... I think we have more 'helm-esque' players than 'abby-esque' players in the system"
DetroitRedWings,3dz526,BeardedNino,7,Tue Jul 21 02:33:18 2015 UTC,One of the most important guys on the team. I want to see Abby with a big-time leadership role in the coming years.

DetroitRedWings,3dybce,BeardedNino,2,Mon Jul 20 16:15:27 2015 UTC,I definitely think he'll get it one day permanently.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,Blobbles890,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:18:00 2015 UTC,One day:  Goose - C  Tats - A  DDK - A
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,BeardedNino,15,Mon Jul 20 15:18:57 2015 UTC,I've never heard of Nyquist being a good leader or lead by example guy. There's many players ahead of him on the letter chart.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,CommodorePastrami,6,Mon Jul 20 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably difficult being a big voice in the locker room with Dats, Z, Kronner, ect. in there as well.  I was talking more down the road, with those guys gone, guys like goose/tats/ddk will step in and be the voices of the team.  Although, I think Larkin has a fair shot at being the C eventually, too."
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,spoonfedkyle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:35 2015 UTC,"Nyquist doesn't seem like a leadership type of guy. To be fair, neither does Datsyuk, but he's the best lead by example guy in the league. I don't see Nyquist getting any more than an A."
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,JDSchu,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I got lots of hate for that comment above.. but just because people ""don't see it"" or ""have never heard of him doing it"" or whatever (no offense, like you said.. dats doesn't seem like it either) doesn't mean he can't be one of the ones to step up when the vets leave and really lead this team.. it was just an opinion anyways."
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,JDSchu,4,Tue Jul 21 11:06:11 2015 UTC,Ericsson or Helm.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,JDSchu,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:44 2015 UTC,Helm or Abdelkader hopefully.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,snotbowst,7,Mon Jul 20 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"Other candidates:  Jonathan Ericsson  Drew Miller  Kyle Quincey  Those are in order of who I think would end up with the A next.  This all assuming that Dan Cleary isn't back again, of course."
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,TyPiper93,4,Mon Jul 20 15:11:18 2015 UTC,Could also put Helm on that list.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,JDSchu,4,Mon Jul 20 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Helm for sure. I think the other three guys all had an A at some point last season. I'm all but sure that Riggy and the Quince did, and if Miller didn't, he darn well should have. Helm is another great candidate given his leadership."
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,TyPiper93,3,Mon Jul 20 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"Miller and Helm would definitely be great options, only problem with Helm is if he gets i*****d."
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,Kysersose,2,Mon Jul 20 15:25:35 2015 UTC,There was a while where I wasn't sure he'd ever come back. He's been doing much better recently though (knocks on wood). Miller is a gosh dang iron man. We can count on him for at least 82 games a season.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,DeliSammiches,3,Mon Jul 20 15:27:23 2015 UTC,Ericsson wore it briefly last season.  He will probably take it again.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,BillMaher4President,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:38 2015 UTC,I'd put Helm and Abs WAY before Quincey and certainly before Ericsson. I think Miller deserves it the most though.
DetroitRedWings,3dybce,rwitucki,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. I'm just going based on the fact that I'm certain Ericsson and Quincey both wore an A last season during at least one game, and I'm not sure Miller did. Abs and Helm definitely did not."

Idk I forget, but I think it was basically in order of seniority.   I have no idea what Blashill will do, but if it's the same as Babcock I would imagine Ericsson gets the A.   I'd like to see Helm/ Abby/ DDK with it, personally. Maybe Glendening as a dark horse."

Flight was delayed THREE times, ended up getting to see the entire game, hunched over my phone, anchored to wall outlet sitting on the terminal floor. I was the only passenger out of 136 stuck in that godforsaken terminal that was so happy! People were looking at me like, ""what the fuck is he watching?"" It was the best of times."
DetroitRedWings,3dvaga,blueorcawhale,10,Sun Jul 19 20:35:09 2015 UTC,This goal was the embodiment of how Igor played. Only a few players would have the patience that he did there. The professor was magic on the ice.
DetroitRedWings,3dvaga,Troub313,4,Sun Jul 19 20:36:17 2015 UTC,"Someone told me when I was a kid that I reminded them of a fast Igor Larionov in the way that I played the game. All the other kids wanted to be Fedorov or some sort of flashy player of that time. I wanted to be Igor Larionov, you could just see him on the ice. It was like a fine chess move with everything he did, he just saw the play going on around him like no one else saw it and saw what was going to transpire 3 moves ahead of them. It was the greatest compliment I had ever received at the time and I still remember it to this day."

What I quickly noticed about the Russian skaters is they use the whole skate blade. Like how Larionov moved his weight to the middle of the skate then turned back inside. Fedorov and Kozlov were really good at it too. The downside is if anyone bumps you while you're doing it you're going flat on your ass. But hot damn is it effective if you pull it off. Even my bumbling ass could juke a much more experienced defenseman using that technique. I can only imagine how hard it was to adjust to someone doing it with real speed."

DetroitRedWings,3dw9wt,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Mon Jul 20 03:45:09 2015 UTC,"Larkin demonstrated he can adapt to a high level of play and in the spotlight at worlds IMO. AA - as much as I'd like to see him get some NHL exposure, I'm not sure 32 points in the minors is what I'd call NHL ready. Though he did have a fairly strong playoffs statistically. One more year of development with some NHL preseason to whet his appetite might be what he needs. It'll be nice having Blash making these calls knowing who's who. I miss hockey."
DetroitRedWings,3dw9wt,steelcitykid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:16:08 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% on board the Larkin hype train but let's remember he has played just 6 games in the AHL and had 5 points (3G, 2A). I agree he showed he can adapt to a high level very quickly in the world juniors and the AHL but the AHL is a far cry from the NHL in terms of talent and skill level.  If he makes it on the team out of training camp I'll 100% believe in him and the coaching staff. If he doesn't then I'll still be extremely excited about his future but I'll be looking for him to continue the production he started in the playoffs last season.  It is really hard for a prospect to make the Wings roster out of training camp. Especially for centers when we technically have five that will be in the starting lineup for the first game. Those five are Zetterberg, Sheahan, Richards, Helm, and Glendening.  I am extremely excited for Larkin but I also don't want to throw him into the fire before we know he's ready if we don't need to. I'm not saying to over ripen him like we have other prospects, just make sure he's ready.  I'd rather see...  Abdelkader - Zetterberg - Nyquist  Tatar - Sheahan - Jurco  Helm - Richards - Pulkinnen  Miller - Glendening - Ferrandersson  to start the season if the coaches don't think Larkin is ready.  I think I've digressed a little bit though since your point was about Larkin over Athanasiou. I think to that end I'd rather see both start in GR and whichever is playing the best at the time we could call someone up that's the one I'd rather see. Either way I see them both getting big boy squad minutes this season. Which is great cause then I can get my Larkin jersey!  TL;DR: I miss hockey too...which is why this response is so long..."
DetroitRedWings,3dw9wt,Brady_Hokes_Headset,3,Mon Jul 20 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"4-6 weeks is what they said originally, though they did say it would likely be longer for a full recovery, but 4-5 months is a hell of a difference from 4-6 weeks.  Edit* Only plus is it gives Larkin a legit opportunity to make the team right away."

DetroitRedWings,3dsoxw,RelentlessNick10,2,Sun Jul 19 03:56:57 2015 UTC,"Franzen is likely done, so he'll be on LTIR for a while, most likely the rest of his contract. We could also easily move Kindl or Smith."

DetroitRedWings,3dpk0v,Para_Para,16,Sat Jul 18 05:18:05 2015 UTC,My mom had this picture taken in the mid 50's with Marty Pavelich and Red Kelly.  She survived polio and was lucky to skate with these handsome fellows.  I know they are aging and may not be in contact anymore....   Can anyone tell me how I could contact them or their agents to maybe get a letter or message sent to her for her birthday coming up in September?  It would mean the world to her.

Usually people don't expect a written reply and just try to get a couple cards signed and send a nice letter, but if you tell them the story and send a copy of that photo (not the original incase it gets lost) I wouldn't be surprised if you receive a letter.  Just be sure to send a self addressed stamped envelope with it.  Red Kelly 30 Dunvegen Rd.

DetroitRedWings,3dmpdn,justjoeoc,9,Sat Jul 18 14:33:07 2015 UTC,I've got a two-part comment here..  TIL Ozzie was selected 1st in the Waiver Draft.  and  ELI5 the Waiver Draft.
DetroitRedWings,3dmpdn,BeardedNino,13,Fri Jul 17 15:41:08 2015 UTC,"They held a draft every year before the regular season got started. Each team could protect 18 skaters and 2 goalies from their active roster and teams picked in reverse-standings order. It was basically just another way of redistributing talent throughout the league and a way for teams to possibly get higher salary guys off of their roster, kind of similar to the expansion draft. They just completely got rid of it after the lockout though, because in the new CBA players could hit free agency earlier so there wasn't as much need to disperse talent throughout the league."

DetroitRedWings,3dmpdn,Decaf_Engineer,8,Fri Jul 17 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"I'm obviously biased, but I gotta think he's gonna get in.  2 Cups, 3 Selkes, 4 Lady Bings, etc  But he's been incredibly unique in what he can do.  The stickhandling is something pretty much unseen before.  The massive amount of takeaways.  Great play on both ends.  Being an insanely skilled, smaller, ""european"", winner of the Lady Bing....who absolutely knocks people on their asses.  And that great fight with Perry, etc.  He was absolutely the best defensive forward in the league while still putting up 97 points.  If he wasn't such a complete 2-way guy, he could've put up bigger numbers and probably would've helped him with Hart contention.  But I think, ironically enough, being so good and responsible defensively made it harder for him to get the respect in the MVP conversation.  Can't really quantify backchecking, tying players up, being in passing lanes, etc. and takeaways don't carry enough weight----despite he fact that he'd often be in the lead by comical amounts.  #3 guy would have like 85, #2 would have 97, and Pav would be at 136 or something.   Just amazing.....magic, even."

Sure he wasn't Hasek but he was better than Legace and Osgood during that period. The issue is he was very expensive and goaltending wasn't the issue in 2003. Fedorov was the only player on the entire team to show up against Anaheim. No one else had any idea how to score on Giguere.   Curtis Joesph had absolutely no chance to succeed in this city."

Combination of: - Cost to them for on-air talent and production   Not enough money willing to be paid for advertising slots It ranks below NFL/NBA/MLB/NCAA BB/NCAA FB in national interest They don't want to pay $210 million per year to air games like NBC is doing for all the reasons above as well   The NHL is a great product but they just don't see the economic returns they want out of it.

DetroitRedWings,3dmvid,WingWheeler44,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:09:07 2015 UTC,I hope they never do.  Their streaming policy is basically the 4th Reich in action.  You have to have cable to even use it.  I'm happy with NBC Live and Game Center.  If ESPN covered the games the only way you would ever be able to stream games would be on their app with cable tv subscription.  This is the main reason I can't watch MSU football anymore.
DetroitRedWings,3dmvid,punkrawkintrev,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:17:46 2015 UTC,"Most people think its a very logical monetary explanation, but that can easily be silenced by the hours of tennis, wrestling, bowling, curling, and other bullshit sports that make the daily ESPN loop. The real reason actually has some Red Wings ties. When the Red Wings faced the Avalanche and took it to game seven in the playoffs (maybe '02?), this was the year that the NHL signed with Versus to cover most of the regular and post season. That game 7 with the Avalanche ended up being the most watch hockey game in history at the time and ESPN was pretty outspoken about how they felt the NHL screwed them out of the contract.  They haven't had a decent coverage since."
DetroitRedWings,3dmvid,bchiz10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:37:57 2015 UTC,"Nobody has given you a good answer. Let's imagine you are dating someone for a real long time. Your relationship was honest, but after awhile you just kept getting pushed back even further. You finally decide that there are other fish in the sea. NHL and ESPN offer another chance but instead of feeling loved, there other things that are going to take precedent over you..( ESPN pushes NHL  to espn3) A new person (NBC) comes around and they are going to make you the spotlight and tell you how they will deliver. It was important that they (Comcast) did because they were shopping for other leagues too.  Eventually, Comcast and NBC got really together and OLN which became Versus which became NBCSN. Ultimately, NHL wanted to grow the game and while ESPN was the place to be, it was a fit that only benefitted ESPN and (I think) would have hurt the NHL. While there is a desire to get back on ESPN, only if they are given a few games a week at prime time would it be worth it. ESPN has jumped back in and will host the World Cup of hockey, but it is more that ESPN needs to make it worth it and I don't think they will."
