chicagobulls,3e31j7,iChoke,0,Tue Jul 21 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's done ""a lot"" other than be a stable presence for a team that needed one coming off of the bizarre 99-03 stretch the Bulls went through.   He was never really great, probably never the best player on any team.  As for an ""all-time"" Bull, he just isn't. I guess statistically he'll go down as a great player because he's played for longer than almost anyone, but when you talk about the great Bulls players mentioning Kirk as anything other than an afterthought is a joke."
chicagobulls,3e31j7,tendychicken15,3,Tue Jul 21 19:58:29 2015 UTC,Sorry but that is just not right. Kirk might not be food for big minutes now but at his peak you could  have made a case for top ten pg in the league. His stats (other than three point shooting) might not show it that much but Kirk was an absolute cornerstone and not mentioning him in all time bulls convoy is just straight up disrespectful.
chicagobulls,3e31j7,McNasti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:10 2015 UTC,"3 year peak. 04-07. Why should I care that during even that stretch he was arguably a top 10 point guard(and when we say top 10, we mean a lot closer to 10 that 5)? That doesn't automatically make him a franchise all time great. That means he was an above average NBA player during that span.  He was, at best, the second(and probably closer to third) best player on mediocre to average(and one above average) Bulls teams. That doesn't make him great.   He brought consistency to a team that seriously needed it. That's good. But he's not an all time great. He's a borderline top 10 player for a franchise that's pretty top heavy in all time greats."

chicagobulls,3e31j7,sadale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:28 2015 UTC,I love Kirk but Rose would start and Sloan would back him up.  MJ would challenge Rose to play so hard his MVP season would look bad.
chicagobulls,3e31j7,jwjmaster,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"If u think about it.. With mj starting, you don't need a rose on the floor. You need a selfless backcourt shooter. If Jordan can't make a play he dishes out and kirk slams the 3 or resets the offense and dishes to a big. Rose is the bench mob pg now and runs the floor when Jordan's not there. In kirks prime he was 10x better than what we were seeing this last year or two"

chicagobulls,3e30td,alba7or,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:41 2015 UTC,Because a lot of NBA players train in LA during the summer and they like to practice & train with/against each other.

chicagobulls,3e36gd,roseyrosey,16,Tue Jul 21 16:35:44 2015 UTC,This is honestly the most knee-jerk team sub that I am subscribed to.   Just remember there are also people on this sub who think we should sign Ramon Galloway and Vander Blue. Their opinions don't really mean much.
chicagobulls,3e36gd,AB444,5,Tue Jul 21 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"the knee-jerking is very frustrating.  I actually kind of left RealGM and starting coming here more because I had originally found it less knee-jerky and pessimistic, this offseason though has been rough."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,AGoodWordForOldGil,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:01 2015 UTC,Its ridiculous. We have an entirely new offensive system and people are asking the FO to add players just for the hell of it. The FO doesn't even know what the team will need. How can you sign a free agent if you're not certain he'll fit your team's needs. Its irresponsible to do that but that's exactly what all these filthy casuals want the Bulls to do. Sign JLIN! Start Bobby Portis! Fuck it bring back Pippen! I try not to let the idiots on here bother me but they do.
chicagobulls,3e36gd,alba7or,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"Every offseason around here is pretty rough, we're working on trying to improve that though."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,kinnaston,12,Tue Jul 21 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"I think the Bulls are hoping that something similar to the Golden State situation happens in Chicago. Golden State fans last offseason were clamoring to trade for Kevin Love even if it meant losing Klay Thompson. That for them might have been a disaster because then Draymond Green never would have had a chance to excel. They changed the coach, developed from within and won the championship. The similarities are a little silly between the two teams when you think about it:  Both are led by MVP-winning point guards (Rose and Curry). Both have excellent 2-way shooting guards (Butler and Thompson). Both have playmaking 4s (Mirotic and Green). Both have injury-hobbled, defense-first centers (Noah and Bogut). And both have deep benches filled with plenty of shooting.  Both were led by defense-minded coaches who could only carry the team so far (Thibodeau and Jackson). And both gained offense-minded, ball-moving coaches (Kerr and Hoiberg).  I'm not saying the same magic will happen to Chicago. I hope it will. But I think the front office sees the similarities in their position to Golden State and believes their best chance to win the championship is to build on their success and failure from last year and grow.  While I wanted the Bulls to select a wing, like Hunter or Rondae-Hollis, Portis could be a gamechanging selection if he continues to develop (he's only 20!). He unlocks a lot of Hoiberg's playbook, especially the 5-out plays that gave Golden State success against Cleveland."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,rowseyna,5,Tue Jul 21 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, most people are undervaluing the Bulls off-season.  Overall, it was definitely a success."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,sbaker93,0,Tue Jul 21 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"If you stay exactly the same when all the title contenders in the West improved through free agency pick ups and the Warriors got the gang back together how do you consider that a successful off season? I apologize if that comes off as rude. I genuinely didn't think we had a good offseason, and I'm curious about your perspective. I understand in a vacuum how you could say our team is good, but relative to other teams (e.g. rockets, clips) who remedied many of their weaknesses over free agency we fell behind."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,rowseyna,2,Tue Jul 21 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"Our team didn't stay exactly the same.  We have a new HC, the addition of Bobby Portis, and each player has an added year of experience and chemistry with one another.  Also, all the contenders in the West didn't get better.  Some did.  Some got worse.  Some didn't change much.  It's successful because we retained the best player we had who could have potentially gotten away.  What if we would have lost Jimmy Butler or not secured him long term?  Securing him for the future is huge.  Additionally, we re-signed MDJ who could have definitely taken more money elsewhere.  Again, would our team have been better had we lost him?  Were we likely to improve by letting him go and trying to replace him elsewhere?  No.  Retaining him was huge.  Teams like the Rockets and Clippers were already as or more flawed than we were.  The way they play won't be appreciably different from last year whereas our style should be considerably different.  Don't underestimate that.  Additionally, those teams don't have the young stable of players that we do who should expect appreciable growth this coming season.  Guys like Derrick Rose, Nikola Mirotic, Doug McDermott, and Tony Snell should all be much better than they were last year.  Our primary weaknesses the past couple of years have been offensive system and health.  As of this moment, the whole team is healthy aside from Taj Gibson.  Regardless of overall coaching ability, Fred Hoiberg should be a better offensive coach with a better offensive system than Tom Thibodeau.  I'd say we've improved both of our primary weaknesses and honestly, what significant weaknesses does this team have?  I don't really see any."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,sbaker93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I agree that the top priority was to resign MDJ and Butler. I just thought that getting a replacement PG should have been a higher priority also because of Rose's injury history. He is going to miss games, maybe 15ish this year, and I don't think Brooks is a suitable backup. He's too small and it really brings up issues when we face teams like the Bucks. I seemed to think we were older than the other title contenders, but it looks like we're practically the same the age as the warriors according to realgm. I consider the rockets and clips to be as good if not a little better than the bulls last year on paper because of their better records in a more difficult conference and/or the fact they advanced further in the playoffs. The rockets major flaw was lacking a facilitator/scoring threat at the point, which ty is more than capable of doing. And the clippers major weakness was lacking depth, which they've also addressed. I think our major issue is that we run the offense through a guy who is injured every season, and don't have a quality back up PG (though I understand that may be a point of debate). I hope I'm wrong, and Hoidberg can work some magic. I'm just not very optimistic at the moment."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,Guidonculous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"There are two major camps of bulls fans right now. Those who think we lost last year because our coach refused to play to our talent,  and those who believe that we didn't have enough talent to get past lebron.   I personally think the second opinion is rather silly. We had way, way more talent than Cleveland last year, especially considering injuries, and Thibs ignored almost all of it, and didn't maximize the talent of a single player except maybe Gibson. I don't see how any of the free agents available would've substantially improve our team. I don't think the wings we could've drafted would've outplayed McDermott or snell for playing time this year, and long term we needed another big to replace our aging bigs way more than we needed another wing.   We may have improved a whole lot this offseason if hoiberg gets us to stop slowing the game down, and taking heaved shots with under 4 seconds left on the shot clock. Hell, he could even be good for our defense if he lets our athletes occasionally get out of position to get in the passing lanes a bit.   Last year, our best game, by far, was when we beat golden state at home. If you watch that game, it was one of the only times in Thib's career where we let Rose just sprint and had very few possessions last more than 14 seconds. The GS announcers were confused the whole game waiting for us to return to our roots and start walking the ball up the court. We didn't, and we won.   Hoiberg may be a bust, but that's where our big change occurred, and it's exactly where I thought the change was needed."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,redd1t4l1fe,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"No one on this sub is saying that the returning cast isn't awesome, they certainly are a ton of really great players.  But it's off season and what does it hurt to speculate every possible scenario that ""could"" potentially happen.  It's all in good fun and more about passing the time than really predicting what the Bulls next move is gonna be.  News flash to the guys talking down about all the random posts, you don't know either!  Maybe we will pick up Prigioni (lol), and if not who cares?   What's a bigger waste of time? Discussing dream scenarios and having fun speculating OR bitching about people on here coming up with (mostly improbable) chance scenarios.  I'd have to say the first one is all in good fun, so it gets a pass.  And all you people bitching:  go outside, get some fresh air, and shut the fuck up.  Because who really cares???"
chicagobulls,3e36gd,ThisIsSomeGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:24 2015 UTC,I am not sure what people expected. Other than lose guys I don't think the Bulls could have done anything more than what they did. Maybe they could have gotten a different backup point guard for the minimum other than Brooks.
chicagobulls,3e36gd,TianDogg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem with the offseason: we are putting a LOT of our hopes on health (never happens) and internal development (iffy).  Don't get me wrong, re-signing Jimmy and MDJ are the right moves. As for Brooks, I don't understand why we had to pay him part of the MMLE. AFAIK there was no one else bidding on him, so he probably could have gotten the vet min AND we'd have the MMLE for someone else.  The problem is we still don't have a good backup PG, and we still need wing help. Hinrich is done as a player and should not get much PT outside of garbage time. Backup PG is especially important to the Bulls because if Rose misses time, that guy will have to start and provide ballhandling.  As for the wings, we have the same set of hopes that Snell/McDermott will improve. But I find it unlikely that either of them will get to Dunleavy's level this coming season, and hell Dunleavy himself is no spring chicken.  So although standing pat is not a bad move by the FO, they haven't really done anything to address our needs outside of getting a new coach.  Also I don't buy the argument that just because we're capped out, it means there are no moves to be made. There are always trades to be explored, and we have almost $30M in salary between Pau, Taj, and Noah (also, plenty of filler contracts). We can shuffle around this salary for depth at other positions."
chicagobulls,3e36gd,Doug_McDermott,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:11 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem with some (again some) of your argument here.  You can't mention the health problems the team has had then say we should have traded away some of our front court depth.    Of the front court guys you mentioned two are coming off injury riddled season, significantly lowering their value.  Noah's got 1 year left on his deal, nobody's going to give anything worthwhile for a player that's coming off a bad season due to injury, could leave in a year, or on the flip side if he bounces back this year they can simply try to get him as a free agent next summer.  Similar situation with Taj where there's little to no chance we get back fair value due to recent injury.    As far as I know no one else was bidding on Brooks either, but I also had no idea Charlotte was going after Lin, or that the Hawks were pursuing Holiday, etc. etc.    Here's the free agent point guards that changed teams we could have afforded: * Ronnie Price * Justin Holiday * Jeremy Lin * Gary Neal * Shane Larkin    Here's the point guards still out there: * Dellavedova (RFA) * John Lucas 3 * Jason Terry * Norris Cole (RFA) * Jimmer * Ish Smith * Andre Miller * Will Bynum    So instead of the hypothetical better option, please let me know who from these lists you would have preferred."

chicagobulls,3dzw7p,OnePieceAce,9,Mon Jul 20 23:12:11 2015 UTC,What was shaq saying
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,kyrish,6,Mon Jul 20 21:53:53 2015 UTC,A team of the best Lakers would beat a team of the best Bulls by 50.
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,ReplaceSelect,13,Mon Jul 20 22:40:44 2015 UTC,"IDK, I think I'd put the 95-96 Bulls against any anything. The team was 72-10. Think about that for a second.    No other team in professional sports has been that dominant. That's some other-level stuff right there and they didn't need best-Bulls-of-all-time, they had the best-Bulls-of-all-time in 95-96!"
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,ChiefStickybags,13,Tue Jul 21 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, though, a team with Shaq, Kareem, Elgin Baylor, Kobe, and Magic would be pretty fucking nasty."
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,maxelrod,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"The Lakers would have a cray bench too.  I wouldn't bet against MJ, but the Lakers would have a more talented roster."
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,ReplaceSelect,2,Tue Jul 21 02:18:50 2015 UTC,"Plus, Rose is clearly our best PG, but I foresee chemistry issues between him and MJ."
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,maxelrod,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"How so? Rose is about as humble as they come and having grown up during the Jordan 90's he would basically be in awe of Michael and would concede to anything his Airness wanted him to do on the court. I just think of any great PG, Rose would be most able to show deference to the greats.  I mean if chemistry issues are going to be a problem here, then I would argue that chemistry issues would absolutely drown that Lakers roster. Particularly between Magic and Kobe."
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,funfsinn14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:00 2015 UTC,They're both too ball-dominant. I think Magic is a good enough facilitator to make the chemistry work between himself and Kobe.
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,maxelrod,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I'm thinking more along the lines of attitude and personality. Rose has been ball-dominant because he's been the best player on the team. I think that changes as soon as he's surrounded by better scorers (and probably will change in real life now with Butler likely overtaking him pretty soon). Who knows"
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,funfsinn14,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:26 2015 UTC,Nasty yes.  But there is only one ball.  And there is only one MJ.
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,czah7,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"I'm probably taking the Lakers, but it would be close."
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,maxelrod,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"No, it was like all time best teams. I think it was like Magic/Kobe/Baylor/Shaq/KAJ vs Rose/Jordan/Pippen/Rodman/Grant.  I'd take the Lakers but 10/10 comeback from Scottie on this one."
chicagobulls,3dzw7p,_masterofdisaster,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:07 2015 UTC,against any anything.   There's gotta be at least one anything that would give them a real fight.

chicagobulls,3dzw7p,ChicagoRunner,4,Tue Jul 21 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the undefeated Dolphins still only won 16 games.    The Yankees definitely had some dominant, impressive teams and MAYBE a contender, but even still winning 2/3 of your games is not as impressive as the 86% win rate those bulls posted."

chicagobulls,3e1lye,jonesb32,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"And I agree here, sizing is a bit tricky. I actually got one of each size, then locally resold the one that didn't fit (rather than dealing with shipping back to China for the return)."
chicagobulls,3e1lye,flatfootsamm,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"So obviously they aren't legitimate/authentic jerseys, but for $20 I think they are well worth it. The shipping is dependent on the seller and how fast it gets through their sorting facilities in China. I've had some packages stay there for a week and a half and I've had some that are there for a day.   Usually though it takes like two weeks for it to get to my door from the moment I order it. Each page has their estimated shipping times from like 12-27 days so really it could be pretty much anywhere between there. If it makes you feel better I've never had something take a month to get to me.  Here is a link to a page. Hope this helps."
chicagobulls,3e1lye,Waffle_Frisbee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"I just got a Pippen '92 Dream Team jersey a month or so ago from Aliexpress (and a #23 TuneSquad). I think it was  $14 bucks for the dream team with free shipping. Obviously it isn't legit, but it still seems pretty quality. They're all stitch on (not iron on), so they look real nice too.  Flip them inside out when washing, and let them air-dry. I have not had any issue with either.  One jersey took about 6 days to ship, the other took about 2 weeks. So it seems that varies. But like I said, free shipping."
chicagobulls,3e1lye,flatfootsamm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:06 2015 UTC,So far everyone who has commented is pretty spot on about price and shipping. One thing I would watch out for is that there are multiple sellers with the pinstripe jersey with prices ranging from about $11-$25. Just toss the extra 10 and get a more expensive one because it is less likely to look like a cheap knock off

For one thing, the Bulls would play the better the defense of the two as long as you give them a true center.

chicagobulls,3dybol,augiemarched,3,Mon Jul 20 20:05:25 2015 UTC,And Magic would piss off Kobe with his subpar defense.
chicagobulls,3dybol,calliope_jack,39,Tue Jul 21 07:43:22 2015 UTC,"hmmm...Lakers would probably win.  I mean that team doesn't even include Wilt or Jerry West.  The Bulls team would not have Horace Grant though, Artis Gilmore would be the starting center."
chicagobulls,3dybol,kyrish,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:12:51 2015 UTC,Horace or Rodman?
chicagobulls,3dybol,BlackMathNerd,22,Mon Jul 20 16:12:39 2015 UTC,I pick Rodman.
chicagobulls,3dybol,capncrunch94,0,Mon Jul 20 16:25:11 2015 UTC,It's sad that we have to include a guy who only played for the team for 3 years. A lot of Lakers greats had at least 7 years with the team.
chicagobulls,3dybol,keyboredcats,8,Mon Jul 20 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"Lol it isn't sad, Bulls are still one of the great franchises of all time.  That's like saying it's sad that my daddy is only a neurosurgeon when my friend's daddy is a CEO"
chicagobulls,3dybol,asovermann,14,Mon Jul 20 20:02:03 2015 UTC,"It comes down to the big men, Rose/Magic, Jordan/Kobe, and Pippen/Baylor would all be interesting matchups. Rodman and Grant would definitely have their hands full with Shaq/Kareem. I think the Lakers probably win with Wilt and West both off of the bench."
chicagobulls,3dybol,trapper2530,5,Mon Jul 20 15:38:21 2015 UTC,Don't forget Worthy.
chicagobulls,3dybol,Rotten_tacos,3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:01 2015 UTC,Can we count Gasol or prime Noah?  That's a little better
chicagobulls,3dybol,asovermann,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"I always go by the rule of whichever team they played for the longest, in that case Pau could also easily be on the Lakers bench having played 6 1/2 in Memphis and 6 1/2 in LA. Noah counts though. In that case though the Lakers would probably have to sub out Wilt for prime Andrew Bynum when he was the 2nd best center in the league arguably."
chicagobulls,3dybol,Coheedn20,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"No one is going to replace Wilt with Bynum. I'm not someone that thinks wilt didn't benefit from the time period he played, but the man was an athletic freak and would have no problem against today's players."
chicagobulls,3dybol,asovermann,4,Mon Jul 20 17:28:53 2015 UTC,I'm only saying that because Wilt played a majority of his career on a Philly Organization. Hard to consider him a Laker when everyone knows him from his time in Philly.

chicagobulls,3dybol,ArthurDentsTea,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:03 2015 UTC,Imo wilt is starting
chicagobulls,3dybol,itsfineitsgreat,11,Mon Jul 20 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"He's right. The Bulls have had like three ""great"" eras. Obviously the Jordan one, with like three of the best teams of all time.   Then they have two eras that reached the conference finals, I think once each (Norm Van Lier/Jerry Sloan, and our current era).  The Lakers have had like 10 eras as good as the Bulls' second best.  So yeah, their all time team is gonna be better."
chicagobulls,3dybol,demafrost,4,Mon Jul 20 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Lakers would win, but I'm not sure Shaq cracks the Lakers starting 5, so the joke's on him.  I'd personally go with a starting lineup of Magic - West- Kobe (at SF) - Wilt (at PF) - Kareem  A bit of playing out of position, but There's way too much talent there.  Bench would consist of Goodrich, Baylor, Worthy, Pau, Mikan, and Shaq  Bulls go with Rose, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, Gilmore with Van Lier, Sloan, Deng, Love, and Grant on the bench (Jimmy too).  As great as Rodman is defensively, the Bulls bigs would be absolutely eaten alive by Wilt and Kareem (not to mention Shaq and Mikan), even if Pippen neutralizes Kobe or West, and MJ neutralizes Magic, they just can't match up to 2 of the greatest bigs of all time, especially playing an undersized guy (albeit a great defensive one) at PF and I don't think Gilmore was all that great defensively (correct me if I'm wrong)"
chicagobulls,3dybol,Peteroxhands,3,Mon Jul 20 17:10:14 2015 UTC,Tony K. Makes the team before deng in my opinion. DPOY Noah is in there too.
chicagobulls,3dybol,I_only_post_here,5,Mon Jul 20 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"Is this really that much of an argument?  I mean, as much as I love the Bulls, it's pretty obvious the Lakers have been the more successful franchise overall with more than twice as many championships.  They've had multiple great ""eras"" and as such have had more all-time great players play for them.  It looks to me like the Bull's top-5 comes fairly close to the Laker's top-5 players, but I would argue the Lakers come out better.  And then their depth would put the Bulls to shame.  Though it would be a closer game than 50.  But if the Bulls go Gilmore and Noah in the middle it would be a lot better than Horace."
chicagobulls,3dybol,MonsieurMaestro,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think it's that much of an argument at all. I think the Lakers could win handily, albeit not by 50.  Still, an entertaining match up."
chicagobulls,3dybol,MaceWindusLightsaber,3,Mon Jul 20 17:33:32 2015 UTC,What would our starting five be?
chicagobulls,3dybol,BlackMathNerd,3,Mon Jul 20 16:08:24 2015 UTC,I'd go with Rose/Jordan/Pippen/Rodman/Gilmore

chicagobulls,3dybol,jwjmaster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"Uh, yeah. This isn't even an argument, the Lakers have 5 top 20 ALL-TIME players, and that's not including Baylor, Pau, Worthy, West, etc. plus a huge host of high quality role players to pick from. Maybe if we got lucky we could beat them or hang with them in one game, but over a series, we'd be slaughtered."
chicagobulls,3dybol,illini81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think most of the Lakers could play well together other than Magic, Kareem, Wilt, and maybe one of Worthy/West. Which would match up pretty well against Mj, Pippen, Kukoc, Rodman/Gilmore, Rose.   I can only imagine a game with your options offensively MJ, Rose, Pippen, Kukoc, Rodman/Gilmore as your 1-5 options. There would be perfect ball movement and chemistry. They could realistically all play a 45 minutes as well.  If you put Sloan and Storm'in Norm on the team Lakers would be too bloodied to win. Haven't seen much of Love or Gilmore not sure where they would fit."

chicagobulls,3dybol,TianDogg,2,Mon Jul 20 18:42:30 2015 UTC,The only reason i think Lakers would win is because the size they would have over us. Jordan would keep it close but we have nothing to stop their big men.
chicagobulls,3dybol,object_on_my_desk,0,Mon Jul 20 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"The all-time Bulls don't really have an answer to the waves of dominant big men the Lakers could send at them. I was thinking maybe the Bulls could make up for that with three point shooting, but none of MJ, Pippen, or Rose are really long range shooters. And if it comes down to perimeter play, prime Kobe is still a pretty damn good defender and Magic has a huge amount of size on Rose.  So yeah I think the Lakers would win... just too many tough matchups."
chicagobulls,3dybol,regular_feller,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"Do we get everybody in their prime or when they played for each respective team?  Carlos Boozer in his prime with the Jazz might be better than Rodman (depending on how you want to build a team).   Also, one game or best of 7?  Jordan never lost in a best of 7 in his prime.  I see no reason to think otherwise with a stacked lineup."

chicagobulls,3dybol,iPissVelvet,0,Mon Jul 20 21:44:16 2015 UTC,"But if it was a full 12 min quarter for 4 quarters, does that include bench players. Lakers would win no doubt. But still believe in MJ. If they included bench players of all time greats, Lakers would demolish the bulls all-time great. The offseason struggle is real."
chicagobulls,3dybol,blackersabbath,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"No way winning by 50 points when you've got the GOAT, but that Lakers lineup... nobody's beating them. Our All-Time team would probably get the closest, followed by the Celtics."
chicagobulls,3dybol,Guidonculous,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:22 2015 UTC,Pip would lock down magic.MJ would lock down Bryant. Comes down to bigs doing their job.
chicagobulls,3dybol,Malibooch,0,Mon Jul 20 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"The lakers just have so many great players, there's absolutely no way to create a team. The lakers best functional lineup would probably be something like magic, west, Baylor, jabber and wilt. You can certainly make arguments that other lakers were better, but it's difficult to field a lineup that can coexist with that many superstars. Kobe and shaq have no business playing next to those in my fictional starting lineup.   The Bulls are in a unique spot that their stars would coexist so well. A Rose, Jordan, Pippen, Grant And Gilmore lineup sounds extremely functional and outlandishly athletically skilled."
chicagobulls,3dybol,poorchris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:07 2015 UTC,I think he meant just 5 on 5 based on the picture. Derrick Rose would run circles around Magic

The Bulls had the greatest team in NBA history, then they had the second greatest team in NBA history.  Pick the best individual Lakers team from any era and neither would beat Chicago's best.  The real best of the best is what matters."
chicagobulls,3dybol,raj96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"They would NOT win by 50. Not even with the Bulls gaping big man disadvantage.  Would they win? Sure. But it would be close.  I am the conductor of the ""Jordan is the all time greatest and nobody is close not even close not even you LeBron"" train, but LeBron in his prime with an inferior team couldn't beat the Warriors. Jordan would keep it close, but when Shaq can't crack the starting rotation, that's a tough team to beat, especially when your best big men are Artis Gilmore and...I don't know...Joakim Noah or Tom Boerwinkle?  I bet with the anti-handcheck rules it would be closer!"
chicagobulls,3dybol,object_on_my_desk,0,Mon Jul 20 17:45:12 2015 UTC,Magic  Kobe  Baylor   Kareem  Wilt/Shaq  Vs  Rose   Jordan  Pippen   Grant/Rodman  Pau probably  Yeah I think the Lakers would win
chicagobulls,3dybol,raj96,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:11 2015 UTC,Pau could just as easily come off the bench for the Lakers. Just a thought.

His 3 game is fine, Hoiberg has praised the number of threes he has hit in practice, even saying he hit 30 in a row at one point. Let's let him play with his actual teammates, in the actual offense, before we judge whether or not he can do anything. If everything else needs to be taken with a grain of salt, his 2-16 performance from deep should too."

chicagobulls,3dzoz0,holidayshoplifter,5,Mon Jul 20 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, we shouldn't read too much into his SL performance because they don't mean much.  But, the rest of what you have to see is where we disagree.  I won't talk about the 3pt shooting since others have addressed it.  Working on his post up game is good despite it being against SLeaguers.  With many teams playing small ball and Hoibergs offense that is made to create mismatches, his post up game can be used at an NBA level.  Also, if he cam get the Dirk fade away, height of his defender may not be detrimental so long as he can create the space with a fade to get a shot off.  I liked that we saw more of an attacking Dougie because it expands on his offensive abilities.  You may be skeptical if he can carry that into the season, but I'm not.  He may never beat someone in an ISO but there are other ways he can take advantage using his driving ability.  We saw it at times throughout last season.  So yes, we shouldn't act like his SL performance automatically translates to the regular season, but shouldn't dismiss what he's worked on during this time and how it can help improve him next season."
chicagobulls,3dzoz0,gwats,6,Mon Jul 20 21:31:27 2015 UTC,"Doug was drafted to score, not shoot 3's.  People who think he's a spot-up shooter didn't see him at Creighton.

chicagobulls,3dzoz0,Doug_McDermott,4,Tue Jul 21 00:19:30 2015 UTC,He wasn't drafted to only shoot 3s. There is a lot more to Doug's game than the 3-ball. He's more Wally Szczerbiak than Kyle Korver.

chicagobulls,3dzoz0,Kknowledge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"I agree..... There is a lot of hype surrounding D-McB and, frankly, I just don't get why.  Sure he was an amazing College player and an amazing Summer League player but so what?  He got some mins early in the season and was completely ineffective.  That's why Thibs sat him.  There have been far better College players who turn out to be busts so don't be surprised if thats what we got.  I truly hope McDermott turns into a legit offensive threat but I have no reason to believe that's gonna happen.  I'd much rather spend my time developing Nico and Snelly-Cat."
chicagobulls,3dzoz0,woogwhy,0,Tue Jul 21 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yep.  You're totally right.  He got a few minutes at the beginning of his rookie year, while he wasn't 100% healthy, and he wasn't incredible.  So Thibs sat him.  So he must be a bust."
chicagobulls,3dzoz0,rowseyna,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:33 2015 UTC,Guess we'll find out for certain next year.
chicagobulls,3dzoz0,woogwhy,0,Tue Jul 21 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Why do you say that Doug was drafted to shoot threes?  How can you possibly say that?  I mean, obviously SL should be taken with a grain of salt, but that's just because it's SL.  I really don't think you can speak to what Doug's ""primary purpose"" as a Bull is.  It's also pretty hard to say that anything about that draft pick has ""failed"" after only one season (the type of season it was, especially).  With all the evidence provided to you over Doug's life as a shooter, you honestly think there's a better chance that he won't be a good 3P shooter than he will be?  I'll take that bet.  And why can't he use his overall offensive game in the NBA?  Why is there ""no chance""?  That seems awfully premature of you."
chicagobulls,3dzoz0,rowseyna,0,Tue Jul 21 13:49:08 2015 UTC,He will figure out the threes. I don't care about SL performances because 75% of those rosters will be in the d league or Europe next year

chicagobulls,3dz74o,Lethalstramboli,8,Mon Jul 20 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, it kind of makes sense, but not really.  The Jazz traded away kanter in part to make space for gobert up front and a sweet first round pick for next year.  I kind of doubt they would trade away young key pieces for a backup win now frontcourt guy.  And the whole 'Taj bring a culture of winning' thing is such BS.  There are tons of guys around the league both players and staff that you could make that argument for, it doesn't affect their trade value that much.  That being said, it's a steal for the bulls, and instantly fixes all of our backcourt and wing depth issues, but I doubt it happens.  It really doesn't make sense for utah, trade 2 22 year old up and comers from your already weak backcourt for a 30 year old backup power forward when you're about 2-3 years from competing?"

chicagobulls,3dz74o,BigDude23,0,Mon Jul 20 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"Sure, he could, but not likely for that deal.  I can't see the Jazz doing that.  It's too lopsided in the Bulls favor.  Maybe they'd consider Taj for Burke, but no way they're giving up both of those young guys with potential for 30-year-old, injured Taj Gibson.  They just drafted Lyles.  However, I'd definitely do Taj for Burke straight up if they'd have it (they wouldn't) and obviously would also do the proposed trade, but there's about a 0.0% chance."

chicagobulls,3dyikd,asovermann,0,Mon Jul 20 17:08:43 2015 UTC,I know that but why trade for him after you just paid Pat that much money ? Any word on what Lawson deal is like?
chicagobulls,3dyikd,asovermann,5,Mon Jul 20 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"Beverley is only making 6.5 mil, and it's a front loaded deal meaning he's going to make less each of the next three seasons. That's a pretty dang good contract for one of the best back-up PG's in the league. Especially with the new cap. Lawson is only making 12.4 this year."
chicagobulls,3dyikd,kinnaston,6,Mon Jul 20 17:19:37 2015 UTC,Well they signed Beverley before Lawson became so cheap on the market following his latest alcohol related incident so that might explain it. They weren't going to not sign Beverley.
chicagobulls,3dyikd,asovermann,4,Mon Jul 20 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"What a windfall for Houston.

chicagobulls,3dup1a,wjbc,10,Sun Jul 19 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"Your ""Why"" piece ends with a sentence that makes more sense as a closer for your ""Won't"" section. With that said, you did a great job illustrating that there's more questions than answers for the Bulls this year (just like the last 3) and that everything has to go right for them to be a serious contender. Your pessimism is just, anyone who thinks you're off base is just bummed out with the reality of the roster as it stands now."
chicagobulls,3dup1a,DonnyRad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I may have just taken the premise of the series too literally.  I got into trouble when they turned to the Kings and I confessed I didn't see any plausible scenario for them to win a championship.  At least for the Bulls, the possibility exists.  I mean, it really is possible, we know it is, if everything comes together this season -- it's just highly improbable.  That's better than a lot of teams can say!"
chicagobulls,3dup1a,iPissVelvet,6,Sun Jul 19 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty accurate if you ask me. Given health and consistency, this team is a contender. But there are too many variables. And then, Lebron and the West all have stacked teams. I mean, this is about as accurate as it gets."

chicagobulls,3dup1a,fuckingastronaut,5,Sun Jul 19 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"Optimistic- Bulls can't get any worse, with thibs the only time we outperformed was that Brooklyn series... and we underperformed against Washington...  We have the same roster (last year this time we were wildly seen as contenders and that only brought pressure/hype) only this year Drose and Noah get a healthy offseason, Jimmy is 25, Niko 24 and in his second year in the league, and Hoiberg is ready made for this era's NBA...  The same question remains, can we get past lbj? If so we're going to the finals, if not then it's the same old story...  I really don't understand the pessimism... we have a high floor and are contenders (I see GSW, SA & OKC in the west and CLE & CHI in the east, I don't believe in LAC/HOU/MEM but they're in the west anyway, and MIA/WAS/ATL/MIL are solid teams but I don't see them winning 3 consecutive series)  I'm pumped for this year. The coaching change is HUGE and I hope we see our guys having fun out there, that change in attitude and subsequent play style is exactly what we needed and loosing this past year should take some pressure (I alluded to this earlier) off our guys. I believe in DRose and Jimmy, I like our depth and mix of veterans and personalities, and I believe Niko and Tony will shine in their second and third years and in Hoiberg's system"
chicagobulls,3dup1a,Riderz_of_Brohan,0,Sun Jul 19 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"With Thibodeau the Bulls consistently overperformed during the regular season, at least until last season, setting up high expectations for the playoffs, which weren't met.  Will Hoiberg sacrifice regular season success, hoping it will pay off with better health in the playoffs?  Let's keep track of Butler's minutes and see what happens.  Last year's optimism was based in no small part on Joakim Noah coming off the best year of his career.  Last year he fell off a cliff and we have no assurances that it's a temporary condition.  I'm only pessimistic about winning a championship, I'm optimistic about them getting to the ECF.  But getting past the Cavs and whoever wins the West seems like a tall order.  Possible, yes, but not at all probable.  But there are very few teams for whom it is more plausible -- only the Cavs in the East, a few teams in the West."

chicagobulls,3dup1a,woogwhy,2,Sun Jul 19 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"as one of the 4 best teams in the eastern conference, we have at least a puncher's chance at the trophy  Our young players seem to improve at a growing rate each year - If Jimmy's offseason goal this year is developing his 3 point shot he could become an even deadlier weapon.  Joakim has a chance to get himself into shape, Mirotic and McD have another year of seasoning and body-building, Snell has shown quality in all aspects of the game at times and could make a real leap in consistency this season, and maybe most importantly this is the first season where Rose played enough and stayed healthy enough that we could reasonably expect to see him make skill progression as a player for the first time in years.  Whatever you think about him never being the same athlete, he can still get to the rim and has still shown an elite floater game from mid-range.  If he has more space and more creative opportunity with Hoiberg's offense we could see a real renaissance of Rose.  Obviously these things aren't guaranteed or even likely, but they are possible.  Hoiberg will completely revolutionize our offense and hopefully take the 3 ball away from Derrick unless he shows real improvement - we were the number 10 offense last year and can expect improvement due to scheme change and health.    If the Bulls can stay healthy and succeed in a new system they're capable of making the conference finals and even winning the East, if either or both of those things go wrong, or the defense collapses completely because Noah and Taj aren't the same, the Bulls could sink pretty hard.  Milwaukee, Indiana, Atlanta, and Toronto will all be reasonably formidable competition.  There is reason to believe that Pau's game outside midrange shooting disappears in the playoffs and a mid-season trade to gird our loins from the playoffs could involve us moving a big piece of our frontcourt for something like a quality backup point guard and a pick."
chicagobulls,3dup1a,dandangles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:46:26 2015 UTC,"That's a very fair assessment.  As a fan it's hard to accept the reality of a situation.  The Bulls have a great team, and probably will be better than last year but a title is gonna be tough.  Not out of the question....but tough."
chicagobulls,3dup1a,MundaneInternetGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"I believe that Rose and Butler haven't played with each other enough to have that chemistry down pat.  Add in a new coach with hopefully better offensive looks, it could be great.  I'm very excited about Hoiberg and how our offense is going to look.  Summer league showed us a glimpse into the quick sets we will run and they look fantastic. We've been given a quoted 5%? look at the offensive sets run by Hoiberg.. I'm optimistic.  Imagine the our roster running these instead of D-Leaguers and I'm at full mast.  I'm emphasizing our coaching change because it was reported earlier during the playoffs that the our offense was so predictable that the opposition could figure out what set we were going to run, with Hoiberg and all these drag screens and early shot clock attempts (good looks though), I'm hoping this is what we need.   Not saying the situation is the same here, but Wade and LeBron didn't exactly hit it off in Miami the first year.  They had flashes of brilliance, as did Rose and Butler this past year.  Give them more time to work out the kinks.    Add in the growth of our young core (Niko, Snell, McD) and the addition of a great young big in Portis.. things look pretty good in my opinion.      Also, as said by others before.. 1st post season in a while that Rose has had time to actually work out rather than focus on rehab, who knows.. playing with Westbrook might spark a fire in him.    Steph Curry was labeled injury prone, and he's now a champion.  Things change quickly, and maybe this coaching change was what we needed.  Only time will tell.   Long post, but I hope this persuades you to not look at our situation so.. grimly.  Cheer up, go Bulls!"

chicagobulls,3dsykg,guigoreis,7,Sun Jul 19 04:46:00 2015 UTC,Nice to see Portis have a good game. Love his aggressiveness
chicagobulls,3dsykg,SaucyMustard,6,Sun Jul 19 04:29:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of those screen and rolls seemed like easy buckets against defenders getting lost. Good to know he can run basic plays and finish at the rim. His jab-step pull-up and that little hook off the glass were real smooth. I think this kid can develop into a great teammate. He's got to get to fucking work though. Have him hang out with Jimmy and Taj. We need him in the gym working on his game non-stop. No internet for you this summer Bobby P. Bulls have done well with strong character guys. If his intense stares are anything to go off of, he's got the mental toughness aspect of the game. Looks like he really wants to compete. Looks hungry.   edit: anyone getting a Garnett vibe off this guy?"
chicagobulls,3dsykg,bitemydickallthetime,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"he looks like garnett, he acts like garnett and he plays like garnett"
chicagobulls,3dsykg,idontcarefuckit,3,Sun Jul 19 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"The only player who's been remotely like Garnett, since Garnett, is Anthony Davis."
chicagobulls,3dsykg,poorchris,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Not true. He might be only one who is close to him ability-wise, but there are plenty of players with a similar playstyle."
chicagobulls,3dsykg,idontcarefuckit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but if so none of them are Bobby Portis.  KG was one of the most versatile bigs the game has ever seen.  A 7 footer who could go off the dribble, move his feet laterally on D with the best of opponents, drill the mid range shot with superb efficiency while still protecting the rim and playing out of the post.    Portis right now is a hustle player who's defense and pacing needs a lot of work.  He's also nowhere near the athletic specimen that KG was.  Portis' offensive style is more jack-of-all trades but master-of-none, while Garnett was virtually a master of many styles.  It's yet to be determined if many of Bobby's skills will even transfer to the NBA level.    I guess if the qualification for ""playing like KG and acting like KG"" is just playing fast and hard then you can call a ton of players similar to him but that's not how I'd compare them at all."
chicagobulls,3dsykg,poorchris,0,Mon Jul 20 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"Anthony Davis is so much more than even kevin Garnett ever was. Also, the styles of their games are pretty different, I remember even a young KG being a pretty fundamental defender, whereas Davis is unique in how bad some of his fundamentals are defensively and how little it matters because he is just a Demi-God among men.   Actually, in terms of style and attitude, portis reminds me much more of Garnett than Davis does."
chicagobulls,3dsykg,Guidonculous,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"Anthony Davis is so much more than even kevin Garnett ever was.   What?    Maybe post-2010 Garnett...  KG at his peak, is arguably the single greatest PF of all time on both ends of the floor.  I adore Anthony Davis but he's a poor man's KG even after the spectacular season he just had.     Actually in terms of style and attitude, portis reminds me much more of Garnett than Davis does.    Everybody gets that Portis is farther on the hot head scale than Anthony Davis, but that doesn't mean he's most comparable to Garnett.    AD and KG are/were both athletic anomalies, defensive freaks, virtuosos of versatility and deadeye mid range shooters.  Bobby has a good jumper for a big guy, and he's known as a hustle player.  That's the end of the KG comparisons to me."
chicagobulls,3dsykg,poorchris,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"KG is awesome, and certainly a different class player than Portis. I don't see how he's better than Duncan or Malone, so it's hard to say he was ever the best player at his position during his career. I'm obviously projecting here since AD has only played two seasons, but I think he's set to shatter most of KDs numbers.   I also think you are vastly underestimating portis' game if you think all he can do is hustle. Watch for his 22nd pick to go down in infamy as a tremendously dumb move by a lot of GMs. Please don't misread this as me saying portis is closer to KG in talent than KG is to AD, that would be insane."

I feel like hes just been through a lot , and this is a newer him being better and smarter.. i hope hes out there teaching PJ all the rights and wrongs of life, and balling tf out in a gym somewhere getting that perfect handle back and getting that quicker first step.

If we want more of a combo guard, we should go with vander blue (who's 6'4"") and maybe work him in rotation (at some point, if snellycat doesn't work out) and play him with derrick… maybe a very poor man's d-wade"

chicagobulls,3dns6g,ssor21,13,Fri Jul 17 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"You can pretty much ignore people saying he's not quick enough to be a good on-ball defender; they're simply telling you their racial biases.  From his pre-draft combine:   Doug McDermott 36.5” max vert, 11.10 lane agility, 3.29 sprint  One has to give “Dougie McBuckets” props for putting up a max vert that was well above what people expected. Not only did he show solid athleticism for a 3, tying with TJ Warren for the fastest lane agility among the SF group. McDermott was a player whose expectations versus reality put him in the “winners” bracket. Amazingly, his 36.5 max vert was just .5 inch lower than ""freak athlete"" KJ McDanels. His scores in the testing show that he is at least not a slouch athletically and should help promote the idea of his being a solid rotation player with a ready made role.    McDermott clearly has enough lateral agility and power generation to play defense.  McDermott's problems are unlikely to be related to athleticism."

""Outmatched"" athletes (what ever the fuck that means) don't have to be careful about hitting their heads on the backboard when they dunk.  It's crazy how it's so hard for you to admit a white guy can be 1) a good athlete and 2) not know how to play under control and in position."
chicagobulls,3dns6g,ACAB112233,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of a jump saying that I can't admit he's athletic bc he's white. I'm never one to group white guys together like that. I was very vocal about super Mario and prozingus being highly athletic.  I think it's crazy that you can watch McDermott and say that he is an average athlete for an NBA small forward. There's a lot of things to like about him but he just looks slow, not just controlled but slow."
chicagobulls,3dns6g,YourCummyBear,3,Sat Jul 18 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"He hasn't looked slow in summer league.  Saying he's slow, despite combine numbers to the contrary, because of his play with a torn meniscus last year is just silly."

chicagobulls,3dns6g,sbaker93,8,Sat Jul 18 06:24:39 2015 UTC,"You can watch a game and think to yourself ""I don't think he's moving his feet fast enough to keep up with guards"" without being racist.  Plus, combine stats are completely pointless after the draft. They only serve as a way to filter down your shortlist, nothing more. Just because he can be ""athletic"" in a laboratory doesn't mean he can predict the movements of an NBA guard and react fast enough. They're completely different things.  And, I'll reiterate my point, disagreeing with a combine stat does not automatically mean your opinions are formed purely based on race. Saying that is absurd."

chicagobulls,3dns6g,ACAB112233,5,Sat Jul 18 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"His on-ball is not good but it's not as awful as people tend to believe. If we're doing the old baseball rating metric of [(--), (-), (average), (+), (++)], I think Doug is a (-) on-ball and a (--) on help.   His issue with ""help"" defense is he gets super hyper for some reason. He overcommits and leaves his man far too often and doesn't have the quickness to re-engage. Guys like Jimmy Butler and Tony Allen can get away with over-helping but Doug doesn't have that luxury. The bright side is I think he can get better. He'll have to calm down, learn the intricacies of help D (didn't play D at all in college) and he should get a better idea of what he can and can't do.  His on-ball D is solid on the perimeter. He fights through screens and does a decent job pushing guys to the baseline. He gets bludgeoned in the paint though. When guys get deep enough post-position, he's like a fish out of water. Perhaps his increased strength helps."
chicagobulls,3dns6g,thehungarianjordan,2,Fri Jul 17 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"wow that is an extremely accurate assessment of his defense. I'm impressed that you're watching that closely.   The team gave up 6.4 more points per 100 possessions when Doug was on the court last year. That is very, very poor."
chicagobulls,3dns6g,iChoke,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:13:04 2015 UTC,Nah. Pay close attention to him when you watch Summer Leagues. He fails to have court vision on the defensive end to rotate when there is help.
chicagobulls,3dns6g,njasa10,20,Fri Jul 17 21:22:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, I feel comfortable saying I've probably watched Doug as much as anyone out there.  In person and on TV.  I live in Omaha and for 3+ years this guy was must see TV at Creighton.  The whole town was buzzing his senior year.  There are pieces of Doug's game that are easily NBA caliber, even elite caliber.  But there are weaknesses that hold him back big time at the top level, where you need to be great at all parts of your game.  The biggest problem is obviously his defense and his overall speed.  The upside to his game are his touch around the rim, his post moves, his mid range shot, his fade away, his basketball IQ, and until recently, his long range shooting.  Ok, what I'm about to say is going to lose a lot of you guys, but stick with me.  Doug's touch around the rim is ELITE.  I mean like almost Lebron good.  Well not Lebron good (he's the GOAT around the rim IMHO) but definitely All Star caliber.  If Doug is within 5 feet of the basket he is so money with his left or right hand, his moves are strong, and he can be getting clobbered and the ball still finds a way in.  I wish other people could see this is his game and not just assume he's a 3 point shooter only because he's white and nobody watched him in college.  Doug is also best as a volume shooter.  If he's the go to guy on the team, he gets in a rhythm and lights it up.  That's why having him on the floor the same time as DRose and Jimmy Butler and having Doug sit in the corner and wait is not going to go well for him.  Which is unfortunate.  Remember Linsanity?  All because Melo and JR Smith were both out.  Doug could do what Jeremy Lin did I swear to god.  He just needs to shoot at volume and get going.  It's because of this I'm not sure he'll ever have that much success with the Bulls, which saddens me to say.  Hoiberg may give him that shot though if DRose goes down again and Jimmy Butler is taking a breather.  Thibs would never have given him that shot.    If Doug were to go to Europe and play in a league over there, he would be an All Star easily and possibly an MVP.  It's just a game that's played more at his pace, just like the Summer League is at his pace. Maybe that's what he needs.  Go be the MVP over there, master that Dirk fadeaway he's been working on, then come back over here for a team like Orlando or Utah or Denver or Charlotte and be THE guy off the bench.  Like when the starters are resting, he gets 70% of the touches (think Jamal Crawford, Aaron Brooks, or Nate Robinson).  That is the way that Doug can be great in the NBA.  I'm hoping Hoiberg gives him a lot of touches when the starters are sitting and let's him get into his groove.  We'll see.  If he has another year like last year, I think it'll be best for Doug to move on and find his fit somewhere else.    EDIT: Jeremy Lin, haha, see how quickly we forget that guy"

chicagobulls,3dns6g,ibreatheintoem,4,Sun Jul 19 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"I have hope for Dougie yet, I think he'll be a NBA caliber player but I wonder if it will be with the squad we have now.   I get worried seeing him succeed in the summer league because a lot of his highlights are driving to the basket and 2nd chance/effort plays. The guy looks like a layup god in SL and I'm not sure that will translate when playing against organized NBA defenses with proper help rotations, less overplaying the ball, and simply put a higher standard of athlete (speed, length, bball IQ).   I don't think he actually looks as slow as people say he is, his foot speed and footwork actually looks solid enough (if maybe a little rushed), but nevertheless the highlights I want to see are of Doug are him draining spot up threes, pull up jumpers, and step backs. Seeing him drive to the lane through an imaginary Taj/Pau and kicking it out to 30% from three imaginary D. Rose is backwards from the expectations I have (which doesn't really matter), and I think backwards from the expectations of the team (which does, but maybe I'm totally wrong and they want him to drive).   It seems like the stretch goal for him as a player is a better Dunleavy. The problem with that is that Dun Dun is a 3 AND D guy who in addition to consistently stretching the floor (almost 41% from three in the regular season, over 48% from three in the playoffs), also provides generally underrated defense. A lot of casual fans see him as this awkward scrappy shooter gym-rat old guy and wonder why he's out there instead of Doug or Snell. Then there's the fans on this sub who actually watch the regular season that know that he's the second best perimeter defender on the whole team behind Butler, remember him having great performances defending Lebron in recent postseasons and the regular season when Butler has been out, and know that some presumably flawed but nevertheless trend-illuminating advanced stat in the most recent Sloan conference put him among the best perimeter defenders in the league (spoilers: he was ranked #1). What people are worried about is that Dougie in comparison looks a bit raw despite being a 4-year college player now going into his second year in the league. His 3 seems inconsistent and his struggles on D might make him a minus player even if his 3 is falling at an above average rate.  Doug was a rookie last year, and anyone who saw him struggle last year and considers him a failed draft pick is daft. He'll be a sophmore this year, and anyone who see's him struggle this year and still writes him off is still jumping the gun. He seems pretty skilled at finishing around the basket, posting up, driving to the hoop, and has only shown flashes of hot shooting from range. The problem for the Bulls is that in theory we probably want Butler and Rose mostly driving and initiating plays, Taj and Pau posting and facing up, Dunleavy, Snell, Mirotic, and Doug working the perimeter, all while Noah cleans the boards and facilitates with his passing. If Doug's best apparent skills (driving and finishing) are something we want someone else doing, and what we want him doing (3&D) others on the team are doing better, things feel awkward."

Hell, he was abused on defense by summer league players.   If he could grow into a Wally type player, I'd be psyched. Go look at Wally Szczerbiak's basketball reference page, at his per 36 numbers. You might be underrating him in retrospect. I think that's his ceiling, and if he hits it, I'd consider that trade/pick a hit. That's not a bad ceiling for a 12th pick in a not great draft."

It's also way too early to judge the trade.  And I don't know about ""universally"" anything.  I haven't seen many strong opinions formed on that trade one way or the other, yet.  And how could there be?  We're only a year from it.  And really, maybe don't bring SL into it.  You want to bring up his poor defense when he was on the SL First-Team for two years in a row?

And he's got great hustle and good size for a SF.  My only concern, and it's not really a negative, is that what we see in SL won't be how he plays in the NBA. He's playing at PF and scoring on offensive putbacks, posting up, contested fadeaways and other shots that he won't get on the NBA level.   And that's fine, nobody expects Doug to score 20+ ppg as his role on the Bulls."
chicagobulls,3dns6g,hortle,2,Sat Jul 18 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"Its funny reading through some of the Doug threads on here how much people are surprised by his skills outside of shooting. The only thing the dude isn't good at is defense and dribbling. He's arguably average to below average at both. Motor, creating space to shoot, physicality, rebounding (relative to his physical tools), finding open space on cuts, touch around the rim (and his ability to get the ball up quickly around the rim), finding the open guy, these are all things he excelled at in his four years at Creighton. If you play him at the 3 he will definitely be a mismatch on offense in Hoiberg's system, and with time I don't see how he can't hold his own on defense against the Wilson Chandlers or Demarre Carrolls of the world. And he's the perfect option against a team going small like GSW did in the finals. I watched almost every game he played when he was at Creighton, there is no way he doesn't regain that long range shooting touch after so many examples of consistency.  Doug was counted out in high school, didn't start until his senior year. The coaches thought he'd have to redshirt at CU until he put up 14 and 7 against Iowa State in a closed scrimmage. People pegged him at best a borderline first rounder until he came back and stuffed the ball down every team's throat in the new big east. He has always proved naysayers wrong. I bet on him becoming a valuable starter in the league eventually"

The kid can score from anywhere on the floor, completely off balance, driving, catch-and-shoot, or with a post move. He's got some serious talent and has obviously put a ton of work into his game all over the floor. Anyone who says he can't create his own shot must just be talking about the version of him in 2k15."

TWELVE... yet people expect him to suddenly be a knockdown 3pt shooter. Sure he hit 47% of 3s post surgery, but out of 12 made total, he wasn't hitting many of them. He shot 32% from 3 last season, and is shooting less than 10% on 3s in summer league right now, and you think he's just gonna start hitting them? I don't think it's realistic to expect him to knock down those shots until he does knock down those shots.  I'm a huge fan of Doug, but i'm so tired of people thinking he's still in college. He's been a below-average NBA player, and a horrible 3pt shooter. He's fantastic offensively, overall, but not from long range. He's much better around the rim and from midrange where he shot nearly 46%. Even in summer league, we've seen how good he's finishing around the rim, albeit against lesser talent."

chicagobulls,3do1yu,jwjmaster,3,Sun Jul 19 01:10:19 2015 UTC,Any reason why LA would choose Thibs over Brooks?  Edit: words
chicagobulls,3do1yu,plausiblepeanuts,4,Sat Jul 18 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"Because Thibs is a way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way (deep breath), way, way, way, way better coach than Brooks."
chicagobulls,3do1yu,HinduMexican,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this seems to be the consensus most people I've talked to have come towards as well. Makes the most sense for both sides"
chicagobulls,3do1yu,Kumdogmillionaire,12,Sat Jul 18 06:44:48 2015 UTC,"He's still an assistant on Team USA.  He'll probably do more TV work as he did briefly during the playoffs.  But absent another firing somewhere in the league, he'll be sitting out the season, collecting his money, and then interviewing for jobs at the end of the season."

chicagobulls,3do1yu,djbuttplay,7,Sun Jul 19 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"We're still paying him a portion (all?) of his salary for this year. Indications before the firing were that he'd sit out for the year if fired, and it seems to be the case. Been reported that he is interested in the Lakers job, should it become available.  Edit- I don't think there's any way he takes another assistant job. Every team in the league knows he's got the potential to turn a team into a playoff team."
chicagobulls,3do1yu,alexmcjuicy,12,Fri Jul 17 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"There was a little blurb in a recent Grantland article that mentioned him:    At one point this week, I spoke to a former employee of Tom Thibodeau, and he couldn’t have been more complimentary about his ex-boss. Everyone around the league says Thibs is actually a funny guy away from basketball. As for the basketball side of things, I asked whether Thibs worked his employees as hard as Jimmy Butler, and I got a very diplomatic answer that downplayed my concern. There was only a little bit of PTSD-twitching before he assured me that Thibs isn’t quite what people imagine.  On the other hand, I was talking about Thibs with a different friend who’s worked with him, and he said the best part about him is that he’s exactly what people imagine. Jake Johnson’s Thibs fan fiction on NBA After Dark (41-minute mark) was cited specifically for its spiritual accuracy — a bench press in the basement, a TV for watching tape all day, and the occasional fast-food cheeseburger when he remembers to eat.  When I met a reporter who’s close to Thibs, I said that I hope he’s off relaxing at a resort and lowering his heart rate this summer. Answer: “Yeah. He’s not.”  I miss him so much. If he can’t coach this year, I want to crowdfund an online basketball show called MTV Thibs, where we watch Thibs in a basement for 30 minutes a week, lifting weights and watching tape. He could break down games, curse out bad rotations, interview old players, whatever. The only real requirement is that he goes hoarse by the end of each episode."
chicagobulls,3do1yu,reddit-er,6,Sat Jul 18 02:56:40 2015 UTC,"man he really does live for basketball. I hope he finds success in a new team, and have a front office that actually appreciates him"
chicagobulls,3do1yu,uwo1s,4,Sat Jul 18 07:58:40 2015 UTC,"As far as I know there hasn't been any verified rumors of him going anywhere. I assume he's going to wait until the next carousel, or when teams start firing coaching during the season. A few people on twitter have spotted him around Chicago though, so he's still in the area for now."
chicagobulls,3do1yu,asovermann,20,Fri Jul 17 21:25:24 2015 UTC,He loves chicago.
chicagobulls,3do1yu,zedrix_,8,Fri Jul 17 23:43:03 2015 UTC,I just hope he finds a good coaching job. I'd hate for him to just fade away into irrelevance.
chicagobulls,3do1yu,Eptics,12,Fri Jul 17 23:41:17 2015 UTC,when byron scott and mike woodson have coaching jobs you can trust thibs will find something.
chicagobulls,3do1yu,bbasara007,3,Sat Jul 18 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"Just wait until a team is interested enough to interview him.  I personally don't think Thibs makes any sense for a young team like LA. Thibs has a reputation for being slow to trust rookie/young players, it took Jimmy 3 years to get plays run for him.   He's also got a reputation for having no tolerance for young guys screwing up plays. In Zach Lowe's podcast about Thibs he discussed that Team USA players (all youngsters) were taken aback by how intense Thibs got on them when they missed a rotation.  Thibs is the ultimate win now coach. He's best on a team with veterans looking to make a deep playoff run right now. But most teams like that aren't looking to shake things up. OKC was the best team looking for a new coach but they pulled from the college ranks like Chicago did.  But on a rebuilding team, you need a coach that's patient with kids, willing to let kids play through stupid mistakes they make in games, willing to let kids play on even if they screw up on defense,  willing to lose games in order to get kids playing time so they can learn. None of that sounds like Thibodeau."

The quality of them varies by the seller, but most are pretty decent quality especially if you are getting a more basic home/away jersey. Just have to be careful that you either hang dry it or don't keep it in the dryer too long. I had a tune squad jersey that was in the dryer for too long and the front logo got messed up but it looked great."

chicagobulls,3dldk0,Pawnee20,6,Fri Jul 17 11:38:29 2015 UTC,"The negative posters say that if he has a poor game during Summer League, he sucks. But if he has a good game during Summer League, it means nothing. They won't be satisfied until he performs well during the regular season. Maybe there's no point to them even watching Summer League or posting about it, since they'll always say the same thing.  At the very least, I think the best thing to do is compare his SL performances this year to last year. He seems a lot stronger now than last year, which is a very good sign."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,sivob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:14:16 2015 UTC,"That's summer league in a nutshell. There's some players that kill in the summer league and go on to be great players and there's some that kill in the summer league then do nothing. However, it's better to see something good in SL play than nothing. At worst I think guys that do well in the SL become solid rotation players."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,Dr_Disaster,4,Fri Jul 17 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's definitely going to destroy people with these cuts, drives, and putbacks, but y'all are forgetting that he was doing this kind of stuff a lot last year in the few minutes he played: Exhibit A.  I don't think it's unreasonable that this kind of game can translate if we can swing the ball around and make openings for him."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,jkopecky,4,Sat Jul 18 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"Exhibit A hits the nail right on the head. He's done this, IN the NBA before folks. Just because Thibs' hates rookies doesn't mean McDermott can't play."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,imgurleen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"He has a knack for finishing around/above length. I'm confident he can be a primary bench scoring option at times, particularly if he has the right matchup."

chicagobulls,3dldk0,Doug_McDermott,7,Fri Jul 17 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"So I don't want to a debbie downer, but how sustainable is this?  Sure he can finish inside against fringe NBA roster candidates and draft picks, but is he going to be able to get those crazy putbacks against NBA power fowards and centers?  If he going to finish in transition against athletic wings?  Again, I love Doug and have high hopes for him, but I keep hoping to see him hit a bunch of jump shots in these highlight videos, which is what we really need, but there aren't a ton.  All that said, there are definitely some things he's shown that I think do translate to actual NBA action and they are skills I didn't think he had, so very impressive."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,demafrost,8,Fri Jul 17 06:36:56 2015 UTC,"Well it's possible he never plays like this in the NBA. But this can't be a bad sign. If he were unable to play like this in summer league then we'd have a clear problem. But the fact that he is doing well against sub-par talent should at least be some kind of a plus. I'm just really disappointed his three has been nonexistent. We have Butler and rose who can drive at will, we need spacing and Doug, despite making a lot of his shots, has been terrible from three."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,Cam8895,3,Fri Jul 17 13:46:30 2015 UTC,"It's a good question and one we won't know until he plays in meaningful games. All I cared to see was him kick his game into another gear once he got pissed off, it tells me the kid has some alpha, some dog in him. He'll hit threes, he'll come off curls and hit jumpers, but I'm more excited to see him work out of the post. His post-game is underrated, vastly underrated.  I think he can be an outstanding 6th man next season. He can come in and play the 2, 3, or 4 if we need. Hoiberg will find a way to get him on the court and get the ball in his hands."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,imgurleen,3,Fri Jul 17 14:34:04 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to see Doug in a role where he's the #1 scoring option, like he was in college. He thrives on it. Hopefully it translates to the regular season somehow."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,newchong,2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"I think it can translate. He was running these kinds of cuts to the hoop last year off the ball and we weren't really finding him often. Remember this game against the Pacers?  I think we're looking for something more like this one where he gets most of his points in catch and shoot situations, but makes good cuts (that here draw contact for free throws) and can run the break well. He's clearly improved his touch around the hoop so if we can find him inside he could do this consistently. If he can break out these moves on a regular basis it will give him a little more breathing room on the perimeter, especially if we're running a faster paced game and can get him the ball before the defense is set.   I don't think he's got the moves to create on his own, but I'm going to reserve judgement until I see how he operates in whatever offensive system Hoiberg constructs. Given that there will likely be lots of times when he's the fourth offensive option on the court behind Rose/Butler/Pau(or maybe Niko), he just needs to be dangerous enough to take advantage of holes made when those guys draw defenders and either get some easy buckets or draw enough defense to give those guys room to work."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,jkopecky,3,Fri Jul 17 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"People on this sub need to quit being so negative.  He isn't lighting it up from three his first few games back in real competition, but that doesn't mean shit.  He already proved to the world what he can do behind the 3 pt line in his college years and that's years of consistency.  And you know what he is doing right now?  He is doing what he needs to do to make his team win.  Summer League or not, putting the whole team on your shoulders is hard and impressive.  Will his great play here translate to the Nba?  It very well could.  Doug was never given more then garbage time minutes all last season.  So I don't like when people act like they know he can't do something like score against athletic wings, no one knows what he's gonna come out lookin like in regular season this year."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,redd1t4l1fe,-9,Fri Jul 17 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"eh, i remember before his knee injury last year he got some real minutes. he didn't know what the fuck he was doing out there. like a puppy just pissing everywhere."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,BunWhalen,5,Fri Jul 17 15:46:06 2015 UTC,He looked just fine to me against the Knicks and Pacers...
chicagobulls,3dldk0,imgurleen,5,Fri Jul 17 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"You're delusional, he never got any real minutes.  A flash here, a flash there, and he has hit the weight room hard since then, which also makes a huge difference in the nba.  No one better be saying shit about dougie until he at least gets as many minutes as they gave to Marquis Teague, cuz he hasn't had close to that much opportunity."

Maybe, just maybe, there's a chance that his knee was bothering him prior to the surgery and then afterwards he started playing much better but was already out of Thibs' set rotation..."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,rowseyna,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:13:37 2015 UTC,i could take that. i guess i more of meant off the ball was when he looked like he didn't know what he was doing. shoulda clarified. ah well.
chicagobulls,3dldk0,BunWhalen,4,Fri Jul 17 17:49:30 2015 UTC,It felt so good when he hit that three!  And then the put-back when he went to the ground...!  His ability to finish and his touch around the rim/in the paint are really incredible.
chicagobulls,3dldk0,rowseyna,-11,Fri Jul 17 18:00:31 2015 UTC,His ability to finish and his touch around the rim/in the paint are really incredible.   He was playing against rookies and D-Leaguers. Settle down.
chicagobulls,3dldk0,babyfarmer,6,Fri Jul 17 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"Settle down?  I don't give a fuck who he's playing against, he has good finishing ability when presented with an opportunity and his touch close to the basket is great.  Those abilities won't be any different regardless of who he's playing against.  Maybe the frequency of them might change, but he's not going to magically lose his touch or forget how to make tough layups."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,rowseyna,-10,Fri Jul 17 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, settle down. His ability may be the same, but the level of competition isn't. It's not as easy to finish against real NBA players as it is in Summer League."

Summer League means something to the guy out there trying to develop himself, in McDermott's case it's his confidence and in Vander Blue's case (and others), it's to earn a damn spot on a roster and contribute to a team.  I've never seen McDermott get this scrappy, which bodes well coming into next season knowing he isn't afraid of contact."
chicagobulls,3dldk0,Aldnoah,2,Fri Jul 17 10:01:05 2015 UTC,He didn't play last season genius.  All this negativity on here needs to stop.  He is playing incredibly well.  Do you think Brooks or Hinrich came into summer league that they would score more than 30 points in that game?  No.
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,PicardsBaldSpot,26,Fri Jul 17 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"McBuckets has had a very solid summer league performance, although the surprise has been that he is dominating from the post with some great turnarounds and turn and drives. He's got a sweet leg kick in his turnaround j, kind of looks like a combination of Jordan getting space and dirk going up. He has attacked the basket with a fury, and though he looks almost identical to last year, he seems to be much stronger as he keeps finishing some impressive and 1s and even had a very athletic tip in flying across the basket. His three point shot, however, has not been present, and so lots of discussion has ensued. Seems like it's a rhythm and adjusting to his strength thing, but some naysayers are sending him to China over this.   Portis has been a huge surprise. Not just that he's talented enough to look good in summer league, or how he truly does have a motor like Noah, but in how polished he looks. Every announcer comments that he just doesn't look like a rookie. He is still pretty inconsistent night to night with his numbers, but his effort is always there and he doesn't get down on himself for missing shots. Actually seems possible he'll earn some minutes this year. His biggest opportunity might be that he is nowhere near in shape to play his style of play for very long at the speed of the NBA. He is shooting over 50% in threes, so it seems like he may be more of a stretch 5 than we were led to believe.   Bairstow has had arguably the most impressive summer league, he's in the top 5 for blocks and rebounds, and has hit several threes. Love the kid, seems like he might work himself into being an NBA journeyman as an excellent 12th man.   Vander Blue has impressed with his speed, his handles and his ability to get to the basket and some nifty passing on pick and roles. Another underrated Marquette product, he looks close to being NBA ready, but he doesn't seem to have a jump shot yet and can really get stuck under the basket lacking the strength to force contact and fight through it.   Galloway has displayed a nice three point shot. Garrett has made his presence felt, though sometimes as negatively as positively. None of these guys look to me like they'll get an invite to our camp, let alone a spot on our roster."
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,Guidonculous,5,Fri Jul 17 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"Man you went above and beyond there, thanks! Great summary. I wonder about Blue, he never had a good jump shot so I gotta wonder if he's ever gonna have one."
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,theoneobamamoma,5,Fri Jul 17 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"What do you mean when you said,""His biggest opportunity might be that he's nowhere near in shape to play his style of play for very long at the speed of the NBA""? Did you mean obstacle? Cause that sentence makes no sense. And if you mean obstacle, I totally disagree."
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,Guidonculous,4,Fri Jul 17 15:12:47 2015 UTC,"I mean that he has gotten himself gassed a lot. In his best game, hoiberg mentioned he had to pull himself out of the game three times. NBA games are basically an all out sprint, faster still than summer league games. It seems clear that portis intends to be moving more than anyone else on the court. I'm saying that he is not in good enough shape to pull that off yet."
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,theoneobamamoma,2,Fri Jul 17 15:26:40 2015 UTC,Oh ok I got you. I thought you meant like size and strength
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,kinnaston,3,Fri Jul 17 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"I think he did mean obstacle, and if so, he's right. Portis has had to come out of games due to exhaustion. Hoiberg admitted as after the first game. And if you watch Portis near the end of games, you can see he isn't playing with as much explosion or ferocity. But he'll improve. His stamina will come if he continues to work in the offseason, which we're all pretty confident he will. Stamina should be priority number one for him this offseason, though, because with his skill set, I would not be surprised to see his number called this coming season."
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,imjoeyournot,2,Fri Jul 17 15:28:49 2015 UTC,"In terms of business, "" opportunity"" is often used in place of ""needs improvement"". Basically, a polite way of saying it's an opportunity for someone to get better in whatever area. That's what I thought he meant."
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,ArthurDentsTea,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"You should also note that McBuckets can easily dunk now, something he could not do last summer league."
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,rowseyna,2,Fri Jul 17 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"He could easily dunk last summer, too.  He just didn't do it during the SL.  Here's his pre-draft workout from last May:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeZR5YevSxw"
chicagobulls,3dmeyq,ArthurDentsTea,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:49 2015 UTC,Being able to and then having the confidence to do it during a game are two different things.

He's like and undersized two guard, but not Aaron brooks undersized. His shooting has been great from what I've seen.  Blue is good at getting to the hoop, but is ball dominant and wouldn't fit on our team.  It also goes without saying that Doug is the reincarnation of Larry Legend. Good Game and more Bulls basketball"
chicagobulls,3dl4p9,imgurleen,9,Fri Jul 17 04:04:32 2015 UTC,"Douggie admitted that he was playing soft and getting too down on himself. Took the game over and got aggressive in the second half -- I love it, good for the kid!!!"

chicagobulls,3dl4p9,Nikola_Mirotic,7,Fri Jul 17 13:59:51 2015 UTC,Does it worry anyone that Dougie can't get a three going yet?
chicagobulls,3dl4p9,snowcone_wars,6,Fri Jul 17 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters all that much.  He was something like 50% from 3 last year's summer league, and then struggled because he never saw the ball enough to find a rhythm.  Shooting in the summer league doesn't necessarily translate to shooting during the regular season.  Also, when shooters go through cold spells, it's great for them to be able to get baskets closer to the bucket to rebuild up that rhythm, and he's showing that, given the opportunity, he might be able to do that in the league when his 3 might not be falling."
chicagobulls,3dl4p9,Guidonculous,7,Fri Jul 17 04:01:41 2015 UTC,"We know his stroke is pure, apparently he hit 30 straight before yesterday's game. He does seem to have his arms a bit further out when shooting in games recently, it's probably just a lot of adjustments happening at once. He's put on some bulk, he's trying to play with more pace, he seems to be trying to establish more of a fleshed out offensive game and is thus looking to drive much more, it's a new coach in a new system, and most important, he feels pressure from himself to perform and make the most of these opportunities.   I'm concerned enough to think it may be an issue this season. I don't think it'll be an issue for his career."
chicagobulls,3dl4p9,photo_matt,2,Fri Jul 17 05:16:00 2015 UTC,"He gained muscle. I can imagine that totally fucks with your shot technique as You need to apply way less force than before. He often hits the front of the rim, seems to over compensate"
chicagobulls,3dl4p9,snowcone_wars,2,Fri Jul 17 12:41:26 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, adding or losing muscle really fucks with you, really in any sport that requires a deft touch.  Judging by how much muscle he put on, I would have actually been surprised if he had come out knocking down 3s in the summer league.  Almost certainly just needs a bit of time to adjust to his new body."
chicagobulls,3dl4p9,Deadmau69,5,Fri Jul 17 17:41:14 2015 UTC,I think its more of a rhythm thing
chicagobulls,3dl4p9,Elmos_Voice,3,Fri Jul 17 03:53:15 2015 UTC,He's doing everything else well so i'm not that worried.

chicagobulls,3dmgbv,photo_matt,3,Fri Jul 17 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"Probably no one to the regular season roster other than those who already have contracts, McDermott, Portis, and Bairstow.  The Bulls consider themselves contenders, if they sign anyone else they want veterans.  Don't forget they also have Mirotic in his second year, they really don't have room for more young players."
chicagobulls,3dmgbv,wjbc,4,Fri Jul 17 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"Uhh... Dougie and Portis already have deals.  So does Bairstow.  So does Felicio (through camp).

chicagobulls,3dkrw3,jonesb32,3,Fri Jul 17 01:56:48 2015 UTC,Bairstow w/ three early blocks! I'm not so sure about his future with the Bulls (or his spot in the deep rotation) but I really like him. He's a high-energy player who has definitely gotten better since last year. I think that he could find a niche and have a nice career.

chicagobulls,3dkrw3,alba7or,2,Fri Jul 17 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"His physicality overall is lacking, you're right. But he's quick... maybe stick him on backup 2's until he bulks up? Idk, I just want him to get some more minutes this season. Riding the bench more won't help."
chicagobulls,3dkrw3,GiraffeHigh,2,Fri Jul 17 03:31:15 2015 UTC,He's not quick but he's smart. He'll figure it out if he gets enough playing time.

chicagobulls,3dkrw3,Roheed23,2,Fri Jul 17 02:55:31 2015 UTC,Okay okay.  So I was kind of looking it up while watching the game so this might not be that accurate.  To get a Canadian citizenship you must be a permanent residence or live in Canada for more then 4 years regardless of marriage to one of us Canadians.  So you CAN get dual citizenship but you'd have to live here for awhile.

chicagobulls,3disum,aboycandream,7,Thu Jul 16 19:06:28 2015 UTC,Morrison was also like 28 and the 3rd overall pick.  It's nice that we got a player at 22 who seems to be doing very well so far.  22nd picks generally don't end up being more than rotation guys / role players but there's reason to be optimistic that Bobby might be better than that.

chicagobulls,3disum,rowseyna,7,Thu Jul 16 20:14:09 2015 UTC,Good to see that both Bobby & Bairstow have some range on their jump shots.  This will help provide some spacing for Rose & Jimmy to penetrate.

chicagobulls,3disum,Doug_McDermott,3,Thu Jul 16 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Taj isn't worth anything to Denver though they need young talent.  If Taj went to Denver he would only make them a slightly better lottery team and might hurt their chances at a top pick.  Then his stock will likely continue to drop and he'll leave in free agency.  Ty has his issues but Denver can get better value than that, unless we do some kind of three way trade where we send Taj elsewhere and that 3rd team sends Denver some assets"

I can't remember the last time we have had a guard off of the bench that can facilitate. We could also play small ball lineup of: Ty, Rose, Jimmy, Niko, and Jo if we wanted to run.   He was also a +40% 3pt shooter for the beginning of his career when the Nuggets had more spacing. He has his issues, but I believe he is a hard worker and that he wants to win.  Rose/Ty/Brooks  JimmyGBuckets/Snell/ETwaun  Dunleavy/McDermott  Niko/Portis/Bairstow  Noah/Pau/Nazr(did he retire?)  That roster is championship quality. Taj is a great player, but given our incredible depth at his position, he is more valuable to other teams. I wouldnt be opposed to a Brooks/Taj/1st for Ty/Nurkic."

chicagobulls,3disum,alba7or,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"This seems like small news for the present, it's unlikely that he can keep this up through the season, and he probably won't see the court much anyway.   This seems like very big news for the future. Every reason to believe he can continue to develop that part of his game, his shooting stroke is very smooth, if oddly timed. Seems like future lineups featuring he and Niko are going to be no joke shooting from anywhere on the court.

Sure he's not someone who should be playing a lot of minutes, but if he can play well defensively (I know that's an if after last season) he can still be a decent three and D guy for the bench unit. He shot .345 last season which is fairly respectable.  I think as long as Hoiberg gets the ball out of his hands faster when he's running point he'll be a decent contributor to the bench unit. It's the dribbling down the first ten seconds of the shot clock that make me want to murder him."

With both the Rose 1, and the Rose 5, I find that they grip the court nicely (I play exclusively indoors, I got a pair of really thick and heavy LeBrons for beating up outdoors) AND more importantly they grip my foot nicely.   Obviously this is just my personal experience, and I have heard enough complaints about them that I am not going to pretend that those complaints aren't valid, but nonetheless my experience with them has been really good.  Maybe my positive experience coincides with how thoroughly I tie my shoes. I tighten them at every single shoelace hole, from the front of the shoe all the way to the back. Then I jog/stretch/warm up a bit, and I actually stop to re-tie my shoes to cover any slack created by my movement.   Either way, while I do agree that there must be at least SOME validation to the buzz that the shoes have their issues, I also think that it is possible to have a really good experience with them.   Plus, I think that the color way I have them in looks pretty dope.  (http://clavelmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a-closer-look-at-the-adidas-bad-dreams-collection-2-640x640.jpg)"

Theyre also incredibly durable and light weight. Obviously im from chicago and a huge Bulls\Rose fan so i have all his shoes. The problem with his shoes is that theyre hit and miss. When they hit theyre really good, 4.5s specifically, but when they miss they really miss. I specifically hate the 1,s with the 5 or 6 circles on the bottom of the shoes. Thats just a recipie for rolled ankles. I think they got away from designing really quality shoes when they desided to make them as light as possible. Thats just my opinion though, i really loved all the shoes that came out in the 00's and am stuggling to like the new wave of shoes."

I can't wait to see a faster attack with JB, Rose, Snell, Niko, etc.   My only concern, which might be unfounded, is that we will completely abandon the half-court offense that Thibs ran. It certainly didn't work as our primary sets and became predictable, but Thibs wasn't exactly wrong when he said that playoff basketball is often run at that pace. I think that there will be numerous times that that slower, post-oriented offense will be a nice wrinkle, especially as a way to slow the other team if they have momentum. Since the depth of our bigs is a big advantage we have, why not go big in some instances?  However, in short, I'm definitely excited about this offense."

Despite the fact that Jimmy has stated he asked for those minutes and is closer to Thibs than most of his other former players.

chicagobulls,3di7nw,Bob2456,7,Thu Jul 16 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"I have a new one based on recent experience:   Jimmy Butler is at least as good as Kawhi Leonard, maybe better.  Certainly less injury prone."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,maxelrod,3,Thu Jul 16 16:56:51 2015 UTC,kawhi is more versatile defensively just due to his body. he can guard 1 - 4. but he's not as aggressive offensively. not sure if he ever will be.   jimmy has shown the penchant for actively looking for his shot.
chicagobulls,3di7nw,B3L0W_Z3R0,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's a wash on the defensive end.  Both players guard the opposing teams best wing and keep them as low as it's possible to keep a best player down.  On offense, I think Jimmy is a better jump shooter, especially from outside, but I really like Kawahi's touch around the rim and his little floater/faceup hookshots.  Overall, I agree with you.  If Leonard develops and outside jumper or Butler develops more of a post game (I know he tried a bit this year) they could edge one another out."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,_allFallsDown,0,Thu Jul 16 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure about that. I would give Kawhi the edge on Defense, although it's close. Plus He's putting up 16.5 ppg (48%), 7.2 rpg, and 2.5 assists with only 32 mpg. Give him a couple extra minutes and he's scoring just as much as Jimmy, if not more."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,airoderinde,5,Thu Jul 16 17:42:29 2015 UTC,Butler is a much more refined offensive weapon than kawi. butler also has proven to shoot on insane efficiency WHILE being the #1 option and attracting a lot of attention. kawi scores less on less efficiency while being within one of the most successful offensive systems in the league.
chicagobulls,3di7nw,augiemarched,2,Thu Jul 16 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely would not say Butler has a much more refined game. Butler also isn't that much more efficient. Butler TS% is .583 and Kawhi is .567. Also, like I said Jimmy is scoring more but also playing 7 minutes more per game. Their offensive stats are pretty similar, but Kawhi averages 5 more rebounds and has won DPOY. I don't understand how it's such a popular opinion that Jimmy is better. There is at least an argument to be made."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,scassett,4,Thu Jul 16 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"I would argue it's exactly because Pop doesn't play his players big minutes. Over the past two years, Jimmy has played two more regular season games than Kawhi (67 in 14' and 65 in 15' to 66 in 14' and 65 in 15'). I assume that when both of them start they are relatively healthy. So, Kawhi's lack of minutes is most likely due to Pop's coaching style."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,augiemarched,2,Thu Jul 16 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"How do you come up with that ridiculous claim? They've played almost the exact same number of games the last 2 years, and Jimmy has averaged almost 10 more minutes per game. That clearly indicates the exact opposite conclusion: that Jimmy has been played more minutes because of Pop's coaching style vs Thibodeau's."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,maskedfox007,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"Leonard is the most overrated player in the league. People talk about him like he's top 10 and a bona fide superstar when he wasn't an All-Star nor an All-NBA player last year. He flat out is not that good, and his hype is merely fabricated by Spurs fans that are getting insecure that they don't have an elite something."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,B3L0W_Z3R0,3,Fri Jul 17 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"he is an elite defender (and better than Butler on that).  he's not a great offensive player and creates a healthy amount of his looks on transition opportunities (some of which he's created with good defense though). I haven't seen many people claim he's top 10 or even say he's better than Jimmy though.   If I needed a stop on any 1-4, I would probably take Leonard over Butler. But if I needed a bucket, I'd take Butler over Leonard in a second."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,bbasara007,11,Thu Jul 16 20:59:17 2015 UTC,Derrick Rose is a top 5 PG.

chicagobulls,3di7nw,Blubalz,13,Fri Jul 17 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Butler is the best SG in the game.  Not only did he vastly improve his offensive production, his defense is still arguably the best at his position.  He bodies up well, has more strength than what you would expect from his frame, and his quick hands and length make him one of the best at stripping the ball cleanly on a drive than I've seen in a long time.  Offensively, I think this year he showed that he has the tools to be the best scoring SG in the game.  His FG% greatly improved, his 3pt% was respectable, and he showed aggressiveness in getting to the hoop, especially during the first half of the season and got to the FT line, where he shot very well at 80%+.  Jimmy had a lot more offensive tools around him than James Harden on the Rockets.  Harden was tasked a lot with being the ball handler as well, so he had a much higher usage % than Jimmy.  In comparing the 2, I would say that Jimmy takes higher quality shots.  If he were to get the same volume of shots (which is tough on a team with DRose and Pau Gasol) I think he could be averaging near 30pts/game...and do it efficiently.  His triple-threat has definitely improved to the point you can't sag off him...which makes his powerful drives to the hoop much more effective.  When it comes to team basketball, at the end of the day I'd take Jimmy G Buckets every time.  He could score as much and handle the ball as much as Harden, but that's not his game."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,thehami,11,Fri Jul 17 01:30:19 2015 UTC,I think you're wrong.
chicagobulls,3di7nw,Blubalz,20,Thu Jul 16 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"There is not way Jimmy is even close to Harden offensively, sorry.   He could score as much and handle the ball as much as Harden, but that's not his game.   Jimmy's ball handling/ability to create his own shot is lightyears behind Harden. His passing is not as good either.  There's more to offense than just shooting. Even as a shooter, Harden took 49% of his 3's off the dribble, where Jimmy only took 8.2%.  Jimmy plays his role well, but he is not a primary ball handler, and he can't do half of the things Harden can do on that end of the court.  I hate Harden, but the guy has serious skills offensively. He's a top 3 scorer in the league while averaging 7 ast per game. I know this is an unpopular opinion thread, but it's flat out delusional to say Jimmy is as good as Harden offensively."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,Jared524,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's as good as Harden offensively, but I'd say that he's closer to Harden on offense than Harden is to him on Defense, making Jimmy the better overall player."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,STICKSTICKITY,2,Thu Jul 16 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll concede he's not as good as Harden offensively, but to say he's not even close, and call him lightyears behind Harden is blatantly wrong.  My opinion was infused with a touch of homerism, but I don't think you give Jimmy's offensive presence enough credit.  Especially in the stretches where Rose and MDJ were out."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,SaucyMustard,7,Thu Jul 16 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"I think AB444 is more concerned with you not giving Harden enough credit. I think Jimmy is an excellent player, with a growing offensive presence, but Harden during the regular season was a freaking menace. It's not a slight against Jimmy that we're not putting him at that level."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,_finite_jest,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"Disagree, I'm not completely sold on Butler yet as being a #1 guy on a championship team. I see him better as a 1B or a Scottie Pippen-role. Who knows though that could change this upcoming season since Jimmy so far had only 1 really good season  I'd say he's the #3 SG right now though"
chicagobulls,3di7nw,hankbaumbach,3,Thu Jul 16 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"Even with his combination of defense and respectable offense you'd put him at #3?  On offense alone, I can see #3 behind Harden and Thompson (regular season Klay Thompson that is)...but if you take into account he's a top defender at his position, do you still see him as the #3 SG in the game?"
chicagobulls,3di7nw,ssl5b,3,Thu Jul 16 19:27:41 2015 UTC,Well honestly I should have wrote that he's 2-3 best SG. Sometimes I think it's Klay as the 2nd best and sometimes it's Jimmy. So I guess I'd say Thompson and Jimmy are equal but Butler is a better defender and Klay is a little better on offense
chicagobulls,3di7nw,_finite_jest,2,Thu Jul 16 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"I hear ya.  I would dare say that Jimmy is a more consistent offensive performer than Klay.  But Klay can catch fire and damn when he's hot, he's hot."

chicagobulls,3di7nw,Kozzer,7,Thu Jul 16 16:39:20 2015 UTC,We need some kind of defensive anchor in our starting lineup.
chicagobulls,3di7nw,_finite_jest,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:45 2015 UTC,That's what Jimmy is for. Plus Pau can guard the paint pretty well. Plus we can bring in Snell if we need another wing defender.
chicagobulls,3di7nw,footballfutbolsoccer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"I think that'd be great, too.  Here are the reasons I lean towards starting Noah over Pau:  For starters, Noah is a great defender and Pau is not.  With weak defenders in MDJ and Niko at the F spots, I feel that the unit will need a strong defensive C to not just surrender points with basically no resistance.  Additionally, with both forwards being great shooters, I think Noah's excellent passing would mesh very well with an open court and great shooting.  Finally, Noah is the box-out king and an A1 rebounder.  This unit needs that with the C being basically the only guy in that starting unit to operate in the paint.  Similarly, Pau works great on a second unit with Taj.  Taj can be the defensive force on the interior where Pau struggles.  Additionally, with Pau's excellent range for a C, he helps keep/provide/enhance the spacing necessary for that lineup.  Taj can't provide that kind of spacing.  Taj's only offensive prowess really comes in the post.  Pau can work out from further away and that allows Taj more room to operate.  I know about Noah and Taj's injured past, but Pau is 35 years old now.  I think having him come off the bench would be great for preserving him so he can slay in the playoffs.  His offense is perfect for killing reserve big men on opposing teams and with our depth, he won't need to play as many minutes as last year.  Really, Pau, Noah, and Taj should all be able to play less minutes this year as opposed to last with the continue progression of Niko and the addition of Portis."
chicagobulls,3di7nw,marmot1101,2,Thu Jul 16 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I partly agree. I understand that Noah is a better defender than Pau, but not to the point where it's worth starting him. He absolutely could not score last season even when he was wide open. Although Niko is not a big presence in the paint, he still is a solid rebounder. Benching Pau might take him out of his rhythm. He was great in the 1st quarter of a lot of games."

chicagobulls,3dgshn,rowseyna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:57:41 2015 UTC,I think Galloway has been more impressive than McGee.  I also think his game has a better chance of actually translating to the NBA than McGee's.
chicagobulls,3dgshn,AidsoLoL,3,Thu Jul 16 14:28:55 2015 UTC,McGee is more deserving imo
chicagobulls,3dgshn,imgurleen,3,Thu Jul 16 06:38:16 2015 UTC,Agreed. McGee's shot is wet.
chicagobulls,3dgshn,rowseyna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:30:49 2015 UTC,"I'd take Felicio, Galloway, and Blue over McGee."
chicagobulls,3dgshn,AidsoLoL,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:30 2015 UTC,Why would you take Felicio a big. With which we have plenty. I see no need has played fine just we have absolutely no need for him.  McGee has played minutes but has hit big shows with great efficiency.   52% FG - 55.6% 3PT - 2.5 RPG - 1.0 APG - 9.3 PPG  Vander Blue hasn't hit a 3 and is shooting 36 %. He rebounds well but I can't imagine that will translate pretty well. We also don't need that from our 3rd String PG.  Galloway has good vision and has made some really nice plays but he lacks on defense and makes stupid fouls. Turnover rate is fairly high but it is Summer League. He is shooting 40% and 36%. Kirk last year shot 34% from three last year with a lot better defense. I don't see what he brings to the team.  McGee can shoot the ball extremely well and knows Hoiberg system. Not that he can really contribute to the team he is by far in my mind the choice you would make if you were to pick him up.
chicagobulls,3dgshn,rowseyna,2,Thu Jul 16 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"I like Felicio's potential.  I know we have plenty of bigs right now, but look at the future.  Pau is 35.  Noah is a FA after this season.  Taj only has two years left and is coming off of surgery.  I wouldn't want Felicio for this year.  I'd want him just as a developmental project and see if he can become a player.  He already has the size for it.  Let him compete with Bairstow and see which one has the better potential to develop moving forward.  McGee is obviously one hell of a shooter and has been on a roll lately from deep.  No denying that.  However, he's a poor rebounder and his passing and defense have both been poor.  Basically he's been a great shooter and nothing else.  At 6'1""-6'2"", I don't think that's going to workout.  He has to be a much better passer to play PG.  Basically he seems to be a tiny SG who can really shoot it but not do anything else well, especially defend.  Blue isn't a great shooter, obviously.  He's been inefficient as a scorer through four games.  However, he's much more athletic than McGee and has better size (a legit 6'4"").  No, he'd never be able to actually average 5.3 rpg in the league, but I honestly do think he's twice the rebounder that McGee is.  His athleticism and size could make for him being at least a decent rebounding G, for what that's worth.  But it's not only Blue's rebounding, size, and athleticism advantages.  He looks like a much better passer than McGee, too.  He seems genuinely capable of developing into an actual NBA PG and has the size to where he could make it at that spot.  He can score, he can pass, and he has great size and athleticism.  Just looking at that as potential, I could see him in the league as PG well before McGee.  Galloway has far-and-away had the best vision/passing out of the three and it's not really all that close.  The dude has been a play-maker, and that's what I'd look for in a potential PG.  I don't think his defense has been all that bad and yes, he's fouled way too much.  Hell, he's leading the team with 1.8 spg.  His defense has been fine.  I could live with that right now.  His TO rate has been higher than McGee's, but that's because Galloway has actually been the primary PG on this team (with Garrett) while McGee hasn't handled the ball much at all (telling).  Galloway has legit PG skills.  His shooting is fine, not on McGee's level, but serviceable.  Again, it's not about what he adds to the team right now.  It's about future potential.  Kirk is done after this year.  Maybe with another year or two of seasoning, Galloway becomes a legit third-string or backup PG.  It's not crazy."
chicagobulls,3dgshn,AidsoLoL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, well for me. Right now I'm thinking screw potential, we don't need potential we need someone who might have serviceable minutes in this year or next. McGee with his height could be a good asset or a terrible one, but his shooting really makes me want them to take that chance for the 15th roster spot.  I think there is no place for Blue, a rebounding PG to me who doesn't do a great deal else isn't what i'm looking for. Felicio I like  as a future rotation prospect but yeah he'd be better off in the D-League or staying in Brazil and improving.   Galloway I admit I like his steals are a lot higher than I thought they'd be. I'm interested in how he has got them as I've seen some lacking D from him so far. It could well be just the stupid Summer League turnovers that happen so often that he seems to grab. Anyway.  McGee for me would be a clear favourite if he wasn't 6'2, but frankly that won't change and he would be charged with running the point as we have no James Harden who can run it meaning we can play a specialist at PG. Frankly, I don't see anyone joining and giving us minutes. Felicio may stay but I can imagine seeing him in the D-League."

chicagobulls,3dgshn,setyoursightsnorth,2,Thu Jul 16 04:27:59 2015 UTC,Watching him play for Marquette was a privledge. His junior year when we went to the elite eight. His three game winning shots in March. It was beautiful. I hope he makes it.

chicagobulls,3dh8i9,BobB3,4,Thu Jul 16 16:20:33 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen this summer league, Portis is going to be a great fit under Fred. He runs the floor extremely well, and he's got a similar shooting style to KG (no he's not KG, but still similar style) - which is being able to post up, then make a move inside and rise up for the jumper. If he can hit that shot consistently, he'll be a contributor from Day 1 I bet."
chicagobulls,3dh8i9,Calicagoan,2,Thu Jul 16 07:46:51 2015 UTC,"I like his cockiness. He just posts-up everything and instantly, keeping his man off balance. I hope his confidence holds up when he goes up against better and stronger defenders."

chicagobulls,3ddqk0,detectivejamescarter,13,Wed Jul 15 16:01:23 2015 UTC,Definitely. I think Joakim Noah was a big part of this award. He is always trying to help fight the violence in Chicago. Love that guy.
chicagobulls,3ddqk0,AcrossFromWhere,24,Wed Jul 15 16:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. In my law school mediation classes at Northwestern a ""Cease Fire"" guy came in to talk to us about mediating disputes among gang members in order to break the cycle of retaliatory shootings. He talked about Joakim non-stop. About his influence, how giving he was with his time, how much it meant for the kids that he would talk to them.  That's why whenever I see trade rumors I think ""no thanks.""  Wouldn't trade him for anyone honestly, because he will do more good for Chicago than any younger, cheaper replacement. And, at the end of the day I'm a Bulls fan because I love Chicago, not because of the entity owned by Reinsdorf and Co.   I'd rather have Joakim as a lifelong Chicago, and Chicago Bulls, ambassador than another championship. Probably sounds crazy, but what is being a fan but rooting for glory and honor for a team representing a city or state or region?  I'd rather the glory and honor associated with bringing peace to a torn up city than the glory and honor associated with beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in seven games in the NBA Finals."
chicagobulls,3ddqk0,Marenum,7,Wed Jul 15 16:48:24 2015 UTC,"Great post. That's why I love Derrick Rose so much and I'll always have his back.

Yeah, every year, but not at the expense of the city. I'm also one of the people that believe Jo still has value to the Bulls on the court, so maybe I'm just a softie."

Bairstow seems the most unlikely of contributors for a deep team like the Bulls. It seemed difficult to understand last season why he even was on the team or not in the D-league for the rare playing time. And for a team that basically never scrimmaged. Still, Bairstow signed a modest deal with a partially guaranteed second year for this season. And he could be worth a further look with a coach who regards his aggressive play."
chicagobulls,3dh1l7,pumpyourbrakeskid,3,Thu Jul 16 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"I mean. Look. Noah, Gasol, Portis, Gibson. Mirotic can play 4. Nazr is still around. I love Bairstow, I think he is a very intelligent player, and he has shown that he can knock down a three in summer league. But he is nothing but a third stringer on this roster. Which is fine :)"
