So I see what you're saying, but unfortunately this tournament was broadcast in Chinese I wasn't really able to take in much more than the visual presentation. I did discuss at the end of the article the skill of the players involved. There are other aspects i could have discussed like the weird tournament format, but that wasn't really relevant to the overall point.

I get that it was in Chinese and you could only give surface-level impressions, but they were still surface level impressions and not particularly insightful.   Sites like Salon, the Daily Beast, etc, traffic in opinionated articles that explain and explore (especially from a feminist viewpoint) news topics and events. That's great, and the title made it sound like one of those. When I saw what the article actually was, it was definitely less analysis than I'd hoped.   It seems like a case of mismanaged expectations. I read the title and full article and didn't really get ""op-ed"" out of it, and I'm a journalist.

SRSGaming,3e3n16,carlfish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:25:36 2015 UTC,"When I say that, I mostly mean its success is due primarily due to Blizzard just pushing the heck out of a pretty generic and uninvented product."
SRSGaming,3e3n16,Khanstant,3,Wed Jul 22 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"Generic and un-inventive? They're the only digital card game on the market with an intuitive and well designed UI along with an intuitive card game to back it. The game feels designed around being a digital card game that takes advantage of it's medium, rather than an adaptation of a paper card game. On top of that, Blizzard have since WC3 crafted a pretty specific art style and set of characters. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of Blizzard since they become an entirely different developer in every way after say between WC2-WC3, but calling them generic is a bit silly considering how definitive their shit has been. Have you listened to any of the developer's talk about their work on Hearthstone?   I'm not sure what your point ultimately is besides that you don't like Hearthstone. It's an extremely well-polished, actively developed game with wide appeal and addictive design.  If there's any legitimate reason to discount Hearthstone as a competitive avenue, it's the role of RNG, which is a ""problem"" inherent to any deckbuilding game."
SRSGaming,3e3n16,tickthegreat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:35:19 2015 UTC,Have you not played Magic 2013/2014? o.o
SRSGaming,3e3n16,tickthegreat,3,Wed Jul 22 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"I have.  All computerised versions of Magic suffer from the same problem. Because everything in the game down to phase transitions can potentially be responded to, the game boils down to a lot of waiting to get permission from your opponent to continue.  (In paper magic most of this permission is done through convention and non-verbal cues, making the game feel a lot more streamlined in person. Unless you're playing against that MTGO-bred ""sure!"" guy Day9 and Chris Kluwe were making fun of in the last Spellslingers.)  The Magic 20XX interface is also really fiddly and unforgiving, and the number of games I would lose to avoidable misplays was an equal reason for me giving up playing it.  Finally, Magic 2013 and 2014 have the distinction of being the only non-hobbyist-written iPad apps I ever uninstalled because they were still crashing on launch months after an OS or device update rendered them unusable.  I installed the Magic Origins game the other week, but it's just staring at me from my home screen almost entirely unplayed."
SRSGaming,3e3n16,ArabIDF,0,Wed Jul 22 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"No, I have not.  Below is a tangent I originally typed, before realizing it had nothing at all to do with what you asked, but it got quite long before I noticed.  I'm not sure which one I played. One of my major issues was that it was one that was made, instead of the way to play Magic on a computer. I really didn't dig whichever one it was, it looked like a kind of crappy simulation of if you were playing magic with paper, in the matrix loading room. Plus, there are like a billion magic cards, but this one you got like 100 and could buy some others. It's not like they were actually modeling the card characters or anything, just flipping around scans of cards -- it just annoyed me.   Honestly, I think Hearthstone is a better ComputerCTCG mechanically than Magic anyway. I like the way they manage mana better and think the turn structure flows more smoothly. They also make cards that take advantage of the digital-ness and do things that would be tedious or impossible to enforce in a physical card game. Magic also has the boon and disadvantage of over a decade of cards to draw from. On one hand, that's great and provides so much variety and potential depth -- but it's also a burden. In Hearthstone, you've pretty much seen all of the cards and know generally what they do and how they'll probably be used.   I also tried Pokemon TCG's client, which is one of the worst programs I've ever installed on this machine. If anything, I liked it because it really demonstrates how weak the mechanics of the pokemon TCG are. Never actually played it growing up, I was just a dutiful consumer-child."

I honestly doubt mainstream video gamers with budgets in the tens or even hundreds of millions are going to be at the forefront of creating a better more peaceful world.

But also, I'm not against violence in games AT ALL, only in instances where the combat often feels unnecessary and unrewarding (assasin's creed, tomb raider, bioshock etc.).

The alien was ALWAYS hunting you and ALWAYS waiting to jump out and eat you no matter how little noise you made, how slowly you moved, how carefully you planned your steps.  It felt less like the game was punishing you for inattentiveness but like the game was daring you to play it. Like a game of perpetual slaphands that lasted more than 20 hours of backtracking and mindless human AI.  I couldn't help but wonder how much more interesting and engrossing the game would have been if it instead sent the alien as punishment for screwing up. What if you fired a gun and the alien showed up in your section of the map. Or you started up a generator and the unstoppable alien would drop down and start ruining your day. What if walking around let you explore the environment at will but getting attacked by an android made so much noise the alien had no choice but to get nosy.  The very fact that the alien was around felt like a punishment because it dragged gameplay to a standstill. And I'm sure the developers thought the alien's existence itself was the gameplay."

SRSGaming,3do9d9,skeletorsass,0,Sat Jul 18 04:56:56 2015 UTC,Honest question: did you game before 5ish years ago? And what about most console games?
SRSGaming,3do9d9,SrWiggles,9,Sat Jul 18 05:08:20 2015 UTC,"15 years ago people who cared about framerate were gaming at 120fps on CRTs. So this whole 60fps thing isn't exactly a new invention, it's actually more a limit brought on by the onslaught of LCDs. The old consoles (NES, SNES, etc.) also ran frequently at 60fps."
SRSGaming,3do9d9,grumbel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"From the advice I've heard competitive players give, I was under the impression that CRT vs. LCD was a matter of screen refresh rate (so-and-so hertz), not frame rate (so-and-so fps). Could you explain this further for my understanding?"
SRSGaming,3do9d9,chainedwind,7,Sat Jul 18 13:48:47 2015 UTC,"The refresh rate is the number of frames your monitor displays. This was constant at 60Hz on LCD for many years, modern gaming LCDs can go up to 120Hz or 144Hz, on CRT monitors there wasn't a fixed refresh rate and it varied from brand to brand and on what resolution you wanted to run, but ~75-90Hz was common (the refresh rate was however still constant for the given video mode and didn't vary like it does with GSync/Freesync).  The framerate is the number of frames your computer provides to the monitor and varies from game to game.  If the framerate is higher then the refresh rate, then your monitor won't be able to display the full image the computer sends and you end up with a screen that contains half of the new image and half of the old one, that's called 'tearing'. If the framerate is lower then the refresh rate then the monitor will display the same image twice.  This means that framerate and refresh rate are closely linked together and in the ideal case you want to have a framerate that matches your monitors refresh rate exactly. Thus if somebody used a 120Hz CRT he did do so that he could display a game running at 120fps properly. Running a 120fps game on a 60Hz monitor would just give tearing and running a 60fps game on a 120Hz monitor instead of a 60Hz one would give no benefit other then some flicker reduction.  The whole idea behind GSync/Freesync is to fix this mess and sync up framerate and refresh rate once and for all. Your graphic card simply tells your monitor when to refresh instead of having the monitor running at a fixed refresh rate and then trying to have a game match that."

Yes genre does play a factor in 60 fps. Mainly in action games and platformers. 60 fps feels way more responsive than 30 and I prefer games to be at 60 even if I need to find a way to make it that way like in the original Soul Reaver. It becomes a way better game at 30 fps. I've known plenty of devs that have said something can't be done and suddenly someone comes out with a mod that fixes the problems the game has. So I feel that the argument that not all games can be 60 fps is a bit of bs.

SRSGaming,3do9d9,riomhaire,7,Mon Jul 20 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"There was a reason when I started this group that I decided to keep it purely objective. Initially, I went for a more aggressive approach and also inserted personal opinions into listings, but within minutes of starting this thing up I quickly realised that was a bad idea. Any sort of aggression or negativity would be amplified 10-fold by the internet and result in people crusading and witchhunting, so I made sure it was a purely objective list. No opinions, I even modified the tagline and mission statement to make sure people understood that this is a service for you guys and nothing more than that, it's designed to give you information.  However. Earlier today some people took it upon themselves to go after a developer who had removed our curator from their Steam page. Yes they can do that, for some reason people think they can't but there was an update last year in October that let you remove certain curators from your Store page. HOWEVER, those curators still show up if the user is following them, so for all of you, this literally makes no difference. The developer has since reinstated the curator, but I am absolutely not ok with people using this as an excuse to threaten, dogpile and witch-hunt developers. This is for your information only, it's not some kind of campaign to demand 60fps on all games, it's to help you make smart purchases. I don't endorse any behavior that involves threatening or harassing developers. If you want to criticise a games framerate, keep it civil, be calm and state your argument. Give adult, reasonable feedback.  Anyone I see involved in that behavior on the Steam forums will be banned from the group permanently. Don't do it. Don't change a positive project into some weapon for online indignation.   MFW"

Of course games like cs go i would not want 30 fps, since it's a first person shooter where reflexes and smoothnes matter a lot, but in the binding of Isaac i would honestly not care..  edit : I don't get why some devs do it though, seems kinda unneeded to lock games fps."
SRSGaming,3do9d9,2DE,14,Fri Jul 17 22:37:06 2015 UTC,"I don't get why some devs do it though, seems kinda unneeded to lock games fps.   Locked framerate usually gives a more stable/smoother experience than unlocked fps.  As for the reason behind it: AAA games are usually being developed for the consoles, then ported to the PC. It's easier, not as costly to develop for a fixed hardware, while the majority of sales also take place on the consoles. So it's really the case of cost-effectiveness, and apart from a few stinker PC ports, the framerate just isn't a top priority in every game.

SRSGaming,3do9d9,pengo,2,Sat Jul 18 10:03:43 2015 UTC,"Edit: Whoops, replied to the wrong person. Although that comment have been deleted since... I guess I'll leave it up, in case they come back, or for anyone who thinks that it's only about TotalBiscuit.     Sums up this whole post. Negativity because you don't like the person involved, even when there's nothing wrong with it.   Sure, it's easy to pick on TB, considering his past actions... but let's put him aside for a second, and judge the curator page by itself, in an ideal world, where harassment doesn't happen (for the sake of analysis, I don't mean to downplay the harm he did or what this ""FPS Police"" might cause).  Taking a cursory glance at the Steam Store, and how the Curators are being presented: we can safely say, that they get the most prominent display when it comes to feedback (that could potentially affect someone's potential buying decision). Because a) it's being place right under the price tage in contrast to the sidebar b) it gets to show the full recommendation[1] and a logo, whereas the user reviews take place under each games' description.  [1] only when the curator group has the most followers amongst the other recommendations in each game's storefront  Let's take a look at the how The Framerate Police's recommendation shows up on each game's storefront, and what it might say to a less seasoned gamer:   logo: it takes a very minimalistic approach - presenting its message without any ""noise"" - while putting a heavy emphasis on the 30. So by the design itself, it'll likely stand out amongst the other logos, which usually feature symbols or other non-figurative elements. However the most interesting thing is the choice of color, since the colors of red, and in our case, orange are being used for warnings, particularly on signs, in pair with black or grey. text: ""30 fps lock"" - while those who don't know/care about framerates could easily glance over the text itself, the word ""lock"" is usually associated with words carrying negative implications, like, closed, or restricted rather (when it comes IT). the name of the group: ""The Framerate Police"" - I probably don't have to talk about what sort of message does the word ""Police"" send. :)   While the curator on a game's storefront won't likely deter someone [from buying], its logo and choice of words sends the message ""warning"" by design.    When we get to the Curator Group itself, it still doesn't say it outloud, but its implications are undeniable when someone starts off with a message of ""To serve and protect"", or when we get to the FAQ: ""A: A great deal of people find 30fps gaming to be unpleasant""  Even if we ignore the gaming culture, it could discourage people from buying a game running at 30 fps, because the curator portraits themself as ""objective"", as someone who ""makes no judgements"". While gaming at 60 fps is undeniably better, many games, genres are being enjoyed or even designed with 30 frames per second in mind, thus for an even greater deal of people, the 30 fps warning simply isn't warrented.  So the issue stems from the wording, and the implications the whole curator thing carries. While on the other hand, it also simplifies the situation and ignores development realities (that aiming for 60 fps isn't always practical). The customer doesn't have to know about the latter, but this is where the state of gaming culture ties in, and the reason why it is expected from the curator to word its guidelines accordingly."
SRSGaming,3do9d9,pengo,6,Sat Jul 18 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, the tongue-in-cheek name is problematic as well as the resulting morons who harass card game developers for having a 30 fps lock (or harass any other devs too). I notice he's added genre to the description, presumably to reduce the second problem.   As for whether it discourages people from buying a game running at 30 fps, well, they can make up their own mind. That's the point. There's an open discussion on each 30 fps ""review"" where anyone can weigh in on the meaningfulness for the particular game. It wouldn't make sense for TB to the arbiter.  But my point is that you continue to search for any possible problem with the system because it's TB that made it. If TB got food companies to include how much added sugar is in a product, you'd be finding fault in that too."
SRSGaming,3do9d9,Dedalus-,0,Sun Jul 19 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"My point is that you continue to search for any possible problem with the system because it's TB that made it.   I can see why my snarky OP may give you that impression, but even if that's the case, would you find it questionable when people point out issues with a publication or company that has a huge influence? In the comment you replied to, I was trying to explain the in and outs of the curator system in greater detail and the possible effects the 30 FPS curator migh have. It had nothing to do with TB.  Some people will care about TB's opinions, while others don't, but you can't deny the fact that his inlfuence is something to be ignored. The same way that gamer culture is inseperable from the industry. Just because TotalBiscuit represents himself, that doesn't make him immune to criticism. The fact that he happens to receive more has only got to with his actions, but since his influence shapes gamer culture, his actions will always be viewed under a magnifying glass. Even more so for demonstrating careless behaviour in the past, which attracted a small, but very vocal minority whom are notorious for shaping the industry in a destructive way.  The addition of the genre is a great move, and he deserves some credit for addressing the harassment in a timely fashion, but he'll be criticised for the smallest thing, not because he's a guy in a top hat, but for having 2+ million subscribers."
SRSGaming,3do9d9,Dedalus-,6,Sun Jul 19 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"Fair points. I absolutely agree he is not immune from criticism. However, in this sub people go out of their way to make it. I mean who really spends time pointing out how boring something is and how much it doesn't interest them?   No one else here would even dare even give constructive feedback, because ""TB is toxic and everything he does is toxic"". That is a toxic attitude. And it's exactly what makes KIA toxic. Such as the example I linked to above where KIA criticise Twine stories they haven't read for having a ""pretentious"" list of authors, whatever that means.  Everyone is so fucking reactionary. No one bothers to think. Sorry this is largely not directed at you. Thanks for having a reasonable conversation."

Yes, it's hard and cumbersome admitting that there is problematic stuff everywhere(/being an adult) but admitting that they are is the least you can do.

How hard would it be to say: „O wow, I didn't realize that this is fucked up.
