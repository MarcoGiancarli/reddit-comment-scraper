I constantly had problems where the car wouldn't be getting spark, or bad compression, or something would get messed up with the alignment because of failing parts. Basically they are old cars. I didn't have the money to shovel out for the higher condition ones, so I would end up with a lower end one, and within a few months they'd have problem after problem appear and nickel and dime me to a point where I'd just dump it off on someone else because I couldn't afford to keep it on the road.

AwesomeCarMods,3brb56,JonasBrosSuck,3,Wed Jul 1 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of trolling is a art :      ""Trolling is a art"" is perhaps the definitive statement regarding trolling. If we define trolling as the intentional disruption of another's emotional well being, often through a feigned promotion of an unpopular belief, or political position, the statement is in itself a troll. The deliberate use of ""a"" where ""an"" should be is likely to arouse a negative reaction among those concerned with correct english usage. The fact that the statement is itself directly referring to trolling and the art thereof gives further power to its effect; if you're jimmies are rustled by this statement, its author has succeeded, and its veracity has been confirmed.     jimbob: you're balls are lo thus as a small mammal.  fred:You fucking faggot, you meant ""your.""  jimbob: Trolling is a art.  fred: I think you meant ""an.""

A sanding disk on an angle grinder and some patience will let you transform letter tires into whitewalls. Messy as heck to do it though, wear a mask.   Not sure why downvoted, it's true, and a common hotrod on a budget practice to grind your own whitewalls. The white rubber strip is down under a layer of black on goodyear eagles and other such raised white letter tires. That process never changed, they just fell out of fashion so they put white letter on by masking off the rest with a thin black layer. It's why you see people who can't park on a curb well with crappy scrubbed whitewalls on one side of their truck."

As a fan of older vehicles I don't think they look nearly as similar as people suggest. It's like if people said the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic look the same."
AwesomeCarMods,3bmh3e,CptBackfire,2,Tue Jun 30 17:41:54 2015 UTC,Very true. They look different with the exception of Nesbitt's design cues.

AwesomeCarMods,3bd24g,seventysevensevens7,4,Sun Jun 28 04:04:45 2015 UTC,The owner said he bought from some guy that was on the stennis and that he had some tie to the tail number (maybe he worked on that one). He said the previous owners father named it the Death Star. Idk what relation to the navy the Death Star name had but that's what he said.

AwesomeCarMods,3bd24g,spongewardk,5,Sun Jun 28 12:31:26 2015 UTC,Is it the Death Star or a Naval aircraft carrier?!  I AM SO FUCKING CONFUSED RIGHT NOW!
AwesomeCarMods,3bd24g,BaboonRockFighter,4,Sun Jun 28 15:23:46 2015 UTC,why not both? A Naval carrier that is eventually retrofitted to a part of a death star. They just take all these defunct ships and glue them together to make a death star in space.

AwesomeCarMods,3b9na8,PCDevine,21,Sat Jun 27 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yes the are as you can see in this image of another beetle pickup conversion. Most pickup conversions put a shelf across the top of the bed like this to give you a bit more of a conventional space. In my experience, most shelves or liners are able to lift up granting access both to the engine and to the bed area that used to be the backseat of the beetle which you can kind of see here below the rear window. Pickup conversions are usually pretty simple, but a few are downright gorgeous"

AwesomeCarMods,3b9na8,adrian959,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"Question, what would stop you from converting it to a front engine car. (besides a ton of time and money)"
AwesomeCarMods,3b9na8,Jumbojet777,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"That's what most V8 swaps do, however it requires building a custom frame to mount the body onto, building a new front end suspension, steering control, relocating the gas tank, etc. Alternatively other V8 swaps leave the engine in the back which requires only a minor (compartively) amount of modification to the beetle's body, though in both instances a roll cage for stability is necessary.  There's nothing really stopping you from doing any of that, but then you start to lose the appeal of the Beetle in that it's a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive car with a classic early twentieth century look. If you want performance out of it, you can turn the stock 1.6L into a 2.5L fairly easily and get around 250HP, or you can swap in a Porche 944 or a Subaru engine and both fit (sort of) into the rear engine bay. And don't forget, all this horsepower in a car that's lighter than a Mazda MX-5.  That said, I'm of the opinion that the Beetle is best when it expresses the tastes and opinions of its owner. It's such a versatile and flexible little car that has been modified countless ways. Want a V12 Buggy? Go for it! Want a stock 1.2L 1954 that's been carefully restored? Sounds awesome! Want to put a 6.3L V8 with a blower the size of Texas into the front with 15"" wide tires in back? Sign me up."
AwesomeCarMods,3b9na8,wyrdsmith,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:35:17 2015 UTC,"So a ton of time and money. Still, I'd love to see a little beetle pull up to a stop light, honk its horn and then blaze away in a cloud of V8 powered tire smoke."

And it's not like he's in west Texas where he would encounter any sort of off-road terrain that would require them. He'd be better off with a set of large tire slicks or a pair of Mickey Thompsons"
AwesomeCarMods,3aekyw,CoffeeJedi,12,Fri Jun 19 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"In the movie, the vehicle was designed to work in tandem with another to jump across a river and pull a flexible bridge across. It would have needed those tires in that kind of terrain."

AwesomeCarMods,3aekyw,boundone,3,Sun Jun 21 07:26:40 2015 UTC,"If you've got one slick and one knobby with the same diameter(the slick being the diameter of the knobs), then that is more contact patch than two knobbies.  Better on pavement, but still has knobby for occasional offroad traction."
AwesomeCarMods,3aekyw,Vroonkle,3,Sun Jun 21 07:29:45 2015 UTC,"It had Super Swamper TSLs in the back for the movie, and they were being run in a dually configuration. Although the contact patch was affected by the large lugs, the sidewall ratio is more of a problem for a high horsepower vehicle than anything; too much flex in your sidewall can cause you to tear your tread off. If you want to base an argument in reality for swapping the tires out for something more streetable: There are not many street tires available in sizes like that. It was probably just not an option to find a nice 44"" pavement tire."
AwesomeCarMods,3aekyw,Guy_with_big_truck,-5,Sat Jun 20 17:40:40 2015 UTC,most likely for the aesthetic look. Less on on the function.  He may as well have blinged it up with chrome. (and people will throw eggs)

I need to finish my prototype (if you haven't seen my previous video check it out on my YouTube channel) - then I can factor a bill of materials and go for there.   No I'm not too concerned about security:   I wrote a challenge response library to query the connection.  if a response is not confirmed within a time frame the connection attempt is severed.  each 'command' also uses a second separate challenge response.  the key can not be used until another security feature has been passed. In the case of (some) Saab vehicles (in my case) the lock could potentially be turned using your thumb as long as the transponder check is passed. The remote start combats this by blocking the solenoid when remote start is active..: in other-words the key can be used normally, as normal. If remote start is active however, the ignition can not be turned unless you first pass a security feature. A finger print scanner for example or a passcode keypad.  if someone managed to get into the vehicle whilst the remote start is active (let's say they smash a window), if the brake is pressed, handbrake released or the revs exceeded 1250 (idle is around 1000-1100) the remote start cuts off.

AwesomeCarMods,38wkdo,Ghuurka,2,Sun Jun 7 21:35:42 2015 UTC,Haha yeah - some ppl on Facebook were eager to see remote start added so I undertook that challenge and added it. Thought I'd post the vid to show it was possible. Still a fair whack left to do but I'm getting there :)

AwesomeCarMods,38asai,jayond,10,Wed Jun 3 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no.  Tracks are very slow both in terms of the gearing and power needed to turn them and the fact they self destruct from heat at any kind of speed. Products like Mat Trax are limited to 35 mph on pavement. Secondly, DOT certification is an expensive boondoggle and tracks typically come from cottage industry manufactures (except Comoplast). Third, the rubber isn't in contact with the ground on this style of track, the steel ""grauzer"" is; it'd be like running less forgiving snow chains on assault.  /r/snowcats"

In addition to increasing the octane (i.e., preventing early detonation), methanol/water would also cool the air significantly, pre-blower and post-turbo.  EDIT: It's a 200hp shot of nitrous setup. It would do the same as the above, but only temporarily, as nitrous is not a constantly running system."
AwesomeCarMods,37bco2,SicilSlovak,28,Tue May 26 15:07:00 2015 UTC,"but only temporarily, as nitrous is not a constantly running system.   If you're a pussy."
AwesomeCarMods,37bco2,mck1117,32,Tue May 26 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"Haha! True, or just lack the space for a massive bottle.  A 100hp shot of nitrous uses 0.8lbs of nitrous oxide (which, for simplicity's sake, I'll refer to simply as ""nitrous"" from here on out) for every 10 seconds of usage, according to Nitrous Express. Let's assume a 200hp shot, like the kind on this Camaro, will use double that, 1.6lbs for every 10 seconds of usage (it's likely closer to 2lbs, but let's use the lower number just to see what the lower end of the minimum volume required for a constantly running nitrous system would be).  The standard 10lbs bottle of nitrous used in automotive applications is 21in long, by 7in wide. Volume-wise that's about 808.17in3 (0.467691ft3 ), the calculation for volume is V=(pi)r2 *h in case you'd like to check the math.  That 10lbs of nitrous, pushing a 200hp shot, would last you a little over a minute at 62.5 seconds. Not very fun (or, more accurately, very fun, but then very sad shortly after). So, how big of a tank of nitrous would you need to run that 200hp shot on a quick run to and from the grocery store let's say 5min each way?  If 10lbs provides 62.5sec of 200hp boost, utilizing 0.467691ft3 of space, and we need enough to last us 5min (300sec), each way (600sec round trip), then we would need a 96lbs bottle of nitrous, utilizing 4.48983ft3 of space. To put this into perspective, the total cargo capacity of a 1969 Camaro is 8.5ft3. Leaving us about 4ft3 of space, that's livable.  But who wants to fill up the giggle juice every time you take a short jaunt to pick up some eggs and milk for Nana’s famous coffee cake? Let’s go for something a bit more reasonable. How about every time we fill up on gas, we also top off the nitrous?  Now, I don’t know what the fuel efficiency is on this particular Camaro, other than “not good,” so let’s give it the gargantuan benefit of the doubt, and pretend it’s that of a stock 1969 Camaro Z28, with a fuel efficiency rating topping out at of 14.5mpg at highway speeds. With a fuel capacity of 18 gallons, that means we’d be able to cover 261 miles before running dry. Knowing that the EPA calculates highway fuel efficiency while driving at an average speed of 48.3 mph, it would take about 5.4037hrs in order to watch the needle drop from full to empty.  So what kind of nitrous bottle would we need to make that trip running a constant 200hp shot? If a 62.5sec shot requires 10lbs of nitrous, then 5.4037hrs (19,453.416sec) will require a 3,112.54658lbs bottle, utilizing 145.571ft3 of space, which is about equivalent to four extra large double door home refrigerators. Not sure how you’re going to mount that, but hey, there it is.  Then there’s the issue of cost, but that’s a discussion for another time."

AwesomeCarMods,37bco2,Cthulu2013,1 point,Tue May 26 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"The whole assumption is for nitrous levels used at wide open throttle though. If you actually had a car that was set up to use nitrous oxide in proportion with the air flow through the engine (so say you got 30% more power at all throttle openings) it may be possible for short trips. To calculate it out you would need to figure out the flow of air used during whatever type of driving and then the amount of nitrous that would be added to increase power. Of course adding power would need less airflow too.  The reason nitrous is only used at WOT is because most of the time it would be the only time the additional power is needed, but it would be pretty cool to set up a system that gave a proportional boost with throttle, like the air the car was getting had a constant stream of nitrous oxide in it."
AwesomeCarMods,37bco2,devilpants,1 point,Wed May 27 06:02:16 2015 UTC,"If 100 hp uses .8lbs per 10 seconds that would be about 125 seconds of n2o.  If 200 hp is double that the time would be half so 1.6lbs per 10 sec would equal about 62 seconds. A ten minute trip would need about 100 pounds of n2o, or 10 10 lbs bottles.  Now I am no mathmagician so I could very well be wrong but, I believe you forgot to multiply 6.25 by ten for the amount of seconds it last."

Chroming the teeth is symbolic of that sacrifice for the collective and the promise of the rewards to come.  It's all tied up with the gear head militant Norse mythology infused brainwashing by which his War Boys live.  At least that's my take on it, and I will freely admit I'm not an expert in Mad Maxian lore.

AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,_IAmOrion_,12,Mon May 25 17:08:34 2015 UTC,This is seriously amazing
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,IZAW_SK1LL,4,Mon May 25 17:14:06 2015 UTC,Thanks :) more to come hopefully as I update and improve
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,IZAW_SK1LL,3,Mon May 25 17:33:19 2015 UTC,I'm geeking over this more than I should and I kind of want to know how it works because now i want to do it to my car
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,agarcia820,4,Mon May 25 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"My Saab uses Pulse Width Modulation instead of simple mechanical switches (although at least the horn I could use a simple relay and piggy back the relay in the engine bay).   Arduino + Red Bear BLE, modded BLE library, my own beta challenge / response code (which needs much more work yet) for security, and objective-c skills for the app  In terms of security, believe it or not the challenge response was ironically the trickiest. BLE doesn't ""pair"" as such, so it is always advertising ready for a connection.  To over come this I modded the BLE library to require authentication on connection.  If a device connects and does not authenticate instantly upon connection, the connection is killed.  My iPhone / Apple Watch app of course waits for the authentication request and responds and allows the connection :)  I could increase further and use the EEPROM to store connection attempts and block any further attempts from a device that failed however with a limited lifecycle (well, like 100,000 writes) I didn't want to go that far for the prototype."
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,IZAW_SK1LL,5,Mon May 25 17:41:28 2015 UTC,In simpler terms how can this be done?
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,IZAW_SK1LL,3,Mon May 25 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on your vehicle. If it uses mechanical switches then it's easier than what I had to undertake. When I say mechanical, I mean a simple ""push to make"" or ""push to break"" switch - as those can be turned on and off via a 5v relay board connected to an Arduino.   I used an Arduino Uno for the project, and a ""4 relay"" board for the horn with relays spare for future updates etc.   Also check out RedBear BLE shield or Adafruits BLE breakout board for the connectivity. They both provide arduino libraries and iOS/android example code for their respective boards."
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,IZAW_SK1LL,3,Mon May 25 18:13:46 2015 UTC,So as someone with little to no knowledge on this and drives a 04 mustang i think I wont be able to pull this off.
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,jdb12,3,Mon May 25 17:53:54 2015 UTC,Depends on your eagerness to explorer no learn ;). If you're willing to pull switches out / off and tap into wiring (assuming it's mechanical) then it's not as hard as it sounds.   Always worth getting hold of workshop manuals as they often can tell you ahead of time if a part is mechanical or uses PWM to a computer for switches etc.   In my case I got hold of what is called SAAB WIS.
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,jdb12,2,Mon May 25 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"When i get at least semi interested in something and im geeking over this, I find it easy to learn something. I have a raspberry pi b + laying around and also an off brand android smartwatch so I might take a crack at this"
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,jdb12,1 point,Mon May 25 18:24:19 2015 UTC,I'd not recommend the RaspPI due the complications of a BLE connection and controlling the GPIO pins.   You can pick up an Arduino Uno for like £5 on eBay.   Plus the arduino website and downloadable IDE has plenty of basic examples to get you started
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,jdb12,2,Mon May 25 18:58:16 2015 UTC,Oh ok thanks for everything man really appreciate it. Wish the best on your project and can't wait for the future updates.
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,DrCoquenbols,2,Mon May 25 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) just FYI I tried first with my Pi B+ and BLE dongle but the arduino was such easier plus zero ""boot time"" of an OS and the power draw from an Arduino is like 55mAh (I measured mine running) so my car would run for 2 weeks plus before it could drain the battery - which it wouldn't anyways as the car is obv being"
AwesomeCarMods,3780q6,DrCoquenbols,3,Mon May 25 19:23:18 2015 UTC,A WIP app and sketch made by me. I borrowed some icons used whilst I get a designer friend of mine to make me some (if anyone wants to pitch in some royalty free icons / graphics pls feel free)  Uses BLE. Also uses a basic challenge / response to ensure security.

Now the P1800's are all really good looking (though the ES might be an acquired taste).  Now this Corvolvo on the other hand... well, let's just say none of the lines work together particularly well.  Taking the hard edged 80's styling C4 and cross breeding it with a soft curves of the late 50's early 60's Volvo aren't something I find appealing.  But looks are subjective."

The Grand Prix V6 is whoahfully shy of sporty, but for a commuter its not sluggish.  The idea of a G8/Aztec mix is really cool.. I don't know if it would be production worthy, if that were possible, but hey it falls right into the category of the BMW X6 sportSUwagon.
