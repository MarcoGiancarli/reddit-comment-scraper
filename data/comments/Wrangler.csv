Wrangler,3e4imf,MartyBass,2,Wed Jul 22 00:10:31 2015 UTC,"My guess is all the aftermarket parts on it. Some of which look irreversible.

Wrangler,3e3rvr,Corgana,3,Tue Jul 21 21:08:45 2015 UTC,I really don't know why they seem to have fallen out of favor so much. Maybe because more wheelbase allows more tire before stretching becomes necessary?
Wrangler,3e3rvr,TeamJim,4,Tue Jul 21 21:26:03 2015 UTC,I don't get it either- I bought a Wrangler because of it's compact size.

Wrangler,3e23qk,TeamJim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"uhh, when they were gutted, those parts went somewhere.  I'm suggesting OP be the place one of the front seats goes.  It's not like it's a heart transplant that needs to be available at an exact moment."
Wrangler,3e23qk,PigSlam,0,Tue Jul 21 16:37:33 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying if he ""goes to a junkyard"" like you said, the odds of finding anything worth his time are very slim."
Wrangler,3e23qk,TeamJim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"If he goes to one junk yard, looks out back, doesn't see what he wants, and that's the entirety of his search, then sure. If he's brave enough to talk to a human, then they can often find the part, and either tell you where to get it, or have it shipped to them.  Or he could go to a Jeep dealership and order a new one.  Which one do you think will cost more?  His question specifically was ""Where can I find one that won't cost me a huge chunk?""  Do you have a better suggestion?"
Wrangler,3e23qk,PigSlam,0,Tue Jul 21 16:53:45 2015 UTC,"Wrangler forum, jeep forum, any local forum, craigslist, ebay"
Wrangler,3e23qk,TeamJim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, some of those could work. Anything requiring some guy to ship a seat from his house to yours would probably put it over the ""huge chunk"" range though.  I did a quick craigslist search in Denver (where I happen to be, and where Jeeps seem to grow from trees) and the only JK seats I could find was a $400 pair of fronts from a 2013 Sahara.  That also seems like a huge chunk to me."

Wrangler,3dxyqk,Apatinop,15,Mon Jul 20 13:23:52 2015 UTC,Couple grand more and you can get a new one with the substantially better 3.6.
Wrangler,3dxyqk,Genericsoda4,3,Mon Jul 20 13:35:44 2015 UTC,Why is the 3.6 better than a 3.8?
Wrangler,3dxyqk,Genericsoda4,8,Mon Jul 20 13:41:10 2015 UTC,"More power, better on gas. That 3.8 feels even slower than the numbers say, and with bigger tires and a lift, I would be scared of every on-ramp."
Wrangler,3dxyqk,PigSlam,2,Mon Jul 20 13:42:41 2015 UTC,I'll take this into account when I test drive it today. Thanks for the info.
Wrangler,3dxyqk,RogerShakenbak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this, I was in my ~stock 2013 JKUR following a friend in his 2007 JK X, with a mild lift, and 33"" tires, and a Gobi roof rack up a decent hill outside of Boulder CO (up the canyon from Boulder to Nederland if anyone knows the road).  We were behind some jerk in a Toyota crossover of some kind, and he was driving about 10mph below the speed limit in the single lane, and then accelerating to 10-20mph over the limit where there were passing lanes.  My friend was in front, and though I could hear through his aftermarket exhaust that he was giving it all he had, I was constantly catching up and needing to back off on the gas to avoid rear-ending him.  So even though I was in a 20"" longer Jeep, with another occupant, my dogs, a bunch of other gear, it was amazing how much faster my 3.6L rig was compared to his 3.8 in similar circumstances.  If you can get the 3.6L engine, you probably should.  The 3.8L engine is pretty much the most common complaint I hear about the JK."
Wrangler,3dxyqk,Grandmastrgusto,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I have only one regret with my 2010. It is a dog. Just soooo down on power. I could use a regear, but even with one, the 3.8L is a sick puppy. Thought of putting a supercharger on it but by the time you spend that money you could spend a little more for a Hemi swap. Then you also start running into warranty issues (have an extended one on mine). It's my only complaint."
Wrangler,3dxyqk,Hedsic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:18 2015 UTC,"I traded my 13 Rubi with 26k on it last week for a 15jkur. My 13 is on their lot for $31,900. At least step up to a 12+...better engine, better interior."
Wrangler,3dxyqk,DozinTheRubicon,5,Wed Jul 22 00:59:39 2015 UTC,Wow! For that price you can buy one brand new... Plus remember the rule. Be cautious buying an already modified Jeep. Who knows what the last owner put it through or if they even modified it correctly. I would spend the same amount and buy a brand new one with the better engine and a start of a full warranty.
Wrangler,3dxyqk,MountJEEP,3,Mon Jul 20 15:07:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. It seems like buying a new one would be my best choice.

Wrangler,3dxyqk,handsolo85,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"Apart from the laughably high price I'd personally never buy a modded car because you don't know exactly what they bought and who/how it was installed (I know they give you a list but assume dealerships are liars.) Could have been all installed in their garage drunk. Also it's probably been wheeled in and who know what's happened out on the trails that would never happen to a steer car.   Get a stock Rubicon (new or 2012+ for newer engine) and use it, then decide what/if you need mods."
Wrangler,3dxyqk,CaliKido,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:14 2015 UTC,My parents are purchasing it for everyone to drive and they don't plan on getting any mods at all if they get a new one. I checked this one out today couldn't find any damage. It felt great on the interstate considering how heavy it is. If we bought new we would get a 2-door willys with a soft top. Staying stock seems so boring.
Wrangler,3dxyqk,CaliKido,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:29 2015 UTC,Gotcha well the 4 door would be more fun then. See if you can wait a little longer to find a modded 2012 4 door the engine is really worth getting if you can.

Wrangler,3dxyqk,snuckinbackdoor,2,Wed Jul 22 01:04:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other posters. If you're looking for a Jeep that is 5 years old or less, it's better to buy new. The depreciation is very low on Wranglers.  Also, OP, remember that it's very easy to negotiate a good deal on a new Wrangler. 1% below invoice should be your starting price of negotiations. I factory ordered mine back in May of last year and that is what I paid. It's not an exact number, but invoice price is basically 9% off MSRP. So take the MSRP of the Jeep you want times .91, and that's the starting negotiations price.  Good luck!"

It'll take 4 to 8 weeks for them to build it and get it to you.   Take the money you have left and go buy a trailer hitch, the wiring harness, and a new set of rims. Watch Ebay and Craigslist for rims/tires - you can find sets of Rubicon rims+tires or other rims+tires for $1,000 and up for all 5, depending on what exactly you're looking for.  Call your insurance agency and they will tell you exactly what insurance will cost."
Wrangler,3dydoo,superwormy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:03 2015 UTC,Keep in mind if you go basest of base you're talking manual transmission and also giving up premium soft top/ freedom top (both nice). Not to mention 3.21 gears which will make the whole lift/tire thing suck. Max tow package comes with 3.73 gearing.

Wrangler,3dydoo,Creativeusername833,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly , if I could find something I really liked, used, I'd rather save some money and do what you did. Problem is, all the ones I've seen around that year have crazy high miles (150k and up)and generally don't have what I'm looking for in a vehicle. The ones I do like are more in the 25k range (still high miles), used, and what I'm buying new will honestly be around 32k. 35k is just a sort of limit, so to speak.   The extra 8 or 9 grand seems worth it to me. Having a brand new car, exactly how I want it and no worries of how the vehicle was treated by various owners over the past 7~8 years. Also don't have to worry about improper mods being done by them either. Plus the manufacturers warranty and such as well."

Wrangler,3dymwe,Valkyrie4x4,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:11:32 2015 UTC,I agree - that price is high. The dealer seems to think that the vehicle is a big find since because of the mods and low milage.
