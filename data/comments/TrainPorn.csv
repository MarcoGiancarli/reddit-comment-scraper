TrainPorn,3d1kyd,TheFue,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:45:22 2015 UTC,"Always a class act, NS.  At one time, Altoona Works Engine 8, a 1923 Ahrens Fox N-S-4, was always in attendance at this event, as it was owned by a local collector named David Buskey, who purchased it from its second owner in 1975 and kept it at the Harrisburg Fire Museum (now PA National Fire Museum) in former Reily Hose Company No 10 on 4th Street. Since Mr. Buskey's passing, Engine 8 has moved out west and is sort of a Reading 2100 of RR Fire Departments.  For those unaware, like some other railroads (B&O, ATSF, UP to name 3 I know of), the PRR once maintained its own fire department for the Altoona Works complex. To my knowledge, only Engines 7 (1948 Mack L-85, retained and cared for by the City of Altoona) and 8 survive along with the buildings that housed them. 8 served from delivery til 1965, then 1965-1975 in nearby East Freedom. When Mr. Buskey acquired it, the rig was still on its original, as-delivered 1923 hard rubber tires.  Engine 8 served out of a house along present-day Chestnut Ave in Altoona, now owned by Home Nursing. Station 7 is now Altoona Pipe and Steel's offices behind the Master Mechanic's building (Altoona Railroader's Memorial Museum).  A bonus bit of history: In the early days of horse and hand drawn apparatus, it was somewhat common for a company requiring additional equipment and manpower to fight a fire to call in the neighboring towns. Harrisburg's companies often were sent miles outside the city to fight fires in Daulphin County, and no hand drawn hose cart was getting there in a timely fashion. The area railroads (Cumberland Valley, Reading, and PRR mainly) would load the company on a couple flat cars and run a special wherever they needed to go, no charge (because guess who they'd be calling when their stuff caught fire).  The railroad industry and firefighters have a very long history together.  EDIT: IF I can dredge up a photo of Engine 8, I'll scan it and share. Apparently 7, 8, and 9 all ran on the City's call boxes at one point."

The S1 was the result of designs submitted to the PRR by Baldwin, Lima, and ALCo--the Baldwin design winning out (favorititsm, possibly--they were longtime partners)  At 140 feet 2 1/2 inches long, the locomotive  was so large, it had to take a rather circuitous route to reach New York City from Altoona, PA--its long, rigid wheelbase prevented it from operating over most of the PRR system.  After the exhibition, it was re-lettered in the same PRR scheme used for the later 4-4-4-4 T1 duplexes. The locomotive was pressed into service on the Fort Wayne Division (or 'racetrack' as it was called for the speeds found there). The length of the locomotive required the construction of a wye at Crestline, OH (it wouldn't fit on the turntable), and turning the locomotive at Chicago used the connection with CB&Q (Burlington).   The design itself was never replicated. It was, however, sucessful enough, that the PRR again solicited designs for production from the big three (Baldwin, Lima, and ALCo). The result was the 4-4-4-4 T1. (52 total, split nearly 50/50 between Altoona and Baldwin, and if things go well, the 53rd may yet see life...needs about $10M first though).  Of note, Lima's entry had an interesting variation: The front engine used 80 inch drivers, while the rear used 76 inch drivers. The result would have been that the engines would have always been at different RPM, preventing phasing from ever occurring as well as allowing larger boiler courses near the firebox.  This 1967 article in Trains has a small section specifially about the design evolution of both the S1 and T1.  The S1 remains the only 6-4-4-6 ever built, and also the largest and heaviest rigid-frame design. It was put out of service in 1945 and cut up in 1949. The T1 it spawned survived in service until 1952, all of which were likewise cut up, though #5550's T1 Trust is currently looking to have driver centers cast this year."
TrainPorn,3byfjm,Lamhirh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:57:31 2015 UTC,So no train of this type survived?
TrainPorn,3byfjm,spudzilla,3,Fri Jul 3 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"No duplexes of any kind survived. They were the tweeners of the steam age. Cool, but young enough that they weren't beloved by the public."
TrainPorn,3byfjm,MattAdams53,2,Fri Jul 3 16:15:12 2015 UTC,"No. For all its preservation measures by saving one example of several successful locomotive classes, the PRR didn't save any of its later designs. The S1 (1 prototype, #6100), T1 (2 prototypes and 50 production), and Q2 (26 total) duplexes, along with the S2 6-8-6 steam turbine (1 prototype, only 6-8-6 ever built) were all scrapped by the end of steam on the PRR. They even scrapped the conventional 2-10-4 J1 (125 locomotives, carbon-copies of the C&O T-1).  The only hope for the duplex design, specifically the T1, is the new-build project inspired by the LNER A1 Peppercorn Tornado, hence my comment of needing about $10M, as that's the rough estimate the group has settled on for completing the project.  It's worth noting that, for those too lazy to check the wiki article, the S1 and T1 were both capable of speeds in excess of 100 mph, with anecdotal evidence of exceeding 130+. When #5550 is finished, you can bet Mallard is going to get a run for its record.  In the end, only ~19 steam locomotives from one of the Northeastern US's biggest roads survive, out of fleet numbering thousands (6,642 total built in Altoona alone between 1840 and 1946, the last being T1 #5524). ~13 are in the hands of the PA Historical and Museum Commission, the other 6 escaped thru various means and are the only candidates for operational restoration due to the H&MC's policies. The six (Long Island G5s 4-6-0 #35 & #39, PRR K4s 4-6-2 #1361, B4a 0-6-0 #643, I1sa 2-10-0 #4483, and B6sa 0-6-0 #60) are scattered between PA, DE, and NY. Three of those are being worked on in some capacity, and all of them--or their owners-- need large injections of money for one purpose or another (be it for the locomotive itself, or to keep the lights on in general), and #643 is actually operable, albeit carrying an HK Porter boiler that replaced its Altoona Machine Shops original in the 1940s. #4483 is outdoors but well-cared for, with possible operation much later on (its owners have discussed the possibility at a few points), and #60 is orphaned in Delaware needing much TLC."

TrainPorn,3byfjm,Chizzoink,5,Fri Jul 3 06:06:41 2015 UTC,"They're different engines - this is the PRR S1, designed for and built by PRR's Altoona Works. The N&W was not without representation, as class A #1206 was in attendance."

Personally, I'll never fully understand the debate that N&W built the best out there, when there were plenty of other possible contenders. What qualifies as ""best"" is subjective-- Best speed? Best tractive effort? Best fuel economy? Best looking? Best drawbar horsepower? Best utilization? Most photogenic (please don't kill me, OWL fans)? The A class were multi-purpose machines, but had a top speed of 70 mph, so under my subjective (and admittedly biased) views, they lose out.   Fwiw the main problems with the S1 were its size (hence the more compact T1). The main problem with the duplexes in general was tied to wheel slip at speed, which was primarily caused by suspension equalization--the front engine would lift from the rails in a curve. Once the suspension was split, the problem resolved."

There was plenty of logical opportunity for nationalization at that point in time.  Either the economic crisis of the 1930s or the need to efficiently handle wartime needs of the 1940s would have been excellent excuses to pull a British Rail.  There's a lot of interesting discussion that could extend from there.  Would they standardize on modern steam, or just skip straight to dieselization after the war?  Would putting the government into the rail business have given them a reason to hobble the nascent air-travel sector?

TrainPorn,3bqbcg,BigBassBone,3,Wed Jul 1 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"Condensers were used on some conventional locomotives that operated in desert environments with minimal infrastructure, such as South Africa, Chile, and the Sudan.  They were also used on many turbine-powered locomotives because turbine efficiency increased greatly when a condenser is used to increase pressure drop across the turbine.  This one though....  Condensers on a locomotive are usually pretty easy to spot.  They're big and require a lot of airflow.  a bunch of louvered vents is usually a good indication.    The tight streamlining and smallish tender would seem to preclude that here."

They all have way more than adequate brakes to run at full speed. Not only do they have enough brakes to run at full speed, but I would venture to say that a single locomotive at full speed can be brought to a complete stop(not factoring in grades) within a quarter of a mile from the moment the engineer shoves it into full dynos.

There was talk that Michigan wanted to buy them, but I haven't seen anything more recent than a year ago on that... or maybe you're right and they're tied up until the court case is concluded (and it sure looks like Talgo is going to get its money from Wisconsin)."
TrainPorn,3asnlj,ringmod76,2,Tue Jun 23 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that one of the problems is that Talgo would want to maintain them at a Talgo facility, of which the only one is in Seattle.

Back East, you'd almost never see this because it rains much more often. Back in the day when steam was common, so much cinders were flying that the grass really didn't have a chance to grow.

TrainPorn,3aktkv,kellyzdude,2,Sun Jun 21 19:38:46 2015 UTC,"There are more than a few of those around. I remember old Norton Road in Hamilton, New Zealand -- it was south of the Te Rapa yard so not much of a problem overall, but still 6-7 tracks on a main road crossing. They did a big excavation a few years back, now the road goes under the tracks.  You don't even need a lot of tracks to get legal problems. Here in Virginia, there's an ""inland port"" off Norfolk Southern's mainline. There's a main line, an extra long passing siding (usually good for two trains) and a wye which comes off to enter the port. There's also a neighborhood off to the east, and I'm fairly certain that the only entrances to it are a road to the north and a road to the south which are often both blocked while trains deliver and pick up their cuts of cars from the port. Reasonably sized signs on both roads which state ""if crossing blocked for more than ten minutes, call  police at ..."""

Recently a developer has invested money in redeveloping the shops area into an apartment complex or something.

TrainPorn,37olan,Meersbrook,3,Fri May 29 20:06:07 2015 UTC,That's a regular diamond me thinks.. (screenshot)  Flange bearing diamonds (OWLS) have the higher used line  continous so that trains can run full speed on it and the lesser side is low speed and goes over the mainline. Less maintainence needed than a traditional diamond since you dont have wheels slamming down on the gaps in the old style diamonds.   In this case the low use line will be the one from California State Railroad Museum who uses moves aorund their own equipment and I think still have a customer on their lines.

TrainPorn,37liou,rebo2,1 point,Fri May 29 07:04:18 2015 UTC,"NS is headquartered EDIT: has a large office in Atlanta; also, prior to being here, it was at the Kentucky Derby (they send it every year), but I don't know why it was in Atlanta for those three or so days.   I also can't figure out where the other cars were while it was parked in Atlanta, but they were removed somewhere between Rockmart and Peachtree Station, and then were re-attached somewhere on the trip back to Altoona, where the OCS is stored.  I actually first noticed it on my way into work one morning (I think it's the second time I've seen it here, maybe the third), but the pictures in the original post were taken mid-day - I had some business in Midtown and I made a point of swinging by to get pictures on my way back to the office. Sadly, I didn't have my good camera with me, and it was gone the next day (it left that evening - here it is getting ready to depart while the 20 Crescent arrives, late as usual)."
TrainPorn,37liou,Lamhirh,1 point,Fri May 29 14:12:31 2015 UTC,"It's slightly odd that, despite HQ being in Atlanta Norfolk, the OCS is a very regular sight around the Juniata Shops (Altoona). Apparently Altoona is the OCS's home base--it is most certainly serviced here, that much I'm sure of--but it doesn't make too much sense to constantly be running a 1000 mile deadhead...  Dumbass me, it's Norfolk Southern, not Atlanta Northern..."
TrainPorn,37liou,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 31 12:24:50 2015 UTC,"Altoona is indeed where OCS is based/stored - not entirely sure what the history of that is, but if you look at the map of NS's rail system, the vast majority of it is north of Atlanta. In fact, it appears that the majority of NS is actually Conrail remnants, which in turn were PRR and NYC remnants.  And, actually, it appears that Atlanta is just the site of a large NS office (plus the Armour and Inman yards), not the actual HQ - which is (intuitively) in Norfolk. The current CEO is a GaTech grad, though...  If the Wiki article on NS is to be believed, all of their locomotive shops are north of here, with most of them in the old Conrail territory. I'm going to guess that the shop in Chattanooga is the only one inherited from Southern Railway."

HIAWATHA, LUXURY TRAIN “Among the greatest luxury passenger trains operated in this nation were the Milwaukee Road's ""Morning"" and ""Afternoon"" Hiawathas, providing convenient and fast service between Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Minneapolis. In this scene, a Hiawatha speeds over the route, c. 1958.” The Hiawathas were a fleet of named passenger trains operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (also known as the Milwaukee Road) between Chicago and various destinations in the Midwest and Western United States. The most notable of these trains was the original Twin Cities Hiawatha, which served the Twin Cities in Minnesota. The train was named for the epic poem The Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The first Hiawatha trains ran in 1935. By 1948, five routes carried the Hiawatha name: • The Twin Cities Hiawatha — the main line route from Chicago through Milwaukee to St. Paul and Minneapolis, in Morning and Afternoon editions; • The North Woods Hiawatha — a spur route off the Chicago-Minnesota main line leading from New Lisbon to Minocqua, Wisconsin; • The Chippewa-Hiawatha — connected Chicago to Ontonagon in Michigan's Upper Peninsula via Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wisconsin; • The Midwest Hiawatha — used the Milwaukee Road's mainline across Illinois and Iowa to Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Omaha, Nebraska (the train split into two parts in Manilla, Iowa); and • The Olympian Hiawatha — which traversed the Milwaukee mainline from Chicago-Twin Cities-Seattle/Tacoma. Under Amtrak, which assumed control of most intercity passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, the Hiawatha name survived in two forms. The first was a Chicago–Milwaukee–Minneapolis service, known simply as the Hiawatha. This would be renamed the Twin Cities Hiawatha, then extended to Seattle and renamed the North Coast Hiawatha. This service ended in 1979. The second was a Chicago–Milwaukee corridor known as the Hiawatha Service (as opposed to Hiawatha). Although Amtrak had retained Chicago–Milwaukee service during the transition, it did not name these trains until October 29, 1972. At this time both Hiawatha and Hiawatha Service could be found on the same timetable. Amtrak used a variety of names for this service between 1976–1989 before returning to the Hiawatha Service brand, which remains today and continues to use the Milwaukee Road's route between Chicago and Milwaukee."

Opposing residents themselves are sometimes called Nimbies.  Examples of projects likely to be opposed are fracking, homeless shelters, oil wells, chemical plants, industrial parks, military bases, wind turbines, desalination plants, landfills, incinerators, power plants, prisons,  pubs, adult entertainment establishments, firearms dealers, mobile telephone network masts, abortion clinics,  toxic waste dumps, group homes, youth hostels, sports stadiums, strip malls, housing developments, freight railway, highways, airports, seaports, and medical cannabis dispensaries along with recreational cannabis shops.  The NIMBY concept may also apply more generally to people who advocate some proposal (for example, austerity measures like budget cuts, tax increases, or layoffs), but oppose implementing it in a way that would require sacrifice on their part.    Image i - An airport is a typical example of a development that can cause a NIMBY reaction: developers may claim economic benefits for the city, while locals may benefit from improved transport links and new jobs—but they may oppose it with objections to the noise, pollution and traffic it will generate.

After seven minutes of waiting and wondering if I had actually heard something, the front of 6326 began to crawl into view; they couldn't have been going any more than 10 MPH but the power was throttled up hard. After another 7-10 minutes the power finally made it to this point, still throttled out and crawling.  EDIT: Should also be ""Eastbound"" in the title."

TrainPorn,35hpnf,Muffer-Nl,1 point,Mon May 11 10:31:34 2015 UTC,"You can't compare the flat terrain the Thalys TGV goes through with the mountainous one the Shinkansen does, with its tunnels and bridges, which drive costs up."

While the TGV is indeed a very nice train, it operates in radically different conditions from Japanese trains. Also, the TGV is burdened by enormous maintenance costs - I don't know about the Shinkansen."
TrainPorn,35hpnf,crapacitor,1 point,Mon May 11 18:55:06 2015 UTC,The TGV also goes to Swizterland.
TrainPorn,35hpnf,Muffer-Nl,1 point,Mon May 11 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"The TGV indeed goes to Switzerland, but travels quite slowly there, maximum 160kph there (too many short-radius turns). TGVs need straight lines and aren't optimized aerodynamically like the Shinkansen to minimize shockwaves in tunnels."
TrainPorn,35hpnf,crapacitor,1 point,Mon May 11 18:51:31 2015 UTC,Only the newer shinkansen are optimized like that. The major reason for the optimization is to reduce the amount of noise the train generates when entering tunnels in inhabited areas. The TGV avoids heavily populated areas as much as possible.
TrainPorn,35hpnf,Muffer-Nl,1 point,Mon May 11 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a whole bunch of different Shinkansen series that have weird-looking ""flat noses"", this one isn't the first (just do a google image search for ""shinkansen""). It's not like they can avoid populated areas in Japan...  And I maintain those trains look like they come from the future, even compared to the venerable TGV! :)"
TrainPorn,35hpnf,crapacitor,1 point,Mon May 11 19:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yes they look quite futuristic.  And they were also designed much later. The first Shinkansen with a non traditional nose was the E4 which entered service in 1997 although the distinct elongated nose didn't actually appear until the E5 which entered service in 2007, 26 years after the TGV and 40 years after the exterior of the TGV had been designed.  For a design that is currently 46 years old I think the TGV holds up very well.  Also, in the newest Shinkansen, the E7 the nose looks a lot more traditional."

TrainPorn,35hpnf,autowikibot,1 point,Mon May 11 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, as someone old enough to remember when the TGV entered service, it did indeed look super futuristic then! The newer ones look good too (especially the double-deckers ""duo"" ones) and they have some really nice technology, are extremely safe, etc. but the Japanese ones really have that special design that makes them look like they're straight out of a sci-fi movie.  Then again, the TGV, ICE and Eurostar probably look equally exotic to Japanese people."
TrainPorn,35hpnf,crapacitor,1 point,Mon May 11 21:34:57 2015 UTC,I wonder how they would look at regular IC services in Europe as most Japanese trains are local services with a large amount of stops.

TrainPorn,35gg2j,canadiancreed,5,Sun May 10 02:51:05 2015 UTC,"Road number is 4800, and /u/f40ph125 exclaimed, this particular unit is known as ""Old Rivets.""  GG1 #4800 is actually the prototype of the GG1 class. On the Pennsylvania Railroad, all locomotives until the introduction of diesel-electrics were classified by Whyte notation, regardless of power, and each letter was a wheel arrangement. On the PRR, G was 4-6-0, so the GG1 is effectively a 4-6-0+0-6-4 (two 4-6-0 put cab deck to cab deck) in terms of classification. They even have spoked wheels like a steam locomotive, sans counterweights.  Being the prototype, #4800 was riveted. All production GG1s have welded car bodies, and unlike most of the others, it was not constructed by the PRR Altoona Works, but instead General Electric on a Baldwin Locomotive Works frame. It was also originally numbered 4899, but as that number was not allowed to be a first-in-class, it swapped with the locomotive it competed with, the Westinghouse-designed R1.  Of note, the color on 4800 is Dark Green Locomotive Enamel (commonly referred to as Brunswick Green), a color which is best described as a teaspoon of green in a quart if black paint, while other members of the class wore Tuscan Red after 1952.   The GG1 class had a very long service life, entering service in 1935 on the PRR, surviving Penn Central, and ending life divided between Conrail, Amtrak, and New Jersey Transit. NJT retired the last operating GG1, #4877, in October 1983.  16 survive, with none operational due to their incompatibility with the current electrified rail network. Aside from diesel-electrics, they are the most represented class of PRR motive power of any type in preservation."
TrainPorn,35gg2j,Lamhirh,1 point,Sun May 10 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention, but the locomotive directly behind #4800 is the M1b 4-8-2 #6755 (photo Derek Ramsey, CC-BY-SA), a 1930 product of the Altoona Works. She's been sitting outside for a solid 40 years now, ever since the PRR collection left the Northumberland, PA roundhouse it once called home. The roundhouse is now little more than ruins.   The #6755 and the other surviving PRR steam present here have all had their lagging and jacketing finally removed. The RRMoPA removed them for asbestos abatement in the early 2000s, completing a task that many in preservation would now say should have been done sooner, albeit for a different reason: the sheet metal jacket that covers the lagging traps moisture in the lagging material, which accelerates corrosion of the boiler shell. This is also why the jacket has not been put back on (aside from not having anything to support it), as locomotives on outdoor display are actually better off naked (with a coat of paint)."

TrainPorn,34vxsy,canadiancreed,2,Tue May 5 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"PRR L1s #520. In PRR classification, L was assigned to 2-8-2 ""Mikado"" types (including electrics, which the PRR classed by Whyte notation for whatever reason).  The L1s shared several components--most significantly the boiler--with the K4s 4-6-2 Pacifics.  Of the surviving PRR steam roster (which is only ~19 locomotives-- including two Long Island RR G5s1 --out a fleet of thousands), she has the newest boiler. #520 suffered a boiler explosion on November 14, 1942 at Cresson, PA that killed both the engineer and brakeman, and was unusually reboilered by the PRR's Altoona Works complex rather than scrapped.   Today, with the exception of the K4s (#3750 and #redacted2 ), G5s (#5741, LIRR #35 and #39), and B6s (#60 and #1670, two different subclasses), #520 and other members of this roster are one-of-a-kind. The Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania's policy is that all locomotives in the collection are artifacts and that restoration to operation consumes the original fabric of the artifact, which in turn goes against the mission of preservation. The locomotives here, same perhaps the John Bull replica, are likely to never steam again.

There's about 234 tons of misinformation flying around out there about it, and its owners are pretty tight-lipped about what's going on despite the sizable contributions of taxpayer dollars to it  3: #643 was sold by the PRR to a steel mill in Steelton, PA outside Harrisburg and was reboilered with a radial stay firebox rather than a Belpaire sometime in the 1940s. This is the boiler it carries today.  4: #60 is displayed with an all-too-large tender from a 2-8-0 Consolidation rather than the slant back it would have had in regular service. The locomotive is in increasingly poor condition after having spent years in the weeds near Pittsburgh, PA (somehow escaping the scrap heap, almost like the PRR forgot it was there) and then moving to its current location. If I had deep pockets, I'd--as a minimum--stabilize it. If anyone wants to BUY a PRR steam locomotive, this is probably your best bet next to a $10M check to build a T1 from scratch.  5: This comment is a reference to numerous staff comments from the Strasburg Rail Road (SRC), which leased and operated #1223 from 1965-1989. The locomotive always had problems with its spark arrestor and would set brush along the line on fire on almost every run. SRC actually had someone following the train in a track car putting the fires out. The primadonna part comes from her ""personality"" if you will--if you paid too much attention to 31, 89, etc and didn't do whatever maintenance she THOUGHT you should do (not just what you had to), she'd throw a fit and just...break. One time, she shore off not one, but BOTH main crank pins at the same time. She was like ""You didn't pamper me! F you, I'm done!""  6: #7002 (E2s)/#8063 (E7sa) was an odd case. The entire E7 class are basically upgraded E2-class locomotives, which #7002 was. #7002 claimed a still-disputed speed record of 127.1 MPH on the Ft. Wayne racetrack near Elida, OH. Later, when the PRR was looking for an E2s/E7s to preserve, they realized that #7002 had scrapped and ""corrected"" the problem by taking an E7sa that was rebuilt from an E2s, #8063, and back-dating it to masquerade as #7002. As part of these shenanigans, the PRR gave the locomotive a full class 3 rebuild in Altoona in preparation for the 1939 World's Fair, TOWED it to New York, and afterwards tucked it away as a relic. It was never fired up after that rebuild. In the 1980s, SRC leased it from the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, which inherited the entire PRR collection from Penn Central and housed it across PA 741 from SRC. When they lit her off, the staybolts in the firebox were still shiny from that class 3. In hindsight, SRC has acknowledged that they should have never done that, as they effectively destroyed the only example of a class 3 rebuild of an Altoona Works/Juniata Shops locomotive done by its builder. She also ran like a dog on SRC (was great on the mainline though), and in about 10 short years, her firebox was worn too thin for regulations. Granted, the PRR got only 2 years out of a firebox at the most...  7: LIRR #39 is owned by the Railroad Museum of Long Island, which maintains collections at Riverhead and Greenport, NY. Upon evaluating their potential operational climate for #39 upon inheriting the locomotive, whose restoration had been very intermittent since the 1980s, it was determined that the current LIRR was not going to allow #39 on the system without major changes (including a fuel conversion, which #35 is getting). Instead, an agreement was reached with the Strasburg Rail Road (who were working on the boiler at the time) to lease #39 to SRC for 48 years in exchange for approximately half the restoration cost (total approx. $1.9M USD).  I apologize for the complete wall-of-text treatment (short of photos of every locomotive listed)...ok, I'm not sorry. But it's hard for me to be a railfan and live in Altoona without knowing this stuff."
TrainPorn,34vxsy,Lamhirh,1 point,Sat May 9 23:46:25 2015 UTC,Ok I'm linking this for every post I make involving trains. Thats quite informative!  As for #4 too bad I didn't have the pockets.....and a right of way. Trying to find steam engines to restore is like looking for hens teeth. Especially in Canada it seems.
TrainPorn,34vxsy,Lamhirh,2,Sun May 10 00:50:24 2015 UTC,"It's not like you can pull one off the dealer's lot no matter where you are these days. Your choices are deal with old, heavily used stock, or build new. Sometimes building new is smarter, and in some cases your only option grumble grumble LNER A1 Peppercorn grumble PRR T1 grumble grumble because they're already all razor blades.  Even so, and  while I haven't made the trek down to Hockessin myself to stick my head in the firebox door myself, I'd wager #60 is in ugly mechanical shape. Explaining that requires a bit of a story.  The Pennsy was nothing if not predictable--if one of their surviving locomotives (that wasn't set aside like #7002 or 1223) was in kinda nasty shape, the others probably are too. At the end of steam (final withdrawals were in 1957/8 on the PRR), they were limping the fleet along just long enough til the Geeps showed up. A lot of maintenance was ""get it to the next stop"" at the time. PRR's steam fleet was TIRED. The PRR had spent a ridiculous amount of resources electrifying what is now the Northeast Corridor from DC to NYC and the line from Harrisburg to Philadelphia. So much was spent that while successful, they never recovered the full cost and weren't able to modernize the rest of their motive power. The most modern steam locomotives they owned were the 4-4-4-4 T1 duplexes, a class of 52 that had a ton of alleged problems (which may have been caused by poor training), and the J1 2-10-4, which was a C&O design copied during WWII (and likely why none were spared despite their success).  By the late 1930s, PRR passenger power was PRIMARILY K4s Pacifics. The design predated WWI (Prototype #1737 was built 1914, scrapped and had #3750 as its doppelganger for a long time), and as train weight increased, the locomotives couldn't keep up, especially in the more mountainous terrain between Altoona and Pittsburgh (Horseshoe Curve is a 1.45% ruling grade over 2,375 feet) and were often double/triple-headed--the PRR had spare locomotives displaced by electrification, but paying extra crews and fuel was only compounding problems.  When the last of the fleet was retired, it was rode hard and put up wet. In the case of #1361, Altoona asked for a K4 for display, and she was likely pulled from the back of a scrap deadline. At that time, her original boiler was already gone, having been replaced with #3844's (casting stamps match the #3844's builder's plate number instead of #1361's) due to wear, and while 30 years of outdoor display at the Curve didn't help matters, she was...not as sound as they thought when they pulled her down and revived her. A year of operation and she had a catastrophic main axle bearing failure that caused a (relatively minor) derailment near York, PA. It was limped back to Lewistown, PA, where Standard Steel cobbled together a temporary bearing to get it home, and operated at low speed til the end of 1988. When they took it apart, they found way more wrong than they should have. Her smokebox was so thin near the steam pipes, you could kick a hole thru it. Her firebox needed extensive rebuilding. In the intermittent years, a lot of crap has plagued her--from a replacement smokebox, a ""faulty"" firebox design (sheets too thin/staybolt spacing), the upper portion of the steamdome course has been patched, the front flue sheet has been patched, with more to be done.  So why is that relevant?   PRR #60 has never been put indoors since retirement. And was also likely worn out. #1361 has/will consume a total of about $7M (there were some...oversights I didn't talk about). #60 is smaller (it's a yard goat, after all), but it'd still be expensive If money were no object, sure, have fun. If I had $50M, I'd buy a T1, pay off a G5, buy a B6sa, and give an organization an endowment large enough to sustain itself while it fixes it's biggest asset. But I can't. I don't even have the funds for a little 0-4-0T Vulcan that's missing steam pipes and a third of its front flue sheet (that locomotive was the last steam locomotive to operate in regular service in the general Altoona area and has been outside until recently)."

TrainPorn,34dvsh,WhateverJoel,2,Thu Apr 30 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"One could argue that ""Surviving"" is a stretch. The outer shell of the locomotive has survived and lives at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, VA.  When Norfolk Southern terminated the steam program in the 90s, 611 came in off an excursion, dumped fire, cleaned up a little and was rolled into the museum mostly complete. 1218 was in the middle of overhaul, so the visible pieces were put back together and almost everything else went for scrap.  611 was an expensive beast to rebuild, and it was largely complete. 1218 will need a lot of pieces to be machined without any patterns to go by. I know many people said it about 611, and have said it about many other locos now plying the rails, but I will be very surprised if 1218 ever runs under its own power again."

TrainPorn,33sagk,keot,2,Sat Apr 25 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"Advanced Passenger Train:       The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was an experimental tilting high speed train developed by British Rail during the 1970s and early 1980s, for use on the West Coast Main Line, which contained a lot of curves. Notable among numerous technical advancements was the active tilting system, which the APT pioneered and has since appeared on other designs around the world. Other features of the APT such as the hydrokinetic braking, used to stop the train within existing separations, have not been adopted.  The experimental version APT-E achieved a new British railway speed record when on 10 August 1975 it hit 152.3 mph (245.1 km/h).

A number of successful modifications were made to the class, helping the class to survive for over 40 years, and leading to several later batches being built.

TrainPorn,331xrl,jagneta,7,Sat Apr 18 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"Original photo by Jari Kuusinen (not me) at http://vaunut.org/kuva/99916  The loco is a test unit from Siemens Prüfcentrum Wegberg-Wildenrath, and it will be returned to Germany in June or July, after completing test drives in Finland. The picture was taken soon after the arrival of the shipment, and the loco is not set up for electrification yet, but is being pushed by a Dv12. The class designation of the new loco will likely be Sr3 (Sähköveturi, raskas = electric locomotive, heavy).   The Finnish state-owned operator VR has ordered 80 units, with an option for a further 97. Their web page about the new locomotive shows the planned green livery. The plan is to test this unit in Finland for the coming months, then test a prototype built specifically for VR in 2016, and to have the first ten units in use in 2017. Finnish railways have a 1524 mm gauge and a wider loading gauge than most of Western Europe, and then there are climate considerations."
TrainPorn,331xrl,Numbers_Station,6,Sat Apr 18 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"That planned green livery is really nice! Though, I wonder why they didn't do a white body with a green stripe/lettering akin to the Sr1 or Sr2 classes. Too much of a similarity, perhaps?  Since these are essentially replacing the Sr1 class, I found an interesting photograph of an Sr1 pulling (pushing? Can't be too sure) the Vectron test unit.  I also found another shot, this time from Siemens. Looks like this is an idea of what these will look like in service in a few years. It appears to have a slightly different livery that the other one you've linked, but still looks really good!"
TrainPorn,331xrl,f40ph125,4,Sat Apr 18 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"The first photo you linked is from the Helsinki Central Station, which is a terminus, so the Sr1 likely pushed the Vectron there and pulled it out (station building behind the camera). The white office buildings in the background are these.  The livery in the second picture is fairly close to the white-green livery that's in use in the current rolling stock. The all-green one on the VR site is a new design that I haven't seen on any train in real life yet. I suppose we'll find out maybe next year how they'll paint/tape the prototype. Btw., that picture shows the difference between the loading gauges: the Vectron is probably 2.8 m wide, and the Finnish double-decker car behind it is 3.2 m. The production series of the Vectron is apparently going to be Siemens's standard width, not 3.2 m. The Sr2 is also 2.8 m wide, i.e. usually narrower than the cars behind it.  Here are all photos tagged Sr3 on the enthusiast site the posted photo is from: http://vaunut.org/kuvat/?tt=2&i1=USr3 The test unit was shown to the public at Helsinki Central on the 7th of this month."

TrainPorn,32v7wi,kittsville,2,Fri Apr 17 10:39:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about trains really, but I know that for propellers on planes they prefer to have pullers rather than pushers.   A pusher can try to slip above/below the wing and cause vibrations while a puller simply pulls the wing after it. This is one reason that jet engines slant 'forward' or ahead of the wing instead of just dangling beneath.   Maybe pusher trains have to deal with the same type of buckling on heavy loads?"
TrainPorn,32v7wi,DingleberryDouchebag,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly, although with trains I think they use varied power between the engines, to ensure the engines distributed through the train are always pulling rather than pushing."

Ok then, please give me an example of what each of these types of people would do. 8 Answers  •  Rail  Best Answer (Chosen by Asker) These are hobbyists who enjoy railroading and railroad operations.  Though the association is always made with reference to ""foamers,"" as frothing at the mouth as would a rabid dog, but the truth is, that isn't how the term originated.  The Western Pacific (now the UP) runs the ""Feather River Route"" eastward along the Feather River to Portola and beyond.  The timber industry has now been gutted, but at the time there were a lot pollutants being dumped into the river upstream, primarily waste from mills and stagnant log ponds.  This caused the formation of copious amounts of foam in back washes and eddies along the river, a favorite place for rail buffs and photographers.  Often times, these people would wade into the river to get the right angle for a photo, usually knee deep or deeper amidst the foam, hence the moniker was applied; ""Foamers.""  Its meaning has been upgraded to describe an over zealous aficionado of rail operations."""

About 50 feet (15 m) from the cabin there was a rail track carrying 3 or more trains per day.   Length varied from a single engine with no wagons to i think the longest i saw was around 30 wagons.   Engines was either ""RC-loket"" or ""T43-Diesel""  Even better is that the neighbor next door was an retired locomotive operator who knew the operators personally.  Every day we where at the cabin, me and my brother stood next to the track to wave to the drivers, getting a whistle and a wave back every time.   Best memory was one morning the neighbor told us he had a surprise for us and we should be ready for the two a clock train cause it was ""special"".  And sure enough at 2 a train came like always but this time it STOPPED right next to the cabin, and the driver pick up me, my brother and the neighbor as we got to ride along to the railyard only a couple of miles down the track, a short ride but my best memory as a child for sure.  Wow this became more text that i thought. Sorry about that. As English is not my first language, sorry for any errors.  tl;dr Boy and his younger brother waves every day to trains, finally gets a ride along, becomes a great memory for life."

Lots of money floating around and the chance for any crazy idea that works to be incorporated into the whole fleet and create enormous savings.    Just like everywhere, though, it was usually the less sexy, less off-the-wall ideas that really prospered.  Turbines?  Not so much.  Roller bearings?  Yes please.  I’ll take 100,000.  My wife’s grandfather has been in the rail business since 1944 and still works 4 days a week.  My favorite story of his of a prototype like this was an attempt to put disk brakes on rail cars, rather than the drum brakes that are the standard.  To test the idea, they got a locomotive with one car (equipped with the brakes and test equipment) up to 110mph and then uncoupled.  He and a couple other engineers rode in that loose car for a bit and then hit the brakes.  He says that they were all terrified that the thing would leap off the track at any moment, it was shaking so badly."

Mallard required an overhaul after hitting 126mph, all the white metal bearing spaces were re-metaled. It was a publicity stunt by the LNER, not common practice. Rumours are just that, and they relied on the accuracy of the cab speedometer. Mallard had had a dyno coach on the back for proper speed calculations. To add to the conversation about the side rods, the wheels also have counterweights to offset the weight of the attached valve gear."
TrainPorn,31k0th,ItsMeLewisP,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"You also need to consider that:   the track on stoke bank was 25+ years old when mallard set her record, so that would have affected her running characteristics at the time, Mallard also had to go through a speed restriction just before the summit of the bank after the war metal manufacturing techniques had improved greatly (in the process of developing stronger armour for tanks, ships, etc. metal as a whole would have been stronger), they also used roller bearings After the war the valve timings were altered and set using much more accurate methods, giving superior running, greater fuel efficiency (consumed less coal per mile), and maintenance costs were reduced. the side valances (or side-plates) were removed during the war to ease with maintenance, this to a certain extent solved the problem of over-heating by allowing fresh air in between the frames. all the supposed cases of A4s exceeding mallard's record happened because drivers were behind time and decided to take a risk by pushing them as hard as they dare. the in-cab speedometers are more accurate than you give credit for, else how would they be able to use them to keep within the speed limits, and the driver that pushed it to that speed said ""Around 140"" so for all we know it could have been 138, but that's still near 140 MPH   all of the tales came forth during the A4 gathering at york in 2013, when drivers who regularly drove the A4s in service met and swapped stories, and, totally by chance, began to recall times that they had pushed A4s down Stoke bank, they didn't intend to discredit Mallard's record, mind you, they were just a bunch of old drivers swapping stories and experiences"

TrainPorn,31e18u,michaelconfoy,5,Sat Apr 4 04:23:48 2015 UTC,A cool thing to note is the headlight cone on the Santa Fe diesel. This was used to prevent the headlight from being scene from planes as a precaution against potential WWII air attacks.

TrainPorn,31bfeb,Gaggamaggot,2,Fri Apr 3 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"That is so strange seeing a GE with a teardrop window.  Even the new EMD's in the states have the rectangular window.  Did Rio Tinto de-rate the AC6000's like the US roads did, or did they find a way around the problems with the high horsepower diesels?"
TrainPorn,31bfeb,hangingfrog,2,Sat Apr 4 02:31:18 2015 UTC,"Rio never had AC 6000s, only BHP did. Rio's GEs in the video are 4400 HP with radiators from the 6000s. Btw, that's my video, don't know how it ended up here!"

TrainPorn,316ki3,Didgeridoox,3,Thu Apr 2 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"Based on most everything else in North Korea, they are probably Chinese hand-me-downs."
TrainPorn,316ki3,DaWolf85,7,Thu Apr 2 17:12:54 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure. Before the soviet union broke down they got technology from every soviet country. So it could be a European locomotive also.
TrainPorn,316ki3,Guybrush_Deepthroat,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:28:13 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Or maybe it's one of those Chinese knock-offs of a Soviet hand-me-down? :D
TrainPorn,316ki3,DaWolf85,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:00:12 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, since USSR/Russia has a broader gauge than the standard gauge used in most of the world. I do know some of the East German Taigatrommels went to North Korea though."
TrainPorn,316ki3,EmperorJake,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"The gauge difference is so small that steam engines made for Russian gauge can be modified to run on standard gauge. In the US an example of this were the Russian decapods, which were built by Baldwin (IIRC) for Russian railways, but were stranded in the US because of the revolution. They were fitted with extra-wide tires and sold to various American railroads. There are several preserved in the US still, and one in working order."

Edit: Given to North Korea by the Soviet Union, maybe."
TrainPorn,316ki3,OneOfTooMany,2,Thu Apr 2 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"That thing on the side of the locomotive on left looks a bit like ČKD logo. Which is quite possible, because Czechoslovakia was delivering a lot of stuff to the North Korea. But who knows."

TrainPorn,30zk10,theyeticometh,3,Wed Apr 1 02:51:08 2015 UTC,I've run trains from Denver to Provo and this section is just about my favorite. Up there with Glenwood Canyon.  Addition: after checking I may be the only BNSF conductor federally licensed/qualified conductor to operate trains between Denver and Provo. I can tie trains down like a mofo.  60 brakes bare or stfu. No brake-sticks.  I almost died at east portal (-30 at 100 mph) with blow over restrictions for trains while I knocked off handbrakes for a blown in (snow packed) train.  100% handbrakes!? Yes please!
TrainPorn,30zk10,apaulo26,2,Wed Apr 1 15:39:44 2015 UTC,Do you ever get so taken back by the scenery that you get fearful that you will miss a signal or something?

It just currently runs at NCRY since they lost their space at Hunter's Point a few years back.  The organizations have not merged, and thus they advertise separately.  Check GGRM.org.  Also, this weekend was completely sold out.  2472 typically runs 3 weekends a year; March, May (Memorial Day), and Labor day."

TrainPorn,30f6pv,InterdimensionalMan,2,Thu Mar 26 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"Question for those of you more well versed with railroad apparatuses:  Why does the locomotive have 2 sets of headlights? I can imagine the large red is for when the engine is trailing, but the double headlights have me stumped. Are they Mars lights?"
TrainPorn,30f6pv,boredtacos19,3,Fri Mar 27 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"Southern Pacific had a unique light package, one set is the normal headlight, the other is a rotating light for grade crossing safety. The red rotating light was used when there was an emergency brake application, to warn oncoming trains that there might be a derailment"
TrainPorn,30f6pv,dageekywon,2,Fri Mar 27 08:51:05 2015 UTC,"The red light was sometimes used as well if the engine was on the end of the train for some reason, they would light it solid, or turn on the steady headlight in Dim mode."
TrainPorn,30f6pv,InterdimensionalMan,2,Fri Mar 27 16:27:04 2015 UTC,Ah so a mars light. Thanks for the extra info!
TrainPorn,30f6pv,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Fri Mar 27 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"It's a real shame that this one was cancelled.  Amtrak said it was a commuter train, SP said it was a regional train, and it died on A-day, despite what I'm told was a not-terrible ridership  The tracks have since retreated a fair ways, and the junction has been removed in Castroville.  It's a train that would probably see rather fair ridership if someone ever tried to re-create it, though it would take a lot of track construction.    I understand the official local plan is to create a diesel light-rail line  along the Monterey Branch instead"
TrainPorn,30cda7,michaelconfoy,5,Thu Mar 26 05:25:42 2015 UTC,The oncoming locomotive is a DL-109. Nice pic.
