comedywriting,3dyxx9,harryhartounian,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"The idea is solid, but the premise needs to change directions. The only thing I was thinking while reading was evolution and how every generation knows how to have sex. Maybe something along the lines of how weird it is that it ended up this way. thank god there's a mechanism built in to stop too much sex (painful erections).   Or maybe, why did we have to evolve to be able to face each other? No one wants to see me have sex, least of all the person I'm doing it to.   Or something on how, because it's so pleasurable, we feel the need to cover up those parts. Maybe, then, conservative Muslims are into some really freaky sex/ thank god we don't fuck with our eyes."

comedywriting,3cva5a,srronan,2,Sat Jul 11 01:47:05 2015 UTC,Seems like it could be really funny if you have a bigger lead up to the frat bro dental surgeon reveal.
comedywriting,3cva5a,Cgul325,2,Sat Jul 11 02:13:23 2015 UTC,A dartmouth dentist would be a funny setup for that
comedywriting,3cva5a,kproxurworld,2,Sun Jul 12 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"I think this would work better if it were framed as the only problem with the dentist. Like you like this dentist except for this one thing. Make it clear that he's a bro, but paint it as something you like. Like he's free with the high fives and lets his employees wear visors if they want.   Also, there's usually a rule that, if you break, you're fair game. One that I remember is if you fall asleep with your shoes on, you're fair game.   So something like, ""the only problem was when I got my wisdom teeth out. I forgot to take my shoes off before he put me to sleep, and I had to walk out with a penis drawn on my face""  Or you could use the shoes as a tag. ""the only problem was when I had my wisdom teeth taken out. He put me to sleep, and when I woke up I had a penis drawn on my face. But in his defense, I fell asleep with my shoes on."""
comedywriting,3cva5a,gunnarrambo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:13:20 2015 UTC,I'd turn it into a story and make it sound like it actually happened instead of just an obvious fake joke.  It'd be a hilarious punchline if the dentist was someone you knew that actually did do that.
comedywriting,3cva5a,themiddlekidd,0,Tue Jul 14 06:34:55 2015 UTC,Cut either the head shave or penis on face. You only need one. Plus they both neutralise the imagery of the other.  The idea of falling asleep conventionally and waking up to a fair game cock is good.  Maybe brainstorm about other places this happens.  A sufferer of narcolepsy with a particularly obnoxious carer could be funny. The could call shotgun when obviously their job is to drive patients etc.  I tend to drive stand up into sketch most of the time so probably isn't all that applicable.

comedywriting,39qiis,R_sib,2,Sat Jun 13 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"It's not to my taste so I won't comment too much on the subject matter but I can give you some general advice.  The Justin Roiland reference has got to go. It's either you know what he sounds like or you don't. Make it easy on the actor and don't send them on a wild YouTube goose chase figuring out what character he voices and THEN infer what characteristics you like. Just use blanket descriptions -- old, raspy, energetic. /r/writing has a ton of cool webtools to generate descriptive ideas...I would def sub that if you haven't.  Found a few typos. Reading lines aloud will help you snuff these out. Which leads me to my next point...  I would recommend taking what you have here and recording! Read some lines directly and riff on it as your record. If you have an actor try writing some lines for them to read on the fly. Then get it into an editing app and cut the fat. You could then transcribe the finished cut and compare it to your original script and see how it's changed, what worked, what didn't work.  With comedy so much relies on performance. You can write the best joke in the world and if the timing is off it will never work. What you have written here is nothing you need to get hung up on and try and write your way out of though. But if you want to invest the time making this one, you might try new ideas/adjust when you record.  Good luck/post more!"

comedywriting,39mzah,gunnarrambo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"I would prefer not to mention where I took the writing class, though it was in a different state.  They had a fantastic improv program.  I was in the beginning stages of the sketch writing, and they probably got better.    It was very poorly formed.  For example we had to all write about our first kiss.  No setup, that was our goal.  We ALL wrote about the events leading up to the first kiss, when we were supposed to write about the action of the actual kiss.  We found out about that when the teacher told us after we started reading our stuff to each other.  Overall the students in the class were hell of supportive, but I learned nothing.    I did take a one off workshop with Beth Appel from UCB in a third state and learned a shit ton in 3 hours.  At the end it was one person writing solo, but to start involved multiple people.  My goal is to make short web stuff and slowly expand that to full length movies.  Louis CK is the best linear example I can think of, though I'm think of starting at Andy Kaufmann leading to Judd Apatow with a realistic viewpoint on all this.  I have no special interest in TV or stage, though both sound like fun.  In improv I have no problems creating, though I do better reacting than starting.  In writing I'm totally stuck."

I'm also an English Major, and honestly I do feel that my comedic writing abilities have benefitted. If your overall writing abilities are improving, then that's gonna find its way into improving your comedy, even if it's on the technical side of things. Word choice, concision, syntax, etc., are all important. A good comedy writer is a writer who has applied aspects of good writing to comedy. Comedians are good with words. That's a writer's trait.  Also, lots of writers are hilarious. Nonfiction writers especially. David Sedaris comes to mind immediately. David Foster Wallace wrote a great essay that's hilarious. John Jeremiah Sullivan is good too.  Here's the thing: if you're only majoring in English because of comedy, then I think you should reconsider. I'm majoring in English because I love literature, and I love talking/writing about it. If it's between English and film, if say English, since you care more about the writing. Yes, that might make you less eligible for certain internships, but I can't imagine that every network is going to only take film majors. I think they'll mostly be concerned with the writing. And if that's good, it'll speak for itself."

comedywriting,349gfj,Bill_Murray_Movies,3,Wed Apr 29 10:44:49 2015 UTC,"Walking in to my house I knew something was awry. Three unicorns parked outside my house, eating my grass, and shitting all over my yard. My front door, which leads directly to my living room, was unlocked, welcoming me to another boring couple of hours in what I call 'my life'. ""Honey, I'm home!"" I shout sarcastically. Three angels sitting in my living room - their faces painted eager. ""Sit down, Mitchell. We have much to discuss.""  This has happened before. These three bores turn up like clockwork trying to get me to alter my lifestyle. A lifestyle I very much enjoy, I should add. Angel Clive, one of the first angels to ever take an interest in me, removes a large slab of stone from the inside of his robe and holds it high above his head like Link finding a sword for the first time. A small red dot appears on the stone pointing towards the first inscription: 'I am the Lord thy God.' It's Dave the Angel with his laser pen.  ""First thing's first, I'm the realest."" exclaims Dave, much to the enjoyment of the other angels. ""You know, like Iggy Azalea? It's like Iggy Azalea, Mitchell.""  Welcome, everybody. This is the reality of having Guardian Angels.  ""As you know by now, rule #1 must always be announced and understood before proceedings can, well, proceed. God is life. God is eternal. God is love."" All three angels gently sweep the floor with their right hand, make a cross on their chests, kiss their fingers and point towards the sky. Every sportsman has got this spot on by the way. I have no idea how.  The laser pointer moves down. ""#2, Mitchell. 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me'. We have gone through this before so why do you still insist on calling yourself the 'God of Mario Karts'?  ""Pick up that pad and I'll show you""  Angel John motioned to pick up the pad. He always does. He's like that one friend who, even though he knows he is going to be beaten in to furious rage, he will always play.  ""Angel John, no! His Rainbow Road game is too strong, we have been witness to this in the past. Whilst we acknowledge your prowess we must insist you drop the 'God' title from your nickname. It says right here on this large slab of stone that you aren't allowed to do that. Do I require a larger laser pointer?""  ""I'm not dropping the God moniker until John over there picks up the pad and beats me""  Angel John instantly goes for the pad. ""JOHN, I SAID NO!"" bellows Angel Dave.  The laser pointer shoots down to the inscription 'Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy'. ""May I ask, Mitchell, just how have you been keeping the sabbath day holy?""  ""I haven't. I'm not even sure how to keep the sabbath day holy.""  ""He's not sure how to keep the sabbath day holy. Angel Clive, enlighten Mitchell for me, please""  Angel Clive, still holding the heavy slab of stone above his head, looked a little puzzled. ""Well, on the seventh day God rested. Which was good. So I rest too. Bit of Playstation 4 and just pig out. I really like the HD remake of The Last of Us.""  Angel Dave looked bemused. ""Are you fucking kidding, Angel Clive?"" Yes the Last of Us HD remake was very, very good but we aren't here to discuss Playstation 4. We're here to make Mitchell a better person. Just start keeping the sabbath day holy. Go to church or something. MOVING ON.""  Out of the corner of my eye I can see John now has hold of the GameCube pad he was denied earlier on. ""I know you can hear me, Mitchell. I'm a fucking Angel. Telepathy is one of my many talents. I'm going to wreck you on Karts the second this farce of an intervention finishes. I'll be playing the harp for the final lap such will be the magnitude of my destruction. Eternal damnation via the power of red shells ..""  Angel Dave interrupts "".. Angel John, we can all hear everything you're saying to Mitchell telepathically. We are Angels too. We have identical powers. He beats you every time you play him.""  “This time will be different”  “It’s never different, Angel John. You play, you get beat, you say the game is fake and then go home.""  ""I don't want to hold the slab anymore"" admits Angel Clive.  ""You see what you have caused, Angel John? Now Angel Clive doesn't want to hold the slab anymore. Can you remember how long it took us to convince him to hold the slab?""  ""I just want one shot at him on Rainbow Road."" adamantly states Angel John.  ""Fine. Boot the GameCube up. But after the God of Karts beats you we are going through the Commandments again."""

comedywriting,344007,morphfromdusseldorf,2,Tue Apr 28 02:59:44 2015 UTC,"Hi - you are obviously trying something pretty difficult and your readers have to know the movie beforehand. To be honest, it was good but the movie you are parodying is very difficult to pull off. So that said;   Easy stuff first - a couple of typos in there - Leonard was misspelled once - one dialogue w/ Natalie there are too many 'justs' in the sentence. In your Scene prompts, your BLACK and WHITE switch from straight caps to cap italics.   I thought there was a good set up for a computer memory joke that was missed - instead IT states they have amnesia - like they are a doctor. Basically, the IT voice doesn't respond as to how I would imagine an IT person would. For example, you wrote: Sir, I am not sure what you are trying to say. Maybe you can tell me the street you grew up on or your mother’s maiden name.   My experience is that an IT won't give you an option of a password to ask. Nor does this sound like someone with an Indian accent.   I don't know if he'd have the password prompts tattooed as FACTS (maiden name). Shouldn't they be the actual passwords? That seems funnier to me.   There should be a more descriptive bit about his body tattoos - I'd suggest have them all be passwords - even one saying 'password'. I think you touched on that with JohnnyG123 but it isn't clear.   The Prince of Nigeria bit was funny but caption for photo should read NOT Prince of Nigeria. And who is the picture of? Teddy?   Ok, hope that helps - you've picked a challenging idea to tackle! Keep writing!"

I guess it would be funnier if I hit more so on him just having tons of passwords but not knowing what websites they're for instead of those prompts/hints.  Yea, I was thinking the picture would be of Teddy but maybe that doesn't make sense?

comedywriting,33aq8t,youngmermaid,2,Tue Apr 21 00:14:56 2015 UTC,"You're going to have long odds just 'finding a comedy writing agent'.  The truth is you need to already be producing work at high level of some kind (spec scripts, active sketch groups, online video sketch, stand up) before anyone is going to care.  If you're already established with work, you need to find venues to get it out so an agent looking for talent can find it.  You also might want to start submitting to CollegeHumor, Funny or Die, McSweeneys, and the like.  Just do anything and everything to get your writing out there.  Additionally, you might want to try various studio run workshops.  These are highly competitive, and not necessarily based in NY, but they're a good option if you don't have the performer heart to get your own material out there.  Most of these are once-a-year type things, so remember them when the time rolls around.  http://televisionworkshop.warnerbros.com/ http://www.nbcunicareers.com/late-night-writers-workshop https://www.hbo.com/hboaccess/"

The neighborhood liked to call him a 'little kid lover.'  I know a lot of pedophiles, actually. A couple of friends took me to Chuck E. Cheese for a birthday party. None of us have kids, but one of the guys spent a lot of time in the ball pit. Those kids know how to party.   It got a little crazy, the cops showed up. But it's cool, I knew these guys growing up.

He loves them so much that everyone in town came up with this great nickname for him. Little kid guy. He uses that as his email too. Oh and his screen name for chat rooms. At least that's what it was in the episode of To Catch a Predator we saw him in.  You know. My friends are pretty good with kids too.

comedywriting,30yqv3,harryhartounian,3,Tue Mar 31 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"Tinder uses real names. I know you wrote Tindr, but it's going to be pronounced the same, so either call the app something different or drop the names. My vote is for dropping the names. Even if a site has profile names, people introduce themselves before meeting.   What would you say the premise of this sketch is? It's a little muddy right now. It could be ""a date where both people have scheduled two dates at once."" It could be ""two people look for new dates while on dates."" Either premise could work, but together they're fighting for stage time. (Your premise is not ""A man and woman on a date in the Swipe Right era of love and Tindrness."")  My vote is for a date where both people are actively looking for something better.    One thing that's important to ask yourself when writing a sketch is this: ""What's keeping this person from just leaving."" Most people in most situations they don't like will just leave.  The first two people you see in this sketch no reason to stay. Sure, they're on a date, but neither seems interested by the other person, and the only thing they talk about before one leaves is how they lied in their profiles. People are going to assume the girl left to escape out the window.    Normally, I would say get to your premise before the fifth line, but because your characters don't have an established relationship, and that relationship is important to the rest of the scene, you can give it more time to develop.   You want at least one real exchange that shows that they like each other. You want to establish that they've found something good, but they still think they could do better.   Then, when they betray each other to find better people, that betrayal will actually mean something.   And finally, a five page sketch is only short for SNL.   If you don't want to change all those things, I could see your sketch working as a reality show, using Kroll show as a model. Make it really fast with chyrons on screen as people label each other with their usernames. Maybe flash their actual profiles on the screen. Otherwise, Twilight Gurl isn't going to read because you pronounce gurl and girl the same way."
comedywriting,30yqv3,gunnarrambo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"Great notes! Thanks a ton!  I would pose the premise as ""What happens when technology affords immediate access to every flavor of disposable sex, and dating/sex is limited only by the extent of our vanity and fetishes?"" Certainly the double dating imbroglio is a big part of the ""game"", but moreso a byproduct of the devaluation of actual courting. That was the intent at least.  I don't feel as though your advised premise (""a date where both people are seeking something better"") and the one described (""two people dating in the swipe right era..."") are necessarily mutually exclusive? Admittedly I am not skilled in the art of Tinder dating (as evidenced by the ""Tindr"" spelling, which was nothing more than an oversight on my part). But it seems to me that it's entirely feasible for people to indulge nothing but the more base instincts in this new dating scene; such as the option to look for something better at all times, as you mentioned .  Do you really think it's worthwhile to establish a rapport between the two? I feel that might be just a barrier to any heightening. The game, in theory at least, is the cutting of formality. Any unnecessary conversation only delays the desired sexy endgame for both parties.  Though it might not play, I thought a fun part of the heightening would for the people to refer to each other by their vapid online names. If you have any thoughts on a way to implement that, or if it's just omething to cut, feel free to let me know.  Thanks again! Those were really helpful points."
comedywriting,30yqv3,gunnarrambo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"It's not that they're mutually exclusive, yours is simply not a premise. The premise of a sketch is what drives the comedy, not what inspires it. A premise is a sketch's core comedic idea, usually summed up in one sentence. If you handed me this script and told me nothing about it, neither ""two people dating in the swipe right era"" nor ""What happens when ... vanity and fetishes?"" tell me I'm about to read a sketch.   What you've written is ""A man tries to return a dead parrot to the pet store."" You're missing the unusual nugget: ""And the owner refuses to believe it's dead.""  You've got three possible premises in your sketch. I listed two above, and you've suggested a third that I didn't see in the sketch. (two people on dates with two people/two people on dates while looking for new people to date/two people on a date where one or both have dropped all the formality of traditional dating).  Any of those would be a good premise, the problem is that they're all in there together fighting for attention. Heightening works best if there's a clear game. If there are competing games, the audience can't follow the heightening and you lose the impact that comes with setting a pattern and breaking it with a heightening.   This is why UCB teaches that you can't have more than one game in a scene. They say one unusual thing makes a sketch, two takes you to crazy town, which is where this sketch is currently. (There are plenty of funny sketches that have more than one game, but it's a common source of problems and good advice for new writers)  I think it's essential to establish the rapport if and only if they're going to be leaving each other for better people later in the sketch. I suggested focusing on that because that's the game your sketch hits hardest already.   The cutting of formality did not come across to me in your sketch as written. But if that's what you want to focus on, they don't need to establish rapport. It might be better if they don't. But I don't follow from the cutting of formality leading scheduling two dates at once or the girl having a bunch of dates there lined up.   If you want to explore how online dating cuts through the formality of dating, you need to spend some time thinking about what those formalities are. What are the formalities of traditional dating? What are the formalities of online dating? How are online dating and traditional dating similar? How are they different? Do you want to focus on one, the other or both?   If you want to focus on cutting the formality of traditional dating, don't limit yourself to tinder. Think about all things afforded us by modern society. 3D printing, Google, drones, Dr. Oz, email forwards, cameras everywhere, Amazon's mechanical turk, outsourcing.   As for the usernames. It's not something people do in real life, so I see it as the fourth unusual thing you're trying to put into this sketch. It might be a fine list sketch, but it's also probably been done many times before.   And I would always advise you research any topic you're unfamiliar with before attempting to skewer it."
comedywriting,30yqv3,jimhodgson,2,Wed Apr 1 04:56:20 2015 UTC,I liked it. And I don't care if Tindr uses real names. This ain't serious news reporting. It's comedy writing. Facts are nothing.   I think you could trim things down a bit. 4 minutes and change is a relatively long sketch. But otherwise good work!
comedywriting,30u4dg,RAPTOREXPLOSION,4,Mon Mar 30 18:57:19 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of ways to do it  Most sketch shows are writer driven  I like to write a premise, bring it to the group, get feedback, write the first draft, get feedback on that, write, feedback, repeat until done.   I think most writers rooms operate the way above. Key and Peele does. Kroll Show does. Amy Schumer does. If you take a UCB class, this is how they operate at the 101 level.   Some sketch shows are improv driven.  In the Kids in the Hall, at least before they had a TV show, one of them would come to the group with a premise, they'd improvise a scene, run to typewriters to write down what worked, then perform it again and again, hoping to make it funnier each time.   For the UCB TV show, I'm pretty sure they'd rework scenes from their improv shows.  And some are a mix.  At Human Giant they'd write the bare bones of a sketch and then improvise a lot of set. For instance, half the jokes in this were not in the shooting script.   Idea Generation  If you're out of ideas and you have a show in two weeks, here are some things that work for idea generation:  The alphabet If you're part of a show based on a theme, this is really helpful. One theme I used this for was mustache. My group sat in a bar for two hours going through the alphabet free-associating words with mustache, spending five to ten minutes on words that began with each letter. Most of our ideas were unusable, but I think seven of our premises became sketches. Mustache cancer. Mustache carnival. Mustache Jason. All sketches from that session.   Shooting Shit For one of the groups I was in, I got most of my sketch ideas from listening to the other members as we shot the shit before meetings. When most people tell a story from their life, it's because something out of the ordinary happened to or near them. The teller may not even realize what's funny about the story--in fact, most people wouldn't realize I pulled a premise from their story until I told them where it came from.   The Newspaper Or whatever you use to get random information. One of my friends hits random on wikipedia until he finds something inspiring. As a group, sit down and look for (or come with) stuff you think is interesting and share it with the group, even if you don't have a take on it yet. Just like with stories, your description of something will often have a nugget of comedy, even if you don't realize it. That's why it's important to write with people who get you."

comedywriting,30u4dg,jimhodgson,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"The sketch group I work with does several meetings. At the first one, people bring ideas, everyone provides commentary. At the second one it's the same, but hopefully the ideas are a bit more developed.   Usually by this time it's getting close to time for the show pick, so everyone makes last minute changes, and the director picks whatever he/she likes best.   In big time writer's rooms, they'll go over every single joke in an episode and all try to top whatever they already have. Sadly, you're not likely to see that unless everyone's on some kind of salary."

As it stands, your set up is that the brothers are hard to tell apart, and then the punchline is that the brothers are hard to tell apart, one of those needs to change."

comedywriting,2zf9ys,MrIndianaJones,1 point,Wed Mar 18 07:46:37 2015 UTC,"To me, all of these need the punchline reworked to sell the concept.    For example, in 3... you tell us that you've put grass seeds in the cream. Ok. Then you tell us his head grew grass. Ok.  There's no surprise there. I mean it is silly because obviously grass seeds are not gonna grow on someone's head but it's not a punchline because you already told me you put grass seeds on his head. The logical conclusion of that story is that he grew grass on his head. There's no ""drop"", or surprise, or punch to make it a joke.            Perhaps if you took the conclusion futher... you could make the joke something about grass/weed and say 2 weeks later he got arrested going through security or something. Or, you put grass seeds in the cream and now he has worms in his ears. Or just say ""it didn't look great but he does attract a lot of great wildlife"" ,,, Or you put grass seeds in the cream and he has won some gardening competitions.   Or hide the fact that you put grass seeds in the cream until later. Allude to it somehow and then do a pull back and reveal that it was grass seeds.   I dunno, I'm not necessarily saying those are good punchlines but it needs some work.   I like the silliness/surreal thing in 4. It could definitely be tightened up though. Go through it and highlight the bits that are the punchlines, then work out how you can get to those bits in a stronger/clearer way."

He’s imaginary eyebrows furrow. His tail moves back and forth. He’s ready to pounce. He’s watching me…waiting for a mistake, a sign of weakness, a point of attack. His eyes burn deep into my soul, penetrating my very being and shaking my already fragile belief in God. God, why have you forsaken me?   All of this paints a picture but it doesn't have any punchlines/jokes.      If he could get cat food himself, I would be an immediate goner instead of an eventual goner.         ""if my cat could feed himself he'd murder me"" is an old concept of a joke       I know his kindness, his adoration, is part of his master plan to dominate the household. He rubs against my leg and meows. Damn, the cuteness! The affection! The feline charm! I must respond by petting him. I pet him so he doesn’t catch onto the fact that I know he has a secret plan to obliterate me and my family…and then the world.         The idea that perhaps you think your cat wants to kill you but actually he's just a lovely cat and you are just being paranoid and misreading him has potential, but you're not selling it.  You need to create dramatic irony, where you're saying stuff and telling the audience how you interpreted it,but somehow making it clear you are interpreting it wrong, for that idea to work.

The joke that you clean up your cats poop therefore are a slave to them is also an old one. The mafia message thing has potential, but you need to make it more of a thing. ""Even the mafia only sent horses heads, this cat leaves me literal piles of shit""    There are lots and lots of rambly short sentences here. It's like you are trying to paint a very vivid picture but that is rarely necessary in comedy.

They’re called, “fads.”  People wise up and abandon them once they realize that overindulging in anything is bad for you.  The more fashionable you are, the more ridiculous will seem from 10 years for now.  Did you really think that shoulder pads with persist?  Pretentious white wigs?  Crocs?  Really?  Aspartame and other false sugars are too good to be true.  For sure.  When I drink my aspartame-filled Diet Cherry Coke, I feel like my insides are melting away from the caustic chemicals.  I feel like I’m going to get cancer.  But I drink it anyway.  Hey, it’s diet.  And sweet.  It’s either gain 30lbs (happened to me—I drink a lot of Coke) when drinking pure Coke or having my insides destroyed by a diet drink.   But like I said before—Hey, it’s diet.  Stay away from rabid animals.  They will eat you.  This is kind of a dumb one.  If you meet a foaming-from-the-mouth raccoon, you generally have no interest in approaching one.  Sometimes cute animals are rabid.  This causes an internal battle where you weigh approaching the cute animal and perhaps helping it or staying the hell away so you don’t get rabies, too.  Drive a SUV.  In case of an accident, you will probably stay alive and annihilate the other car.  A lot of obnoxious people drive SUV’s, and ironically, like I said, they’re the ones that survive.  Oh, the irony.  Also, with an SUV, you have tons of space for your hypothetical sports adventure gear for your hypothetical sport adventures, and for driving through the elements, although you really mostly stay at home.  Eat carrots.  I don’t know why.  I just know that the worse it tastes the better it is for you, and I hate carrots.   I can’t even describe their taste.  The trick is to use them in small amounts, like in a salad or a stew or something, preferable when they no longer have that awful carrot taste.  Why do they have to have so much vitamin A?  It pisses me off.  I need vitamin A, but I don’t want to ever eat carrots.  I wish God had put vitamin A in things I do eat, like candy and lasagna.  This is mainly a guy thing, but don’t do anything that could possibly end in pain to the crotch.  This relates to a lot of bike and skateboard daredevils.  Or just people who ask their friends to kick them in the crotch because it’s somehow funny.  Just ask YouTube.  I’ve seen on America’s Got Talent a participant whose whole act was just how he could stand getting hit in the crotch multiple ways without totally losing it.  And people wonder why girls think guys are stupid.  Don’t break your hip.  This is how old people die.  They become bedridden, lose all muscle tone, and can barely sit up, let alone walk.  It’s the first step in an imminent death.  I know that sounds cynical.  I know.  Overeating.  Overeating initiates the slow course of embarrassment and difficulty getting up from the couch that makes one the butt of many mean jokes.  Being overweight in America is like giving the finger to the rest of the starving world.  When you’re overweight, people often wonder how you still survive.  (How can one lonely heart do so much pumping?)  Overeating is like a death wish.  I delicious, cheese cake, pizza, twizzlers, smoothie death wish.  Don’t kill someone in cold blood.  Obviously, killing someone in general is bad, but if you kill someone in cold blood, you’re more likely to get caught.  After all, while killing a person is bad, but being caught is horrendous!  The last thing you want is to be sentenced to death for killing someone you probably didn’t really want to kill in the first place.  You will probably think, “Huh.  Killing that person didn’t help my life very much.  It was a mistaken act of passion and knives.  My bad.”  Some serial killers need to learn this.  Nothing good comes from killing someone, even if you don’t like them very much and you want to kill them. Don’t kill yourself.  I can’t emphasize this enough.  Killing yourself will definitely put you on the fast track towards death.  Like du-uh.  You might as well tough it out because you might win the lottery.  If you buy a lottery ticket every week, your life may change awesomely when you win millions.  Slot machines, poker, roulette, etc.  It’s all good.    Well, there you go.  Hope that helps you stay alive.  Eat your vegetables. Drive safely.  Follow these tips, and you will hopefully make 55!"

Kinda confused me by the end - the ""hey, it's diet"" makes it sounds like you're saying to do diet over nondiet. ""This is kind of a dumb one"" doesn't need to be there! Not funny, takes up space, and there's nothing wrong with it being dumb, so no big. Dumb humor is fantastic, but if it says it's dumb, that kinda kills it. I feel like you could trim this one down to ""Stay away from rabid animals, even if they're cute."" If you're gonna have it longer than that, I'd add some more content. Short and sweet is nice too. The irony bit is kinda straying from your point and not really funny, but the hypothetical adventure stuff is nice. Keep it! This one kinda rambles. Might make more sense in a stand-up context, where it can flow from tangent to tangent like that, but as a written thing, it all runs together and loses me. Maybe pick one carrot angle and go hard. Definitely an improvement. If you wanna keep the butt joke, depending on the context, you could totally just italibolderline it or something. That third sentence is totally redundant. The hypothetical thought is great. Drop the duh! It actually is obvious. If you don't point it out, the fact that the author thought to mention it can be part of the joke. But if you do acknowledge it, it just misses the chance and deprives the reader of a chance to feel a tiny bit smart. I dig the lottery part."

For most people, not dying is a good thing to do, and most people enjoy not dying.  This is, however, without its obstacles.  Lots of things want to kill you.  Just because.  Like serial killers and stuff.  (Although serial killers are not mentioned in the list here because I forgot, and I can’t mention them now because I want the list to be exactly 10 long.)  So I will just discuss serial killers here.  Usually, it is good to not antagonize serial killers if you want to live longer.  Many times they don’t need to be antagonized to want to kill you, but hey, can’t hurt to be nice.  I also forgot about poison. (Dammit, maybe I should have rewritten this.)  Poison can kill you, too.  I learned this in safety town when I was 4.  Anyways…    Avoid fads.

If it's a shorter form video job I'll put together a three or four sketch packet that contains stuff that I think is a good mix of what I like to write, and what I think they want. I tend to lead with my most ""me"" thing to give whomever's reading it a good sense of what I'm about, followed by links to a small handful of videos I wrote that I think are well made, that have also done okay online. If you're including links, make sure they look professionally produced.  For ""literary"" jobs I'll include links to a few published articles. Maybe a few PDFS, stuff like that. Three things is a good rule here.  For more general jobs where people just want a sample of ""funny stuff"", I'll include a mix of those two things.  Usually for more ""joke writing"" jobs, a link to your twitter, or a page of monologue jokes is kind of the standard.  If it's an established brand, you'll have to put together a custom packet for them. Meaning you'll probably have to write a packet of new material that fit their brand.

I think you can describe it with wordsa dn that works fine, particularly since you've already talked about how it wouldnt look black. Words are more abstract from reality than pictures so i think they work better for describing concepts like nothing.  Also, look over some of your verb choices, e.g. ""the northern lights flagged out"". I know what you mean but i'm not sure flagging as a verb means what you think.

For example, even though the obelisk was supposed to be the ultimate void or pocket of nothingness, its blackness was already ruled out as something earlier in the story, and while it was apparently impossible to think about, the character was indeed examining, interacting with, and considering it, which requires it to be somewhere in his head.  At times I felt like I was reading an allegory about the author in the process of writing it. You could try to pursue that and make some kind of fancy meta-story that's really about itself, but it won't be comedy.   In general, the nothingness theme feels repetitive and can't really carry a whole story. Look for places to expand the narrative and give it more flavor. I think adding some dialogue will help with the pacing as well. And I think the typical reader wants to know why Tommy's last name was Goth.   On a much smaller note, your break from 3rd person with ""I'm not being facetious"" is not a good fit. Read Good Omens and pay careful attention to the interludes therein for good examples, but the point is that if you want to emphasize like that, stick to 3rd person and 2nd person imperative."
comedywriting,2y0o5u,robmox,2,Thu Mar 5 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the other commenters so far. I think a good premise is necessary. But it isn't what makes something funny, as you said. What makes something funny is the tension you add around the premise.   That said, you come up with good premises the same way you write good standup jokes or good songs or whatever. You think about it all the time, write notes, try stuff, keep going.   The more you do it the more easily it comes. Just like your mom.   Also keep in mind that most professional comedy writers are sitting in a room with other people they can develop shit with. Standups use lots of time working shit out in front of crowds to polish their work. It's a little unfair to hold yourself to their standard."
comedywriting,2y0o5u,jimhodgson,3,Wed Mar 11 21:54:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need an interesting premise to write good comedy. Think about some of the better sitcoms like Seinfeld, Community, Cheers, The Office, etc. None of them have interesting premises. They all have very mundane premises. The humor comes from the characters and the voices of the writers."
comedywriting,2y0o5u,vivadixiesubmarine,2,Thu Mar 5 17:32:52 2015 UTC,I'd agree with a this.  A premise can be absolutely anything. Some of the funniest sitcom episodes revolve around the most everyday mundane premises.

As far as I know they only people who are performing on the main stage and ETC are writing the show through improvisation throughout the process. Teachers also get paid as do tour cos.  I don't know of any positions to write and get paid without performing. The broad idea behind second city is that someone has a scene idea or premise and its improvised around again and again until its got its beats and is written down as a sketch.  If you want to write comedy you should absolutely be performing it in some form as well. Even if you suck you will get a better feel for what comedy is.
comedywriting,2xcut7,Taylor_OD,2,Fri Feb 27 23:32:09 2015 UTC,I was about to type that the sketch writing process at SC incorporates performing and editing while repeating the premise.

The fairly technical, formal language does a great job of minimizing the magnitude of everything that has ever lived dying (which I would consider a ""big deal"").   God is a particularly interesting character, immense in knowledge, but ultimately pretty bumbling and nervous. He has a great characterization, and I'm happy that you resisted describing his physicality (being in the ether and whatnot, that makes sense). I will say, I would like to be able to put a face to him, or at least a voice. Right now, he reads generically nervous. Universality may seem like a good idea for describing god, but I would be interested in seeing how his characterization would change if he had as much specificity to him as Fran does. One way I do this is to instantly think of who I would like to have play that character in a movie. By no means be tied down to it, but as a way to sort of color in the lines.   There are so many gems: the opening is beautiful in its brevity and levity; the fact that being ""publicly wrong"" about God is the worst thing to happen to atheists; the mere idea of life after life after death. I had some pretty good out loud laughs.   I'm excited to read more of this! It looks like it could go in many directions. I'm sort of hoping for a trial of some kind, with God as the judge and the trillions of things as defendants. I'm excited to learn frans significance (if significance is what you can call it).   I keep thinking how funny it is that your using an omniscient narrator to talk about God. I kind of hope that God is wrong in the end, just so there can be an explanation by the narrator about who actually was to blame.   Altogether, a great read! I really hope to read more!"

If so, I think you could execute that a lot more succinctly.  It feels to me like this whole sketch is possibly a platform for you to be able to refer to ""super aids cancer."""

comedywriting,2vusqs,SpeakeasyImprov,2,Tue Feb 17 13:19:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're halfway there—what you've got is a classic Inappropriate Response sketch. I would suggest restructuring a little bit to play around with how Opposite Day really makes everyone feel, and heightening Jim's exasperation (because as it stands, he reaches for that gun way too early). Let's see a few more examples of the Doctor giving opposite information, Jim reacting, the Doctor reminding him it's opposite day and trying to carry on with a standard doctor visit before Jim finally loses it.  You also have two options: I suggest making the reason for it being Opposite Day more internal to the Doctor, instead of making it a presidential decree. The Doctor could be childish or has some other reason he likes playing this game with people. Maybe he thinks it helps break bad news better? I dunno. OR, remember that almost everyone knows that it's Opposite Day except Jim, in which case Jim needs to really question everything that's been said to him today. The promotion, his wife saying she loves him forever that morning, etc. etc.  Good start though, keep writing!"

That's pretty funny. But you're taking 4 paragraphs to say that one thing, which is hurting you.   I think you should get right to that idea in paragraph one:   My children,  This quarter's reports are in and the results are not good. Despite divorce being, as you know, a sin, most of you are still ending your marriages. For this reason, we, the Church, now recommend you not only save yourselves for marriage, but save yourselves for your second marriage.    From there you could go on to a couple of ramifications thereof. Ways to avoid consummating marriage one. E.g. keep a pocket full of glitter and if your first wife tries to touch you, throw it and run. Or just begin wearing skinny jeans and Crocs. etc."

I definitely need the practice.  The twitter challenge is a weekly event in which people are encouraged to write/post jokes that fall within the twitter 140 character parameter. Basically, it's a weekly short joke competition. The reason we ask people to stick to 140 character limit is to ensure all the jokes are kept short. But we don't police this. You could post a 155 character joke and I wouldn't even know. I'd probably even laugh at it."

Other than that maybe find some scripts for shows you like so you can get an idea of how they write them and you can start on spec scripts.

In this publication, Campbell discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero found in world mythologies.  Since publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell's theory has been consciously applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. The best known is perhaps George Lucas, who has acknowledged a debt to Campbell regarding the stories of the Star Wars films.   The Joseph Campbell Foundation and New World Library issued a new edition of The Hero with a Thousand Faces in July 2008 as part of the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series of books, audio and video recordings. In 2011, Time placed the book in its list of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since the magazine was founded in 1923.

It's funny that these two women are gossiping about super heroes but  that can't be the only joke. I think it's interesting that they don't like Jenny but I don't think that adds anything to the sketch. Perhaps something about their relationship can add more comedy?   Why not throw in a twist? Maybe Thor is just a confused drunk? Maybe they're actually two fanboys discussing their favorite heroes? Something that takes the premise and twists it.   Anyway, good start. Good luck with it!"

Fat shaming? Vegan jokes? Maybe that's unfair, but the crossfit/vegan joke might have worked better if it was introduced as the old 'butter side up' conflict first, where one of your characters cued it up to be funny. Because you see that scene before they're talking about it, the punchline comes in too early.  I hope that's not too critical."

comedywriting,2t7occ,gunnarrambo,3,Wed Jan 21 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"Seconding the keep a notebook. I use evernote on my phone but whatever works for you. I add things to it when they occur to me, and try to add as much information as I can in the moment.   Every so often I go through that list, adding new thoughts as I go. Last I counted, I had more than 100 thoughts in that notebook.  When one of those ideas has 3 or 4 ok beats in it, and I'll actually start writing that sketch.  Here are some other ways. I don't often use them, but if you're in a bind they might be helpful.   Without thinking, write a list for each word of the alphabet in order. Then see if any of the words inspire you or if any of the word connections are funny or inspire you. Have a friend give you a word, and tell a story that that word makes you think of. You don't tell stories unless you find something about that story interesting. Whatever is interesting or funny about that story may make a good basis for a sketch.  When you're reading the newspaper (or more likely, reddit), take note of anything that seems off. A while ago there was a nurse who found out she had been diagnosed with Ebola via the news. So I wrote a sketch about a doctor who was incapable of delivering bad news face to face.  Pick a friend. Think of their traits. Is there anything you can exaggerate or are there any contradictions they hold? A friend of mine taught Philosophy. But he also delivered pizza. So I wrote a sketch about a pizza driver who spouted philosophy at his customers. It was terrible, but it serves as an example."

comedywriting,2s5kn9,harryhartounian,4,Mon Jan 12 10:54:33 2015 UTC,"In uni I think your best bet would be creative writing or screenwriting courses if you can find them. Outside of uni: seek out any sketch writing or improv class you can find, and jump in fearlessly. Writers groups too. There's only so much you can do at home. I'd highly recommend studying comedy somewhere if you can (I studied at Upright Citizens Brigade). If you can't, some people on here a while back posted Upright Citizens Brigade and Second City class notes, which would be a good start in the meantime.   Other than that: live a varied lifestyle, encounter situations outside your comfort zone on a daily basis, and make note of what works for you, or strikes you as funny (political humor, puns, sight gags...). Whenever you're in public, listen to the cadence of how people speak. Pay close attention to your influences - be they Richard Pryor, Will Ferrell or whomever - but realize they're not you. You can only be you, and only you know what works for you.   I cringe at the word networking, as I've lived in LA and know it often means shaking hands with people that just want to assess how you might be best utilized to their ends. But that's the name of the game. Make allies - and stay in touch. If you're not in a major city you can still cut your teeth - join writers groups or classes, online or in person - but once you become serious and want to make the leap, I'm afraid you'll probably need to relocate. When you do, my advice is to keep an eye on Craigslist. Search ""Gigs"" for 'film', 'movie', or 'production assistant' as often as you can, and work your way up. I've met many talented people in the industry by responding to ads and helping them out. You might not make much, or anything, at first, but the insight into the industry will be priceless. And if you scratch their back - they might be able to scratch yours down the line. Make contacts with people more knowledgeable than you - and don't let them go. It'll take time, and you'll need a source of income to support your typically pro bono efforts, but if you're competent and reliable, the karma will come back around.  I'm hearing back today about a dream job I recently interviewed for at a creative firm writing, developing and producing content. I think there's no chance I'll get it. But the only reason I got my foot in the door was because I've tried on a variety of hats (sketch/screenwriting, novel writing, stand up, filmmaking, app development...), and have, what I think, is my own unique take on things.   Best of luck!  tl;dr Step outside your comfort zone; join a group or take classes wherever possible; have a variety of influences and study them; know what works for you; and follow your heart, Littlefoot."
comedywriting,2s5kn9,harryhartounian,3,Mon Jan 12 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot thats a great help. However, i live in the uk and i think comedy classes are much more rare here. I'll have a look, but thinking it will be difficult to network here since where i am the comedy scene isnt as prominent. Have you ever written for anything that i could have heard of? Do you get many jobs justnow?"
comedywriting,2s5kn9,harryhartounian,1 point,Mon Jan 12 13:27:21 2015 UTC,"I would definitely search for the Second City and UCB notes posted on here then. It should be a great jumping off point if you've never taken classes. Once you get the notes, I'd suggest getting screenwriting software if you haven't already (Final Draft if you have money to burn; Celtx for free if you don't) and throw some sketches together. Maybe even transcribe some of your favorite sketches to better understand what they did that worked. At UCB we studied the Fortune Cookie sketch, which was pretty great. From that I learned about ""heightening"" and to start IN the action (no time for exposition in 5 minute sketches).   You wouldn't know any work I've done. I'm a nobody. I posted an excerpt from a book of mine a few weeks back that got some good attention on here, but other than that, no. I freelance as much as I can (worked for some guys from Pixar and the writer of ""Pay It Forward"" recently) and ask lots of questions to people in every film department when I can. That said: I've put in A LOT of time on my passion, and have seen essentially zero financial return. But I've never given up because I'm in it for the creativity; not $. Once you take a road less travelled like this, there's no real timeline. So remember why you're doing it (hopefully not Euros or fame), and know that it will take time. But never lose sight of how commendable it is what you're doing. Anyone can get a job in an office. Not everyone has the balls to say that's not for them, and to pursue what really makes them happy."

Maybe further display his ineptitude through a series of challenges he can't contribute to? (Maybe something like ""Fly after them Bee Boy!"" ""I can't.

There's some dramatic/historical irony in the Lincoln sketch where Abe being a bit of a slob and fan of Booth is funny, but not haha funny.  Jamaican therapy sketch kind of trades on the cultural stereotype of Jamaican people. The funny comes from the lack of professionalism juxtaposed against ""I think of suicide again"". Again, a good actor must sell this, or it might appear under-written.  Sean Connery speech therapy is an impression/cultural reference sketch that gets about as much mileage as the accuracy of the impression and the audience's knowledge of Sean Connery.  Lifeguard sketch is probably the best. It's a jab at Republicans that isn't obvious until the end and ends on an actual punchline.  Overall, impeccably written, not overtly funny, but slyly funny in the manner of some subtle, well performed character sketches. 7.5/10"
comedywriting,2s10xq,ApolloHelix,1 point,Sun Jan 11 13:07:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, really in depth commentary. That's awesome. Thank you. Are most ""successful"" sketches purely based in the setup-punchline style, or are most a combination of setup-punchline-humurous situation?"
comedywriting,2s10xq,jimhodgson,1 point,Tue Jan 13 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"Are most ""successful"" sketches purely based in the setup-punchline style, or are most a combination of setup-punchline-humurous situation?   I don't know. I just go with what I think is funny.  My favourite sketches have a twist in the form of a gag or revelation that turns the whole scene into a 'joke'. That's what I think your lifeguard sketch does with Republicans. These are the sketches that you can say ""The joke here is [x]. Someone has thought of a funny observation, and there it is played out.""  The other type, that I at least notice, is the ""isn't this a bit of a weird thing that is happening?"" sketch. Here, the funny comes from the absurdity of the scenario presented, and the humour between characters. These are character sketches. It's something that Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell (basically, the Groundlings) do a lot. You can't actually isolate a joke from these sketches, they are funny because the characters are charismatic and the situation they're in brings out their quirks. Which is why you need good actors that bring life to those roles, because you start to develop a sense of who they are and you laugh at them in the way that you laugh at your friends when they do something 'that is so them'.  Reminder: I have no authority on anything. I am speaking from intuition as a layman consumer of comedy.  Those two types of sketches exist on a spectrum. Your first two sketches are character sketches. Sean Connery already is a real person, and his sketch is a mix of both, with the joke being that Sean Connery should not be giving speech lessons. But it's funniest when you have a good Sean Connery impression. The lifeguard Republican is a good mix of both. The lifeguard is a bit off but there's a joke at the end that explains it.  The way I would punch up the first sketch, is if there were some fact about Abe Lincoln that made him clumsy with guns. Or if John Wilkes Booth was susceptible to flattery because of...  But that's just my favourite style of comedy. Character comedy on its own is perfectly legitimate and is the most fruitful to write. Jokes are stand-alone, inherently funny units of comedy. A funny character is a world of comedy to be explored. The challenge is to make a character inherently funny.  I hope this was helpful."

You can come up with funny ideas on your own usually if you write enough.   My best experiences writing comedy have been during performances. The stuff that just comes out sometimes is a lot of times really strong material. That's why open mic is good for so many people.

comedywriting,2rfkd5,Just_Joey,8,Mon Jan 5 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"General Rules   Keep it 3-5 pages for a stage sketch, 2-3 pages for a video. Focus on one unusual thing and heighten it. Initiate the unusual thing on the first page, if not on the first half of the first page. Watch all of Mr. Show and take notes. Key and Peele is another good example of contemporary quality sketch writing. While it covers improv, the UCB improv comedy manual is a good resource for sketch terms and general structure tips. Literally anything can be a sketch. Don't be too precious about your ideas or sit on something for too long. The premise of your sketch should be able to be summed up in one sentence. If you have to explain it beyond that one sentence for it to be funny, it's not a good premise.   Besides that, just dive in and do it dawg!  Edit : for formatting!"

comedywriting,2rfkd5,BSemisch,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:29:57 2015 UTC,Sure! PM me and we'll figure out the best way to do that.
comedywriting,2rfkd5,jimhodgson,2,Tue Jan 6 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"I found this sketch exercise somewhere:  1) Take a typical situation.  2)Identify 5 things that would normally happen.  3) Pick an unusual thing (not from the 5)   4) Apply the unusual thing to the list.  So say the setting is a guy going back to the gym to get in shape.  What happens? 1) He buys new gym clothes. 2) He tours a few different gyms. 3) he picks a gym 4) He tries to find a work out buddy 5) He researches diets.  Now let's pick an unusual thing. Maybe he's Nathan Explosion from the fictitious band DethKlok (From the TV show metalocolypse)   So he 1) Goes to buy new clothes, but only wants things that are all black, but can't find anything without logos on them. 2) He tours a few gyms and his darkness is juxtaposed by the happy tour guides, then maybe he finds a gym with a tour by a bored teenager who hates his job. 4) He tries to talk his band mates into going. Pickles gets too drunk, Squizgarr (I can't spell it) just hits on the geriatrics aerobics class, Toki is actually in really good shape and it makes Nathan depressed and Murderface sets off on a Heath at Every Size/body acceptance campaign. Then maybe Nathan meets with a dietitian and he goes vegan or something. I don't know.  That's just an example with an established character set, but you could easily see how that could work its way into an episode's worth of material. If you added could make the list in step 2 longer you'll be even better off and can generate more ideas, leading to better premises and possibly better jokes."

comedywriting,2r1siw,summerain92,3,Thu Jan 1 23:58:28 2015 UTC,"I can't answer your question specifically but I do want to throw out some perspective from someone who's older and at least a pro-am/PT comedy writer.  Whichever city you pick it's very unlikely you'll be able to go straight from university to getting a FT paid job to write comedy. If you need to bring in income it's very likely you'll be doing some other kind of job until you get a break, so (esp if you're pursuing a liberal arts degree) that could range anywhere from working at a restaurant or as an office clerk, who knows. Meanwhile, regardless, nothing prevents you from sitting down and writing original comedy work any time you're free and have the inspiration or drive to do it. You can then share that on the web wherever, or self-publish, try to monetize or get pieces bought. But just as its never been easier for writers to get their stuff out there, it's prob gotten harder in other ways. But it can now be easier to have your work discovered if it's truly great and goes viral. That can open doors. However writing is one craft you can do anywhere and doesn't matter where you live, as long as you have Internet. Yes it seems you may increase your odds of landing an ""office job"" writing comedy if you're in NY or LA, etc, however the folks making the hiring/spending decisions can now discover and draw from this big global location-irrelevant pool of comedy writers, including all the most talented amateurs. So I guess what I'm saying is that my sense is you'll see a bigger boost to your chances of becoming a paid professional at this by simply becoming the best you can, let the public/market vote, and get discovered by the folks in the position to hire, using all the Internet channels you have avail.  Take this perspective with a grain of salt. There may be others who can give more concrete input on NY vs LA specifically.

Using eggs as an allusion to currency was kind of a bizarre turn, but in my experience I find that the bizarre can actually strengthen any points (in a satirical piece, at least) that might be present.  The baby to egg-debt ratio was a reference to the oft-quoted factoid that each American baby born today is also born with ~$13,000 worth of debt.

There's a very easy way to tell if you have talent - I can assure you with 100% certainty that you don't. Talent is something you earn from deliberate practice and completed projects.  Write because you enjoy it and it makes you feel something. Time you enjoy spending is never wasted. Go write, if you like it then you'll stick with it. If you stick with it and work on it, eventually you'll get somewhere with it.  For now, just go to /r/writingprompts and bang out a prompt or two everyday.

People, especially dickholes on the internet, will try to tell you you're not funny every day.   If you've heard the laughs, you know it's bullshit. CorvetteGuy69xx -- or whatever his anonymous name is -- might not be laughing, but that's his problem.   As far as getting your work seen, if you just write one project and that's it, it is hard.
