cockatiel,3e3run,BriBarber4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:51 2015 UTC,No problem! They love nutri-berries and pellet berries. Made try some different flavors of the nutri berries. :)
cockatiel,3e3run,painesgrey,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"Is this what you're using?  I use Roudybush Daily Maintenance and Zupreem (Avian Entre√©s) pellets, coupled with Avicakes, Nutriberries, and fresh fruits and veggies for variety.   In general, you can't go wrong with diets from Roudybush, Zupreem, Harrison's, or Lafeber's. It really all depends on what your bird likes and doesn't like."
cockatiel,3e3run,theySEEmeTROLL1N,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:22 2015 UTC,It looks like that but is Blue and White.  Very similar though.  I'll go for the Zupreem then.  Thanks!
cockatiel,3e3run,birdetta,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"I use roudybush's daily maintenance, I think the size is mini... They're shaped like short skinny noodles.  Pumpkin also eats fresh fruits, veggies, meat and eggs."

I give it to him in a 3:2:1 ratio (zupreem, roudybush, seed). He also gets the lizards kale and fruit when he feels like it (he only eats fruit if im eating it too)"
cockatiel,3e0uon,Bricktastic,4,Tue Jul 21 02:22:11 2015 UTC,He seems to like when I tap on things and then joins me in tapping. Anyone know exactly why he likes to tap his beak? I read a few theories that it's a mating thing and another that says he's letting me know that whatever he's tapping is his.
cockatiel,3e0uon,sh4mmat,4,Tue Jul 21 02:23:37 2015 UTC,It's a dominance thing. Anything he rattles is his.

cockatiel,3e2u6t,pizzalldayeveryday,3,Tue Jul 21 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"That's so sweet of you, one can see that you really care about Vivian's well-being.   That being said, having the bird out unsupervised could be very dangerous, even though you have good intentions. No matter how well they know the environment, they can always get startled and fly against something or get stuck in some tight space. But I'm assuming you mean a normal living space, if the room is absolutely bird-proofed (i.e. the whole room made to be some kind of aviary) then go for it.  I would just leave her in the cage a couple days. She will be fine, ill birds at the vet are treated the same way. And it's the safest way."
cockatiel,3e2u6t,yayachiken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response - I've had her for 11 years so her wellbeing is important to me! And it's definitely not an aviary - just a normal apartment. Haha.
cockatiel,3e2u6t,dayvancowgirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:43 2015 UTC,ill birds at the vet are treated the same way   Good point! You can just give her a lot of exercise when you get back.
cockatiel,3e2u6t,dayvancowgirl,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:47 2015 UTC,"That is tough. Is it that the neighbor isn't comfortable handling her to take her out? Could she use a perch or dowel to do that and just hang out in the room with her for a bit?  Unless the room is like 10000% tiel-proofed it seems risky to leave it open (like for example, an unfurnished room might be best, but even then, the tiel might chew on the window frame or baseboard or something. I know mine would, anyway)."
cockatiel,3e2u6t,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know :/ Even if I left her out, I would still have the neighbor come check in. Still makes me nervous though. I would bird proof the room to the best of my ability but you're right, you just never know. It's not that the neighbor wouldn't be comfortable, it's that Vivian wouldn't be. She's gotten very nervous and a little grumpy in her old age."
cockatiel,3e2u6t,twolips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm going to have to agree with the majority of people in that letting her roam free is just too dangerous to risk. Five days sitting safe in her cage is much better than the countless potential accidents that could occur if she is left unsupervised. And it would help you keep your peace of mind as well.  If I were in your shoes (not trusting that she will cooperate with the neighbor) I would make sure her cage has been rearranged and stocked with new/fun toys right before you leave. I would put in a foraging activity or two, and make a bunch of extras so your neighbor can add fresh ones and remove the old ones each day. An easy example is simply putting some treats in a small, empty food cup, filling the rest of the bowl with shredded paper, then taping a piece of paper with some holes cut in it over the top. I leave some of these bowls pre-made for my bf when I have to work all day, and they keep the birds busy for a while. You just have to make sure your bird knows that their is food in their. Finally, you could leave a radio playing softly so she isn't disconcerted by the quiet of the apartment.  Overall, five days without a ton of exercise is not going to harm your bird, so might as well be safe than sorry."
cockatiel,3e2u6t,Knall0r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:13 2015 UTC,All of those are awesome ideas! She's due for a cage renovation anyways. Haha. And the radio idea is a good one too. Plus I think my neighbor is agreeing to spend a half hour a day in the room with her.
cockatiel,3e2u6t,Knall0r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"I place my tiels in boarding whenever I'm away for more than two days. Lots of cities have avian vet offices who offer boarding. It's great peace of mind because they keep a good eye on the birds, offers fresh food and water daily, and will provide care in case of emergency. The place I use also gives them time outside of the cage. I personally don't have friends who are bird owners so I don't really trust them to handle my birds. And I would definitely not let the birds wander my apartment unsupervised. Who knows what could happen."
cockatiel,3e1nov,Darkheart91,2,Tue Jul 21 07:11:57 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in investing some time to get them, one of the things we do with birds at where I work is put some food on the floor or table, something they really want. Then we put parchment paper or canvas surrounding it on all sides and then a ring of your desired paint choice on the edges of that, something they'd have to step into.  I'm sure you get where this is going, but they would theoretically, walk through the paint because oooh millet and then walk over the canvas. I say it might take a while because if your tiel is like mine the canvas and paint will be like the literal worst thing ever from the pits of hell and they'll stick clear of it. But with a little bit of work you could have your prints I think. Obviously you'd use non-toxic paint and you might want to clean their little feetsies afterward if you don't trust them to do it themselves."
cockatiel,3e1nov,Tyega,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:51:14 2015 UTC,thanks a lot! It was an idea I was considering :)
cockatiel,3e1nov,budgiefacedkiller,2,Tue Jul 21 08:59:22 2015 UTC,A good non-toxic dye you can use is food coloring. Safe for their feet and you technically don't need to worry about washing it off later (I know my birds would make a fuss if I tried to).
cockatiel,3dx7kx,TheStig30,10,Mon Jul 20 07:40:13 2015 UTC,"I found my overalls and climbed under the house to rescue him. He came straight to me and when I came inside he happily say on my shoulder. We borrowed a cage from a friend and got him some seed, he's happy in a cage or happy to sit on our shoulder. He's very tame and likes pats from our girls and loves his neck scratched. He doesn't appear injured and has been eating very well since we had him. My wife has posted on Facebook that he was found and also we are searching local papers and looking for lost pet flyers. He is very tame so I hope we find his owner. If we can't, we are happy to keep him, however and my girls enjoy having him around. I will make a perch for him shortly, and I think he will need a bath soon. Anyway, meet George. Or Georgie, depending on sex!"
cockatiel,3dx7kx,Falkner09,3,Mon Jul 20 07:47:48 2015 UTC,"find a local avian vet and have him checked for a microchipped. Most people don't know that tiels can be chipped, but they can and sometimes are. especially if he's as friendly as you say, he must belong to someone who might have cared enough to take him to a vet for this."
cockatiel,3dx7kx,VocePoetica,3,Mon Jul 20 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"The closest avian vet to me is about 2 1/2 hours away, the next is nearly 6. I've never heard of a bird being microchipped to be honest. Typically they put rings on their legs and that was the first thing I checked. We've been checking local papers and Facebook pages but I'll check with our local vet today and see if they can check for microchips in birds."
cockatiel,3dx7kx,myaussiefriends,5,Mon Jul 20 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"If they exist in your area call ASPCA or the humane society. My friends cockatiel got out and those were the first places she called. Also, check with local pet stores and pet rescues. Losing one of my girlies would absolutely destroy me so please be as thorough as you can be. Plus she'll be worried and stressed without her flick if she is that tame. My bird recognizes me through the phone and gets very worried and upset if either me or my husband go on trips."

cockatiel,3dipwr,PirateMadie,2,Thu Jul 16 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time imagining the pose, but it sounds a little bit like when my female cockatiel would, ahem, present herself. She would lay her tummy flat on the ground, cock her tail up, and then make this high pitched noise that was almost like a broken whistle. Then she would get over it and go back to doing whatever."
cockatiel,3dipwr,plethomacademia,2,Thu Jul 16 16:41:35 2015 UTC,That sounds pretty appropriate actually! We figured it was a mating ritual but we never knew if it was a male or female thing
cockatiel,3dipwr,plethomacademia,3,Thu Jul 16 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I can at least verify that my lady would do this fairly regularly and did so up until the day that she died. We learned through this that she finds certain podcasters' voices to be extremely attractive.   EDIT: My bf read through this and reminded me that the mirror might be causing this, since it might make her think there's a sexy cockatiel there. If this becomes an issue, like she starts laying, you might want to remove it. Otherwise, it's just something to make fun of her for."

cockatiel,3dipwr,DemonDigits,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:54:03 2015 UTC,My female does this exact pose too. Be careful of touching or petting below the neck or giving her medium to build a nest. Cockatiels are known chronic egg layers.
cockatiel,3dg9oi,skeptic26,3,Thu Jul 16 01:07:01 2015 UTC,"All juvenile cockatiels have the typical markers for identifying female cockatiels: greyed head, barring on their tail feathers, and spots on their wing feathers.   The males lose these markers and develop a brighter yellow head once they get their adult plumage.   At a year old, it is more than likely your cockatiel has adult plumage and is, therefore, is probably female. Only a DNA test will say for certain, though."
cockatiel,3dg9oi,painesgrey,2,Thu Jul 16 01:15:19 2015 UTC,"If this little ""guy"" is a year old, he might just be a she. It's not 100% obviously because there's no true way to tell without DNA testing. But it's got female coloring.  Does he/she talk at all? Whistle or anything?"
cockatiel,3dg9oi,ZeeFishy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:53:45 2015 UTC,"if he's standard color, generally the darker they are/the more grey they have, the more likely they are to be female... i believe. Female 'tiels also have bars under their tails, which can be hard to see sometimes depending on the color..   Like /u/painesgrey says, these are also things that young 'tiels have too so if you're sure that the feather loss is form a moult and not some other factor like abuse from another bird or self mutilation, which could both be very possible in a rescue bird, and you're sure of his/her age, then its most likely that you have a lil girl with you!!  Remember also that female 'tiels rarely mimic words or tunes."
cockatiel,3dfy27,DemonDigits,4,Wed Jul 15 23:31:09 2015 UTC,"Mine is old, but I still keep them strictly apart.  Usually I split their time half-and-half.  So, like...half the time my 'tiel will only be allowed out in my room and my cat will get the rest of the house, then the other half of the time, my 'tiel will get run of the house and my cat will be locked in my room.    When my 'tiel is in his cage, though, they're able to see each other and 'interact' as she can't reach his cage.  My rule of thumb is to not take chances, you never know when instinct will kick in."
cockatiel,3dfy27,Malted_Shark,3,Thu Jul 16 02:19:01 2015 UTC,I lost a bird when I tried to adopt a kitten. It's not worth the risk. I'd really try to avoid it at all costs.
cockatiel,3dfy27,hugitoutguys,3,Thu Jul 16 03:31:20 2015 UTC,"I have a Cherry Headed Conure, a Sun Conure and two Cockatiels in addition to my two cats. All birds are flighted. We keep our birds in their own room where they can roam freely and if we allow them to perch in any other area of the house--we place the cats in the bedroom for that period of time. I have to be really attentive when going in and out to ensure that i shut the door completely and the cats arent trying to slip in. (If i just have one conure on my shoulder--i can walk around and do chores without the cat becoming too interested) It's important to us that they all get a chance to explore the house at some point during the day. It's just something you have to get use to and be careful about. Definitely possible."
cockatiel,3dfy27,Talllkitten,2,Thu Jul 16 04:03:47 2015 UTC,"Two cats, four cockatiels. I have absolute rule over all 6. My cats were trained to stop what they're doing and look at me when I make a ""tss"" sound. Faster if I hiss. They were introduced to my cockatiels slowly and in my presence. Any time they approached, they would get tss'ed or hissed at. Now the cats aren't interested in them, even when they fly around the room.  I still put the cockatiels away when I leave my tiny house. They're idiots, so I don't trust them not to fall on the ground and bug the cats.   My conures, however, terrify my cats. The conures will attack (read: chase) the cats if they are within 5 feet of them. Once, the cat looked away for a split second while laying next to the conure and the conure latched on to the cat's paw and scared the shit out of the cat (the cat was not injured). They stopped sniffing around the conures after that day. One cat was always an indoor, one was feral until about 7 months of age. I have seen less interest in the birds from the feral cat, surprisingly enough.  I also cut my cat's nails and while I was introducing the birds I put on the cat claw covers.   Every scenario is different and you should never assume they will get along. My cockatiels don't stay out while I'm out just in case and the conures don't stay out because they fuck with my stuff when I'm not around. Essentially: don't leave your birds out when you aren't around."
cockatiel,3dfy27,bbbbirdistheword,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:25:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on the cat but the ones I've had are pretty uninterested in the bird unless he's flying around, and even then it's more curiosity than hunting since I keep their wings trimmed and it's been an unusual circumstance that they fly from the cage. I had a cat that enjoyed lounging on top of the cage because it looked out to the backyard, completely oblivious to the bird inside, and he got used to it too eventually. I had another cat that would walk on the cage side rails and eye the bird, but that only lasted a few weeks. Again, it depends on the cat."
cockatiel,3dfy27,Kaggr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:39:04 2015 UTC,"When I first got the cat, I introduced them slowly using a spray bottle if my cat got a little too interested in my fluffy bird. My cat doesn't usually care about the bird, as long as it's in its cage. If my cockatiel is in its cage, they can share a room happily as long as I'm there supervising. If my cockatiel is out of its cage, the door is shut or the cat is outside. But they can coexist. Just make sure your cockatiel gets enough attention, sometimes it's hard to juggle if both have to be separate. Good luck."

cockatiel,3dfy27,Razlyk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"The cat moved in a little over two years ago along with my boyfriend, and I was very nervous about what would happen, knowing the cat loves to watch outside birds and gets very excited.  At the time, I had a quiet older female tiel (passed away last winter from natural causes, 21 years old) and I still have Rocky (11 year old active and vocal male).  I did a lot of reading and decided to always keep them separated - as /u/Malted_Shark says - you never know when instinct will kick in.  Cat has run of the house while we're at work all day and the bird stays in the cage - the cat doesn't bother Rocky in the cage at all.  When I get home and if Rocky is being a good boy, I will lock up the cat with her box / food / water, and let Rocky have the run of the house for a few hours.  They are never both out at the same time.  One thing we tried was where someone holds the cat, and someone holds the bird, and you force the bird to bite the cat on the cat's nose.  Cat's noses are very sensitive, so it'll hurt and scare the cat - hopefully making the cat less interested in the bird.  I'm not sure if it was because of this, but the cat is not interested in the caged birds at ALL.  She prefers to watch the outside birds, and leaves Rockybird alone."
cockatiel,3dfy27,diadexus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"I have two 'tiels and I just moved into an apartment with a roommate who has a cat. It depends on the personality of the cat if you're comfortable having the birds in their cages accessable to the cat. My parent's cat is so passive he never even cared. This new cat, though, is super insane. I never let him in my room where I keep the cages. And if I do, I am watching and paying attention with spray bottle in hand. That being said, I only moved in at the beginning of this month, so more time will tell if I can let them interact more, or worry less about always shutting my door behind me."
cockatiel,3dfy27,avantegarde-n,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems like I just have to hope it's a passive cat and keep a spray bottle near the cage. I don't intend to ever let my girl out in the same room as the cat . . . as much as I trust my dogs with her, I don't think it's in me to trust a cat, no matter the circumstances. But I'm also not willing to keep her in any room other than the main one, so I guess I just have to position the cage away from any furniture so the cat can't paw at it."
cockatiel,3dfy27,myaussiefriends,0,Sat Jul 18 19:41:07 2015 UTC,Keep them apart. Separate rooms. Cats can move a lot faster than you can and WILL kill your cockatiel.
cockatiel,3de3cy,AcePropertiesyo,5,Wed Jul 15 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty decent rundown.  A non-socialized cockatiel will usually hiss and bite, yes.  He doesn't know you're not dangerous yet.  I'd suggest doing something quiet like reading in the room with him.  Open his cage, let him explore, but essentially ignore him.  Don't stare at him.  If he flock calls, respond, but otherwise leave him.  Over time, he'll come to you.  You can have a treat open in your palm, or even just near you, but don't approach him with it.  Let him decide when he's ready to get it.  It might take awhile!  Some cockatiels are more skittish than others."
cockatiel,3de3cy,vaqari,3,Wed Jul 15 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"Just as a reference, a week is nothing at all when talking about the time it might take to tame a bird. Take a look over at /r/parrots for more example of people spending months or even  years taming untamed birds.   vaqari gave you a link to a good resource. I would also recommend simply googling ""how to tame a new bird/parrot"". There are many experts/forums/articles online with tips on how to befriend your new bird.   Another useful tool can be clicker training. It uses positive reinforcement to communicate and bond with your bird. Amazon has a great book ""Getting Started: Clicker Training for Birds"" that can give you all of the info you need to utilize clicker training effectively.   Finally, the last thing you need to do is gather every last shred of patience you have, multiply it by 5, and accept the fact that this may be a painfully slow process. The good news is, if you make sure to only have positive interactions, and never force your bird to move more quickly than it wants to, you can end up with a fantastic bird companion."
cockatiel,3de3cy,budgiefacedkiller,3,Wed Jul 15 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"It's sad to hear that a ten week old cockatiel which came from a breeder isn't tame.   But! Hissing is normal for a scared little baby in a new environment. Give it time, spend lots of time being near it, talk to it and work your way up by attempting to feed it little treats and such with your hands. Eventually, it will get used to being near you. A week is not nearly long enough for the little one to adjust."
cockatiel,3de3cy,ZeeFishy,3,Thu Jul 16 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"A tip for you. Since everyone has covered most of it.   Cockatiels are highly social and they eat as a flock in the wild. When you give him treats,  try placing them in the food disk and then eat some yourself. Make happy noises, give him a good view of you nomming it, talk about how it tastes. Normally the older members of his flock would have introduced him to the less common foods.  Now that's your job.  If he doesn't eat the treat,  just keep trying. If he starts to eat seed while you eat food,  it a subtle sign that he considers you 'flock'. And it's a good thing.   Best of luck."

cockatiel,3d7vfs,thelazerbeast,2,Tue Jul 14 06:07:41 2015 UTC,So sweet! I love when they are comfy and so so sleepy!
cockatiel,3d555w,TheHamburgerlar,2,Mon Jul 13 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"Hiya! Glad you are having fun with your new friend. I try to answer as best I can.   Bathing/showing - If I knew the secret to this I would be very happy. My birdy is a messy cow who avoids water too. A few things I have tried with mixed success is leaving a large bowl of shallow water out and leave them to investigate themselves, bringing them into the shower while I am there, leaving a tap running and see if they check up on it.  Your birdy will go where he pleases to be honest. He probably wont go and stay on the floor or other surfaces because he is still getting used to his new home. Cockatiels a naturally curious and he will eventually want to investigate new places when he is comfortable he is safe there.  I am strongly against wing clipping. I have never clipped my bird and I have problem controlling her. I have insect netting stuck over open windows to prevent her escaping and other than that she has free flight of my home and is has grown use to the rooms enough to not crash into anything. Any music or noises is good noise, I don't think there is anything specific they like or dislike. If you want to train them to sing something then I believe repetition is the key but I cannot tell you for sure cause mine is female and doesn't sing anything trained.    Hope this helps!"
cockatiel,3d555w,diggory_x,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:30:52 2015 UTC,Very much so. Thanks! I guess it's just tough for me to understand the birds train of thought. Especially when I see videos of Cockatiels loving baths and walking around the floor and stuff.   Glad to hear that there are other non-wing clippers here on Reddit! I think putting up nets on the windows might be a good idea more so he doesn't crash into the Window blinds
cockatiel,3d555w,diggory_x,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"'Tiels can figure out windows. Again, it is probably just your one not being fully comfortable with his new home yet. If he is hand tame, try bringing him close to a window so he can see out and it realise he cannot get through, that's what I did with mine. She now happy sits near the window and yells at passing pigeons."
cockatiel,3d555w,penguinpaige,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:13 2015 UTC,I'm just picturing it!! So cuteeeeee. Did you get your Tiel handfed? I might get a second one companion but that might complicate things.
cockatiel,3d555w,LemonMagician,2,Mon Jul 13 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Bath: I never could get mine to bathe. Unless I was holding a cup of water. THEN she's hop into the too tall glass and try to take a bath. She's spread her wings and try to dip into the cup like an idiot. So I just let her play in my glass and try to spritz her with water from the cup until I was damp and she was soggy. :-)  Floors: Floors are tricky cause depending on the foot traffic and how much stuff you have that would impede their sight they might not want to get on the floor at all. It just doesn't feel safe for them. It might just take time. Eventually, if I stayed in the other room too long, my tiel would fly to the floor, walk down the hallway, then fly up on the bed to perch on my shoulder. I was pretty damn impressed she did that, but it was a one bedroom apartment and she was comfortable with the layout.   Clipping: I like the idea of clipping new birds at first. I think it makes them easier to control and builds a stronger bond since they'll require more hand-traveling from cage to shoulder to couch, etc. Just make sure they return to the cage frequently enough for water/snack breaks. And since the feathers grow back gradually, the independence grows too. Once I was comfortable with my new tiel's flying ability, I would open the cage door in the morning and she would fly out to see me, hang out on the couch, fly to the table to chew everything, and fly back to her cage for a nap/snack. I liked that kind of independence. Of course, I was always home and around in case she flew into trouble. LIKE LANDING IN A PAPER BAG AND GETTING STUCK. I swear. These birds. I love them."

He complains, partly because I also take the opportunity to steal kisses.  But if I loose track of time and don't yank him out, he complains even more vigorously."
cockatiel,3cxm2u,30cuts,4,Sat Jul 11 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"Mine does something similar! I made him his own little bird house, with a door and everything.

cockatiel,3cxm2u,oesim,3,Sun Jul 12 03:06:11 2015 UTC,"hehe he's so attached to me, sometimes when chilling on the couch or in my bed i'll pick him up and move him about an arm's length away, and he'll immediately come running back. the amazing cockatiel boomerang!  sometimes when i come home from work or when i go to cover him at night, as i'm starting to make my way over to his cage i'll see him go down to the bottom of it (i like to call it his ""work area"" because that's where all his shredding takes place, with the toys and paper), and to me it always seems like he's trying to either pretend he was doing something busy instead of just waiting around for me to see to him...or maybe he wants to show me all the work he accomplished that day haha. sometimes he'll come back up for good night kisses but sometimes he'll just stay down at the bottom as i cover him (eventually he'll go up to his sleeping spot on his own). the old (like, from the 80s) blue/grey/white towel that is used to cover him is sort of like his ""blankie"" and he chirps kisses when he gets tucked in sometimes. such a cutie :)"
cockatiel,3cxm2u,NewayZ,3,Sun Jul 12 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"oh and sort of related, i always found it interesting that he's very aware of when he's on part of my body. if i set him on the bed by himself for example he won't like it, but if i'm lying in bed under the blankets he'll know when he climbs on even my covered leg or something like that that he's back on me and safe. guess it has to do with body heat?"
cockatiel,3cxm2u,petrichorion,2,Sun Jul 12 02:31:55 2015 UTC,"That's really sweet! I'm not sure what's more adorable, your cockatiel or how you describe and interpret it. :)  Mine likes to snuggle up under my chin a lot. I'll be sitting and watching TV, and he'll come right up and make himself comfy. I think he likes the secure and warm feeling of being next to their owner, almost like they are in a nest or something."
cockatiel,3cxm2u,Tyega,3,Sun Jul 12 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"I can't get him to dance when I'm watching, however, whenever he thinks I can't see him (example, if he's on my head), he'll dance if I play music. So I've resolved to sitting across from a mirror and then playing music. No dancing when he's on my finger or a perch. Put him on my head? Good luck getting him to stop."
cockatiel,3cxm2u,Tyega,2,Sun Jul 12 05:19:38 2015 UTC,"That's adorable! Does he like bob his head to the music? My guy has done that a few times, not sure he likes being watched either!"
cockatiel,3cxm2u,lazyass123,3,Sun Jul 12 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah!! He does it on and off like he'll do it a little bit, and then stop, but he'll do that until the song ends. I definitely wish he would actually dance while I watch though."
cockatiel,3cxm2u,arttimo,3,Sun Jul 12 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"Max woofs sometimes. He heard a dog in the last house we lived in.  Also, my wife has a bag that she keeps misc. stuff for the living room in. He imitates the zipper noise of that bag whenever she opens it.   And then he talks to the paper in his cage. He will pull it up, talk to it, then when it falls back down, he will do it again.  He's a bit of a weirdo. :)"

cockatiel,3cuhz3,Misspissyoants,2,Fri Jul 10 21:51:23 2015 UTC,Thank you! It is indeed a Canadian maple. He gets about one a summer for the past twelve years but I will do some reading up :-)
cockatiel,3cuhz3,painesgrey,3,Sat Jul 11 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"I can't quite tell from the picture, but be wary if that's maple. The bark can harbor fungus that can be harmful. Without the bark, it should be fine."
cockatiel,3cuhz3,Nezumify,2,Sat Jul 11 00:05:21 2015 UTC,It's a maple of some sort. No other tree has star-shaped leaves. Is it all maples that carry it? Maple species differ by area.
cockatiel,3cuhz3,painesgrey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:10:27 2015 UTC,I think it's only red maples that have the chance of harboring the fungus.

cockatiel,3ctdqg,Tuxx115,15,Fri Jul 10 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"I think it means he doesnt want to leave, my cockatiel does the same thing. I feel like cockatiels have short memories anyway, if they are hissing and annoyed at something 15 seconds later they forget about it and become happy again"
cockatiel,3ctdqg,jackpfree,4,Fri Jul 10 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"Mine does the same thing. It's because he knows I'm about to put him on his house and he would rather stay with me.   We have had him for about 6 years, he was a rescue so his age is unknown,  and try as I might I have not been able to change this behavior. If I'm persistent and keep advancing my finger he will eventually get on. Sometimes he nips but never hard enough to be painful.   At this point in his life I just accept this. I have tried every training method I know. He knows not to bite too hard so i don't worry about it anymore."
cockatiel,3ctdqg,mangotango1609,5,Fri Jul 10 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"He doesn't want to get off your shoulder.  Likely he's figured out that biting allows him to stay on your shoulder longer.  Making getting off your shoulder something good can help.  Give him a special treat as soon as he steps up or whenever he leaves your shoulder.  Maybe switch to using a perch to get him off for a while, so you don't get all bit up.  When he gets slightly better at stepping up, you can go back and forth--have him step up, give him a treat, and allow him back on your shoulder."
cockatiel,3ctdqg,vaqari,3,Fri Jul 10 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"Thing is, he doesn't bite hard. I think it's just his way of saying no, not that he wants to hurt me but I'm not sure :/"
cockatiel,3ctdqg,vaqari,5,Fri Jul 10 17:41:12 2015 UTC,"If he's just nipping or ""beaking"", he's definitely trying to say no.  I'd suggest getting him to step up, giving a treat, and putting him back on your shoulder.  He'll learn good things happen when he steps up off your shoulder, and that being asked to step up off your shoulder doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't get to be on your shoulder anymore.  He probably likes you a great deal and doesn't like being told to leave you.  One of my boys does something similar at bed time.  Sometimes he'll try to bite when going back to his cage because he doesn't want play time to be over.  Making going back to his cage a positive experience and sometimes sticking around for a half hour after he's been put to bed have helped."
cockatiel,3ctdqg,Misspissyoants,3,Fri Jul 10 17:55:16 2015 UTC,My tiel does this also. Pretty sure he just wants me to remember who is bossüòÄ
cockatiel,3ctdqg,hugitoutguys,3,Fri Jul 10 19:14:58 2015 UTC,Don't worry. He's comfy sitting with you and doesn't want to get down! He's just being fussy.
cockatiel,3ctdqg,narufry,2,Sat Jul 11 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"It's possible that even though he's tame he doesn't feel completely safe around hands or doesnt like the angle that your hand comes from when you reach out to him on your shoulder. We have a tiel that the friendliest lil think, loves head scratches, will be held any way, but if you approach her at the wrong angle with your hand she'll get all hissy and bitey. It might also be that he just doesn't want to get down from your shoulder.  if it's a problem of the hand approaching the wrong way I suggest you try a slower approach and give him time to get fully used to it. If he's just being a monkey and doesnt want to come down you just have to be stern and ignore him little hissy fit. You could also avoid putting him on your shoulder in the first place, some people say it's not so good as it places the bird in an area of dominance over you. that might also have something to do with it. If he's fine in all other circumstances it's probably okay to just ignore it and give him time to either get used to your hand, or realize that he's not the boss."
cockatiel,3cr6rz,engpaliasch,2,Fri Jul 10 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"Haha, if he's preening he'll share his birdie dandruff with you.  My birds used to chill on my shoulder and do that to me... dusty little puff balls."

cockatiel,3cp77j,FrostedGlassLion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:38:42 2015 UTC,Lutino cockatiels have a bald head under their crest that is normal if that is the area you are talking about. Their cage does not look like it is suitable for them. First it appears to be circular. They do not like circulare cages. It also looks like it might have zinc which is toxic to birds. When you adopt them I would take them to a vet to check for zinc toxicity for one and a check up in general. Read up on cockatiel ownership because it is both rewarding and takes time and effort. It is a commitment. this site has a lot of info re. cockatiels. http://www.cockatielcottage.net/    Also when looking for a cage this site gives some info about cages you want to be sure they are zinc free and have the proper spacing between bars: http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?pcatid=16472&rel=1  They also need different size natural perches for the health of their feet.  Good luck and keep us posted!
cockatiel,3cp77j,lotuslane,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:11:49 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the info! I'm going to try to read as much as I can and totally get that linked cage once I commit to the adopt.

cockatiel,3cmvsk,Monkeyninja24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"There is a way to tell a white tiels gender physicslly. OP you have a male. White faced tiels will have pure white faces if males -grey and darker colored faces if female. Also, the tail and wings, if they are a solid color, grey, white, whatever, then it is a male. If there are different colors, bars of sorts, on the tail either like stripes going down the tail/inside of the wings or pokadotted then it is a female. You can be 100% sure on this after they go through their first heavy molt, lose their tail feathers etc. You only need a DNA sexing if the tiel is younger than 6 months old. You cannot tell, even though all of these attributes may be present, after 6 months, the color may change completely."

We believe its a she, shes very timid and skiddish, she doesn't really like people a lot. She does sing her tunes but not a lot, shes fairly quite. We believe shes deaf tho, because shes very loud and before we clipped her wings she would try to fly she couldn't navigate or land without crashing. She loves bitting, but not normaly hard, mostly likes chewing on fabric.  We got her for my other bird so he wasnt alone while we worked and were away till he got sick and past away. We got another one about 2-3 months ago under a year that is a pearl and shows signs of being female. She has warmed up quite alot though with the new bird."

cockatiel,3ch3vq,ProfessorRJ,7,Tue Jul 7 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult to tell until the cockatiel molts and develops its adult plumage.  This doesn't happen until the cockatiel is roughly 9-12 months old.   Until then, females and juveniles of both sexes have roughly the same markers - grey faces and barring on the wings and tail. It isn't until the first molt that males lose these markers to have solid wings and tails, and a yellow head.  This is, of course, only for the typical grey cockatiel. Mutations are a whole different story.  tl;dr If it isn't an adult, there's no way to say for certain without a DNA test."
cockatiel,3ch3vq,painesgrey,2,Tue Jul 7 23:09:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for answering!  This is what I read online as well but I wasn't sure because this ones head was kind of already yellow so I thought it would be a male. I wanted this subs opinion on it bc the people at Petsmart know close to nothing about cockatiels.
cockatiel,3ch3vq,brad218,3,Tue Jul 7 23:39:49 2015 UTC,It is hard to tell with juvenile birds. Once they become a bit older body language and vocal behavior can be indicators too.  I see males tend to puff out their wings and chest and be more vocal. Females I see less aggressive. There are exceptions to every rule though.
cockatiel,3ch3vq,theotherguy96,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:07:01 2015 UTC,females have a dark pattern under their tail males dont and also males have darker chicks while females' chicks are faded
cockatiel,3ch3vq,puzzleimpulse,2,Wed Jul 8 00:21:45 2015 UTC,"Generally, a male will have a much yellower face, while a female will have less yellow. Males are generally much brighter than females, as goes for a lot of birds."
cockatiel,3cdnj7,cirrus42,8,Tue Jul 7 02:31:00 2015 UTC,Looks like a bruise.  He must have crashed into something.
cockatiel,3cdnj7,vaqari,5,Tue Jul 7 03:32:26 2015 UTC,"If the cockatiel refuses to eat, OP should go to the vet.  Sometimes, bruises on the beak (or an additional invisible one under the beak) hurt too much if the bird eats."
cockatiel,3cdnj7,yayachiken,2,Tue Jul 7 13:46:54 2015 UTC,"My first thought was a bruise as well, but it looks a bit funny to me? I'd keep an eye on it and if the bird is eating fine and acting normal I wouldn't worry. But if he starts not eating or acting off a vet visit wouldn't be a bad idea."

I was concerned too but a few months back when I took her in for grooming, the guy doing it called it a racing stripe and that it is a mutation. There is no reason to be alarmed. Yours could be from crashing but if he isnt refusing food and scratches near that area then dont worry about it."

cockatiel,3bwsqp,AshChar07,0,Thu Jul 2 21:50:58 2015 UTC,Its actually to get nutrients. Make sure you have gravel for digestion in the cage
cockatiel,3bwsqp,bbbbirdistheword,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:24:53 2015 UTC,It's not always to get nutrients. That has been determined to be poorly researched in general. They don't actually know why birds do it. And not all birds need gravel.
cockatiel,3bwsqp,pubestic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"Is he eating the dried poop or the fresh poop?  I've seen my birds ""eat"" dried poop from time to time, mainly as a habit of cleaning their favourite perching areas. Upon closer inspection, 99% of the dried poop crumbles out of their beak when they ""chew"" it.  Here are some tips:   Clean his cage more often (just scrape it off) Provide several feeding dishes (he'll get bored of one dish in the same place) Mix up the food (pellets, seeds, veggies, hard-boiled egg, etc)"
cockatiel,3bwsqp,lotuslane,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"It's fresh poop that he eats. He'll clean off his perches when they've got dry poop, which I know is just his habit."
cockatiel,3bwsqp,urgthrash,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:50:20 2015 UTC,You might want to reposition his perches so that poop doesn't land on them. I'd also recommend asking his vet. Good luck
cockatiel,3bwsqp,lotuslane,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:15:36 2015 UTC,Do you have a cuddle bone in the cage for your bird? If not i would get one. It gives him something to nibble on and its good for them. I have noticed my birds go thru cuddle bones like mad in the summer months.

I'm not sure any advice I could give is very good though since I'm still struggling to build trust myself :D"
cockatiel,3bshsz,MissMoo85,2,Wed Jul 1 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah... Tiels are such little babies. While not the most majestic birds out there or as cute as say a puppy, they're quite adorable in person and fun pet to have! I hope mine can be comfortable enough to come out sooner then later though."
cockatiel,3bshsz,diggory_x,3,Wed Jul 1 22:58:59 2015 UTC,"Overall I think you are doing the right thing, spending regular time with him so his comfort levels will grow. Couple of small adjustments though:  Instead of Sunflower seeds, see if you can get millet sprays. They are the key to a 'tiel's heart.  You also said you either try to approach from behind or leave your hand near behind him? Go for the front instead, he is probably seeing the approach from behind as threatening. When you want to train a tiel to walk onto your hand you need to gently nudge them on their lower stomach so they are almost forced to step up onto your finger to avoid behind shoved back. Obviously not forcefully but enough to they have to react. Accompanying it with a verbal command like ""step up"" will in grain the action into them.   It is normal for them to sometimes react to your hand with a bit of a nip if they are feeling cranky or rebellious but they will eventually learn who is boss.   Mine isn't that well trained but she sure as hell knows what step up means!"
cockatiel,3bshsz,ghostofpennwast,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:53:29 2015 UTC,"Hahaha that's what I've been trying to do! Nudge him on the stomach or near his feet but then he squeals and bites me! I find it adorable, but I don't think he's having much fun with that. I need to keep trying I guess until his comfort level is enough to leave that safety net of a perch."
cockatiel,3bshsz,marge-bouvier,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:58:02 2015 UTC,Please make sure you have a diet for your birth other than sunflower seeds. You should be feeding your bird a store bought mix or something.   Millet should only be like a once a week thing. Or like 10 percent of their diet max
cockatiel,3bshsz,Solieus,2,Thu Jul 2 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we feed him a mixed we bought from the pet store. I also read it's wise to feed whole veggies and fruits for him to peck on from the natural nutrients."
cockatiel,3bshsz,Solieus,2,Thu Jul 2 15:38:22 2015 UTC,Fruits and veggies are a good idea for extra nutrients.  Just remember that a lot of grocery store produce is loaded with pesticides and preservatives. Organic no pesticide produce is safer because even little trace amounts of chemicals can harm a small bird.   It's also important to make sure the fruit or veggie is not bad for cockatiels.  Onions for example are not safe.
cockatiel,3bshsz,Solieus,2,Sun Jul 5 07:40:35 2015 UTC,"I hope you can get your birdie some different types of perches of different shapes / sizes - they're good for working his feet so they don't get cramped from being in the same spot all day. A ladder or rope perch is a great start. They will also create different levels to the cage to give him more things to do.  Does he have toys? Get him some birdie toys! My tiel loves anything with bells and he adores his swing! He likes climbing around, too, so ladders or other things to help him climb might be good.  Seeds only is not really a great diet; please consider trying pellets out with him if you can. Maybe see if he will eat veggies or fruits. And make sure he has a cuttlebone at all times for minerals.  If you talk to him at all, try whistling too and learning his language. My tiel now knows some different whistles so that I can tell what he is trying to say, in very vague terms of course. He has a cute little ""whee?"" sound when he is being shy, will wolf whistle as a greeting, and does a contact call every time we go upstairs, basically ""hey! where are you going?!""  Being beside budgies is fine but please don't mix them in the same cage. My tiel I had when I was a kid was housed with a budgie (my mother knew nothing about birds) and I swear he bullied him to his early grave. Budgies are very aggressive."

cockatiel,3brqkv,cockatielFriend,6,Wed Jul 1 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"Um. The second paragraph of your linked article says the following:  ""The first misconception is that processed diets are dangerously toxic to birds. The percentage of birds fed these diets, that develop kidney disease is very low, probably less than half of one percent.""  I'm really sorry your little friend is ill, but I don't think you can blame her diet."
cockatiel,3brqkv,TWFM,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"That statement is ambiguous.  If a processed diet makes one in 200 birds sick, that is still a problem.  The article reads like a whitewash: the benevolent-sounding  ""birds with latent kidney disease are more likely to show symptoms on a processed diet"" seems indistinguishable from the terrifying ""a processed diet exacerbates latent kidney disease"".  The nutritional deficiencies of an all-seed diet can be addressed in other ways than pellets."
cockatiel,3brqkv,cojoco,3,Wed Jul 1 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"In order to make any sense out of that statistic, we'd have to know the percentage of birds on other diets who develop kidney disease.  For example, what if 0.5 percent of the birds who eat nothing but pellets develop it, but 2 percent of the birds who eat a varied diet do?"
cockatiel,3brqkv,TWFM,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think the article makes ambiguous statements at all:   A bird with poorly functional kidneys due to diseases (past or present), toxins, hereditary and/or congenital defects, are more likely to show clinical signs of their kidney disease when fed a processed diet, especially a breeder diet. The low incidence of kidney disease being seen is likely to coincide with the incidence of underlying kidney disease in a flock. The diet isn't causing the kidney disease, but the kidney disease can become obvious when a processed food is fed.   Is pretty much getting directly to the important points: You can't say a pelleted diet causes kidney disease simply because the number of cases is so low, low enough to correspond to natural occurrences of the disease in any population of tiels. Basically what people should be remembering in cases like this is correlation =/= causation.    If a processed diet makes one in 200 birds sick, that is still a problem.   You yourself are falling into the correlation/causation trap here.    The article reads like a whitewash: the benevolent-sounding ""birds with latent kidney disease are more likely to show symptoms on a processed diet"" seems indistinguishable from the terrifying ""a processed diet exacerbates latent kidney disease"".   Well they seem indistinguishable because they ARE saying the same thing (i.e. that birds with a genetic predisposition for or existing kidney disease will more likely show it on a processed diet). Why? Some vets believe it is because birds on a pelleted diet don't drink enough water on their own. This is not the case with all birds though so again, we should not be dissuading tiel owners away from pellets all together. As the article points out:   Frequently fear and reaction has replaced common sense. Some people have actually returned to seed diets and cafeteria style feeding, risking widespread nutritional deficiencies and imbalances. Don't feed your birds a deficient diet in order to protect the few birds that might have an underlying kidney malfunction and should have a place in a bird's varied diet.   Because while people CAN feed a nutritionally complete diet with foods other than pellets, many people do not have the means or motivation to put in the effort (not everyone is an all-star bird owner like many of us on reddit). Pellets are a source of easy, guaranteed nutrition."
cockatiel,3brqkv,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"The diet isn't causing the kidney disease, but the kidney disease can become obvious when a processed food is fed.   As I said, the diet ""exacerbates kidney disease"".  That is scary enough.   Pellets are a source of easy, guaranteed nutrition.    ... which exacerbates kidney disease."
cockatiel,3brqkv,cojoco,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand that your point was to emphasize that pellets exacerbate kidney disease. I'm not disagreeing with that at all, I just think most people will agree that the half a percent of birds that exhibit symptoms of the disease is probably much less than the number of birds risking premature death + the host of conditions caused by a poor diet, and so it is not worth telling everyone to remove pellets from their bird's diets completely.    As I said, the diet ""exacerbates kidney disease"". That is scary enough.   Yes but again, the chance this will actually happen to a person's bird is probably much lower than if it had a fatal accident or was nutrient deficient. It's like worrying about a leaky faucet when your house is on fire. Note this is exactly the type of misdirected fear the author of the article warns about.  So sure you are avoiding potentially exacerbating a disease in a few birds that are already genetically predisposed to it, but realistically the benefits of pellets still greatly outweigh the costs in most cases."

cockatiel,3bg6r4,Durchii,3,Sun Jun 28 23:03:27 2015 UTC,Do they contain honey? Too much honey can get birds stoned and they pass out.
cockatiel,3bg6r4,Learnincurve,3,Mon Jun 29 07:59:00 2015 UTC,I just checked a bag I have and they don't. That's really interesting though!

cockatiel,3bblx7,JoshuaRAWR,7,Sat Jun 27 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"She's still a BABY! That's the baby ""i'm hungry"" sound. It doesn't go away till a few months. And once in a while, your bird may make it with things she doesn't like or whatever. For example, my 10 year old bird makes the sound when she is being toweled off after a bath.   Really, your bird will outgrow it. It's a way for babies to get attention and cared for."
cockatiel,3bblx7,cacille,3,Sun Jun 28 08:01:29 2015 UTC,I wish you patience.
cockatiel,3bblx7,Misspissyoants,2,Sun Jun 28 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"It sounds like she's just getting settled in and used to you.  Since the vet says she's physically fine, you probably just need to give her some time to settle in and she should be OK.    If your bird was sleeping before the thrashing you described happened it was probably a night terror which happens from time to time with cockatiels.  This website has a lot of helpful information about cockatiels and has info on screaming and night frights."
cockatiel,3bblx7,marge-bouvier,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:12:13 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone, thank you all for the information, i just want to provide a quick update, everythings all fine now and she hasn't had any screechy episodes.  It was a simple matter of her food, she wasn't fond of what was in her food bowl, so i bought another brand of seed and she adores it, the previous seed i had for her was kind of chunky, but this other stuff is fairly small, and she's going nuts for it and hasn't screeched since. She's such a picky little thing!"

cockatiel,3b86ss,kitsuneko88,0,Fri Jun 26 20:50:33 2015 UTC,:D This is adorable! Does your dog bark often? My late cockatiel learned our field spaniel's bark and mimicked him years after he passed away and we determined his word for dog was that dog's name. They always went nose to nose it was the sweetest.
cockatiel,3b86ss,kitsuneko88,0,Fri Jun 26 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"He barks quite a bit, Pete will just usually ignore it. Sometimes it'll spook him and he'll take off -- but most of the time he's okay.   And awh that's sweet :) and I'm sorry for your loss :("

cockatiel,3b86ss,myaussiefriends,-1,Sat Jun 27 01:22:01 2015 UTC,"Birds are incredibly fragile. It could take playful behavior to kill your bird. And they can move a lot faster than you can.  Like it or not, your dog is a predator and your cockatiel is prey. You do not mix them together. That doesn't mean you can't keep both a dog/cat/rat/ferret in the same home as your bird, but you MUST keep them separate.   Do your research."

cockatiel,3aye16,Phuni,2,Wed Jun 24 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"It's funny, although he'll gladly step onto my finger or eat out of my hand, the only way he'll let me scratch his head outside the cage is when he flies around enough to get too tired to try to bite my hand, and then he gives in and really loves the scratching. So I was quite surprised when he just kept pushing his head back into my hand and eventually ended up lying on his back :) He's quite eccentric, I suppose, but we do get along."

cockatiel,3ayrcg,diggory_x,4,Wed Jun 24 16:08:30 2015 UTC,"Our tiel gets ""matey"" with our computer printer. Whenever we print something out and she hears it running, she gets really excited and flies over.   We have not been able to figure out why she likes the printer so much, but she obviously does. With your tiel, maybe it's something about hearing the spoon stirring the tea, or the teapot whistle, or some kind of sound that's triggering it for her?   Or maybe we will just never understand cockatiel love."

What sort of things specifically would you send to, for example, a cockatiel owner?  I like the idea but unfortunately I am not in the US. Good luck though!"
cockatiel,3awvc6,diggory_x,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your feedback, and yes the website is still in development. Should have it polished off soon!  For a cockatiel owner and owners of other ""Medium"" Sized birds, we would send all natural, gourmet treats, that are too small for larger birds and/or too big for smaller birds.   We also work with a bird trainer and breeder to select the best toys for each size of bird, along with maintenance tools in all packages, such as plumage drops for water, high quality cuttlebones, and beak sharpening toys.   And, we are planning on shipping internationally so don't worry! If you sign up for the newsletter on the site, you will be first to know when the service goes live, along with special deals and promotions.  Thanks again for your feedback!"
cockatiel,3awvc6,cacille,2,Wed Jun 24 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"I am interested in this for my bird. Though I agree, the website is dated and just needs more info, for example about the types of toys, treats, etc. Also clarification. Personally, I am currently confused about your subscriptions. When I sign up for a 3 month subscription, does that mean I will receive 3 boxes - one per month - for 3 months? Or does it mean that I will receive 3 boxes - one per 4 months?   Personally, I would rather sign up for a 3 month - one per 4 months type arrangement. This is because my bird does not get treats often and toys last her forever as she is not much of a toy bird. So I would rather have something spaced out over a year. Of course, I could just order monthly, which I may end up doing. Just wanna make sure your info is clear on the subject."

cockatiel,3aubvi,bawbay,8,Tue Jun 23 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"The bird is probably still in the area somewhere.  What you should do is take her cage and put it outside.  If she see's it, there is a good chance she will recognize it and go to it.  If you have any pictures, post them around the neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods.  You would be surprised how often people will spot her.    Lastly, one of our birds got out a long time ago.  He was a people person tiel, and he was gone for two weeks.  Turns out he was living up the life with some other family (the whore).  He landed on a kids shoulder 2 days after flying away and did his ""what are you doing""  The kid brought him home and his mom kept him and took care of him.  2 weeks later She saw the missing bird post (it wasn't even a picture but a poorly hand drawn poster of a tiel) and she called up.  Next thing you know, Harvey is back in our lives and just turned 10 the other day.  All this happened probably 7 years ago btw."

cockatiel,3aubvi,budgiebum,3,Tue Jun 23 16:04:03 2015 UTC,Yeah my bro is a dick but Angel was closest to him. He'd kinda put her at the door and tell her how all the other birds didn't chirp as much as she did or whatever.  Also I'm in Scotland so not sure about which sites to ask on.

I choose to believe he joined a flock of wild (not cockatiel but a similar type of small parrot we have around here) and made friends. Why not?  But it's been only a day. Good luck, maybe Angel do comes back."

cockatiel,3aubvi,randomnonwhiteguy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:11:43 2015 UTC,We found our cockatiel Percy some years ago in our backyard and after an extensive search to find the proper owner we ended up keeping it.  I know another family who also found a bird in a similar situation.  I'm telling you this because I've been told by other bird owners who lost their own birds that it made them feel better.   Just know that someone will notice your bird.  They will most likely try to find the rightful owner and if they can't they will make sure it is taken care of.  Since we've had Percy he's gotten out twice but luckily didn't get to far and we found him.
cockatiel,3aubvi,myaussiefriends,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:33:22 2015 UTC,We had two birds fly out of the door when the phone rang at an inopportune time.  We put flyers up at local vet offices and bird stores.  Someone brought one of our birds in to the local bird store and they had just put up our flyer!    Cockatiels are pretty friendly so lost ones tend to get adopted by their rescuers.  I hope you find your Angel!

cockatiel,3aqugc,ZOOSHINE,3,Mon Jun 22 19:41:12 2015 UTC,"I have. I've mentioned it a few times here and I will PM you with more info. My bird was fine. If your bird is currently in a HPAI (bird flu) state, he cannot leave the USA really (Well, the process is a bit more in depth than that)."
cockatiel,3aqugc,cacille,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:05:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. Going to have a read of your blog tonight, thanks for the resource!"
cockatiel,3aqugc,MikeBenza,3,Thu Jun 25 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"I brought my cockatiel from the US to France, back to the US, back to France, and back to the US again over two years.  To get her used to the carrier, I introduced it to her slowly -- first putting it near her, then setting her on it, then setting her just inside, closing her in for 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, an hour, overnight.  All over the course of about a month.  My bird's pretty skittish, so I think yours will be fine.  The only major difference is that you can fly to France with a bird in cabin, but to the UK it needs to be in cargo.  If your bird hasn't been out much, you should work on desensitizing him.  Move the cage to different parts of the house.  Once you get him comfortable in a carrier, bring him to a park.  Leave him (in his cage) at a neighbor's overnight.  When the weather is nice, put him outside (not in direct sunlight).  This will help him stress out less on a plane.  Anything you can do to introduce him to new situations and new people will help.  If you're worried about your bird having a bad time relocating, consider how he would feel about losing his only friends.  Don't consider leaving your bird behind."
cockatiel,3aqugc,MikeBenza,2,Thu Jun 25 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply, this was exactly the sort of anecdote I was looking for.  I will take your tips regarding getting him adjusted to be in a carrier and in unfamiliar places - he's not well traveled so he hasn't even been in many rooms of the house, but we have put him in his cage outside when doing household tasks like cleaning the oven and he doesn't seem to mind. I'm just thinking the dark cage under a seat (or God forbid in cargo) with the rumbling of the plane would be too much stress, and I wouldn't want anything to happen to him if he got a fright. And I wouldn't want him to be traumatised for life from a bad experience.  Did you have your cockatiel in the cabin with you? How many flights did you have to take from the U.S. to France?  Your last comment really tugged on my heartstrings, I really wish I could just tell my little guy that everything's alright and that there's nothing to worry about, alas I'm severely worried how the experience is going to affect him.  Thanks again."

cockatiel,3aqwc7,Tyega,2,Tue Jun 23 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like stretching possibly, or having a bit of fun to greet the day. My little guy has started stretching his wings and fanning his tail like that before bed, but he does it hanging upside down from his sleeping perch. It's the funniest thing."
cockatiel,3aqwc7,cableman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:12:29 2015 UTC,"Ha, mine does the same thing, and only before bed. Nowadays he'll do it as soon as he sees me spreading his cage cover. Once I grabbed a blue t-shirt and shook it off in the middle of the day, and the little dude went upside down, fanning his tail and spreading his wings, probably thinking it's bedtime, ha."
cockatiel,3aqwc7,Tyega,2,Wed Jun 24 23:10:29 2015 UTC,"That's hilarious, I love watching it so I encourage it by giving him a treat whenever he does it. He's a little butt though and does it for treats for a while then stops doing it and bangs his beak in demand for treats for nothing."
cockatiel,3aqwc7,kusznier1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"my two cockatiels do that all the time, morning after they wake up, during the day, (they have a whole room to them selfs, but if they nap or dont move for a bit, there wings are clipped to) and at night before they go to bed, its just stretching :)"
cockatiel,3aqwc7,jessicamooney,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:03:03 2015 UTC,I think she's trying to put a move on you ;)

cockatiel,3aq0h2,crystalw0lf,5,Mon Jun 22 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Just checking, but is that galvanized steel wire that his cage is made of? If it is you should definitely exchange it with a stainless steel mesh. Galvanized mesh or ""hardware cloth"" is coated with zinc to prevent rust, but zinc is incredibly toxic to birds. This zinc coating can easily chip off if a bird climbs or chews on the wire and it also becomes powdery, even more dangerous, when it is older/oxidized."
cockatiel,3aq0h2,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks so much for the heads up. I checked on this, they said it was a plastic coated mesh."
cockatiel,3aq0h2,Solieus,2,Wed Jun 24 08:49:43 2015 UTC,"He is shivering. Is it cold in your house?  He could just be scared I guess; crown is up too so go easy, maybe hand feeding him is too much for him right now."
cockatiel,3aq0h2,Solieus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"Nope its never cold where I live, hmm.. He come looking for food when I go near him so I doubt its the hand feeding, well maybe the phone was kinda new to him ? :)"

cockatiel,3aq0h2,lotuslane,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:46:43 2015 UTC,"What a cutie! :) As for getting him a buddy, it depends. How much time can you spend with him every day? If you can spend a good amount of time with him, you probably don't need to. If you do get another one, though, keep in mind that they should be in separate cages and even separate rooms in the beginning (look up how to introduce 2 cockatiels to each other) to increase the chances that they will get along. There's also the possibility that they won't get along.  Either way, good luck with this little one :) Just keep taking it slow and try not to intrude inside the cage as it should be his safe place. I would leave the door open and wait for him to be comfortable enough to come out before trying to get him on your hand."
cockatiel,3ap3ln,bambam_delfuturo,4,Mon Jun 22 10:21:39 2015 UTC,I think it means he's content and at ease. Pierrot usually does this when he's going to nap or when he's grinding his beak.

cockatiel,3ada8i,bambam_delfuturo,6,Fri Jun 19 04:27:16 2015 UTC,So cute. Give him lots of toys to explore.
cockatiel,3ada8i,budgiebum,3,Fri Jun 19 04:34:42 2015 UTC,Should I start giving him toys immediately or let him get accustomed to his new home first? I've put a perch in there because he kept trying to get higher.
cockatiel,3ada8i,budgiebum,5,Fri Jun 19 04:45:40 2015 UTC,Let him get accustomed first
cockatiel,3ada8i,DeadDiarrheaDeath,3,Fri Jun 19 05:05:10 2015 UTC,It looks like he is smiling. :)
cockatiel,3ada8i,LemonMagician,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:43:12 2015 UTC,My favourite part about this shaped beak is that it always looks like a smile. He's very cute.
cockatiel,3ada8i,LemonMagician,2,Sat Jun 20 06:37:26 2015 UTC,"Aww yay! I'm glad it worked out. He's such a cutie. Does his cage not have a grate at the bottom? He can potentially get sick from eating seeds he's dropped out of his food dish and pooped on, so be sure to clean frequently if so. Mine tries sooo hard to get through the grate at the bottom of his to get the dropped food. >.<"
cockatiel,3ada8i,sporkafunk,2,Fri Jun 19 06:34:24 2015 UTC,"It does but he's not used to having one in there, he was in an aviary before and just learning to eat off the ground. So I thought I'd leave it out for the trip home and the first few hours and put it in once he's calmed down and settled in. He's already starting to approach the side of the cage when we come near  :D"
cockatiel,3acnai,bambam_delfuturo,4,Fri Jun 19 00:52:34 2015 UTC,"Look at that short little baby crest, cute!"
cockatiel,3acnai,SweetxKiss,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:47:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure how old he is. We went last week to pick him and the breeder told me he was around 9 weeks old (I counted back to the week including April 8) then today when I've picked him up she has given me a not with his hatch date being the 3 of May. Which would only make him 6 weeks old. I'm thinking she may have gotten the months mixed up?  He is still bald on the back of his head, she said that his parents were kicking him out of the nest."
cockatiel,3acnai,SweetxKiss,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:17:44 2015 UTC,"Aww he's still a little thing though, poor sweet little baby haha. Enjoy your new bird pal! I'm sure he's happy to be with you now."

cockatiel,3acpyx,sanchoponcho,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:17:32 2015 UTC,Sounds like nesting behavior. I wouldn't put him under a blanket this is what he'll do. Is he alone for long periods during the day now? He could be getting lonely and depressed cause as you probably know cockatiels are very social. If you aren't available for him perhaps you can contact a rescue and look into foster-adopt a companion. they will work with you to find a compatible friend. Good luck. Sorry to hear of the rough patch you and Sancho are having.
cockatiel,3ab2no,mojjio,2,Thu Jun 18 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"For help in what to do in this situation, I would strongly recommend reading this until you get the chance to take the birds into a vet."
cockatiel,3ab2no,ExplicitInnuendo,2,Thu Jun 18 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"What I did was to get fake eggs and place them in the cage with the real egg, so the egg laying stops and also provide more cuttlebone for the birds."
cockatiel,3ab2no,iamanicellama,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:23:59 2015 UTC,also try /r/parrots for more info. I have none for you :(
cockatiel,3abjh9,Retta10Grams,3,Thu Jun 18 19:34:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend new toys. My birds tend to get scared with new things and need slow introduction.  Since the environment is new, it might stress the bird out more. Also make sure he/she gets enough sleep. They tend to be crabby if they dont ger enough sleep. Cover the cage at night, at least for 12 hours and make sure you have a small night light on. I wish the owner would have given you more instructions :-("
cockatiel,3abjh9,xdeadlykittenx,2,Thu Jun 18 23:00:52 2015 UTC,It really depends on his personality so probably what the owner says will help the best. Just be in the room and ignore him a bit. A lot of tiels are curious but don't like to be pushed. Other than that you sound concerned so that's a good thing. Just relax a bit and see how it goes. Good luck and keep us posted!
cockatiel,3abjh9,Misspissyoants,2,Thu Jun 18 21:49:53 2015 UTC,Did your friend mention whether he handles the bird? Our cockatiel climbs and walks around a lot when he wants to be let out of the cage. If he's used to being out daily then he may be expecting you to handle him or to be allowed to perch on top of the cage.  This is up to you - if the bird flies he could be difficult to get back in the cage.   It might also be useful to cover the cage up to black it out overnight or for short periods to calm him down. He'll still take a while to calm down but birds generally switch off after a while in the dark. (I wouldn't do this more than a couple of hours during the day or just from the evening and overnight)
cockatiel,3a9219,narufry,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:50:51 2015 UTC,Does she have a mate?  He might be plucking feathers from her when they're preening each other.
cockatiel,3a9219,cojoco,2,Thu Jun 18 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"She hangs out with my IRN, who will sometimes do a bit of work on her, but I dont feel like she'd let him do anything like that for that long? like they arent that tight with eachother.  she doesnt preen him, she just enjoys the scritches."
cockatiel,3a9219,cojoco,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:25:17 2015 UTC,"I had two birds for a while that were really close. The boy would give the girl scritches, but he'd occasionally pull a feather out of her head and she'd let out a great squawk.  In the end it looked like she'd had a tonsure."
cockatiel,3a9219,cojoco,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:37:08 2015 UTC,hmm.. I guess I'll have to keep an eye on them. Do you have any tips?
cockatiel,3a9219,adltchickadee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:38:13 2015 UTC,"No, not really ... it was kind-of an abusive relationship, but they were very fond of each other.  I don't know how to fix that."
cockatiel,3a6gtr,MirthSpindle,2,Wed Jun 17 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"I've only had my new bird a week and she wants to be scratched all over her face, and she'll even turn her head over so I can scratch her chin/under her beak.   My older male tiel doesn't want head scratches anywhere."
cockatiel,3a6gtr,SweetxKiss,2,Wed Jun 17 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"One of mine is 22 and I've been slowly taming him. Now he likes hugs in two hands and any kind of headrub, and kind of firm massage more than feather ruffling. His favourite spot is the ridge over his eye, and having the little cartiledge bit nudged back and forth. My newer guy is more picky. He likes his feathers ruffled above his ears, and his nose pressed on if he gets into it, but he tends to lure you in and then bite the finger that scritches him.  One trick I've found to suppress biting is windbaths. I've noticed that both of mine have multiple triggers for their bathing behaviour. Splashing water or heavy rain does it, but they don't really like getting wet. Watching trees blow around in the wind or standing by a window with gusty breezes does too. The strongest trigger seems to be a side to side tickling motion of the round feathers on their shoulders and upper wings, which you can do by blowing puffs of air across their shoulders. It works best if it's irregular like wind instead of rhythmic.   First they fluff up which I think feels like goosebumps as follicles raise the feathers. Then they sprawl out and turn their feathers completely inside out, which I think feels like yawning and stretching if it went on for minutes. It's also the best way to dust out their downy feathers, I got huge clouds of dust out of both the first time I did it.  For some reason, they can't bite while doing it. Not just less, but it seems to be a behaviour that suppresses biting, probably so they don't bite themselves while sprawling around. If they want to bite you it takes several seconds to gather themselves together, which gives more warning than normal bites during scritches. For my nippy guy, I let him approach and put his head down, then give his feathers a few puffs at a time in between scritches. If I keep him fluffed up but not quite turning inside out, he never manages to bite me."
cockatiel,3a6gtr,ohyoFroleyyo,2,Wed Jun 17 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"Waffles loves having his/her head, neck, and shoulder area (right above the top of his wings) ruffled and rubbed on, but he LOVES the area right around his beak scratched, and loves having me just hold his beak. Weirdo."
cockatiel,3a6gtr,Woozlebuttons,2,Thu Jun 18 00:34:30 2015 UTC,"mine will go completely trance-like when i hit a spot just right on the back of his bird neck, very carefully sort of massaging the bone around there. he definitely likes the beak getting massaged too. he hates long nails which is fine by me because i'm a lifelong nail picker (not biter), which also suits him. it sounds terrible, but i alleviate some of my picking compulsion with him through picking off flakes from his beak and gently massaging head-area pin feathers out from the keratin sheath to bring out the new feather."
cockatiel,3a6gtr,ChiquititoPollito,2,Thu Jun 18 03:43:04 2015 UTC,I love picking the old pin feather sheathes... it is so satisfying.
cockatiel,3a6gtr,ChiquititoPollito,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:12:48 2015 UTC,"yep me too, and you can tell my Polly likes it too, as long I don't touch it the wrong way! once the new feather is out i imagine it must feel like having an itch you've had for a while being scratched"
cockatiel,3a41li,idevourlife,7,Wed Jun 17 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"Q1: It's never too late to attempt hand taming, just don't move too fast. Spend a lot of time by his cage so he gets to know you/be comfortable around you. Move on to feeding him millet from your hand (not your palm, just hold the stick and let him nom away). Once you get familiar with him I think it'll be apparent how fast/slow you should go, as you'll understand his signals. I think a good way to invite him into you space and let him get comfortable is to leave the cage door open to allow him to come out of the cage on his own. A lot of birds like to just stand on top of the cage and hang out. This will help him orient to the space. It will take a lot of time for both of you to get comfy though! So be patient.   Q2: I think unscented is okay, as long as the flame is as far away from him as possible (and try to only burn when he's not at risk of flying onto the flame...like when he's in the cage). Definitely blow it out in another room as you said.   Q3: I've never had AC so I'm not sure about this one. As long as you don't think he'll be cold and it's not blowing on him directly I bet it's okay...just make sure it doesn't get too cold in there.   Hope that helps! Good luck!"
cockatiel,3a41li,natureabstract,3,Wed Jun 17 03:45:59 2015 UTC,"To add on to question 1...when I tamed one of my very un-tame cockatiels, I consciously chose to spend all my time in an armchair near her cage. Reading, surfing the internet, all that kind of thing, i'd do next to her. I think this really helped her see that I wasn't a threat. Make sure you don't make too much noise or move to quickly the first few weeks."
cockatiel,3a41li,natureabstract,2,Wed Jun 17 03:47:51 2015 UTC,I was actually planning to put a comfortable chair next to his cage so we could quietly hag out together and get to know one another! Thanks :)

I'd be worried about her trying to flap around while I am driving and causing me a distraction or even worse - escaping.  Is your's just well trained/behaved?
cockatiel,39zn54,diggory_x,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:32:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Pika is a doll, she just loves people and attention, and if she has to go anywhere, she'd rather be traveling right with you than be stuck in her cage. She's just really friendly, and she was a hand-fed baby, so she's quite mellow, and there's really no reason to put her in a cage while I drive, and I can usually just cup her gently against my chest when someone opens the car so she doesn't fly away. My other bird Raichu is pretty much terrified of being anywhere other than his cage (I think his old owners were bad to him), so if I ever take him on a drive, I just put the entire cage in the car. He's perfectly fine, and within a few minutes, he'll be preening away without a care in the world. Basically, you should try different things, but above all, make sure your girl is happy."

But my girl we got a little older, and she took weeks to warm up to us. Took a month or so before she'd allow pats, and scritches weren't allowed for ages... Until one day she accidentally stayed still long enough and discovered she loved them. Now she won't go away! But she has a very skittish nature, where as my boy is always relaxed. It all depends on the bird!"

What I did was I'd give him a kiss, and then rub the top of his head with my nose - he was okay with that. Then I would have to take my hand, place it on the back of my head, slide it up over the top and down the front and replace my nose with a finger. Pretty much, I had to get my hand up there without him noticing. Eventually he would realize that the fingers weren't so bad after all."

He was friendly since day one, but he would try to call for his former owners the first week. Now he won't leave my side when i'm home. He usually sits on me or on my keyboard.  But he hates hands. It's really problematic since he sits on my keyboard so often. I also want to be allowed to scratch his little head some day !   I started to clicker/target train him, getting him to touch my finger before getting a treat for example. He gets better at the exercise, but as soon as the training ends, he hates hands again. Any suggestions ?"

One I've posted previously pretty accurately reflects her relationship with me right now.   If he's home, she won't let me take her out of the cage. She's never been terribly affectionate with me, in that she likes to hang out with me and be on my shoulder or nap on my leg when I'm on the couch, and she loves showers with me, but I've never seen her like this in the five years I've had her. She rubs her face on his, turns her head upside down for a headscratch, is all-around adorable with him and hateful toward me.   I'm not jealous, but I am concerned that she's going to completely freak out when this living situation ends. Roommate and I get along famously (have been friends for 10+ years) but this was only intended as a year-long living arrangement. Is this just a crush and she'll be back to her normal self soon? Do I need to be concerned about severe attachment issues in the future?"

cockatiel,39hmc5,penguinpaige,2,Thu Jun 11 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"I can't explain the sudden change, but it's very common for female birds to be more attached to male humans. I (female) had my female cockatiel for a few years before she decided to fall in love with my dad. She doesn't hate me now (or then), though. She just greatly prefers him. Do you only have one bird? I now have two and they both get along fine with everyone, probably since they have each other for company most of the day."

Although if she ever heard my mom's voice on the phone, she'd flip out in the cutest way. No negative effects.   Also, we had another tiel who just bonded to men more than women. Or women with short hair. We always figured the tiel had some history with long hair that we never knew about."

It's possible they're stuck or something (one of our conures feathers got stuck too, we assumed he'd get it out himself but the grippable area for him to pull it out was too small.) Maybe a groomer/vet could take a look at it and let you know for sure. Of course with all molting feathers, have patience."

cockatiel,39hb2a,Lime_Slime64,2,Thu Jun 11 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't ever scratch himself that is odd, you may want to have him checked out by a vet. Its sad to see a bird that needs a little help and won't take it.  I hope your bird will eventually let you help him    It took about 1 year and a lot of work for our cockatiel who was an old fella when we got him to let me scritch his head.  He still will almost never let my husband scritch him even though he otherwise loves attention from him.  He didn't let anyone touch his face at his previous home where he lived for nearly 20 years.  Here is a step by step of how I got our old curmudgeon to like scritches. This process took about 1 year:   I started out feeding him a millet treat and while he was totally engrossed with the treat I would occasionally lightly touch just he top of his crest once.   He would snap and threaten at first.   When he started mostly tolerating that,  I then also started resting my hand as close to him as he would tolerate while he sat on his cage eating his treat - started out about 1 foot away.   Eventually, I got close enough putting my hand by him that he could reach out and bite me and sometimes he would.  I let him bite away a quite a few times, keeping my hand still not moving away or towards him even though it hurt like you know what.  He'd bite for awhile and then eventually give up, and I'd then move my hand away.   After about a month of this he then just started letting me scritch him.  I started out with just little top of the head scritches and went from there.  Something I noticed is I am right handed, and he prefers if I scritch him with my left hand... not sure why.   He now begs for scritches and gets them every day.   Begs isn't really the right word, it's more like he demands them.  I do still give him his space though and now if I offer a scritch and he hisses or threatens I just leave him be.  TL/DR: It took a long time, a lot patience, and for me to be willing to let him bite me for my bird to want scritches.  I hope yours maybe will catch on a little quicker."

Of course he is pissed off and scared!  Just leave him alone to sulk for a while. Make sure he has access to food and water and keep talking to him when you can but do not try to force your hand on him as he isn't in a state to accept it yet.

cockatiel,39574d,diggory_x,2,Tue Jun 9 14:12:49 2015 UTC,"I was going to say what diggory_x did - moving can be stressful on its own, and the unfortunate accident at the vet's probably made him grumpier. It will probably take some time for Leo to adjust to his new environment. Avoid making loud noises or sudden movements, and talk to him in a soft voice.   Depending on what the cages are like, you could try opening both doors and putting them against each other so he can go to the new cage on his own. In addition to food and water, make sure he has some toys to play with and chew on."
cockatiel,39574d,spockatiel,2,Tue Jun 9 15:17:16 2015 UTC,Sounds like a pretty scary few days! I would leave him be mostly. Give him some millet or some kind of treat and speak to him in a higher voice.

cockatiel,39258i,MKUMBRA,2,Mon Jun 8 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"Do you cover him? We have a bedtime ritual. Shortly before bed we darken the room a bit by closing the blinds, start cleaning up and tell him it's off to bed. It doesn't hurt that he goes when we go. We cover him up and he's good til we get up. But lock him in his cage and stay up? No way...flock is up and so is he.   If you want him to get his rest you may want to put him in a quiet room or area and cover him up. I think it is very difficult for them to feel calm when there is activity around their cage."
cockatiel,39258i,Misspissyoants,2,Mon Jun 8 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"When I'm home my cockatiel is out of his cage and wandering all the time. I have a separate perch that I used to train him to poop on command. So every 20 minutes or so I'll pick him up, put him on the perch and tell him to poop. He poops almost immediately and then climbs down and continues doing his thing. As long as I remember to put him on his poop perch, I don't have any surprise messes to clean up."
cockatiel,39258i,Spamcaster,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"I put my bed to bird at 8:30-9 pm each night. I lock him in his cage and he starts climbing around like he wants to get out, then he complains when I cover his cage every night. After that though he stays quiet and goes to sleep. I don't think my bird knows he wants to go to sleep because the lights are still on in the house so he complains, but once hes in the dark he realizes he wants to sleep. I agree with misspissyoants, if you cover your bird he will probably go to sleep and will be fine."
cockatiel,39258i,jackpfree,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:49:49 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest that since he's a young bird, you could try letting him stay up until he gets sleepy or until you go to sleep too.  See if it makes a difference for a few days... Not a lot to lose, possibly much to gain."
cockatiel,39258i,CTYANKEE44,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:09:12 2015 UTC,"As others have suggested, if he seems restless at night, cover his cage with a dark blanket. I always put mine in his cage, tell him goodnight, turn off the lights and then cover his cage if he's restless. He calms down after a few minutes and stays quiet until I uncover him in the morning. If I wait too long in the morning he starts saying ""what are you doing"" and ""come here"" over and over until he's uncovered lol."
cockatiel,39258i,Spamcaster,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:24:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's because he's young. My bird is almost 2, and he was the same way up until a few months ago (heh, you think this is bad, wait until you reach bird puberty.)  Do you cover the cage with a blanket? My bird used to fuss over bedtime every night - he'd fly around the room to avoid having to go to bed. We changed his sleep schedule - up everyday at 10, in bed every night around 9. That seemed to help.  He even puts himself to bed now sometimes.  I think it's something he's just going to have to get over, like a kid would.   My bird, however, does not do daytime cage time. When he wakes up the cage door opens and it doesn't close until bedtime, and he will throw a fit if I put him in the cage and closed the door during the day time - unless of course he's being a punk and he's going on birdy time out, in which case I cover him.  Anyway, I would suggest trying to get his sleep schedule as set as possible. I look over at my litle guy around 9 and I can see he's all poofy, tired and ready for bed.  Hope some of this helps!"

Make sure you find out what he is currently eating (hopefully not just seed!) so you aren't giving him something totally new to him when you take him home. If they do have him eating just seeds, get him on pellets and veggies ASAP. Most birds take to Zupreem's fruit blend very quickly.  Make sure the cage you get for him is a decent size. Most people say 24 x 18 x 24, but honestly go bigger if you can. Birds are way happier when they have a large living space. Make sure he knows where his food and water are. Splash the water a bit while he's looking at you do it. Don't put too many toys in his cage at first, because cockatiels are scared of EVERYTHING new. Mine screamed bloody murder when I tried to give him cardboard for the first time, lol. Having a few perches and 1-2 toys is good enough for the first couple of days, and then give him a few more one at a time. Perches need to be of varying sizes so his feet get good exercise. Some cockatiel owners don't cover their birds cages at night, but I'd really recommend it. Use something that his nails can't get stuck in for whatever touches the cage. I use a bed sheet, and then one of those lightweight fleece blankets you can get at walmart for like $5 on top of that. 12 hours of alone time in the (mostly) dark seems to help them not be grumpy the next day.   Something to be aware of that comes as a surprise for most new owners is that cockatiels have nightmares. Put a nightlight near his cage if possible. That way if he freaks out from one and starts flapping around, he can see his surroundings and not injure himself. If he does have a nightmare and you hear it (I promise you, you and everyone in a mile radius will hear it) check on him and look him over for injuries. I've had mine for 4 years, and he's only ever had 3, so it isn't very frequent.  Get him a lava stone to keep his beak nice and trimmed. I use this.   I can't think of anything else right now, but I hope this helped!"

cockatiel,38l3n9,jackpfree,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:54:44 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that's KEY to earning a birds trust. I read that your bird mostly shies away from your finger. I think that may be better than if your bird was lunging at your finger as some cockatiels will do.
cockatiel,38l3n9,doPiaui,2,Tue Jun 30 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"Be patient, let your cockatiel hang out with you on your shoulder or on the couch or something if your watching tv for a long time before you try and pet the bird. Also cockatiels tend to only really like their head to be touched, they do not like their back being pet and they get really pissed if you touch their tail lol"

cockatiel,38l3n9,lotuslane,2,Fri Jun 5 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  They are wonderful little companions that LOVE snuggles!  My 'tiels are very much into just being on a shoulder or foot or leg or right up under my face.  They are affectionate and occasionally moody and get grumpy before bedtime.  They are made of probably 50% dust and 50% poop, but the both can be cleaned easily.  My babies love to shred any papers, toys, tissues, boxes etc, so I have to keep a steady stream of shreddable toys cycling through their cages.  Keep up with just being near your bird and talking to her and making her know you are safe.  I'm sure you'll get her trained in no time!"

cockatiel,38jv7w,chaddjohnson,6,Thu Jun 4 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"Did you research the differences between handfed and natural raised cockatiels? This is a bird that thinks it's a human, 30 minutes of your attention is NOTHING. Parrots can see your moods like an aura, they know exactly what annoys you and what to do to get your attention and what they want. With mine, i simply ignore any noise they make if I put them in their cage and say ""bye"" or ""see  you later"" or ""goodnight"".  they know I won't be back for a while.  If you don't have the patience or attention span for that, I don't suggest getting a parrot. You have to talk to a hand raised bird like a child, let them know what's going on or they are going to freak out.  Google ""potty training"" parrots: basically I reward mine when they stay where they should in the room (mine are rarely in their cages) or hold their tail if I don't want them to poop somewhere. But the poop is not smelly, easy to clean with hot water, and kinda part of owning a parrot.   As for the chewing, what is he allowed to chew on? what do you give him to distract him from what you don't want him to chew on? You can't just put a parrot in a cage and expect him to be happy. You can let him loose in a house either without laying down rules and tons of supervised time. I birds probably need 2-3 years training before they are allowed out without supervision."
cockatiel,38jv7w,happycheese86,4,Thu Jun 4 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"First of all what kinds of toys does he have? When was the last time you rotated out the toys? How many shreddable toys does he have? First you need to teach him how to self entertain. Make sure he has a variety of toys to play with and knows how to play with them as with any bird ""a busy beak is a happy beak""."
cockatiel,38jv7w,Colorguarder08,3,Fri Jun 5 03:29:35 2015 UTC,Hang in there! Sounds like you are a caring guardian to Charlie. We've had something like this with our 20 yr. old cockatiel. First has Charlie been to an avian vet for blood work etc? You want to be sure there isn't an infection that can go to his bones (and air sac) they mask these until it is too late. If it is in the bones it can be painful and if that's the case he could scream for that as well as wanting companionship from you. Does he have a flat perch or something that he can get off his feet? We found that our tiel needed that after screaming and not knowing what he needed. We also discovered he had an infection and luckily caught it before it did damage although the vet said she thought it may have gotten into the bones at first and that is why he screamed until we figured out he was happier if he could be off a perch for part of the day and lay on a comfortable flat surface.  If you haven't taken him to an avian vet yet I highly recommend it. Good luck to you and Charlie!
cockatiel,38jv7w,lotuslane,3,Thu Jun 4 18:52:19 2015 UTC,Is the poop really a big issue? Sure cockatiels go to the bathroom every 15-30 min but its not like its a big clean up or smelly or anything.   If I worked from home my cockatiel would also probably scream for attention if he knew I was home
cockatiel,38jv7w,jackpfree,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely try potty training. It was a breeze when we did it although our cockatiel was young.  Chewables a must, boxes, paper, wood. They can be very trying some days, do some research, it will help you cope with it."
cockatiel,38jv7w,Misspissyoants,0,Fri Jun 5 21:33:48 2015 UTC,"All that behavior was more than likely instilled by the breeder along with you. He sees him self being head of the flock more than likely since you mentioned you put him up on your shoulder, you are technically giving him the mind set that he's above you and rules the roost. I have no idea if its possible to potty train a tiel but Im sure it is, I cant help you out there as Ive always just put up with it. If he's chewing on household items go out and purchase a bird playground for him. I had a friend that had the screaming issues and all you can do is ignore it, when you go into the room after he's been screaming you have been giving him what he wanted, your attention. Just ignore it completely and he should eventually get the point. Well, it's never enough with a bird, they are extremely sociable animals and love contact with their flock. Just work on the issues for a bit and stuff will get better."
cockatiel,38jv7w,PenskeForLifeeeeee2,-7,Thu Jun 4 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"I give mine a shower if they are being noisy for no reason. Shuts them up for hours and most of them hate water. I will also put them on the floor and wait til they beg to get picked up. Simple, non-aggressive punishment."

cockatiel,38bvey,Talllkitten,3,Wed Jun 3 05:28:13 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU for rescuing these poor birds! First have you taken them to an avian vet to be checked out? They can also adivse about their particular behavior. Do you have wood/wicker/palm toys they can shred? That would discourage plucking. My tiels love palm such as this http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?pcatid=8400  It can be strung between the bars of the cage. I fashion a wreath with it and they play with it while out on top of their cage. Soft wood, wicker, Yucca (kabobs) etc. I think are good bets for toys. My tiels have never cared for anything plastic (unless there's a bell attached). Good luck and thanks again for giving them what they have long deserved, a good home and a chance to have the dignity they should have had all along."
cockatiel,38bvey,lotuslane,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:37:50 2015 UTC,I appreciate the feedback! I will definitely look into palm toys! I'll be scheduling a vet appointment soon. I didn't want to stress them out more by having them travel so soon.
cockatiel,38bvey,lotuslane,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"Another note. As I found out with my two tiels and my vet told me as well, like people some birds don't like each other. That may or may not be the case with your two. We had our male for 4 years when we adopted our female from a shelter. They did cuddle together at night but our male would be territorial and nip at her at times. The female ended up being special needs and needing another cage and it was better to have them separated. Hopefully your two will work it out but something to keep in mind. They may need separate cages. Again, good luck."

Also, your cockatiel may not actually want to bathe.  Some don't.  They produce a fluid for cleaning their feathers, so they don't actually need baths.  Some like it, some don't.  I asked my vet about it and she said her cockatiel will take a bath or shower maybe once a year or two.  So if yours won't shower or bathe, don't worry."

cockatiel,38as0y,flixxx2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"A couple things:   some birds just hate it. They might never not hate it. My bird would always fly off the perch and land on the bottom of the shower and it really freaked me out, that he'd hurt himself. That said, he did sometimes enjoy it so definitely try out a shower perch (Amazon is best) and keep it out of the direct water, but close to you so he can reach misty water if he leans out. A few times before you actually take him into the shower with you, let him chill in the bathroom so he can get used to the noise.   On spray bottles: this is what my bird prefers. I set him on top of the shower where he likes to perch (so maybe there's a better spot for your bird) and mist the area right next to him, so he can lean in and out without feeling like he's being attacked by the water.   Keep trying, and if nothing works out, don't be alarmed. If he feels really gross he'll bathe himself in the water you normally set out, it's nothing unusual."

I contacted Conair and they told me none of their dryers have teflon. I use that and no problems. I agree that this bird looks pretty wet and coud use time by a heat lamp, makes my gut very happy after a shower and he doesn;t get chlled (at 20 yrs. old gotta be careful)"
cockatiel,3801ec,alber_t,12,Sun May 31 21:07:51 2015 UTC,Birds are probably similar to dogs where sometimes they pick at wounds until they make them worse. Dogs will lick and lick and lick and chew and chew cuts sometimes that they cause the wound to stay open and get worse and can even get infections. Please keep him coned or he may continue to pick at it.
cockatiel,3801ec,Solieus,14,Sun May 31 22:01:24 2015 UTC,I hope you will take him to an avian vet as soon as possible. An infection could cause him to lose a leg. You also need to find out why he did this to himself. Was he in pain with an undetected infection maybe. So sad! Please keep us updated.
cockatiel,3801ec,lotuslane,3,Sun May 31 23:39:36 2015 UTC,Hi alber_t I noticed you've posted again but no mention of what you are/will do to take care of your bird. Have you sought medical care?

cockatiel,3801ec,eposnix,3,Tue Jun 2 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"Next time a vet puts a cone on your pet, don't take it off till he says its okay."
cockatiel,3801ec,jessicamooney,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"I think he saved himself from getting a bad infection. I have a lovebird who got a really bad infected foot, and he had been to the vet and was being medicated. The vet was not optimistic, but after a very stressful touch and go week, he chewed his foot off and the day after he did it, he was fine. It happened when he was 4 years old, he just turned 11 and he has adapted to one legged life :)."

cockatiel,37ws9o,MirthSpindle,2,Sun May 31 01:26:42 2015 UTC,I love this. I gotta get me one of these branches. Thanks for sharing
cockatiel,37ws9o,alexjerez,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:45:54 2015 UTC,Cool! How did you recall train? I'd like to do that someday but mine haven't quite learned to fly.
cockatiel,37ws9o,squeekypig,1 point,Sun May 31 14:33:28 2015 UTC,"I started off with touch training with a clicker. When bird touches end of chopstick, I click and give treat.   To make bird used to my hand, I will touch train around my hand without moving my hand to gain hand trust.   Eventually, lure bird onto finger with chopstick. If she stands on finger, I give command, click, and give treat. Don't move hand at first. After a few times, move finger (with bird on it) before clicking and giving treat if bird is afraid of being on a moving hand.   Bird will learn that command - stepping up onto hand results in a treat. When bird learns to fly, teach bird to fly to hand from short distances first.   Also be sure the bird is food motivated before training sessions. If bird is a bit hungry, bird will be willing to work for food.   Tldr, clicker training. Check online for other guides too. I don't know if my way is the best."
cockatiel,37su53,ILiveInAVillage,3,Sat May 30 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"Looks like he broke a blood feather.  Possibly while flapping around during a night fright - mine did that once and splattered blood all over the inside of the cover.  I don't know what you should do next though, sorry.    If it's still bleeding call the vet immediately because he could bleed to death. Call the vet to see what you should do.  Not sure if you're supposed to pull out the broken feather or leave it to fall out on its own."
cockatiel,37su53,dogmatix101,2,Sat May 30 02:54:36 2015 UTC,It's not going to bleed to death :/
cockatiel,37su53,uber_kerbonaut,1 point,Sat May 30 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"It's not?  Then I will edit my comment.  I was told back when I first got our bird that the blood feathers were kind of an open tube and if they broke and didn't clot, the bird could lose a lot of blood and die."
cockatiel,37su53,dogmatix101,2,Sat May 30 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not too confident either. But this happened to my bird several times before I knew about styptic powder and the quantity of blood was never more than 2 or three drops for a clot developed. I think it's most important to catch the bird and treat it quickly, because if you aren't around they panic and flap the wing, which looks like it flings out more blood."
cockatiel,37su53,uber_kerbonaut,3,Sat May 30 17:38:35 2015 UTC,"My bird lost a lot of blood on one. It didn't break cleanly, it shattered near the base. Hurt him so much he was screaming and flapping spraying blood everywhere. I woke up from a nap to my boyfriend holding my bird, his hands and the bird were both covered in blood and when I calmed my bird down, two thick drops fell in my hand. I honestly thought he wouldn't make it. That he'd lost too much blood already.  We rushed him to a friend's house (I was shaking too hard to do it) and had them pull the feather. He recovered in a couple days. I'm pretty sure he would have died if we hadn't pulled it though."
cockatiel,37su53,freckled_porcelain,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah that seems to be it. Found the feather that broke.  It isn't still bleeding, I just don't know how to clean it because he doesn't like much more than a light spray and that isn't strong enough to clean the blood off."
cockatiel,37su53,Mako_chan,3,Sat May 30 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"You may want to go ahead and contact your vet. The dried blood on his wing isn't really an issue, but in my experience a broken blood feather can be painful and prone to bleeding again if it gets jostled around at all. Unless you feel comfortable removing the feather yourself I'd advise you to give the vet a call. If you want to remove it yourself try reading this first: http://www.cockatielcottage.net/feathers.html"
cockatiel,37su53,dogmatix101,1 point,Sat May 30 04:10:10 2015 UTC,He can clean it himself in the course of normal grooming.  I wouldn't worry about that too much.
cockatiel,37su53,theySEEmeTROLL1N,3,Sat May 30 05:10:15 2015 UTC,"I know you're getting a lot of suggestions to remove the feather, or have a vet do it, but I wanted to share my recent experience. Pumpkin broke a feather, and our vet said that since it clotted on its own to leave it in place. He only removes the stump of feather if it continues bleeding."
cockatiel,37su53,nonsensicalexis,2,Sat May 30 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"He/she (I don't know) is only about 6 months old. Spends lots of time out of his cage each day, always has food an water. Not sure what might have caused it."
cockatiel,37su53,VocePoetica,2,Sat May 30 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"Even if it's stopped bleeding, the blood feather that broke needs to be removed from the base.  If you haven't done it yourself before I would call a vet and have them do it."
cockatiel,37su53,uber_kerbonaut,1 point,Sat May 30 10:49:18 2015 UTC,Take him to the vet to get the blood feather removed. Birds are very susceptible to blood loss and will always try to hide any sickness or weakness. That blood feather has to be removed at the base for it to truly close up and heal.
cockatiel,37sipg,alber_t,5,Sat May 30 01:07:30 2015 UTC,If he has further injured himself you probably want to take him to the vet.  Something might get infected.
cockatiel,37sipg,IBiteYou,4,Sat May 30 02:09:34 2015 UTC,"Ya, you should call the vet. The cone won;t hurt him so you can leave it on, he will adjust."
cockatiel,37sipg,brad218,2,Sat May 30 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"Poor guy! Definitely consult the vet, and I'd put the cone back on to keep him from injuring it further.  Is it mean that I'd love to see a picture of a tiel sporting the cone of shame?"
cockatiel,37rz5a,NewayZ,2,Fri May 29 22:25:35 2015 UTC,"If that is the cage he lives in, it's an ok size, but not much stimulation/toys. He could be very bored. If you want a happy bird, you need to rearrange the cage and add a single new item at least once every 2 weeks."
cockatiel,37rz5a,freckled_porcelain,2,Mon Jun 1 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"We will get a bigger cage eventually, with some more job stability. He is really only in the cage at night, he gets to spend a lot of time out of his cage.  Okay, thanks for the tips. We try and rearrange it usually more than once a month, he usually hisses at the new things in his cage - we will just keep trying. :)"
cockatiel,37rz5a,freckled_porcelain,2,Tue Jun 2 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"To show you what I mean, here are two of my configurations. The top set is how his cage is now, the bottom is from a little while ago. Every time I rearrange, I take everything out, scrub the whole cage, put everything back in a  different configuration, and introduce one new thing. Cuts down on cage aggression too."
cockatiel,37rz5a,sporkafunk,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"Did the vet talk about behavior modification? In that you can't give him attention when he does this, it will encourage the behavior.   Also, the main reason pellets are supposed to be healthier is that the bird cannot choose to ignore seeds or food they don't like and therefore lack nutrition. If you believe nutrition may be a factor, you can add drops to his seed or water daily and this will supplement the diet.  Are you bathing him regularly? Is it particularly dry in your house? Air dryness could be a factor, maybe a humidifier wiuld help.  Unfortunately birds tend to be neurotic about things thay bother them and they will obsess over these details until it becomes an unbreakable habit.  Good luck! I hope Max feels better soon!"
cockatiel,37rz5a,freckled_porcelain,1 point,Sat May 30 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"We were giving him a vitamin supplement that came in a powder form that we would sprinkle on his seeds. He is still struggling with the pellets, but we will keep working with him.  He does get bathed quite regularly, usually with a sprayer because he hasn't quite figured out the bird bath. He really likes it, he knows where the sprayer is, and will sometimes let us know that's what he wants (some days the same day that we already gave him a bath).   Thanks for the tips! We will definitely work on the behavior modification - my wife really struggles when he chirps in pain, but we will definitely work on it!"
cockatiel,37rz5a,sanchoponcho,2,Tue Jun 2 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"Are you giving him seeds and pellets at the same time? Every bird ever will choose the seeds over the pellets. If you want to really switch him over, give him just pellets for the first half of the day, give a specific amount, and measure later to see if he ate any. Try to only offer seeds as treats, not mixed with pellets.  If he absolutely will not eat the pellets, you can give him his normal seed for 2 hours a day, but make sure it's not in the morning or early afternoon. They are most hungry then, and he'll be more willing to try the new food."
cockatiel,37rz5a,Colorguarder08,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"The breeder/cockatiel owner I got Sanchk from always asks me if he is doing this. He is no vet but he said that tiels will pluck their feathers when they're experiencing psychological issues such as depression. I dont know whether or not there is any scientific basis behind that but it could be worth looking into, maybe increase lighting near Maxi's cage, introduce more toys or possibly even another cockatiel of the same sex as a chatter partner."
cockatiel,37rvru,oesim,3,Fri May 29 22:00:06 2015 UTC,"You'll have to teach it. When your bird moves their head up and down try to reinforce the behavior with a click (if clicker training) or other forms of praise your bird enjoys followed by a treat such as some millet. After a while you can train in some audio cues like ""dance"" or ""shake it"" or even visual cues like a dance or nods similar to the birds dance.  Positive reinforcement is everything to our feathered friends!"
cockatiel,37rvru,sanchoponcho,1 point,Sat May 30 06:50:25 2015 UTC,I'll definitely try it!! Thank you. Unfortunately whenever I put on music he never really bobs his head in the first place....
cockatiel,37rvru,sanchoponcho,2,Mon Jun 1 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that you must wait for them to do it naturally. When they do praise, praise, praise, and reward with treats eventually your bird will begin doing it more often and you can try work in some visual or audio cues."

cockatiel,37on71,sanchoponcho,5,Fri May 29 04:39:30 2015 UTC,Wow! didn't you originally post some weeks ago that he flew away? Please give details of how he returned once you have enjoyed your  reunion. Good news!
cockatiel,37on71,lotuslane,8,Fri May 29 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"No, thats the sad thing too, it took me a mere 6 hours before brewking down. I love my little Sancho so much, I was just too quick to jump to conclusions and assumed the worst. Sancho was gone for close to 35 hours, when I realized I was looking at MY fluffball back home I was high on life. He sat there, feathers bedraggled, looking exhausted he hopped up to my finger and immediately initiated cuddle mode. When my family found him my brother said he sat at his food dish and ate for 30 minutes straight.  My aunt who babysits my sister was walking around with her outside and they heard Sancho whistling nearby, it looks as if he had been trying to make his way back home. He must have been confused because she found him finally sitting on a neighbors roof, a few houses down but he apparently recognized them and when he got off the roof he flew to them.  He is resting now, I noticed his voice was very hoarse which leads me to believe he flew farther than I originally thought and had been yelling quite a bit. Other than that though he seems fine, I plan on getting him a check up as soon as I get paid to check for any illness or parasites he may have gotten from other birds/being outside so long."
cockatiel,37on71,diggory_x,3,Fri May 29 07:01:56 2015 UTC,That is wonderful news. Good work to your family who managed to find him and good job to him for staying in the area and calling!
cockatiel,37on71,slyspectre,3,Fri May 29 11:34:08 2015 UTC,"Oh thank goodness, I am so happy for you two! I know both of those feelings and the one when you see them again is definitely the best. Here's to him getting plenty of rest!"
cockatiel,37on71,GredAndForgee,2,Fri May 29 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy for you! My cockatiel also flew away and spent a night out in the wilderness, but she returned home safely as well. Obviously didn't learn her lesson though, still tries to fly outside if anyone opens the door -_____-"

cockatiel,37nqrl,Kaggr,2,Fri May 29 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"moulting. Or...perhaps something has changed but you think it normal, like the sun beng brighter than normal due to season changes. Or maybe a weird sound outside. If you think it to be environmental, you may wanna cuddle with her more, show her you will protect her."
cockatiel,37nqrl,cacille,2,Fri May 29 07:36:46 2015 UTC,My bird is older but he does act weird/anti social some days. Almost like he's in a bad mood. Always seems to pass.
cockatiel,37nqrl,Misspissyoants,1 point,Fri May 29 23:41:55 2015 UTC,It's either molting or she's preparing to lay an egg. Our female became very isolationist when she began exhibiting nesting behavior.
cockatiel,37igkf,jcr4786,2,Wed May 27 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"The way I could tell my tiel (I brought him home at 9 weeks old) was male was that, within 3 weeks, he had started to whistle. I was badgering him with the wolf whistle to see if he'd repeated it, and he started to. I was wondering if he was a female until he started that, then I knew!   I think that's the best, earliest sign. Whether the bird just chirps, or whistles! :)"
cockatiel,37igkf,silverbastet,2,Wed May 27 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"While I mostly agree, vocal expressiveness doesn't always mean a boy. One of mine would always whistle and mimic the sounds around her, and we were sure she was a male because of this.  Said theory went out the window when she started laying eggs a few years down the line..."
cockatiel,37igkf,Randomixx,1 point,Thu May 28 08:32:50 2015 UTC,The 'wolf whistle' is close to a territorial call. Best to avoid it! Your bird will be much happier overall.
cockatiel,37igkf,CTYANKEE44,2,Wed Jun 10 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"Thank u guys he does whistle a little bit and chirps when he gets his head scritches, he's very smart and loves toys and playtime. My wife thinks it's a girl but I guess we will see what happens after the first molt. Thank u guys again for your time"
cockatiel,37igkf,LemonMagician,2,Wed May 27 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"Your bird is not a normal grey, so molting might not really help. My boy has female patterned tail feathers due to having a pretty color mutation. The only sure way to tell is a blood test, or if the birdy sings. You said he whistles, which means it's likely a boy. Mine started to repeat songs back to me at about 4 months. Pick a song (like part of the Andy Griffith theme song, or Imperial March) and whistle it multiple times a day excitedly to him/her. If it's a boy, he will likely start repeating it back at you within a few weeks, and then you'll know for sure. You'll also hear him practicing it when you're out of sight to make sure he has it right for you, which is really cute. :)"
cockatiel,37igkf,theySEEmeTROLL1N,2,Wed May 27 22:38:39 2015 UTC,I love hearing Pumpkin practice like that! So sweet!
cockatiel,37igkf,sanchoponcho,2,Thu May 28 11:46:31 2015 UTC,"Sancho used to whistle non stop when I was away but now he is talking and it is even cuter walking into that.   I stand by the door and crack it and listen and he sits there saying, Hi! Hello! Hi Sancho! Ohhhh Sancho! It is just so awesome to hear."
cockatiel,37igkf,vaqari,2,Fri May 29 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure without seeing the back, but here bird is just pearled, which is a sexually dimorphic mutation.  A male loses his pearls at first molt, whereas a female keeps hers for life."
cockatiel,37igkf,Ladytsun,2,Wed May 27 23:24:56 2015 UTC,"While this is generally true, my male is a pearl, and at two yrs old he still has his ""pearls"". He sings, talks, and makes love to my foot, so is definitely a male. My cinnamon pearl lost his pearls at the first molt, but not my grey pearl"

cockatiel,37igkf,caricamento,2,Wed May 27 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"Second this. Lots of people are saying you can listen to their song or watch for certain patterns/coloring. At this age, that's not possible. Even after your 'tiel has molted, the only way to make certain is to have a DNA test.   Here's what I did to make it as painless as possible... First obtain the blood sample test, which is basically a piece of paper. Get a pair of nail clippers, have somebody else hold the bird, and then clip 7 claws without drawing blood. On the 8th one, clip just enough to draw blood. It will heal very quickly and your tiel will forgive you.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatiel"
cockatiel,37igkf,NoUploadsEver,2,Thu May 28 13:45:52 2015 UTC,"There are some behaviors more prevalent to males and some to females, but they are not guarantees. There are some plumage types that are more common in one sex than another, but they are not guarantees. As far as I know both genders even masturbate the same way.  The only way to be 100% sure is with a blood test or if you notice the bird laid eggs."
cockatiel,37igkf,urgthrash,3,Wed May 27 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"How i can tell is if they sing or just cheep,  Females generally just peep and cheap in a consistent note. They also tend to be more cuddly and affectionate in my experiences . Males on the other hand sing, with whistles of varied tones and durations.  Males are also more likely to talk and learn things very fast.  Only sure fire way to tell is to take them to a avian vet and have a blood test.  You have a pretty bird regardless :)"
cockatiel,37igkf,theySEEmeTROLL1N,1 point,Wed May 27 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"Look up wing spot sexing. Nothing short of DNA is for sure, but I've found the spots to be accurate in the past."
cockatiel,37igkf,FriendsCallMeBatman,1 point,Wed May 27 23:41:55 2015 UTC,I'd say female... The cheeks look quite pale. On males at a young age the seem faded but get very very bright as they reach sexual maturity. We have a small male who had similar coloured cheeks at 10 weeks but they've gotten noticeably brighter and he's always working on his song and whistles. It's pretty cute listening to try and string weird chirps and sharp tones together.
cockatiel,37igkf,VocePoetica,2,Wed May 27 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"The cheeks aren't really and indicator. It is kind of a false bit of info that gets passed around because we normally assume males to be brighter in bird species. That particular rule isn't very clear for bred cockatiels any mor. The gene for it isn't sexually dimorphic. However, the pearl can be. If the bird loses much of the pearling in the first molt he's most likely a boy. My beautiful pearl girly has very bright orange cheeks and the original owner told my brother she was a boy. Though someone who traded her for drug money and never took good care of her maybe should be assumed to know nothing about her."
cockatiel,37igkf,FriendsCallMeBatman,1 point,Thu May 28 02:47:37 2015 UTC,Oooook we got told that by the vet... So I assumed maybe it was more accurate than the internet. Thanks for the additional info!
cockatiel,37igkf,VocePoetica,1 point,Thu May 28 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean it is very well correlated in the wild though or in wild types just breeding did some strange stuff. I got told something similar by a previous vet but the subsequent vets (and a couple breeders) informed me it really wasn't. Even the pearling is just an indicator. Unless your bird shows obvious sex characteristics (i.e. Eggs or mating behavior) surgical sexing and DNA seem to be the only sure fire method. The tail bars can be indicators too.   I thought my first girly was a guy a long time too until the eggs."

cockatiel,37igkf,uber_kerbonaut,0,Thu May 28 06:13:05 2015 UTC,Ok I will try that as well thank u so much
cockatiel,37igkf,Byeka,0,Wed May 27 22:49:11 2015 UTC,Vocalizations. Females will have one or two simple calls and males will have dozens and they are louder and vocalize more frequently.
cockatiel,37ilqh,sanchoponcho,3,Wed May 27 22:13:50 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the last direction he went and keep searching in that general direction. If he tends to be noisy, he might still be chirping for you, so make sure to be out or have someone aware of what a cockatiel sounds like. Let neighbors know what they sound like - they might hear him and be able to pass word along to you. If your feet get tired, try driving slowly around the area with the windows open.  I think most important is to not let the time that's passed discourage you. When Tybs got out it was 6 hours later that we finally found her. We could NOT see her, either, as she had chosen a pine tree to rest in, so sound is going to be important. Sancho might not have been chirping the last time you were out, but he may have taken a nap for a while, so continue keeping an ear out.  And something that surprised me - as loud as they are right next to your ear, that sound does not carry as far as you might expect. We found her three blocks from where she escaped, but we only heard her from half a block away. Letting neighbors know what to HEAR as well as what to look for can be helpful. The owner of the yard she was camped out in said he was wondering what kind of weird bird had been screaming in his tree for a couple of hours.  Unfortunately, from what I read, once the sun starts to set, they tend to get ready to roost, so if you still haven't found him by then you'll have to try again tomorrow. Call pet stores, vets, and put stuff up on local websites and craigslist. The pet store said it actually happens a lot, that someone will come in with a cockatiel they found, and it was proven because when I forgot to tell them I found Tybs, a woman called a week later having found a cockatiel. Keep searching, but get others involved in searching, and don't give up hope.  I'm keeping you and Sancho in my thoughts; good luck <3"
cockatiel,37ilqh,slyspectre,3,Thu May 28 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"Head out in that direction with friends and knock on every door, asking the home owner to contact you if they see your feathered friend. Ask them to call you rather than try to catch it if your birdie doesn't like strangers. Wander around the area listening closely for your birds usual chirps or whistles. Be sure to look on rooftops. If your little one likes someone's voice in your house, have that person wander around calling for it.  Best of luck!"
cockatiel,37ilqh,srccd,3,Wed May 27 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"Put the cage where he might possibly see it. Not give up, usually they circle around. Please keep us posted. So sad :("
cockatiel,37ilqh,Misspissyoants,1 point,Wed May 27 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, put his open cage outside with fresh food and water. Make sure it isn't on the ground, so he feels safer flying in to it. Hopefully he'll come home, but this has worked for me in the past."

cockatiel,37ilqh,iamanicellama,2,Thu May 28 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"In the event that Sancho is found does anyone know if there is such a device similar to a pigeon scroll or something that has retractable return information?   If/when he is found I plan on investing in an aviator harness and such a tag if available. Better yet, can a tiel be safely microchipped by a vet with some type of tracker?  Edit: The only thing preventing me from getting a harness was the lack of income as I have been unemployed the last 3 months."
cockatiel,37a21a,megsomatosis,8,Tue May 26 02:22:34 2015 UTC,it looks like he is nesting. Perhaps your knee is like an egg and kinda triggered this idea in his mind?
cockatiel,37a21a,cacille,6,Tue May 26 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"Is he just resting like that? It's hard to tell if he's holding still or not in the picture. Because that almost looks like he could be, well... mating with your leg if he's doing any wiggling back and forth. If he's just relaxing there then I'd say he just feels comfortable around you and is getting comfy."
cockatiel,37a21a,Mako_chan,3,Tue May 26 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"For context: my cockatiel, Chicken, is 16 years old. He has been doing this for a couple of years now. He will only do this on either myself or my fiance. He is healthy and happy otherwise. He does not rest on the bottom of the cage  -- which is common behavior for birds that are unwell.  We like to joke that this is just what he does when he gets super comfortable. But look at him..."
cockatiel,37a21a,HiddenSwan,1 point,Tue May 26 02:27:46 2015 UTC,My bird does like to nest at the bottom of his cage.  I dislike it though I have encouraged it by providing him an empty tissue box. :P

Both of my birds will melt on me like this and spread their wings out if I tickle them with a discarded tail feather. It must feel like mist from their bottle. Maybe Chicken's doing that?   They're both adorable, btw."

cockatiel,378e9o,Misspissyoants,2,Mon May 25 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed, mine just drinks a bunch of the water and gives himself the runs lol :P  I have tried taking him in the shower. It's weird, he loves the steam (he practically falls into a trance) but he doesn't like the getting wet part. Once in a while he will fluff up and I'll sprinkle some water on him but that usually only lasts a second and then he goes back to avoiding the water itself."
cockatiel,378e9o,Solieus,2,Tue May 26 00:42:16 2015 UTC,"I spray my birds. They nasty. A parakeet I had once would bathe at the kitchen sink. Ah, I miss that little blue guy."

cockatiel,375hg3,LemonMagician,2,Mon May 25 06:29:35 2015 UTC,It took a good minute or two to actually get it on him the first time. But he doesn't bite hard so I was able to do it with all my fingers attached lol. It's worth the try :3
cockatiel,375hg3,parrotpeep,3,Mon May 25 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"i got our cockatiel in one once, and even though it fit him all he could think of doing was chewing it off, so i took it off before he would destroy it!  hopefully your little guy(girl?) just has to get used to it, (s)he is far more tame than petey was"

cockatiel,372bge,cacille,2,Sun May 24 05:09:05 2015 UTC,"He is SO smart, looks like he has got some developing foot skills too! Develop them by giving him little toys he can hold and chew on. He looks so much like my bird but my girl isn't quite that level of smart."

cockatiel,3725n5,zzyxxy,7,Sun May 24 04:00:57 2015 UTC,One day both of mine somehow managed to get under the grate at the bottom of the cage and I walked in to find them just standing there under the grate.  It was really cramped and they seemed lost.  I had to take the grate out to get them out.  To this day I have no idea how they got there or what they were doing.
cockatiel,3725n5,pikachuuuuu,2,Sun May 24 04:13:40 2015 UTC,This made me laugh harder than it should have.
cockatiel,3725n5,MrNobody24,3,Sun May 24 05:24:59 2015 UTC,"My vote goes to you walking in on them planning how to take over the world! Haha but seriously, they where probably foraging on the floor of the cage (like my two are doing right now)"
cockatiel,3725n5,Ladytsun,5,Sun May 24 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, they were chewing a branch that has berries and must have been picking up what fell at the bottom. I still don't understand why they had to stop what they were doing and quickly climb back up, perhaps they were foraging out of shame."
cockatiel,3725n5,Ladytsun,2,Sun May 24 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"Mine do the same thing! Also works if I call their names, comes in handy when they have snuck off somewhere they shouldn't be"
cockatiel,3725n5,Areeane,3,Mon May 25 12:13:23 2015 UTC,That's hilarious lol and I agree that they were probably foraging. Most likely one of them started it and instinctively they all started doing it.
cockatiel,3725n5,uber_kerbonaut,1 point,Sun May 24 05:18:34 2015 UTC,Mine stayed on the bottom of the cage only when she had an egg to lay.

cockatiel,370lkc,janetplanet,2,Sat May 23 22:01:36 2015 UTC,It's like they can Obi Wan you into scritching them before you even realize you're doing it.
cockatiel,372q74,Tappyy,3,Sun May 24 08:47:39 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend waiting until you are done with college especially if you aren't sure what your future plans are yet.  You sound like you've put some thought and research into this and like you already kind of know cockatiels need stability and they do get very attached to their human.  They are very social animals and they need A LOT of attention.  Things can get very bad and your bird can suffer from depression, over preening, illness, behavior problems, screaming fits, etc... if they get too lonely or bored.  So I'd suggest get a cockatiel later when you've finished college and can give your bird a stable constant routine."
cockatiel,372q74,marge-bouvier,1 point,Sun May 24 10:37:03 2015 UTC,"I hate to respond to you so late but I just have a few more things I want to learn.  I'll be living in my own place and I can happily provide a cockatiel with the attention it needs.  As far as stability, it would stay at my place and probably fly back home with me for about three short periods of time (holidays and such) and during the summer if I go home.  How do Cockatiels handle airplane travel (in this instance about four hours long)?  I really don't want to jump into this but for reasons I don't really want to get into it's very important to me that I have a companion, from a therapeutic standpoint.  Someone else here said that just because I can get a pet, I shouldn't, and I ABSOLUTELY agree.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that, emotionally, this is really important to me.  So much so that I would abstain studying abroad if it meant a cockatiel would have a more stable environment.  I was planning on studying in Italy because I'm going into Classical studies and archaeology, but I'm also planning on getting my Masters and Doctorate so I'm sure I'll be spending a lot of time there in the future, and I would take the cockatiel with me for a more long term stay.  I'm in no rush, in fact I'll be going to Italy in a couple of weeks with my choir (first time in Europe, very excited!). Sorry, I'm not trying to give you my life story, I just want to talk to people with experience so I know the implications of what I am saying.  I'll be going to a couple of exotic bird stores downtown tomorrow to look around and ask some questions (not to purchase).  Is there anything in particular you think I should ask questions about?  You know, in addition to the kinds of questions I'm asking here.  Thank you all so much for your advice!"
cockatiel,372q74,marge-bouvier,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:41:57 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you are in no rush and I would still recommend you should get a cockatiel but I still think you should wait until you are done with your education and are settled before you do so.  Otherwise you and your bird may be left heartbroken if things don't work out. It's not a great idea to jeopardize your education or other opportunities that may become available to you now, when you can still have a cockatiel friend later after you are done with school and settled.  Your education goals are excellent, don't put them in jeopardy needlessly. Having a companion for therapy is important too.  There are many less exotic or hard to travel with animals that would make better companions if you need to have a companion for therapy reasons right now. I would never even try to attempt to put my cockatiel on an airplane, I know he would not handle it well, so I don't have a lot of answers on that other than I wouldn't want to put my bird through that once, let alone every holiday.  An example of how little it can take to stress out a cockatiel:  We moved 1 chair in our living room which was near his cage and our cockatiel had night terrors for 2 days. I would recommend if you are thinking that you will be able to take a cockatiel with you to Italy, you might want to reevaluate the idea. Read cacille's comment below, that is very good first hand advice. Finally, as for questions to ask the bird stores, general set up questions are a good idea but use caution in taking advice from them on whether or not you should get a bird, it of course depends on the store, but they are trying to sell you a product.  It might be a good idea to ask them for suggestions on which animals make good companion animals and handle air travel well. Good luck to you in whatever you decide."
cockatiel,372q74,cacille,3,Fri Jun 5 22:16:46 2015 UTC,"I would SO wait. Finish college first. Just because you CAN get a pet does not mean you should. Six hours alone? No prob for a well adjusted bird. But going overseas? Op, I am LIVING that nightmare right now. Check my recent post in parrots subreddit. It is hell being away from my bird this long. An option of course is to bring bird with you. the process of moving a bird overseas is financially painful and paperwork and hoops you would not believe. I have got most of it detailed on my blog for future crazy parronts like myself, but i am going to be truthful here, my current plan may kill my bird if this country does not allow her in.   If you are going overseas just for a few months, keep in mind your bird may become depressed and you may not have internet access to see your bird via skype. I am lucky enogh to have BAD internet to skype with my bird sometimes. Basically....wait. Just wait."
cockatiel,372q74,cacille,1 point,Sun May 24 11:53:32 2015 UTC,"Just replying to this because I'd like to ask you the same question I wrote above (it's long so I won't post it again).  Really honestly and truly, thanks so much for your time!"
cockatiel,372q74,budgiebum,2,Fri Jun 5 10:45:33 2015 UTC,"I  am unable to answer that right now, but i can answer your question pretty deeply. My bird has been on 5 flight. 2 overseas. BUT... Do not assume anyting. Anyway i will respond in mre detail when i am able to access a computer."
cockatiel,3718fh,banditbananas,2,Sat May 23 22:35:11 2015 UTC,"Sancho likes my wooden bed post. He loves to tear bits off of the corners. Find (bird safe) items that she likes to bite and plop them in her cage. My understanding is that it is a sort of foraging/beak maintenance thing. When Sancho is out of his cage and starts chewing things up I just find a similar item and put it in his cage, when he needs cage time he usually will walk around tearing up said items.   As for finger nails, Sancho is the same. He will bite my nail and try to crack it. If I move my finger and he keeps trying to do it I just put him on my shoulder and after a minute or two he usually forgets."
cockatiel,3718fh,sanchoponcho,1 point,Sat May 23 23:57:50 2015 UTC,I'll be sure to try that. She just loves to tear things up so I just bought her a nice little safe to eat toy to mess up. Hope that works.

Well, yesterday she decided to also sleep at the bottom of her cage, so ended up going to a different vet that could see me that day.  Everything looks fine so far, some drops to give her, and I need to keep an eye out. Also, got some stuff for misting and adding to her water to help with the preening too. Will know some of the results today or tomorrow and I need to keep an eye on her for the foreseeable future just in case."

cockatiel,35w6sf,Zedkan,3,Thu May 14 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"Just let him sit near you - or on your shoulder, calmly. You LEFT him. Think about it as a relationship with a girlfriend. You left her and she was alone for 5 months with no word from you. Any self respecting girl would move on and then, upon your return, give you the cold shoulder for a while. Now of course, he is a bird and can't do phone calls nor understand English, so of course there was nothing you can do about the situation, but it is up to you to repair it slowly and calmly.   Talk to him. Let him sit near you. Or on you if he lets you do that. Sit for hours, play on your computer or whatever. Don't touch him. Talk sweetly to him. Look at him and call him whatever sweet names you do. When he is nice and comfy with you again, then take the next step forward to letting him come onto your hand or whatever he usually used to do. Take it slow...and talk to him. It helped my bird handle all the stress of moving, USDA quarantine, etc because I talked to her about it prior. Got her used to the cage and traveling around town a bit. She has been flourishing without me, because of that (We had been together 10 years).   Hope this helps a lot."
cockatiel,35w6sf,cacille,2,Thu May 14 03:56:30 2015 UTC,Thank you. But I cannot even get him out of the cage. It's bad.   And I know I hurt him. I just want everything to get better.
cockatiel,35w6sf,cacille,2,Thu May 14 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"Sit next to him with the cage door open. Offer treats outside the cage. Say ""Sorry boy, I know I was gone a long while. I go to college now. I was at college."" Show him pictures of college. Will a bird understand this? Of course not. But you are spending time with him and he may want that connection back with you just as badly, but it might take weeks.   If possible, if there is someone else in the family he comes out of the cage for, let them take him out and put him on your shoulder or whatever. Then you can reward him with a treat and just sit quietly with him."

cockatiel,35t91j,charms2288,1 point,Thu May 14 04:46:50 2015 UTC,I was just about to ask the same thing
cockatiel,35t91j,Richards345,1 point,Thu May 14 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"He spends some time on the bottom but I keep his mirrors and bells to words the middle along with his food and millet by the upper part of the cage, he works his way around the entire cage that way. He likes to go on the bottom to forage for fallen seeds but he doesn't spend long periods of time there"
cockatiel,35t91j,charms2288,1 point,Thu May 14 11:02:14 2015 UTC,Nice. I have a second cage for him in the living room and I have to keep his mirrors in there. If I keep them in the cage he sleeps in he gets too protective over it lol.
cockatiel,35qdtf,cutehulhu,3,Tue May 12 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"Heh. He's so adorable and poofy.  Do you wear any jewelry or paint  your nails? I find my birds absolutely hate nail polish with a passion. I have no idea why, but all but one of them will bite me if I have painted nails and try to touch them (the one that doesn't is old man Henry, and it takes a lot to scare him). Maybe it makes nails look like scary bugs or something.  I do have a female that though she will step up on a stick, she will not let me touch her at all. She's a skittish girl, and I think it's at least in part just her personality. I haven't found anything that works with her yet. Unfortunately it has caused some issues when I absolutely need to pick her up and can't do it easily, so I can understand why you're concerned.   Does he have any favourite toys or other favourite treats that you might try? The only other thing I can think of is just standing quietly with your hand in the cage for a bit each day. If hands become a normal part of his cage it might make them less scary.  Birds are so weird with what they're afraid of :/"
cockatiel,35qdtf,DrsansPhD,1 point,Tue May 12 20:47:25 2015 UTC,"Pierrots favorite thing to do is poof up and show off! I don't wear nailpolish or jewelry on my hands, but it's good to know. I have tried to get him to step up on a stick, he will do it when millet is involved but he seriously hates the stick more than my hands! It also didn't take him long to figure out that my hands were holding the stick.  I will keep trying to involve my hands in his daily life. Maybe over time he will be nicer to them...! Thanks for your reply!"
cockatiel,35qdtf,fugufugufugu,1 point,Tue May 12 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"My cockatiel has a similar problem. I usually use a glove to get her out of the cage. Once she's good and perched on my hand she is comfortable enough. I have essentially given up on getting her to let me pet her and scratch her head. Although, I have found she becomes extremely snuggly when I take her in the shower with me and she will nuzzle under my neck to warm up when we step out. Sometimes she will even let me stroke her with my fingers when she's relaxed in a nice warm shower. Otherwise, as an older rescued bird with a mysterious and probably traumatic past, I haven't been able to fix all her weird idiosyncrasies and don't expect to. We find other ways to bond."
cockatiel,35qdtf,cacille,1 point,Tue May 12 23:26:36 2015 UTC,"Many birds just do not ""get"" hands. They are like snakes coming at them. If you do manafw to get Pierrot onto a hand, do the step up game, rewarded with millet conveniently hanging nearly (dont use your hands to pick up the millet. Instead bring him to it with your arms frozen in place, turning your body). Play step up until he understands the game really well and is ok with your hands in the game position. Later you  can change the game a bit in other ways so he can learn that hands are ok in multiple patterns."
cockatiel,35qdtf,ffSdCnJD,1 point,Wed May 13 08:14:02 2015 UTC,"As soon as I try putting my hands closer though, he will lunge and hiss. He hasn't bitten me, but it's only a matter of time. He's given me plenty of warning taps ...   From this part it seems to me you are retreating your hand(s) as if you are afraid of the bite. This reinforces in the bird's mind the hiss and taps are working as he wants. You might want to completely ignore his protests and keep your hand there so he will eventually give up. It requires patience but I'm sure he'll learn."
cockatiel,35qkbu,WolfLink_,2,Tue May 12 18:14:51 2015 UTC,"They will fall off. Give them time. Birds don't ALWAYS lose their feathers in pairs.

cockatiel,35njcm,Dreaming_In_Ink,3,Tue May 12 02:07:08 2015 UTC,Quick tip for new owners: Don't fall asleep with your tiel. You may roll over on them or something. It's one of the top causes of accidental death in pet birds. Please make sure they are far from you and can't reach you before you pass out. You don't want to wake up to that.

I have an irn and a tiel that get along great together, after about 6 months of hissing and lunging at eachother. they live in the same cage and will get a little pissy if we move them close together without them wanting it.  with tiels, they tend to like to live in large groups. they should start to get along sooner rather than later. we've had a few tiels that took a while to get used to each other. just dont leave them alone together as some pretty nasty confrontations can come up.. They'll sort it out soon, just keep on mediating and letting them know that you're all friends that can trust eachother."
cockatiel,35jtmj,narufry,1 point,Mon May 11 04:52:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Haha   We found that they only really have a throw down. When they somehow unexpectedly find that they are really close to one another.   6 months sounds like a good time let them get used to each other.  It's been just over a month now. I am hesitant as to what would happen if they were in the cage alone while we were working.   We've also been educated on how to prep the cage when we move them. To clean it totally,  Move everything around. Put in be toys and finally move the Cage to a different part of the house so they think it's a brand new neutral cage."
cockatiel,35jtmj,narufry,1 point,Mon May 11 06:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yep thats the idea! It's better that you have two males too, as a female can be very territorial about their cages. (did I already say this?)   anyway good luck! I hope it all goes smoothly for Bruce, Roger, and you."
cockatiel,35jtmj,narufry,1 point,Mon May 11 07:45:43 2015 UTC,Nah you're good! In terms of a food bowl and water bowl when we move them should we give them two of each? or just bigger ones?
cockatiel,35jtmj,narufry,1 point,Tue May 12 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"i'd give them two of each, definitely. we had a bossy tiel who would just sit on the food bowl all day."

cockatiel,35b3hr,feeblemedic,1 point,Fri May 8 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"I recommend you don't let them breed at least not now. There are several things you should know BEFORE breeding. To keep them from breeding best thing to do is put them in separate cages and let them have their out of cage time separately so they can't breed at all. Also with the female cover her cage at night make sure she has no more than 10 hours of sunlight to trick her body into thinking it's winter and breeding is bad. Also rearrange her cage and move it to a separate area. Birds will only breed when they feel they have found a safe place to nest. Take that away by moving them and rearranging their cage and it should stop. Also remove ALL materials that can be used for a nest including but not limited to shreddable toys, paper, hay (if you give it to your birds)  Since you don't know how to hand feed them my suggestion is DON'T. Let the parents feed/raise them just handle them a lot from the time they are about 2-3 weeks old. Hold one at a time and once they start shivering put them back. There are SOOOOOOOOOOOO many ways to kill a chick hand feeding it that I honestly wouldn't risk it with the first clutch. Read up on it talk to breeders in your area and see if they are willing to show you how it's done."
cockatiel,358zjl,ChiquititoPollito,1 point,Fri May 8 02:40:52 2015 UTC,"What kind of ""nest"" do you have? That might have something to do with it. I have a similar situation with my male who is 19 yrs. old. A couple of years ago we started to let him spend time in a paper bag on my son's bed (at first to play then he appeared to like to rest there he got territorial but was still sociable after time away from it) He never pooped in it but we took him out and he'd do his business then. At night he'd be back in his cage on his perch and his droppings would go through the grate, no problem. In the last 6 months he went blind from cataracts (not diet related, he's been on pellets for almost his entire life, cockatiels tend to get cataracts) and we transferred him to a custom made spacious glass cage we had from a special needs cockatiel we had. He has a little hut that he loves. At night we take it out so he perches and poops. During the day when we are at work however, he likes to stay in his hut and he will not poop while in the glass cage with the hut.  He can hold it for hours. It isn't for more than 4 hours cause I come home for lunch to check on him. His reluctance to poop while not on a perch started with his time resting in the bag and now with his hut. I told our avian vet and she said that they can hold it for a time and it shouldn't be a problem. I don't like the idea of him not voiding for some hours during the day but he has regular check ups and full blood work etc and is healthy. He was stumbling in his old cage and he is much safer now in his modified cage. He spends a lot of time out of it with us when we are home and like yours he voids then frequently. I am just wondering what type of nest do you have? Is it a nesting box?"
cockatiel,358zjl,lotuslane,1 point,Fri May 8 06:10:50 2015 UTC,"thanks for answering! the nest, if you google ""open canary nest"" it looks just like that. there have been times when he doesn't have one anymore, because either he'll shred it or poop in it too much that it's time to get a new one. at those times he'll sleep on his swing perch and his poop will land onto the paper towels lined over the grate.   he doesn't have a hut but one of his favorite things is to go to one corner of his cage and start shredding up the paper towels, or roam around underneath the paper towels like he's caving or burrowing. i assume that's some sort of nesting behavior, as with your cockatiel and his paper bag/hut? and so that's why he'll not poop in his cage?"
cockatiel,358zjl,lotuslane,1 point,Fri May 8 10:32:05 2015 UTC,"I googled open canary nest. Does he get very dirty when he poops in it? I think that he may be using his cage as a nest if he is burrowing under paper towels and has this nest. Do you put the towels there to keep the grate clean? I'd refrain from doing that. You may try moving away from the canary nest but he'll need something to give his old feet a rest. There is a sundeck that I've seen that people have covered with fabric to make it more comfortable: http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?pcatid=8367     As I've mentioned my avian vet said they can hold their poo for long periods and it's not a problem but I know how you feel. I don't like the idea. We tend to dote on our old little guy, he's very precious to us especially because our son has grown up with him. Good luck!"
cockatiel,358zjl,Misspissyoants,1 point,Sat May 9 18:30:21 2015 UTC,Our tiel has a shoebox (long story) that he won't poop near. I think it's a nesting thing. He will hold it til he's away from there and then when he lets rip it's like a dog turd! Well ok not that bad but he does seem to be protective of it that way.   We also notice some watery stools when eating veggies.
cockatiel,357f8m,aryat1989,3,Thu May 7 18:59:09 2015 UTC,Is he molting? They preen more when molting.  Also do you allow him to bathe or shower regularly ? If not he may be uncomfortable with dried skin (down).
cockatiel,357f8m,diggory_x,1 point,Thu May 7 21:35:14 2015 UTC,He's just finishing up a molt. He gets a decent bath about 6 days a week but its more like a misting. Around once a week he will get really into it and get himself pretty soaked.

cockatiel,356wkh,whineybirdy,5,Thu May 7 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"If he is indeed only 1 month 4-5 weeks, he is WAY too young to be weaned properly. Tiels normally should be with their breeder/parents until a minimum of 8 weeks in my book. Longer if they're weaning late for some reason."
cockatiel,356wkh,Faithwynn,2,Thu May 7 18:24:38 2015 UTC,let me make sure on the age... are there any diagrams that show how cockatiels look as they grow???
cockatiel,356wkh,Faithwynn,1 point,Thu May 7 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any visual charts off the top of my head. Does he looked to be fully feathered or are some feathers still looking like he has something almost like a plastic on them at the base? I'm looking for pin feathers if you're familiar with the term.  They'll feel like there's something hard at the base where the feather hasn't ""bloomed"" out to be fully fluffy on a newly grown feather.  What kind of diet is he on? If it's a seed diet is he able to crack seeds easily or does he look like he's having a hard time learning? Try getting in some veggies like dark green lettuce, oranges, or apples. Even a cooked egg or a little cooked rice/noodles is good for them. Something easier to eat or that you can offer in your hand might satisfy the begging.  Keep track of how much he's eating as best you can, it may be he's force weaning because he's not being fed by a parent like he is expecting."
cockatiel,356wkh,twolips,2,Thu May 7 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"he is fully feathered and soft and has no pin feathers right now.  he mostly eats seeds but likes to play with cilantro, he can eat on his own just fine (cracking the seeds).  i'll definitely try to give him more greens or the other suggestions!  thanks"
cockatiel,356wkh,DrsansPhD,3,Thu May 7 21:46:20 2015 UTC,"The breeder shouldn't have given him away at that age; he's too young. If he is eating, he might be doing it for attention and it's just something that he will eventually grow out of. I had a baby come to me like that, and the crying will last a couple weeks. It's best to have a vet do a check-up to make sure there aren't any other issues."
cockatiel,356wkh,DrsansPhD,2,Thu May 7 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"he eats plenty and his poops are healthy looking (some are quite huge, but for the most part normal sized)"
cockatiel,356wkh,zionxgodkiller,2,Thu May 7 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"If you can, give the baby back to the breeder for at least a month. If they are willing to continue feeding it.

cockatiel,356wkh,DrsansPhD,2,Thu May 7 19:23:54 2015 UTC,how is it starving if it is constantly shitting (some massive turds)
cockatiel,356wkh,MirthSpindle,2,Thu May 7 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"Because it's too young to be weaned. It may be getting some seed, but it is not getting enough nutrients to sustain itself. Have you been weighing it at all?"
cockatiel,356wkh,srccd,2,Thu May 7 20:52:12 2015 UTC,This is true. Seeds alone are not enough to support a babys diet. If the breeders will not take him back you need to get baby formula for cockatiels or something for their size and syringe feed him.
cockatiel,356wkh,happycheese86,2,Thu May 7 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"my estimate of a month was wrong, it's more like two.  I haven't weighed him yet"
cockatiel,356wkh,silverbastet,2,Thu May 7 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"That's a bit better, though for future reference most decent breeders keep the baby until 11-12 weeks.   Babies will also regress when they go to their new home. It's normal. Mine made the whiny noise for a few months (he's a bit special). You can offer hand feeding formula on a spoon if the babys weight goes down too much (I highly recommend getting a kitchen scale and weighing him) but I honestly wouldn't worry about it unless that happens."

When I got him I didn't have school or work and as school has become more demanding I am finding that I have less and less time for him. When school is over I feel the issue will only become worse when I get a job and I'll maybe have 4-5 awake hours at home.  Also I'll be moving to Canada and they seem to have a lot of rules and regulations you have to go through to bring a bird over. I honestly don't want to put that kind of stress on the both of us.

It seems like either they're banned and that's it or you have to go to extreme lengths to do it successfully."
cockatiel,3543mk,cacille,1 point,Thu May 7 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's something that is temporary though, until the bird flu epidemic is eliminated in Washington and the 11 other currently affected states. One state has recently been taken off the list though, so it could only be a few months or year until the issue is resolved, hard to know.   Other than that, I see your issue with time, just didn't want you to think that it was totally impossible to move a bird internationally. Right now it is for you, but tis a temp thing."

cockatiel,3531ff,vaqari,2,Wed May 6 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am not a vet.  Did you ask your vet about possible therapy options for strengthening her feet?  You might be able to do some physical therapy to help her with mobility and such.  I know some techniques used with nestlings, but not adult birds.  Re-breaking and re-setting the toe might be another option.  I'd ask your vet if there's anything that can be done to help her dexterity and strength in that foot, and perhaps get a second opinion if that vet doesn't know of anything.  Did you go to a certified avian vet?  In the meantime, she might appreciate platform perches if she has trouble perching.  Make sure to have a variety of perch widths and materials as well, so that her feet get good exercise.  If she has mobility problems, looking into some setups for disabled birds might be helpful.  How does she fly?  I have two cockatiels now that have trouble flying (one clipped before fledging, the other neglected for years), and I can give you some tips with more info.  Does she have all her flight feathers, or is she clipped?  One thing that helps with very clumsy birds is having them fly to somewhere they can safely crash-land--encouraging them to fly to a treat on a bed, for example."
cockatiel,3531ff,vaqari,1 point,Wed May 6 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"I had another thought--amputating the bad toe might also be an option.  It looks as if it's interfering with her other toes, and if she can't move it at all amputation might be a good option."
cockatiel,3531ff,vaqari,1 point,Wed May 6 20:38:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you. You've given me hope that something can be done, so we've got an appointment with a different vet on Tuesday. They've made me fill in a huge questionnaire of bird questions (including information on her diet and cage and things) which suggests they know what they're doing."
cockatiel,3531ff,vaqari,2,Fri May 8 17:58:58 2015 UTC,I'm glad!  I hope they find a solution!
cockatiel,3531ff,jessicamooney,1 point,Fri May 8 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"We're back! She wasn't too bad on the way there, because we listened to all her favourite songs, including ""before he tweets"" by Carrie Underwood, and ""born to be my birdie"" by Bon Jovi.  When we were in the waiting room, I gave her a pot of water as it was quite warm in the car. She decided to throw it EVERYWHERE and because she was in a box it wasn't even waterproof. So she left a puddle on the chair and floor.  When we went through, the vet was lovely. I'd filled in the online form so had briefly mentioned Crumble's issues, but I'm unsure if it down to that because she seemed genuinely nice! She didn't try to do anything to upset or stress Crumble. Crumble even agreed to be weighed (well, she stepped on the scales without realising) and is 90g.  Crumble has been told she isn't allowed to eat so much millet. I've bought her some seed sticks that are enriched with vitamins and she's tired eating those, and I've got some vitamin drops for her water but I don't think she'll like it.  But the vet did say she thinks Crumble's issues are mostly in her head, as she shouldn't be struggling so much just because of one bad toe."

cockatiel,3535mi,throwawayokbay,5,Wed May 6 18:39:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the little guy.  Birds hide illnesses very well; he could have been sick the entire time.  I know from personal experience that birds can go from ""apparently fine"" to ""dead"" in under 24 hours.  Taking the bird to a vet when he showed signs of illness would have been the best thing to do, but he might not have been able to be saved at that point.  A possibility is he may have already been starving when you found him.  Birds can't go long without food, and he probably had no idea how to forage wherever you live.  His digestive system may have started to shut down, causing the new food he ate to rot in his stomach.  Nothing you would have known about unless you'd had experience rescuing birds before."

cockatiel,3535mi,budgiebum,2,Wed May 6 19:13:22 2015 UTC,I second the above post. Thank you for trying to save him. Birds are pretty delicate and really do hide being sick. You did your best for him.

cockatiel,350nbn,cutehulhu,1 point,Wed May 6 07:30:52 2015 UTC,Just a quick question as well for other owners. Has anyone here kept primary tail/wing feathers after a molt and made anything from it? Or is it something that is considered a health risk or just kind of unsanitary.
cockatiel,350nbn,cutehulhu,1 point,Wed May 6 03:04:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, indoibt it's unsanitary if your bird is healthy. I kept a few pretty tail feathers and stuck them in a swing i got for Pierrot. I often saw him playing with the feathers he lost and figured he'd like it."

cockatiel,34w8ct,Lyfalufapus,3,Tue May 5 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"I seem to be in the minority every time this question is asked, but I work full time and have a happy tiel.  I get up early enough to have him out of the cage first thing in the morning for about an hour. When I get home, he gets another hour of direct play time, plus he'll hang out with me for whatever time I have left as I'm doing chores and stuff before his bed time. I've found that the biggest struggle working and owning a tiel is adjusting so that they are put to bed for a full 12 his, while still getting enough interaction and simulation. Since I sometimes work evenings, this might mean I come home, spend time with him, put him to bed, then go back out to work that evening.  Other things I do to keep him happy include switching up his cage arrangement and rotating toys in and out frequently so he always has something new to explore. I also try to teach him a new song to whistle every few months.  When I go out of town, some times I'll bring him along in a travel cage, other times I have a friend that he stays with. His vet also has a spot for boarding a bird. I haven't had to use that, but I like knowing that it's an option."
cockatiel,34w8ct,theySEEmeTROLL1N,1 point,Wed May 6 11:49:24 2015 UTC,When you say travel do you mean regular travel for work? If that is the case being in a single household it would not be practical. You can not leave them alone. Also when considering finances remember that they need to go to the vet once a year for check ups since they mask their illnesses until it is too late. REgular check ups then mean an office visit of around $65 plus tests that can run a couple of hundred dollars or more. In terms of working all day that would be a lonely life for a cockatiel. They are flock animals. I think it would be better to get two. You can get advice from an avian rescue organization in your area. I think if you start with one they will bond with you so that when you get the other even if they bond with each other then one will be more likely to enjoy your company. Good luck

cockatiel,34e0z8,Misspissyoants,3,Thu Apr 30 12:36:47 2015 UTC,Adorable!  Does Chandler go nuts about pokemon like Strat? Strat insists I only play it when he can watch. :P
cockatiel,34e0z8,Malted_Shark,2,Thu Apr 30 19:46:06 2015 UTC,Chandler is the same :) he sulks when he's in his cage and one of us is playing without him. It's the same with any game or controller haha! I love their willingness to be involved 110%

cockatiel,34du45,diggory_x,2,Thu Apr 30 10:10:27 2015 UTC,"Our tiel is busy monitoring his various areas of ownership around the house. Hears the beard trimmer? That's his area, he needs to help with that. Rustling a bag? Potential snack! Give here! Opening a carbonated beverage? Beer on the stoop, well don't mind if I do! Running a tub? It's shower time. Surfing the web with your laptop? Well, cuddle time in that special spot by the crook of your knee and the warm laptop. Taking a nap?  Well I'll join you but then I must groom those wayward hairs on your face. Laundry room? Put me on my basket there so I can look out the window and chew things. Coronation street theme? Flock, come watch!!!  I could go on but I think you get the idea üòú"

Sometimes he'll just step all over them cos he likes the texture. They're his favourite thing!   My other 'tiel loves to just sit on my head. It's her favourite place.

I can be holding one half of a sandwich with the other in full access on the plate,  but they will still try and stand all over that in their attempts to get the bit I'm holding.

cockatiel,34du45,maddieface,1 point,Fri May 1 07:21:15 2015 UTC,Mine seems to be convinced that everything she does is wrong. So if I hold the toast she knows she's allowed the toast. But if I don't hold the toast she might not be allowed.

I hadn't even opened up the door when it finished and he was about ready to launch himself off my shoulder and into the microwave just to get at those eggs. Crazy birb. And yes, he got lots of eggs when it cooled enough. And then tried to eat the egg that was stuck on the side of the bowl when I finished!"

He will clink around his cage to let me know he is ready to be uncovered.   Around 8 am he will yell at me until I let him out. He partakes in my morning feast even if it means taking the occasional spill into my cereal bowl. He would usually serenade my female chihuahua that he had a crush on, now however he no longer likes her. He LOVES feet, I play a game (of thrones) with him since he will bow to my foot 9 times out of 10 and make comments like ""bow my subject and rise as Sir Sancho"""

I feel really bad for birbs that dont have owners who fully understand what they need to do to look after birds, even if they have the best intention. it only takes 5 seconds to google what you need for a bird. if its too expensive to buy a big cage... dont get the bird..  We built an outside aviary for our irn and tiel that's six meters long 1.8 deep and .8 high. it cost less that a good sized bird cage.. it might be a bit extravagant but it's a lot nicer than them being stuck in even a large cage all day while we're out.."
cockatiel,34co9o,baconpieguy,2,Thu Apr 30 04:23:21 2015 UTC,"How much would you say is ""a lot"" of hot water?  A litre?  Gallon?  Just want to be sure!  I've made my own household cleaner in the past by soaking lightly salted citrus peels in white vinegar for 3 weeks.  Do you think that would be sufficient?  I certainly haven't had any issues in the past, but it's always good to check in with others and their experiences."
cockatiel,34co9o,baconpieguy,2,Thu Apr 30 07:47:48 2015 UTC,"The entirety of whatever bucket you are using to clean the cage. It really doesn't matter as long as the bleach is pretty diluted and the smell is not too strong. If you are uncomfortable with that, use apple cider vinegar or white vinegar for the same results, although you would have to use a little more than a cap full."

cockatiel,34a00t,aishadorable,3,Wed Apr 29 14:09:20 2015 UTC,Congratulations on your little one! Strongly Suggest you put other perches besides dowels in there for foot health. Don't have a link about it but you can find one on-line. They love manzanita for example. They are on their feet 24/7 if you think about it. Also a sun deck is nice when they want to rest their feet. Good luck and well wishes on a long and happy life together!
cockatiel,34a00t,lotuslane,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:11:35 2015 UTC,Are the dowels the plain wooden ones? Right after I shot the video I bought a larger pumice perch for him and I'm about to buy one of those large sand perches since they are on sale. Are those good for birds? He's had that small blue pumice perch since he was a baby and that's all he sits on haha he loves it. And I don't know what a sun deck is but he likes to sleep on top of the nesting box in there does that count? Thanks for the advice!
cockatiel,34a00t,shorthurrdontcurr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:53:17 2015 UTC,"The plain wooden ones are dowels, yes. Please avoid sand perches--they can rub their feet raw, and it's dangerous for them to swallow the grit. Pumice is good, and my tiel loves rope perches! Try to get different diameter perches so his feet aren't locked in one position all the time. A flat surface like the top of the nesting box is good too!"
cockatiel,34a00t,shorthurrdontcurr,1 point,Tue May 5 21:06:15 2015 UTC,"I just installed a rope perch and it's their absolute favorite. And they still love the pumice. They have a small pumice and a big pumice, and also an Edi-Perch they love to nibble on. And I actually removed the nesting box because I'm convinced my new 'tiel is a girl and I want none of that copulating, but I put a corner perch in it's place and they like that okay. But most of their time is spent on the rope. Any other ideas for a flat surface instead of a nesting box?"
cockatiel,34a00t,diggory_x,2,Thu May 21 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"My tiel loves his rope perches too! The least obtrusive flat surface would probably be a flat corner platform. You can buy one, or rig one out of a triangle of bird-safe wood. Or you could put a sufficiently large block on the bottom of the cage. Whichever option you choose, try to avoid anything with sharp corners that could injure your birds if they fall."

cockatiel,348m4p,ladiamante,2,Wed Apr 29 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"So sad to hear :( I really sympathize, as I had a similar experience a few years back with a beautiful boy that we found in a chicken coop and adopted. I commented on one of your earlier posts with the advice that our vet gave us at the time, but the same vet also told us that it was sadly normal for birds adopted from the wild to have disorders from their time out in the wild- dirty water, eating bad food, etc. It sounds like even if you're not sure of her age that Lady had a long life and you sound like an incredible bird mamma, so please know that there's no reason for you to feel guilt. Its ok to be devastated and feel grief- our pets are part of our family and those bonds are so important. It sounds like she passed peacefully and she had a really good life with you, and I'm sure you'll eventually remember this too. I know this doesn't make it any easier, but please know that my thoughts are with you."
cockatiel,348m4p,realhumanbabby,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss. don't let guilt get to you, it sounds like you're a kind caring person who tried all you could, its not your fault there were no vets near enough to help you.  It's nice that she didn't have to suffer in her last moments. maybe she was having a nice dream about that great honey bar and her favorite humans who looked after her despite her troubles.  I'm making myself cry. I had a lovebird who died last year and i still sometimes feel like it was my fault or i could have done something to help. She was old, and happy and fat, and I know she had a good time with us. I was distraught for a few weeks then it slowly got easier. Don't try to hold your emotions in, let them out, remember the good times you had, think about how shes no longer in pain.  Your last paragraph is so sad but so true, and so beautiful. It's a good thought to have, we adore our pets and often share our deepest and fondest kinds of love with them. And its great, they deserve every second of it, they're sweet gentle souls, their whole lives revolve around us and even though they're tiny and fragile they trust us so much with their tiny little bodies and their short but happy lives.  I'm gonna go home tonight and give some personal attention to my birds and all of my other animal babies, and think positive thoughts for your Lady."

cockatiel,346ds8,meredith_ks,2,Tue Apr 28 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Unless you see something in their nose that is sticking out, or bloody, don't touch it. They do have these flaps that looks like something is blocking their breathing. I made that mistake too when I got my first tiel, but did no damage to him. I got lucky haha. Then I started working with all types of aviary animals and I realized my mistake. If the nostril looks swollen also, which may happen if there is something blocking his nose, vet immedietly."

cockatiel,346ds8,meredith_ks,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, that looks normal. There is always some natural tissue in their nares.

cockatiel,346ds8,Monkeyninja24,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"We would need to see a picture. A lot of times it looks like something is in there, but there is not. If your tiel is scratching his nose /sneezing a lot, then yes he is trying to get something out. Try to take it out if you can. You don't need to spend a heaping amount of money just yet. If it looks worse in an hour or 2, take him to the vet. Right now we can't say anything though, because there is no picture .-."

Both of them were on my knees today demanding head scratches.

cockatiel,3433kw,Monkeyninja24,2,Mon Apr 27 22:44:30 2015 UTC,"Thats how I feed my tiel. I use a high quality pellet (harrisons) for daily feeding, plus lots of green vegetables to nibble on.   I feed her seeds as treats, which she is willing to work for so that way I can teach her tricks and house manners."
cockatiel,3433kw,MirthSpindle,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"Harrisons is the best out there pretty much, but Lafaber and Hagen are close behind. The only reason for Lafaber and Hagen to be so close though is because Harrisons is so expensive. But it is for a reason, and if you were to feed your tiel just that everyday, he'd be a very healthy tiel still. You sound like you have a very smart and disciplined guy! If you are ever up to it, or would like to, you should have him become a therapy animal! All you have to do is get him evaluated, which may be very stressful for a tiel if they aren't good with other people. Just a suggestion if you don't want to hog all of the adorablness to yourself ;P"
cockatiel,3433kw,MirthSpindle,2,Tue Apr 28 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Aww gosh, it would be cool of my tiel could be trained well enough to be a therapy birb. It is definitely possible, but I have a wee more training to do before she gets that far.   Currently I've only trained her to fly to me on command (though sometimes she doesn't want to), fetch, waving hello and spinning around. Nothing too advanced."
cockatiel,3433kw,Colorguarder08,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:59:35 2015 UTC,"The test is mainly how much it can control itself when under stressful situations. I know someone who recently got their African Grey approved with highest test scores possible. The test consisted of people coming in screaming, wearing frightening masks, making as much noise as possible, slamming stuff on the ground all while trying to pet the bird. Any animal can be a therapy pet, just as long as it remains calm and doesn't care about stressful situations. If you don't want your tiel under that much pressure, which makes sense, then you don't have to :P just a suggestion. But good luck and have fun with all of the training!"
cockatiel,3433kw,Colorguarder08,2,Tue Apr 28 04:04:47 2015 UTC,Actually one thing this article is missing is the fact that cockatiels and budies/parakeets actually do better with some seeds. Especially sprouted seeds. Sprouted seeds are one of the best things you can feed your tiels. I feed my tiels a diet consisting of 1.5 tsp seeds 1.5 tsp pellets 1 tablespoon sprouted seeds as well as fresh veggies and fruits and a couple nutriberries or avicakes. I should mention my birds get plenty of out of cage/flight time.
cockatiel,3433kw,Colorguarder08,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:44:55 2015 UTC,"Well of course! The article does mention that it is their nature, what they mainly eat in their natural habitat. It is saying that most of their diet should contain only pellets, and seeds, greens, as treats or the rest. A lot of companies do this well by putting pellets into their seed mixture, but tiels are picky and normally just move them and eat the seeds, which is why it is best to give them seperate."
cockatiel,3433kw,Colorguarder08,2,Thu Apr 30 01:30:47 2015 UTC,well the tl;dr said no seeds and so I just wanted to be sure that people know feeding your tiel seeds is not a bad thing feeding them ONLY seeds is like feeding your child only potatoes. Not healthy on it's own but in a balanced diet with plenty of exercise it's perfectly fine.
cockatiel,3433kw,Colorguarder08,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"Whoops! I did say that. I meant as their only diet, when you put their food bowl out. Thanks for pointing it out! I'll fix it :)"
cockatiel,3419nr,Nezumify,3,Mon Apr 27 14:49:09 2015 UTC,"Any behavior that is rewarded is likely to be repeated. 100% ignore all unwanted behavior. Rewards can be anything from simply coming near the cage or anything verbal to directly giving them what they want (attention, to be covered, etc).  Wait a few minutes or until they are distracted with something else before taking them through any part of the daily routine that they're demanding from you. Reward any and all good behavior, softer sounds, etc with attention, love, and treats. It will take a lot of time and patience, but this bird has a long time left with your family. It will be worth it."
cockatiel,3419nr,Go_Bias,2,Mon Apr 27 16:30:41 2015 UTC,I've tried this before. Maybe I'm not catching her at the right time? She doesn't seem to 'stop'...if she wants out she will literately scream till it happens. Be it five minutes or an hour. She is stubborn.  And what am I supposed to do when she's yelling because the baby is napping? It's not like I can wake the baby up to be part of her 'flock'. She does her damnedest to wake him for us. She has screamed all the way through his 2 hour nap before...only to stop because he woke and rejoined us.
cockatiel,3419nr,MirthSpindle,2,Mon Apr 27 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"I think she gets what she's screaming about a lot of the time because the other two don't. I can't withhold something from them because of Leah and they share the same cage.  Would it be mean to separate them, put Leah in a smaller cage beside the big one so that she can see that they get extra food/treats/outside time because they are 'good' birds? I know they've used peers to teach birds before."

A bird can bleed out if a broken blood feather isn't taken care of.  If you see blood, restrain the bird, find the feather that's bleeding, and pull it out using a hemostat. Tweezers will just slip off. Use a firm, even stroke to pull it; don't yank."
cockatiel,33uty7,AnnOnimiss,3,Sun Apr 26 19:37:10 2015 UTC,I'd swear he's falling apart. Needs lots of rest and quiet time. It's hard work!
cockatiel,33uty7,Colorguarder08,3,Sat Apr 25 22:02:12 2015 UTC,Make sure he has a cuttlefish bone/mineral block thing to chew on to get calcium.  It's also good for wearing down his beak.
cockatiel,33uty7,Monkeyninja24,3,Sat Apr 25 23:44:34 2015 UTC,One of my tiels is in his first molt and is taking forever and by forever I mean he started in NOVEMBER the beginning of November so it's going on 7 months. Misting/bathing them usually provides minor relief. Also when the new pin feathers on their heads are ready (meaning the casing is flaking when you touch it) you can gently help remove the keratin sheath which is what causes them the discomfort.
cockatiel,33uty7,Monkeyninja24,2,Sun Apr 26 03:13:15 2015 UTC,Sorry for the potato quality but here is the wonderful Sancho!  (http://imgur.com/jQGsA7Y.jpg)

cockatiel,33ojrf,mr_lova_lova,8,Fri Apr 24 05:24:13 2015 UTC,"I wish more people knew this. I used to have a mirror in my birds' cage when I was a child and noticed they would be infatuated with it, in an unhealthy way. I removed it and found out later that it shouldn't have been in there to begin with. I wish companies would stop manufacturing and pushing things for pet birds that are actually detrimental to them, like mirror toys, grit, etc."
cockatiel,33ojrf,twolips,2,Fri Apr 24 16:45:20 2015 UTC,Mine only gets brief visits with his girlfriend in the bathroom mirror.
cockatiel,33ojrf,Areeane,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:29:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I have a similar experience. I didn't do it on purpose though. I had moved and unknowingly placed my bird in direct line of sight of a mirror. One day I tried to move his cage and he screamed like crazy. I eventually figured out that he was screaming for the mirror. I felt terrible and tried to wean him off of it but he screamed so much and I live in an apartment building and don't want to get noise complaints. But he still visits me and my bf frequently to hang out so he's not ignoring us or anything. He's a very happy bird. My younger one will never be in the line of sight of a mirror!   How long has it been? Could you wean him off of it without worrying about the noise?
cockatiel,33ojrf,Areeane,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:38:28 2015 UTC,"It has been YEARS -__-"" he also screams when I take it out of the room, but after a while he will be quiet but very moody. Puffed up and depressed :( I don't worry about the noise but how would I go about weaning him off (<-- lol sounds so bad)? You mean slowly taking it away from him?"
cockatiel,33ojrf,bmozzy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:57:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my original plan, to wean him off of it slowly as to not shock him. I also was going to spend more time with him and give him new toys to keep him busy. If you have access to an avian vet maybe you could ask them their opinion on the best approach? I'm sure it's something they see once in a while."
cockatiel,33ojrf,Colorguarder08,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:29:03 2015 UTC,"My cockatiel hated the bird in the mirror for the longest time. He'd always get aggressive and attack the mirror, so we kept him away from mirrors. He was always an aggressive bird in general, though, and after I spent a lot of time working with him, he got to be nicer to people and the bird in the mirror. I put a mirror back in his cage and he wasn't obsessed with it, but would say hi to it every once in a while."
cockatiel,33ojrf,littlestghoust,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:21:02 2015 UTC,I have a mirror in my birds cage but I also have it in the bottom corner of the cage and I have what is called a Velcro bird so he has had no interest in it and really doesn't care for the new bird I brought home on Monday.

cockatiel,33ojrf,Misspissyoants,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:50:47 2015 UTC,Mine was very protective over the bird in the mirror. Took it out and he's much less aggressive now...but it did take a few weeks for the adjustment
cockatiel,33iyv6,sanchoponcho,5,Wed Apr 22 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"'Tiels go through different stages as they grow. My 'tiel will be bitey for a couple weeks, and then needy for a couple weeks, ect. I would suggest that you don't try to push it. Something must have made him stress out. Just provide him with a calm safe environment as much as you can.  Also, since he seems to be having some kind of cage stress, there are a couple ways to fix that. By far the easiest is to remove everything from the cage and give it a thorough cleaning. Put back the food and water bowls, 1 perch, and 1 toy (his favorite).   Make sure you put things in different spots. You want him to feel like this is a new cage. Put one (new or old) item in every day. Do it first thing in the morning when you feed/water him, never at night before bed.  My 'tiel had a big bug get in his sleepy time cage. He slept on our headboard that night since he was too terrified to go anywhere near the cage at all. The next day I removed everything from the cage, made a shelf-like soft perch, and re-introduced him to the cage. It took a couple hours, but he got better."
cockatiel,33iyv6,freckled_porcelain,3,Thu Apr 23 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I will definitely give that a try.   Sancho is very resistant to new things, I could shower him in rewards but he hates water in any form. He doesn't like being misted, bathing in a small pool of water or perching in the shower. After connecting some dots I believe he may be angry about my attempts to teach him to lie on his back as he would have to do it for a vet in the future.  He recently began his first molt which I am sure also plays a big part in his irate mood."
cockatiel,33iyv6,freckled_porcelain,2,Thu Apr 23 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"It's probably just the first molt. 'Tiels are very forgiving, but molting can make them moody. He'll come around in a few days."
cockatiel,33iyv6,diggory_x,2,Thu Apr 23 05:10:29 2015 UTC,If he is molting that is probably it. Mine is have a molt right now and is noticeably more irritable. Showers/Baths help sooth them a little if you one goes for them.

cockatiel,33b3kl,Woozlebuttons,2,Tue Apr 21 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"It...depends.  My 'tiel has been fully-flighted his whole life, and he'll be 9mo old on May 7th.  He still has spills occasionally, but his balance and flying just got to where it's supposed to be.  Heck, he's broken his tail feathers 3 times since I got him(at 9wks old) from poor landings.  He got the nickname ""duckbutt"" for a while. XD  He's still got 1/4th of his tail feathers to come back.  But yeah, fully-flighted or not, they can be super clumsy, especially as babies."

cockatiel,33b3kl,Misspissyoants,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:04:02 2015 UTC,Poor Kevin. I agree with what everyone else is saying. I've had 3 tiels and only one was super clumsy with or without feathers. I had to carry him everywhere and watch him to make sure he didn't fall from too high of a height onto the floor. Some birds are better at gliding than others. Hopefully once he is fully feathered he'll regain his composure. He's probably pretty frustrated too but it'll pass.
cockatiel,33b3kl,penguinpaige,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel better knowing that it's not uncommon for them to be sort of clumsy! And he just molted out one of his clipped feathers, and I see some tail feathers coming in, so improvement seems promising!"

cockatiel,33b3kl,usersalwayslie,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Most tiels are rather clumsy until they are around a year old. They usually start taking better care of their tails around then too. They use their wings and tails for balance so a bad clip and duck butt will definitely affect their balance. fyi, tiels can release their tail feathers when threatened as a defense mechanism. However if they were actually pulled out and the follicles were damaged, they may not grow back. Even if they do start growing back, it can be difficult if only one feather grows in a time. A new tail or flight feather will do better if it has the support of another feather next to it.  In the meantime, try to pad his fall and keep him low if possible. Hopefully Kevin will be doing better in a couple of months."

I can hear him from around half-way across the house, he can get pretty loud, but not too much.  He tends to stay on the quieter side unless something scares him or he's SUPER PO'd about something.  Like me not getting him out when he has excess energy to burn off.  He likes to pull and chew anything that comes near his body, no button/key is safe.  Heck, he broke my 3DS 3D slider from flicking it around. XD"
cockatiel,338j2i,Malted_Shark,2,Thu Apr 23 04:33:49 2015 UTC,Lovely lttle birds but definitely require quite a bit of attention. They can be loud and demand your attention when you're not in the room. Be careful as budgies can be aggressive with them. Quite dusty and yes love to chew.
cockatiel,338j2i,Misspissyoants,2,Tue Apr 21 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"From my experience cockatiels are sweet little birds. Good if you want a bird that wont be too much of a handfull or need too much special treatment. I believe they are categorized as beginner birds, which means they are easy to care for.  They dont seem to be quite as intelligent or active/playful as other birds I have had so I wouldn't get one if you were expecting to have good energetic play times or anything. They love to preen hair and chew loose threads, or the frayed end of a rope toy.  Mostly they are pretty good birds if you treat them right, they dont have any difficult traits like how ringnecks need constant handling or lovebirds are very territorial. My 'tiels did get loud if they didnt have any food or if they were startled by another loud noise. Also if they want to go to sleep but there are things keeping them awake such as a tv or a radio playing in the room. I always covered mine with a sheet at bedtime or they'd get a little antsy. Also if they dont get enough attention or you leave them alone in a room for too long they like to remind you that they are there.  Only male cockatiels can talk, they are very good at remembering whistling tunes, but thier voices arent the clearest.  Cockatiels are the easiest cage/aviary birds to feed. They can live well on mostly seeds and a little supplementary fruit an vegetables. You can feed them budgie seed mix with sunflower seeds added, or you can buy cockatiel mixed seeds.  But as a disclaimer: all birds are different and have different personalities, there will be a lot of things you will find out about your bird after you buy him/her."
cockatiel,338j2i,narufry,2,Tue Apr 21 12:06:59 2015 UTC,"cool, no problem, you should probably do a bit of googling too just in case, I've had 6 cockatiels over time, but mine could have easily just been completely different from others too! Good luck!"
cockatiel,338j2i,narufry,2,Tue Apr 21 16:43:54 2015 UTC,Just saying though that pellets are actually way better for them than seeds! My vet compares seeds to eating fast food every day for them. Pellets can add years to their lives. I personally use Zupreem brand.
cockatiel,338j2i,Areeane,2,Wed Apr 22 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"Whoa! What are the typical traits of people???   My two have incredible personalities, they are also very gentle.  They can become 'cranky' at night after 8:PM  When they become too vocal I ask them if they want to go downstairs, and they fly to my shoulder and that's the end of the excess chirping. I walk them downstairs, they go in their cage, I blow out their seeds and add fresh, change their water, and turn off the light after telling them to find a perch.  Freckles will do her eagle pose and Friendly will climb the walls or the ceiling on the way to his sleeping location.  They puff up and I turn off the light.  Takes about 30 seconds.  Mornings are fun, they're up before me but won't have 'breakfast' until I enter my office and say good morning.  Friendly rides the cage door as it opens, sometimes Freckles joins him.  The climb my arm to my shoulder and I pull the food & water cups so they are facing out of the cage.  They drop onto the food and eat.  Maybe I lucked out and got the two mellowest 'tiels of the 21st century, maybe they are the reincarnation of a happy couple from years gone by.  The only think I hope for it that they will lose their aversion to being scritched, they just don't like to be rubbed, but they treat the attempt more like a game than an assault.  They don't BITE, they play-bite and jump on the hand or arm that's reaching for them.   When they first arrived, they would chew everything! A year later they seem to know what is freely chewable and what isn't.  They can even tell the difference between junk mail and First Class!"

cockatiel,335if9,Kitty_KonKarne,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:06:59 2015 UTC,"My two were 5 months old when I got them.  How old is weaned, and how old is fledged?"
cockatiel,335if9,CTYANKEE44,2,Sun Apr 19 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"Well I kinda meant both. He is weaned from his mother already but is still being hand fed. Once he is eating on his own, in a few weeks, he will be independent.  As for flying, he is already making some attempts at it. His balance isn't great yet, but I think it should be pretty decent by the time I get him. So those two things will pretty much happen at the same time.  As for age, I think he will be around 2 1/2 months."
cockatiel,335if9,CTYANKEE44,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:05:27 2015 UTC,TY for the reply! I've had mine for 13 months now. Amusing little creatures. I'm constantly amazed at the way so much personality can fit into such a tiny brain.

cockatiel,335kvf,ewaldothmar,2,Sun Apr 19 19:36:22 2015 UTC,"Seizure? Do you mean like a panic attack or like an honest-to-goodness seizure: loss of body control, perhaps twitching?   If it was a seizure I would seriously get him to a vet, nobody can help you with that except a proper doctor. You said it was hot; heat stroke can cause seizing. Other than a change in behaviour, is he walking, talking, eating and drinking fine?   If it was just a panic, then he might just be in shock. He may also be going through puberty."
cockatiel,335kvf,Solieus,2,Sun Apr 19 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"It was definitely a seizure. And yeah other than behavior he went back to normal bird stuff after a day. My only apprehension about taking him to a vet is that if I make an appointment but have to cancel it due to another car seizure. I'm not sure if it's worth the risk at that point to continue to try and take him or bring him back home ASAP like I did last time.  And I didn't consider puberty to be a factor, I'll be sure to do some research into that."
cockatiel,335kvf,Solieus,2,Sun Apr 19 20:35:07 2015 UTC,Doesn't your car have air conditioning? Putting a dark towel over his cage and making sure the car is cool... He should be able to make it through a 30min car ride. I'm really not familiar with birds and seizures so I will not recommend anything except see someone who knows better than me. You could try calling a vet; they may be able to give you some advice over the phone.  Here's an article on cockatiels and hormones: http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-behavior-and-training/bird-small-bird-behavior/hormonal-cockatiel.aspx
cockatiel,335kvf,Monkeyninja24,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"If your bird has a siezure, take him to the vet! That being said, with the heat, cockatiels should not go within a 10 degree temperature change within 24 hours. If he is in a 74 degree enviorment, do not move him to a 90 degree area (such as outside if it's hot) without proper precautions taken.   About the attitude changes, he seems to just be going through puberty, and is nothing to worry about. Mood changes are very common in cockatiels. They can go from happy freaks, to they hate everything within the next week! His aggressiveness shows that chances are, he is just maturing.  My suggestions are to take him out more often, if he starts biting you, do not show any reaction to it. He is getting territorial, when you take him out, take him out of sight from his cage. Both of these reminds him that you are superior and dominant. He is trying to establish dominance by acting out on his own. By doing this, you will show him that you are the alpha-bird.   When bringing him to the vet, prepare your car before you go. Make sure the interior is a cool temperature around what he is used to, have some water that he is comfortable drinking from, keep the sun off of his carrier, and keep the car ride as steady as possible. A visit to the vet is probably best right now. They can tell you everything that is wrong, and what treatment he may need."

After panicked searching for an hour, I gave up hope of finding her and began posting for help and calling pet stores/vets to keep an eye out for her.  On the way to grocery shopping about 6 hours later, after it got incredibly windy, we decided to just drive the area real quick, just in case, and we finally heard her and found her in the top of a pine tree. We tried to coax her down, and she dropped down one branch, but we ended up needing to slowly get a ladder and after getting closer to her she finally met me.  So happy I could have cried. I had honestly given up hope. Give your boys and girls scritches, Tybs is getting tons. Here's a couple not-in-a-tree pics that I was afraid would be my last of her."

cockatiel,32z0kg,Areeane,5,Fri Apr 17 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"The night before he had lesions on the corners of his beak and was fluffing up. I then noticed his tongue seemed either swollen or it had a lesion on it too - I also noticed his normally pink tongue had a black spot on it. I knew I would have to take him to the vet first thing in the morning and when I woke him up I saw that his droppings were green - dark green feces and like green urates. I panicked thinking he could have something wrong with his liver and brought him to the nearest vet (non avian), who recommended I go straight to the specialist an hour away.   I don't drive so I had to take a taxi.   They examined him and said it could be mites or a bacterial infection and they would treat for both; gave him something for mites, gave him an injection and gave me antibiotics for him.   They didn't think it was an emergency, most likely, but I know birds and deteriorate FAST so I skipped college and brought him as soon as I could, which cost me a lot. But he is healthy and happy."

cockatiel,32mfen,Ladytsun,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:35:48 2015 UTC,Millet and much much love! Prepare yourself for a few difficult moments though. I just took Pierrot to get his wings clipped (house with many tall windows) and i'm feeling like a bad parent. It's for his own good but it can be a little upsetting to see them so distressed. Hope your little knight feels better soon!
cockatiel,32mfen,cutehulhu,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:06:27 2015 UTC,"I would cover the cage almost completely around. Like with a sheet or towel held with clothespins. But I would open it enough for them to see me and/or chat with them so they knew I was there.  Also, put fresh newspaper down on the cage floor an hour or so before the vet trip. Sometimes the vet can take a fresh stool sample from the paper.   If your tiel responds to commands, tell the vet/vet tech. My vet kept saying ""Step up!"" trying to get my tiel onto his finger. But my tiel was stubborn and only responded to ""UP!"" That saved us some time. :-)  And so much millet. It sucks to see them so stressed out cause you can't explain how temporary it is. But they'll perk back up when you get them home.   Good luck!"
cockatiel,32mfen,penguinpaige,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"I wish my little guy knew commands. He's getting better with 'come here' and a hand point, but if he's feeling poopy he'll just go in the opposite direction. Step up is difficult, when he comes from his cage he'll step up onto my fingers but go immediately to my shoulder, any other time a hand is held out to him below his head he gets aggressive even with the millet distraction.  So unfortunately that means he's going to get manhandled a lot, at least for this vet visit. Oh well, I'll buy his love back with as much millet as his tiny little crop can hold. Thanks for the tips by the way!"
cockatiel,32l0gn,allons_ykaylee,2,Tue Apr 14 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"The best way, ive found, to get birds, (or any other animal for that matter) to trust and like you is through their stomach.   every time you put your hand in their cage, give him a little treat, a small head of millet, a sunflower seed, some crunchy juicy apple.   Hold off on trying to get him to step up until he feels safe enough to eat from your hands without showing any signs of fear or dislike towards you. then you can try moving the food further away to encourae him to step up onto your hand to get at it.   dont move him on your hand just yet, let him get used to standing on your finger without it jumping and bumping him around or taking off when he doesnt expect it.  Make sure you talk to him whenever you're around him, a silent pair of eyes staring into his cage can feel, to him, like a predator silently stalking...  good luck and good job for persevering and asking for help with it instead of giving up on him!"

cockatiel,32juxa,thegreatshandini,2,Tue Apr 14 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"This morning was a scream-fest! I got out of bed and let them out of the cage, before giving them kisses, and becoming a perch for the male (He loves to sit on my head right after being let out of his cage!)"
cockatiel,32gqm8,DobbyIsABird,6,Mon Apr 13 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"It's known as a contact call, it's her way of knowing you're around. So she's obviously grown quite attached to you.  Mine does the same and it drives everyone else in the house crazy, but I never hear it because his whistle changes to a nicer one when he hears or sees me. lol  Nothing you can do other than have them listen to music or something so they are distracted. Add some more toys to the cage. Etc"
cockatiel,32gqm8,vteckickedin,3,Tue Apr 14 01:07:43 2015 UTC,Mine does that too if she is locked in her cage and knows I am home. I have found no real solution other than to have her out all the time when I am home and it is day time. She will settle down at night so I do not have that issue.   When I am out of the house I believe she doesn't cause a fuss because I think she knows there is no point. I put on a radio for her while I am out too which I think helps her calm down.  I know that isn't much of an answer but maybe it'll help a bit.
cockatiel,32gqm8,diggory_x,4,Mon Apr 13 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"My 'tiel is typically in whatever room i'm in. He has recently started screaming when he sees me eating so he can get some. I ignore him and won't feed him any if he does that. If he's good and quiet, he always gets food.  So there are 2 things you can try.   Buy a small play stand like this one that you can have with you at all times. Your bird shouldn't be able to get down on her own, so she can't get in to trouble. If all she wants is to be with you, and see you, this will immediately solve your problem, but would also be inconvenient. This is more difficult. If you hear your bird flipping out, ignore it. Wait until she is calm and quiet for 3 minutes before you walk in the room. Never walk in to the room with your bird unless she is quiet and calm. Don't even let her see you walking towards her when she's screaming. When you are walking to her, make a sound that you wouldn't mind her making to call you. It will take a couple weeks of you doing this consistently, but she'll get it."
cockatiel,32gqm8,freckled_porcelain,3,Tue Apr 14 00:14:39 2015 UTC,Mine screams when I leave but usually gives up after a few minutes of me being gone. I have lived two places now though where my neighbors have had no idea I even had a bird (have asked them). If you find a place with not really thin walls you may be okay. High pitched noise doesn't travel as far. I can hear him in the hallway sometimes but not from the apartment next door.
cockatiel,32gqm8,spam_whale,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:55:50 2015 UTC,"Does she respond to your whistles? My tiel will stop screeching if I do a certain whistle, I think he just wants to know I'm around. Maybe she is the same way?"
cockatiel,32gqm8,BigBadRonni,2,Mon Apr 13 18:30:51 2015 UTC,I used to do that but if she didn't see me immediately she would start to scream at more frequent and higher pitches until she sees me. Its starting to become a huge problem.
cockatiel,32gqm8,BigBadRonni,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sorry :/ I would consult with a local avian vet, because that kind of stress isn't good for you or your birdie. And lots of other people have had this problem so there's got to be a solution somewhere!"
cockatiel,32gqm8,KimmYx33,0,Mon Apr 13 23:04:04 2015 UTC,She is lonely. Buy another tiel. I would recommend to buy a male.
cockatiel,32f1sr,platykurtic_platypus,3,Mon Apr 13 07:04:34 2015 UTC,Sure is!

cockatiel,32dkp2,budgiebum,6,Sun Apr 12 22:21:42 2015 UTC,Haha yup! I'd call his name every few minutes and he would calm down.
cockatiel,32dkp2,zionxgodkiller,5,Sun Apr 12 22:25:13 2015 UTC,"That's sweet :-) my little guy is quiet until I get home, the second he hears me greet my other pets he starts yelling until I come give him love."
cockatiel,32dkp2,Adzismad2,6,Sun Apr 12 22:39:17 2015 UTC,Same with mine! Haha he feels left out sometimes.
cockatiel,32dkp2,penguinpaige,3,Sun Apr 12 22:49:52 2015 UTC,As soon as I walk through the door mine is super excited
cockatiel,32apvx,helphelpbirdhelp,13,Sun Apr 12 03:01:46 2015 UTC,"First, I'm so sorry to hear this happened to you, that's so scary :( I hope you're doing all right.  He must be very scared. I would just sit with him near his cage, quietly whistling or talking to him to make him feel safer. I wouldn't do anything else with him (as someone else said, I wouldn't give him a shower even if he normally likes it). He's trying to deal with a scary experience and being in a brand new environment so suddenly. He'll calm down eventually and hopefully he can get some rest soon. Getting him to an emergency vet is a good idea, I hope it won't be too hard for you to get there with him.  Tap water will be just fine!  You're a great bird owner for being so concerned for him. Keep us updated!"
cockatiel,32apvx,Areeane,3,Sun Apr 12 04:13:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'll update tomorrow after hopefully seeing a vet. No real changes so far, still not going in his cage."
cockatiel,32apvx,Areeane,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"Letting him be where he wants to be is a good idea for now, poor little guy."
cockatiel,32apvx,raviax,5,Sun Apr 12 06:08:33 2015 UTC,"Try to keep a light on somewhere as a night light to avoid night fright (sorry for the unintentional rhymes). we used an old fish tank with a heating pad under it with some blankets and perches when ours were in shock. we were successful in 1 of the 3 times we had to deal with it. I'm hoping your feathered baby will be ok. just keep talking to him calmly, singing and whistling. what kind of bird?"
cockatiel,32apvx,seajellie,3,Sun Apr 12 05:29:12 2015 UTC,This is a great idea. Is he prone to night fights (as more tiels are)? Think about padding his cage with towels in case he falls off the perch. Keep up the soothing background noise but my best advice is to keep calm and still be a part of his flock. Show him you are still eating and you are still calm and that everything will be okay. Share food with him (even if you just pretend). sucks to have to be the tough one after your trauma :-( this is my experience as a vet tech for birds. Sorry you guys are having a rough time.  Updates? ?
cockatiel,32apvx,justme_3774,3,Sun Apr 12 06:31:46 2015 UTC,"These are all wonderful ideas. Thank you both. He is a tiel and already prone to frights, so he always sleeps with a nightlight. That's another thing I left at home, but we're just laying with the regular light on now anyway. Thanks for your support."
cockatiel,32apvx,justme_3774,2,Sun Apr 12 07:37:46 2015 UTC,Oh poor baby :( How is he today?   Also how are you? Anything stolen or anyone hurt? What happened?
cockatiel,32apvx,IndominusRex,2,Wed Apr 15 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"We're both healing. His latest bit of progress over the last day or so is that he's starting to show interest in toys slightly. He looked very intently at a piece of ribbon today that I offered him, and earlier he took a piece of crinkle shredded paper from me.  Thank you for your concern."
cockatiel,32apvx,cutehulhu,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:03:07 2015 UTC,Aw. I hope you both continue to improve. <3
cockatiel,32apvx,amandar00lz,2,Fri Apr 17 10:45:07 2015 UTC,"Normally I would talk to him in a calming, quiet voice when he gets startled. Is his hearing likely as fucked up as mine is? My ears are ringing so loud I can barely hear a thing. I wonder if he can even hear me talking and trying to comfort him.  Sorry for so many questions."
cockatiel,32apvx,jessicamooney,2,Sun Apr 12 03:17:03 2015 UTC,"Their hearing is more sensitive than ours is, so I imagine he's feeling it. This may be a situation in which time will be the best healing factor. Stay with him and talk to him. Birds respond well to a known and trusted voice. Keep everything as quiet and low key as you can for him. He needs to de-stress.  Hope everything is alright and I'm sorry this happened to you."
cockatiel,32apvx,KHanau,2,Sun Apr 12 03:41:05 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. I'm playing some piano music that I sometimes use if he has a hard time sleeping. I'm not sure if it's helping or if he hears it though.

cockatiel,323lzs,brownmanthings,3,Fri Apr 10 08:30:25 2015 UTC,"I am not 100% sure as mine has never done it, but finding hiding spots in females is definitely a sign of nesting.   If she does end up laying, I gather you are general supposed to leave them alone because they will be very territorial over the egg and removing it before they reject it will make them want to lay another. Eventually they will abandon it and then you can remove it.  If she does lay, you need to add extra calcium to her diet for a little while as egg laying drains that mineral from them. If you know she will grind a calcium block then you can use that, but if not look at food/water supplements.   Once you have that sorted, you need to look into adjusting her routine so she doesn't do it again because too much egg laying can drain their calcium to dangerous (life threatening) levels. Making sure she gets plenty of night time, undisturbed sleep is the best thing you can do. Aim for ~10 hours a day. That helped my tiel stop getting all ""matey"" for no reason.  Note: I am not a vet, nor have had my tiel lay so I by no means an expert, this is just stuff I have read for my own information as my tiel is a lady too.  Hope this helps."

I searched for ""cockatiel enlarged nostril"" and found one person whose bird had a bacterial infection and another with a response from a vet talking about a respiratory / sinus infection."

cockatiel,31xilm,bbbbirdistheword,15,Wed Apr 8 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"Now...now I'm sad....Like....shit.   But I will try to acquiesce.   So my fiance and I were having two friends over for dinner. We had dinner and were playing a few after-dinner board games. Dessert that night was vanilla cake with chocolate frosting. So during our riveting game of Cards vs Humanity, we broke out the cake: 4 pieces on separate plates. Nico (short for Copernicus), our then recent addition, was very curious and would run down our arms to explore the table of neat human things. We let him go and resumed. After another hand, our friend looks down and see the little bastard standing on top of his cake -  feet buried in the frosting. At this point we all noticed and began laughing. While we were incapacitated laughing, his head and eyes focused on nearby cake. He hopped of and jumped on another piece, leaving chocolate footprints across the table. When he got up, he had such a prideful little punk-ass face. Here he is. Our much more reserved 'tiel, as you can see, is sitting on my shoulder watching from afar.  Oh and here are a few more bonus pictures of when he was a baby 1 2"
cockatiel,31xilm,abIngenui,3,Wed Apr 8 23:56:56 2015 UTC,"Aww, such a cutie. I was not expecting a picture of Nico IN the icing. Thank you!"

cockatiel,31xilm,Areeane,10,Thu Apr 9 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"This is him as a young 'un.  He's lived through two generations of birds and had one great love and for the past few years an on-again/off-again girlfriend.  This is him now.  For those who haven't lost a bird, note the vomit on his cheeks, squinted eyes, puffed/messy feathers, and poor grip. Other things you can't see: lack of energy, sleeping with both feet down, low heart rate.   One thing you should definitely know about your bird is their standard heart rate. It's a good idea to check regularly."
cockatiel,31xilm,lotuslane,5,Wed Apr 8 22:54:32 2015 UTC,Keep some feathers so you can remember how soft he is. I am sorry that you are losing your friend. I'm tearing up thinking about how old mine is. :(

cockatiel,31xilm,Areeane,5,Thu Apr 9 04:46:07 2015 UTC,Did this come on suddenly? Have you taken him to an avian vet? This is very sad. I hope it isn't what you may think is happening and that you have a chance to save him. Best wishes in any event.
cockatiel,31xilm,Areeane,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it came on while I was at work. I came home and I was certain he was on the verge of dying. Every sign I knew to look for was there except staying at the bottom of the cage. I recognized the vomiting from his girlfriend, who had some cheek feathers stained with vomit here and there for the past few weeks. I watched her quite a lot, because I assumed SHE was getting sick (although it turned out to be him). It was very scary to only realize weeks later that I identifed the wrong bird, but unfortunately there was no obvious indication that he was sick until yesterday evening."
cockatiel,31xilm,1nsane95,3,Fri Apr 10 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Petey came to me after a friend's grandmother passed away.  She had been ill for a long time and Petey had been neglected and became cage bound. It took us about 6months for Petey to trust to step up and sit on a regular basis.  We had a scare last May. He had a lump on his toe. I've had other cockatiels before, so I knew this could turn into an ordeal.  Our vet was fantastic, removed the benign cyst. And when the vet returned informed me that Petey is just the sweetest bird. Never bit once. That's my sweetheart! Vet-certified Sweetest Bird In The World!  Watching him wake up from the drugs was so cute. He sat on my thumbs while I cradled him, his head slowly drifting backwards beak slightly open like a toddler in a carseat.  I can't imagine not ever having my quirky cage-loving bird. I hope your little buddy doesn't suffer long, and your heart heals soon.  Here is Peter the Lady Bird http://imgur.com/6YZ7SHm"

A few weeks later, 4 more budgies died of unexplained causes. 6 months later my two zebra finches were eaten by what I suspect to be a rodent, and about 11 months ago my favorite cockatiel escaped her cage and never returned. I am not trying to one up you on this, but all I want to say is that losing a pet that you've had for a long time is really difficult. Stay strong, fellow bird lover!"

In fact, I doubt there's a pet my family hasn't had (besides the super rare ones, like toucans or bobcats or something).  I'm used to family member's (i.e. pets) dying, it's just much harder for the pet that I consider the first pet I was fully in charge of coming to the end of his life."
cockatiel,31xilm,HiddenSwan,3,Thu Apr 9 02:25:48 2015 UTC,"Best of wishes for your tiel.  My 6 month tiel Sancho is a huge flirt. He has always been curious about my chihuahuas, both of which are deathly afraid of him. One day he is perched on my finger and I comfort my dog while slowly introducing him to Sancho. Sancho began to strut around on my arm then proceeded to jumping onto my dog, which completely horrified the dog. Frightened, my dog ran off with Sancho at the reigns and my tiel rode him around for a good minute before parting ways with the dog.   My other chihuahua is much smaller, and submissive. She likes to sleep in my lap, unfortunately for her Sancho has apparently laid claim to me. He tried to pinch her ear, and eat her claws before I moved her. Once I moved her off of me he hopped off and walked over to her as she sat on the couch. Expecting another bite I picked Sancho up. Sancho instead began strutting again, except this time he  was an inch from the dog and he bowed at her, likely expecting a scratch or two. After a moment he picked his head up and then bowed again, this time he began serenading her. To this day he will serenade her every chance he gets."

cockatiel,31t7sk,Luynva,6,Tue Apr 7 23:49:30 2015 UTC,"It's that time of year, and your cockatiel is of age to start breeding. What you're experiencing is the rage of hormones associated with cockatiel puberty. The mirror is making the problem worse because it's leading him to believe that there is another cockatiel in the cage with him. Removing the mirror will help with the territorial issues, but it won't fix the hormones.   To help with the hormones, there are a few things you can try:   Remove anything that the cockatiel could consider a nest. This includes boxes and huts.  Rearrange the cage contents to keep your cockatiel on its toes. If it feels slightly unfamiliar with its surroundings, it may rethink its nesting ideas. LOTS OF SLEEPY TIME. Give your cockatiel at least 12 hours of dark time. This makes the cockatiel think that it's not spring/summer, and may reduce hormones.   If you introduce another cockatiel to the equation, this isn't going to go away. In fact, it's likely to make the problem work. If you get a female, you may have baby cockatiels and two territorial birds to contend with. Getting another male cockatiel will just force you to cope with two territorial, hormonal male cockatiels.   Remember that this is normal, natural behavior, so it's something that you're going to have to adjust to.   Here are a few more resources on dealing with hormones:  http://www.tailfeathersnetwork.com/birdinformation/hormones.php  http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-behavior-and-training/bird-small-bird-behavior/hormonal-cockatiel.aspx  Best of luck!"

Mine wasn't getting violent, she was getting frisky (for some reason, cups of tea was her thing!). After a week or two of making sure she got 10+ hrs of night time sleep a day she no longer acts.... odd."

cockatiel,31kbfd,KawltieK,4,Sun Apr 5 22:31:08 2015 UTC,"generally speaking, that coloring is what baby cockatiels (male & female) and adult females look like. but given the darker beak (a sign of aging) this is most likely an older lady cockatiel. how long have you had her? if she has a band on her leg, it might have a number you can look up, or the year of her hatch."
cockatiel,31kbfd,amandar00lz,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info. I've had her for ~3 years.

Such a sweet girl!"
cockatiel,31kbfd,amandar00lz,2,Wed Apr 8 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, I'd say she wasn't more than a year or two when you got her so just add that to the time you've had her and that's a good estimation of age. I doubt a pet store would keep the same cockatiel for 2+ years although I've never worked in one so it's hard to say."

He likes the gluten-free pasta I use for spaghetti and oyster crackers, too. Your girl might like some of those, though I'm not sure how nutritional any of them are. Out of those the eggs might be your best bet.  Does she eat pellets? I've heard good things about both Harrison's and Roudybush, nutrition-wise.  Pellet berries or Nutriberries might be worth looking into, too."
cockatiel,31im28,birdoge,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:29:01 2015 UTC,Just like us birds need calories & protein to bulk up.  Treats are high in both.  Spray Millet will pack the 'pounds' (g) on but need a balanced diet to ensure complete nutrition.    You could just do what old fashioned folks did.  Mix some hot suet (fat) with some seeds and press them into tiny cakes...  Never met a critter that would turn down tasty greasy treats!

cockatiel,31ayx6,olofthebird22,6,Fri Apr 3 12:54:12 2015 UTC,SO ACCURATE. My cockatiel died in August. We were cleaning some older paperwork off our desk and found lots of little cockatiel sized holes all along the edge. I miss that little goof.

My little guy is almost 2, last summer I lived with a buddy to save up for a big move - he had a tiel too (boy, about 7 or 8). We're both the ""your cage is your bed"" type of 'tiel owners - they get free reign of the room unless it's bedtime. So Day 1 I left my little guy inside his cage in the bird room, Day 2 I let him come out and play. They had one little fight (nothing serious, it was actually pretty funny) and then became best buds for the remainder of the summer.  The best part of it all though is it mellowed both of our 'tiels out a lot. Neither of them would scream for us anymore when we weren't around and were less moody."

Also they tend to get stepped on pretty easily so I wouldn't encourage any low walking.   Oohhh, thatd be a good idea.

cockatiel,314ioq,footypjs,2,Thu Apr 2 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like mine! She was a ""rescue"" in that I got her from a previous owner where she was neglected at best.   When I walk around the house with her, she's either on my head, shoulder, or on my hand, around shoulder height. She's most comfortable with new situations perched atop my head. When we're on the couch together, I often put her on the back of the couch. Again, it's highest so she feels more safe. It also allows her to run the length of the couch and inspect whomever else is sitting. If not there, I put her on my leg. She likes to be close and she's fairly relaxed sitting on me.   I've had her for ~4 years and while she'll hang out around the house with me, she doesn't let me pet her, so it might take a while and a lot of patience!"

If he has a favorite treat, like millet, if you can bring that with you when you sit on the couch it may encourage him to stay longer.  We used a small plate with seeds and millet on it to encourage our bird to stay and 'visit' us on the couch.  From there he started letting us scritch him and he started exploring.  He still loves sitting on his cage though, it's his base of operations."

I live in the UK and I used a site which I guess is similar to craigslist (called Preloved).   If you cannot find someone you know and trust who would like to take them then you do not have much of a choice but to advertise somewhere. The only thing you can bare in mind though is you are perfectly entitled to refuse someone who shows interest if you don't think they are suitible. You can invite someone to come and see the birds and gauge if you think they would be a good match.  When I was rehoming my degus I had someone come who didn't really seem that interested. Fortunately for me he never came back to me so I didn't have to tell him to piss off. However the next people who came to get them was mother and her kids and I could tell they were interested and suitable because they had already taken the time to research the care for the species and had questions for me.   You will have to accept that you cannot know for sure if it'll work out but you can tell if someone will try to care or not."

It looks almost exactly like that. :-) It's quite pokey and annoying so that's likely why he's trying to be so careful.
cockatiel,30r32b,LemonMagician,2,Mon Mar 30 05:25:14 2015 UTC,I don't think it's anything worrisome.  I think it just looks weird because for some reason there's very few surrounding feathers.  Giving him a warm bath might help encourage him to get everything straight.

cockatiel,30r32b,Razlyk,3,Mon Mar 30 00:13:14 2015 UTC,"if it were my bird, I would give it a day or two. All the coloration of the flesh and feather seem normal. Is he acting weird or like it's painful?"
cockatiel,30r32b,justme_3774,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"He won't really stretch that wing or let me near it, but other than that he seems normal. He's not shaking and he is still singing."
cockatiel,30r32b,Chubnubblestiltskin,2,Mon Mar 30 00:17:29 2015 UTC,I just don't know. Looking at the other two pics you posted makes me nervous to. I'm really hoping someone can come along and say it's nothing.
cockatiel,30r32b,Chubnubblestiltskin,2,Mon Mar 30 00:19:21 2015 UTC,I just took a closer look at his wing and realized that it's not skin (even though that's what it looks like in the close up pics). It looks more like blood on the inside of the feather. I think you're right and it is just a pin feather/blood feather.
cockatiel,30mh8z,srccd,3,Sat Mar 28 18:59:35 2015 UTC,What a beautiful bird! :)

We met the little critter weeks ago and were smitten. Haven't found out the gender yet. Our new family member seems happy - especially hiding in her/his mom's hair.  Aside: I heard all about cockatiel's being dusty, but wow. My shirt is covered with little feathers and white specks right now."

cockatiel,30ni6f,Gowlloe,2,Sun Mar 29 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"as per cockatielcottage the best size is the largest you can afford and fit.  this is our downstairs cage.  The cage itself is approx. 21 cubic feet.  We have 4 tiels, when we are home they are able to fly around and play on top of cage.  When we are not, they stay in this cage and have plenty of room (more toys and perches have been added since this pic was taken).  We have a smaller cage in the bedroom for when we go to bed and they will go and sleep in that cage.  That cage upstairs is not suited for 4 birds, but they love to sleep in it so we let them."
cockatiel,30ni6f,PackerFanNYC,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'm actually planning to size up, I think the more space they have, the happier they are because they can stretch out there wings and have more toys to play with"
cockatiel,30ni6f,asstoupee,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:01:43 2015 UTC,"We are not experts since we just brought our Rousey home a few days ago. However, we did a lot of research while we waited to get our new baby (hatched in January). We saw the same info about 24x18, but after reading plenty of forum posts, we decided that 18x18 will be plenty to start with. We got the 18x18 Prevue off Amazon. Inside dimensions are about 17.5x17.5x30. There is plenty of room for toys and the bird. I could see more length being nice in the long term, but not a requirement. We also took into account that we plan to leave our little one out more times than not, so the play area on top is nice.  We are very happy with the quality compared to some of the ones you find in the brick and mortar stores nearby.  As for the bar gap, the 3/4 of this cage is not a problem."
cockatiel,30ni6f,srccd,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"24x18x24 is good, but you should get bigger if you can afford it and the bird is in it most of the time. No creature likes being in a small space for extended periods. Check craigslist, or flea markets for good deals. I got my cockatiel's cage nearly brand new at a local flea market for only $25, and it's huge. Width is more important than height, as the bird will generally stay on the top perches anyway. My cockatiel's cage is about 36 inches wide by 20 inches deep and about 4 feet high, but he only uses the top foot and a half or so. You can also look at cages on amazon or ebay, as they have some good deals. Most places recommend 1/2 - 5/8 bar spacing for cockatiels, so 5/8 is fine. :-)"

I try to take her out as often as I can but she doesn't seem to like to come out in the evenings so that just leaves like an hour in the mornings before work.

I think it's just him trying it out ahead of time though, because he immediately makes a more confident sound that's a really similar pitch."

cockatiel,30ncfa,justme_3774,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:55:46 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry. He could be learning to whistle or imitating something you haven't noticed. Mine used to make a weird clicking sound but I finally realized he was imitating the sound of my straightener turning on.

He has one (that he knows he isn't allowed to do) that is literally an imitation of some guys car alarm. He also makes the same ""squeak"" my bedroom door does as like a ""hello"" call, because that's the sound he hears every time somebody comes into the room.

Since you are posting to reddit, rather than asking Google, I assume you want anecdotal answers, so here goes:  My birds lose feathers all the time. Tail feathers and wing feathers take them anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to grow back. Depends on the nutrition, emotional state, and health of your bird."

cockatiel,3075lf,theySEEmeTROLL1N,2,Wed Mar 25 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"for me, 6 to 9 months for a whole set of feathers to come back after being all clipped off at the same time."
cockatiel,3075lf,MirthSpindle,2,Wed Mar 25 04:47:37 2015 UTC,"Former groomer here:  [Which feathers are clipped?](www.takoda-aviary.com/wing_clip.jpg)  Generally parrots are supposed to learn to fly before their first clip. And the first clip should be light.  It should prevent them from gaining height, not make them drop to the ground.  Only the first 5 primary flight feathers should be cut, at most.  Generally on a younger tiel, I would only do 3 at first.  Anyway, the feathers will come back in the next molt.  Could be anywhere from a week to 6 months for the process to start.  At that age, I would expect the primary flights to be regrown in the next two-three months"

cockatiel,2zufsf,Drugonaut,3,Sun Mar 22 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"Boy birds sometimes like to find nest sites too. Our male used to scout sites and try to convince our female to nest in them. The attacking makes me think your bird is nesting - whether he has a mate or not. There's no harm in allowing it in males, as far as i know, but it can lead to chronic egg laying in females. That's definitely bad for them, and should be discouraged."
cockatiel,2zufsf,Ancalimei,2,Sun Mar 22 01:41:13 2015 UTC,It can cause aggressiveness in boy birds; they want to protect their nest or something.  We had to close the drawer our bird liked to hide in and not let him in anymore since he was attacking me and drawing blood.

That being said, our avian vet mentioned that birds can get by with a much lower blood count than mammals. Maybe there's hope if you keep him warm, well fed, and hydrated. Feed him whatever he wants until he's feeling better. It's also important to keep him very warm, at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Hope he gets well soon! :("

cockatiel,2zn70s,Mortress,3,Thu Mar 19 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"I have a cockatiel and a lovebird (both male) who live in the same cage. They're not best friends, but they respect each other and I often catch them doing things together. And they don't like to be away from each other. Personally(possibly selfishly:P), I would rather have different species together. I've had bonded pairs of lovebirds and I often felt ""left out"" of the flock.  Now I have two cuddle bugs and I never feel guilty leaving anybody all by themselves."

Our bird is over 20 years old he has gotten sick a couple of times. Peace and quiet soft talk maybe some classic music seems to help calm them.

cockatiel,2zi3gm,aishadorable,3,Wed Mar 18 19:36:17 2015 UTC,My female did this a couple times when she was younger. She actually made a squirrel friend by chattering with it.

cockatiel,2zi3gm,VocePoetica,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:04:43 2015 UTC,Well if it helps any he picked up the bird calls outside within three weeks of moving in with us (he is only 11-12 weeks old) and the wolf whistle within a week of my boyfriend doing it.
cockatiel,2zi3gm,dunndeal,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"They can, they just don't have the hormonal response that makes them do it to the extent males do. They don't tend to whistle as much either. Mine definitely did and still does to some extent as she matches her tweets to her new bunk mate or other birds she hangs out with."
cockatiel,2za4ek,WTFisTHis098,8,Mon Mar 16 21:55:37 2015 UTC,How long was the photo taken after the string was removed?  That leg looks very swollen; if it hasn't gone down I'd get to a vet as soon as possible.  You can use this tool to find an avian vet in your area; I'd at least call and get their advice.
cockatiel,2za4ek,vaqari,3,Mon Mar 16 22:29:05 2015 UTC,"Please take it to the vet. You can't know how long the blood supply was compromised in the leg, and there is possibility for infection. Might not be a serious injury, but if it is it has the potential to effect proper development of the leg. Baby chicks are hard enough to care for! Hope all turns out well for you and your little friend.   Source: vet student"
cockatiel,2za4ek,maddieface,2,Tue Mar 17 11:22:48 2015 UTC,"Seconded. A vet is required.  Also please, please, please research before breeding. Keeping anything in a nest box that has strings is extremely dangerous for this reason. Breeding should not be taken lightly. Baby birds are extremely fragile and can and will die very quickly if things aren't done right. It isn't fair to the birds if you aren't willing to do the research required to avoid preventable injuries such as this one."
cockatiel,2za4ek,DrsansPhD,2,Tue Mar 17 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"I had something similar happen to my cat (I know, parront owning cats, weird) and the swelling went down within a couple hours. If it doesn't within a couple hours, that's a real injury: seek a vet."
cockatiel,2z8jws,Passan,3,Mon Mar 16 14:58:07 2015 UTC,Old girlfriend and I lived next to a house with a dog in the yard 24-7. We both worked the same shift so he was home alone with a barking dog to keep him company most of the day. He does this pretty much on demand now.   Don't have a video camera so I wanted to at least get some audio of it. Recorded it about a year ago. Just found this sub and figured you guys might find it funny.
cockatiel,2z7ty7,Totuto,3,Mon Mar 16 09:46:40 2015 UTC,"Is her head up or down? Tail and bum up or down? Could be a mating behavior, but hard to say. A pic or two could be helpful"
cockatiel,2z7ty7,Ladytsun,1 point,Mon Mar 16 10:06:51 2015 UTC,"Her head is a little down while whistling, so is the rest of the body. I was trying to make a video but when I moved to take the phone, she stopped doing that, and she only did that like 2, max 3 times since I got her."
cockatiel,2z7ty7,diggory_x,4,Mon Mar 16 10:13:17 2015 UTC,"Does she appear to shudder slightly? If so it definitely sounds like mating behavior. Unless you are breeding ofc, you want to discourage that because she can make herself ill if she starts laying eggs, even unfertilized ones.   My female used to do this and you can get them to eventually stop doing it by (a) ignoring her when she does this behavior and (b) making her sleep at night longer (~10 hours)."

cockatiel,2z7vdd,Totuto,2,Mon Mar 16 10:10:45 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue from gathering from an outdoor source is the potential that there are chemicals contaminating the plants. If you used a store bought potting soil with weed protection or growth additives, have weed killer sprayed over the lawn, or any other treatment along those lines it can be incredibly dangerous for your bird to consume."

cockatiel,2z7vdd,squeekypig,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:09:30 2015 UTC,"I think one issue with gathering grass from outside is that the grass species might be dangerous. Not all grass is the same species, and lawns are usually made up of a mix of grasses (some mixes are formulated for sun, some for shade, some with more clover, etc). With just a quick Google search, it looks like Johnsongrass is toxic to birds, and that's a pretty common weed grass where I live. It looks like cat grass (which might be similar to what you purchased?) can be made up of wheat, oat, barley, flax, rye."

cockatiel,2z60fw,wwjdforaklondikebar,3,Sun Mar 15 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"That cage is too small for her to stay in forever, but for the time being it will suffice until you switch her back to the old one. I would leave in one or two perches, and keep the cage high on a counter. If she is still freaking out, place a blanket over it to calm her."

cockatiel,2z60fw,Misspissyoants,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by flipping in her cage?  The cage isn't a bad size (I actually have the same one that I keep the budgies in) but it isn't a great shape (which I unfortunately didn't know until after buying it either). It should be fine for a temporary home for one 'tiel, though.  Is she doing something like this: http://www.cockatielcottage.net/Images_Photos/CCBirds2/small2/jake4_quechart.jpg ? If so, it's a territorial thing that's probably being triggered by the change in cage."
cockatiel,2z60fw,DrsansPhD,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:45:34 2015 UTC,"No, she will do flips...like, somersaults in the cage  I thought it was cute the first time i saw her do it...and then i realized she wasnt doing a trick."
cockatiel,2z60fw,Colorguarder08,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:18:05 2015 UTC,I don't why she is flipping but I can tell you a few things wrong with the cage. A) It's small for a cockatiel B) It's crowded with dowel perches C) There's only one toy D) It's on the floor. Since I am hoping this is just a temporary cage if I was you I would first put the cage on a table or dresser or something to get it off the floor. Take out the dowels and purchase natural perches (but only one or two for how small that cage is) as they are a lot better for your birds feet as they apply pressure to different points as the bird moves around and therefore reducing the likelihood of your bird getting bumble foot. I would also add 2-3 more toys to stimulate your bird.

cockatiel,2z4lhs,wwjdforaklondikebar,4,Sun Mar 15 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"Do NOT give up hope on your lost tiel! You need to use Parrot Alert (https://www.parrotalert.com/) ASAP to get the word out that there is a lost tiel.  Put up lost posters. Go to your neighbors and tell them to keep an eye open for him. You should also contact your local humane society, pet stores, and all vet offices. If someone finds him, they may bring him to one of these places.   If I were you I would buy a temporary cage to house your remaining tiel, and leave the cage he knows outside with the door open with food in it.   No matter what happens, you will have to wait at least 30 days before introducing a new tiel to Cricket. This is to prevent the spread of disease."
cockatiel,2z4lhs,myaussiefriends,2,Sun Mar 15 16:01:33 2015 UTC,Im putting up more posters today and i wasnt going to even look for another bird for at least a month.  Ive done every social media thing (and parrotalert) and ive called all the vets - and ill call them again tomorrow.   I left the cage out and ill buy another cage for Cricket when im done putting up posters.  I just dont know what else to do! Poor Cricket looks lost
cockatiel,2z4lhs,myaussiefriends,2,Sun Mar 15 16:26:40 2015 UTC,"You're doing everything right. I'm not sure what the circumstances of losing Cotton were, but you should make sure to fix whatever it was that caused him to escape.   Playing some youtube videos of cockatiels singing might perk up Cricket. She is going to be upset though no matter what - just like a person, birds will grieve when someone they love leaves. Maybe offer her some extra millet or a bit of her favorite foods to comfort her a bit."
cockatiel,2z4lhs,myaussiefriends,2,Sun Mar 15 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"I was leaving my house and if my roommate is home, I'll leave the birds out bc they like to sit around him sometimes, but Cotton didn't want me to leave so he came around the corner towards me.  Since my hands were full, I couldn't grab him and he got scared and flew over my head outside.  Well, I live in an apartment and he was already high up so he got scared and flew higher.  There are a LOT of apartments on my street so he was flying around to find me and I guess he was too high up or something.  He could hear me he just couldn't figure out where I was.  He flew around my neighborhood about 5 times trying to find me while I was whistling to him but he doesn't fly in the best circles so he went in the wrong direction to a place I couldn't get to by foot (there was a fence and a coulee in the way).  So i ran to the streets that could get me closest to him and I lost him.    TL;DR: I'm a bad bird mama"
cockatiel,2z4lhs,sledded,3,Sun Mar 15 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to come off as patronizing, but in the future, make sure that they are in their cages every time you know the door/window will be open. Birds are just so quick sometimes. I definitely wouldn't call you a bad owner.   Keep your hopes up! There are plenty of stories of birds getting out, and being found weeks later."

cockatiel,2z1xj0,cacille,3,Sun Mar 15 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"I lost a bird and have a similar story, but the ending isn't quite so happy. I was in the living room with my bird on my shoulder, and when a family member opened the front door, my bird got spooked and flew out the open door. It soared for about 60 feet, then turned around in mid-air and went sailing over my apartment as I called to her.  I searched for hours and hours that night throughout the neighborhood with no luck.  The next morning I was out looking again, calling her name. I heard her in a tree down the street, with a brick wall separating us. I then saw the bird fly out of the tree, in my general direction but my view was blocked by some trees and houses. That was the last time I saw my bird.  I put posters up everywhere, called the local bird shop, etc.   About 4 days later I got an odd call from a clearly very young boy. He said that a bird had flown into the window of his house one day, and wanted to know how much the reward was for returning her. He also described the bird and it seemed to match my bird.  I explained that the reward was $500 (all I had at the time in the bank) and that was enough money that he could buy a bird of his own if he wanted). I asked where he lived and let him know I could come by and pick up the bird, but he hemmed and hawed and eventually hung up.  I couldn't reach him again after that.  I was bummed out but looking back its good to know another family got her and she wasn't lost in the outdoors or worse. :)"
cockatiel,2z1xj0,mbcarl,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you were able to get your cockatiel back! I love how your neighbors tried to help you. I have a story from the other side. When I was a kid, there was a parakeet flying loose in my neighborhood. No one on my street owned any birds at the time. The bird was in our backyard for a while one day, so someone brought over a birdcage, thinking that if we put seed in there he might go in and we could catch him. He didn't go in the cage, but he hung around for a while. On the next day, he was across the street flying around. He flew under a parked car at one point, and I was able to reach under the car and catch him in my hands! It started biting me, and I realized I didn't have a plan for what to do if I caught him in my bare hands, so I let him go. Fortunately, a neighbor was home, and was smart enough to throw a sheet over the bird when it flew onto a porch roof. We never found the previous owner, so the bird became the neighbor's pet. It seems like that parakeet was a resilient little guy too, since he stayed in our neighborhood for a few days. We even have hawks and falcons in our neighborhood, and a bright green parakeet would be an easy prey to spot. So I agree, don't lose all hope if your bird gets loose!"
cockatiel,2z0lxr,wwjdforaklondikebar,3,Sat Mar 14 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"So sorry to hear, but please dont give up hope. I lost mine twice (yes two times he flew away) and once we didnt find him until after 2 days. Keep distributing flyers, and check with the local animal shelters, chances are if someone has found her they'll bring her there."
cockatiel,2z0lxr,viva1992,3,Sat Mar 14 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"I'm really worried that he got exhausted and fell (Cotton isnt the best flyer) or that he will starve.  I posted a hundred signs wothing a half mile radius...i just dont know if someone  catches him, if theyll give him back.

Its also an area FULL of apartment complexes.  Someone called me earlier saying they saw him and i think it was just a prank  I just dont know what to do....i can only whistle for him so much! i feel guilty eating bc he might be starving.

cockatiel,2z0lxr,viva1992,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:54:47 2015 UTC,Not really much more i can suggest. Print out more flyers. Increase the reward. Make sure everyone knows. Keep at it & best of luck!

The cons: they're a royal pain to empty and refill, the perch inside is a soft wood that is quickly destroyed, and they take up a lot of room inside the cage if you don't have a compatible door.  My cockatiels aren't messy enough with their food to keep using them, but I do use them with my (incredibly messy) parakeets."
cockatiel,2yuvvs,vaqari,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:43:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the breakdown of pros and cons! I've seen some online that look like they come with a plastic perch.  In the pic I posted, the perch looks plastic. http://imgur.com/MIlpxCy    I think I'll just ask the seller beforehand if they have the version where the perch is plastic.   I can see why they'd be a pain in the rear to empty and refill. One pro for me though is my birds eat pellets, so all they do is pulverize the pellets into it's literally of a flour consistency.. and they will eat that too, but it gets all over everything if I don't vacuum every half hour.  I think the pros far outweigh the cons for me in this case. One more question, did you feel that the plastic seemed durable, and not like that crappy stuff that breaks super easily? I guess I mean, when you hold it in your hands, does it feel like a quality product?  I measured, and the openings on my cage are 3.5 inches wide, and 4 inches high. Does that sound like it would be okay? I read the description for the small one, and it's  5.6 by 5.3 by 4.2 inches. I suppose the extra width and height will just hang off the side of the cage opening on either end.  Also, my cage openings look exactly like that picture of the tidy bird feeder I posted.  Oh, one last question (sorry to have replied with like 10 billion questions)... is the small size big enough to be comfortable for a cockatiel? I'd assume so, as it's like 5.6 inches wide by 4 inches deep.  Do you use that size for your budgies, or is there an even smaller size?   That's funny your parakeets make a huge mess! For me it's the exact opposite. My cockatiels are the huge messy ones and my parakeets are tidy."
cockatiel,2yuvvs,vaqari,2,Fri Mar 13 18:14:51 2015 UTC,"On mine, the plastic seemed durable.  I've dropped it on a tile floor a few times without it breaking.  It sounds like it'd be fine?  My problem was my door was too large and there was space for budgie heads to get caught.  How tall is it?  My initial thinking is that it might be a bit short for a cockatiel, but they do lean over when they eat.  You'd probably need a medium if you wanted them to be able to perch upright.  My clumsy boy would probably smack his head on a small, but then he's...special.  I use the small for my budgies."
cockatiel,2yuvvs,maddieface,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the detailed reply!  It's a great sign that it passed the 'fall test', as I like to put it. All my containers have fallen out of my hand at least 5 times by now, considering i've had birds for years.  The one I was looking at says it's 4.2 inches high... Right now mine use plastic little cups with plastic perches attached. they're generally suited for budges but the larger ones for cockatiels are too deep.  They do bend their heads when eating.. I think I'll look more into which size to get though.   Thanks for all the the help! :)"
cockatiel,2yuvvs,justme_3774,2,Sat Mar 14 19:08:52 2015 UTC,"I've got one of those ropes for my two, they seem to love it. It's a bit frayed bit still going strong! It'll definitely do more good for their claws than harm. Definitely recommend getting one.   As for the Tidy Bird, I haven't seen them before but love the concept! Can't hurt to try it out! Though they do seem to get some enjoyment from scavenging food from the bottom of the cage - mine will always deliberately chuck it all over the floor no matter where I put it."

It's like someone sprinkled flour all over the floor. They take a pellet, stick it on top of the feeder, and then bite into it and spray chunks all over the floor.  Glad to know the twisty rope things are okay! My one guy Chester loves to play with stringy stuff (got him a toy with stringy stuff) but he gets so into it I was worried he could injure himself.

The added moisture can weigh down particles in the air to remove them from circulation, not to mention the soothing effect to irritated and dry airways if you have forced heat. Never add any treatment (including essential oils) to the water though, as most put off fumes that are toxic to birds.  By ""grit/cuttlebone"" are you referring to the cuttlebone AS grit, or two separate things? It's my understanding that cockatiels do not need - nor should they have - actual 'grit' as they do not eat seed shells."

cockatiel,2xx3ad,SSJ_Pan,2,Wed Mar 4 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"Hi There!  You cage sounds a good size to me. In terms of what to put in there, that really is entirely up to you. I guess the most important thing (besides food & drink) is making sure the perches are not all processed wood which is the same size. Getting treated branches or something else with variable sizes (like rope) is good. It can hurt their feet to always be in the same grip position. Other than that, having some toys for them to play with is obviously good. Anything they can destroy or eat is good.  With regards to diet, generally speaking a seed only diet is supposed to be bad. Saying that though, my bird is on a mostly seed diet cause she wont touch pellets for the most part. I incude them in her mix and she does occasionally eat them but she prefers seeds. And shes still alive so it cant be all bad! Millet is the ultimate treat for cockatiels. It is the key to their heart. Give it to them often but don't have it in the cage as they will eat nothing else! I have a spray of millet readily available to my bird outside the cage. Make sure you get a calcium block. Its good to help them keep their calcium up (vital if its a female who is egg laying) and they can also grind their beaks on it. Here is a good site for finding out what is safe food and what is toxic.  Birds generally try to hide illness so you will just have to look for subtle signs. Like most animals, not eating or drinking is an obvious one. Also, and I know this sounds odd, but keeping an eye on their poop is another way. Seed eating tiels poop will be greenish, pellet ones will be more brown. All will have white bits in them. If they consistently are pooping different colours or its consistently too liquid then that could be a sign of a problem. Other than that you will just get used to your birds behaviour and be able to spot something out of ordinary.  Cockatiels will generally keep themselves clean via preening but they should be given the oppertunity to wash with water probably weekly. Mine is a stubborn, dirty little thing and rarely does it but I think she is odd in that regard. You can either get a large dish of water out they can wash in or some will shower. You can either spray them with a water bottle if they like that or some other method. And yes they will probably be daft enough to try and drink it first, but they will figure it out.   Hope that helps, feel free to ask more."
cockatiel,2xx3ad,diggory_x,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:53:34 2015 UTC,Thank you very much that's great. Thanks for taking the time to help me :)
cockatiel,2xx3ad,Caffeinated_Coyote,2,Wed Mar 4 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"diggory_x's advice is generally good.  Some things that are bad but are for some reason still sold for parrots: * Sandpaper perches or perch covers.  NO.  These can give them sores on their feet.  You can try one of those rough-textured edible perches.  I've not found that it does much for the claws, but my tiel really likes hers.     Grit.  Don't do it.  Grit is only needed for birds that eat whole seeds.  Parrots hull their seeds (take the shells off).  They don't need grit, and it can give them impactions. Seed-only food mixes.  Yeah, it won't kill them immediately.  But it's like eating McDonald's only.  Low in nutrition, high in fat.  Tiels are prone to getting obese anyway.  You will definitely shorten your bird's lifespan if you feed primarily seed mix.   Pellets are good; I try to shoot for ones that aren't dyed bright colors (because the colors change the color of poop and make it harder to tell when something is wrong).  Tiels eating ONLY pellets often end up with organ damage in the long run, though.  My avian vet recommends pellets (she uses Harrison's, mine prefer Roudybush), with some seeds.  Nutriberries are good too.  My vet actually rotates between feeding Harrison's pellets one day and Nutriberries the next.   Fruits and vegetables are good too, as well as sprouted seed (that you clean and soak so it just barely starts to grow... very healthy). Just make sure you don't feed anything that is dangerous for them (avocado, caffeine, chocolate, some types of uncooked beans).    If you get a bird that is only eating seed and won't eat anything else, you reaaaaally are going to want to change their died.  There are a lot of guides and places for advice on this online, because it's a common problem with birds that were raised on seed.  Usually it involves adding in small amounts of pellets and other foods over time until you can start giving mostly pellets.  (Baking the pellets into bread can help as well).  There's a lot of techniques for this; don't give up.    I tempt my tiel with a lukewarm pan of water.  She usually starts by tasting it and then standing it, but will eventually splash around a bit.  My last tiel didn't like bathing at all.     The poop is the easiest thing to watch for in terms of illnesses.  Learn what healthy poop looks like and go to a vet if it starts looking bad.    Weight is also important to monitor.  You really need a gram scale and to weigh your bird frequently, as they can start losing weight when they are ill, but not have other symptoms.    Make sure your buddy has toys to play with, as well!  They really like to shred things, so those soft wood ""kabob"" toys are nice.  Some really like bells.  I avoid mirrors and go for mostly wooden and natural stuff my bird can rip up. Foraging toys that you can hide treats in are really great, since birds in the wild spend a lot of time looking for their food.    Good luck!!"

This teaches the bird the hand brings good things too and also gets them used to the hand being in close proximity to their little feathered selves. I have trained 4 birds this way, and 2 of them where abused rescue tiels. One would really pierce your finger if you got to close. Now that tiel still hates being handled but she is not fearful of me anymore nor does she bite since the cracker bribery sessions.

cockatiel,2xol2j,diggory_x,4,Mon Mar 2 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"He's probably still quite stressed.  But yeah, eight weeks is kind of young.  A responsible breeder will make sure the babies are feeding themselves for at least a good week before sending them to new homes.    Poor little guy.  Do you have an avian vet nearby?  Or any bird supply stores?  Do you know how she was handfeeding them?  Spoon, syringe, paper cup?  If you don't want to give the bird back and demand a refund, then you may end up having to handfeed him yourself or taking him to someone who knows how to do it.    A gram scale would also be a good investment now if you don't have one.  You can get a digital one for pretty cheap at grocery stores.  You'll want to be monitoring that baby's weight.    I wouldn't worry too much about him today, since he may just be adjusting, but if it looks like he's still not eating tomorrow, it's probably time to take action.  Can you tempt him with any other treats?  A honey stick, some millet?"
cockatiel,2xol2j,Caffeinated_Coyote,3,Mon Mar 2 17:16:24 2015 UTC,She was hand feeding him through a syringe and about a week after she told me he was eating seed by himself is when I picked him up. And I can go pick up some millet to see if that'll perk him up.

Granted, your bird had only been with you for a day and may just be stressed. Keep a very close eye for eating and signs that the bird is getting weak (sitting on the bottom of the cage, not a perch, etc)  My advice is to be prepared to get some formula and supplies.

cockatiel,2xiwt1,brad218,7,Sun Mar 1 15:42:17 2015 UTC,Not with cockatiels. They can replace eggs taken away from them and will essentially lay forever if you take them away. You should only take them away once she stops sitting on them.   Source: I owned a cockatiel that was a chronic egg layer.
cockatiel,2xiwt1,seajellie,3,Sun Mar 1 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"I can verify this. If they are going to lay it is best to let them sit the egg laying cycle out. If they are fertile and you do not want babies you can try replacing the egg with a marble or old eggs. Make sure your bird gets plenty of calcium and vitamin D, as cockatiels in particular are prone to chronic egg laying and by extension egg binding."

Now, on my vets recommendation, I mix an avian vitamin/nutrient mix into his water. I definitely recommend trying to get him/her to eat properly before resorting to this though.   I will also add that tiels tend to take an interest in what we eat. I've had minor success in getting mine to eat certain things after he sees me enjoying it from my shoulder. Worth a shot I guess."

If she can't lay and needs it taken out it will be a surgery where they put her to sleep and break up the egg from inside after sucking all the egg insides first.  What I suggest is, in the mean time, give her a warm bath bowl in/near her cage to add humidity. Also, get a heating pad and clothespin it up to the back of her cage to keep her warm as it helps in the laying."

cockatiel,2x9whd,iLLyNoiZe,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"It sounds like just a period of adjustment to me, but I'm glad you are taking him to a vet. It all must be terribly exciting for him and a bit scary too. Keep me posted!"
cockatiel,2x9whd,Misspissyoants,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"If he's awfully scratchy, he might have some kind of mites. Does he look like he is missing a lot of feathers? Check particularly around the head, neck and beak areas.   My kakariki had mites, and she was very well behaved and sat on her perch a lot. As soon as she was cured she was like a different bird and wouldn't sit still! So if it is mites, it must be horrible to have as it can completely change a bird's presonality."

cockatiel,2x7ya3,cutehulhu,4,Thu Feb 26 10:26:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely was a good idea to toss a towel over him.  I hope that he didn't get injured in his panic, also, good idea in taking him to the vet just in case anyways.  Birds are notorious for hiding it when they're hurt.  Either way, hope he's just fine with no injuries."
cockatiel,2x7ya3,Malted_Shark,3,Thu Feb 26 13:08:49 2015 UTC,"If your bird is so scared that he flies away from you in a panic, you should keep him clipped until he is tamed. It's safer for him and will speed the bonding process. The vet would be happy to do a wing clip while you're there. Start with 4 primaries from each wing, progress to 5 or 6 if he's still achieving lift."
cockatiel,2x7ya3,Shiny_Rattata,4,Thu Feb 26 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"I'm such a jerk in these situations. I would have left mine there until they got hungry to pop out.  Mine quickly learned about the ""foot elevator."""
cockatiel,2x7ya3,xUnderoath,3,Thu Feb 26 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"Sadly, if he's scared of you and your hands, your best option might be someone reaching from him from one side, therefore scaring him away, then you catch him from the other side."
cockatiel,2x7ya3,diggory_x,3,Thu Feb 26 10:32:23 2015 UTC,"This happened to my 'tiel before she became tame so I understand your panic. You did the best thing by chucking a towel over him. Seems a little cruel and difficult at the time but it helps get him back in his comfort zone (cage) and calm down sooner. I'm sure he will be fine, my one has flown into stuff before and bounced off with no problems.  Good luck."

I had him from elementary school until two years after I graduated college... It is so hard losing a pet you've bonded with for such a long time.   I had some of his ashes made into a necklace that I wear from time to time, and also had an artist paint a watercolor portrait of him that I keep in my room. Having some lasting mementos helped me feel better, because I know he'll never be forgotten."

cockatiel,2x0uti,obinice_khenbli,2,Wed Feb 25 00:35:52 2015 UTC,It's good! BB took to it pretty quickly (although the hanging perch that it came with was no good for him)  It's very good if your bird likes to climb up and all over their cages as its got some interesting shapes to it too :)
cockatiel,2wz4pk,bjjKrinkel,3,Tue Feb 24 10:00:18 2015 UTC,Thanks Maxwell! He's not shy at all to talk.

cockatiel,2wvpin,viva1992,8,Mon Feb 23 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"My cockatiel used to bump her beak during night frights, and the first time she scraped it between her nostrils enough for a bit of blood like this I freaked out and was super worried and thought she broke her beak, when I called my vet they gave me the following advice. Just make sure he has a nice calm day and try to keep him from flying so his little heart isn't rushing blood to the spot and causing bleeding. Change his water whenever you can because drinking will help him keep crud off of it. If it is actively bleeding now, or starts to, get him to a vet right away. If it's just a little red like it looks like in your pic, just baby him like you always do and he'll be fine. Extra scritches today if you can! Your little pal should be fine :)"
cockatiel,2wvpin,Scorpinox85,3,Mon Feb 23 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! Yes, its not bleeding so we didnt take him to the vet. His skin is just exposed..? Just concerned over infections, so we are cleaning his cage thoroughly. Will monitor it and pay him extra attention today like you said. Thanks again :)"
cockatiel,2wvpin,natureabstract,3,Mon Feb 23 16:43:46 2015 UTC,He had a nightscare and injured himself. Heres another view.  http://i.imgur.com/a9ZWfvP.jpg
cockatiel,2wvpin,Drugonaut,3,Mon Feb 23 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"Poor guy! This has happened to one of my birds and he healed within half a week. I very gently swabbed the area with a wet q-tip and he seemed to find this soothing--I don't think all birds would let this happen, mine is particularly cuddly. If yours will let you though, I'd give it a try to get the area nice and clean. Don't use anything but water on the area. I agree with scorpinox85--keep the water changed because that's the best opportunity for the cut to be cleaned if the q-tip doesn't work out.   Good luck! Don't underestimate the power of cuddles and scritches for healing."
cockatiel,2wv7mq,spryes,11,Mon Feb 23 12:57:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say obsessed like I go out of my way to sniff the bird but when she is sitting on my chest or something close enough for me to smell her, I do find the smell comforting in the same way any familiar smell does (IE. your bedsheets, pillow etc.)."
cockatiel,2wv7mq,diggory_x,4,Mon Feb 23 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"I don't like the beak smell as much.  But their feathers smell so nice and floury, kind of like unbuttered popcorn or some other kind of grain.  I tend to nuzzle and kiss my cockatiel a lot, and I definitely love that fluffy bird smell. It's nicer than the plain feather smell of my conure.  (And cockatiels are soooo soft.  I end up with little birdy fluffs on my face all the time because of how much I love to snuggle my face up to the soft fluffiness... thankfully my tiel is super cuddly and loves to snuggle me too.)"
cockatiel,2wv7mq,Caffeinated_Coyote,5,Mon Feb 23 14:46:06 2015 UTC,"I do love that fluffy smell.   On another note, Pumpkin loves cilantro, and I always tell him he better be a good bird because he smells delicious after having a snack of cilantro!"
cockatiel,2wv7mq,theySEEmeTROLL1N,3,Mon Feb 23 14:59:54 2015 UTC,I love the way they smell!  Its so hard to describe to people...like sweet dusty grain...almost bread like?  And I think their breath smells good too!  I like it when they yawn in my face which is a lot.  I think the pellets they eat factor in.  I also give them birdy bread and that makes their breath smell great.  Probably super weird...
cockatiel,2wv7mq,superbird11,2,Mon Feb 23 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, i enjoy the natural 'tiel perfume when they're getting scritches and kisses. A bonus of being aware of the smell, is that you notice right away when there's a change in their breath, which could signal an infection. It's always best to treat health issues ASAP, since they tend to hide illness."
cockatiel,2wv7mq,janetplanet,2,Mon Feb 23 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"I thought I was the only person that did this! Whenever we have a scritch session I love to give a nice sniff around the nostrils--such a good smell, for some reason! It's a very comforting smell."
cockatiel,2wv7mq,natureabstract,2,Mon Feb 23 17:50:57 2015 UTC,Haha I thought I was the only one! My absolute favorite thing is when they start playing with my hair while on my shoulders though. Oh god that feeling is the best ever.

cockatiel,2wv7mq,puzzleimpulse,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:49:47 2015 UTC,"There is evidence that hoomans[sic] are still capable of measuring things via our sense of smell.  Basically, the primitive part of your brain is treating them like 'extended family'.  It's a perfectly 'normal' social reaction.  It's only our 'modern' sense of identity that tries to stick the label 'obsessive' on it to try to rationalize what that older part of our brain is doing.  janetplanet is 100% correct, by taking frequent sniffs, you will be well attuned to your bird's health.

Also, I love the smell of my pugs' feet because they smell like fritos and the middle of my husband's chest because it smells like him.  I think if you love something or someone, their scent is the fastest way to make your brain feel happy.  It's why I have a bag of my grandmother's clothes.  She's been gone since 2007, but when I miss her, I can still find her in those clothes.  Your way of processing happiness may be different from someone else's, but it doesn't make it any less or more weird."

cockatiel,2wtki3,KHanau,4,Mon Feb 23 01:14:18 2015 UTC,"It will evntually be molted and a new feather will grow in (Normally, i hope!) , so i wouldn't worry about it unless it's causing Skyfi pain. The fluffy area near it might be an indication that it is bothering  her/him - might be picking at it. If you decide to remove the feather yourself, gently towel Skyfi, and use a good pair of tweezers to grasp the feather as close to the body as possible, and pull it quickly. Have styptic powder (or corn starch, in a pinch) on hand in case of bleeding. I wouldn't pluck it myself unless it's really hurting Skyfi, because birds can go into shock easily."
cockatiel,2wtki3,janetplanet,5,Mon Feb 23 03:32:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't bother her, she's far more interested in demanding scritches and then nibbling my fingers when she's displeased with my scritching technique."
cockatiel,2wtki3,DerpinPony,2,Mon Feb 23 10:15:33 2015 UTC,The feather has stuck up as long as my niece has had Skyfi but I'm more concerned now there's a fluffy patch below it. I've already emailed the only vet in the state that's avian certified to see about a cockatiel screening.
cockatiel,2wtuir,spryes,5,Mon Feb 23 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"he is so cute! Our two are clipped and always have been, given your luck over the years, keeping him clipped might be the best way to go :) get an avarian vet to do it until you are comfortable doing it yourself. An avarian vet knows exactly where to clip it to. I've been to a vet/pet shop to get my birds done and they clipped one of them way to short, poor thing dropped like a lead weight!"
cockatiel,2wtuir,Ladytsun,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:33:45 2015 UTC,I don't clip my birds wings but I'm extremely cautious with what I have in my house and who. If you've had as much trouble as it seems and can't control his environment completely you might keep them clipped.

I don't have my birds clipped as they are great flyers and I feel that it gives them more opportunity for exercise and a sense of their...bird-self?  Not sure how to explain that, but it seems like it keeps them healthier.  As long as you monitor them when they're out and make your house as bird-safe as possible (keep off all ceiling fans for example) then flighted birds are great!  Also, since he is already tame, you won't have the issues some people have trying to tame a flighted bird."
cockatiel,2wtuir,superbird11,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"So cute~!  I personally don't like the idea of clipping birds wings, and don't clip my birds wings as it doesn't limit them and help keep them from becoming overweight.  But if you feel that he'd be safer, and you can still keep him happy, etc(which I have no doubt you'll be able to), then I'd say it might be a good idea so long as it's done properly."
cockatiel,2wtuir,Malted_Shark,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:04:23 2015 UTC,We have done both. On the one hand it makes for a closer relationship if he is clipped. He gets really cocky when he can fly. It is also safer for him if he is clipped. He actually got injured once when not clipped.

I have tried giving her treats by hand and she'll peck at it but then immediately back away. It's almost like she wants to trust me but she's still very unsure. I don't know at all if she was socialized with her previous owner but she got up on my hand and shoulder the day I met her so she seemed semi ok with people."
cockatiel,2wtqlp,legomymeggo,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:01:30 2015 UTC,"She'll come to you. I've found my bird to be incredibly social, at some point she'll start wanting interaction. Just continue to be there without being a threat and she might start showing interest. I know my bird loves when I whistle to him, maybe try teaching her some tunes!"
cockatiel,2ws7ro,Totuto,2,Sun Feb 22 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"I bought the ""Creative Foraging Systems Foraging Sphere"" last week. I think it's supposed to be for birds that are 'beginner' foragers since it's not difficult to figure out. The description said it was good for cockatiels, so I bought it, but it's a little too big. The slots are more designed to hold treats for larger birds, in my opinion (although I was picturing using seeds with it, instead of spray millet). So instead of a foraging toy, I took apart another toy I had, and put all the colorful shiny pieces in there, and attached them to dangle from it. I also put cut-up paper towel roll on the skewer part to make it more interesting. Whenever that gets old for my bird, I'll take it all apart and try putting spray millet pieces in there. That should be big enough to not immediately fall out of the slots.  From everything I've read- it is a good idea! Wild birds spend a lot of time finding food, so they're at a big risk for getting bored if it's always simply given to them. If you don't have a foraging toy, at the least you can buy extra food cups and put them in a different spot each day, including harder to reach spots. Putting the food in the same exact spot every day probably isn't very stimulating for a bird.  I'd like to hear what other cockatiel owners do for foraging too. A lot of these foraging toys seem to be geared towards the larger parrots."
cockatiel,2ws7ro,squeekypig,2,Sun Feb 22 22:52:08 2015 UTC,"I have this foraging toy that makes Strat have to pull these tabs back and forth to slowly work millet down.  But I definitely think you shouldn't use them instead of normal bowls but use both.  I'll also hide his favorite treats in hard to reach, but smellable/visible places so he has to crawl around my room and hunt and search for his favorite treats.  I'm also tempted to ask my grandpa to make something similar to this foraging hut since Strat LOVES to chew/shred up wood, but I'm not sure how well it'd work."
cockatiel,2ws7ro,Malted_Shark,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:01:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome idea with hiding treats around the house, will definitely do that!"

cockatiel,2wq8dg,ILiveInAVillage,4,Sun Feb 22 03:59:18 2015 UTC,"He's likely entering bird puberty.  Cockatiels reach it at 5-7 months old.  He's just overly hormonal and doesn't know what to do with himself.  Getting him more sleep (12 hours or so) might help a bit.  Otherwise it's kind of just a thing.  He'll outgrow it pretty quick.  Respect his boundaries and he'll come back around.  Based on his behavior, he might be viewing you as a mate, so if possible it might be good to distance yourself from him for a little bit."
cockatiel,2wq8dg,vaqari,4,Sun Feb 22 08:14:22 2015 UTC,"He might be getting ready to molt. Our Flash always gets cranky when it's ""that time""."
cockatiel,2wq8dg,TWFM,5,Sun Feb 22 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"He doesn't want to get off your shoulder. Cockatiel bites don't hurt, just make him setup no matter what. I'll go over and make mine step up and move them, put them in cage, take them out of cage, etc several times a day just to make sure they know I am alpha. Cockatiels live in huge colonies and they boss each other around. You have to let him know this behavior isn't acceptable. If mine flies away from me when I take him out (like step up, come out, immediately fly off) I will make him step up again (if he's being naughty I might have to tire him out) then put him back in the cage. Rinse and repeat until he knows not to leave my finger until I put him on the playstand. I don't let mine on my shoulder very often either since it's hard to get them off there. I prefer a knee."
cockatiel,2wq8dg,happycheese86,2,Sun Feb 22 06:19:24 2015 UTC,"Having a 'tiel on your shoulder often can send mixed messages, it makes them feel dominant.

cockatiel,2wo0zg,Richard_Punch,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"Also there's a spray you can get... Grannick's I think is an OK brand. It tastes bad, you spray the feathers, no more picking usually."
cockatiel,2wo0zg,GoldenRemembrance,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:42:05 2015 UTC,"Um...feather picking is usually a neurosis behavior. It indicates boredom, anxiety, or pain. This case above sounded like molting, but if it hadn't been, it would have been best treated by changing her environment, such as more toys, more outside time, or more interaction. Or it could have been due to a skin condition that made her itchy.   Birds need to preen and do it often to spread the oil from the gland at the base of the tail to the feathers to make them waterproof. How does this spray affect that? Is it temporary? If it is temporary, how does it stop the picking? Why would you just use a spray?   Unless it's a Macaw and seems to be doing it out of spite to the owner for leaving them during the day, or some other behavioral issue that seems self destructive, why would you use the spray?"
cockatiel,2wo0zg,Richard_Punch,0,Sun Feb 22 02:51:49 2015 UTC,"Usually it's used if a bird is picking bald, to discourage that harmful behavior. Preening is normal, a bald, bleeding bird isn't. Talk to your vet with any concerns and before trying any home remedies."

cockatiel,2wn4dp,thegreatshandini,2,Sat Feb 21 09:04:36 2015 UTC,"Unless her name existed only on paper, she knows her name.  I've had my two (who are also just about 18 mo old), for just under a year.  They're just like toddlers, they know their names, and they understand the inflection that accompanies it being spoken.  My birds know 3+ languages... Cockatiel, English, Budgie, and a bit of Japanese (I'm an anime fan).  They also know all the noises the house makes and take cues from the front door, furnace, fridge, stove, faucets, oil-delivery man, etc...  Our birds came with the monikers ""Friendly""(m) and ""Freckles""(f) -- not my fav's nor first choices, but absent a deep need to change their names they stuck.  But they also have nicknames, which they know every bit as well as their given names, so I would say you can probably get away with calling her whatever you want, and be rewarded with Cockatiel friendship, regardless of what you call her.    Oh, and you should try to be perceptive to the name she gives YOU -- Yes your bird will reciprocally assign you a name, and you are expected to learn it!  My wife is: ""birdie birdie birdie"" and a trill, my daughter is: ""rock-and-roll"" accompanied by some telescoping head movements, my son gets a single 'popcorn' sound, and since they spend all day with me I seem to be expected to be telepathically connected to the flock."

She is hissing if we get too near her.  I just sit quietly by her cage and talk to her softly, she watches me intently and moves to the side of her cage closest to me if I move across the room. I am hoping in a few days she will become more vocal and less hissing."
cockatiel,2wn4dp,CTYANKEE44,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"Patience.  There's really nothing you can 'do' to substitute for the passage of a little time.  When I got my two, once the cage was located in my office, I barely acknowledged them for the first several days.    On the 2nd day I took them out of the cage and set them on top, and that was it.  The food & water was there, and I was at my desk.  They sat, they stared, I would move, they would jump, but I went about my business as it they weren't there.  They got to see what I did in my office, and they quickly realized that I wasn't a threat.  On day 2, I put them in the cage when it got dark, refilled their food & water, turned off the lights, and closed the door.  On the 3rd morning, I opened the cage door, and they both came out and walked up my arm and sat on my shoulder.    I think that this was the most critical time.  I didn't then try to grab, rub, snuggle, or even pet them.  I spoke to them, and moved them to their cage when I needed to move.  A few days later I was posting on this site asking how I could get them to stay OFF my shoulder for more than 10 minutes at a time!!!   :)  Today, they're family, and from their perspective, I'm 'FLOCK'.  Please consider that my experience is with a PAIR, and from what I've read, it's different with one.  My two are sibs and were bonded to each other.  I am their 3rd home, and they are STILL hesitant to be touched or be scritched.  I can approach them, they will climb, fly to me, land, eat from my plate and my hand, preen my eyebrows, ears, try to eat from my mouth, etc...  They are perfectly comfortable with the whole family, they simply don't care to be rubbed.  But they do like to be chased and teased. Friendly also likes to joust/swordfight! He has a lollypop stick that he grabs out of my pencil holder and I counter with a tailfeather.  The match goes until the stick falls on the floor or rolls under the computer.  Freckles is far more reserved.  She will sit on my forearm and preen and rapidly swish her tail from side to side all day long if I let her.  She speaks infrequently, but when she does, it must be profound."

cockatiel,2wbvzx,squeekypig,3,Wed Feb 18 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"You're probably going to have to convert your tiel over to pellets before he'll start just willingly eating them. When I got mine he was on a seed and romaine lettuce diet, which is hardly that healthy. What I did was mix his seeds and pellets together so he has to pick through the pellets to get the seeds, and then I slowly increased the ratio of pellets to seeds. My Cyril went on to pellets fairly easily that way. Once I was sure he was eating pellets, I separated them again. His seeds are in a bowl higher up in the cage (so he has to climb to get them) and that bowl is only refilled in the morning with a specific amount, whereas his pellets are always refilled as needed. At this point he eats more pellets than he does seeds - I even find about half the seeds aren't shelled the next morning because he's too busy chowing down on pellets.  Just make sure you aren't starving your bird - make sure you watch to make sure he's actually eating pellets (not just crumbling them) and don't completely take the seeds out or anything until you know for sure he'll be fine eating pellets.  I feed Cyril a pellet mix of Zupreem pellets (both colored and plain - parakeet size because he had issues crushing the cockatiel size) and Roudybush maintenance crumbles.  His seed mix was a vitamin-enhanced one which I mix crushed nutriberries into every once in a while because there's a higher chance he'll get more vitamins from those as he doesn't have to shell the seeds. Though I'm switching to a Zupreem seed mix that also has some dried fruits/veggies and things in it to see if he likes that.  As for veggies, it really depends on the bird. Cyril loves romaine lettuce, but outside of that the only veggies he'll eat are frozen corn and peas (check ingredients on frozen stuff to make sure there's no salt or anything). I try to feed him stuff from whatever my family cooks if it's bird safe, but I have yet to get him to touch rice, pasta, eggs, fresh fruits, chicken, or any other types of greens/veggies. Sooner or later I'm sure I'll get him to eat something, you just sort of need to be relentless with it. Just make sure you check a list of safe foods for birds - off the top of my head onion, garlic, avocado and the like are poisonous to them, and there's a lot of other things.  You can also try to make a ""toy"" out of veggies though. Put a bunch of different greens together with different textures to sort of encourage playing with (and maybe eventually eating) them. Though I will say that very few cockatiels seem to eat fruits. Some certainly do, but the majority seem to be veggie birds from what I've seen. Which isn't necessarily bad - less sugar.    People do tend to recommend getting another bird if you aren't at home often seeing it relieves stress as birds are flock animals. However, while I was in college and working Cyril seemed to be fine when I was gone a good portion of the day as I would always get him out when I got home and occasionally my schedule would allow me to stop home for a half hour or so to spend time with him. If you do get a 2nd bird, however, you may want to keep them in separate cages. We currently have a bird room with five birds, so they can all talk and whistle at each other and such, but the two birds that are in the same cage (a pair of female Amazons) refuse to bond with us, whereas the singularly caged birds we have had very little issue with getting to bond to at least one of the family. It may be a coincidence, but there just seems to be fewer issues with each bird having their own cage. There's less risk of coming home and finding that one bird beat up the other one. My tiel was beat up pretty bad before I brought him home, and that was by his brothers and sisters with the parents. He had big bite marks out of his wings and such, so we probably picked him out just in time before he got really bad.  I don't know much about age difference though. There is a hormonal period that a ton of birds go through, and they can sometimes get really nasty at that point, but if they are in separate cages there will be less to worry about with that. You do need to watch illness though. Most people recommend a quarantine period of 30-60 days of any new birds, preferably on an opposite side of the house where you don't need to worry about cross contamination. We personally didn't do the quarantine period, but we also accept that we were probably very lucky, especially seeing only one of our five birds was from an actual verified breeder. Cyril came from a fellow whose pair of tiels just happened to have babies, and the cockatoo and amazons were rehomed with us.    I have a similar carrier to the one xdeadlykittenx posted. It has worked well. Just really watch the bar spacing on any cages you get. Tiels can squeeze their heads through wider bars and get stuck. Most sources tend to recommend no more than 1/2 inch to 5/8 inch.  And Cyril hisses when I first throw the cover over the cage, but he stops after it's actually on. A nightlight may help. One is sometimes recommended because it helps to prevent night terrors and such. He may be seeing shadows or something and that's what is freaking him out."
cockatiel,2wbvzx,LostEventide,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"I did try to pix seeds and pellets, but he was picking out the seeds and not eating the pellets. I will try to do what you said about gradually increasing the amount of pellets, but I just feel like it's a waste throwing out uneaten pellets every day :/ It seems like a balancing act that I'm still figuring out, because I don't want to starve him like you say, but I also don't want to feed him too many seeds. I haven't thought of frozen corn and peas! I'll have to try that, since those are relatively easy to prepare. In my mind I thought fruits would be easy to get a bird to eat. I just assumed that they'd be attracted to the sugar like other animals, but like other animals, sugar is bad so it's probably a good thing my little guy isn't interested. I think you may have caused me to be even more undecided about getting a second cockatiel... haha. I just ordered a large cage over the weekend, and it'll be plenty big enough to house a couple or more with room to spare. So hopefully they wouldn't get territorial, because they would both have their own corners and perches to go to, with plenty of toys... I don't know much about this hormonal period, I'll have to look into that. We were planning on having a new bird quarantined at first if we get it. I would move the new bird into the big cage when it got tame and comfortable with me, but not before then. We're going to try a sheet over the cage tonight as a cover instead of a blanket. I do keep a salt light on at night across the room, so hopefully night terrors won't be a problem! Thanks for your reply :)"

Then I allow them to choose their 'topping' --  They can choose from Turmeric, Paprika, Chili powder, or split peas.    The 'mix' I'm referring to is '8-in-One' brand, and has consisted of either 'Universal' or 'Cockatiel' or 'Cockatiel & Lovebird', all of which they've taken to with gusto!  I also supplement with pressed honey seed treats, nutriberries, spray millet, broccoli, spinach, dandelion, and their new favorite... cantaloupe rind -- yes they'd rather eat the rind than the fruit -- go figure?  They also love cheese, Cheerios, and Costco apple strudel &  croissant.

I give my birds one vegetable a day like kale, mustard green, collard green, broccoli, dill, spinach, endive and other few. Maybe your bird isnt so comfortable enough to try those yet but will get better. Even if he/she does not eat it, still hang a small amount in the cage. I also give them brown rice, boiled egg whites, boiled chicken and pasta sometimes. Seeds and millets are only used as treats or to train them  Companion: All cockatiels have different personalities.

cockatiel,2w8m3s,cocky-scot,5,Tue Feb 17 22:47:50 2015 UTC,"He was a rescue - found in a situation of neglect by a friend of a friend when he was less than a year old, something like ten cockatiels in one tiny cage. Based on how skittish and easily frightened he is, I suspect there may have been abuse involved too. :( Said friend rescued them herself and worked on finding good homes for them, which is where I came into the picture. The first few months were rough and he didn't want to have much to do with me, but I moved slowly and that persistence gradually started paying off.  Introducing Ittybit, who was from a pet store and well-adjusted, a year later was both a blessing and a curse; Tiny was almost instantly happier when he had a friend (I suppose he was used to having other 'tiels around), but I made the mistake of not giving them enough time apart before I introduced them and they bonded to each other instead of to us. She still likes just about everyone (except my BCC), and she definitely helped him in that he would watch her interact with us and realize that no, that scary hand isn't going to eat him. We moved eight months after that - I'm realizing now that my timeline is off and I've had Tiny for three years, not two.  Anyway, the move may have affected the trust level a bit too, but since we've all settled in they've both been consistently happy to see us - we get sang at in the morning or when we get home, and they come over to see what I'm doing. There has been consistent progress in socialization over time, but while Itty will land on my arm/shoulder/head and crawl all over me, Tiny's always been much more hesitant to do anything involving physical contact. He'll ride on my hand from room to room, sometimes, and I could get him on my shoulder occasionally, but heaven forbid I move and even then it usually lasts less than a minute. Walking around with him, moving between rooms, etc. has always been out of the question - until today, when I not only sat down with him at my desk, but also got up, moved into the kitchen, poured a glass of lemonade and came back. His crest went up a bit but where he would have previously taken off, he stayed right where he was! :D"

cockatiel,2vps14,Misspissyoants,3,Fri Feb 13 01:32:01 2015 UTC,preening after baths can cause watery poops
cockatiel,2vps14,CTYANKEE44,2,Fri Feb 13 07:18:08 2015 UTC,Yes have seen that after showering.
cockatiel,2vmqpd,dub_sex,5,Thu Feb 12 07:25:40 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly, it's always better to take him to the vet to be sure.  I noticed one day my bird's rear interior talon was bent forward, I took him to the vet and they said there's nothing really they should do so long as he is still getting around fine and is capable of perching."
cockatiel,2vmqpd,Mayor_of_Browntown,3,Thu Feb 12 18:13:20 2015 UTC,Is the bird showing signs of pain? Does he usually rest on that foot?
cockatiel,2vmqpd,howdoilinux,3,Thu Feb 12 14:55:08 2015 UTC,Probably? My bird broke his toe- I took him to the vets and they said that since it wasn't bothering him to just leave it. He's now got one permanently floppy toe that wiggles around if you flick it but he's not in any pain at all. Take your guy to the vet but don't worry too much!
cockatiel,2vkyxi,Gunlord500,4,Wed Feb 11 21:49:48 2015 UTC,I used to do this to my cockatiels so that they'd learn to preen each other. But both of them were selfish and only wanted me to preen them!

cockatiel,2vk4fl,PennyLaane,3,Wed Feb 11 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"I used an infrared heat panel from Avitec: http://www.avitec.com/Cage-Heaters-AviTemp-Infrared-Heat-Panels-s/50.htm  It was great. I bought a sensor to go with it and kept it next to the panel. I kept the panel at about 75 degrees and that kept the cage comfortable. The sensor would turn the panel on/off to keep it constant. I also put a perch running perpendicular to it so that if she got closer to the panel I could tell that maybe she was chilly/ill.   It's pricey, but worth the peace of mind."

cockatiel,2vg087,MontanaMisanthropy,17,Tue Feb 10 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"This is an awful idea. Parrots don't have the sort of homing instinct that will let them come back if they get spooked. If they fly off, that's it. They're gone and most likely dead.  Birds should never, ever be allowed outdoors without a flight suit or harness or a cage. EVEN CLIPPED BIRDS CAN FLY. I've seen this a lot on this sub and it's dangerous and downright stupid. It's not worth putting your birds life at risk for a cute picture."
cockatiel,2vg087,DrsansPhD,7,Tue Feb 10 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"SECONDED!  When I first got my cockatiel I clipped her wings and would let her outside with me. One day something fell on the porch, spooked her, she caught wind and landed in the middle of the pond behind my house. Luckily I was able to swim out and get her. I never let her outside without being in her travel cage anymore (she hates harnesses)."
cockatiel,2vg087,abieeiba,2,Tue Feb 10 23:51:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. I mean yes, its cool and impressive when it comes back to you, but is it really worth risking his/her life? No matter how much you think your tiel loves you, he can still fly away and get lost. You wouldnt leave your small child alone in the middle of nowhere because it would get lost and love wont help, so why would you do that with bird?"
cockatiel,2vg087,Totuto,5,Sat Feb 21 10:02:42 2015 UTC,"I got a call from a friend, hysterical because she brought her 'tiel outside, and she got spooked and flew into a tree.  I raced over there and while we were trying to coax Lola, she got spooked again and started flying away and a hawk came out of no where and killed her :("
cockatiel,2vg087,jessicamooney,7,Mon Feb 16 03:52:59 2015 UTC,They don't need much wind at all and will be gone forever.
cockatiel,2vg087,Misspissyoants,2,Wed Feb 11 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"Most people who free fly do it with larger birds such as greys, cockatoos, ekkies and macaws. These people also warn against using the smaller birds to free fly."
cockatiel,2vg087,Colorguarder08,2,Fri Feb 13 07:25:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen videos on youtube of it, but it always makes me terrified that a hawk or something would get them!  I'm sure they do a lot of recall training to get that way, that and cage recognition to get them to come back if spooked.    I know I've actually started working on Strat to get him to return to his cage on command/when spooked since he can't go outside on a harness right now.  I figure that even though I inspect the harness before and after every use, accidents happen and I need to train him to be prepared for the worst."
cockatiel,2vg087,Malted_Shark,-5,Fri Feb 20 12:38:58 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm. I was hoping to talk to people who had successfully clicker trained a cockateil to return so they don't get too far away and into danger as I had heard that TRAINED free flying was a thing... I don't appreciate being spoken down to. I don't plan to try any experiments and I'm not looking for a photo Opp. Furthermore I think clipping a birds wings is cruel. It's like cutting off a dogs feet so you don't have to put it on a leash.... and third, taking a bird with clipped wings outside without a leash is just plain cat bait."
cockatiel,2vg087,diggory_x,8,Wed Feb 11 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your assessment on wing clipping, I think you are being a bit of an arsehole with that post. People are trying to warn you of the dangers of allowing cockatiels to free fly outside and you are lashing out with them just because they have told you what you didn't want to hear.   While you may argue that wild cockatiels fly outside fine, the point is pet cockatiels are not wild. They are domesticated. They are used to the boundaries and safety of an indoor home and may not know how to handle a lack of walls or not have the instincts to avoid danger while outside.  That being said, my breeder gave me a piece of golden advice about caring for my tiel. As long as you cover the basics, the right way to care for your cockatiel is your way. If you think your right way is to allow them to fly outside then do it, but to do so without considering the warnings of fellows owners is courting disaster."
cockatiel,2vg087,diggory_x,2,Wed Feb 11 11:51:24 2015 UTC,"I do agree that domesticated cockatiels can't just go outside and fly around. But I wasn't planning to just take my bird out and let him fly. In fact I'm not in any way intending to do that. I was merely asking if anyone on here had trained their bird to free fly, I would like to have a discussion about it. I am lashing out because people who dont know me are litteraly calling me stupid for wanting to concider the possibility of taking my bird outside off leash. not because they are ""telling me what I don't want to here"" but because they are being really condescending. I feel like a lot of people didn't even read my post. In my post I say I'm worried about hawks because tiels are small. And everyone jumping down my throat makes me think people must have just read the headline and commented. The comments don't even feel like they are in responce to any of the questions I posed. I don't know. Thank you for taking the time to read my post and talk to me like a human. I think sometimes people forget to be polite because its much easier to be insulting on a screen than to someone's face. Additionally, I have done more research since posting this, and it sounds like most people arnt free flying their cockatiels because they are just too small. Which I agree with, and agreed with from the begining, I'm still clicker training my pretty boy, which I think is a good idea since I'm not clipping his wings that way if he does manage to get loose he will be trained to return."
cockatiel,2vg087,TurtleGiraffe,4,Thu Feb 12 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I think you are reading more (insults) into the other posts than are actually intended. u/DrsansPhD seems to say that in his/her own opinion free flying a cockatiel is ""dangerous and downright stupid"". He/she didn't say YOU are stupid, just that the concept is due to potential danger to a 'tiels life.  I personally cannot give any opinion on free flying myself as I have never considered it. I am not sure I would even want to take my bird outside with a harness let alone free. But good luck with whatever you decide."
cockatiel,2vg087,PackerFanNYC,2,Thu Feb 12 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"And I agree that my tone was pretty harsh there :/ I guess I felt OK talking that way at the time because that's the way people were talking to me and I wanted to one up them. Not cool. Sorry for being a dick, people."

cockatiel,2vd2zl,BigBadRonni,7,Tue Feb 10 01:23:24 2015 UTC,I went to parrothouse.com and went through their recipes and slightly altered one of the fruit bread recipes.   Kerbal Cake  Main Biscut 1 1/4 cups flour 3/4 cups corn meal 1/8 cups sugar 1/4 veggie oil 2 tsp baking powder 2-4 eggs  Fruit Flavor 1 chopped apple (seeds removed) 1 handful of chopped carrot 1 handful of cockatiel seed mix Add orange juice instead of water for moisture  Mix all together and bake in muffin tray at 350* till toothpick comes out clean.  You can add your bird's favorite fruit and veggies instead of what I did and these store well in the freezer. Just microwave for 30sec and they get warm and spongy.

cockatiel,2vcly6,severon,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:36:58 2015 UTC,"My parakeet and my cockatiel were best buds. They'd fly around together. As for the food, they didn't eat each other's. They had separate bowls."

We found a parakeet in the backyard  few months later. Our cockatiel was female, the parakeet was a mystery. I tried telling by the beak, but it was confusing.   We had separate cages for them to eat, but they'd fly around together and hang out in the big cage. Now I have to go find a picture."
cockatiel,2vcly6,Carosello,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:48:14 2015 UTC,Yay! That makes me happy! I really want another parakeet. I feel like 2 cockatiels might be double trouble...

cockatiel,2vbngf,cocky-scot,2,Wed Feb 11 00:49:27 2015 UTC,"It's kind of mixed, I saw on some places that you should discourage it because they could potentially get an infection if the perch is dirty.

cockatiel,2v7bdk,mbcarl,3,Mon Feb 9 00:04:03 2015 UTC,mine still won't let me give head scratches.  What did you do to talk him into it?
cockatiel,2v7bdk,SherryRJ,2,Sun Feb 15 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"I got him when he was two months old and he was always a bit afraid of hands when outside the cage, but would beg for scratches inside by climbing to the top and pressing his head against the roof bars. Then came ""puberty"" right when he was around 9 months old and... well, he sang and screetched a lot and tried to bite everything within a metre radius, I was amazed how appropriate his name turned out to be. He's now 17 months old and finally calming down. It started with trying to hand-feed him while he was in the cage and a few months ago he finally started eating the seeds instead of biting the hand. Eventually he started asking for head scratches from inside the cage (as he did when he was a baby), and now, when I get him out, he'll only try to bite softly a couple of times before climbing on my finger (instead of flying away when the finger gets anywhere near him), same with scratching his head. Basically hand feeding and waiting out the worst phase of his puberty did the trick."

It's a daunting task, but you do it because you love your bird and you can't imagine leaving her behind.  I wish I was in a position to help you, but I'm not.  However, I would suggest posting over on /r/parrots. It's a slightly bigger community, so you may find someone that's able to help you there. If not, people are really awesome about trying to find resources to help in such situations.   Sorry you've been put in such a situation. I traveled with my cat to the UK some time ago, and was unable to bring him back to the US with me because of his age and medical problems. I haven't seen him in over a year and it's dreadful.   I wish only the best for you."

cockatiel,2v1qro,MikeBenza,5,Sat Feb 7 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"I've brought my cockatiel to Paris and back twice, so I've had to deal with the import/export process.  Last I checked (10 months ago), United is the only airline that allowed in-cabin birds internationally.  So you should probably focus on cities where United has direct flights to Japan that are not in NY or CA.  That's Houston, Denver, and Chicago.  Eliminating a connection by requiring a direct flight will make it easier for you and your bird, so try posting in those cities' subreddits.  Also, contact the USDA, specifically the vets in this announcement.  In my experience they've been ridiculously helpful via email.  I had a question that wasn't answered on the phone so I emailed the USDA.  My email got bounced around to 4 different vets who found the answer for me in 4 hours late on a Friday afternoon.  There's a chance that they'll know some way out of your problem.  They may also have contacts in Japan that they can convince to waive the rules for you if you get a HPAI blood test done while in a quarantine facility or if the bird never leaves USDA care.  (My cockatiel had the HPAI blood test done twice.  It's no big deal.)  You can also ask the USDA to reassign the import quarantine location.  They seem to be flexible and reasonable if you have a complex situation.  Have you considered doing the quarantine in CA, then immediately bringing your cockatiel to a non-affected state?  When you go to Japan, you can then transit CA again.  If you did that, the Japanese may be willing to allow you since you just transited CA with no contact with other birds.  There are often special rules for travelers and animals just transferring in an affected area."
cockatiel,2v1qro,MikeBenza,0,Sat Feb 7 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"United AND Asiana allow it. Yep, I already knew about this. I am flying United entirely already. And yep, I know of the cities that fly direct. Checked out the map when this all started.  And I already asked Japan about contacts to waive the rules. There is no one. It's an automatic process from the CDC. If the CDC releases a report, there is no way around it, Japan ""closes the door"" on that state immediately. I think it's some sort of ""Treatice on the Import of Animals"" that a lot of countries have signed together. There is no upper management I could contact. Wouldn't matter if my bird were President Obama's bird or whatever. She wouldn't come if he was flying with her through any of the infected states.   I have already contacted the USDA, did so immediately. The ONLY three I can use are the three listed, they can't make another quarantine facility in another place. There is no other option for quarantine. They said they were willing to switch my import permit, but since there's no direct flight to anything but New York (which is too risky now), changing would do nothing.   Yes, I have thought about doing the quarantine and then going to a non affected state. That was my first thing I did and I said that in the original post. But the missing factor is TIME. I have two days after quarantine before I have to go to Japan to start my job, can't change the dates of the job start. If I fly again to a new state, I must start the 21 day health check all over again. Because my bird could be ""exposed"" the moment I take her out of quarantine. And no, I'm afraid you're wrong on the whole transiting through CA again. It doesn't matter if I was just transiting and never left the airport. Japan will not accept her if my itinerary says California, no matter if it was 1 hour in Cali or 1 month. Japan's emails to me were very clear on this.   Thanks for your advice, but it just doesn't apply cause I've already done it all or have already received info which makes nearly everything you suggested moot."
cockatiel,2v1qro,Albatrozs,1 point,Sun Feb 8 01:53:46 2015 UTC,"Some countries have different rule about transiting with birds (such as the UK), so I thought Japan might.  I looked a little bit more into it and saw that the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service says that they've banned import of poultry from CA (at the top of the page).  Parrots are not poultry.  That might be a technicality that's being overlooked due to a language barrier or misunderstanding due to the emergent nature of the situation.  I think this is an important distinction that's not being made since this document, though a bit old, clearly defines poultry as ""chicken, duck, turkey, quail and goose.""  This much more recent document defines poultry as ""Chicken, quail, turkey, ostrich, guinea fowl, pheasant and birds classified into Anseriformes order (such as duck and goose),"" which a cockatiel definitely is not.  The document is regarding imports from Sweden, but I doubt the definition of poultry that Japan uses varies from country to country.  Have you considered Guam?  Since it's not a state, it may have different import requirements.  (The pet importation link from the above site seems to imply that.)  It's HPAI free and there are direct flights on United from Seoul to Guam and from Guam to Tokyo."
cockatiel,2v1qro,ashfixit,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Pet birds and Poultry are counted as the same. Stupid, I know! But yep, there's only two types in the law. Wild, and Domesticated. Domesticated is poultry and pet both. So they fall under the same rules. Wish I could change that! You raise a good point about the language barrier, sadly I've already crossed that well and it's pretty well down. I emailed at the beginning (in the paperwork I was checking on before they told me the news) not only the Japanese word for Cockatiel, but a picture of the bird type as well. They know exactly what it is. And yep, it does vary sadly. Thanks for trying with that.  You do give me something to think about with Guam, but with only a week and a half to go, arranging new hotel accommodations (for a month, or at least accommodations for my bird for that long) plus fees for changing the plane ticket and cancelling others, PLUS still packing and shutting things down here, cleaning, selling, and finishing out this last week of of my full time job? While a great idea, the time is once again my most limiting factor and with all that, the money may be too. I'm going to look into it, definitely, cause it's an idea, but it's probably not going to be possible to do due to time. Thanks though for your info and your help trying to find workarounds for me!   Thankfully, so many people have volunteered to keep my bird for me, I'm still going through all of the offers. It might have to end up being that I'll be separated from my bird for just a few months. Depends a lot on if I get that job in Japan. Hopefully I'll find out soon so I can take a big part of worry off my shoulders."

Perhaps getting a premium membership might grease the beak.  please keep us posted - even if it is to drop a toy in the mail to your daughter or even a cage!"
cockatiel,2v1qro,VocePoetica,0,Sun Feb 8 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"I do not want to put her into the state with the infection, and even worse with other birds in a rescue. I do not wish to relenquish ownership of her. Tis better I get her to a non-infected state so the 21 day health check can start there. From there, it'll just be a matter of luck if the state remains infection free. :( Sadly, there are no beaks to grease. I already tried that with Japan - it's some sort of agreement between multiple countries. What the CDC and USDA says, automatically goes for all the countries which have ""signed the agreement"". Thanks, I'll try to keep you all posted on developments."
cockatiel,2v1qro,VocePoetica,2,Sat Feb 7 07:25:34 2015 UTC,"I gave all of them. I know the whole list. I even know the ones that were on the list and have been taken off of it years ago.   California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Michigan and as of 2 days ago, New Jersey. This may change at any moment though, it's not that these are the only 6 states that will have the infection. The infection is confirmed and the same or next day, it is added to the CDC list which then countries immediately ban from bird exports. There's a notification system with immediate notification set up, so it's instant."
cockatiel,2v1qro,Ytheitch,2,Sun Feb 8 01:58:08 2015 UTC,I'm unfortunately unable to help (I'm Canadian) but I wanted to wish you luck in either finding someone take in your tiel or in finding a third road
cockatiel,2v1qro,theySEEmeTROLL1N,2,Sun Feb 8 00:02:13 2015 UTC,"I wish I could help you somehow :\ I just want to let you know my heart goes out to you, I'm hopeful this terrible situation will work out in some sort of satisfying manner."
cockatiel,2v1qro,CTYANKEE44,2,Sun Feb 8 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. I live on the other side of the planet so I'm no use, but please keep us updated!"

cockatiel,2uxq67,The-Jericho,0,Sat Feb 7 17:23:43 2015 UTC,lol i saw an old comment of yours and had to wish you a happy cake day
cockatiel,2usuas,doPiaui,10,Wed Feb 4 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"She's inviting you to mate with her. they lift up their rear end and make those short repetitive squeaky sounds when they're in the mood. My female does it frequently, at which point her mate quickly runs to her aid."
cockatiel,2usuas,Falkner09,3,Thu Feb 5 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"It's actually impressive that she's comfortable enough in her new environment to mate!   Kudos to you, OP."
cockatiel,2usuas,bbbbirdistheword,2,Thu Feb 5 03:49:48 2015 UTC,"Aww thanks! I think the credit is really due to the bird though, she's great."
cockatiel,2usuas,madisonrebel,3,Thu Feb 5 04:19:11 2015 UTC,Thank you. I guess it's officially a she now!
cockatiel,2usuas,DerpinPony,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. Before long she's going to be flying around your home, looking for nooks and crannies to make good nesting areas.  If you want to suppress this stuff(and you do unless you want chicks/eggs), you have to start covering her cage more. Give her less daytime hours. Hormones will especially rise during the seasonal turning points of the year."
cockatiel,2uqnn8,theotherguy96,3,Wed Feb 4 09:29:56 2015 UTC,Does yours love baths too? Mine sits on the shower rod and demands them. She occasionally even shower with us.
cockatiel,2uqnn8,WillsMyth,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:34:33 2015 UTC,"yeah he just loves it, whenever I do the dishes or just wash my hands with him on my shoulder he screams until I let him get in the sink and shower"
cockatiel,2uqnn8,WillsMyth,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:37:52 2015 UTC,Mines not quite there yet. But she's also fully flighted so it's hard to get her to do things like that.
cockatiel,2uqnn8,Misspissyoants,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:54:01 2015 UTC,Cute!
cockatiel,2uq5nh,Areeane,3,Wed Feb 4 05:27:38 2015 UTC,Yay!  I'm so glad Lumi is all better now!
cockatiel,2uq5nh,Malted_Shark,1 point,Wed Feb 4 06:18:06 2015 UTC,Thank you! :) Now that he's all better I'm finally seeing his personality shine through. He's quite chatty and he sings a lot now.
cockatiel,2uq5nh,DerpinPony,3,Wed Feb 4 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"Good for you, Lumi!"
cockatiel,2uq5nh,TWFM,3,Wed Feb 4 12:43:15 2015 UTC,"Aww, what a cutie! Glad he's feeling well!"

cockatiel,2uq5nh,cacille,2,Thu Feb 5 00:19:50 2015 UTC,"wow, i'm glad for you! Lumi looks identical to mine - and I'm sad to say that mine won't be doing so well, with an entirely different situation."
cockatiel,2uq5nh,LingeronmyFinger,1 point,Wed Feb 4 11:40:50 2015 UTC,Thanks! And I'm sorry to hear about your little one :( What's going on?
cockatiel,2urrnj,Mortress,2,Wed Feb 4 17:07:13 2015 UTC,My tiel hardly ever uses his foot for anything. We pin a lot of his food to his cage with a clothespin.
cockatiel,2urrnj,Misspissyoants,2,Wed Feb 4 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"Same here. My old bird used her foot for quite a lot of things, especially to get in trouble. She once stole a pack of matches and actually flew with them gripped in her foot."
cockatiel,2urrnj,30cuts,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"That is good news. I will try that, thanks."
cockatiel,2urrnj,vaqari,2,Sat Feb 7 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Not all cockatiels eat with their foot.  There shouldn't be any problems with her eating anything, as long as she can reach it."
cockatiel,2urrnj,Junothe3rd,1 point,Thu Feb 5 02:43:25 2015 UTC,"My cockatiel has bad feet too. I put her fruit in a clip at beak height, so she can manage even without holding it. She can't eat fruit from her pot.  She did take a while to learn how to do this, but I'm not sure if that's because she wasn't looked after so had probably not eaten fruit before living with me."
cockatiel,2urrnj,Junothe3rd,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"She's actually opposite to yours. She likes sunflower seed if she opens it herself, but will not touch preshelled."
cockatiel,2urrnj,MontanaMisanthropy,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"Can she eat larger things like pasta, cereal, and peanuts from her pot? Do you have some tips for teaching a bird to eat new things like that? The previous owners of my bird didn't give her anything besides seeds and an occasional birdsnack. She thinks I try to poison her when I give her something new."
cockatiel,2upm0o,Bero33,3,Wed Feb 4 02:34:27 2015 UTC,Did she pick the name? It's awesome
cockatiel,2upm0o,Richard_Punch,3,Wed Feb 4 03:05:53 2015 UTC,Yes she did. She names everything the best names. She has a crocodile stuffy named ABC's in Outerspace... gotta love the mind of a child..
cockatiel,2upm0o,Richard_Punch,2,Wed Feb 4 03:41:43 2015 UTC,"That's fantastic. Cockatiels are little dinosaurs, and definite spitfires, so I think it's a very fitting name."

cockatiel,2ukj6k,TPishek,3,Tue Feb 3 01:50:23 2015 UTC,Looks like a flight diaper.
cockatiel,2ukj6k,cocky-scot,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:34:51 2015 UTC,Never heard of that.
cockatiel,2ule4t,TPishek,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:56:53 2015 UTC,"We use the Aviator harness. Not as bulky as a flight diaper (important for these little guys), but does not have any poo prevention. Our birds were cranky the first few times they wore them, but as soon as you have them outside with something else to focus on they perk back up."
cockatiel,2ule4t,Misspissyoants,1 point,Tue Feb 3 12:23:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, how does the tiel feel about it? We trained ours."
cockatiel,2ule4t,Razlyk,0,Tue Feb 3 22:35:15 2015 UTC,More importantly how the hell did you get it on them without them flipping out?
cockatiel,2uh9dd,Malted_Shark,1 point,Mon Feb 2 03:50:47 2015 UTC,Cutie! Love his little smile :)
cockatiel,2uh9dd,Areeane,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:24:04 2015 UTC,Yeah. :)  I can't wait until it warms up so I can take him out to play outside again!
cockatiel,2uehpd,Simply_Mad,2,Sun Feb 1 12:32:43 2015 UTC,My 'tiel kind of looks like that!
cockatiel,2uehpd,alber_t,2,Sun Feb 1 16:10:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing! That is one adorable 'tiel. (But aren't they all?)

cockatiel,2uflp6,round_n_about,3,Sun Feb 1 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"Scritches, dim the lights, put on some music or TV."
cockatiel,2uflp6,cacille,2,Sun Feb 1 23:30:59 2015 UTC,"When the road work starts up again, put on some music. Be happy and say ""good bird"" a lot, calm, cheerful voice, scritches, rewards like millet more, etc. Just distract him!"
cockatiel,2uflp6,AnnOnimiss,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:40:43 2015 UTC,Any environmental changes? Funny sounds?  Was anything burning?
cockatiel,2uflp6,AnnOnimiss,2,Mon Feb 2 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"Road work outside of the apartment ended up being the cause! He's fine now, but the sounds of all the machines freaked him out."
cockatiel,2udvvp,xdeadlykittenx,2,Sun Feb 1 06:21:20 2015 UTC,Yay!  Birdy kisses are the best!  Beautiful 'tiel!
cockatiel,2udvvp,superbird11,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:26:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! Mini is a lovebug. She even lets new people scritch her unlike my other tiel Pearl (I call him Pearly) is a feisty little guy :) But I love them both!! <3
