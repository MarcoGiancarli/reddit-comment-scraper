solipsism,37cgcv,SavageDark,1 point,Wed May 27 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"In English there are three points of view to speak from: First, Second, and Third Person. Each point-of-view is defined as a different yet specific context, or mindset, with which the ""author"" (loose) can discuss themself.   First Person relates to speaking of yourself as if you are yourself. AKA speaker acts as SPEAKER. FP is characterized by the use of personal pronouns I, we, me, my, etc. It is the embodiment of the thing.  Second Person relates to speaking of yourself as if you're another person. AKA speaker acts as LISTENER. SP is characterized by the use of pronouns you and your. It is the confrontation of a thing.  Third person relates to speaking of yourself as someone beyond the situation. AKA speaker acts as OBSERVER. TP is characterized by the use of pronouns such as he, his, she, hers, they, theirs, it, its, etc. It is the mention of a thing.  Example:  FP POV: I was only at the store for fifteen minutes. Yeesh  SP POV: Nah, you were gone for much longer!  TP POV: Actually, FP POV had indeed been away longer than the proclaimed fifteen minutes, but SP POV was more concerned about the food than his friend.  Be warned. The POV can be changing constantly even within a single sentence. It is purely a matter of what subject to which you're paying attention.  ""Please do not try to persuade me into signing onto a major record label. I've heard only bad things have come from people who signed away their life to Universal Music Group.""  and now with the POV's...  ""Please (SP - understood ""you"") do not try to persuade me (FP) into signing onto a major record label. I've (FP) heard only bad things have come from people who signed away their (TP) life to Universal Music Group (TP).""  The speaker clearly has multiple well-defined perspectives he/she/they is employing.*  *Side Note: One might feel compelled to call this a First Person excerpt, but we as readers have too little context to make that assertion. Furthermore, while an over-arching POV can be considered within the proper context, it devalues the other contexts that say there are other perspectives at play.  What is ""Second Person"" given the title (""You're stuck in second person. Help you. Help you. Please. Help you."") and the context of presence (We're in the Solipsism subreddit, a place all about the notion that one can only know of one's self and treating all others/everything as if they are just different imaginings of one's own invention.)? First, to be stuck in second person as a Solipsist is more of an existential qualm that is well beyond discussion here, but suffice it to say it addresses the issues that arise from a whole new angle of attack. To approach yourself as if you were someone else is the crux of the title. The gross implications, as here-else mentioned, are from the notion there is no one Else.  Questions? Ask 'em.  Cheers. :)"

Then someone else would. This idea flies directly in the face of our egos though. We tell ourselves that the importance of our existence is basically infinite (the denominator of the ridiculously large number they came up with at the end). Right? Otherwise who cares if the probability of our existence is basically zero? Sure if I didn't exist, then I would be unaware of my nonexistence. I wouldn't have had a single thought or feeling. My story would be naught. I would just be a potential. But the reason that thought bothers me is because it threatens my sense of survival. The aforementioned large number (or one of them) is the number of potential humans. Any one of them could have existed in place of me. What makes me so special? The death or nonexistence that my ego is so afraid of is something that countless humans are ""experiencing"" right now.  Don't get me wrong. I love the deep feeling of awe that thinking of how lucky I am to exist at all elicits. I just wanted to provide the closest approximation to the universe's perspective I could come up with."

Basically the only way anyone can make the observation in the infographic is if all the conditions that are required for you to exist have been met. Anyone who could observe their existence would observe a similar set of ridiculous odds, thus it is impossible for anyone to observe life and to not have faced these odds for existing in the first place.  You're not special, and the universe wasn't created for the purpose of you existing. It's just that in order to exist, all this shit had to happen.

As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that the universe's fundamental constants happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.      Image i     Relevant: Frank J.

It also kind of ties into a different theory, which is actually quite possible, maybe even probable, that all of our perspectives are 100% different. Not just our views on things, but the actual things we 'know'. For example, one person's sight could be another's taste, where they neurally perceive the signals from their eyes in a form that someone else feels taste. And colors could be completely different to every single person, if an object is brown to one person, and another person knows it is brown, but sees it as another person's blue, there is no way to tell if they are actually seeing the same thing. In this sense, there really are no truths to the universe, everyone has their own version of it that they experience. Maybe one person feels the sensation of falling as someone else feels being pushed. Every single person could have their own version of the universe that they experience individually, and everyone interacts with and impacts the universe (By speaking, doing things, and even simply existing) but no two people share the same universe in terms of perception."

It only helps foster the illusion that I am different from and work against myself, instead of always with myself. That should be clear. Eventually I will simply manifest it.   I no longer need them, but I know a few tricks that can slow thought to nil. What is most important is that they are just refreshed and retained.  Thought could simply turn into gibberish. It becomes almost musical. When it ceases to be interesting though, fixation on it in particular will cease.  I could break down the illusion they belong to 'me.' Manifest them in a familiar voice, at which point the focus of attention is equally on the sound of the voice rather than the content of the thought. It's a shorter distance from there to disregarding it entirely.   Attention could be redirected, but this requires the most persistence and patience because of how quickly words resurface at the beginning. I would attention elsewhere anyway each time as necessary, until there was gradually less focus on thought and more on what happened in the silence in its gaps, widening them. Breathing, or a sensation, or a sound.   I never knew how absorbed in it my attention had always been until it finally dropped off."

solipsism,321389,zamuy12479,22,Thu Apr 9 23:18:03 2015 UTC,"The universe only exists to fill my perception.  Once I ""die"", it would serve no purpose.  It would be incomplete without me.  You have nothing to worry about because you do not perceive the ""universe"" in the same way I do.  What you consider ""thoughts"" and ""observations"" are merely programs that you follow to create a richer world experience for me."

solipsism,321389,caravax,3,Fri Apr 10 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"So in a solipsistic view, the universe is not just the viewer's imagination, but really there when they are not around, and centered around creating their perception of the world?"

solipsism,321389,Nunshense,2,Thu Apr 9 22:28:18 2015 UTC,What if you never die?
solipsism,321389,theghostecho,2,Thu Apr 9 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"It would actually depend on the type of solipsism. In metaphysical solipsism, all that exists is one's mind. Everything else is a representation of yourself, and only exists in your own mind, they don't exist by themselves. So yes, in this case, the universe would absolutely cease to exist.  In Epistemiological solipsism, one does believe it is possible that the world and other people exist, but that it is not possible to be certain. To summarize it, one believes that the only way to really know that other people are separate from oneself, is to be that person, or see through it. So you can't be sure they aren't just you.  There is another form of solipsism called Methodological solipsism but it is basically a completely different belief. I don't know much about it, so I'll quote.   First definition: Methodological solipsism is the epistemological thesis that the individual self and its states are the sole possible or proper starting point for philosophical construction (Wood, 295). A skeptical turn along these lines is Cartesian skepticism.  Second Definition: Methodological solipsism is the thesis that the mental properties or mental states of an organism can be individuated exclusively on the basis of that state or property's relations with other internal states of the organism itself, without any reference to the society or the physical world in which the organism is embedded."

solipsism,321389,chumbuckit,-2,Mon Jun 8 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"I reckon not. Although you are the protagonist of your story look around, there are many others stories around you.
