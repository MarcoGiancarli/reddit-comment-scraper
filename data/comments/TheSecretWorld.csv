TheSecretWorld,3e362w,Pointyteef,5,Tue Jul 21 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"Good thing about this game is your role mostly determined by your gear. If your all gear is Atack raiting, you're dps. If it's heal raiting, you're a healer. If you have +6k hp and block raiting, you're tank. Of course your skills also determine your role but gears effect your skills effectiveness.  Polaris is the easiest dungeon in the game. So you shouldn't really worry too much about it. Just be sure to have a healer."
TheSecretWorld,3e362w,flamingmushroom,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:26 2015 UTC,You could probably go in as tank or DPS with that build.  I wouldn't sweat it too much.  Polaris normal is a pretty forgiving dungeon.
TheSecretWorld,3e362w,WingedNazgul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"Well, right now you have a sort of hybrid tank/lots of self heals. You might be able to tank Polaris normal,  but I've never done tanking (I'm a healer primarily), so your milage may vary. I would suggest looking at tswdb.com to find a pure dps build or a pure tank build. That site has tons of builds and has a section for budget builds if I recall. In solo play, you'll use a ""survival build"", which uses a mix or talisman types. If you look up my chronicle, which is the same as my reddit name, you'll see my build and equips are a mix, that's my solo build. I would recommend getting a good instance dps build for the future . I'm on mobile, or I would have given better links. Good luck and enjoy Tsw!"
TheSecretWorld,3e362w,Teamfrag,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"For polaris normal, if you pug the group through the LFG tool you'll find that the highest dps will usually be the tank. Nothing hits very hard in normal so you should be fine as long as you have a dedicated healer.   It might be hard for you to find a group with the LFG tool, so you might wait to join #sanctuary and ask in there.   If you're using the champion deck, make sure you have 1 tank and 1 healing talisman and devote the rest to dps. (If you're still using green talismans, you should be alright with just 1 healing talisman and skip the tank talisman since all green gear gives some hp).  Most of the decks in the game are pretty bad, as they don't account for using passives from weapons you don't have equipped. TSWDB.com has builds that actually make sense including some cheap starter builds."
TheSecretWorld,3e362w,jupitersky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:09 2015 UTC,So what makes a dedicated healing build for first time Polaris - assuming QL2 level gear? I have that Nuture which is a decent self-heal - if I'm not taking damage - could I make the tank my defensive target and have them take my Nuture heals to help out?
TheSecretWorld,3e362w,jupitersky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"For polaris, a dedicated healer would mean someone in nearly full heal rating trinkets with atleast 1 builder and 1 consumer that heals.  As for helping healing the tank, you're probably better off replacing nuture with a fist consumer that heals (like surgical steel). This way, you can build with blade torrent and consume with your heal and your dps skill. This also applies to when your solo'ing. Just keep in mind that if you don't have enough heal rating, you won't be healing for much."
TheSecretWorld,3e362w,serioussham,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"Most of the decks in the game are pretty bad, as they don't account for using passives from weapons you don't have equipped   Minor detail, but this is no longer the case. They updated the starter decks with the EPE, and they now include passives from all over the wheel."
TheSecretWorld,3e362w,Spenc_Ghost,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:42:16 2015 UTC,"I've found that hammer, blade, and chaos magic are the best trees to go down for tank builds (they have a lot of self-heal and threat pulling skills, especially multiple point-blank AoE abilities) Assault rifles, fist, and blood magic are the healing trees. Assault rifles focus on health leeching, fist are heals over time, and blood does damage absorbing shields along with all of the direct healing abilities in all three. On top of that tank builds only need concern themselves with blocking and max health stats on their gear and glyphs, while healers focus on critical chance and critical rating. Pretty much everything else in the game is for dps."
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,betweenTheMountains,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"Not just weapon's quality, also your equipments quality determines your quest difficulty. And yes, you should upgrade your gear. If you play enough, you'll be able to earn enough SP to open everything. And end game quest gives much more exp so it's better to get better gear and move on as soon as possible. But of course don't skip the story."
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,flamingmushroom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Let me just clarifty.. is it GEAR quality level that determines marked quest difficulty? Or SKILL level?
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,flamingmushroom,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:44 2015 UTC,gear quality
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,wahoozerman,3,Tue Jul 21 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"It is not, it is skill level.   You can check this by equipping QL1 gear and looking at a mission in Transylvania, it will still be marked the same difficulty."
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,flamingmushroom,0,Tue Jul 21 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"well, your skill level is determined with your quality of your gear."
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,wahoozerman,4,Tue Jul 21 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"Nope, your skill level is determined by how many skill points you've put into your skills. The gear you are actually wearing has no effect on your skill level.  From the Skill Rank tooltip:   Skill Rank is determined by a combination of your major, minor, and head talisman skills, along with your highest level weapon skill. It represents your character's potential power.   You may be thinking of Effusion rating, which is actually calculated based on the gear your currently have equipped. However, it isn't used to determine the difficulty of missions."
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,DrunkColdStone,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"The difficulty estimate of missions is based on a combination of the three talisman skill ranks and your top weapon skill ranks (I thought it was best two ranks but wahoozerman said highest single track and he might be right). If you are still picking weapons, you are safe putting the points in the talisman tracks as those you will definitely be using all along.   Also worth noting that missions further into the game give more experience than ones earlier in the game. This means that while a Very Hard mission might have its experience reward reduced by 15%, it will still likely give you just as much or more xp as completing one rated Normal.   Still, the idea of the game is to do missions labelled as Normal and Easy and that is quite easily achievable. You should start maxing out your talisman and favorite weapon tracks by the end of Solomon Island or early Egypt at which point every mission that isn't in a lair or a Nightmare zone will be labeled at most Normal. For the remainder of the game you can invest your SP in the alternative weapon tracks of your favored weapons, other weapon skills, auxiliary weapon skills and so on.  The system is there mostly in order to prevent experienced players from power leveling a new toon by completing end zone sabotage and investigation missions (each giving 1-1.5 million xp when at Normal difficulty) from the beginning (easily doable since they don't generally require fighting just knowing the world and being sneaky)."
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,Pointyteef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:49 2015 UTC,awesome. this is the most complete answer yet. thank you!
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,wahoozerman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:44:19 2015 UTC,Well I didn't know this; very interesting. Most quests I have seen/been presented initially were labeled as hard/very hard. I've now subsequently started to upgrade my gear/skills and noticed the Normal listings. I'm used to other MMOs giving more xp if you can stretch yourself - this definitely sounds opposite to that. It sounds like Skill Level is the main determinant - true statement?
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,wahoozerman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, skill level is the main determinant. It's some combination of your head, major, and minor talisman skills, plus whatever your highest weapon track skill is.  It's important to note that only the highest weapon skill track counts. So having 4 and 4 in Healing and Damage for assault rifles does not count as 8, it only still counts as 4!"
TheSecretWorld,3e3bxm,DrunkColdStone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"This is good information, thanks for the reply! Just one more thing to clarify on, is the guide correct in stating the you get more experience the easier marking the quest has? With normal and easier giving the most experience?"
TheSecretWorld,3e1puc,EsotericCheetah,3,Tue Jul 21 07:40:18 2015 UTC,"You will still get the survivability weapon skill passives from both weapons you have equipped. With your Chaos/Hammer deck, if you evade an attack while holding your hammer focus you will receive Fleeting Fortress. If you block an attack while holding your chaos focus you still be awarded a bonus damage reduction."
TheSecretWorld,3e1puc,Geekn4sty,3,Tue Jul 21 08:42:11 2015 UTC,Equipped means you have the weapon in the box on the character sheet.  Active means you have the weapon out and currently using it or it was the last used weapon.  The skill passives (when you hit K and hover over the trees you can level) are added when the weapon is equipped.  Glyphs and signets on the weapon are only added when the weapon is active.  So if you have a +block glyph (stat points) on your hammer that additional block chance is only when you have the weapon out.
TheSecretWorld,3e1puc,belladawnaTSW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:45 2015 UTC,"In the game, there are 2 slots for your weapon. If necessary weapon is in one of them, it counts as equipped. You don't have to actually hold the said weapon. Hell, you can even uncheck the boxes under them and enter the fight without a weapon. For a few seconds.  But, if you'd ask me, i'd tell you to use the active skills from the other weapon too. At least the ones with a cooldown, so you can attack more and stronger."
TheSecretWorld,3e1puc,kilgenmus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:09:49 2015 UTC,"Everything about your post is wrong.   You only get the stats of currently attacking/last attacked with weapon for stats (this is your active weapon). If I have crit on my builder and crit power on my consumer I only get the stat from the builder while building, and crit power when I use my consumer weapon. You do NOT get both.  Unchecking the boxes under the weapons does absolutely nothing to the math of attacks nor does it mean you have no weapon to attack with, it simply changes the way you LOOK by not hanging a bugged double shotgun or buggy pistol with two damn barrels or something while you run around."
TheSecretWorld,3e1puc,wag3slav3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"What do you mean you do not get both? I equip both of my weapons, and i only get the stats of the last used weapon? I don't think it works like that. Active weapon is only effective for skills afaik. It doesn't matter if you don't use your secondary weapon, you get the passive skills.  And, that's exactly what i've tried to say. It doesn't do anything other than cosmetic. Sorry for confusion."
TheSecretWorld,3e16w4,NeuroticWolf,6,Tue Jul 21 04:09:46 2015 UTC,If you haven't killed Beaumont yet then you have a huge amount of story mission to complete.  The basic strategy to kill him is to kill the adds he summons (the clones and the dogs) until 25% then dps him down quick to finish him off.  Do you have any of the additional DLC (issue 5 onwards?)
TheSecretWorld,3e16w4,LilianH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:35 2015 UTC,No I was hoping to kill Beaumont before purchasing further issues.  I've tried that strat after researching and I still seem to die pretty quickly regardless. :(
TheSecretWorld,3e16w4,LilianH,3,Tue Jul 21 04:42:42 2015 UTC,Might need to look at your build and gear then. If you've done all the missions then I assume you have QL10 greens at least?
TheSecretWorld,3e16w4,LilianH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:50:59 2015 UTC,I have QL 3-8 rares and a QL 10 uncommon Aux.
TheSecretWorld,3e16w4,ragedyrage,4,Tue Jul 21 05:04:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well if you have the skill for QL10 gear try checking on the trading post for some cheap QL10 blue gear. It's often going fairly cheaply."

TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,AeternusNihil,4,Mon Jul 20 12:05:28 2015 UTC,"Your questions seems to have been answered but I do have a few things to add:   This sounds like you skipped most of the content on Solomon Island. If you do each mission in a zone once before moving on, all non-NM content will stay on Normal difficulty throughout the game. NM and lair content is always listed as devastating for everyone and there are NM and lair zones as early as Kingsmouth town but they require QL 10 gear and possibly groups to handle. If you are able to equip QL6 gear in all talisman slots and two kinds of weapons, early Scorched Desert should be Normal or at most Hard difficulty. Egypt drops Ql 7-9 gear so it being Devastating means you wouldn't to be able to equip any of the gear it drops. Don't feel shy about asking what acronyms mean in #Sanctuary. People will be happy to explain. The only times I've encountered this issue was when I used leech abilities and didn't have los on my defensive target. Are you using AR abilities at all?"
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,DrunkColdStone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:14 2015 UTC,"See to me, I feel I didn't skip a LOT of quests... I made sure to wait for the story quests to be ""Normal"" instead of even ""Hard/Very Hard"" before doing them.  The last few Tiers of Endless Night I was they were ""Hard"", but then the immediate push to Devastating in Egypt threw me off.  It's just the progression that's throwing me a bit, really.  But it seems I'm resigned to just grind it out. Yeah, I generally don't bother chat unless it's info I can find elsewhere and this happened to be a morning thought away from the game. It's a really odd scenario.  I'll be in a room, specifically this happened in the Franklin Mansion in BM-- I was fighting the Housekeeper on Tier 3 or 4 of a quest.  I'm standing right in front of them, about 4-5 feet back.  With all direct-target abilities it will give me ""No LoS"".  I'll run away from them, LoS THEM into another room, and still can't attack.  I'll run around them in circles, making sure to always face them, and I can't attack with anything.  AoE abilities damage them, but no direct attacks.  It's a really odd scenario which I can't do anything about but die."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,meatwhisper,4,Mon Jul 20 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"For me, part of the joy of the game is scrubbing every map for each quest and make sure I've done EVERYTHING before going on.  I've managed to get every ounce of AP from doing this, and honestly I'm well overgeared for where I am now (just finished COSG main quest and am cleaning up the missions now).  There are some areas you can't do, or should wait to do... but I'm in 10+QL gear now and have more than enough abilities to play around with, it's a nice feeling.  I can worry about tweaking deck builds rather than making sure I'm geared up to the enemies.  It's important to note that while I'm overgeared for where I am, the game is still challenging and has plenty of scary enough fights to keep me happy."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,wahoozerman,2,Mon Jul 20 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't need to repeat quests in order to progress at all, even if you're doing missions labeled Hard. I'm betting you missed a few mission givers. Check your map, it should show you where all the NPCs and side missions are. I've been going through the game on a new character, not using any boosts or anything, and I was up to the level of Scorched Desert about halfway through Savage Coast.  One thing that might be happening here is that you might be distributing your skill points poorly. The difficulty of the missions is determined by your skill level in the various skills. If you've neglected one of your talisman skills, or your weapon skills, then the game may think you are lower powered than you should be for your XP level.  You should be spreading your skill points out among talisman skills and weapon skills. For weapon skills make sure you are only putting points on one of the tracks, it only determines your power level from whichever track is highest, as this is the track that determines how high level a weapon you can equip."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,RoflCrisp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:14 2015 UTC,"One thing that might be happening here is that you might be distributing your skill points poorly. The difficulty of the missions is determined by your skill level in the various skills.   This is why I said in my main part that I messed up w/ SP early on, and right now have 11 ""useless"" SP spent that I cannot refund, respend or otherwise reuse-- so I'm basically stuck regrinding out those SP to use on weapons I AM using-- I think that's the main thing that messed me up-- otherwise I'd be around QL5-6 right now instead of QL4-5.   For weapon skills make sure you are only putting points on one of the tracks   Seriously?  So the fact that I'm 3 tiers deep into AR healing and 5 tiers deep into AR damage means that I shouldn't have even wasted the 6 points in the healing?  That's... kind of disappointing-- I was trying to keep them around the same levels for soloing."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,DrunkColdStone,2,Mon Jul 20 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"He may be onto something here. If you're using AR Leech abilities and you've selected a Defensive Target other than yourself you can get LoS to defensive target messages. Try hitting F1 the next time this issue occurs, this is the default hotkey to target yourself."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,RoflCrisp,2,Mon Jul 20 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"The early area of Scorched Desert shouldn't be that much more difficult than the end of Blue Mountain. You must have hit Very Hard mission somewhere. Anyway, 11 SP in the ""wrong"" tree is a minor thing. Doing every mission on Solomon Island exactly once allows you to get hundreds of SP so unless you are trying to level all weapons at the same time (just pick one track in each of two weapons to max out at first), you should have an easy enough time keeping up with SP. I had a skill of 10 in all three talisman groups and two weapons by early Egypt. So I gather from your other comment that you do use assault rifle healing abilities (anima shot?) in your build. It sounds like you selected an NPC in a different room and you didn't have LoS on your defensive target so you couldn't activate the single target leech ability."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,RoflCrisp,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"You've progressed your main story past what your gear ""should"" be when entering Egypt. Likely this happened by not doing enough of the other content scattered all around Soloman Island. You can get QL 5 Blue gear from Hell Raised, the dungeon in SC. BM has the dungeon Darkness War which drops QL 6 Blue gear. There are also Council of Venice vendors in every zone that will trade Blue gear with QL relative to the zone by using the currency Sequins of Soloman Island. There will be a massive currency overhaul whenever issue 12 is released so i won't go too much into the different region currencies. I'd say you wanna be in full-mostly full QL 6 Blue Talismans and Weapons before you head to Egypt. Of course the Auction House is an option to pick up gear too, located in London at the Post Offices.  Before I get into dungeon info, let me explain Rising Vigour as I see your current elite on chronicle sets a Hindered state. Whenever a boss in a dungeon gets Hindered or Impaired it gains a stack of Rising Vigour that lasts 15s. At 3 stacks of RV the boss becomes CC immune. This is important because as a DPS you never want to Hinder or Impair, as the tank will need to impair important abilities.   Okay so to properly explain your question about LFG I'll explain the basic dungeon progression. Each zone has a dungeon, a total of 8 different dungeons for the base game. There are 3 different difficulties for the dungeons: Normal Mode, Elite Mode, and Nightmare mode. It's important to note that the Transylvania dungeons don't have a Normal Mode version. The LFG tool (Shift+C) breaks down dungeons sign ups by difficulty too.   For the Normal Mode dungeons we have:  Polaris (Pol) in Kingsmouth that drops QL 3 Blues  Hell Raised (HR) in Savage Coast that drops QL 5 Blues  Darkness War (DW) in Blue Mountain that drops QL 6 Blues  Ankh in Scorched Desert that drops QL 8 Blues iirc  Hell Fallen (HF) in City of the Sun God that drops QL 9 Blues iirc  Elite Mode dungeons all drop QL 10 Blues. In addition to the 5 dungeons above there is Facility (Fac), Hell Eternal (HE), and Slaughterhouse (SH). I recommend starting Elites once you can wear QL 10 gear. To unlock Nightmare Mode (NM or NMs for plural) you must beat each Elite dungeon at least once to first unlock the Gatekeeper (GK). Defeat GK to unlock NMs, where QL 10+ purple gear drops, you can learn more about end game gearing once you're closer to it.   Now for a few of the other things. It's good to know that each dungeon consists of 6 bosses. You asked about 18s, well this is the first 3 dungeons (Pol, HR, DW) on NM. 24s is 18s+HE.   As for how to advertise yourself currently you are looking to do Normal Mode dungeons. HR and DW are where you'll want to start for now as they drop the gear lvls you're wanting to pick up currently. For normal modes the best place to look is either #Sanctuary, the LFG tool, or LFG chat in agartha or the zone of the dungeon you're looking to do (so SC for HR). You can even start your own teams by checking the LFG tool to see who's currently looking to group up, and form them up filling in the roles as needed (1 tank, 1 heal, 3 dps). There is a serious lack of players who take the initiative to form up normals, it's strange. Looking in Agartha and #Sanctuary it is also likely for you to find a highly geared player willing to help out, making the runs quite smooth.    No idea, never heard of this issue. Sorry :/   Hopefully that gets you going on some dungeons :) just go give um a shot. If you ever want a hand you can add me, my ign is in my flair."

But I'm now in a limbo of having to go back and redo quests to get my QL up to par to move on, which really breaks the amazing atmosphere for me.  I might tackle some dungeons since I haven't done those yet. That Dungeon info was pretty damn useful-- and yeah my elite, and for that matter, my whole setup, is geared for soloing and self-sufficiency, so I'd be redoing pretty much everything for the dungeons.  I'll say from just that I have a bit more confidence at least deciphering and starting groups."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,ISeeAFool,3,Mon Jul 20 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"You get a lot more exp for your first completion of a dungeon, and heck if you want I'll hop in and take your thru Pol, HR, and DW now if you have time. It'd take about an hour or so. If you can't then just know you'll wanna do um all once.  It's true that you will want to have separate builds for dungeons and solo play. However don't sweat that too much for now, as really until you hit NM it's not as important to have the perfect build for dungeons."

Make sure that you're leveling up your weapon/talisman skills - this will have a big effect on the difficulty displayed on a quest.  Note: you only need to level up on side of a weapon (e.g. Damage or Survival for Blades, Damage or Support for Elemental)."

TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,DrunkColdStone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:43 2015 UTC,"I don't really have all the answers to your questions, but honestly you could likely do the missions in Egypt with only moderate difficulty if you didn't have a problem finishing off Solomon Island. Even with the hit to XP you'd catch up pretty easily. Repeating through the investigation missions in Solomon will help since they give tend to give a ton of XP, if you aren't cool with the XP reduction for doing devastating missions.  As far as the 18s thing, I don't know a lot of the LFG lingo but I do know that someone asking for 18s usually means they intend to run the first/easiest three nightmare dungeons (Polaris, Hell Raised, Darkness War) with a single group."
TheSecretWorld,3dxqjz,RustyRain,2,Mon Jul 20 12:57:13 2015 UTC,Investigation missions give much less xp on repeat. The reduction is something along the lines of 80%.

Also, something I've noticed so far that has really impressed me in the game, there seem to be some gay NPCs, and it's subtle/realistic and it's well done. Some other games, in the very rare instance that they do have gay characters, they have to go on and on about how they are gay and remind you that they are gay every few minutes, constantly forcing it into dialog and creating the worst story lines (I'm looking at you Marjory and Kasmeer).      I'm all for diversity in games, even more so when it's done well.  So far from what I've seen in SW, it's done very well.  I hope this holds true as I continue to work through the story.  :)"

TheSecretWorld,3duosm,flamingmushroom,3,Sun Jul 19 19:11:19 2015 UTC,I thought those two characters were a nod to James Randi and Jose. Although they weren't out to any but family and very close friends until 2010.

He couldn't stand seeing stage magic perverted to bilk people out of their money so he went after all the charlatans like Uri Geller and that disgusting Popov televangelist. Gay or straight, he's the kind of man who's lived a life worth imitating. If you watch the new movie about him there is a section where he ponders the possible future alone where Jose gets deported and murdered which moves even a stone hearted man to tears. He stayed in the closet not because he was ashamed, but because it would have made it more difficult to save people from those that would deceive. I hope that someone continues his philosophical legacy, even though his biological legacy will not."

TheSecretWorld,3duosm,VexedForest,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:40 2015 UTC,TSW has a great community. One time very recently I was in Fusang and I asked for people not to kill me while I try to re-create a glitch that had happened to me earlier that day. Everyone listened. Someone started to attack me and another player stopped them and told them what I was trying to do. I was around a lot of enemy players who did not kill me so I could try to re-create a glitch. I don't think I could do that in any other MMO.
TheSecretWorld,3dtj8b,rifeid,2,Sun Jul 19 08:48:15 2015 UTC,"Background: Illuminati and Templars cutscenes at the end of Issue 11 (after the events at Orochi Tower) show that their faction leaders are angry that the Dragon ""got the upper hand"" in Tokyo, but there is absolutely no context as to what exactly this refers to. The Dragon cutscene also doesn't explain what they managed to accomplish that the other factions didn't.  TLDR: The ""upper hand"" refers to Daimon Kiyota joining the Dragon. Meanwhile, Inbeda and Gozen continued their bickering with each other in Kaidan."
TheSecretWorld,3dtj8b,wahoozerman,3,Sun Jul 19 08:49:17 2015 UTC,"For me, the easiest way to see that the Dragon got the upper hand in Kaidan is to look at the end of Issue 11. It's not said in any cutscene, but it's a pretty clear question. Who is in charge of Orochi Tower?  It's pretty clear that Daimon has stepped up and taken charge of operations in the Tower, and it's pretty clear that any advantage he gets from that is going to the Dragon.  Just think of all the research and technology contained in the tower. The Dragon control all of that now. The Orochi, one of the most powerful corporations in the world, one which we have been repeatedly told have been effectively keeping secrets and resources even from the big three, are now an open book to the Dragon."
TheSecretWorld,3dtj8b,Tapkoh,2,Sun Jul 19 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"I doubt the higher ups in the Illuminati and Templars have any idea what Daimon was actually up to. I would be surprised if the Dragon know everything, to be honest. From their perspective, your handler sent you to Tokyo, backed a local faction, and then assaulted a very powerful organization (Orochi). To make matters worse, the faction you backed bowed, however temporarily, to the faction backed by the Dragon, who seemed to do better in the chaos of Kaidan than your own Kaidan-based allies, and now he's suddenly at the top of the Dragon hierarchy. How did he get there? He must have had something to trade for such a position no? That's their reasoning anyway.  In their eyes, your handler done goofed. You backed the wrong horse, pissed off Orochi, and it seems like the Dragon is the only group with anything to show for it. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. We'll see. In the meantime, it looks like the Dragon have the upper hand, compared to the other cabals, and the blues and reds are unhappy that they're not in that position."
TheSecretWorld,3dtj8b,LilianH,3,Mon Jul 20 06:56:55 2015 UTC,"The current theory is that the Dragon stole something very valuable from the Faust Capital vault. This is explored when you journey through Tokyo, the heist mission earlier on was to test security and learn where this item was, Daimon then gets the factions to work together so his team can get into the vault in the tower and finally we arrive to discover the looted vault after the dragon have made their getaway."
TheSecretWorld,3dtj8b,Skrp,2,Sun Jul 19 09:02:06 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it might be Akhenaten's staff.

Ofcourse there are exceptions as with everything and if  I were to suggest 2 cabals of which I personally know of that are accepting and very friendly it'd be Nine-swords (templar) and League of monster slayers (all factions).

I can suggest that the Arcadia server at the very least (my home server) is pretty damn accepting and trans friendly if you're still considering.    There are a handful of us who are open about it and the few negative reactions are far outweighed by the positive support.     I can't say I can give any cabal suggestions though as I've only been a part of three in my time playing. Your best bet will be to roll a Templar or look for a multi-faction cabal.  Atleast on Arcadia, dragon/lumie cabals seem to be far and few between.  I'd estimate under 20 between the two factions that are 'stand alone' and not part of any multifaction cabal.  It's quite...sad really."

TheSecretWorld,3djc2n,bauhau8,9,Thu Jul 16 19:03:18 2015 UTC,"Here here!  It looks... amateurish.  The yellow and dark grey are a big problem, but the banner is probably the biggest offender.  It isn't really clear what's going on, much less what it has to do with TSW, and most annoyingly, there's no border around the ""THE SECRET WORLD"" but it uses a battle-damaged font and a color with a similar darkness level to parts of the background, so it blends unevenly into the tableau.  That logo works well on the TSW home page because it's on a black background; stick it over an image that vacillates between bright and dark and you just end up muddled.  I'm glad the subreddit exists, but I wouldn't be unhappy to see a revamp.  Maybe to something cleaner."
TheSecretWorld,3djc2n,BlaineTog,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"You need to pay more attention to the game :D The banner is a band from the London Night Market loading screen which is awesome and it is really easy to tell that is exactly what it is. It also has a pretty cool dark and gritty cyberpunk feeling which fits the game quite well, imo."
TheSecretWorld,3djc2n,DrunkColdStone,2,Fri Jul 17 06:29:20 2015 UTC,"My contention isn't that the scene isn't from TSW, as I'm very sure it is.  My contention is that it isn't sufficiently evocative."
TheSecretWorld,3djc2n,BlaineTog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:16:09 2015 UTC,I find that the full image is great at evoking and displaying all the best things about the TSW world but I saw it long before I saw the subreddit banner so I always associated the two. It's entirely possible that the banner on its own is too small to tell what it is displaying but I always found it a good middle ground between having an image on top and not covering a big part of the screen with an image that never contains useful information.
TheSecretWorld,3djc2n,DrunkColdStone,2,Fri Jul 17 12:37:47 2015 UTC,"Most of the loading screens in the game are great, and the decision to colorize them as the world loads was very clever as well.  However, the strip of it we see here doesn't give enough information on its own to say anything.  It's just an incoherent jumble of pieces of things without enough of any of them to give you an idea of the whole, unless you're looking for it and already know exactly what you're looking for.  I can't imagine it means anything at all to new players.  More importantly, it really doesn't play nice with the logo -- you need a black border around any words set against a background with varying light values and colors or they'll just blend in in a very choppy, unpleasant way.  That's Graphic Design 101, and it's why all those memes you see out there on the internet use the font they do regardless of background image."
TheSecretWorld,3djc2n,BlaineTog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:20:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, the logo also looks fine to me but it's just a personal opinion and judging by the responses in this thread, not a very popular one. It has enough contrast to be easy to read unlike clicked links that tend to become almost invisible or almost indistinguishable from normal text (I can't even figure out why they behave differently at different times)."
TheSecretWorld,3djc2n,DrunkColdStone,6,Fri Jul 17 13:39:15 2015 UTC,"My main complaints are that I can't read the dark purple visited links at all (it looks like purple smudges against this dark grey), and some features are invisible for some reason (video/image dropdowns in RES [not always??], number of points on a post).  I don't mind the look overall, but sometime's it's a pain to read.  Also, the common reddit spoiler tag doesn't work right.  If it did, this would be blacked out, not highlighted.  The alternative is HOVER FOR SPOILER TEXT.  Edit to add-- I don't have a problem with the light grey text on dark grey background.  It fits the style while having enough contrast to read (and low enough that it's not painful, like white text on black background is for me).  It would just be nice to clean up those few things that actually do make the sub hard to read."

TheSecretWorld,3dijgp,meatwhisper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:50:51 2015 UTC,build=deck(powers)+gear  most builds in my link have explanations and recommended stats  you not providing enough details to give more detailed answer (role / your ql / what you expect build to do etc)
TheSecretWorld,3dijgp,DrunkColdStone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I have almost a full range of 10QL gear I've gotten from PVP.  However I'm still working on missions from COSG and taking my time.    I know I'm getting to a place where having decks that work with different types of gear is optimal, esp since now I know how easy it is to get good stuff from playing PVP.  However since vast majority of my play will be mission grinding solo (and I haven't hit Trans or Tokyo yet) I just want to have a good idea of the direction I need to go.  Heal gear on head?  DPS gear on Major?"
TheSecretWorld,3dijgp,Chasym,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:43 2015 UTC,example of build - http://www.tswdb.com/builds/solo/tokyo-drift/  it contains stats - it doesn't matter from which talismans they come (important that not from weapons thou)  if you want now to calculate diferent options i think this can be of use: http://joakibj.com/tswcalc/#
TheSecretWorld,3dijgp,Chasym,2,Thu Jul 16 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks.  I think that was my biggest confusion.  Seems like there are so many options of gear, that I didn't want to equip a bunch of stuff that didn't work.  But heck, I've beat the story boss of COSG with under 2K health so it can't be all that bad."
TheSecretWorld,3dijgp,Chasym,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"That's why I took the health headpiece, as it gives a considerable boost to your survivability."
TheSecretWorld,3dijgp,DrunkColdStone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"This depends a bit on your gear level. For example, with full endgame gear a single health minor and heal minor are more than enough for soloing almost everything in the game (including many things that aren't supposed to be soloable). I'd say if you have blues of the QL that the local dungeon drops (so QL 9 for CotSG), you can get away with one health major and the rest in dps gear. If you have a lot of healing in your build, you can also put on a heal piece but it shouldn't be required for the most part as you'll kill things before you run out of hp. Then just stuff your face with a taco or other snack of your choice and you are ready to take on the next challenge in ~3 seconds."
TheSecretWorld,3dijgp,DrunkColdStone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:38:07 2015 UTC,"Well here's what I running for general solo grinding right now.  I'm sort of ""all-in"" with DPS gear I picked up from PVP.  I know that's not ideal (for solo fun) and as I get more gear through the coming weeks/months I really just wanted to know if there was something I was missing as far as ""Heal works best with Head"" etc....  http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com/character/appletango"
TheSecretWorld,3dg4ya,Dakkaface,5,Thu Jul 16 00:27:37 2015 UTC,"That build you're currently using, in general, looks pretty solid. As far as builds that take like 850 AP to unlock, without looking I fully assume it's because of the passives. You use your 2 weapons to determine your actives, but passives can come from any weapon tree. This ends up meaning that most ""top tier"" builds will pull the best passives from all over the place. AR/Shotty doesn't have as much synergy as other combinations when ends up meaning it has to reach into a deeper passive pool to really flesh out the builds. All that being said AR/Shotty is perfectly viable for solo play, that really comes down to what you enjoy. It also works fairly well in dungeons too, it's just not that common because of the range difference on the weapons. I see more AR/Ele and Pistol/Shotgun than using AR/Shotty but that doesn't mean it's bad.   As far as feeling like the build could be faster, and progression further on, this mainly ties into your gear. Watch to see if you're glancing or being blocked a lot, and combat them with Hit Rating and Penetration Rating respectively. As far as build progression goes tswdb is the best source ik of online, but you've already browsed that. Just some small thoughts I'd have is I notice you're using an aoe builder and 2 single target consumers. This isn't inherently bad but if you wanna speed up kill times on groups of mobs you may wanna add more aoe and such. Passives are what will really make most any build come together, take some time looking at how the tswdb solo builds setup their passives and craft from there.   Once you're settled on your solo build look into what you need to unlock for dungeon setups. This is another place where the passives will make a massive difference. Be it something like Elemental Force being an amazing dps buff or Perjury for when you need to self cleanse (HR boss 6 Machine Tyrant requires cleanses, most groups take either perjury or all 3 dps take Clean Up). Things like that are good to look towards for unlocks depending how quickly you choose to progress through dungeon difficulties.   I don't really feel like I've given too great an answer here, but if you'd like to add me in game and talk a bit more in depth my ign is in my flair, just add me."
TheSecretWorld,3dg4ya,RoflCrisp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:49:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the general advice.  After playing around with the deck builder, being able to sort things by state and triggers, it's a little clearer as to why AR/Shotty isn't that popular - they don't share a lot of things to pump via passives.  A few build ideas are jumping out at me.  I'm already kind of focusing on penetration shenanigans, so it looks like Blade or Blood would combo well with it.   As far as feeling like the build could be faster, and progression further on, this mainly ties into your gear. Watch to see if you're glancing or being blocked a lot, and combat them with Hit Rating and Penetration Rating respectively.   I've kinda just been throwing on whatever gives me higher green numbers.  I guess I should pay more attention to the stats provided instead of settling for higher numbers.   I notice you're using an aoe builder and 2 single target consumers. This isn't inherently bad but if you wanna speed up kill times on groups of mobs you may wanna add more aoe and such.    Right now zombies aren't an issue - even 4 man mobs can be taken care of relatively quickly because of Hit and Run - build up resources on them all, hit the lead guy with the AR skills and he explodes, hit the second one again and he explodes too and then the other two usually die from chain explosions.  It's the draug & ak'aab that are giving me trouble.   EDIT: Tried dropping in a Blast consumer from shotgun - it really does shorten fight times with trash mobs considerably.  Right now, I'm trying a few different things with Blade, AR and Shotgun, building toward grabbing Blood abilities.  Decks are largely one AOE builder, one single target ranged builder, 1 each single target consumer and one AOE consumer, last two slots usually non-resource based skills.  I think right now I haven't got enough of the fancier passives to reliably trigger Blade heals, so it'll have to be AR or Blood."
TheSecretWorld,3dg4ya,BlaineTog,3,Thu Jul 16 07:29:26 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience with SG or AR, but I do know Blade pretty well and I would urge you to give it another try.  Here's a cheap (34 AP) Sword/Blood build that should work pretty well early.  You won't be the fastest killer in Kingsmouth but you should be pretty safe.  The builder is a point-blank (not-targeted) AoE, too, so you don't have to keep acquiring a target to set up, just mash your builder button in the general vicinity of a foe and watch your resources go up.  When the build really kicks into overdrive is when you unlock Gross Anatomy at the end of Blood's Transmission line.  Most of the actives and passives I suggested have much better analogues later on in the tree, but you'll notice an immediate spike in your damage as soon as you equip Gross Anatomy.  That said, I wish you luck in finding an SG/AR build."
TheSecretWorld,3dg4ya,RoflCrisp,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:05 2015 UTC,Wow for being 34 AP that's a super solid build. OP of you're interested in giving blade a try this would be a great place to start. i prefer Close Quarters blade builds over Gross Anatomy blade builds but that's just me :P
TheSecretWorld,3dg4ya,BlaineTog,2,Thu Jul 16 04:00:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that looks pretty nice and super survivable.  I haven't got any SP or AP in Blood right now though so this will probably be a little time to build so I can get a up to Blood skill 3-4.  Blade is only at one skill but I have most of the inner ring purchased already.   Have to invest some SP into Blades again.  Right now I'm seeing alot of Penetration triggers in Blade, so maybe a Penetration focused build like this?  EDIT: After looking into the Blood trees, I can definitely see that the synergy extends beyond basic penetration triggers.  Started buying Blood abilites for this and dropping SP into Blood."
TheSecretWorld,3dg4ya,DrunkColdStone,2,Thu Jul 16 07:55:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as you get access to outer-ring skills, you'll generally want to preference skills that trigger on Penetration, though since this build is heavily into Affliction as well you can (and should) also go for Affliction triggers.  Here's the Sword/Blood build I'm currently using.  It's almost exactly 10 times as expensive as the cheap build I showed you, but it also hits much harder with a lot of on-hit effects mixed in there.  For the elite active, sometimes I'll switch to Four Seasons if I know I'm only fighting one target and I don't think I'll need the interrupt (it absolutely destroys single-target foes with this build because of how many on-hit effects it procs).  Oh, and a few quick tweaks to the build I mentioned earlier for some advanced options:   You can go with Exsanguinate instead of Blood Spike if you don't like the casting animation of Blood Spike.  Exsanguinate is a channel and costs 5 resources, but it also begins immediately, which can feel smoother while still giving you tremendous single-target damage.  Ideally, try to time it so you use it right after stunning your target with Stunning Swirl (the extra Affliction is great, plus you get an extra Gross Anatomy proc) but you can pop it on its own if Stunning Swirl is on cooldown.  Just be careful not to dump your Blood resources if you're gonna need them to heal soon.  That's the one tricky thing with this build: deciding when to use Blood for healing and when to use it for extra damage. You can also swap out one of the Blade consumers for Blood Shield if you're having trouble with a particular area; I'm not ashamed to admit that I only made it through certain spots in the game by frantically pounding Blood Shield into Angelic Aegis while running from a giant horde of enemies, buying time for Martial Discipline to come back off cooldown (seriously, that skill is the bee's knees -- up until you hit Tokyo, it's basically a 6-second invulnerability button when combined with the Martial Regeneration passive). After getting Gross Anatomy, a good goal should be Bloodsport over in the Fist outer ring.  Once you get Bloodsport, you can drop Blade Torrent+Perfect Storm and pick up Forking Paths as your builder instead, which does everything Blade Torrent does for this build while also healing you.  You'll also pick up Salt in the Wound on the way, which is basically an extra 50% of Bloodsport's damage."
TheSecretWorld,3dg4ya,aircoft,3,Thu Jul 16 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"RoflCrisp already covered most of what you asked so I'd just like to add a few minor comments about the build because you say you wish it was faster and while you have a really solid core, there is some room to increase the amount of damage you do:   You should be running at least 70% attack rating talismans with the rest split between health and heal rating. If you are using green talismans instead of blues, you should be running almost all attack pieces with maybe a minor health piece. The two stats that are always good for hit and penetration so have as many hit and penetration glyphs as you can conveniently manage. Having a few pieces of different glyphed gear is not a huge issue but 0 hit and 0 pen will make it very hard to kill anything. Lick your wounds is good for proc'ing things (no need to worry about that for a while) but the heal is rather inconsequential unless you have a lot of heal rating and you shouldn't have much of that. Maybe replace it with something for more damage? Depending on how much healing you need, you can replace shot of anima and/or anima shot for extra damage abilities (lock & load for example). Out For a Kill (OFaK) -> Three round burst (3rb) -> L&L -> 3rb is a pretty powerful combo that should kill just about any open world mob and will hopefully make your fights go a lot quicker. 12 gouge is great on dungeon bosses and other big enemies but open world enemies die too quickly to make it worth it. You need at minimum 2 hits per stack (likely a lot more with less than endgame gear) so you will kill things before you stack it up. If you want to apply a weaken, look into Improved Blasts or Bad Break. Nothing else in your build makes use of weakens though so you might as well replace 12 gouge with whatever else. Hothead and Rapid Getaway both give you the same effect (minor crit chance) which does not stack. You should only keep one and while Rapid Getaway is by far the stronger of the two, passive elites are quite powerful so you have a lot of interesting choices there. Melee weapons start the fight with maxed out resources. Magic weapons allow you to build up resources on one enemy and consume it on the next one. Ranged weapons require to you start each with from scratch so you are kind of stuck doing builders at the beginning. There are some ways around that (lock & load; lock, stock & barrel; gun fu) so you should consider them if you want to speed up fights.   tl;dr You have a solid build. If you want to kill things faster, just start dropping healing and survival gear and abilities until you start having trouble staying alive. Generally, the harder you hit, the less survival things you need as enemies have little chance to hit back."

Each key opens a dedicated container, to reveal a boss you have to kill for loot. Green/Blue bosses (and perhaps also white) can drop epic curiousities. The Agitation Configuration (increased hate gain), The Torment Configuration (increased dmg) and a leech one (which is quite mediocre). The best one IMO is The Agitation Config.

TheSecretWorld,3dds45,PM_ME_YOUR_HEELS,3,Wed Jul 15 14:07:30 2015 UTC,Somewhat my evade-tank stat breakdown  Blade/Chaos Build  Does well in picking relics in El Dorado too when you pop illusion+smoke&mirrors+evade gadgets. You can slot more attack rating with block glyphs if you want to do more reflect damage. The arterial pulse passive can be replaced by anything.
TheSecretWorld,3dds45,JCorkill,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:02:02 2015 UTC,My Chaos/blade Build  Thanks for your answer. So my first thought to put 1000 evade seems too much :)
TheSecretWorld,3dds45,Renard4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:02:10 2015 UTC,"What you need is some offtank gear, ie lots of HPs but pen/crit and some hit on glyph slots. Try to keep around 2k attack rating though. With block and evade you will get very little dps, which is fine to pick up relics but not to kill others fast. The people you may think as ""tanks with dps"" are merely that: dps with a large hitpoint buffer.  Sadly there are few good resources out there because people keep their own build secret (even on chronicles!) so you'll have to experiment a lot to find something that works for you. I can assure you that tswd builds are mostly garbage."

As long as you make judicious use of Martial Stance and are careful with your Blood management (Blood Shot hits like a truck so you want to use it frequently, but The Scarlet Arts is an extraordinarily strong heal that will keep you alive through a lot -- and you can use Angelic Aegis instead when you're first starting out)."

If you're having trouble surviving (lower gear than mine, or elite group scenarios with too few people and you end up tanking... cough cough...), replacing the elite passive with Experience can make a huge difference.

As far as gear, I'd say you should have about 70% damage and 30% healing, but you might prefer to go 50% damage and 50% healing. I personally stay at 1970 HP (the lowest you can possible go), however, it might benefit you to go 3k-4k, but that's up to you. (Sometimes I'll throw on one HP piece of gear that gives me like 2k more HP for a fight that can easily hit over 1970 HP, but that's not that common.)

""no PVP at all."" could be ""[Thanks for the links! but ] I don't want to pvp at all, are there more builds besides those in the first link, or is that all of them?"" that thanks is maybe optional, but surely appreciated by people taking time out of their day to try and help you out."
TheSecretWorld,3d407l,Temil,2,Mon Jul 13 15:48:34 2015 UTC,What do you want to use the build for? That weapons combination can be used to do anything in the game but the builds would be very different.

TheSecretWorld,3d0ud9,kericstiq,2,Mon Jul 13 00:08:15 2015 UTC,Got this game some days ago but yet to get into it. It seems like my type of game with focus on storytelling rather than leveling. But I wonder if enough people are still playing to make the MMO parts enjoyable.  Great review nonetheless.
TheSecretWorld,3d0ud9,J0nSnw,2,Mon Jul 13 09:54:01 2015 UTC,"Wonder no longer, there are more people than ever (Except maybe launch)!

One of the best MMOs, period."

TheSecretWorld,3d24ge,cmVkZGl0,4,Sun Jul 12 22:23:55 2015 UTC,Steam keys for this game are only available from Steam. The keys you get from TheSecretWorld.com come directly from Funcom the developer and primary publisher (EA is the co-publisher).   The client you download has no DRM since you have to log in to your account to play.

TheSecretWorld,3d12x8,Bldyknuckles,3,Sun Jul 12 17:18:42 2015 UTC,The only way to get pure materials is upgrading a stack of lesser materials.
TheSecretWorld,3d12x8,belladawnaTSW,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:40:32 2015 UTC,disassemble or auction or upgrade lesser quality mats
TheSecretWorld,3d12x8,Axiom2000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"Farm for QL9/10 gear, then either disassemble, or sell.  If you disassemble it, you will get the material lower than that required to make an item of that QL rating. For example, to make a QL10 tallisman, you require pure materials. If you disassemble that tallisman, you will get back sacred materials. As you start building up your sacreds, you can combine them to make pures (5 sacreds per pure).   If you can get cheap stacks in the auction house (I'm not sure, I haven't looked in a while) then there may be more value in selling the stuff you'd otherwise be disassembling, then use the gains to buy the cheap mats, and still turn over a profit."

TheSecretWorld,3cwjbr,belladawnaTSW,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:09:43 2015 UTC,1) I have no interested in a Dungeon Finder tool.  I've never played another MMO that had auto grouping in a tool.  I have it in my head it is a WoW thing that came after I stopped playing.  2) I have LOTS of playfield tokens that are doing nothing.  You get them from clearing dungeons.  There really isn't much to do with them.  3) This is a question I've been struggling with for a long time.  Dev's keep saying that the vast majority of players are not in NM content. It seems like everyone I interact with is brand new to the game and still playing the story mission or well geared in 10.4.4+.  Maybe it is the crowd I hang out with skews my view.  4) Stat gain for after 10.5 need to be very low.  The current 10.5 stat budget is too much for all content.  On the upside I'm excited to DPS/Leech/Tank NMs instead of having to only Leech/Tank NM's.
TheSecretWorld,3cwjbr,gauntz,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:37:51 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone would prefer more aux weapons over actual new dungeons when we've been without a proper dungeon update since launch. There's an elite version for the casual players.

Look of orochi weapons but also partly a matter of availability.   Ones you can get all. 3 blueprints for from running 18s or 24s are cheap because dozens or hundreds of people do those dungeons everyday.   Sovtech is more expensive because Fac and SH are less commonly run. I could be wrong but I believe that one of the orochi bueprints requires you to run Ankh too (famous for its brutal gearchecks, and the difficult-to-master mechanics of it's 2nd and 6th fights)."

I'll double-click the game, clientpatcher loads into the background, and then nothing - no launcher, nada.  Clientpatcher sits in the background on about 12% of CPU and 30 megs of RAM, but otherwise doesn't change. In desperation, I'd copied it over from another computer that DID run it (my old gaming system, knowing I'd have gigs of updates, but certain it was a good install), same thing. So now I've renamed that directory and tried a fresh install.  About 40megs is installed (ie the game, with nothing downloaded) and ...same thing.  Never pops up the launch window, nothing.  I even let it run overnight, in case it might be downloading or something in the background somehow - nothing, directories are still ~40 megs originally installed. Win7 64 btw.  One point to clarify: this SYSTEM did run it, but then several weeks ago a piece of work software really bollixed my system, and I re-installed win7 64 clean...so I can't honestly say it 'ran on this machine' precisely, as it didn't run on this install of the OS.

Set the secret world to high priority  Run the client instead of the patcher If running thru steam start the patcher from the install folder There is a dxweb.exe or something very similar that will fix some problems try running that.  Close EVERYTHING, Anti virus, VOIP services, absolutely everything. Then run the game.   It once ran eventually after starting it up, it sat there at 10 percent cpu for about an hour then FINALLY started up. So if its really unfixable. Maybe plan your game time an hour or two ahead.   anyways hope this helps but if nothing works then you might be in the same boat as me buddy."

TheSecretWorld,3chi3u,Axiom2000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"Right now Funcom has a special, where if you sign up, the person who gave you the trial key gets one month of 'subscription'. They get to use a XP boost ones a day day for a month. Along with a few points to buy stuff with the online store.   Usually, they just get a moderate amount of veteran points.   honestly it's not a huge deal. It's not going to motivate people to sell / push the game. but at least they give you some thing."

TheSecretWorld,3ce8a1,Jetsu1337,12,Tue Jul 7 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"This is a bit complicated to explain but eventually you do want all abilities on the ability wheel. The benefits of not only having sword abilities:   you can use active abilities from your two equipped weapons which means that you build up resources for both weapons with one builder and then get to do two consumers (one for blade and one for elementalism, for example). you can use passive abilities from any weapon in your build which means that the more advanced builds combine passive abilities from the whole wheel. Sometimes you won't have any passive abilities from your equipped weapons and I can't think of any advanced build that only has passives from two weapons. more expensive abilities are not necessarily better which means that many of the most commonly used and versatile abilities in the game are cheap inner wheel ones. If you want a particular outer wheel ability for your build because of synergy, by all means get it, but don't assume it's better than what you have because it takes 100+ AP to unlock.   That said, if you are happy only using blade for now, there is no reason not to so long as you are not struggling with the content. Eventually you'll pick up a second weapon and it doesn't have to be elementalism."
TheSecretWorld,3ce8a1,DrunkColdStone,2,Tue Jul 7 05:59:01 2015 UTC,"Later on in the game, progression sort of goes horizontal. What this means is that enemies will stop being just more powerful, and will instead start using buffs and various tactics that make them much tougher to deal with unless you react accordingly. This will often mean you need to change what abilities you are using, sometimes even changing to a different weapon entirely.  In addition to this, you can use passives from any weapon, regardless of what you currently have equipped. This means it's valuable to level up all weapons in order to unlock the good passive abilities in those trees. For example, most of my endgame builds use passives from at least five different weapon trees."
TheSecretWorld,3ce8a1,wahoozerman,2,Tue Jul 7 12:03:11 2015 UTC,"Aside from the very valid points that others have raised :  In dungeons, raids, and pvp one has to vary one's builds.   Not every foe will be the same.    For example, you may go through Kingsmouth exploiting affliction.    At another place, relying on that build may not be optimal.  Also, someone may need DABS, so you need pistols and shotgun.     Or you may need purges.    Or a situation may arise where you need armor fati"

When you are poorly geared, you most likely are not going to be choosing what dungeons to do based on what gear it drops. You will most likely be choosing based on what you can get a group for (I know, I have been there!). While completing the Wiki is a nice, very few players have any interest in looking up the drops."
TheSecretWorld,3cayhs,TSW_Gladium,4,Mon Jul 6 14:56:21 2015 UTC,"Completing the Wiki is a good idea because it gives new players a resource to plan their character builds, and it's in a familiar format. There are many people are interested in looking up the drops, and there are other good reasons to completing the wiki. Not only are the loot tables incomplete, but the dungeon pages are lacking pictures and clear instructions.  Having solid numbers in the wiki helps people plan their builds (there have been a couple of build posts on the subreddit recently) and knowing how to do dungeons ( 80% of the dungeon runs I had recently had 1st time players in them)."

TheSecretWorld,3ccfn1,Zerei,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:06:22 2015 UTC,"Just to add some more info about G2A, since I have some experience with them.  They have good and cheap game keys, however you need to be careful with which seller you choose. G2A will refund you purchases that don't work, or stop working, but it will take a long time. A chargeback with your bank might be easier actually.  G2A has sellers who buys keys from the cheapest regions and/or keys from sales, meaning they can offer you a key at sales price (or below) all year 'round. Make sure you choose a seller with lots of good reviews. I bought Alien: Isolation, and the seller did a chargeback, meaning my key was revoked by Steam, as Steam no longer had their money. This did not affect my account (had I bought the game through Steam and done a chargeback, my Steam would have been banned forever with no choice to repay debt), but game was removed from library. Got my refund after 1+ month of back and forth.  Whenever the payment for a The Secret World key is charged back, they simply remove the key from your account. It is not banned, but simply becomes inaccessible as you no longer own the game. You just grab a new key and add it (and of course handle the seller who charged back the key)."

TheSecretWorld,3c6q7m,allan416519,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:51:19 2015 UTC,"The primer linked above is a good if dated primer on pvp. My suggestion is to get in there and die a lot. Pay attention to how you died and think about what gear and tactics you could have used to win or at least make that guy have to work harder to kill you. Don't be afraid to use bitch tactics.  Do things like hitting them at range with afflict and explosive expert then duck out of sight and hinder them when they try to chase you down. Even if you lose the fight you have cost them time and made them move which could open up opportunities for your team. Don't be afraid to die. If your suicide charge past that death ball of bad guys makes them stop their advance for 60 seconds in order to deal with you that is 60 seconds you have bought for your team.  Be proactive, if you are alone and pass an enemy base stop for a second and take a couple pot shots at their turret. If you are lucky someone will spend the time to check it out and if you are real lucky they will stop checking them out giving your real attacks more time until a counter attack arrives. General rule is if you are running around for 5 minutes to find the action you are probably doing it wrong. If you are standing still for more than 15 seconds you are almost definitely doing it wrong."

QL10 blues are pretty cheap.  Issue 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 all give one 10.1 purple talisman each from the final mission. Do these for some quick upgrades.

A piece of custom 10.1 gear is available for all the other slots. (issue 6 = head, issue 7 = neck, issue 8 story = waist, issue 9-11 = finger, wrist, and occult slots).  Also you can't get purple weapons without doing dungeons. However, during Halloween there will be a special dungeon where you can get non-upgradable 10.1 weapons as drops. There is usually limited competition for those and while they can't be upgraded they can be useful to get a headstart into dungeons or for solo play."

TheSecretWorld,3c32iq,LilianH,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:26:49 2015 UTC,"Welcome back!  1.  As others have said tokyo (3 zones, 1 dunggeon) is the most significant addition to the game. It introduces a form of horizontal progression called the AEGIS system which basically requires you to cycle through 3 colour-coded categories of effect to match the type of your attack with the shields around an enemy. It's not very complicated once you get to know it but it definitely gives you something to progress at if you've been playing since launch and have 10.5 everything.  Also new is the New User Experience which is an attempt to improve the UI, streamline the difficulty curve, and improve the unuitiveness of learning the game to new players. You'll notice minor quest objects now appear on the minimap for example. I haven't made a new character sicne the change so I can't comment on its effectiveness as a tutorial system but whatt UI changes I have observed are generally positive.  2. As Axiom said; by gear.  3. When you're all in Q 8 or 9 blues from normal dungeons (or Q10 greens from leveling) AND your glyph slotting is about right.  4. If you're planning to do progression stuff, which you seem to be, a good group is essential. Join a guild. Join #sanctuary and #noobmares. Start friending people you team with who don't suck.  5.

TheSecretWorld,3c24w4,HorrorBecomesYou,5,Sat Jul 4 01:37:57 2015 UTC,"@ReferencesFallout Not completely true. Joining a cabal definitely has other benefits like building an ingame network of people, which can offer you reliable and very likely regular dungeon/raid/scenario/lair runs. It's been nearly 2 years since I was without a cabal, and I don't look back. Definitely prefer cabal over pugging, and it's also easier to organise roleplaying events and other activities."
TheSecretWorld,3c24w4,Vikestart,2,Sat Jul 4 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"True. When I wrote it I was thinking about mechanical benefits built into the game such as ""cabal bonuses"" or ""special logo clothing"" ""super secret base"" etc. that are featured in some other games.  I completely was not considering just the community aspect."
TheSecretWorld,3c24w4,ReferencesFallout,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"Even then, I would say that you could find a significant mechanical benefit in being part of a cabal via the cabal bank.  I almost never do any runs with cabal mates, but I do regularly contribute to and make use of our bank.    While going through Kaiden, for example, it was immensely helpful to have access to a huge supply of AEGIS modules and capacitors.  I was able to regularly deck out my character with a full set appropriate to my new AEGIS QL, while paying forward the help by putting any modules and capacitors below my level into the bank for whomever might want the same aid."

TheSecretWorld,3c24w4,RoflCrisp,2,Sat Jul 4 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely. And your mileage may vary, but I honestly feel it's easier to even be motivated to log into the game when in a cabal. :)"
TheSecretWorld,3c24w4,Vikestart,2,Sat Jul 4 16:44:28 2015 UTC,There is no real benefit other than having a group to chat with regularly.
TheSecretWorld,3c24w4,ReferencesFallout,2,Sat Jul 4 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think whether a cabal is useful to you depends on your character progression.  When I was a low-to-mid level player working through the main storyline, being in the cabal wasn't that important. I was happy to just play with a IRL friend and it was fine.   Once I started doing nightmare dungeons, scenarios and raids...that was when being in a cabal was essential. PUGs can be great, but I've had some horrible PUGs where people have told me to delete my character because I sucked - stuff that would not fly in a cabal. Plus when you are grouping with a regular group, things move a lot smoother because you develop a good understanding, which is especially important when you are doing the New York raid.   So the benefit of being in a cabal is to have better (and friendlier) access to high-end group content. Also to make new friends - sometimes it's fun for me to just jump into my cabal's mumble server and just banter."
TheSecretWorld,3c24w4,impossible_planet,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"It's the same as most mmos in that there is no specific buff or bonus gained. It's primarily a community, and there are multi-faction cabals also. These use 3 separate cabal rosters (1 for each faction) and chat in a custom chat channel.   For me personally my cabal mates are who I regularly run dungeons with, which is nice. If you're familiar with mmos you know pug groups can be hit or miss. It's nice to have a group of people who you get to know, form friendships and just in general have fun with.   The other thing is the custom chat channels I mentioned earlier. Right now with the anniversary event if you wanna hunt the guardians type /chat join event (you'll see custom chats typed as #event for example) There is also #noobmares which is a great place when you're ready to begin your nightmare mode dungeons. Lastly there is #sanctuary which is an amazing global chat channel used to help people with just about everything, and is also a community unto itself. #sanctuary can take the place of a cabal for a lot of people in that it's a similar type of help/support community you'd like to get from a cabal."

My suggested first step is going to this thread on the official forums and downloading the chat scripts that autolog you into a variety of custom chat channels when you log into the game. These are pretty much vital now.  Then use the chat channels #event for the current event related stuff like finding golems, #sanctuary for any questions you might have, and #noobmares for finding people for dungeon groups (get help from #sanctuary for getting your elite dungeons done)."

TheSecretWorld,3bu216,grrrly,3,Thu Jul 2 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who recently returned after a very long break, I would suggest that you just play your old character. It won't take long to get the hang of it again (once you remember how to get out of Agartha, if your return is anything like mine was!) It's really not worth losing all that AP."
TheSecretWorld,3bu216,DrunkColdStone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"That was my biggest caveat of starting a new character, just straight up losing all of those AP and SP, it's not like starting another character in another MMO that would be different in the long run, but since all abilities are on your character, I think it hurts more! haha"
TheSecretWorld,3bu216,Axiom2000,2,Thu Jul 2 05:48:18 2015 UTC,"You don't need to start a new character if you don't want to, people usually just do it to experience the story anew and get the background from other factions. If you are just interested in running end game content (which can be fun and challenging but isn't most people's favourite part of the game), it really depends on how far along you've come.  If you are most interested in dungeons: Do you have green, blue or purple gear? Have you done all Elite dungeons? Have you beaten the Gatekeeper? Have you run some Nightmare dungeons? Unless you had some serious experience in Nightmares, I'd suggest you join the #sanctuary channel and find some groups running elite dungeons and then you do each of them at least once. Then beat the Gatekeeper (if you haven't already) and join #noobmares to find PUGs that are happy to take new people on Nightmare runs, explain tactics and give build advice.  If you are interested in other end game content like lairs, raids, scenarios, and Tokyo it will be a bit different. If you haven't done any of them though, dungeons might be the best place to start. If you liked the story and atmosphere, picking up the issues released since launch will definitely be worth it (up until last week there was a big discount on the Ultimate Edition that gives you all released content + a base game key you can give to a friend but now it is back to 60 dollars/euro/pounds; that's something you might want to pick up at some point if you get back into the game but you don't need it straight away).  July 1st to 15th is the Anniversary event. All AP, black bulleon, white/black mark, aurei and AEGIS xp gain is boosted and there are big golems roaming around the mission zones that you can fight to get goodies so it is a pretty good time to get back into the game. Just join the #event channel, wait for someone to call out a golem and meet up on them (right click on their name in chat and select meetup).   So the best way to find other helpful people in the game is the use of custom chat channels that you can use from anywhere (so no need to just hang out in Agartha). In particular:   sanctuary is for helping new players and answering questions. Good place to get an elite dungeon group started as well but people don't recruit for end game content because it is aimed at new players. noobmares is technically for helping players new to Nightmare dungeon (i.e. ones who have recently beaten the Gatekeeper) but it is normal to start groups and ask advice for all sorts of end game content. In a pinch, you can try to get an elite dungeon group started here but #sanctuary is probably the better place for that (and many people are in both channels anyway). event is for calling out golem sightings during the Anniversary event and for other things during other events. For now if you want to go golem hunting just watch for the colourful announcement and MU (meet up) on the caller. lfg is not a custom channel so you have to be in Agartha or a dungeon to use it. It has a lot of jargon, assumes you are already familiar with the content and if you join a group from there you are unlikely to get people willing to explain the mechanics."
TheSecretWorld,3bu216,WearsALeash,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:30:37 2015 UTC,in addition to what DrunkColdStone wrote - each issue starting with 6th offers you 10.1 purple up-gradable equip for completing it (thats what people at end-game use) that should make it easier for you to do Gatekeeper and dungeons

It could be higher.   8 dollars per bag, each bag could in theory be up to  20 chances. (2 raid groups) Still, if it's 1,000 to 1, that's 400 USD . Some people will of cores get it in less ""rolls"". But for a new skin on a 3d model most people have already purchased that seems high.   Really if they're selling this as a lottery scratchers; they should reveal the statistical chances.

If on average 1 person per bag raid wins. Then the chances would be 1:400.   1:1000 puts the average at 1 bike per 2.5 bag raids. Keep in mind, that's one person in 20 getting a bike after spending 20 USD per person. or about  400 USD collectively.   I could be wrong. I only could find 20 bag raid groups to survey. a larger sample set could shift the results."

TheSecretWorld,3bsxj6,JanneMarttila,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:58:33 2015 UTC,"Each zone has a golem. The missions you get from killing a specific golem in a zone have a 2 hours cooldown. So after two hours you can kill the same golem again and get a reward again. Or better, during those 2 hours you can kill any of the other 8 golems (or I guess realistically 7 since you might not have access to Tokyo) :)"
TheSecretWorld,3bsxj6,Rinellie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:59:52 2015 UTC,The 2 hour cooldown was the missing piece of info for me. Thanks!

TheSecretWorld,3bsxj6,Axiom2000,5,Thu Jul 2 05:52:52 2015 UTC,"You also seem to have ignored the fact that a lot of games out there do double exp events and the community goes bonkers over them. Let's not downplay what double AP means, and how cool it is."
TheSecretWorld,3brjpr,Bldyknuckles,5,Wed Jul 1 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"You don't want maximum DPS for a newbie character.  You will need something called a ""solo survival"" build.  They focus on a good mix skills, including some AOE damage (for typical group mobs), a single-target nuker, and some self-healing.  Since you don't just magically get hitpoints as you progress (because there are no levels) you need some other ways to survive, which is typically by doing passive self-healing.    http://www.tswdb.com/builds/beginner-solo/  You won't need a max DPS build until you're doing dungeons, and even then, not until Elite dungeons.  These solo builds are pretty popular for running scenarios too, later on.    That said, to answer your question, that same link will have DPS builds listed in it as well on the menu.  :)"

The game comes with a month of membership benefits (excepting points apparently) and this could be why you are showing as having a membership even though your payment was denied.  As Raught said, contacting support will get to the bottom of this, just thought this might help explain what happened!"
TheSecretWorld,3bgfrk,Caledwch,8,Mon Jun 29 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"Well you can upgrade the quality of crafting materials. 5 of a lower tier will make 1 of the tier above it.   Aside from that just know that crafting your own weapons is honestly never really efficient. You can make a case for ql 10s right when you're able to wear them but for the most part you can just buy these pieces on the AH or get them from dungeon drops.   Speaking of dungeon drops, I'm guessing you're still in the ""leveling"" process and aren't trying to craft ql10s yet. There are dungeons that drop Ql 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 Blues. Between these and mission rewards your talismans stay fine. Weapons can be a bit trickier, but at the end of the day I'd still just advise going to the AH and buying what you want instead of crafting it.   If you're just experimenting with weapons then buying greens works just fine. If you're looking for a serious upgrade on your weapon get blue. This is all advice for pre-ql 10 as gear goals change drastically one you hit nightmares or get into pvp Venice gear.   Hopefully this helps, it's longer than I meant to be but oh well.   Tl;dr crafting weapons/talismans isn't really worth it vs obtaining drops/buying on AH"

TheSecretWorld,3bgfrk,RoflCrisp,2,Mon Jun 29 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"Something I've noticed, crafted items are never as potent as dropped items. For eg. I've got a ql4 uncommon necklace (say 350 health & 120 defense). I create a ql6 uncommon necklace with maybe 280 health & 75 defense. Whats up with that? Glyphs seem to stack up ok. Gonna try the ultimate crafter mods tho', cheers for the heads up."
TheSecretWorld,3bgfrk,Drakenul,3,Mon Jun 29 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"Nah crafted items will have the exact same amount of stats. Just crafted items won't come with glyphs. Now there is a difference in rarity but you said they were both uncommon. My best guess is that early gear drops have a combination of HP and AR or similar with HR. The game will still recognize them as a single type of piece for crafting purposes (AR/HP/HR pieces use different materials). What you're probably looking at are a ql 4 hp piece and a ql 6 ar piece that the game still tacks a little bit of health on to anyways. Defense is a stat only on glyphs, the only way the defense is lower on the ql 6 talismans is if it has a glyph with a ql lower than the glyph on the ql 4 talisman"
TheSecretWorld,3bgfrk,RoflCrisp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:09:28 2015 UTC,"It's possible too that that QL6 talisman has a glyph with more than just defense statted on it.  Glyphs with two stats balance how much of each they give based on how many of each rune you use (1/3, 2/2, or 3/1).  So if the QL4 has a defense only glyph in it, and the QL6 has a glyph with defense and something else in it, it's entirely possible that defense is the weaker stat and the other stat is higher."

TheSecretWorld,3bbzsx,wag3slav3,3,Sat Jun 27 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"The best way to get over the small population (it is an MMO afterall, population is a big deal) is to play it as you would any single player RPG. Get immersed in the lore and the characters. I think TSW was designed that way. It is probably the most lore-heavy MMO out on the market right now. If you make a couple friends along the way and wanna team up, go for it. Joining an active Cabal might be a good idea to have a place to socialize while questing. The dungeons themselves have backstories as well and it would be worth to run them even once just to experience it.  Useful resources are on the sidebar (unfair.co is awesome if you get stuck on an investigation quest) and if you want you can download some addons with the Curse client.  Have fun."

I remember a quest where you had to find different shops in kingsmouth and I checked the telephone book and wrote down the addresses just to realize that they were all marked on the map :(  I think the option to hide interactive items would be a bit too hard for me though xD"
TheSecretWorld,3bbzsx,Veraxnihon,3,Sun Jun 28 10:53:54 2015 UTC,"Excellent comments, thanks!  I joined Sanctuary chat last night and got in a Polaris group. Also got a shotgun and hammer blue upgrade on the run and picked a chaos focus at the end (I want to try some different combinations).  Very fun. (and I think I have the inner wheel for all 3 completed now).  As far as item highlighting goes - I thought it would make the game possibly too hard - but as it turns out when you are on a quest and there is an item, nearby (fairly close to you) that you can use, the game gives you a little on-screen message: ""Press (u) to take ......"" .  So it is not as obvious as the yellow highlight but still a pretty decent ""hint"".  Although thinking about it - there might be an option to turn that off as well....  I'm just having a blast with the quests now.  I installed a morse code translator on my phone yesterday. You don't get that with many games.  (I'll add clause as well.  Missed that yesterday.. :) )  edit:  one thing I wanted to add.  I grabbed the curse client to install a few addons.  I don't want to go crazy like I have with WoW..and ESO...  but the one that lets you save decks is awesome!!  I was able to grab a deck ""string"" from tswdb.com, paste it right into the deck builder and that deck was available to me in game.  I added a few starter decks I was interested in and it has really helped me get a better understanding of the system..and switch quickly back and forth to try things out.     Oh - and I also installed the crafting addon that streamlines that system quite a bit.  Much more user friendly now.  Last addon plug - one that shows you the current quest step text when you hover over your quest tracker.  Saves the step of clicking on that icon, opening up your journal and clicking on the current step.    Thanks!"

I've tried games like WoW and CoH & the only thing that made them difficult was the time investment & researching which builds were the best. With TSW I feel like there's actual puzzle solving and I never have to worry about picking the wrong skills because I there's no limit on them!  As for the low population, I just assume that I'll be questing on my lonesome & I get to be pleasantly surprised when I come across a friendly in the wild. I also love how the modern setting and costumes make most of the other humans blend in with the NPCs at a distance."

It really feels like a horror-ish genre, alot of the time you feel alone.  But.. If you WANT to be around other people, it's SUPER easy to do that! It's such a great game.  When I did my first dungeon, I loved the hide and go seek aspect(just for one boss XD)  Also, I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but if you're good at watching what others do, then it's easy to pick up the pace with the rest.

TheSecretWorld,3b9ezs,TexasKornDawg,3,Sat Jun 27 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"Crafting gear as you level? Not really. You can get better gear out of bartering sequins or doing dungeons. There are three reasons to hold onto crafting materials (at least of Sacred/Pure quality).   Augments require crafting materials to become attuned so you can use them. If you eventually get into nightmare dungeons, then you will want materials to create endgame runes to put in your gear.  Consumable potions require crafting materials. These can be helpful even for questing. You can make potions that increase your HP, crit rating, hit rating, etc. as well as healing potions.   If however you don't care about augments/scenarios, endgame content, or don't want/need consumables, then you can sell crafting materials. Depending on quality, you might get more money out of the AH/market rather than just vendors."
TheSecretWorld,3b9ezs,Tapkoh,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:33:09 2015 UTC,"Runes are pretty good to have around so you can tweak gear that has glyph slots to up desired stats. Crafting healing and stat pots tends to be pretty useful too, since it can be easy to run out of those. If you plan on getting far into end-game, it's pretty important to save mats for augments since they tend to use a lot.   Ninja edit: In case you don't know, you craft pots by using consumable toolkits that you get from (I think) chemists, which are vendors in every area. Each pot uses eight of the necessary mat to make a stack of three."

I've been where you seem to be right now, and it's a horrible feeling. Something you used to enjoy, and invested a lot of time in, just turns to shit in your eyes. You almost feel betrayed, and don't get why anyone else can enjoy something so bad.  In my case it was burn out from massively overplaying WoW, almost to addiction. I finally managed to quit and it did wonders for my psyche. The ting that got me out was actually TsW..   I loved the gritty adult stories, the refreshing way quests were presented, and for the first time in ages I felt pure enjoment playing an MMO instead of treating it as a chore with checklists that needed to be done.  I agree with you that quitting is probably for the best right now. Hopefully you'll find something to spark your love for gaming in the not too distant future. If you find an MMO that seems fun and challenging to you, try to find like minded people to enjoy it with. I play EVE which is boring as fuck 90% of the time gamewise, but the people I play with are pure gold."

It is obvious you do not like them game, and I am sorry that you do not feel you received adequate return on the money you ""invested"" (if $30-$50 spent is that life altering for you, maybe you shouldn't be buying video games).  What I, and most other people seem to be taking issue with in your rants, is that you are claiming the game is ""bad"" and anyone who likes it or defends it as ""fanbois"". What the fuck is wrong with this generation that they think simply because THEY don't like something, it automatically means it is bad. Get over yourself.  People play games for different reasons. Despite the bugs and faults that TSW has, IMO it has THE best story content on the marktet, of any genre or platform, period. There are other things I like about the game, but that is the primary reason I play.

In time, your opinions may change.  Or they may not.  You may find another game to enjoy.  Or you may start enjoying reality.  There are many options out there.  One thing I do appreciate in this (TSW reddit) sub is negative comments such as yours.  When all you see is a fanboi whitewash, it really freaks me out.  Nothing is perfect.  I expect there to be flaws.  When I know what & where they are, I can make a rational decision to enjoy the game in spite of them, or to flee in horror.  But when everything negative is downvoted, when we can discuss none of the failings, well that's a pretty horrifying place to be.  You have to find the flaws for yourself, and it hurts more when you do.  In time I expect I will get bored of TSW too.  But for me that is not today.  Actually I haven't gotten bored of the last 3 MMORPGs I've quit.  It's always been management removing skills and simplifying the game that drove me away.  I like options when I play.  TSW, for the moment, provides me with choices in how to play.  Most are suboptimal, but still interesting to explore."

TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,maxhavoc,6,Fri Jun 26 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"http://yokaiblog.wikidot.com/guides:weapon-choices  It's a bit dated, but still valid and a good start point.  The best way is to try for yourself.    Inner wheel skills are so cheap, try and find out for yourself.   Melee weapons start off with 5 resources, while ranged have 0 at start.    And remember you can use passives from any weapon tree, unless noted.  Keep in mind, some dungeon bosses are hard to get to with melee.   Having said that, hammer blade is a great PvP combo.    If you have questions, ask away."

TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,StevenTM,3,Fri Jun 26 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of blade + blood for soloing the open world.  It has a lot of AoE and survivability. Both weapons also have lots of afflictions, which means you can really start cracking skuls when you get Gross Anatomy."
TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,BlaineTog,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"Me too, but I've found that Surgical Steel from fist is a better heal for soloing than the cast time blood ones. Are there better self heals from blood with an instant cast?"
TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,StevenTM,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:30:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know about instant cast but I find The Scarlet Arts to be a fantastic way to survive even heavy bombardment, with Martial Discipline + Regeneration as backup when shit gets really real.  The channel time isn't that bad IMX."

TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,Axiom2000,2,Fri Jun 26 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"Ohhh boy.. This is going to be a tough one.  You can use any passive from any tree, which makes your qusetion very hard.  Ill try to focus on what i know and the actives  Pistols are good for crits and purges, and applying Weakness debuff  Shotgun is good for Penetration  Blood is good at Damage over time, Impairs and barriers  I think your question is WAY to broad.  The secret world has an amazing skill tree.  I can only tell you of some well known syergizes  Fist passive -- Lick the wounds?  (applies DOT every hit, goes away if glance)  Blood Passive elite -- Gross Anatomy (Does 180 damage eveyr time you apply a DOT, or if the DOT goes away)  Pistol Passive -- THe Business?  (Makes one of the pistols builders apply weakness every hit)  Pistol Passive -- ??  (Every time you hit a weakned target you do  extra damage)  Honestly, go to Crygaia and lookup a type (Penetration, critical, weakness, heal), then look at everything that triggers off of that."
TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,Exmond,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:55:48 2015 UTC,I can't believe you forgot the first tier pistol passive. The one that gives you move speed and crit on consumer use is amazing at low levels
TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,StevenTM,3,Fri Jun 26 21:17:04 2015 UTC,Could you believe it if i played low level 3 years ago ;)?
TheSecretWorld,3b7dku,Exmond,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:36:20 2015 UTC,"Total newbie here, still gathering my first few AP, but...  Blood:   Blood Shield x5 to build up (5) resources.  (Also heals faster between fights.)  (Or during them.) Blood Spike (-2 resources) Boiling Blood (+1 resource, both weapons) Blood Spike (-2 resources) Blood Spike (-2 resources)   Blood Spike is a DoT, but it does all it's damage at once if the Blood Spike DoT is already up.  If it hits that is.  This is tight on time, push the button (queue the next skill) ahead of time, but it seems like a great opener for the L1/L2 starting-out mobs in Kingsmouth.     To the original poster:  When you first start playing, before the first zone (kingsmouth), while you're still in your home base, you have to enter the training room.  You can try all 9 weapons out in there.  Select the two you want.  And it gives you guidance as for which weapons are designed for damage, damage + heal, or damage + tank.  There's also:  http://www.tswdb.com/builds/beginner-solo/  AP & SP appear to be unlimited.  You get more every so many XP you earn.  Many of the quests (missions) are repeatable (after a period of time, like 18 hours real-world), which makes it easier to earn (farm) more XP/AP/SP.  So you can switch weapons anytime.  (Though getting the AP to go deep into the wheel on your new weapons can take some time.)  Nevertheless, you will eventually earn every skill.  p.s. http://www.tswdb.com/miscellaneous/the-secret-world-beginner-guide/"
