Definitely hit up the Mountain View Cemetery. Designed by Frederick Olmsted (designer of Central Park), it's also home to huge amazing mausoleums of some of the bay areas richest old dead white people (Ghiradelli, Bechtal, Merrit, Crocker, etc). It's in a great neighborhood and is not at all creepy (plenty of people use it as a normal park, and they have tours/events/etc). There's a newer section further up the hill, but for the most part, you'll be walking around really old and spectacular grave-sites.   Tartine is great, but that's a big wait for sourdough. Depending on where the conference is, you can check out the ferry building at the end of Market, there's an Acme bakery there (for great bread) and enough smaller really amazing food stands to put together an epic picnic.   You can't skip out on a mission-style burrito. This can be the source of some serious arguments, but Pancho Villa and El Faralito are both great. Alcatraz is also actually totally fun and interesting (seriously), but you need a reservation.   Please do a really touristy thing and walk over the Golden Gate bridge. It's stupidly spectacular. Like seriously, give me a break already with your beauty bridge.   Also bring a jacket. Always. It's summer, so it's apt to get cold and shitty at any moment.

It also makes me remember getting my friend in trouble in high school because I lent him the ""Red Dwarf"" novels -- his parents were very religious and not as progressive as mine, and Dad flipped through the first couple chapters, found a brothel scene, and was like ""NOPE.""  (Interesting, since I think he was allowed to WATCH the show...)"
maximumfun,3cww7y,lidiacuervo,2,Sat Jul 11 22:03:41 2015 UTC,Whoa there are Red Dwarf novels? Like Red Dwarf the tv show? Would you say they still hold up?
maximumfun,3cww7y,Atom_Lion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:25:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, they hold up. They're well-written and go more in-depth into the sci fi plots in a way that the writers wanted to do on the show but were not able to. I particularly recommend the audiobooks narrated by Chris Barrie, who played Rimmer. I think they're still available on Audible."

maximumfun,3cww7y,superhelical,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"That CBC series sounds great. The book ""Jubilee"" by Margaret Walker is also a ""Roots""-style story told from the perspective of a woman (actually, Alex Haley was accused of ripping off this book, although having read both ""Roots"" and ""Jubilee"" I don't see the plagiarism). It's very, very good and captures the chaos of the Civil War extremely well.   My parents pretty much let me watch whatever, so the first piece of media that I tried to hide from my parents was probably a wide variety of slash fanfiction. I remember wanting to print some of it off and put it in a binder so I could read it in places besides the computer room but I was too scared to have that kind of evidence lying around."

But the Uggs and giant sunglasses sort of bled into the ought-tens too much to be pinned exclusively to the 2000s.  Weren't there also a lot of playboy bunny icons?

I feel like I'm beset on all sides by people trying to tell me Jurassic World was great and I can't deal with it.   I will say that the Bryce Dallas Howard scene at the end was the closest I came to not hating the movie. I agree with Jordan that she actually had a cool moment, and it was a nice little reprieve from the gross ""she's a monster for not wanting kids"" storyline. I also thought it was the one tiny part of the movie that was visually interesting/ wasn't shot like a car commercial, and on top of that, I was not prepared for how super hot BDH is. I never noticed until that moment."

It's funny the gang thought that would be a surprise choice by the director.  And I see Kate McKinnon as Egon. Kristen Wiig as Ray. I realize that does make Leslie Jones be Winston by default, but I swear that's just coincidence.   I think we need a new psychological profiling system where we judge your personality based on how you'd recast the Ghostbusters."

maximumfun,3c4d34,cinemkr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:09:41 2015 UTC,"Because there are no ""new"" stories, and 80% of what Hollywood does at all anymore is reboots.

maximumfun,3c4d34,Rachtacular,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:10:51 2015 UTC,"I kinda think this is apples and oranges.  Spiderman -- and all the superhero movies -- are comic book characters created for precisely the purpose of setting in multiple stories time and time again.  Yeah the reboots suck but those are mostly for the purpose of either retaining the story rights or recasting to a new generation.  GHOSTBUSTERS was an original idea. Paul Feig needs to go think up his own original ideas.  He's good at it. And he should be.  We went to the same high school (name drop).  BTW - if i might go on a pedantic tangent -- it should be pronounced ""Fay-g.""  ""Feeg"" would be spelled Fieg.  I understand the schoolboy giggle factor might be upsetting so I will give him ""F-eye-g"" which is a lesson common German pronunciation of the ""ei"" but possibly more palatable."

maximumfun,3c4d34,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:51:38 2015 UTC,I never said a reboot ruins the original one. I only said that it would be nice if producers would think up original ideas and leave the classic beloved ones alone.    Please name for me one remake of a classic movie that was better than the first?  Or more appropriately necessary?  For every one you may be able to pull out of your buttocks I can give you a half dozen that sucked.  Should we remake Casablanca (guess what? They did a tv show and it sucked.)  The Godfather?  Jaws?  Star Wars?  It's not about spoiling the original - it's about corporations trying to make the easy buck.  They already have your money as you said you are interested to see what they do with it.  Not that you are interested and excited about a fresh new entertainment concept or story.  It's a commentary of the sad state of film not about insulting my childhood memories.  Although they are.  It's all opinion.  You have yours.  I have mine.

Regarding finding out the sex of your baby before it's born: I've never really understood the ""we want it to be a surprise"" school of thought. It's not like you have a choice. No matter what you do, it's going to be a surprise. Whether you find out with the ultrasound or wait till delivery, in the moment that you find out, you're surprised."

maximumfun,3bbza6,HunterJE,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"That is a possibility I hadn't considered. Though, if there's a fight for artifacts so powerful that anyone who picks one up succumbs to its whim (with only one known exception), I don't think any member of the conflict has to be a good guy. My current theory is that there are going to be conflicts between the Bureau and whoever the outside force is and our protagonists are going to help the Bureau come out ahead by gathering the artifacts. Once this external force is defeated the Administrator is going to say ""lol thanks"" and immediately turn on them, resulting in a kickass boss battle."
maximumfun,3bbza6,rwilco,3,Sat Jun 27 19:56:03 2015 UTC,"I went back and started listening at the beginning. Something noteworthy is that magic Brian can talk about the gauntlet and as we learn during their first visit to the moon, Cillian is not in the retrieval department but she is in the policing department. So magic Brian most likely was hired by the bureau to retrieve the gauntlet, and Cillian or the administrator figured out that he would keep it for himself. Imagine the reveal that wasn't seen by the adventurers in the mine because they were fighting the crusher. Brian dramatically informs Cillian that he is the Black Spider and she shrugs and tries to shoot him with the crossbow.   So maybe the Bureau isn't bad - power attracts all types and Brian could've been a bad apple. Jenkins was probably just a serial-killing thief who figured out there was something valuable on the train and wanted to get it. If the adventurers continue on and destroy all these relics, think of how powerful they and the bureau would be. That's the thing - the bureau doesn't need to hide it's power grab because it has good intentions. Maybe the administrator has a relic that nobody knows about but so what? Better to be in the hands of her than deranged dwarves and weirdo wizards.   That being said I gladly wait to be proven wrong"
maximumfun,3bbza6,HunterJE,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:15:56 2015 UTC,"Better to be in the hands of her than deranged dwarves and weirdo wizards.   I'm not necessarily sure this is the case, considering the powerful mind control(-esque) properties the artifacts have. I can definitely see the Administrator having good intentions in setting up the Bureau, perhaps intending everything that she eventually told the party. But it's so easy to just see one, and once you've seen it, it makes you want to pick it up. Pick it up once and, barring a will check that in-universe is very difficult to pass (remember her reaction to [whichever one of them carried the gauntlet] not succumbing?) all is basically lost. We've only seen people go mad with an artifact's power, but why can't one just make you twisted? I can see someone being driven by an artifact to become more scheming, not showing their cards until they have enough power to be unstoppable. Imagine an evil Administrator running an organization as powerful as the Bureau, with even her own men being out of the loop. It's pretty scary.  I don't think your theory about a lust for power driving Brian to go bad conflicts with mine. The Administrator has to keep up appearances, so it makes sense for her to be strict about how Bureau members handle the artifacts. At the same time, though, I don't think the motive for taking out Brian was ""He's going to keep something that must be destroyed"" the way that Cillian thought it was. It was ""That's mine, you fuck""."

I'm sure Brian had already done that, but I just pumped it up some more. It probably disgusts an actual audio producer like Brian, but it is easier to hear in a car.

When Jesse said JMo's microphone was off, I thought it'd be like you couldn't hear him at all and would get to make up what Jordan said.

maximumfun,3arksm,dannydpr,7,Tue Jun 23 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, full version definitely worthwhile -- Jordan's test drive adventures were excellent.  It just sounds like he's participating via speakerphone.  If you're using headphones, it's completely listenable."

maximumfun,3as0bl,ellepav,3,Tue Jun 23 03:42:34 2015 UTC,I just assumed that the donation drive gave MaxFun data about which podcasts had listeners willing to pay for the content. I'm guessing shows that had little support either decided to try greener pastures or were asked to go.

In front of the fence is a bench, on which sits Joseph Hart as the cartoon character of Foxy Grandpa, reading a newspaper or magazine. He sports a bald pate with white bushy hair on the sides, a large bulbous nose, and a potbelly, and wears spats with a light-colored suit, vest, and tie. From stage right enter two mischievous boys, ""Chub"" and ""Bunt,"" dressed in matching suits with short pants to the knee and dark stockings, boots, and caps. One of the boys carries a banjo. They stop and gesture at Foxy Grandpa, laughing, and hand him the banjo when he looks up and notices them. As the boys laugh and poke each, Grandpa begins to play the banjo like a pro, inducing the boys to engage in a bit of tap or shuffle dancing. When they finish, Foxy Grandpa takes the floor while providing his own music on the banjo. As the boys clap and watch in amazement, Grandpa tap dances and performs advanced movements such as split kicks. Closes with all three dancing offstage.   lol"

Side note: has Bullseye been pared down to the two interview segments now? For creative reasons or financial reasons?
maximumfun,3a39pa,IdealizedSalt,4,Wed Jun 17 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"We dropped the critic recommendations segments like six months ago when Nick left, mostly though not exclusively for financial reasons. Basically we thought they added to the show but people were only kind of into them, so we might as well use that time with extra interview.  We also decided not to have a third (fourth, counting the outshot) segment in every show. We're doing those in many shows, but things like Canonball, Song That Changed My Life, etc take a lot of staff time because they're production intensive, so we're doing them when we can rather than always."

maximumfun,3a1lr0,supermariosunshin,7,Tue Jun 16 14:55:13 2015 UTC,I would think the McElroys have a bit of a different energy than Dave and Graham.
maximumfun,3a1lr0,QuickPhix,8,Tue Jun 16 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"Dave's whole thing is being hilariously boring, so that makes sense"
maximumfun,3a1lr0,YellowOrangeRed22,7,Tue Jun 16 17:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that is what it is. They definitely seem to present more as ""Rockstars of Comedy"" (or something like that) at their live shows than Dave and Graham. They are really great at harnessing the energy of a live performance and jumping into complete showmanship. I think that is a big part of it.  I also think the McElroys distance themselves from their fans less than SPY. They have expressed many times, live and in the podcast, how grateful they are for their audience. Dave does a pretty good job of keeping the audience at arms length, and treats them with the same mild disdain as he does everything. Which is ok because he does disdain better than anyone, but I don't think it encourages people to become mega-fans at the live shows. (As a side note, after the last SPY live show's ending, I cannot blame Dave and Graham at all for keeping their distance from the live fans. And being in the stand-up comedy world for so long probably hasn't helped them to love their fellow man either.)"
maximumfun,3a1lr0,smartbunny,8,Tue Jun 16 20:34:50 2015 UTC,I don't read disdain from Dave. He's the straight man and he's very dry. He comes out with shit that slays me.
maximumfun,3a1lr0,YellowOrangeRed22,2,Wed Jun 17 02:45:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I definitely would say there is some disdain there. He seems to regard strangers as just a bunch of silly people to supply overheards. As far as casting this disdain on the audience, the example that springs to mind was when some fans had sent some stuff to them, and Dave was wholly unimpressed and said something along the lines of ""don't send us dumb stuff"".  That said, I think he is one of the funniest people ever, and he perfectly balances with Graham's more eccentric personality. And I think he's exceptionally hilarious when that hint of derision comes out (as in the Chris Gordon episodes, for example.)"
maximumfun,3a1lr0,smartbunny,3,Wed Jun 17 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"Andy Breckman (from Seven Second Delay) and Jimmy Pardo (from Rollicking Good Fun-Time Jams with Pardo and Friends) have the Fan Disdain that I recognize. Dave seems a bit ""over it"" but I never get the same vibe."
maximumfun,3a1lr0,YellowOrangeRed22,2,Wed Jun 17 05:22:18 2015 UTC,"I don't listen to either of those! Maybe my perception of it is skewed from listening to mostly MaxFun podcasts, because it seems like in general they have a positive attitude towards the audience."
maximumfun,3a1lr0,mannequin_hands,4,Thu Jun 18 03:13:05 2015 UTC,"Good point! I imagine you want to keep people at a distance when your performance experience is standup comedy, like Dave and Graham. It can get ugly.  The McElroys got podcast-famous without being face to face with fans and/or a crowd. That affects how they relate to fans now, for sure."
maximumfun,3a1lr0,respite,4,Tue Jun 16 20:40:06 2015 UTC,What happened at the last SPY live show?
maximumfun,3a1lr0,YellowOrangeRed22,6,Tue Jun 16 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"Possibly the most awkward moment in podcasting history. It was the live show fundraising for Dave's friend, with Alicia Tobin and Charlie Demers. They let members of the audience come up and say an overheard at the end, and the final guy was quite drunk and apparently misread the room or didn't get the show at all, and it got pretty cringeworthy. Of course Dave and Graham and the guests handled it in the best possible way, but it probably didn't do much for their love of their audience."
maximumfun,3a1lr0,respite,4,Tue Jun 16 22:14:04 2015 UTC,Yeesh.
maximumfun,3a1lr0,mannequin_hands,12,Tue Jun 16 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the nail on the head with the running gag thing. People like feeling in on the joke, and a certain type of person likes quoting stuff as a way to feel connected to a community (think Monty Python fans). I think that's why the MBMBaM Facebook page became a circlejerk of links to horse and ghost stuff for a while.  I also think the McElroys seem accessible, like they could be people you know from your hometown. They're like your buddies. Normal dudes. And they're such friendly and affable people - when you meet them, they're super nice and willing to take a pic with you or whatever.  They also have some fans from the videogame world, and no one ever said videogame fans weren't a little rabid sometimes. (I mean this in a nice way.)  It appears (at least in my experience) that there's also a good chunk of MBMBaM fans who aren't MaxFunsters in general. They are super into the show but haven't experienced the general lovely, sincere, low key but passionate, friendship-y culture of MaxFun yet. Maybe that has something to do with it.  All of this, along with the fact that the brothers are straight up hilarious, adds up to that sort of culture-feeling you're experiencing. I felt it a little when I was at Candlenights, so I get it."

maximumfun,3a1lr0,mullacc,3,Tue Jun 16 19:15:38 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't the live shows in NYC have anything to do with MaxFun?
maximumfun,3a1lr0,smartbunny,3,Tue Jun 16 21:32:27 2015 UTC,I just don't think they are organized by Maxfun and would have taken place even if MBMBAM wasn't part of Maxfun.

Also I think there's something special about a podcast hosted by family; because the shows are at the intimacy level of three hosts who have known each other all their lives, the fake intimacy that is always a part of podcast listening experience is greatly enhanced.

Centred on the sport of curling, the offbeat comedy tells the story of a reunited curling team from a small Canadian town as they work through their respective life issues and struggle to win the championship for the sake of their late coach.  The cast also includes Connor Price, Leslie Nielsen, Peter Outerbridge, Kari Matchett, Molly Parker and Polly Shannon. Members of the Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip make a cameo appearance in the film as a competing rink representing Kingston, Ontario, the band's home city. Winnipeg curler and three-time Brier champion Jeff Stoughton also made a cameo appearance throwing his trademark ""spin-o-rama"" shot.

I don't really play video games, so I am pretty ignorant to the whole situation. That said, I really didn't get much out of the conversation. Other than a basically unanimous agreement that Grand Theft Auto successfully (if problematically) utilized people of color (Jesse's term, not mine), the rest of the discussion was a muddle.  I couldn't follow the logic of the conversation. On the one hand, they lambast some polish company for making a game about medieval poland that doesn't include people of color, but does include dogs of color. The assumption being that ""authenticity"" of the time and place would not necessarily lend itself to advancing multiculturalism was poo-pooed by the panel with the general theme of ""this is all make believe, so rainbow it up people!"" (but not literally rainbow people).  Then Oliver, I think, pointed out that most sports games do embrace authenticity in races portrayed in the time and places that they cover. No one wants to see a white-washed Madden or NBA game.  Look, I am not particularly well versed in the nuances of racial, minority and gender perspectives. I listen to a lot of MaxFun podcasts precisely to hear voices outside of my community. That said, on this topic, I didn't get a sense of any cogent message or theme other than the panelists, and some segment of ... I don't know who, want more people of color in video games.

maximumfun,39mapo,attentiondivided,2,Tue Jun 16 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"Jesse was referring to this article about the lack of diversity in the game The Witcher 3 and recent changes in Rust.  I like video games, but I've not played these two, but I've heard this weird logic a lot. A game, film, or television series has a great deal of fantasy elements, but little if any diversity in its characters, the reason you will hear is based on the region it's about or where the creators are located or about historical (not lore based) accuracy. It's a real head scratch when you can have dragons, magic swords, talking plants, but not humans of different ethnic backgrounds.  I think the point was having a lighter conversation at the cross section of two topics that people get very passionate about, games and race.    I remember one game that tried this and I can't understand why Guild Wars: Nightfall didn't get more recognition for creating a more diverse landscape with this expansion. The art of this game was great and the customization of it's characters was just so amazing."

All that was very enjoyable. But your next statement really really moved me. I was thinking ""I don't know if this is the most beautiful thing. It's beautiful, but it is also haunting and calming, isolated, almost like a calm cry for a hand, or an assured demand that I listen and attend to it, without being forceful.""

Though I actually had an alternate theory at the time that it was not referring to ""going down"" in the oral sex sense but rather to disrobing from the waist down, based (A) the similarity in sound between ""bridge"" and ""britches"" and (B) the repetition of the first syllable of London as ""Lond-ey lond-ey lond-ey"" rhyming with ""undies.""

I hate that god damned song so much, but it was inescapable for the bulk of Summer 92.  On a happier note, ""We got the beat"" by the Go-Gos was playing at the house of the girl who talked my best friend and me into playing spin the bottle, 7 minutes in heaven, and almost into strip poker.

I follow Phish for part of that summer. It was amazing. I don't know what my parents were thinking. Harvey Danger: Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone - Flagpole Sitta may have been overplayed, but it is a straight up jam.

My parents had a copy of their CD Lawn Boy that I swiped from them when I was in 6th grade because it had cover art that looked very ""alternative rock"" to me and because I knew that my cool, young aunt liked phish a lot.    The song ""reba"" has a line that goes, ""bag it, tag it, sell it to the butcher,"" but when I listened to it for the first time I thought they were saying, ""faggot, faggot, sell it to the butcher,"" which I took to mean that Phish were supporting murdering and eating gay men.  So I really hated them for a long time.    Eventually, I learned that I was mistaken and I came to appreciate some of their songs, but for a long time it really messed up my opinions of the numerous people in my life who dug them."

I teach, which means I get more time for the sort of activities I can't do without music. So far I have two pretty serious summer jams.  1.) First is Odesza - Say My Name (feat. Zyra)  This came out last September, but I didn't hear it until recently. The beat, the processed and  chopped-up vocal... It's easy to say there are some clichés in it, but the song gets me exactly where every summer song should: moving and singing along.  That is actually a perfect segue to my second jam:  2.) Walk The Moon - Shut Up and Dance  Seriously, how is this not everyone's summer jam? Everything about it screams summer: it's bouncy, corny, has a themed video that digs for nostalgia in a place that everyone can reach... And my five year old loves it. We belt it out pretty hard in the car with all the windows down. It is unabashedly pop music, and that's absolutely wonderful sometimes.  I'd like a more frequent check in on summer jams. Perhaps the subreddit should have a summer jams sticky?  And shout to the network and the show. I resisted for a while because I worry that letting one place take up so much of my attention biases me, but Pop Rocket is an excellent addition.

maximumfun,38j0qp,nohorseman,7,Thu Jun 4 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"I am also curious about how Griffin would have allowed the plot to unfold if things had gone differently. This campaign contains an unusually large number of out-of-combat saving throws and skill checks in really critical situations, to the point where the entire plot could become completely unhinged entirely by chance. Griffin has already shown willingness to kill off popular NPCs and destroy entire cities based on the party's actions. Would he allow the group to become refugees from the BoB because of a single failed saving throw on the thrall effect? How about a TPK if the party had failed the spell check to get into the engine car on the second or third try? And would he play it by ear, or does he already have alternate story lines prepared?"
maximumfun,38j0qp,pastamagician,5,Thu Jun 4 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the super critical rolls are ""fail forward"" rolls, where a failure isn't ""all is lost"" but rather ""things go awry in a way that is annoying and requires change of plans but in a way that also moves the story forward.""

Then when I researched it, it turns out that Plumpy'nut is for the severely malnourished (ie starving children in Africa) and is not commercially available.  Super disappointing.  Soylent sounds like it could eventually end up being something I could use as an easy way to get in calories, but I'm going to wait for them to work on the formula some more.  Chronic gas is something that would destroy my digestive system. :p"

As Ricky mentioned, it has a slow first act, but really ramps up in the final act.  It's refreshing to experience that when so often movies just fall apart in the third act.  It's almost acceptable b/c of its frequency.    Because of this movie Tony Leung is one of my favorite actors.    I also really appreciated Brady's theory that this movie is about multiple personalities (dissociative disorder).  It really holds up.  I had never thought about it that way.

Under the Bros' assumption, the ideal situation would be for nobody to buy any bagels, but of course in the long run that would lead to NO bagels being given away, since the shop would go under.  This can be generalized to other demand levels. Generally, the shop is going to want to produce enough to serve the expected customers, with some cushion to avoid running out and having to turn customers away (and therefore possibly losing their future business). Pulling a number out of nowhere, let's say they make 10% too much.  Let's also simplify by saying they decide how many bagels to make by how many sold the previous day (or if you want to avoid in-week fluctuation, that day the previous week). In that case, by buying a bagel today, you increase the total expected sales, and therefore ALSO increase the size of that 10% share. So actually buying the bagel means more donated bagels in the long run.  Lots of simplifications here, but you can feel better about buying that bagel..."

But his brother, the Great Brain, explains that with too many extra kids, the mom won't be able to leave a lot of leftovers for all of them, and will just stop leaving deliberate leftovers.

maximumfun,382akq,smartbunny,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:42:22 2015 UTC,They don't need to park. Just put the boat in. I don't think anyone will care. That whole park is a lawless zone.
maximumfun,382akq,cinemkr,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:45:10 2015 UTC,"Hate to argue.  But I guess I will.    The closest parking where you might get a trailer with a boat (it will need a trailer even if it is a skiff) is 100 yards away from the lake's edge -- and on the opposite side the lake from the boat ""ramp.""  In any event a boat -- even a small one -- is heavy. So carrying it that far will suck.  Using the ramp will require park permission because it is locked.  But if you formulate plan to overcome even these few obstacles -- and there are many more -- they would be shut down rather quickly.  It's on one of the busiest corners in Los Angeles and if a boat is on the lake it will be noticed and the cops and park rangers.  They are there all the time due to the homeless and crime issues.  Usually a cop car parked in the red zone on 7th or on Wilshire.  I am sure the LAPD would be on it, LAFD and probably even a passing news van.  Again...it would be a great a great podcast.  But they might be able to get a permit."
