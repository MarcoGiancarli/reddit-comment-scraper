Technology is complicated and either the salespeople that sold you on your plan should have instructed you better/asked better questions or, less likely, you should have done better research.  T-Mobile's terms aren't bullshit. They're industry-leading away from bullshit like AT&T's reinvention of activation fees. From the beginning, if you'd talked it all the way through with the likes of /r/NoContract, we would have sent you to Cricket from the beginning. Yes this is me being a Monday morning quarterback and I shouldn't bust your chops too much on it but you're using a lot of strong condemnation where it's not really necessary. This shoe doesn't fit you, that doesn't mean that the shoe is defective.  Also, you're not on a contract, you owe money on phones. These are very different things. You can unlock your phones now and continue paying on them if you want to go to Cricket as the other posters have mentioned. Cricket is probably your best choice considering your grievances. Just keep in mind that iPhones don't have the best reception and they're completely missing one of tmo's best frequency bands.

NoContract,3e4v7h,zakats,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:19:04 2015 UTC,"Here is the billing bullshit, I really didn't want to bog the entire thread down. It is my fault, if I had been told in any way by T-Mobile's billing system that it worked this way, I would've avoided it. I could've called and asked. To some extent it happened because I wanted to let it, and see how it worked out. It worked out in a way that made me feel I do not want to do business with T-Mobile.  I got a raise.  I decided to spend that raise paying off my phones early instead of on nachos. Let's say my normal bill is $100 and I paid $20/month per phone on my account, making the bill total $140. So long as I paid exactly this, I was fine.  So when I got a paycheck, I logged onto T-Mobile's site and set up a new EIP payment for $50. Later, when I got paid again, I paid $50 again. A few days later, I logged on to pay my bill. Curiously, my balance was not $140, but $0. Huh. OK. I thought about calling, but I was working long shifts and didn't really have a chance. I had some buffer money so I decided to see how this played out.  Next month, my bill included these line items:   Normal bill: $100 Normal EIP payments: $50 EIP credits (""This is not a charge!""): $100 Total Due: $250   I... uh... I'm not sure what T-Mobile means by ""This is not a charge"", but things that make my balance owed larger are charges. But when I did all the math, everything seemed to total up. I should've called again. But I was still working overtime, and it wasn't a priority. I paid the $250 bill, then this month only paid $50 extra towards EIP. Next month's bill: $100 + $50 + $50 (""This is not a charge!"") This time I called, because I was done with the project that made it impossible for me to spend an hour on the phone.  The cheery rep explained it to me this way, and assured me it was simple. The algorithm for paying your T-Mobile bill is as follows:   EIP and your normal account balance are two separate entities. The internet payment system cannot actually post payments to your EIP account, unless your balance is 0. So, if your balance is not $0:   The system posts a credit to your balance. This is displayed on the bill. If you paid $50, your new balance is $bill - $50. The system schedules a ""EIP payment, not a charge"" next month, that will add a charge to your balance. Since it's not next month yet, this is not on your bill. If you get confused and pay the big number next to ""Total Due"" on your bill, you made a mistake. You're gonna get hosed by the $50 charge that isn't visible on the bill.  The internet system in T-Mobile stores is Super Internet, and it can pay the EIP balance directly, without following that algorithm.   That process makes sense, in the ""software engineer"" way. It is a process that, if you owe $100 and pay $150, eventually results in an account balance of $0 with a $50 deduction to EIP. What doesn't make sense to me is apparently T-Mobile has designed a system that can't pay itself without goofy hacks. Work with me here, this is what my bank did with my checking and savings accounts:   When I post a $50 deposit to savings, the money goes into my savings account. When I post a $50 deposit to checking, the money goes into my checking account.   I guess that's what you get if you have bank money to spend on software developers, right? I sure do wish T-Mobile's plan worked that way. But uh, wait. I have to pay my landlord for both my rent and utility bills. She uses the same trick as my bank!  The system ""makes sense"". But it is overcomplicated and very inconvenient that for some reason I can't directly pay my EIP balance, and if I don't do it in a very specific way I can accidentally underpay T-Mobile, then get charged the difference later. I almost wonder if it isn't designed to trip up people who didn't expect it, and can't pay the extra money next month. Then they get happy little ""definitely a charge"" late fees, right? And it's all their fault, because who designs a system where when you say ""pay account B"", the money goes in account B? (Spoiler: people I like to do business with design those systems.)  Again, sure, in the end it's all my fault. I missed the meeting with the PowerPoint on this process, and in the end T-Mobile doesn't have a dollar I didn't actually owe them. But I am agitated because this system is convoluted, and if I were a good bit less intelligent I'd have no clue what the hell happened. Instead I got my answer to, ""Wait, is this a glitch that technically doubles EIP payments?"" It's not. It's a business practice that feels a little more deceptive than I like.  I figured all of this out last month. Then, this month, I found out that there's this miniscule 50MB cap to off-network roaming I had no clue existed, and there is literally no way I can pay T-Mobile to increase it. I was willing to pay a stupid amount to get rid of the cap, so we don't have to have a ""Why the hell did we switch to T-Mobile?"" conversation again. She hates it. The coverage in the places she travels is far shittier than the coverage map implies. I like it, getting the amount of data we use for this price is impossible anywhere else. We've already had one ""Why the hell are we on T-Mobile?"" conversation, followed by ""Actually I don't care if it's $40/month more to use a different carrier."" T-Mobile's got a big-ass promise of unlimited roaming in Canada and Mexico. I am sure that, if I were aware of all of the variables, it would make sense why this is paired with ""Almost no roaming at all"" in the United States. But you know what? I'm a dumbass customer, and I think I would be happier if I could use my phone on the shores of Lake Michigan more than I would be knowing that if I ever end up in Guadalajara T-Mobile's got me covered. I don't buy it, either. Last time I was in Toronto, I had No Service the entire time, and there was tons of information on T-Mobile's site about ""Now we have global data roaming!"". I'm there again in September, we'll see what happens.  AT&T's roaming cap is 400MB. That's still kind of shitty, but it's sufficient for my wife. When we were on AT&T a couple of years ago we never had service issues. Now it seems like every time we leave Austin our phones are useless. It's getting harder for me to feel happy I'm saving money on the bill. It's worse when I get a different bill every month. I switched from AT&T because it looked like I was getting a better deal for less money. It's turned out to be a slightly worse deal for less money. I think AT&T provides a better value. And they never sent me a bill that asked for a number different from what I owed them.  (I also argue the semantics of 'not a contract'. I have a fixed price, that T-Mobile isn't changing. I have fixed terms of service, that T-Mobile is not able to modify without following other fixed terms. If T-Mobile fails to deliver, I'm owed things outlined in those terms and decided by a (probably arbitration) court. There is an amount of money that, if I want to leave these terms, I have to pay T-Mobile and they can seek legal recourse if I fail to do this. That this amount of money is a number that dwindles over time doesn't really change that it looks like a contract, walks like a contract, and quacks like a contract. You can call it ""an agreement"" or ""a plan"", but to me it's a ""legally binding set of terms with a cost attached to breaking the various terms"". It doesn't matter, really. I'm more mad about "")"

NoContract,3dvacy,motiusclyde,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, but compared to an unlocked GSM model, it will get less LTE reception. All Verizon LTE phones are unlocked but they only support Verizon's LTE bands, and Verizon only shares Band 4 with GSM carriers, the others just won't work. The impact of this will vary depending on what Bands the specific carriers are using in your area (as well as whether or not LTE coverage is important for your usage).  Best thing to do would be to order service from your carriers of choice, and if it seems lacking, look into selling the phone and buying a more compatible one."

Beware, many Verizon Android phones do not let you change access point name and SMSC settings, which makes using them with other carriers harder. The phone will also periodically bug you about not having a Verizon SIM in it, but that can be ignored. The phone comes unlocked out of the box, so you don't need to worry about bugging Verizon for an unlock code or paying for one.  No stupid questions! What, do you think you're wasting our time?

Now as for networks, if you can handle 3G only, you could get a family plan with Cricket (since the HTC One won't have the right LTE bands). To put you on the 5gb plan and your wife on the 2.5gb plan, total monthly cost would be $80.   Another option is Virgin Mobile's Data Sharing. It's on the Sprint network so everything would be compatible and you and your wife could share 6gb of data with unlimited talk and text for $65 a month. I'm not sure about how to bring your phone over to them since they don't seem to have a legitimate BYOP program. It looks like some people have had success doing it, though.  Finally, Net10 offers $85/month service with 5gb of unlimited data for people who bring their own phone. I'm not sure entirely how this works, I think you'd get 5gb of high speed data for bringing your own phone and your wife would get 3gb since she has to buy a phone? I could be wrong.  I've used all of the above services and my favorite is Cricket. But your phone won't get LTE which is a huge bummer.

NoContract,3dq348,Askeji,3,Sun Jul 19 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"I have no personal experience with using phones overseas, just basing this off of what I can find online.  Quick and dirty LTE breakdown, doesn't really include smaller operators:   China: 38/MFBI, 39, 40, 41 Taiwan: 3, 8, 28 Japan: 1, 11, 18 (au).  1, 3, 9, 19, 21, 28 (NTT). 1, 3, 9 (Softbank) Thailand: 1 India: 40 South Korea: 3, 8 (KT). 1, 5, 7 (LG U+). 1, 3, 5 (SK Telecom) US: 2, 4, 12/17 Australia: 1, 3, 7, 28, 40 (Optus). 3, 28 (Telstra). 3, 5 (Vodafone)   So based off the above, I think the best way to go would be the Galaxy Note 4 N910G, which has LTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 28, 38, 40 and quadband GSM/HSPA.  Quick search suggests it's only being sold in Singapore, India, and Australia, so you'll probably have to buy it online.  In China, you'd have to go with China Mobile (LTE 38 & 40), which uses GSM.  China Telecom uses CDMA for 2G/3G, which the above version of Note4 doesn't have.  As for the other countries:  Taiwan (any), Japan (NTT & Softbank best, au is acceptable if you know you're going to be in a B1 area), Thailand (any), India (any), South Korea (any), US (T-Mobile. AT&T has some B2 and B4 areas, and they have better coverage for call/text, but their primary LTE band is 17, but you'll still be able to get HSPA+ 3G coverage), Australia (any).  As for international service providers, I have no clue, but I suspect that the cheapest way would be to buy a prepaid service from a local store in the country.

NoContract,3dq348,Askeji,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:27:08 2015 UTC,"The other Note4's do not have all of the LTE bands necessary to cover all of the countries you'll be travelling to.  For example, looking at the gsmarena page, none of the other models have the 38 and above bands used in China and India. (Most other phones have their LTE bands tailored to the specific region they're being sold in, so that specific Note4 is the only one that covers them all that I could find based off a quick search.)  I'm not too familiar with Xiaomi products, as none of their phones typically have the LTE bands used in North/Central America.  Looking at the phones listed on gsmarena's Xiaomi page, some have LTE 3 & 7, 38 & 39 & 40 & 41, or both (example: http://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_4i-7211.php).  With those bands, you should be able to get LTE coverage in Taiwan via Band 3 (although it might depend on what the local cell providers have rolled out in each area, as most providers broadcast on B28 in some areas, with potentially no overlap), and Australia via B3 and B7 (same situation as in Taiwan: provider might have B3 in some areas, but other bands in other areas).  Of course though, if you travel out of an LTE area, you'll still be able to fall back to HSPA or at least GSM.  Try poking around gsmarena and see if there are any other phones that suit your connection requirements.

NoContract,3dpjnb,david12795,2,Sat Jul 18 05:13:51 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that Cricket is an AT&T MVNO, while T-Mobile is not. The phone is reported stolen on AT&T's network, and they don't share that information with T-Mobile and T-Mobile MVNOs. So T-Mobile's sim cards are working fine.  Even if you enter random numbers to just get a nano sim, you might still have service issues with AT&T or its MVNOs after the next time AT&T does an IMEI sweep.  My ex was on AT&T, and it took them about a month to detect that she was using an iPhone instead of a flip phone, and was charged smartphone rates immediately.  EDIT: So what I'm trying to say is that Cricket will probably block service to the phone after it detects the lost/stolen IMEI. So don't go with AT&T and the MVNOs with that phone."

The goto lately is Cricket: $35 for unlimited talk/text and 2.5gb of data on AT&T's network. But of course there may be other options that fit better depending on your usage.

The $50 plan even lets me use my phone as a hotspot for no additional cost.  Only caveat is that you have to prove that you are a business owner in order to use them.

Personally, I don't talk on the phone that much, so I'm happy with T-Mobile's $30 plan as a single-line user. 100 minutes, unlimited text, and 5GBs.  Plus, when I do run low on minutes, I can always use Google Voice as my backup since it runs on data.  Also, it helps that I live in an area where T-Mo has great reception.

I'm not saying there aren't other providers that aren't good, but combine Cricket's great value with seemingly large advertising budget and you have a lot of exposure to the market.

The Verizon iPhone 5C is compatible out of the box with the AT&T and T-Mobile networks.  Also, if your dad ends up going with Verizon postpaid, he wouldn't have to sign a contract to use phones that he and his girlfriend already own, or phones that they buy at full price(from Verizon or elsewhere).

NoContract,3d9mad,mdezzi,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:45 2015 UTC,I am on ST. I pay $45/mo + tax for 5gb. I have no complaints about ST other than their non-existent customer service. I pay in 3 month increments to save $5 and offset most of the tax. I don't see any slow down in data or dropped calls. I am able to send and receive MMS with no problems.
NoContract,3d9mad,anothercookie90,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"ST uses both AT&T and T-Mobile towers correct?  My AT&T coverage is pretty spotty, especially in my home which sucks.  Piggybacking with T-Mobile towers would be an upgrade actually. ST offers nationwide coverage correct?"
NoContract,3d9mad,fly_eagles_fly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:47:42 2015 UTC,Straight Talk uses either AT&T or T-mobile for GSM devices depending on the SIM card you use.    If you have a Verizon phone you could also get Straight Talk for Verizon
NoContract,3d9mad,fly_eagles_fly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:44:44 2015 UTC,Might be worth mentioning I paid for my Galaxy S6 upfront so I am on No Contract plan.  So current cost for 3GB plan is $65 I believe.  I think sharing 10GB with someone in similar situation would cost the same?
NoContract,3d9mad,fly_eagles_fly,2,Tue Jul 14 16:07:31 2015 UTC,I highly recommend checking out Cricket.  Data limited to 8 Mbps. No roaming (doesn't affect too many people) and works off AT&T network. You could save a lot of money if you switch and find a group plan to join.  With AT&T postpaid: $75/mo (including your taxes and fees) x 12 = $900/yr  With Cricket: $20/mo (including your taxes and fees) x 12 = $240/yr  That's a savings of $660 a year!
NoContract,3d9mad,fly_eagles_fly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"Cricket doesn't give access to all of AT&T towers and would be lower priority to other AT&T customers, or so I have been told."
NoContract,3d9mad,fly_eagles_fly,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"Cricket is owned by AT&T. You get access to all of AT&T's towers. As for the lower priority, you are routed through Cricket proxy servers but most people don't notice a difference.  As for roaming, there are only a select few areas you would notice this. For example, North and South Dakota has local carriers that AT&T roams too. If you were AT&T postpaid and went to these areas, you would be roaming but you'd still have coverage and be able to make phone calls. If you had Cricket, it would simply say no service.  If you live in these areas it's a big issue, otherwise it's not."
NoContract,3d9mad,sportscrazed2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in northern Colorado, but go down to Denver a lot, an hour away.  Would that be considered roaming or is there a coverage map I could check?"

You can try them out for a month and see how you like it. If you're not happy, simply port out to another carrier or back to AT&T.  If you're happy, you could find a group to join or start your own group and save even more money. If you aren't in a group, you could get the basic plan which includes 2.5 GB of high speed than throttled after that with unlimited talk and text for $35/mo with auto pay. That is your final price with taxes/fees etc."

The Xmax+ does also have a 13mp shooter on the back and 8mp on the prime. Of course number of pixels isn't everything, but from having played with both extensively, the pictures on the Xmax+ are noticeably clearer. Now I know you said you wanted a removable battery which the Xmax+ doesn't have. But with a 3200mAh battery, even with heavy use, I'd confidently say it'd get you through the day with out a hiccup. Both phones do support up to 32GBs of SD card storage.

I'm on the 5GB plan and pay $30, so is my mom and my friend. We also have one on the 10GB plan and another on the 2.5GB. The prices can't be beat, at all.   When the 2 redditors joined me I was pretty straight forward: Referrals I own (since they're by account and not phone number) and I've actively try to get referrals so I wouldn't pay out of my own pocket. They were ok with that. I also told them that I would expect payment sometime before the due date and it's worked so far. We now use Square Cash and since the payment takes like no time at all, I can request payment and pay the bill all within 5 minutes.   I also explained that if someone of the group didn't pay by the due date or at least let us know that s/he couldn't pay the bill just yet (just so you know, there's a service from them for $5 that gives you an extra week to pay and can only be used every other month) then I'd ask Cricket to kick them off the group and to be made into their own account. This means that they have to pay going rate for their plan with no savings which would be a $20 hike on price.   The bad thing here is that I could, since I technically own their numbers now, cancel their accounts and leave them without their number. This is something I would never do since I'd hate someone doing it to me. I can't fathom what I'd do if it happened to me. They also need to ask for my personal details if they wish to port out the number (I'd give that out easily, though)  If you're willing to take some risks, it's worth it.

NoContract,3d2q33,lemonl1m3,2,Mon Jul 13 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"For me being in a Cricket group has worked out great. The leader of the group asked for my ebay account so he could verify my trustworthiness, but since I didn't have one I just linked him to my YouTube channel. After he deemed I was trustworthy (which I am), he added me to his group plan and everything has been going smoothly. I'm motivated to pay him so I can keep my sweet deal, and he's motivated to keep me so everyone pays less in the group. I pay him every month by sending him $20 via PayPal, and so far everything has been working beautifully."

NoContract,3d0t88,threeclaws,15,Sun Jul 12 15:58:39 2015 UTC,Well the second newest aint that bad. Most of the time you can get last years model off ebay for like $300.
NoContract,3d0t88,fox4thepeople,8,Sun Jul 12 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"If you upgrade to a new phone each year, it actually isn't that expensive. Say you buy the new iPhone 6 64GB now for $800 (including tax). Then you sell the iPhone 6 and upgrade to the new iPhone right when it comes out. If you can sell your iPhone 6 for around $600, then the cost of buying the new iPhone is only around $200. If you continue to do this each year, you spend about $200/year and you will always have the latest and greatest smartphone. Otherwise you can keep the iPhone 6 and upgrade once every 4 years to spend an average of about $200/year."

NoContract,3d0t88,bingfengqishui,4,Sun Jul 12 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"This may be sort of a non-answer, but personally my experience has been that switching to a prepaid carrier (Verizon->Cricket) has made me lose interest in the high-pricetag options. It just sort of seems like a model that only really works because of the marketing hype machine and a few cognitive fallacies that we tell ourselves to justify purchases.  I picked up a popular budget model when I made that switch thinking that over time I'd warm up to buying a more expensive model based on the monthly savings. But instead I've just become content that my next phone will be a budget model too, because there's not really much about my current experience that I'd be willing to pay an extra $400(or the equivalent baked into a contract) to improve.   Otherwise I'd generally agree with the vibe in a few other comments here that the way to go is just to build your personal budget around the full price if it's definitely a thing that you want to have."
NoContract,3d0t88,GNex1,3,Sun Jul 12 18:09:11 2015 UTC,That is exactly how I'm starting to feel. My brand new flagship phone is not $500 better than my kid's new LG G2 for $200. I'm contemplating breaking my contract & selling my Note 4 to get off Verizon.
NoContract,3d0t88,frickshun,3,Sun Jul 12 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you want. If you want the latest gadget, then your going to have to pay for it through carrier contract or buying the phone. You can save by getting a used phone but if you don't want a used phone then try to get a midrange phone."
NoContract,3d0t88,snickers58,3,Sun Jul 12 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"You don't have to buy the newest as soon as it's released. You can wait a bit and buy one. One option is to buy a lightly used one. Another option is to wait and buy a new unit for last year's model.   Even if you buy it outright, it's still usually cheaper when you factor in how much you save on the plan.  For most people's real needs, you don't have to get the newest or top of the line. Research different models and options to see what fits your needs. There are great phones from $180 and up."
NoContract,3d0t88,my02,3,Sun Jul 12 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"Phones cost at least the same with the big carriers, they just hide that price in monthly bills (and if you don't upgrade as soon as you can you end up paying even more for the phone).  Since you want to upgrade in a year or two, you can use the cost savings on the cheaper monthly bill towards a phone. Just save that amount every month"
NoContract,3d0t88,EShy,2,Sun Jul 12 17:03:53 2015 UTC,Get good at maximizing the sales price of your old phone. I usually wait a couple months after release and buy a barely used phone from Swappa or eBay...usually $150 or $200 savings when you factor in the sales tax difference.
NoContract,3d0t88,ksfarm,2,Sun Jul 12 17:05:03 2015 UTC,My trick is I don't use iPhone anymore. I stick with cheaper Android phones such as Zenfone 2 or Moto E.  My goal is to spend $100 per year on phone. If I buy a $400 phone I will keep it for 4 years and etc.
NoContract,3d0t88,cariusQ,2,Mon Jul 13 01:15:38 2015 UTC,my suggestion is give up the super expensive smartphones..  buy what's on sale at slickdeals.. a moto e or a moto g are perfectly find phones.. as is the galaxy avant without spending the another $400 for a s6.. nicest thing about the cheap smartphones we have today is.. when you break them.. their very cheap to fix/replace

NoContract,3d0t88,nikhmendez,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:18:33 2015 UTC,"All I did was save up. I searched around for deals and got them. For example, Boost Mobile charges $650 plus tax to buy the Galaxy S6 from their website, but Best Buy sells the Boost Mobile Galaxy S6 for $599 plus tax on their website. Living on a border of state helps because I took advantage of doing Best Buy's site to store and shipped it to the other state that had lower sales tax.  I am really looking at this as an investment though. Once a newer, better, phone that insterests me comes out on Boost I am selling the S6 to the highest bidder and pay a more reduced cost toward a newer phone."
NoContract,3d0t88,theonlydiego1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:20:40 2015 UTC,"If you want the latest phone, stick to contracts. But realize, the top of the line phone today will be 18 months old in 18 months. You will still have six months left on 24 month obligation. Invariably, there will likely be an equivalent or slightly better phone for not that much money. Personally, I buy new phones about 1.5-2 years and usually buy a phone that has specs that were maybe state of the art 12 months earlier. I usually try to spend under $200."
NoContract,3d0t88,PrecisionGuidedPost,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways to go around getting inexpensive phones.  The first and easiest is to buy a mid-range phone instead of a flagship phone. You might pay $400 outright, but that's still not $700. Mid-range phones are getting better, but they're not the only way to save money on phones.  The next way to save on phones is to buy used old phones. Phones that aren't brand new, both in terms of condition and age, go for less than new ones.  Refurbished phones are also an option. Cricket offers refurbished phones for discounts. Just know that you might not get the original box or all the accessories that you would get with a new phone.  You can also sell your current phone and put the profits towards a new phone, using any of the methods above. Once you get the cycle of buying and selling your phones started, you can pay only the difference between your new phone's cost and your old phone's resale value to upgrade. If you take good care of phones and use phones that have good resale value, you can reduce that difference to $100 or $200."
NoContract,3d0t88,blaziecat1103,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"Easy; don't. Get a Galaxy or iPhone 4 instead, or a litany of other phones that work very well and have aged just slightly. I've got a Project Fi invite, but I'm not spending $600 on a Nexus 6 to try and save money."
NoContract,3d1k3y,snickers58,2,Sun Jul 12 19:38:46 2015 UTC,Which phone are you looking at in particular? I don't think any sales tax on your phone purchase from Cricket will amount to much. But there are some phones that are better to buy elsewhere.

NoContract,3d1k3y,itwasquiteawhileago,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:53:41 2015 UTC,"How often does Cricket offer free after rebate phones? I thought it was pretty much all the time, but currently they do not offer any FAR smartphones. Eventually I want to hop to Cricket, but I couldn't port directly to them from RW, so I went to AT&T and now with T-Mobile because porting from AT&T to Cricket disqualifies from any free phone offers.  I'm with T-Mobile for at least another two months so I can qualify for my T-Mobile free phone rebate and then unlock it, but was surprised to see Cricket for the first time since I started looking (which was some time last year) didn't have anything FAR.

You'd do much better to just buy an inexpensive phone and prepaid service for two months. Depending on where you go (in the USA) and what your needs are, we/I may make recommendations on what would work best for you.  Edit: It looks like you would have voice (2G) and data service (LTE only where band 4 1700/2100mhz is available) with T-Mobile. The information in your links and what I've found is not very specific about frequency bands to be 100% sure."

T-Mobile's LTE data service should be sufficient within the city and the voice/text 2G service will be available basically everywhere in the area.

It looks like it has similar plans (~$45 per 30 days) and would let me connect multiple devices to it through Wifi.  This way I could use my cellphone or tablet for text/data.  I'd be missing a number, but I could get a Skype Number for relatively cheap also."
NoContract,3d01sk,nullstring,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:44:05 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be a very good value for your purposes, I'd say. You could buy a fairly decent phone for that price. Do you plan to need to use tethering data on other devices while you're in Louisiana? Free WiFi is fairly common in businesses in which you might spend time. Of course, if this device better meets your needs, you should choose what works best.    If you don't care about the outlying LTE coverage, plan to stay in the city, or most of the nearby areas, the T-Mobile 5GB $30 plan could work well for you if you want to use just your device. You may need to resort to using Skype or Google Voice for voice calls if you plan to talk more than 100 minutes. This would be a very convenient solution for you if the limitations are acceptable. The setup would be easy and you would spend a total of $30+tax for each month, including the SIM card itself if you purchase it from Walmart.    There are lots of variables here and many good options. The issue is that your phone does not support 1900Mhz LTE which is in use in some of the neighboring cities. You might look at T-Mobile's coverage map and click on possible destinations to see whether or not these places show up as ""1900mhz"" areas."

Looked to see if those matched your frequencies listed.    It looks to me that you have bands 1, 8, and ??. I can't be sure, but the 1700mhz frequency listed is very ambiguous. There aren't really any 1700mhz LTE bands active in japan (From that list), and so maybe it's band 4 which is an american band?  but just maybe. It;s also possible you have band 19 instead of 8, but 19 is an NTT band.  W-CDMA, you have bands 1 and (8 or 19?). None of these will work in america.

Each member can be on whatever plan they choose, you get $20 off of it each month. The 2.5GB plan becomes $20/mo, the 5GB plan becomes $30/mo. For payment, you can either use the quick pay option on Cricket's site or set up a Paypal or something to pay the account owner. One downside, only the account owner can manage the lines, change plans, check usage, etc.  When you join the group, your own account is cancelled and your line becomes part of their account.

Fast forward some years and now they offer 80% of AT&T service for 30% of the price.

Verizon phones are unlocked, as you said, but they generally only support the bare minimum of non-Verizon radio frequencies (based on what overlaps there are and what functionality is bundled on the chipset). Specifically, the vast majority of phones will only get LTE on Band 4 with other carriers because it's the only one that Verizon overlaps with the GSM carriers for. IIRC, HSPA+(aka 4G) runs on 850Mhz/1900Mhz and it only works if the phone fully supports both.  You can also directly check this kind of thing at http://www.willmyphonework.net, it's pretty reliable.

They also use the Verizon network; however, they include roaming with their service (PagePlus does not). If you're a light user ($12 PP plan), I recommend the $75 annual plan which gives you 2000 minutes and 2000 texts to use within a year, that's $0.019 per minute or text. The advantage is if you use a little more one month, and a little less the next, it doesn't matter because it's available for 12 months. Whenever you run out, just purchase another $75 plan. To compare the PagePlus 12 plan, their minutes and texts are $0.024 each. Additionally, Selectel has a great selection of phones on their website for reasonable prices (some are refurbished). Unlike PagePlus which   My experience with them has been top-notch, I can't recommend them enough!"
NoContract,3cokvy,wilandlane,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the tip. They do have a better selection of phones and their plans price well."
NoContract,3cokvy,binyang,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"Just a remind, if you are on that 75 yearly selectel plan, at end of the year, you refill or not, all minutes will be loss, no roll over on it."
NoContract,3cokvy,crazyk4952,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:42:56 2015 UTC,I've been looking into Selectel Wireless. Do they charge an activation fee?
NoContract,3cokvy,wilandlane,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:05:50 2015 UTC,I actually don't know. I checked their website and found this: http://www.selectelwireless.com/activate/. There is no mention of a fee. I would recommend you try the Online Chat and check for an answer. Please report back if you find anything out!
NoContract,3cokvy,binyang,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"I bought a lg fuel(l34c) straight talk from walmart. It's 3G only and worked on pageplus 12. When I dial 611 from the phone, I reach verizon."
NoContract,3cokvy,Mr_You,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:43:58 2015 UTC,Maybe find a used Verizon Prepaid Moto G on Swappa?  New Verizon Prepaid Moto Gs recently dropped to $0-$25(?) so I would assume prices on the used market have severely dropped or you could convince the seller to sell low.  Unfortunately you'll have to verify that it can be activated on an MVNO.  I believe new unactivated phones require 6 months or a year of service on Verizon Prepaid before being unlocked.  Just a thought.
NoContract,3cokvy,stillzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:20 2015 UTC,Im using a NET10 Moto e on Puppywireless...Its working well for me so far i think if it works on Puppy it should work on selectel or pageplus but don't quote me on that
NoContract,3cokvy,cariusQ,2,Thu Jul 9 17:12:50 2015 UTC,How's service with puppy?
NoContract,3cokvy,stillzy,2,Fri Jul 10 00:23:09 2015 UTC,So far so good...I am on the 3g and I did it through their automated system on mypuppywireless.com.  They are going through a migration to move 3g and 4g customers to their new system...basically its a separate tab when you sign up on mypuppywireless (you have 2 networks to choose from their 4g lte and CDMA network) the only difference is that their 4g lte network allows 3g and 4g customers their CDMA network only allows CDMA devices.  Basically it's all Verizon but whoever they go through for Verizon access is changing so they can allow new lte devices.    I'm impressed so far I have the 29.99 plan for 1GB of data and 750 voice/SMS/MMS and I use the moto e that is meant for net10 but works out of the box on puppy and I could request roaming access but I'm in new England and Verizon wireless is king in my parts.

NoContract,3cokvy,hansCT,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:38:39 2015 UTC,"Page Plus is actually pretty good compared to others. Any Tracfone, Net10 or Straight Talk branded phone that's never been activated.  Here's your Moto E: http://www.ebay.com/itm/131352611790  This one's the same but close to free if you sell the airtime PIN SCD bundles with it: http://www.ebay.com/itm/151480536124  Or any VZW-branded prepaid 3G-only phone that's been on VZW prepaid for 6+ months - check the ESN before bidding."
NoContract,3coxp1,davywastaken,4,Thu Jul 9 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"You can call the carrier. ""Hey, I'm looking to buy a used phone and I wanted to make sure it's not on a payment plan or blacklisted. Here is the MEID/IMEI.""  Most reps will check it and let you know if it's good or not. Hang up and call back if you get a rep that sounds like they don't understand your question or aren't helpful. Or, try the same at a store. I wouldn't buy it in person if the other person didn't want to meet at a store.  There's still some risk as you're taking the rep's word for it and they may or may not have fully checked.  Swappa is pretty good with these things. I believe they have worked out something with the carriers to check the serial numbers before a phone can be listed. At least with buying it from Swappa or similar you have some buyer protection and can file a chargeback or paypal claim."
NoContract,3coxp1,my02,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"I think Swappa only guarantees ""bad ESN"", and any protection is only for a while, the old owner could screw you over a year later.  But it doesn't happen that much."
NoContract,3coxp1,hansCT,2,Fri Jul 10 14:44:48 2015 UTC,Unfortunately you're never completely safe buying used. The original owner could always default on payments or report the device stolen and you're basically screwed.
NoContract,3cleot,somanyquestions51,5,Wed Jul 8 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"For the most part you probably can. Is this for a retiree or someone who is concerned about people calling them long distance?

NoContract,3cleot,bingfengqishui,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"I won't need much in the way of minutes.

NoContract,3cleot,ar3n,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:27:10 2015 UTC,"Phone number/area code is generally determined by where you are when you activate the phone, or what address you put in online. Some carriers will let you pick an area code if you give them a call and ask."
NoContract,3cleot,ar3n,2,Thu Jul 9 17:47:04 2015 UTC,Is this something you could use Google Voice for?
NoContract,3cleot,ar3n,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:50:11 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. I just need to be able to make and receive calls. I want my phone number to be a specific area code.
NoContract,3cleot,ar3n,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:25:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't elaborate enough. Do you have another cell phone that will remain active, or is this going to be your only cell phone? If the former, Google Voice would assign you a phone number in the area code of your choice that would then forward to your current number. You would be able to dial out from any phone by calling your Google voice number, entering your pin, and dialing the number you want to call. The dialing out can be automated on a cell phone you regularly use to make it quicker."
NoContract,3cleot,aguy857,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:09:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have another cell phone that will remain active with a contract through Sprint.

NoContract,3cleot,hansCT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"Can you get access to an unused Sprint phone temporarily? If you create an account with RingPlus's free plan (or Ting's $6/mo plan), you may be able to get a number with the area code you want and port it out to Google Voice ($20 fee). I have some more complicated solutions if you'd like them."

I tethered over 1GB of usage over a weekend without any problems. I do however have a phone with CM11. I am not sure how tmobile would limit tethering to 100mb but CM11 might bypass it.

NoContract,3cj1dr,ruben3232,2,Wed Jul 8 17:23:08 2015 UTC,T-Mobile keeps better track of tethering on iOS so you'd be better off jail breaking and getting TetherMe but try PDANet first. On my current carrier PDANet didn't work but TetherMe did.
NoContract,3cj1dr,bingfengqishui,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:23:18 2015 UTC,iPhone tethering is a no with almost all carriers unless you specifically pay for it.

NoContract,3ci7ju,slashing164,0,Wed Jul 8 03:33:06 2015 UTC,There are no family plans I believe. They have standard rates for each line with discounts on each additional line
NoContract,3ci7ju,fly_eagles_fly,2,Wed Jul 8 03:35:13 2015 UTC,This is not correct. There are family plans.
NoContract,3ci7ju,GNex1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"It's sort of a semantic issue. I think most people would identify ""Family Plan"" with the postpaid models where you have one pool of minutes/texts/data and you add lines to it at cost. It's sort of wrapped up in the concept of having a contract in the first place. When I was last on Verizon it was part of a grandfathered Family Plan package that you couldn't get any more (and the newer ""Share Everything"" family plans would have cost more for the same level of service).  On Cricket you distinctly have individual service plans for each line and you just get a credit to your account that offsets the bill. It's pretty much the same in the end but it's good to be aware of the differences in what you're signing on to."
NoContract,3ci7ju,fly_eagles_fly,2,Wed Jul 8 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"While the pool of minutes/data 'family plan' is something relatively new and I can understand associating that with a family plan, I believe most simply look at a family plan as one bill for multiple lines."
NoContract,3ci7ju,ruben3232,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"I remember 10 years ago minutes and texts were still shared so, it's definitely not a new concept so I would understand if people thought it was all shared pools instead of the way Cricket has it."

I mean, public wifi isn't generally top-of-the-line quality, and it's not like people haven't been able to do this on their own since forever.
