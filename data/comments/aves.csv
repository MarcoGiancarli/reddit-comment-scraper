A&B is really getting me interested in it. Also I don't feel like I want to take drugs while listening to trance as much as I do with electro. I will always have a special place for Dada in my heart as they are the guys who got me into EDM.

I saw Dada in Portland a few days ago, they were awesome but it was too crowded, and a lot of inconsiderate shoving. My girlfriend got elbowed in the face a few times and kicked in the head by crowd surfers. It was so bad to her she said she'd probably never attend another show at that venue"
aves,3e3pll,mjmedstarved,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"Haha, I went to dada and wished I would have gone to A&B.  I made some new friends recently who are heavy into trance and I am digging it."

A trance event may be more your thing rather basscon or whatever high energy event."

I feel like if you're going to mosh, mosh with people who want to, otherwise try to keep everyone else out of it. I've met plenty of hardcore moshers that care about others and protect those that don't want to be indiscriminately elbowed or shoved while having their own fun. Music is for everyone, not just people ""in the scene"""
aves,3e3pll,bigfatguy64,4,Tue Jul 21 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"mosh pits aren't something that consciously start happening, they just happen. Only huge douchebags are going to purposefully shove you if you aren't participating(I hate people like that and I totally agree people like that don't belong at an electronic show of any kind), but don't just stand at the edge of the pit and get upset if someone trips into you or something."

aves,3e3pll,catwaifu,2,Tue Jul 21 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"Which is completely unreasonable viewpoint and I understand that.  But there is a limit.  Saying ""if you don't like it then move away"" is easy to say.  That being said, the group around the whole pit minus a few individuals who were jumping out to rest/get their whits back were very annoyed by the moshing.  I personally love moshing, I grew up listening and going to hardcore shows.  I have taken a fair amount of blows that have knocked the wind out of me or made me see stars.  When I am in that world listening to that music I know first hand that the people on the edges of the pit are there to have fun pushing you back into the pit and act more of a wall to help pick you up.  Some people will purposefully throw themselves at the wall just to do it, which is also fun for most everyone.  However the pit by me at The Voyage was full of extremely inconsiderate moshers, treating it like they were seeing A7X, ATR, Between the buried and me, etc.  Which sucks because they were making a bad time for a lot of people around the pit.  People were getting away from the walls just to be replaced by more people who didn't want to participate."
aves,3e3pll,KindCreations,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:22 2015 UTC,"I get that a lot of people don't like it. I don't always like it. Dada life mosh? That's not mosh music IMO.  I remember a few years ago. People weren't moshing but the pit would get rowdy. People didn't bitch about it so much like they do today.  People go to get fucked up, listen to dope ass music, and party. Idk when the fuck that changed? As this scene gets more popular there's just too many different types of people to please."
aves,3e3pll,steezyneezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"I guess then it could be the event coordinators who are to blame?  Having music genres that are so far and wide to bring electro house, dubstep, and trap together in one place may not be the best in the future.  The cultures are fairly different in how the audience experiences them.  It seems that you and I enjoy different genres of music, you get frustrated when people do X and I get frustrated when people do Y.  Who knows...Not I.  As far as the moshing, I don't recall any during Dada's set.  It was more around 12th Planet.  I was really looking forward to seeing Andybody as I had only heard a hand full of his/her(their?) songs, but traffic made that impossible.  I mainly wanted to see the duke nukem song."
aves,3e3pll,KludogVG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'd hate to see the scene segregated like that. I love that there's trap only events, or trance only events. Those are great. But I love many different styles and I know a lot of others who do too. It's nice to go out to a show and have some variety. Sometimes that doesn't mesh well. I don't think it's the fault of promoters.  I think the fault lies with overall general respect. People are going to enjoy themselves at shows. What I always see nowadays is people tend to bitch more after the fact. It's quite passive-aggressive. If you have a problem with someone around you, tell them. I've done this many times, ""Hey man you just hit my girl, can you watch out?"" That stuff goes along way. I've been on both ends of that, I bumped someone, they ask me to chill, or vice versa. Or if I can't see, I've asked people to take down the totem, or once this tall ass guy was just like, ""hey do you wanna get on my shoulders?"" after I asked him if I he could move to the left a tad. Ravers are kind spirited and trying to have fun. I always see complaining on the internet but I never see anyone actually try and do anything productive about their complaints during the show. ""What can I do?"" Just confront the person causing your issue.   I've noticed a shift in the overall attitude of raves. I remember in like 2010/2011, you could go, meet a nice girl, dance the night away. Depending on the artist, headbang, go insane, maybe mosh a little with a small group. I think attitudes have shifted with concert goers, and it has a lot to do with this anti-PLUR mindset some people have.  This is a throwback photo I always found hilarious but true. If you're gonna be right up around the front, maybe not front row, but either left or right just inside the speaker stack, but maybe 5-15 rows into the crowd, shit is gonna be hype and potential mosh pit will ensue. https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11385524_913371105394053_543760888_n.jpg"
aves,3e3pll,ShizTheresABear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel you on the segregation aspect.  It would make for smaller audiences at the shows.  Maybe it would drive a higher demand for EDC type festivals with multiple stages?  I am not familiar with the econ of event promotion.  I haven't been in the scene long.  Last years EDC was actually my first rave.  The amount of love I received from everyone was unreal.  I was completely blown away by it.  I went to a few shows here and there in the LA and SF areas and had very similar experiences.  Once I started seeing more trap being played at the shows the vibe changed for me completely.  I noticed more people who were at the shows to a) get shitfaced b)find a girl to fuck and c)not necessarily cause problems but inadvertently causing problems.  I ran into a guy at EDC this year who was telling me how he was so pissed off he bought a VIP wristband for EDC and how ""All the girls dress like sluts but none of them want to fuck me"".  Not to mention the number of straight up fights I saw this year.  The anti-PLUR/PLUR ends at the parking lot attitude is strange to me.  This culture changed the way I live my life.  I try to help everyone I possibly can.  Person on the side of the road with a flat, help them out.  Someone is short a few bucks at starbucks, spot them.  I never would have done that prior to going to EDC.  Helping people have a good time inside or out is something that is extremely fun for me!  lol ""too old for this shit spot""  That graphic is perfect."
aves,3e3pll,DARKpandaMAGIC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:20 2015 UTC,"I agree my friend. The trappier styles do draw different crowds. You get the bros who want to just hook up with some hot chicks. The mainstream has brought this on. People have caught on that this shit is fun as hell. But also we have less of the local/underground scenes in many places because of the Govt and also because it's too expensive nowadays with the asking price for these artists. You need to find the more authentic festivals/raves. Try going to a wonderland event hosted by Insomniac. Escape, Beyond, Nocturnal. You'll see more of that atmosphere like you first got with EDC. It really depends on the event, the area, and the artist, but generally there's just a lot of people at these things who aren't ravers, they don't even pretend, they just straight up act like imbeciles and cause problems."

I got a bloody nose and my girlfriends hip piercing was almost torn out and her industrial bar too. Dillon Francis was great but a crowd like that tainted the experience heavily.

Its not that hard to avoid if you don't like it. I've gone to alot of garage shows so I'm used to it but it's understandable if you don't like it.

aves,3e13wx,CampbellsExtraChunky,2,Tue Jul 21 03:46:09 2015 UTC,i haven't been to a skills party in 10 years but when i did they always had top notch production. i dont know about oracle as a rave venue though.
aves,3e13wx,madmorph,2,Tue Jul 21 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and Oakland and their 2:00am cutoff or something. Kinda early imo."
aves,3e13wx,madmorph,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:38 2015 UTC,Lol I think beyond at shoreline ends at midnight?
aves,3e13wx,ChocolateMilkAddict,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"Not even midnight, last year it ended at 11 on Saturday and 10 on Sunday because noise complaints :/. They make up for it I guess by starting at 1 but then there's really only like 4 hours of good darkness where all the lights can be seen. SoCal was 4-2am, that's a pretty festival time imo."
aves,3e13wx,aldernon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:10 2015 UTC,"Went to Pop NYE / Pop the Dream, no real complains other than the early cutoff. I'm probably going to ETD- overall, I've had good times with skills so far so I figure might as well keep trying them.  Pop NYE had a neat stage in the middle of the court that rotated which was pretty cool whereas Pop the Dream was on one of the sides with a traditional stage- I'm expecting the traditional stage approach for ETD.  Lineup is solid though, it should be a fun show."
aves,3e13wx,jackpaxx,3,Tue Jul 21 04:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, a traditional stage will be used for ETD. They said no 360 stage this year so there won't be one used for NYE either."
aves,3e13wx,aldernon,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"Great news. Thanks!  I saw another post regarding ETD love and everyone was bashing on it cause of the name, and the event not actually being techno, and it kinda worried me."
aves,3e13wx,GarrulousBastard,3,Tue Jul 21 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that too.  Bottom line, there's a lot of people out there who are jaded with what they're typically exposed to- I got the impression a lot of people in that thread fell into that crowd. Even at the events I was at, I saw / heard a few people grumbling during certain acts- whereas I was enjoying those acts and not enjoying others as much.  Bottom line, it is what you let it be. So long as you're open minded and out to have a good time, I can't see you running into issues- but I'd also make sure you want to see at least one of the artists. ETD's lineup looks diverse enough that that probably isn't a problem."
aves,3e13wx,jackpaxx,2,Tue Jul 21 04:20:38 2015 UTC,"I prefer Skills' single stage style compared to the multiple stages approach that most other festivals take these days. As far as production goes, I haven't been disappointed with them yet. Sure, it's not technically techno, but the lineup looks solid."
aves,3e13wx,night28,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"Recently Skills' line-ups haven't been as good as they can be but their production is honestly probably one of the best in the Bay imo. A lot of people hate the Oracle as a venue for an event but I actually love it and have had fairly positive experiences there (with the exception of one incident where a security guard tried to make me throw away my asthma inhaler). Their laser production is honestly pretty top notch and is probably one of my favorites. They were really good at Pop 2015 and will apparently be even better at ETD.   As for the event itself, I'm not crazy about the line-up but I love the idea of an all trance event and I have been wanting to see all of the artists that were booked for this event so I'm pretty excited."
aves,3e13wx,aldernon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going this year! I haven't been to it either, but my friend has and he's liked the past years. I also went to Pop this year and it wasn't very good. I'm hoping ETD will be different. Not a big fan of the venue, and I had lower level tickets at Pop. I got floor tickets this time around so I'm hopeful that it'll be a lot better. I like the lineup so I know I'm going to have a good time regardless."
aves,3e13wx,night28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:35:05 2015 UTC,"How were the lower level seats? I've gone floor to all events I've gone to, just curious- seems like it would kill the vibe and get weird sound?"
aves,3e13wx,aldernon,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"Sound was still good actually and the lasers were still really cool. You could still easily feel the bass. They do a really good job with production. I didn't like the lower level seats because it makes dancing hard due to all of the chairs. It was annoying being limited by the chairs and there was less hype although that could just be attributed to Pop the dream not being all that great in general this year. One good thing, ironically, is that it's nice to have the chairs to sit on when you get overwhelmed or tired. The tickets are for lower/floor so that is good anyways."
aves,3e13wx,night28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can feel that.  Going Chuckie to Gareth Emery to Aoki felt like a mistake to me- overall it just felt slightly off.  Ah well, here's to hoping ETD shows up and doesn't have hour long lines!"

aves,3dzjcj,GGTaylorSS,2,Tue Jul 21 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"If you are under 18 there ARE but their existence is limited. If you are under 16 I doubt it unless you can find some underground ones and don't look like a little kid.  Regarding your question about safety, safety is relative. Generally larger, more public events will have MORE security and personnel walking around, so could be considered more safe, but the tradeoff with these is vastly larger number of people which inherently increases risk, though if it is a large one that allows 16+ I would bet their emphasis on safety is even stronger, as they are allowing a large number of minors on their premises. On the other hand, the smaller, more underground raves are going to have less stringent security requirements (i.e. more drug use, less security, etc) and might be considered ""less"" safe.. again safety is relative.  EDIT: I was speaking specifically about the rave scene in the US, but most of the above should apply in Canada also. I am just not familiar enough with the scene to be able to say for certain."
aves,3dzjcj,n1ll0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:29 2015 UTC,14 but Ive had people mistake me for 16/17. No doubt by 16 Ill be looking 18 XP. Safety is also relevant because my mom is... a mom and cares if I'm around a bad crowd. I could care less if people are wired as long as they're not pushy or disrespectful.

You'll get to watch rave culture grow and expand from the outside, and when you can finally start going to them you'll love it. If I were you and simply could not wait I'd try to get a fake 18 ID in a year or 2 just because it's definitely worth it. That way when you start going to them legally you'll already have enough experience under your belt. Is the event you went to at anime expo? I heard Porter Robinson was there."

aves,3dzjcj,oxyhydrozolpidone,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:04 2015 UTC,"How old are you? There's a lot of 16+ festivals. And when I've gone, there's been quite a few younger people. They barely ID'd.  And it's gonna be a rave. There's gonna be drugs, alcohol, etc. I'm not sure how old you are, but be careful if you're younger. There's a good reason for age limits.   Find some all ages events in your area, you won't be getting the premium festivals, but they'll likely have for the most part underage people, and be a safer environment. I personally stay away from them because I personally don't like raving with a bunch of kids, no offense.   Best advice would be to get a group of friends you trust, and go to some all ages stuff with them."
aves,3dzjcj,U4EADonovan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"I'm 14. Also, at the rave I was at it was late at a convention. I also get the not wanting to rave with a bunch of kids. Completely makes sense to me, I know more people my age than I could count on two hands that are pretty immature and such. Also, I was alone when I went to the room with the rave. Wasn't really that bad. I seemed to fit in decently. Although I don't know how I'd do in a larger, more real setting."
aves,3dzjcj,U4EADonovan,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, I can give you some advice.   I avoid events that aren't 18+ for the most part, unless the lineup is crazy good, which isn't often. 16+ events are basically all ages, the ones I've been to didn't ID, and had tons of people under 16. I avoid those too now, because frankly, I'm in college, 21, and I go to raves to have fun, and not worry about anything other than that. That changes when everyone around me is underage, it's much less of a PLUR environment, I can chalk that up to inexperience. But lets say I'm rolling, I want to be around people that are at least 18, and didn't get dropped off by their mom. I've been at a 16+ event, some girl in pasties was rolling, started trying to hit on me, looked my age, but when I asked she was 15. Noped the fuck out to another side of the crowd and found an older group after that.   However, I myself went to my first festival when I was 15. I started going to parties, drinking, and doing drugs at 14. That's not a good thing. But, I was rather experienced and never really got phased by seeing fights, drugs, etc. I also...never told anyone my real age, always that I was at least 19. I also acted that age, and had to, all of my friends that were there actually were that age. At 14, I'd suggest going to some all ages events, just google ""all ages raves/concerts/festivals in whatever state you live in"". You can get into 16+ events if you want to tbh, but realize that they're less tame. Bottom line is no matter where you go, there will probably be the occasional drunk asshole. If you're not ready for that, that's fine, you're still young, and look for small safer stuff.   Honestly, even with fake ID's and trying to sneak into events, I wasn't able to go to much until I was out of high school and over 18. I dreamed about going to EDC for 5 years before I could finally go. You'll have to look forward to a lot, and enjoy the most of what you can go to. But 18 comes faster than you think, and 16 will be just around the corner."
aves,3dzjcj,theycallmekenny,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"Jesus christ dude. Teenagers are some fucked up people occasionally XD. Drunks don't phase me too much, fights are eh, drugs, whatever they're having fun! Also, although I'm 14 I believe I can get and even had the mindset of PLUR pretty well my first time which is nice I'd think. Thank you very much for the info man. I'll be looking forward to turning 18 and getting a passport even for the 16+ stuff. Question though, why would you have to worry about anything else but having fun in a 16+ rave? Are some or most kids that go pricks or shitstarters? Or is it simply you'd rather be somewhere with more people your age? Sorry if I'm asking a bunch of questions I'm just curious to get more about the culture and such. My passion is strong but my knowledge is weak basically! XD"
aves,3dzjcj,blackbeltnerd,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I'm asking a bunch of questions I'm just curious to get more about the culture and such. My passion is strong but my knowledge is weak basically! XD   Hey man, I was there too once. I'm always happy to help new people get into the scene, you can ask as much as you want, and PM me if you want if you have questions in the future. I'd be glad to help.    Drunks don't phase me too much, fights are eh, drugs, whatever they're having fun!   I do wanna give some input here, you are young. Walk away from bad situations, as they can get very bad. If you get a bad vibe from someone, get away from them. If some dude is stupidly fucked up and acting odd towards you, get away. Trust your gut instinct. 99% of people I've met at raves are amazing, but all it takes is that one person for something bad to happen.   Fights that happen aren't like what you see at school, they're people actually trying to hurt each other. It doesn't matter what a guy says to you, what they say about your girlfriend, or what they say about your mother, get the fuck away from fights. Also, if you see a fight happening, go grab a bouncer, don't stand around next to it, or at the very least, get away from it. You're too young to break it up yourself, and you never know what will happen, I've been at an underground rave where some dude tried to pull a gun during a fight.  Basically, be careful. I'm not trying to scare you or anything, maybe 1 in 10 raves I go to have a punch thrown, and by then it's already broken up. The only seen 2 serious fights at raves, and they were both at underground places, not events they'd let anyone under 18 go to. It's just your young, you've gotta be careful. It's just a precaution, because in all likelihood, the people you meet at raves are the friendliest group of people you'll ever meet. If something weird is happening, yeah, get away from it, but go in, feel the music, be happy, and meet some amazing people.  Also, you're 14, don't be a dumbass like me and get into hard drugs too early. But that's another conversation.    Question though, why would you have to worry about anything else but having fun in a 16+ rave? Are some or most kids that go pricks or shitstarters? Or is it simply you'd rather be somewhere with more people your age?   They're just kids, and are young. You have to remember, at 16+ events, there's lots of people under 16 as well. I'm social as fuck at raves, and also tend to do drugs/drink. It just straight up feels weird letting loose around a bunch of kids that young. And let's be honest, you start to get old man syndrome. I have no problems with people underage being at raves, so long as they're responsible. I mean, it's what I did. And let's be honest, most people aren't gonna make a post /r/aves asking questions about it. They're just gonna jump in, and either treat it like another party, or take too many drugs and become a news headline of ""16 year old dies at EDC"" and get it shut down. But mostly, I just prefer to be around older people, as I have more in common with them. Age doesn't guarantee maturity however, I know quite a few people in their 20s that I feel the same way about underage kids at raves, and very few kids not 18 yet that have the maturity that I forget they're not an adult.   Sorry for the long answers, I'm drinking and on some adderall right now.    EDIT That I forgot   A good rave is magical, there's nothing like it. I know I was negative in places above, but seriously, the best advice I can give you is how perfect if feels to just be completely happy, feeling the music, with a packed room of people around you feeling the same way."

I guess the reason this kind of comment pisses me off is because people clearly have no idea what they're talking about if they're going to say that something is obvious when they're actually incorrect to begin with.   Also, the first few tracks that he's been dropping in his sets are tracks I've never heard anybody else use. I can understand saying some tracks are played out (Turn Down for What and Get Low are the absolutely the worst right now) but if somebody can show me somebody else dropping that Lunatic remix or that Borgore ID then I will be forever grateful because I'd love to hear somebody other than DJ Snake use it."

aves,3dzl31,Cheesus85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"Seen him twice at Crush in AZ 2014 and HARD Summer 2014, relentless bangers and a fun show. Hearing ""You Know You Like It"" with so many other people is magical"

aves,3dzl31,rachchi,0,Mon Jul 20 21:10:11 2015 UTC,He killed it at Coachella
aves,3dzl31,s0ysauce09,0,Tue Jul 21 01:44:29 2015 UTC,He was one of my top 10 at coachella especially with the guest he brought out
aves,3dyb1e,InYourGirlsGuts,5,Mon Jul 20 15:03:51 2015 UTC,"Benny's set was awesome and Tiesto owned the place as usual.  I was really unimpressed with how quiet it was, did anyone else notice that?  Must be a new ordinance in Morrison or something.  How about the blue mitsubishi lancer taking out cars and people sprinting down the hill?  Just saw the dude leaving in metal bracelets after he almost hit us!"
aves,3dyb1e,Mr_FLuiD,8,Mon Jul 20 15:54:18 2015 UTC,There's like some sound regulations on red rocks now. The people around the venue were complaining about how loud the shows were so they have to keep them quieter now. Stupid IMO. If it bothers you so much then don't move near a damn outdoor amphitheater.
aves,3dyb1e,underrager,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:06 2015 UTC,That same argument is what's being used to shut down some of the definitive clubs in the UK.
aves,3dyb1e,Sofiztikated,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:38 2015 UTC,How are they shutting down indoor clubs. I mean indoor venues aren't as loud as outdoor venues so how can they even argue that. Ridiculous.

aves,3dyb1e,yayblah,4,Mon Jul 20 15:13:11 2015 UTC,What made Tiesto good? His recent sets have been pretty uninspiring
aves,3dyb1e,T-157,4,Mon Jul 20 18:35:05 2015 UTC,He actually played trance his time.
aves,3dyb1e,yayblah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:00 2015 UTC,"Like, a lot of trance? or what"
aves,3dyb1e,originaljk_47,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"He played like 5 trance songs. I thought his set was good, but he left alot on the tables. His visuals were really good production but are super random and make no sense. I know you are thinking, ""what? They're visuals they are all random."" not so. He had alot of girls doing wierd stuff (kinda felt like creepy unkle tiesto) and the same visual spanned like 3 songs, even if one song was fast then the next slow. That and he under used the lazers man!"
aves,3dyb1e,Phyrexian_Starengine,8,Tue Jul 21 05:03:27 2015 UTC,Benny actually played a good set?  Color me impressed.
aves,3dyb1e,RyanIsFlyin,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"My top sets were definitely Flosstradamus, Datsik, Above & Beyond"
aves,3dyb1e,icantdrive,2,Wed Jul 22 01:05:38 2015 UTC,How was the venue? Did anyone travel from out of state and was it worth it?
aves,3dyb1e,motecizuma,9,Mon Jul 20 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"How was the venue? Son, this is Red Rocks. We're talking about the Temple of Bassnectar here. Red Rocks is always considered one of the best venues in the world, and there are always people who travel both domestically and internationally to see a show at Red Rocks. Every show is always 💯"
aves,3dyb1e,thirdegree,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:55 2015 UTC,Red rocks is one of the top 10 reasons I'd live in boulder over Bay Area if I have the choice.
aves,3dyb1e,icantdrive,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:44 2015 UTC,I guess I'm traveling there soon!
aves,3dyb1e,ReflexEight,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"I think Red Rocks is ok, not worth the price most tickets are worth."
aves,3dyb1e,KindCreations,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:55 2015 UTC,I mean I paid 150$ for 3 nights of Sweet Sweet Nectar. Most paid more than that but I flew in for it and it was worth every cent. Idk how much Norma tickets run. I think Lorin just likes to make it as affordable as possible.
aves,3dyb1e,ReflexEight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:34 2015 UTC,It's just not the first places I would pick to see an EDM DJ.
aves,3dyb1e,KindCreations,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"Why not? Sound is amazing top to bottom, view is great. I will say it is hard as fuck to get around. That's my only qualm with RR. I guess some shows might not have the best sound. Really depends on the artist/promoter."
aves,3dyb1e,ReflexEight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"Of all the times I've been there the sound was OK at best. The view is alright, I would rather have a whole view of nature rather than a city in front of me. Navigation is a huge pain. A ticket to a standard show there costs as much as some of the biggest events in Denver."
aves,3dyb1e,KindCreations,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"Well I'm from AZ and honestly seeing people here can run 25-40 bucks for a small venue. And that's for a mediocre lineups with one ""headliner"" sometimes if there's multiple names it's 50-75 for an event not even near that size. So $50 a night seems fine to me.  And I will say while red rocks is amazing. The Gorge is the best venue in the U.S. The sound was just alright but the view and the weather in June was bar none. They could probably go louder, they just didn't have the best setup compared to guys like Bassnectar and Tipper putting on their own events. I did see Bassnectar at Paradiso (the gorge) and it was great (still not his own event tho), I liked him better at RR but performer aside, the gorge takes it."
aves,3dyb1e,originaljk_47,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"I can't beleive the blasphemy I'm reading....not one mention of kaskade! He had one of the best sets I have ever seen live, by far best set of the festival! 3lau crushed it before him with suprise special guest bright lights. Mako was amazing, even on the smallest second stage I had ever seen. Sevenlions crushed and above&beyond brought the hammer with some of their most ageessive feels! >Blew my mind."
aves,3dyb1e,blackreddit,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"i only went friday and enjoyed the main stage, the other two were have technical problems. 7 lions set was dope.  Flostradamus played good songs just talked away too much. and Above & Beyond was sexy like always. i only wish i saw more single women...."
aves,3dyb1e,phazing_49ers,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:23 2015 UTC,Yea floss had a great set but he would interrupt the music like every 5 minutes to yell* into the mic
aves,3dyb1e,blackreddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"i know, by the end it was like ""shut up dude either play or bring out A&B"" didn't think he was going with bitch better have money, everyone near me was like  ""woooow really floss? """
aves,3dyb1e,chops228,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:11 2015 UTC,"Friday and Saturday were pretty fun. My favorite sets were definitely Seven Lions and Terravita. I wasn't a fun of Sunday though; not that they were bad shows, that just wasn't my style of music."
aves,3dyb1e,JackRabbit7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:41 2015 UTC,It was a good show. I do hate how quiet it is now it's not the same experience when the bass isn't pounding your body more while i'm feeling good. I know Martin Garrix was announced on Friday night but I heard they made another announcement when I was leaving last night but I was already headed down the stairs and didn't hear it. What was the announcement after Testio did anyone hear it?
aves,3dyb1e,JackRabbit7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:00 2015 UTC,Flostradamus playing for 420.

aves,3duzkj,Cancer_Jesus,8,Sun Jul 19 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, even Oceanlab / A&B would be pretty cool. It would definitely be a classics / throwback set, which would be just as special as a Tiesto throwback set."
aves,3duzkj,Trancefam,4,Sun Jul 19 21:28:05 2015 UTC,Anjunabeats throwback set would be pretty nuts.
aves,3duzkj,Scottstimo,4,Mon Jul 20 00:16:58 2015 UTC,I've been waiting for an announcement for a special Tiesto trance set.
aves,3duzkj,xtremeschemes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"That's all I want, I feel like he would deliver too."
aves,3duzkj,kingtucker10,5,Sun Jul 19 21:17:26 2015 UTC,I'm not getting too excited since I'm still thinking it won't be him. But if I'm Pasquale and I'm trying to get this first year festival some attention I'm getting Tiesto on the phone and asking him to do me a favor and do a trance only / throwback set.   I don't even care if he goes right back to big room House the day after his performance. He can still do big room House while throwing in a trance only set at least this once.
aves,3duzkj,Trancefam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:37 2015 UTC,"For sure because he doesn't need to cater to broad crowd expectations, which if I recall correctly is the reason he left the trance scene to begin with."
aves,3duzkj,xtremeschemes,2,Sun Jul 19 21:21:37 2015 UTC,All about the $$$. :(
aves,3duzkj,kingtucker10,2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think he realized there was going to be a shift in the industry. I think Kaleidoscope was his first album that deviated from trance. To his credit, he made the move before the big EDM boom that started with Guetta / Harris. I guess for a man like Tiesto, someone who had been the face of electronic music for a long time, he had to change with the times if he was going to avoid disappearing.   I'll always be a Tiesto fan regardless of whether he's doing trance, big room house, etc. He was one of a handful of DJs that kept electronic music relevant and interesting before electronic music turned into ""EDM.""   But I would still love to hear Suburban Train, Dallas 4 PM, Love Comes Again, etc."
aves,3duzkj,Trancefam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:28 2015 UTC,I have a feeling it may be about the times because if they have 10 DJs over 10 hours it didn't allow for long sets. Hopefully they stay open late.
