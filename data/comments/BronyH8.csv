BronyH8,3cw1ff,jayyhi,0,Sat Jul 11 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but they had nothing of substance to add to the discussion. They nitpicked through a little bit of my wording and then told me to explain it to /r/cringeanarchy and /r/justneckbeardthings. Like, bruh, did you comprehend any of my post? For example, the important part where I described that it's a form of satire? They don't understand that those subs are doing precisely what I described. And the only reason they understand the humor here now is because I took time to spell it out. This whole discussion gave me AIDS tbh."

I do that on worthy posts, because I tend to skip parts unworthy of my attention.  It's a way to say ""thank you"" to me. To be respectful.  It's when I drop one liners or at the opposite extreme walls of text not adressed specifically you should worry of the content of my post. =)  And I've been well-behaved : I don't linked any pony gif.

I spent several paragraphs explaining why you shouldn't take this sub seriously, and in return I received massive blocks of text picking through my wording, telling me why the sub wasn't funny, and why bronies aren't that bad.   You guys still don't understand the humor here. To be fair, we should ban you for infringing upon rule 6, but I will abstain for the time being. I don't even care that you're a brony, this is a cringe sub. Either join in on the joke or gtfo."

Hehe quite understandable from us. But you didn't cared trying to prouve us wrong.  I've seen an atheist with a huge image with hudeads of things showing stupid thing did in sake of faith.   Why there is nobody here doing the same thing ?   You guys still don't understand the humor here.   I try. But I'm picky. I love ironic humor. I thought it could be a nice place for that.   To be fair, we should ban you for infringing upon rule 6, but I will abstain for the time being   Not rule one ? =O   I don't even care that you're a brony, this is a cringe sub. Either join in on the joke or gtfo.   I joined. I don't want to insult your intelligence in showing all the quotes I say I adhered of the humor of this sub, because I honestly think you already  know that.

BronyH8,36jvzy,sourcaliflower,-1,Tue May 19 22:43:18 2015 UTC,"Current brony here.  It's overrated. What a lot of bronies forget is that even the show's damn good for a kids' show, it's still a kids' show. It isn't dark, it ain't exactly the most mature thing out there and while there are a couple episodes that really take a look at the characters and develop them and all that, for the most part it's pretty much just a typical show for little girls. Especially S3.   I mean the show isn't necessarily bad; it's just that a lot of bronies hype it up as the best thing ever, which it really isn't. Is it a nice break from the fairly dark shows that are popular now? Yes. Is it a great show? No.   Oh, except for the comics. They're a lot more mature than the show and are actually pretty funny."
BronyH8,36jvzy,DarkLordSnuffles,0,Tue May 19 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest, the show really isn't that dark. We have grimdark fanfics for that. Most of the bronies actually praise it for not having ""Mary Sue"" styled perfect characters, and actually presenting an interesting cast with real problems."
BronyH8,36jvzy,MCAsomm,-1,Wed Jun 3 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who likes the show, I think I should point out that it's not really worth the effort to criticize a show made for little girls for being for little girls. Of course it's not that great of a show. Of course it's not really going to have truly sophisticated writing. Sure, you could write something about how some bronies are delusional, but I think people generally know that. It is not hard to argue that the show has obvious flaws, so I don't really see the point in doing so.  All this being said, the Season 5 premiere was overtly anti-Marxism and Orwellian, so I wouldn't say the show never delves into darker themes. But it will always sugar coat them of course."
BronyH8,36jvzy,rbloyalty,1 point,Wed May 20 10:22:40 2015 UTC,"No I didn't mean criticizing the show for being for little girls, just pointing out that it indeed is for little girls to show how silly it is to praise it like a next coming of Christ. You know, like when bronies say how mature it is because a pony cried when her friends hurt her feelings, it would bring up some other children's show where someone's father dies as an example of how overreacting and easily impressed bronies are."
BronyH8,36jvzy,MCAsomm,1 point,Wed May 20 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you. The show is fresh and light years ahead of almost any children cartoon we know (and some adult TV series too), but it doesn't deserve that much praise as some bronies are giving it."
BronyH8,36eszi,Billy_droptables,3,Mon May 18 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing I've noticed watching groups like this, its ""Hate is a VERY weak adhesive."" Hate, anger, saltiness, all those good emotions, seem to fail really quickly. Favorite team just lose? you'll be over it in a few weeks. Game you were looking forward to flopped? Eh, you'll be looking at a new game next month with the same enthusiasm.  Meanwhile, people who love their teams/games, will be there through every victory and defeat. There are people who pay quite a bit of money to keep their favorite iteration of World of Warcraft alive for the other people who enjoy that version. Do you think someone who hated WoW would go through the same level of effort to bash on the game? Maybe for a while, but then someone would mention how justin bieber was caught smoking weed, and then they'll focus on that for a while, and forget about WoW."
BronyH8,36eszi,thetracker3,1 point,Tue May 19 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"I may or may not have be involved with the previous hate group in a big way.  The reason things died down was 1) There was a small group of really dedicated haters that got permabanned/torn apart by the events that occurred. Some of them were wonderfully despicable individuals and you need people like that working together to make things happen. And 2) The whole Brony thing is dying at this point. They're not significant enough to even bother acknowledging.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be a good thing if a group here rose again. You've got to post on the autist pedo subreddits and get them pissed off. Not raiding, but screencapturing your interactions with them. That get's other subs talking and adds subcribers and then you're in great shape."
BronyH8,36eszi,FV55555,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"Bronies are nowhere as loud and active as they used to be few years ago so the demand for hating them is proportionally lower. I remember how back in 2012 they would embarass themselves on a daily basis, there would always be some cringe brony video or some drama caused by some bigoted brony's comments. Back then there were tons of blogs, deviantart groups or subreddits dedicated to documenting all that brony cringe. Good times, good times."

You’d have to be mentally ill to see Bronies as anything other than loser weirdo fag loser nerd perverts. However, after watching My Little Pony, talking to their fans, and checking out the documentary Bronies, the truth hit me like an atomic wedgie. This isn’t about wimps such as Pajama Boy or those disgusting perverted Furries. It’s about autistic men trying to overcome their largest impairment: social interaction. Once you figure that out, making fun of them becomes equivalent to going up to a cancer patient on the dance floor, ripping off her wig, and yelling, “HA HA YOU’RE BALD!”"

BronyH8,2c5f6a,JIVEprinting,5,Wed Jul 30 15:58:31 2014 UTC,"Let me get this straight. You insulted someone and told them to kill yourself, and then insulted an admin while insisting that you get unbanned... and you're surprised at this outcome?"
BronyH8,2c5f6a,Wharlagana,3,Wed Aug 6 00:09:26 2014 UTC,I don't know anything about that. I simply found the picture and posted it
BronyH8,2c5f6a,Sansgendered,2,Wed Aug 6 00:59:56 2014 UTC,"Yes, because everyone knows that freedom of speech is outlawed in the internet."
BronyH8,2c5f6a,RabidRaccoon,5,Wed Jul 30 17:45:39 2014 UTC,"Well, I mean, that's sort of a thing with mods. It's not like you have posting rights."

BronyH8,28qhvm,osm70,3,Sat Jun 21 17:58:53 2014 UTC,I think that he's being suspiciously defensive.

Also, saying that it's only possible for half the brony population to be pedophiles doesn't exactly help his case."
BronyH8,28qhvm,RamenTensei,1 point,Sun Jun 22 10:12:39 2014 UTC,"I think it's a strawman.  brony #1 misrepresents antibrony arguments  brony #2 tries to refute brony #1's staged argument  heck, they should put this in highschool textbooks, it's a perfect two-man example of one."
