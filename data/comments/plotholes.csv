But also, there's a fan theory that Hammond lied about the origins of the dinosaurs (just as he lied that they were all hatched on the island in the first movie). It's more likely they reverse engineered them from living modern animals, selectively de-evolved them to resemble their ancestors. That would also explain certain inaccuracies in the dinosaurs like size differences, lack of feathers, poison spit and neck fans, etc. They weren't resurrected, they were designed to meet the public's expectation. The strongest evidence for this theory is that extinct plants were brought back too. How, if they used mosquito blood to resurrect dinosaurs, did they use that same blood to resurrect extinct plants?

plotholes,3e1evv,Randomwordcombo,4,Tue Jul 21 07:44:56 2015 UTC,"There was a great except from a Cracked article about this very thing, just the other day:   The ""dinosaurs"" John Hammond, Samuel L. Jackson, and the bad guy from The Substitute 2 created weren't resurrected from ancient dino DNA -- they were actually brand new creatures cobbled together using DNA from non-extinct contemporary animals.  The whole ""dinosaurs back from extinction!"" thing was just a P.T. Barnum-esque stunt to fool gullible tourists.  Why It's Not That Crazy:  The originator of this theory appears to be Redditor Brownra04, as far as we can track it down, and it goes like this: The entire premise of Jurassic Park centers around the idea that geneticists were able to extract dinosaur DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in fossilized chunks of tree sap, which is impossible, because DNA has a half-life and would have decayed beyond any possible use after 65 million years. Plus, there's no way you would find a mosquito who limited its blood intake to one particular species of dinosaur. There would be hundreds, if not thousands, of different DNA strands in each mosquito. Every DNA extraction would be like taking a cotton swab of a college freshman's bedsheets.  So, the only way for Jurassic Park to get its hands on any dinosaurs would be to have their geneticists build them from scratch, which would explain why all the dinosaurs in the movie look like how we, the ignorant public, imagine dinosaurs look, as opposed to how they actually appeared in nature. For instance, in real life, a velociraptor was the size of a chimpanzee, whereas in Jurassic Park, velociraptors are large enough to play professional basketball. Also, they had feathers. Most dinosaurs probably had feathers.  And the dilophosaurus, the tiny, spitting monster with a technicolor neck frill, was 10 feet tall, and the fossil record provides zero evidence of poison loogies or flashy throat accessories.  We also know that the park's founder, John Hammond, built his fortune on selling people false realities: He gives an entire speech about how he started his career with a motorized flea circus designed to trick small children. In The Lost World, we learn that the lab where we saw the baby raptor hatchling in the first film was just a show for the tourists -- the majority of dinosaur hatching took place on an entirely different island, despite Hammond insisting to his guests that he had been present for every single birth. Furthermore, at one point Dr. Sattler notices that Jurassic Park is covered in extinct species of plants.  You can't clone a plant from mosquitoes encased in amber, so how the hell did they get there? The only explanation is that the plants are a complete genetic facsimile. Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, and Dr. Malcolm weren't brought to the park to determine whether or not it was safe for visitors -- they were brought to the park to determine whether or not it would be believable to visitors. Hammond figured if he could fool a paleontologist into thinking he was seeing dinosaurs, a paleobotanist into thinking she was seeing extinct plants, and a mathematician into believing that the science all added up, he could probably fool a bunch of Wall Street day traders and their families."

But you can't jump 12 feet to the next column, and the next, and so on until you reach the edge. The middle has plenty of vines that reach the top, but edges do not.   They assume everyone who doesn't come back from the maze is dead instead of made it through. Fucking pessimists.   If they made it through, why wouldn't they send help?

Why doenst the helicopter go 1/4 of a mile further and pick everyone up?   and   They are told its an experiment to test there brain signals to cure a zombie apocalypse by the sun. Makes no sense.   The scene right after the helicopter pickup has the base leader (who was shown blowing her brains out earlier) explaining that some of the subjects (that is, the kids who are the main focus of the films) have passed and can start phase 2. Everything the kids saw after escaping the maze, the shot up base, the base leader's filmed explanation, etc. was a LIE. They aren't being rescued from a nightmare, they're just moving from one to another. The boys who were too scared and chose to stay in the glade failed the test. So there's no point in getting them. The sun death and zombie virus are a ploy to deceive the kids into complacency to prepare them for phase 2 of testing.

The empty space of objects is made of electron clouds occupying the space around the nucleus...not empty space. If you make these electron get closer to the nucleus of the atoms you change their energy level as they get closer to n=1 and that requires energy. It is like trying to explain the physics of a global flood of 26 miles of water covering the earth for a year...better not try and simply suspend disbelief to enjoy the story

Many scientific advancements are made by mistake and we don't find out the intricate details of what we have done for decades sometimes.  For the subatomic part I'd have to go with Pym not understanding what space he was shrinking. To him, the smallest thing is an atom, so when the particles are used to shrink things from their smallest part he assumes the space being shrunk is the space between atoms. But in this movie's universe string theory is obviously correct. So instead of the space between atoms being shrunk it's the space between strings, which allows for much higher level of density.  As for the weight consistency I'm not sure. My guess is that he actually doesn't keep the same ammount of weight and loses a lot when he shrinks, but actually gains strength through his muscles going through some sort of hyper-contraction along with the muscle fibers being condensed more and more. Shrinking itself could actually be a workout due to the changes in volume of muscle.   Another possibility for the increased resistance and loss of weight has to do with the space between atoms (or strings) again. Because there is such a reduced ammount of space between the atoms of his body he would have to become harder while also losing whatever weight came from those open pockets. This means that his fist could be as hard as metal or diamond making it able to transfer more force while also resisting damage better than his full sized body."

Most plant cell walls are very strong (if I remember my biology at all... dammit I'm a physicist, not a doctor Jim!) so they probably can hold onto their fluids as well as we can.

If you look at the phase diagram for water, you'll notice that at low pressures, regardless of temperature water becomes a gas.    What does this mean for a plant?  Plants transfer water between themselves and their environment in a regulated fashion.  There will be no freezing, but water will begin to evaporate faster on the surface of the plant.  The evaporation rate is controlled by valves called stroma on the surface of the leaves.  If the plant begins to lose water too quickly, the stroma will close and prevent further evaporation.  What this means is that short term exposure to the vacuum of space will likely have very little impact on the plant.  There will be no freezing water, and the plant won't likely die."

Planting an urge for exploration and discovery in hopes a humankind would not make the same mistakes they had).  The Thermians as we know them are the survivors of a near-extinction society (possibly after a dooms-day event among their people occured), or potentially second generation of a seed-vault (storage of genetic materials to allow a society to be reborn).  The survivors were technogically inferior, but surrounded by relics of a past society which is not their own.  When they viewed the show, it was believed to be an archive because all of the tech in existence in the show actually existed at some point of their own history, and so they were able to slowly rebuild their technology, but this time mimicing the exact look, feel and functionality of their idols.

The Dursley home is basically a magical shield for Harry from those who would wish to kill him.

plotholes,3c9woc,strangestdanger,0,Mon Jul 6 14:09:17 2015 UTC,"Ye, some other guy explained it in this subthread. But to me, it's a plothole. It doesn't have to be a ""paradox"". It's (Would be.) just completely against how the characters should behave, how a sane person would act.  For example, here's something from the terrible movie that Taken 3 is. Not really bad spoilers, because one key event is early in the movie, and this whole thing I describe is not just asinine, it's also quite unimportant. And the movie is shit, as I said. So: Dad puts a laced drink in a place where he knows his daughter would find it, with a note saying ""drink me right away"" or somesuch. She does so and goes to school. In class, she asks if she is excused because she feels nauseous. Goes to the girl's rest room (Apparently the only one the school has. Well, maybe it was just the clearly closest one.) and is surprised to meet dad in the last cabin. He tells her that he laced the drink and that he has a counter-agent for her so that she feels less shitty. She drinks it, then they exchange expressions of affection. He asks her if all is well and tells her to continue in the way she did so far. So, why did he kinda poison his daughter just to get her into that booth? Instead of just telling her to fake feeling ill? For no remotely justifying reason. Well, she surprisingly tells him something of value, but he couldn't expect that. On his way out, by the way, he pulls the school's fire alarm, having everyone flee in panic and destroying public and the pupil's property in the tens of thousands of dollars. Oh, did I mention that his wife, actual mother of this very daughter, had been murdered earlier in the movie? What an opportunity to poison the daughter to have some father daughter time on the toilet.  No paradox, just completely failed writing. But if you don't call at least one of the things I described a plothole, then I can only back away slowly."
plotholes,3c9woc,king_of_the_universe,0,Mon Jul 6 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Look, a plot hole is a sub-type of continuity errors (also known as plot errors).  It requires a paradox or an internal contradiction.  It's not a plot hole just because you feel that it's wrong.  Sending Harry back to the Dursley's was discussed by many characters as something they wish they didn't have to do.  Unfortunately for Harry, that's how the universe works as written by J.K. You also seem to have an overly emotional response to the Dursley's.  They don't treat him great, but they aren't the worst guardians in British literature, that's for sure.  As far as Taken 3 goes, the question you need to ask yourself is ""would either a sane person or a crazy person do this?""  If the answer is yes, then it isn't a plot hole.  In fact, independent character actions are almost impossible to label plot holes, because people in the real world do stupid, pointless things all the time.  Bad writing is bad writing, I'm not defending it, but that doesn't make it a plot hole.  Mental illness could certainly make a person think that he needs to poison his daughter in order to talk to her.  Maybe at this point, Liam Neeson has PTSD from his spy lifestyle and that fact that his daughter keeps getting kidnapped?  Maybe it's manifesting itself like this?  Maybe Only the events of Taken actually happened, and Liam Neeson is being treated in a psych ward as his mind takes him through a dozen (God help us) scenarios that play out much like the first?  When it comes to the fire alarms, you seem to be splitting hairs on property damage.  Ten's of thousands of dollars in damages is such a small price tag on this getaway compared to the expenses of all his other stunts.  In the highway scene alone he racks up hundreds of thousands in damages, and that doesn't include the people who must have died or who were injured in the catastrophe.  The real question is, if you are so ridiculously plot sensitive, why on Earth would you go see an action movie?  The genre is particularly known for weak plots whose only purpose is to make more absurd action scenes happen.  You might as well criticize a comic book for being too cheesy."

They used the show as a template and created the technology in real life. But the show itself was still an original fabrication, a fictional story. And the beryllium spheres were part of that fabrication. The question is, if the idea of a beryllium sphere was just some writer's idea of a future fuel source, and they're not created from the Thermians' technology (rather they're actually mined from the ground as a naturally occurring mineral structure), then how did the writer of a cheesy science fiction program know/luckily guess that such a naturally occurring structure exists and that it could be used to generate power for a ship.  The latter half of that could be chocked up to the Thermians' genius technological prowess that allowed them to find someway to turn this otherwise benign seeming rock into a power source. But that still begs the question of how the show writers just happened to match their fiction with a real naturally occurring object that was completely unknown to them and how they had a fairly close visual approximation of what said looks like on the show. The Thermians' influence has nothing at all to do with that."

(Actually a correctly implemented paradox is a commonly used and perfectly acceptable plot element, not a plot hole.) A plot hole is just a missing element to the plot that leaves the resulting story incomplete or inconsistent in some way. Something like some random television writer's made up object turning out to actually be a real naturally occurring object that shares all of the fictional object's traits and properties qualifies as a plot hole because it is so astronomically unlikely as to defy logic. There's got to be some more plausible explanation for this coincidence than random luck (in-story, of course).  Also, incidentally, trying to shut down discussion on a film topic by asserting that the film writer's can do what they like is the exact opposite of the purpose of this subreddit. They can of course, but the purpose of this forum is to discuss where their plot writing is lacking consistency or necessary details within the context of their stories."
plotholes,3c9woc,kryptonianCodeMonkey,0,Mon Jul 6 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"Here is the problem, even by your misunderstanding of plot holes, there is nothing inconsistent or incomplete about the examples you are giving.  Writers (even random, fictional ones from a spoof movie world) can do research into the things they are writing about.  It isn't an incomplete or inconsistent, nor is it ""so astronomically unlikely as to defy logic,"" as you put it.  If the movie had to go out of its way to explain every little thing from the perspective of the Galaxy Quest TV show writers perspective every single time, we never would have saw the movie, because it never would have been made.  That alone is why ""incomplete explanations"" can't be plot holes.  If they could be, every single scene from every single movie would be littered with them.   On to coincidence and random luck: the movie world depends on these things.  A story where everything goes exactly to plan and nothing unusual happens wouldn't really draw the crowds to the box office.  You can't just label them writing errors or plot holes, they are neither.  The best stories people share with each other have these seemingly improbable coincidences take place.  Audiences love coincidence, and extreme fits of luck (whether good or bad).  On a separate note, you seem to misunderstand the purpose of the subreddit.  The sidebar doesn't say ""to have a general discussion about the mechanics of universes writers created, especially the ones we don't like or think are wrong.""

Also the photo of Sarah Connor that was given by John to Kyle in the future was taken in mexico, when she was off the grid....which she wouldn't have been off the grid unless the events of Terminator happened.  Again, paradox. This isn't really a plot hole, but the entire first movie's plot is the paradox.

plotholes,3c0wxo,magusopus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"The best way to view a paradox like this without going crazy is thinking about scenes like one in Stargate Universe which included a time warp mechanic (one of many)  The episode was shot in such a way the audience's point of view follows a video camera's path (all scenes include the video camera in question either through direct recordings, or explainations of events in those recordings being shown in normal format (as if you were watching the show from a normal point of view.  So instead of flashbacks, we get a ""this is how it happened"").    The ending pans back to all of the characters staring in the recording watching themselves up to the point the camera is transported to them along with a warning effectively daying ""Don't go through the gate!""   They listen, and the story continues on as if nothing had happened, causing no further time loops from their own point of view.  (Loved that episode!)  To the point of view of the characters we see as our ""continuity"" characters (the ones we're watching), we never see the guys who managed to send back the message because we're now in a stable and locked loop.    In relation to the Terminator movies it would mean the first John Connor before time travel occurred had an existence far different from any John Connor created by the time loops and percieved paradox.  (Maybe the first John Connor had a mother who became a survivalist after marrying someone or joined the military shortly after believing she was stuck in a dead end job as a waitress with no prospects.  This gave her the skills to teach the very first John Connor to ""win"" the war and cause the first time loop.    Connor-2 sends back Kyle Reese-2 who falls in love with Sarah Connor, which triggers the Sarah Connor we see in T2.  Intriguing to say the least."

plotholes,3c0cuc,rmonik,3,Fri Jul 3 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"Writers care. Unless they self-publish, there are other people involved in the creation of a final product. When it comes to film, the director may change things, producers may change things, and studios may change things.   No writer tries to tell a bad story, but the stories we write are often at the mercy of opinions other than our own. And while not every writer is seeking to tell a profound story, and might just take a job or write something purely for its commercial viability, it's important to understand that studios are out to make money--and they will make creative changes that they think will either save money or make money. This might be artistically frustrating, but the other side of the coin is that studios that don't make money also don't stay in business.   I've heard that every M. Night Shyamalan film has made money. I believe it. Audiences have the power to demand better from studios and publishers with their wallets... but they don't. Films like Jurassic World and Terminator: Genisys don't get made because there's a deep, important story that adds to the universe to tell. They get made because they'll make money.   Of course, not everything does make money, but once something leaves a writer's hands, the creative decisions made favor profit over continuity. That's just the way it is."
plotholes,3c0cuc,GotNoGameGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"It's not just about making money though, movies can have giant mistakes and still make money if they have enough redeeming qualities. The thing i wonder is how the writers are okay with those mistakes being there. (and i'm pretty sure that they're aware of them being there, it really does not take a genius most of the time)  As a music producer myself, when i go to finish a piece, i want it to be FINISHED. I want every criticism i myself could have if i was a third party observer to be solved before i throw it into the public. A lot of times with movies i feel like the writers didn't do that. To bring up the butterfly effect again, the idea was great. Some guy that can alter his preset by going into his memories. Loads of potential. But then it's executed in a way that makes me think that they just don't care about the blatant issues, which is weird for something you spend so much time and effort on.   One could argue that it's just about the money, but there are easier ways to make money than to be in the film business so i highly doubt that was their first objective when they chose the career path."
plotholes,3c0cuc,GotNoGameGuy,2,Fri Jul 3 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"The thing i wonder is how the writers are okay with those mistakes being there.    Well, that's what I'm trying to say, though: Ultimately, a writer doesn't have any say in those mistakes being there. They're paid for a script. They turn one in. After that (with some exceptions) they're no longer part of the creative process. If a director wants to interpret a scene differently, they can. If a studio wants to rewrite the third act because it didn't test well with audiences, they'll turn it over to their in-house guys.   I'm not sure how it is in the music business, but the WGA is pretty serious about whose name gets put on a script. Although a writer might be credited with a script, they're rarely the last people to work on it.    A lot of times with movies i feel like the writers didn't do that.   But again, you're making the assumption that what you see on-screen is exactly what the writer wrote. That's almost never the case. And while studios definitely solicit third-party opinions, they're not concerned with a coherent narrative--they're concerned with audience appeal. If they're not getting good feedback, they can and do make changes, often with no concern for what impact they have on the story.   It's not coincidence that more summer blockbusters are including Asian locations--those are creative decisions specifically included to increase appeal to a huge (and growing) audience. That whole action sequence in Seoul in Age of Ultron? It's unlikely Joss Whedon made that decision. It's extremely likely that he was either told to include an Asian setting in the script (and worked it in using Dr. Cho) or the original scene took place somewhere else and it was changed to Seoul.   It's true, The Butterfly Effect was shit. But consider that Bress and Gruber were mostly known for the Final Destination series, and were most likely tapped to create a showcase vehicle for Ashton Kutcher. This film in particular is even more interesting, since they also directed it. It's a situation where I might agree with you: Given their history, and given the goal of the film, they probably didn't care as much about continuity as they did about what seemed cool on-screen. But even then, ultimately, creative control is driven by a studio and not a director. I don't know Bress or Gruber, and I have no knowledge of the development or production of the film, but I still strongly suspect their creative decisions were subject to studio oversight.    One could argue that it's just about the money, but there are easier ways to make money than to be in the film business so i highly doubt that was their first objective when they chose the career path.   I know some writers who have taken jobs simply for the money. I've done it myself. It's true, though, that most writers don't get into the film business to make money. But that's not really relevant here, since writers don't ultimately have creative control. The studio does, and they are in the film business to make money, and since their concern is profitability, and profitability is driven by audience appeal, coherent narrative simply isn't a major consideration. It is, has, and always will be about the money. No one will greenlight a production they think will lose money (with some exceptions--something that may lose money at the box office but win a bunch of awards will generate revenue in different ways, for example)."
plotholes,3c0cuc,GotNoGameGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:41:22 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true, but it just seems odd because let's face it, a lot of those mistakes were really easily avoided in writing.   You bring up a good point about the process of turning a story into a production though, i wonder how many issues could be attributed to a ""loss in translation"" so to speak. I'm not in the film industry so i'm not sure how that works exactly. Still though, it feels like a crime to be directing something that makes an audience cringe about the mistakes already since you obviously studied the story more than they did. I don't think i'd be able to do that, if i were a director, no matter who's fault it is."

But, you know, there are so many different reasons something might not turn out well. I like to believe that no one sets out to make a bad film or TV show or what have you, and we all try our best to make the best thing we can with what we've got to work with. There's a military acronym that I think applies to topics like these: FIGMO (Fuck it, I Got My Orders). Sometimes you know it's crap and you just shut up and do what you're being paid to do. Ultimately, the guys writing the checks make the decisions, and autonomy is based on clout. A guy like Spielberg probably has a lot more leeway than a first-time director--but even that's a bad thing, because you can still wind up with a film like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.   From a personal perspective, I've sold a story that was completely mauled into something else. For a while, I was furious. Then ashamed. But ultimately... I accepted that they had the right to go in their own direction (and this is what I tell people) and that I would have (and did) do things differently in my version. Thankfully, I'm not in a position where I have to make deals like that anymore. I can comfortably keep my creative integrity intact. But I'll admit there was a time when I would have shamelessly sold out if it meant a paycheck. Integrity is an expensive choice, and people have to put food on the table somehow. Everyone in my circle has taken a shit job for the money. A friend of mine once quoted a ridiculous sum just to get a client to walk away and instead they sent him a check. The job was awful. The requirements meant telling a good story was next-to-impossible, and the result was terrible. From there, other people got their hands on it and the quality just went downhill. The final product is embarrassing--but we laugh about it... FIGMO."

And actually something DOES change, the scars on his hands, but those aren't supposed to magically appear, when he got the cigaret burn he actually triggered a new timeline where nothing is altered cause a cigaret burn isn't that important i guess (hello movie title) so in that timeline, he's always had that cigaret burn and everyone around him should remember him having it. SO if we consider that the handstabbing had no effect on his past whatsoever (which is absolutely retarded i know) then he should still have triggered a new timeline with the scars on his hands, and he should've always had them since that incident.

You make the screws, store them somewhere convenient and now you do t ha e to wait for the screws to be manufactured, leaving the same assembly line available for something else).  As to why it is in the same room as the time machine?  Why not? Why waste time and resources transporting a million of those things either to, from, or both when all you've gotta do is mass produce them right next to it, and plug in a CPU created somewhere else?  (Even if you are still working the kinks out of the CPU you're tooling up some assembly line somewhere else to mass produce them in the near future).  Cost doesn't matter in a machine-created wasteland, only time, capacity and material, so who cares if a million or a hundred are created as long as Skynet has already pre-allocated how how much it would need to produce them?  Skynet probably also knows its last stand seems to be near that time machine more often than not, and so calculated its greatest chances of succeeding isnt going to be sending ONE old model terminator or one new model terminator but a fuckton of new ones...it just couldn't forsee the interception of the timetrotting duo (and again even if it knew they'd be in the future by info from past, it wouldnt know when, so would just plan and execute and deal with it later.  We also can't discount Skynet is running off the reasoning there is only one timeline and no alternate dimensions, so it runs by an errenous belief if time travel is possible, and something came from the past, it is safe to say the safest area will be  with the time machine (since no one could go to the past without it, and so it makes sense to put the important shit right next to it or near it.).   We, as the viewer of multiple timelines and alternative universes have a different understanding of the situation. And so some of the choices seem to make no sense."

Is it the one from 1973 that survived but just now caught up to them? Even if so, same questions: Who sent it? When?  And why the hell would they time travel to the day before Genisys?

plotholes,3brzs1,trinate18,6,Wed Jul 1 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"Alternative previous timeline.   I like to think of the whole Skynet vs John Connor thing like a bunch of repeated game over screens.   Our first view of the whole process is Skynet enslaves humanity, but is defeated by a John Connor who escapes human work camps and manages to up-rise (also leading a Kyle Reese he managed to free from another Concentration Camp).  Last ditch effort is to send a Terminator back to kill the dude who is about to kill it before he is born.  Focus is on killing Sarah Connor (Assuming she is a defenseless Female 18 year old and much less risk than a grown or nearly grown John Connor by observation and formula).  Terminator is defeated, but now is the problem...John Connor ends up even better than before because of his now militaristic Mother's mindset and ability to hide him by staying off the grid.  Cue T2.  Technology has a leap because of the broken CPU and Almost intact arm of the original Terminator, giving Skynet a boost, but John Connor has also gotten a level up because of the different things he has learned earlier than the original might have if left alone.  Skynet is defeated, great, right?  Well not really, because since time travel has been shown to have existed in at least one timeline/alternative universe, the odds of yet another alternative universe existing with time tech, and a different version of history now happens, but the worse part of it?  Some of the alternative timelines/universes are now affecting a whole slew of other timelines and universes...  Wow, right?  So yeah, we've now got an infinite number of not only alternative timelines, but alternative universes as well (for example a universe where it wasn't John Connor who lives and saves humanity, but some dude named Bob who was supposed to be his uncle, but never smiled.)  okay ,so thinking about all this, don't think of the current movie as a continuation of the same timeline or universe as the previous movies, think of it almost as a spinoff of a previous history's possibility (like what if Japan managed to not only pull off Pearl Harbor but an invasion of San Fransisco or somewhere else?).  So in some timelines universes Japan managed to invade the mainland, others they never even got close, and yet others someone managed to stave off the attack with a strategically placed anti-aircraft battery (where the HELL did that thing come from anyway?! IT WAS SHOOTING LIKE 50 OF THEM AT ONCE! ALIENS OR SOMETHING, MAN!)  Groovy, right?  As for Liquid Metal John Connor.  Imagine little tiny robots gobbling up your internals and replacing the cells they eat with other nano-bots that are about the same size (forming ""molecules"" of nano-bots effectively).  Quickest guess?  The nano-bots (liquid metal) left juuuuusssst enough biological matter to allow it to time travel once...then continued to replicate for 100% replacement.  Which would then make it impossible to travel using the current rules of time travel in the Terminator Universe (needing organic material as a shell at minimum to go back in time)."
plotholes,3brzs1,matejdro,3,Thu Jul 2 03:36:13 2015 UTC,"What I didn't get about T:Genisys is if all that happened in the movie was in another universe,i mean,when we see Kyle and John Connor at the start if the film,the year is 2029 and they're about to send Kyle back in 1985 like the first movie,but they send him in a different universe where Sarah has grew up with pops,also who sent pops?And another question about T2 is who sent the Friendly terminator to protect john connor?"
plotholes,3brzs1,RedEyeView,5,Thu Jul 2 09:03:58 2015 UTC,"The friendly Terminators to protect John are normally sent back in time by at least ONE of the Johns from an alternate universe and timeline (maybe not the one from the movie as we see it, but pretend there is another possible John Connor who decides its time to send back a terminator to protect himself).    Easier to just accept if there is a terminator then someone somewhere sent one back to protect themselves from some sort of percieved attack, most likely blindly (not knowing where something has been sent, not who why or what in most cases) like a sci-fi comlex equivalent to Whack-a-mole."
plotholes,3brzs1,Hatefullynch,2,Thu Jul 2 11:32:23 2015 UTC,"The trick to these movies is not only to think of them as alternate universes but Future John trying shooting things into the past to not only protect his ass but prevent the inevitable threat of SkyNet, which can and will happen simply as a matter of time.  The idea is ""Hey, how do I send a Terminator to protect me and cover all the bases to prevent this world ending AI from screwing up the future?"".    Like I told my wife, the timeline in these movies follows the Multiverse Theory in that they aren't just going back in time they're going back in time into another dimension.  That being said, with John Connor being assimilated in the future of this dimension which I'm assuming threaded from the T3 movie where John Connor grew up with his mother and got the full story of how she survived and ""stopped SkyNet"", Assimilated John Connor knew when and where to insert Terminators after the first Terminator was already sent so he could try and end things before they even began.  It was kinda like a russian roulette where SkyNet had just taken John Connor and tried to kill his mother at the source before she could even grow up, it didn't work because of Pops, and SkyNet sent John back to make sure SkyNet was built by the people they already knew had the tech contracts and expertise to build it, Cyberdyne.  Now we have a dimension where T2, T3, and Salvation didn't happen to prevent SkyNet from being built because Sarah and Kyle warped to 2017 because what happened in the future wasn't supposed to happened and Kyle's reaction caused a ripple in time where he was able to warn himself through the new timeline.  Skynet becomes Genysis with John's help from Future SkyNet, and the rest is in the movie.  Now, the questions we haven't answered is ""Who sent Pops back"" which is the question that leads me to believe there will be yet another sequel because as we know from the previous films SkyNet can and will happen as an inevitability.  But the clues I'm seeing from the film are the hologram of Matt Smith.  This is the image that SkyNet took in the future which makes me feel like this version of SkyNet, built by John Connor, somehow makes it the future to take out John Connor, which causes the ripple in time, which sets everything into motion.  What happens after John goes into the machine is most likely when someone sends Pops into the machine, after SkyNet probably tries to rebuild.  tl;dr It's best not to think about it."

She obviously had the terminator they were going to send back in time (see terminator judgement day) and sent him to save Sarah Connor in the 70's. Hence Pops is the Terminator from T2. Kyle shows up in this new timeline because the terminator went back further than him. Kyle remembers both plausible futures because as he went back in time he witnessed John get attacked (this is called the point of divergence, aka where two timeline's split. John wasn't supposed to die till later and it was supposed to be by the terminator that they sent back in T3 by Kate Connor)."

The EMH was only supposed to be used in an emergency for a short time. The assumption would be that only a starfleet officer would be interacting with the EMH and that a crewmember would only shut him off for a good reason. Remember also that he could be switched back on in an instant.     DS9 was a space station which expected all sorts of people including criminals to be interacting with the station so security was a big concern.   The programmers of the EMH thought of him like a light switch which people would turn on or off as needed. Why secure a light switch?"
plotholes,3bos8n,Creabhain,6,Tue Jun 30 23:42:34 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, but when a military vessel has guests, unexpected or no, the expectation is that security would be beefed up in the short term (e.g. security escorts) so the guests don't do stupid shit.  In the skills of Kim and Torres (and later, Seven), setting up long term securities for guests would have been relatively easy.  Say, guests could use the replicators but they couldn't turn off the EMH.  Why would guests need to turn off the EMH?    And since Voyager was stranded in the Delta quadrant, it'd be reasonable to assume they'd have guests and, clearly, the EMH would have been on full-time.   Am I just reaching here?  A lot of things changed when they got stranded, but the security expectations and ""supposed to's"" did not, which seems really odd."
plotholes,3bos8n,Creabhain,5,Tue Jun 30 23:55:01 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand why you think it is such a big deal that the EMH could be turned off? They weren't deleting it, just turning it off.    Why would security worry so much that time and effort would be spent making sure only authorized personal could switch him off? I mean as soon as he is needed he appears again.   What is the security advantage of forcing guests to keep him switched on? Why does it matter?"
plotholes,3bos8n,Creabhain,2,Wed Jul 1 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"One security advantage I can think of right now is avoiding the mess of Gar (Critical Care) stealing the doctor's program and installing a training version of him in his stead. No one noticed this happened. While stealing the doctor's emitter might not have been prevented, security would have been alerted once the training EMH replaced the doctor."
plotholes,3bos8n,Izwe,2,Wed Jul 1 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"That's a very specific set of circumstances , a perfect storm of events. I can't see anyone anticipating such an occurance and patching security to avoid it.   If even one human crewmember happened to walk in or a guard was keeping an eye on the visiter (a reasonable assumption) then that could not have happened.     There is no doubt that needing authorization to de-activate the EMH would have been a wise precaution. I just think that it is logical that such a precaution would have been overlooked as the chances of it being needed was so slim and the time and effort to implement it too much for such a small risk.     We don't secure the light switches in our homes so a visiter might open one up and rig it to hurt the next person to turn on a light. Sure, it could happen but we don't believe it is very likely to happen without us noticing so we don't spend time and money locking every switch down."
plotholes,3bos8n,Castule,3,Wed Jul 1 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"I always thought Voyager was a science vessel, but your point would still stand in that case anyway.  Additionally, DS9 isn't a Starfleet space station, so the security systems would be totally different."
plotholes,3bos8n,Izwe,7,Wed Jul 1 12:09:50 2015 UTC,"This was an issue early on in the series, but later on (spoiler alert) he asks to have control over his program so he can come and go as he pleases. He also asks to be treated like a member of the crew by not being activated and de-activated on someone's whim. I really like this show because it tackled what it meant to be 'alive'. He fought for his rights as a sentient being and eventually got them."

plotholes,3bos8n,IkLms,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:12:54 2015 UTC,Perhaps there were security measures that prevent transportation other than internal ship originated transports. Some type of field so that enemy ships couldn't just transport crew into space during a battle. If these measures were part of the transportation systems then those systems being offline might prevent decativation of the field or something like that.
plotholes,3bos8n,Xenosaj,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"It's been a bit of an issue in many of the series. In TOS it was a common issue also, including the time they allowed Khan to completely read up on all the tech manuals for the ship including it's weapons and drive systems.  Star Trek in general just tends to have absolutely terrible security procedures. They also don't raise shields when confronted with an unknown craft of unknown intentions (as standard procedure should be) which also bites them in the ass often.  They tend to give guests free rein to go almost anywhere on the ship without an escort, which unsurprisingly also bites them in the ass.  DS9 is really the only one that gets it right more often than not, Enterprise tends to be usually good also."
plotholes,3bos8n,gatlin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"One big difference is Odo and the fact that he's specifically designated the Constable of DS9.  He's effectively the chief of police on the station, constantly on guard against criminal activities, which is usually in the form of Quark.  He also takes quite a bit of pride in out-thinking the criminal element on the station and thwarting their plans.  He also was found and raised by the Cardassians, a species that's deceptive and treacherous by nature.  I'm sure he learned very quickly not to trust anyone.  They don't have the same environment on a Federation starship, and obviously not someone constantly playing blackhat.  There's also the reasonable expectation that anyone on the ship is supposed to be there, so there's a tradeoff just as there is today in real life of absolute security versus diminished usability.  Another possibility is that the tiny possibility of an unauthorized user abusing the EMH is worth the risk if it means that anyone on the ship can activate the EMH in the event that medical attention is required.  At some point safety outweighs security; you don't keep your fire extinguishers and first aid kits locked up in your combination lock safe, after all."

When he asks why, then, can just anyone use the intercom, Picard explains that in the future adults don't need to be told not to do things like that."

It's designed to freeze for a number of years (up to at least 1000 years) - being off a few hours is probably going to be considered an acceptable tolerance in the same way that a sprinkler timer or one of those plug-in-lamp timers might be tuned 5-minutes increments and go off at 6:30 instead of 6:33 like I might have wanted.  Like, maybe the system was initially set up at 2pm, and so the number of days is always counted from 2pm and ends 2pm on whatever day is the final day...

plotholes,3awmdw,cyberkitten,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:45:21 2015 UTC,"My own headcanon is that the term ""quadrant"" does not mean Alpha quadrant or Beta quadrant.  Rather, it was just a quarter division of a sector or some other smaller division of space.  After all, a quadrant just means ""each of four parts of space divided by two planes at right angles.""  I take that as to be confirmed by what Sulu says right when they meet Reliant.  He says""Reliant in our section this quadrant.""  If they were really talking about the 4 divisions of the galaxy, then he would have been stating the obvious.    I think the Enterprise was simply the closest ship, the only one in that part of the sector.  Other ships might have been in range, but the Genesis project was importatint enough that Starfleet Command could not wait for another vessel to take a few hours to get there.  They also might have noted they no longer were in communication with Reliant, which hightened the urgency (although for some reason, they didn't pass this on to Kirk.)  Also, I always thought there may have been some off screen warp travel.  It was a training voyage, after all.  The cadets would need to learn warp operations.  They may have come in and out of warp a few times off screen during training exercises.    I also have to imagine long range sensor nets would detect incoming fleets and give Starfleet enough time to recall ships as needed."
plotholes,3awmdw,derf82,2,Wed Jun 24 12:26:41 2015 UTC,"A few things here:  1) We know they have not gone to Warp until this point because Kirk specifically makes a point of asking if the training crew was ready for Warp after this scene.  2) We know that the Enterprise was a minimum of a day away or so from Genesis even at Warp.  There are two scenes after they enter Warp (one on the Genesis station before Khan gets there, another on Khan's ship) and then there's a scene on the Enterprise where Kirk asks for an ETA and Spock tells him 13 hours still.  3) We know that Starfleet is still in contact with Reliant because they were given an update on the Enterprise's position."

No, he does not.  This is what he asks:    KIRK: I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock, those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?  SPOCK: Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts.   Nothing about warp.  The first time warp is mentioned is when they go to warp, but it is never mentioned they were never going to warp.     2) We know that the Enterprise was a minimum of a day away or so from Genesis even at Warp. There are two scenes after they enter Warp (one on the Genesis station before Khan gets there, another on Khan's ship) and then there's a scene on the Enterprise where Kirk asks for an ETA and Spock tells him 13 hours still.   While true at one point Spock indicates they have 12h 43m to go, I don't think it is reasonble to assume the activity between going to warp and this scene took 11 hours.  To me, it would seem this was within an hour or 2.  Trying to contact Regula 1 again would be the first reasonable step in the investigation.    Also, Enterprise was not going fast.  When Spock gives that time, he says ""Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.  That seems to imply there are other, faster speeds available. Indeed, according to the script, Kirk orders Warp 5, well below the maximum speed of Warp 8 and even below stardard cruising speed of Warp 6.  While inconisistent with my idea that Starfleet Command had a lot of urgency, perhaps this was simply not passed on to Kirk as well as it could have, and he ordered a slower speed.     3) We know that Starfleet is still in contact with Reliant because they were given an update on the Enterprise's position.   I don't recall any scene after Khan's takeover where Starfleet gave them Enterprise's position.  He was able to locate the ship, but I figured this was based on Terell and Chekov's knowlede as well as the Enterprise's transponder."

The above is the first mention of warp in the movie.   I suppose you could be talking about this conversation, but it is far more general.     KIRK: Well, Mister Scott, are your cadets capable of handling a minor training cruise?  SCOTT: Give the word, Admiral!  KIRK: Mister Scott, the word is given.

Its then that the Dr call Kirk and Kirk leaves shortly there after. Yet Reliant still beats the Enterprise there.   Khan easily could have had Chekov lie.  Or maybe they were going to go slower, and decided to speed up when it became evident the science team wasn't going to just hand Genesis over.    Speeds are not fixed in the film.  It is evident the Enterprise was going only Warp 5 (and warp speeds are logarithmic, so warp 6 is several times faster than warp 5).  Perhaps Reliant was 3 days away at warp 4 but could get there much faster at warp 8.     3) If that was the case then they should have disabled enterprise using the same knowledge.

You'd think that after 4 episodes of dinos killing humans there would be some serious precautions in place but naah.     This is again literally the plot of the movie, you claim to love Jurassic Park, but you don't even understand that the message is mainly about how people were never really in control. In Jurassic Park, the reliance on automation and blind science to ""control"" the dinosaurs led to the park's failure.  In Jurassic World the feelings of control because the park had been successful thus far, and the belief that the hybrids were ""safe"" caused the parks failure.  Both of these events occurred in-spite of all the security precautions that existed, going into the Chaos Theory aspect of the books.     Those ""balls"" that folks ride along dinosaurs is the most pointless thing ever. Little kids can take control of it and do whatever the hell they want. In the middle of a dinosaur habitat. Of course that would be a thing!     Maybe there's a minimum age/height to ride, like every other amusement park ever... They mention the ""invisible fence"" system to protect against dilophosaurus venom, which probably works by preventing the gyrospheres from getting too close/touching the dinosaurs. They also might have a way to recall the gyrospheres from the control room, but the one in the movie was out of range.     The security and control room is the least secured facility I've ever seen. Non identified people, even hostile looking people, go in without a single fuck given while the security guys at the gate just sigh. Dozens.of.time.throughout.the.movie. Even their acting is laughable because it's so absurd. It's so unrealistic it hurts the brain.     Which hostile people? The In-Gen security people? They were allowed to resolve the situation by the board of In-Gen/the park; the only people who thought they were hostile were those being replaced. Also, if you actually watched the movie, you'd notice that there were guards when Masrani went on the helicopter allowing one to conclude that the control room did have a moderate level of security.  Plus, this area would already be off-limits to the guests, why would they need massive security?    This is one of the worst plotholes writeups I've ever seen, you've taken most of the films artistic liberties at face value, and then complain when they don't line up perfectly with reality."

This scene was so utterly ridiculous it made me wonder why they even needed a ""cylon detector"" - just see if there's a usb port in their arm, for crying out loud.  What's even dumber is that in the miniseries, the ship's doctor mentioned that they didn't know the spy was a cylon until they cremated him, when they found non-organic material in amongst the ashes. I'm wondering, surely they have a way of detecting those non-organic components in an uncremated body?

Fireflies don't have cybernetic inside-bits and they generate light just fine. Lots of biological creatures do. Similarly, organic computing is theoretically plausible if not possible with 21st-century technology. Technology to interpret electrical signals sent from the brain into digital data exists today and doesn't require anything as ridiculous as USB ports--it simply takes electrodes. It is not at all unreasonable to expect advances to continue to the point where organic electrodes are developed. Sufficient advances in computing would allow a biological interface with any electronic device.   Of course, that's not possible today, but you're applying 21st-century anachronism to a technology clearly more sophisticated and then calling it a plot hole. That's bullcrap, man."

They definitely painted themselves into some holes as they went along which they tried to retcon their way out of with 'The Plan'. The cylon detector was horse shit until after Baltar got the nuke and eventually got it working as per it detecting Sharon but then he stopped giving a fuck and just faked test results going forward.   The glowing spine thing was abandoned about half way through season 1 because it was really stupid, I mean thank god the cylons weren't into Doggie Style.

I didn't realize there was confusion about it. Yes, human models of Cylons are indistinguishable, except for some reason (they believe it's religious) they can't produce biologically. Bioluminescence occurs in cells, and organic matter doesn't show in x-rays. Here is an x-ray of a normal, healthy spine. Can you spot the elements of the central nervous system? I mean, here's what you should be looking for in that x-ray.   Logically, humans and Cylons must be 100% indistinguishable from each other--otherwise a hybrid child like Hera could never be conceived, in the same way that you can't create a human-chimp hybrid by having sex with a chimp.

I wouldn't even say it counts as a bad decision.  What happened was a pretty freak occurence which nobody would be expected to think of when they were designing the ride. The things were intended to roll around in a sectioned off area among herbivorous animals. I imagine that, if the question of 'how do we get one of these things back if the drivers faint or something?' was raised, the answer would have been 'someone can just drive out and get it' not 'lets spend millions of dollars installing cameras and remote-control receivers into all of them so that they can be remotely piloted around the place'."

plotholes,394ths,ActualButt,21,Tue Jun 9 19:13:00 2015 UTC,I can't really tell whats happening in the second screenshot but I think I get what you are getting at. However it is a different room.
plotholes,394ths,Pipthepirate,10,Tue Jun 9 09:28:27 2015 UTC,"They're pulling up the carpet in michael's office because Todd Packer took a shit on it and the cleaning lady scrubbed the smell into the carpet.   Also, in season 9 episode 11, they pull up the carpet again (in the bull pen. The same room as the first photo) and they find hardwood again. It's entirely plausible to have hardwood in one room and carpet in another, so the photo OP posted has bo point."
plotholes,394ths,fuzzypyrocat,3,Tue Jun 9 19:15:05 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be that unusual for distinct areas of an office to have differing floor treatments.
plotholes,394ths,unreqistered,3,Tue Jun 9 19:24:03 2015 UTC,"When you do a commercial renovation you remove the old flooring before installing the new, you don't stack it up.  Even something thin like linoleum would likely be removed, and any hardwood treatment would certainly be removed before laying carpet.  The likelihood of any commercial space renovation involving covering hardwood with carpet is nearly nil.  As somebody interested in such things, I realized they were transposing a common occurrence in residential remodels (you pull up the carpet to discover the much better hardwood, common in houses built in the 60's and earlier) to make a joke, and laughed, despite knowing it was a near impossibility."
