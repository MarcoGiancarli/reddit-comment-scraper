whatsthisplant,3e4ui2,amkili,4,Tue Jul 21 23:51:48 2015 UTC,"Fun fact(s):  -Pinedrops are non-photosynthetic/parasitic plants that feed on carbohydrates they steal from nearby pines via shared mycorrhizae.  -At one time they were thought to be a saprophyte, meaning they feed on dead or dying organic matter (in fact, all members of the Monotropoideae were believed to be), but more recent research and thought has proven that to be incorrect.  -In the 60's they did a bunch of research using radiotracers and saw that material was moving from nearby photosynthetic plants to the achlorophyllous plants via mycorrhizal connections, making them highly specialized myco-heterotrophs, not saprophytes. Pretty cool stuff."

Not sure about ""rose mallow""-- when I googled it it seems like the hibiscus species usually called rose mallow has lighter flowers and flowers borne apically rather than along the stems (as in this plant)-- but of course the problem with common names is that they can be very broadly applied. Especially since there are so many cultivars of Hibiscus, I'm afraid genus is as far as I can get with this one."
whatsthisplant,3e40uq,treerabbit,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:07 2015 UTC,Cool! I guess I always thought hibiscus was a tropical or warm weather plant. I'm guessing that this variety is better suited for the colder climate here?

whatsthisplant,3e1u81,birds_of_berlin_ny,3,Tue Jul 21 08:40:59 2015 UTC,A Siberian larch. Tamarack. It is the only deciduous pine tree. The color changes are very colorful. Larch needles that fall off every year have been found in Siberian graves. They were considered sacred for their ability to die and be alive again in the spring. The new needles are very soft. A beautiful tree.
whatsthisplant,3e1u81,Hardrainfalling,9,Tue Jul 21 08:52:44 2015 UTC,"It is the only deciduous pine tree.   This part is not correct.  Larch is in the Pinales order but it's not a pine. The Pinales family includes all extant conifers, such as cedar, cypress, fir, juniper, larch, pine, redwood, spruce, and yew. The term pine specifically refers to plants in the Pinus genus.  It's also not the only deciduous member of the Pinales family. Dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), and pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) are all deciduous as well.  Anyway, I do agree with larch tree (genus Larix). I'm not sure how to ID it at the species level, but depending on who you ask, there's anywhere from 10-15 species of larch. So it seems that even the experts don't fully agree on how to distinguish larch species from each other."
whatsthisplant,3e1u81,blacksheep998,2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:47 2015 UTC,"I think they may be right about it being the only deciduous genus in the pine family, though-- everything else you listed is in Cupressaceae, right?  Edit: just did a quick search and looks like there's also the monotypic genus Pseudolarix in Pinaceae, but yeah, the rest are in Cupressaceae. The original point, though, is still correct, in that larches are not in the Pinus genus and thus are not pines."
whatsthisplant,3e1u81,treerabbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"But have you ever planted them when they are only eight inches tall and are planted in a plastic tube? The Forest Service gives away larch trees at the Mall, (used to) and you watch them get 25 feet tall? And you have fallen completely in love with them and the man who helped you plant them? And then he dies and you move and they are the only thing you hate to leave behind. And you pray the new owners of your house will take care of them and the street never gets widened and they are cut down because you lived on a dirt road on the hillside in Anchorage, Alaska?"
whatsthisplant,3e1u81,Hardrainfalling,8,Tue Jul 21 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"It's in Pinaceae, sure, but I wouldn't call it a deciduous pine. Genus is Larix."

Deer will strip them up to about 4 feet from the ground and once they've lost all the green off a portion they generally don't recover. The tops will continue to grow and be fine, but they make for a crappy hedge.  If you do want a hedgerow there I'd recommend an columnar boxwood or cherry laurel.

whatsthisplant,3dz0fg,dad-of-redditors,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on how widespread it is.  If it's patchy, you can take a weeder (long metal stick with a forked end) stick it in the ground near the roots and dig it up.  If it's widespread you could use Roundup (not sure if this is an ""organic-leaning"" subreddit) but that would take out everything it touches.  Whatever you do, don't let it go to seed.  And always remove the plants you pull out of the ground.  A couple of months ago I completely weeded a flower bed that was rampant with crabgrass and I left it lying in the bed thinking the sun would fry it.  WRONG.  It rained that night, I forgot about it, and almost all of it rooted and is quite healthy and strong again.    Or  Look on the bright side.

Not sure about peppers, but tomatoes are a good example of this. You can bury 2/3 of the seedling for a stronger plant. You can't do this with everything, though. Some plants will die if you plant them too deep."

So usually when you see this, it's a sign of too much water, the humidity shouldn't be so high that the plant thinks it's buried, you may be giving it too much water or it has poor airflow near the base. While roots are fine, usually if the humidity is that high it means your plant is at a very high risk of molds and mildews attacking it."

Doesn't seem to re-grow leaves from where they are cut - just grows taller and grows more sort of. POSSIBLY bought in Florida or somewhere else down south. Was purchased years ago while he was driving tractor trailer. His memory is shady on where he got it. It appears to be doing great re-potted as its own 'branch'.

I suppose you could nuke your lawn with a broadleaf herbicide, although I have no experience with that sort of thing.  I'd try asking someone at a lawn & garden center.

whatsthisplant,3doyda,d00fus666,2,Sat Jul 18 02:20:40 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a fasciata - those are rare plants but mainly the dots and leaf size are different to this plant. It looks more like an etiolated h. reinwardtii to me. Even then I don't think that's a match - might be some kind of hybrid?

The same goes for chickens, pigs, and cows.  We have been modifying them so far away from nature that most animals can't even breed normally anymore because we fucked with them. And if you think I'm wrong, look up what happened to the Gros Micheal, or what is happening right now to the Cavendish. Every banana you eat is a clone, and because there is no diversity, they are no longer viable. The banana I was eating in the late 50's and up to about 1970 has been wiped off the face of the Earth by a fungus, and the same thing is happening to the bananas we eat today.

whatsthisplant,3deyvy,superdankmaymays,16,Wed Jul 15 19:22:26 2015 UTC,It's sorghum.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum  I'm guessing you have a bird feeder nearby?
whatsthisplant,3deyvy,c4ptainmorgan,7,Wed Jul 15 19:39:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help. We have a parrot and it is highly likely that his cage has been cleaned in that area.
whatsthisplant,3dgbgd,ctoston,6,Thu Jul 16 01:22:12 2015 UTC,Probably a Bird's Nest Sansevieria - we've had them for years and they truly are indestructible!
whatsthisplant,3dgbgd,skysong4,3,Thu Jul 16 05:25:52 2015 UTC,Looks like some sort of mother in laws tongue.
whatsthisplant,3dgbgd,kigid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:42:22 2015 UTC,I am most interested in knowing if it is safe for cats :) I got it about 2 years ago. I started with just one and it had babies! So now I am trying to spread the love by giving some to friends. Just want to make sure it's cat safe first :)
whatsthisplant,3dgbgd,AllAccessAndy,3,Thu Jul 16 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's some variety of Sansevieria, not a bromeliad."
whatsthisplant,3dgbgd,are_you-serious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:12:26 2015 UTC,Could be.  I still think it looks like some cultivar of Aechmea fasciata (Bromeliad family) that flowered before OP got it and now it is producing pups (Since they generally live a long time but only flower once).  What suggests that it is Sansevieria and not that (for my education purposes)?
whatsthisplant,3dgbgd,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:32 2015 UTC,I haven't seen Aechmea leaves that pointed. They tend to have more truncated ends to the leaves.

whatsthisplant,3dflr5,allonsyyy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:08:28 2015 UTC,I'd just forage it-- grows in masses along roadsides and infrequently mown lawns

whatsthisplant,3dfcqz,cacheego,2,Wed Jul 15 23:18:26 2015 UTC,It was a hispanic grocery store and they look the same. Thanks!
whatsthisplant,3dfcqz,dantenuevo,2,Wed Jul 15 23:32:47 2015 UTC,You are right. They are guajes and you can use them in salsas and beans. Guajes taste really good but be carefull... You will be farting as you never have.
whatsthisplant,3dfcqz,FuzzyHappyBunnies,2,Thu Jul 16 03:20:35 2015 UTC,So they turned out to be guajes like /u/cacheego said. We roasted them over fire and ate them out of the pod. Pretty darn tasty

whatsthisplant,3dfcqz,mysecondattempt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:13 2015 UTC,Try soaking them and see if they hydrate a bit.  You could prepare them like Greek beans with tomatoes.
