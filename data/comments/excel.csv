Put this in cell C2: =IF(OR(A2="" QB"",A2=""DM""),B21.4,IF(A2=""WR"",B21.2,FALSE)) In this formula, if the type of player is either QB or DM each yard will give you 1.4 points.

But here's my methodology:     Open conditional formatting change the scope to ""This Worksheet"" (Default is Current Selection) Click New Rule Specify formula type and enter Specify formatting Click OK In Rule list, type the applicable rule range Click Apply   Now if you first select the beginning cell of which you are going to model the formula, then it doesn't mess up the formula contents, but the Range won't stick when you click apply.  For example, you will accept your formula rule then go to enter the applicable range which is set to where ever your current focus is.  As soon as you type "":"" at the end to give the end of the range, it comes up with it's own thing.  It was:     =$A$1 It now becomes     =$A$1$A$1:$A$50  And that's just after typing a simple colon.  It always repeats the first part of the range and comes up with some arbitrary end-part.

To get around this, insert the Indirect formula.  It'll look something like this:  =vlookup(A1,indirect(B1),x,0)   What I would do (assuming that your table array varies rows, but maintains columns) is reference the array by selecting the entire columns (ex: C:F) and then using Match() to pick the right column.  That formula would look something like this:  =vlookup(A1,C:F,match(B1,C1:G1,0),0)   What this does is look up the value in A1, using the array C:F, the match formula will match whatever is in B1 to a column header in C1:G1.

excel,3e2091,turner_prize,3,Tue Jul 21 10:42:53 2015 UTC,"Glad to help.  The breakdown of the formula is basically: =if(logical test, if the logical test is true then do this, or else do this if its not)  The speechmarks are there to add any string (like text) to a formula. So you can add text to a formula. The fact that there is no space in the formula between the speechmarks, is basically tell excel to check if there is nothing at all in the cell.  So in this case if Cell C7 is blank, then show the current cell as blank, or else show whatever is in cell C7.  You could have a little play with this to help you understand, by changing it to =if(C7="""", True,False) and it will show as true if the cell is empty, or false if there is any value (text or number) in the cell. That might help you get your head round it a little bit.  Sorry if this is a bit confusing, I'm better at working with excel than I am at explain why things work!"

You're setting Test as string, and then trying to use it as a range, so it ends up as a type mismatch when you try and set ReadingCount from the Test string (excel wants you to set Test as a range, not a string). That also wont allow you to use msgbox with Test, and you'll also need to 'set' Test.  Also, there is a small type in the paste line, an underscore after skip blanks which is causing some trouble.  The below should work for you.  Sub CopyFormula2()  Dim sh As Worksheet  Dim k As Long  Dim Test As Range  Dim Formula As Range  Dim ReadingCount As Range  Set sh = ActiveSheet  k = sh.Range(""G2000"").End(xlUp).Row  MsgBox k  Set Test = Range(""H13:AE"" & k)  Set Formula = Range(""H12:AE12"")  Set ReadingCount = Test  Formula.Copy  ReadingCount.Select  Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteFormulas, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks:=False, Transpose:=False  End Sub   ninja edit: you also don't need to use Chr(34) like you have done."

excel,3e3r16,question89,4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you don't have much data.  Excel can help find correlations, but in your situation, it sounds like there is a tremendous amount of assumptions that would need to be made and your forecast would be basically a wild guess.  For example - if you had 100% of your products available online, are you assuming you would have 4 times as many sales compared to 25% of your products online?  Why were those 25% selected? Do they sell better in store?  Is it just a random sample of available products?  Is it related to shipping? If you offered additional products online, would they be options related to current offerings: for example do you currently sell one type of flashlight online, but would be adding a long-life one, a small portable one, and a super-bright one?  Many of these factors could reduce (or increase) expected sales increases by offering more products.  Online can be a different marketplace than a brick and mortar location - things you have in store might not be easily available within a 10 mile driving radius elsewhere, whereas there are usually competitors online that have the same products available and it doesn't take much effort at all for a consumer to shop around.  If you offered other items online, would they still be niche items?  Or can you offer a better experience than competitors online for these items (price, quality, ease of use, reliability, shipping, etc)?  I'm not trying to be a jerk in saying this, but if, as you say, you have two lines of data, then trying to make a prediction is going to be this simple:  If you offer 4 times as many products online, you would have 4 times as many sales.   To figure out how this would impact your revenue you could use Excel or Wolfram Alpha or google or a calculator: Multiply your online sales by 4.  Add that to your retail sales for your total expected revenue.  Divide the online forecast by this new total to see the new share of sales coming from online.  Like I said, this is just a wild guess.  You really need to look at a lot more details and data to attempt an accurate prediction.  If you have more data, /r/excel can help with some specifics."

A better solution might be to split the contents of your cells into three seperate columns each (i.e. instead of one cell containing ""DK_E RP"" have three separate cells say ""DK"" ""E"" ""RP""), then have your addition formula refer to those instead of parts of a text string.

Basically what the formula is doing is finding the closest match to column B/C's value in column F/G. Then, if either difference of their absolute values is greater than 0.3, the formula returns N/A. Otherwise, it returns the closest value it originally found.  Hope this helps!"

Here's how you do it in other languages, assuming your array is called MyArray and you want to append Hello world! to each:  myArray << ""Hello world!"" # Ruby myArray.append(""Hello world!"") # Python myArray.push_back(""Hello world!""); # C++ (kinda cheating, this uses a vector) myArray.push(""Hello world!""); # JavaScript    And then, there's VBA:  ReDim Preserve myArray(1 to UBound(myArray) + 1) As String myArray(UBound(myArray)) = ""Hello world!""    Yes, of course, you can always create a variable that simply holds the length of the array, but something like this should be included. Redefining the array just to add a variable to the end?

excel,3dyqmo,xlViki,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a shorter way to do it. You can arbitrarily give a large upper bound when initializing the array the first time, to avoid having to Redim every time. But that's not a good practice since that is not a flexible and reliable way to code a program.   If you're passing values from a range, it's always best to pass the range directly to an array like:  myArray = Sheets(1).Range(""A1:C20"")   But then again, this is useful only in this one case (Range to Array).   So, I think the best way to go about it is to somehow find the length needed for the array before creating the array, by counting the elements you're going to add to it and then using that length when initializing the array. I know it's not always possible or practical in many situations, but whenever it is possible, this method will be faster than Redim Preserve."

excel,3ds4i7,Little_Kitty,2,Sun Jul 19 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"It's one of the things that happens when you edit files - they grow.  Excel does track changes to some extent.  To prove this to yourself, create a new workbook, in A2:A55 enter the formula RANDBETWEEN(1,8).  Copy this formul to B1:AD1.  In cell B2, enter the formula A2<>B1, then copy that left & down to the end.  Save the file as test 1.xlsx.  Now go back and edit the formula to IF(A2=B1,TRUE,FALSE) and save it as test 1a.xlsx.  You'll notice the file size is slightly larger.  Start a new worksheet, repeat the steps above, but only write in the second formula (skip the first one), save it as test 2.xlsx.  The size of this file is roughly the same as the original test 1.xlsx.  The file sizes I get are test1.xlsx 20,087 B, Test 1a.xlsx 20,683 B, test 2.xlsx 20,227 B.  Note that test1a and test 2 have the exact same content.  Now edit test 1a further, add some colouring, change font sizes, add some borders.  Save the file.  Now format the cells again back to standard and you'll see it's a couple of hundred bytes larger than it was - I managed to get 21,602 B with some extended fiddling.  That's with essentially one common formula, operating over a range of connected cells, so it's easy enough to compress.  Lots of different and unconnected formulas compounds this.

Fundamentally, Excel is not a BI platform - yes you can make graphs and such, but there are other properly designed applications which leave even fancy implementations in the dust.  Excel is good for financial modelling and crunching small to medium sets of numbers, and in that area it's hard to compete with.  But let's not fool ourselves into thinking it's going to replace different applications."
excel,3dqjbi,Little_Kitty,5,Sat Jul 18 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to go ahead and disagree with you there. Excel, in addition to some first party plugins (that are going to be built-in when 2016 appears) turn Excel into a legit central point for Business Intelligence: -ETL with Power Query (connect to many, many sources) -Data Model with PowerPivot (If you know Excel formulas, you pretty much know how to use this. Can also handle into the many multi-millions of rows of data nicely) -User PowerView (Which I'm not a fan of) or the regular old charts and tables that hundreds of millions of users already know how to use.  I think PowerView and PowerMap are a little stunted as of today, but I've seen previews that indicate that they're going to be getting pretty sweet.  Here's an article from a really smart guy about how Excel is king(ish): http://www.powerpivotpro.com/2015/06/no-more-apologies-excel-is-the-worlds-best-data-tool-period/"
excel,3dqjbi,Heppet,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"You can disagree, but you'd be wrong, and I say that as someone who's been a 'go to' guy for Excel for over ten years.  If you submitted an RFP for BI in the field I work in and said you intended to use Excel as your BI platform, you'd stand no chance of winning.  Properly implemented BI is so much more than what you've covered, it's automatic PDF production, email & sms alerts, spreadsheet production, online interfaces for complex reports and downloadable versions.  Back end & front end databases with forms for clients to handle data cleansing and set up business rules.  It's integration with proper programming languages like R for predictive analytics.  The whole interface should also be in the clients 'corporate style'.  I use Excel a fair amount every day, and while I'm familiar with PowerPivot I'm not really impressed.  Fundamentally it's still thinking about things in the same underlying way, which works nicely if you want to do something simple like plot sales over time with user selectable groups, but the functionality available in more serious BI tools makes it look outdated.  I read the link, and I'd agree with two things with a lot of BI implementations - the idea that a lot of the time they're not used (best dealt with by pushing the important messages to the users via email / SMS), and that 'download to Excel' is important.  The second becomes much less used when clients trust you to manipulate the data, but in the prototyping / early implementation days it's often used.  As I said above, Excel is not a BI platform, it's one tool in your arsenal, and used correctly it's the right one for some tasks, but it's not the be all and end all.  ""If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"""
excel,3dqjbi,Little_Kitty,3,Sun Jul 19 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"Let me just say this. I work for a company very high up in the Fortune 500. While IT has spent years deciding what they want to do with our data, I have built dozens of working applications using the PowerBI platform. They still have no product. And I can respond to a request in hours rather than waiting for who knows how long for IT to, for example, create a new dimension or measure. I like to think that PowerBI is democratizing business intelligence, bringing it to the masses. Taking it out of IT and putting it in the hands of the analysts who really know what to do with it, with care that is."

The problem you describe with people being very slow is a serious issue, and one that isn't an issue with the way we work.  We also field multiple ad hoc requests per day, and sometimes deliver them in Excel, sometimes PDF, sometimes completely different software that's more specialised.  Excel, and the tools which work with it are tools to use in the right time and place, but they don't make a BI platform on their own.  People clearly fail to understand this not just here, but with some clients where I've found awful Excel messes which take weeks to unpick, are full of bugs, and can be done thousands of times faster with a properly built solution that uses the right tools for the job.  As an external agent, I need to be able to deliver what companies & public bodies of wildly different sizes need, with huge variations in their employees' technical knowledge.  There is no one tool that can come close to doing all this.  The right database for our client with a couple of billion records, three major distinct data sources and a desire for OLAP is not what I'm going to use for procurement tracking for a council.

So high odds equal low payout and low odds equal high payout. Isn't that why betting on the underdog will sometimes grant you higher winnings against all odds?

For example  is in cell A1   =   <h2 class=""title""><a href=""gardencats.com/cabbage/  is in cell a2    =   ..."" data-hislog=""1732120934"" data-pid=""1732120934"" data-domdot=""id:2678,pid:1732120934,ext:'|n=14'"" target=""_blank"">  Where the ""..."" is different for every single different URL?  I think the best way to describe what I'm trying to do is the following.   The data I am using is the source code for a Google search for ""chicken"". There are multiple pages of chicken and what I'm interested in is what the title is of the page and the url of that page.  https://www.google.ca/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=__qtVffxGPTF8Aezn6qICw#q=chicken  So my first title is ""Chicken Recipes - Allrecipes.com""  and the related url is  ""https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CB0QFjAAahUKEwiIkbja3-vGAhURLogKHTHrDVo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fallrecipes.com%2Frecipes%2Fmeat-and-poultry%2Fchicken%2F&ei=AfutVciMKJHcoASx1rfQBQ&usg=AFQjCNEwNMuTd_uFKv4L364k_LaiiZbILA&sig2=95EdmDhAN82KBWLYw-PJyQ&bvm=bv.98197061,d.cGU""  I'd like my code to be able to look at the source element for the first page ( ultimately I would want it to do it for all pages for whatever given search) of the search, grab the title, hyperlink the url to the title, and place it in a cell and down a column- one cell per hyperlinked-search result.  I think you understood my question the first time around, but I'm having difficulties knowing what to do with your code- sorry I just got back in to VBA."

I went to that chicken Google search result page (I use Chrome), Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, toggle back to Excel, Ctrl-V. I was surprised what I found. You can also Paste Special Match Destination Formatting, which puts readable text onto Excel. Worth a try for you to see if that gets you anywhere closer to your goal."

Compare this line's timstamp to a user entered timestamp (or set when you open the file), this makes it quicker to resume the operation in the case that a couple of workbooks can't be modified because someone has them open.

excel,3dnr6h,Jerrymeyers11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:40:55 2015 UTC,Will each person's sheet have only the most recent week's numbers?  Or will the current week's numbers be added as a new row?
excel,3dnr6h,gregcron,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"Ah. Yes, each sheet will contain only the numbers for the current week."
excel,3dnr6h,gregcron,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:05 2015 UTC,":/  In that case, I think you'd have to manually calculate the monthly totals for your report, since they'll be in separate files.  It is possible to pull from other files, but with sending out the template, etc., I don't think it's a good approach here.  You might consider simply adding a row for 'Week 2' for the new input on each sheet, that way you have it all in one place.  I think that'd make it much easier to make the calculations."

excel,3dnr6h,fuzzius_navus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.   If you do decide to add rows for new weeks, take a look at using the 'lock cells' function.

excel,3dmjdn,LaughingRage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"The way the formula pulls the first instance, second instance, etc is by using the ROW(1:1) function.  In the formula, ROW(1:1) returns the number 1, telling the rest of the formula to pull the first instance.  When this formula is pasted down one row, it turns to ROW(2:2) which returns a 2; pulling the second instance.  If your data is filtered and you paste over the filtered data, the formula will adjust itself including that filtered row.   For instance, if you have the rows 1 and 3 showing but row 2 is hidden/filtered and then you put the formula =ROW(1:1) in the first row, if you copy and paste that same formula down to row 3 the formula will change to =ROW(3:3).  Even though row 3 looks like the second row because its right after the first, Excel will still count your hidden/filtered row."

That said, just as a spreadsheet, LibreOffice Calc is slower than Excel, lacks PowerBI, and lacks much of Excel's more sophisticated pivot table functionality, lacks structured table referencing.  OTOH, LibreOffice Calc is more capable in some areas. Calc offers optional regular expression support in MATCH, ?LOOKUP, SEARCH, and FIND, though sadly not in SUBSTITUTE. This makes some text processing much easier than in Excel. Calc's INDIRECT function just returns values rather than range objects; it works against closed workbooks. Calc can handle multiple open files with the same base filename. Calc also provides absolute and relative worksheet referencing in 3D references; Excel only provides absolute worksheet referencing.
