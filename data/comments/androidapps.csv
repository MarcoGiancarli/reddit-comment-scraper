They're solid, look nice, and have quite a good number of options ranging from changing up the interface to the way the game looks to audio. You could go for the free ones too, but you'll find that they tend have poor ratings and don't work so great or easily.  Also DraStic DS emulator is an awesome DS emulator if you're interested ($6, but there's a demo to test it out. If you're interested in a PlayStation emulator I suggest FPse for Android. It's about $4 but it's wonderful. There's also a PSP emulator if you want to give that a shot. It's called PPSSPP. I haven't had the chance to use it myself since ISO files for PSP games are like 1 to 3 or so GBs in size.   And as for ROMs themselves one of the best sites is gonna be emuparadise.com. If you're wanting to play Smash Bros. don't count on playing the GameCube or Wii version. The only emulator out that can do that is Dolphin Emulator and it's in alpha phase so it doesn't run all that great. But if you get N64oid (which I recommend, but you can get Mupen64 off the app store which should suffice) you can play Smash Bros. 64 at least."

For this reason this is a kind of app I recommend whenever someone runs out of storage.  There are other apps that do the same thing, both free and paid. A good option I often hear about is SD Maid - but you need the paid version to be able to clean as much as CM (which can be worth it, but not for everyone)...

And, if someone says that it is due to it being a credit for something then the same thing.  It is theft to remove it.  If a mechanism isn't set up to allow you to take the money out instead of buying more of their services, it is theft.  It doesn't matter how common it is and that you have become used to it happening to you.  It boils down to they took it so it is theft."
