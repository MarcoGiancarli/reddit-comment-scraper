It might be difficult to put something the size of the Galactica into a stable orbit and probably more effort than its worth. The finale isn't about he ships though, it's about a fresh start. What's the use of having the ships up there? Wouldn't that just raise a lot of questions that people aren't prepared to answer? And it's not as though humanity can be trusted with that much of a jump in technology that would come from finding ships like that and taking a good look at them. That would lead to the Cylon problem even quicker.   I do believe though that it would probably be possible to place them into a stable orbit for a long time. Although there are a lot of satellites that have had their orbits degrade so badly that we've had to bring them down and crash them. So really I don't know. Maybe someone with more knowledge can chime in."

BSG,3dpyb7,EvitGrey,4,Sat Jul 18 08:38:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually played the board game but I just read through the manual and did a little poking around, and the general consensus seems to be that at the very least you should watch the miniseries that starts the show.  Mainly for the reason that you will recognize all the characters and have a general understanding of the plot while playing the game.  There are expansions for the game (Pegasus, Exodus, and Daybreak) that do spoil some plot points from the later seasons.  (Pegasus spoiling season 2, and Exodus and Daybreak spoiling both seasons 3 and 4.)  There are also minor things like some characters military rank that change throughout the series, but I think that's pretty minor.  You should also be careful of any flavor text on the cards in the game as they might spoil character specific plot points, but this isn't central to the game.    The Miniseries runs 3 hours which were broadcast in 4 ""episodes"" so I don't think it's too much of an investment to avoid any spoilers.  That being said I think the spoilers would probably be minor, but for maximum enjoyment of the game I personally would want to have at least a cursory knowledge of the characters and the plot.  Also it's incredible and I would recommend anyone watch whether they are going to play the board game or not."
BSG,3dpyb7,SolvencyMechanism,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:01:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I did look up a recommended watching list but I'm a bit confused about one thing. I am using this website in order to know in which order to watch. For season 1 it starts with the episode entitled, ""33"" and ends the the episode entitled, ""Kobol's last gleaming part 2"". On netflix there is Battlestar Galactica (1978) which starts with, ""Saga of a Star World: Part 1"" and ends with ""The Hand of God"". Is 1978 and season 1 the same? If so, why are the names so different? If you know anything about this I would be very grateful for I am currently very confused."
BSG,3dpyb7,AdmSanctum,3,Sat Jul 18 20:15:18 2015 UTC,The only Battlestar Galactica on Netflix is the one from 1978/1980. The one you want to watch started in 2003. Unfortunately you have to watch it somewhere other than Netflix.

Playing the boardgame first will give away things about the overall dynamics of the show that I think you'd be better off not knowing. Going in blind massively enriches the experience, as it's a show where hardly anyone is safe, no taboo is sacred, and anything can happen. Even looking at DVD covers from the later seasons is too much of a spoiler fest for me.   I'm a little militant when it comes to avoiding spoilers, but I don't think I'm being unreasonable. I love BSG with a passion, and everyone I've suggested it to (even people who hate Sci Fi!) have binged the whole thing from start to finish after I convinced them to watch the miniseries and stop there if they didn't like it.   tl;dr: you don't have time to play board games if you haven't watched BSG yet"
BSG,3dpyb7,RelevantRoll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:42 2015 UTC,Haha okay. I have 2 weeks until my next board game night so that should be plenty of time to at least finish the first season.
BSG,3dpyb7,Eberon,2,Sun Jul 19 06:24:04 2015 UTC,"That boardgame is the first serious boardgame I ever played. It introduced me to the world of boardgaming, and it's still one of my favorites. It's also what introduced me to the show in general.  There's only one spoiler that affected me, and that's in the miniseries - one of the cards shows a picture of an as yet unrevealed cylon. The rest of the cards, while they could be seen as spoilers of the first season, are so abstract that you can't really place them. And because it's the players who determine whether you pass or fail, you don't know what happened in the show for sure. Playing the game for the first time after watching, though, is like playing a whole new game - all of a sudden the references make sense!  I would, however, steer clear of playing the expansions until you've seen the show. The events, again, aren't huge spoilers, but the character sheets state pretty clearly some of the main story lines for the characters. But once you've started watching, you won't be able to stop - it's addictive like that. So you'll be able to play the expansions soon!"

BSG,3dju11,k5josh,3,Fri Jul 17 05:11:25 2015 UTC,"Jumps have a max range- dictated by both computational limitations and drive. You can see it during the season three episode The Passage. It takes them two jumps to get through the radiated star cluster. Now combine that with a spool up time and having to recalculate the coordinates each jump and you have distance over time.   So presumably if the Galactica jumped non-stop with minimal spool time over a whole year, it would travel 1.6 million light years, which is roughly ten times the size of the Milky Way galaxy.  As where these guys got their actual numbers I'm not sure. But a good reference point is that the distance between New Earth and the Colonies is quite a bit less than 2000 light years, because the final five traveled there with subluminal speeds."

BSG,3d3jbc,trevdak2,6,Mon Jul 13 06:03:51 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I watched Caprica, so I'm glad to rewatch it here!  I felt like the Pilot was a pretty solid episode. It builds the BSG lore, but I don't feel like it really leans on it. I mean the only real direct connection we have is the Adamas, and once we saw that Joseph was a lawyer that defended the worst of the worst, we've exhausted all previous material on the Adamas and it's left completely open for the show to be creative.  This show doesn't really lend itself to the just-one-more episode nature of BSG. I think it's mostly because it's much less action and more drama and intrigue. But part of me wonders if I would have watched it, if I hadn't watched BSG first. I'd be curious to hear from anyone that might have watched Caprica first.  Either way, I love the closer look we get at the colonies before the fall. We only really get tiny glances in BSG. I like the fleshing out of the Tauron culture: Ha'latha, the tattoos, different customs, their own language. I like that they continue to show that the friction between different colonies and cultures. The hedonism of the V-world subculture is really interesting, kind of like the pre-flood description of humanity in the Bible. The colonials' perceptions of a single god are kind of funny, since we live in a world where monotheism is much more common than polytheism. Can you believe those STO terrorists have only one god that gets to call all the shots without any dissenting opinions? That's too much power for one god to handle. I also like they brought some completely new to the creation of cylons, Greystone's attempt to cheat death and bring back his daughter.  Ideas for weekly count - just throwing some out there, some are more interesting than others   Holoband establishing shots - you know with the green and orange lights flashing and the user's eyelids twitching. I have a feeling there will be a lot. Cigarettes smoked - I love that they have kind of a 50s yet futuristic vibe going, and if I remember right, this includes a lot of cigarettes being smoked throughout the series. Representations of Pyramid - shots of the stadium, equipment, sports memorabilia, mentions in dialogue, etc. I honestly don't know if this will be that common, but it could be. Battlestar acter reappearances - The Canadian acting pool is notoriously small so there are familiar faces that occur from time to time as different characters. A new one I noticed this time around is that Joseph Adama's mother-in-law Ruth is actually the same actor as one of the older member's of Baltar's cult, Lilly. She was the one who Baltar caught praying to the old gods after the raid by the Sons of Ares. This stat would be harder to keep track of but would be kind of fun. I can think of a couple others, and I'm sure there are more I didn't catch the first time around. Serge appearances/lines - mostly because I'm jealous I don't have an awesome robo-butler. Serge is the shit."

The V-Club is shot in the same location used the for the Opera House in BSG. Black gloves for grieving Taurons are some of the many cultural touchstones and world building this series does that I really love. Moore: Greystone was inspired by and is a mix of the various tech gurus of the day such as Jobs and Gates. These days you might include Elon Musk. Sasha Roiz, who plays Sam, is essentially this series version of Helo in the sense that the writers originally intend him to be a major part of the series. Like Tahmoh Penikett, he won the writers over with his performance and charisma so they found a way to work him into the series. I really like Agent Duram as a character. He seems to be coming from a genuine place in his desire to catch the terrorist and doesn't come off as cliche bad guy government agent. The swerve of the train explosion was pretty cool. Like BSG, Caprica subverts expectations and literally begins with a bang. We know from BSG colonials still harbor some racism and we see a lot more of that here. I always thought this was striking idea in light of the fact that its a gender neutral society. The yellow eye on the cylon was initially perplexing, but it set up the reveal of the red eye really well. Really cool moment seeing it change for the first time, even though it meant because thee Zoe avatar was the reason. The reveal of the Adams being the Adamas was nicely done, even if wasn't entirely a surprise. Loved hearing Bill Adama's theme play when Joseph revealed there true name to Willy. The most interesting thing I learned form the commentary was that, at this point in time, the colonies aren't united under one government. There is no President of the Twelve Colonies and right now, each planet essentially acts as it's own nation state.   Overall, I enjoyed the pilot. Good performances all around, even from Polly Walker whose character, Sister Clarice, I could never stand. I do love how different this series is from Battlestar, but I understand while some people at the time didn't go past the pilot. It's a much different type of show than BSG was. I haven't seen this nearly as often as BSG, and I don't remember a lot of specific events, so it will be nice to watch this without knowing every little beat that is to come.  Serge is my god now!"
BSG,3d3jbc,Plastic_Mouldsman,2,Sat Jul 18 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"So glad you're with us for Caprica to give us this kind of stuff. Keep up the good work, as usual your posts are fascinating as frak."
BSG,3d3jbc,lostmesa,3,Wed Jul 22 01:26:51 2015 UTC,Is this the very first episode? One a week for 77 weeks starting right now? I never see the first one in rewatch thread on any sub!

BSG,3d3jbc,BaltarForPresident,3,Mon Jul 13 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"First time watcher of Caprica, so I'm hoping the rules of no spoilers still apply..   My thoughts:   I always thought that the 'one true god' thing was an original idea from the mechanical Cylons that existed before the 12 Colonies? I know that two individual cultures can form the same ideas but it seems like too big of a coincidence to start the show off with something like that. Is there a reason for this? Don't tell me if I will get an answer for this in a future episode. I really love the different planet, different races thing. I kind of wish they explored this in the series more often. The whole Latin-American-Tauron Mafia was a pretty cool addition.  I learned in the regular series that Joseph Adama was a criminal defense attorney who represented the 'bad guys'. Here, the writers/producers are giving the reason why and I absolutely love that they're humanizing him.  I'm upset that I cheated by looking up the show up on IMDB and learning the (semi)-twist that it was the Adamas in this episode. Although I'd like to think I would've figured it out anyway with all the hints."
BSG,3d3jbc,MarcReyes,3,Wed Jul 15 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"the mechanical Cylons that existed before the 12 Colonies   Can you give an example of one of these Cylons?   The mechanical Cylons and the skin jobs (except for the Final Five) on BSG are all descendants of the mechanical Cylons that were made in the 12 Colonies. I think Ellen mentions that these Cylons already had monotheistic beliefs, like the Final Five. We hear about, but never see any of the mechanical cylons from before the 12 colonies (Kobol). We do know that the Final Five are descended from the mechanical Cylons created on Kobol, and they also are monotheists I believe."
BSG,3d3jbc,onemm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:23:54 2015 UTC,"We do know that the Final Five are descended from the mechanical Cylons created on Kobol, and they also are monotheists I believe.   The original Cylons from Kobol is where I thought the idea for a 'one true god' came from, but the more I think about the timeline of who and what comes first, the more confused I get so I'm probably wrong."
BSG,3d3jbc,lostmesa,2,Wed Jul 15 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"I tried to look it up on Battlestar Wiki but apparently it's too specific of a question. The line I'm thinking of would have been when Ellen is on the Basestar talking to Cavil. I thought she said that when they found the Colonial Centurions that they had already developed their own monotheism. The Final Five were monotheists or at least descendants of Monotheists because I thought the Thirteenth tribe built the the temple on the Algae Planet for the one true god. I could be wrong, but as far as I know, Cylons developed monotheism twice, independently."
BSG,3d3jbc,MarcReyes,2,Thu Jul 16 04:57:45 2015 UTC,"Really cool there is someone here who hasn't seen it yet. I look forward to your thoughts as always. Are you waiting a week between episodes to follow along with the rewatch, or are you binging them and just coming back after the fact?"
BSG,3d3jbc,MarcReyes,2,Sat Jul 18 01:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm watching them as the rewatch goes along, one week at a time. The reason why I've never seen The Plan or Caprica is because (unlike many people) I loved the ending of the fourth season and didn't want to ruin it or dilute it with an inferior product. So far, I've been very happy with what I've seen though."

I'd check ebay for what it would typically sell for.  The Galactica kit, I wouldn't personally pay more than $45 for, since that's what the Moebius Galactica kit goes for and it's newer and better than the Monogram one.

BSG,3cx6mf,RealJackAnchor,8,Sat Jul 11 15:53:06 2015 UTC,It almost sounds like you skipped the second season.
BSG,3cx6mf,Dose_of_Reality,3,Sat Jul 11 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by your description as well.    Questions:  1.) Was there an election going on for President of the Colonies and staying at the planet or moving on in space is a divisive issue?  2.)  Was Starbuck with Anders?  3.)  Has the show introduced a perspective for the Cylon units still on Caprica?  If the answers to the three are Yes, that you should be at about the end of season 2.  The name of the episode is Lay Down Your Burdens.  You're at the cusp of a really good part of the series.  Don't start over, but maybe go back a couple of episodes to Captain's Hand or Downloaded."
BSG,3cx6mf,HoDoSasude,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"I looked around a bit. This was the last episode I watched.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Life_(Battlestar_Galactica)  I have no idea what was going on during it, and maybe a few episodes before that as well. I just remember they were on a planet and shit was weird."
BSG,3cx6mf,HoDoSasude,3,Sat Jul 11 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"Based on that, I assume the planet you are talking about is the algae planet in season 3. They went there because there was a food shortage, so the mission was to collect the algae to make food. You really should go back and watch the whole season 3 at least, because it seems you missed some critical details. Their presence (and what happens) on that algae planet is absolutely important to the plot."
BSG,3cx6mf,FTWinston,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"Right but I also thought there was something going on with a resistance, and people working together that hated each other beforehand. I think basically I was confused about the transition from season 2 to 3. There was some sort of resistance, and issues with Cylons taking over or something. It felt like there was a time jump in there (2 years maybe?) and I wasn't really understanding what happened to get to that point."
BSG,3cx6mf,kerelberel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"Season 2 ends with a presidential election and the discovery of the planet New Caprica. Season 3 continues that story of being there and resisting a Cylon occupation of New Caprica. I'd suggest you re-watch the two-part end of season 2, Lay Down Your Burdens Pt 1 and 2. Critical details there that set up the beginning of season 3."
BSG,3cx6mf,ukronin,3,Sat Jul 11 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"From your replies, it sounds like you saw the end of season 2, and then jumped to the middle of season 3.  That would be extremely confusing. The time jump happens right before the end of the last episode of season 2, so I suggest (possibly) watching the last episode of season 2 again, then going to the start of season 3.  The first 4 episodes of season 3 are really very top notch."

BSG,3c9xpa,microflops,9,Mon Jul 6 10:32:02 2015 UTC,"My response to any questions like this regarding prequels/viewing order, regardless  of tv, movies, books, etc., is to just watch in the order aired/published.  That's the order it was created in, and the order people originally watched/read it in, and later works will always be created and viewed in the context of earlier works, regardless of whether it's intended to be.  I wouldn't suggest anyone watch Caprica before BSG because Caprica was created in the context of BSG having already existed (even if it doesn't spoil anything or reference anything)."
BSG,3c9xpa,kengou,2,Mon Jul 6 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. I always suggest people go in the production order first, then watch however they like after they've seen it all in the order which the creators made it."

As with pretty-much any prequel there are references and subtleties in Caprica that only make sense when you've seen the original.

BSG is long enough ago that it maybe wasn't such a trope, but I see it all the time now. It's especially cheap when it's a character that never had much development, but is suddenly being built up just to try and milk the audience. BSG avoided that mostly, but I still reckon that's why your GF is picking up on these characters right before they die."

BSG,3c7oh3,jove12345,2,Mon Jul 6 00:21:37 2015 UTC,It's always weird watching the miniseries because there are so many people who don't make it till the end. It's like a ghost ship.
BSG,3c7oh3,Namelessjake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:27:31 2015 UTC,dude so many spoilers in this post
BSG,3c9jcn,1kon,6,Mon Jul 6 03:51:04 2015 UTC,"I would suggest conyinuing watching through the last season. It will clear up who is and isn't a cylon, at which point you may revisit your questions. There's so much speculation in your text above, I find it difficult to follow what you're even asking. You're basically asking us to spoil parts of season 4 for you."
BSG,3c9jcn,dissonance07,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:27:29 2015 UTC,Oh...so wait do I have to tag my speculation as spoilers as well?  And what about the actual detector?
BSG,3c9jcn,KingsElite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:13:41 2015 UTC,"Is there a good reason why a Six even showed up to the armistice station table in the first episode? For the life of me I cannot think of a reason why a Six and some Centurions had to show up, they blew up the station almost immediately.   Because it looked cool on screen. :P They were just trying to hook people at beginning with something that looked cool.  I think it's presumable that the Cylon detector works to some capacity if it was able to positively identify Boomer. But to the rest of your questions, you're pretty much just asking us to tell you what happens in the rest of the show. Do you not want to watch it anymore?"

BSG,3c9jcn,rustybuckets,2,Tue Jul 7 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't explain why he's so freaked-out when it shows red for Boomer. If he was just using the device as a smokescreen, it wouldn't have made him spaz like it did."

BSG,3c57cy,jove12345,17,Sat Jul 4 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"Well, think about what's going on in the world today... Sure, each country has its own language, but with the internet and global distribution of media, more and more people are speaking english. In another hundred years, some countries may switch to english entirely.  In the past few years, I've been to Iceland, Beligum, and the Netherlands, and only twice did I ever encounter someone who didn't speak english with some proficiency.  It's conceivable that a sufficiently advanced civilization with good communications system might also lose their differnet languages over time."
BSG,3c57cy,trevdak2,3,Sat Jul 4 23:40:06 2015 UTC,"That was something i considered but even within a relatively small country like the UK there are new dialects developing all the time. there are even new dialects developing in countries where English isn't spoken as a first language, even between internet communities new words and phrases appear. look at how hard minorities cling to their heritage in the form of language, the few i can think of off the top of my head are Welsh, Cornish, the different Gaelic dialects. The twelve colonies are descended from twelve ""tribes"" so i assume there is lots of heritage that they would want to hold onto that wouldn't be shared completely across 12 fully populated planets. I just find it odd that no one ever uses an expression and someone else is like what the hell does that mean. :)"
BSG,3c57cy,seishin17,4,Sat Jul 4 23:52:43 2015 UTC,"Cornish, Gaelic, Welsh, and others had centuries to develop without a globalized and interconnected environment like the colonies probably had. I'd like to believe their technological development happens pretty early in their history that they wouldn't have the extended separation the cultures within the British Isles had for the dialects to solidify and be pretty inflexible (or be subject to revivals like these dialects have had in Britain)."
BSG,3c57cy,seishin17,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"That's just the thought process I was having, with the addition that the colonies were relatively highly technologically advanced when they formed. They had interstellar travel and everything and so their development is conceivably such that they would have a globalized culture and a more uniform dialect planetwide."

BSG,3c57cy,Cash5YR,9,Sat Jul 4 23:53:34 2015 UTC,That slightly satisfies my nerd rage.
BSG,3c57cy,ety3rd,4,Sun Jul 5 00:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yep. It is kinda like ""Basic"" in the Star Wars universe, or ""Federation Standard"" in Star Trek. While each species or planet has different languages, etc. the larger group has selected a standard language, most likely a manufactured one like Esperanto, to communicate with each other."
BSG,3c57cy,a_caidan_abroad,2,Sun Jul 5 00:22:32 2015 UTC,This page lists all of the colonies and notes which ones have distinctive tongues (which we know from the shows and from released behind-the-scenes information): http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Colonies_(RDM)
BSG,3c57cy,henno13,2,Sun Jul 5 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"IIRC, there's French (Leonese in BSGland) written on a chalkboard in Roslin's classroom, and there are some Chinese characters on crates in the Resistance Webisodes."
BSG,3c57cy,crazyeasy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:19:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and ""English"" is portrayed in Caprica as Caprian. It's not unreasonable that Caprican became the lingua franca within the Twelve Colonies after colonization since Caprica was the political and cultural centre of the Colonies.   Of course, it's a bit weird that BSG never mentions this since Caprica obviously came after. I think it would've been cool to see multi-lingual colonials and holobands (we saw them used in a military capacity in Blood and Chrome, the military uses of that technology are too numerous to count)."
BSG,3c57cy,tnitty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:58:52 2015 UTC,There are different accents.  Balter is the best example. His home planet had a bit of a scottish flair with a (US Southern) stereotype. He said he had to change his accent in order for people to not judge him.
BSG,3c57cy,GoAvs14,5,Sun Jul 5 05:17:27 2015 UTC,TIt's shown in the series   I think this is about as close as the series comes to showing anything like that.
BSG,3c57cy,DJjaffacake,2,Sun Jul 5 01:43:18 2015 UTC,"""You know, I think I can"" is one of my favorite delivered lines in the series. Right behind it is when Coddle is giving Gaius a brain scan and Gaius looks up after moving in the machine, again, ""I'm not crazy"" with the buggy eyed intensity of someone who is trying to convince themselves they aren't."
BSG,3c57cy,The_Dingman,10,Sun Jul 5 17:46:01 2015 UTC,"But they all came from Kobol originally. Presumably, they're just speaking whatever Kobol's dominant language was."
BSG,3c57cy,TheAmazingBunbury,2,Sun Jul 5 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"They all came from Kobol, and they all settled with space travel technology, which you can assume to mean that they all communicated with each other from the beginning, encouraging at least a big part of the population to continue speaking the common tongue."
BSG,3c57cy,nthman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"The only plausible explanation is that before the evacuation the planet's culture had solidified into one cohesive whole. The cultural differences represented among the 12 different colonies must have happened after the exodus, but everyone already spoke the same tongue. It wouldn't make sense for different languages to develop among people groups who already speak the same language and have an analogue to the internet for communication. Some localized accents developed, but everyone can still understand each other."
BSG,3c57cy,colonelmcseabiscuit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:52:10 2015 UTC,I remember watching the original series and I want to say that in one of the first episodes they are looking for interpreters for one of the colonies survivors.
BSG,3c57cy,MTknowsit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:33:19 2015 UTC,"If you look closely at the chalkboard in Roslin's school on New Caprica, there's a bit of French verb conjugation.

BSG,3c57cy,Jaraus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:45:02 2015 UTC,Fiction also requires some greasing of the skids to operation proficiently.

BSG,3c57cy,bowtiesarcool,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:35:52 2015 UTC,Well there were chinese characters on a container in new caprica. It can be assumed that they so have other languages but appearantly they weren't popular
BSG,3c5c1m,SaturnApollo34,5,Sat Jul 4 23:06:59 2015 UTC,Because then the story wouldn't be about man vs. machine.
BSG,3c5c1m,tyme,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:20:56 2015 UTC,"The humans on the 12 colonies have advanced space travel and robotics, but it think they might not have made any big technological jumps since they left kobol and the majority of their sci-fi tech has been passed down to them. They aslo made the cylons which probably put a damper on cybernetics research in general. But medical technologies in BSG seem to be on par with real life or even a little behind at this point so i doubt they could or would cyborg up their marines even if they knew about the skinjobs."
BSG,3c5c1m,jove12345,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:38:00 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem is resources.  Remember, the Colonials didn't discover that Cylons had humanoid models until the Fall and when the Fleet was on the run.  Even if someone had the idea, they were busy enough just trying to get food and fuel for themselves.  They probably wouldn't have been able to R&D cybernetic implants and such."

The Blu-ray are surprisingly grainy but still great quality and the audio is amazing if you have a nice theater setup.
BSG,3bl3ks,crunchthenumbers01,-1,Tue Jun 30 12:43:02 2015 UTC,They have other websites for that.
BSG,3blnmb,trevdak2,7,Tue Jun 30 05:46:45 2015 UTC,"What I found fascinating about the Plan was how impromptu the Cylon's much-vaunted 'plan' really was. They were literally making it up as they went along.  Also best line of the movie imo: ""His jacket was burgundy. This is teal."""
BSG,3blnmb,lazerbullet,3,Thu Jul 2 09:24:28 2015 UTC,"""Well, I've got another jacket for you..."""
BSG,3blnmb,MarcReyes,2,Thu Jul 2 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"I liked the line(s) between Cavil and Number 4: ""She's beneath him."" ""Not necessarily."""
BSG,3blnmb,onemm,2,Fri Jul 10 04:06:03 2015 UTC,Think that line suffered on account of Stockwell's weird overacting.
BSG,3blnmb,lazerbullet,4,Fri Jul 10 10:35:41 2015 UTC,"So if you've seen my comments for past episodes, you'll notice that I love every time Dean Stockwell is on screen as Cavil and this movie is driven by not just one but two Cavil's. It's almost as if this was made specifically for me, so of course I love The Plan.  The two Cavil's featured here were referred to by the crew as F Cavil and C Cavil, with the letters standing for Fleet and Caprica respectively, so that's how I'll refer to them here.  In addition to being Cavil heavy, another reason I liked this movie was because we got to see the cylons fleshed out a bit more, particularly the Simons, who I'd argue was probably the cylon model about which we knew least. We also get more confirmation how far down the cylon totem pole the Dorals are, so much so that they are doing what they consider to be centurion work.   ""Be prepared for some very sticky hugs."" Right off the bat we're getting some great Cavil lines and he's got a lot of great darkly humorous lines in this. I loved his line to Shelly after telling her, ""Very smart Six... Or maybe its the glasses."" Love the callback to season one when Cavil introduces himself to Ellen as a 'Mysterious Stranger,"" which is what Ellen tells everyone when asked who rescued her back in ""Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me down."" Who would've guessed that the basestars are shaped that way so that they can pivot in order to become aerodynamic when entering an atmosphere. We never stop learning something new about the cylons. Love they whole Attack on the Colonies sequence. The editing, the music, the VFX, everything. It all flows so well together and made the attack seem as epic and catastrophic as it was. The nukes falling down, snapping open to reveal the nukes, then snapping open again to reveal even more was intense. I also loved finally seeing what we only heard about back in the miniseries. The cylon virus literally just turning off the battlestars, raptors, and vipers. Also, a particularly gruesome shot was of the centurions executing people still trapped in their cars on the highway. My second favorite cavil moment is from this. It's his first scene with Simon where all his anger and frustrations are unleashed. It's like he is pacing like a tiger when he is listing how all the cylons have let him down and goes to show how quickly he can go from sarcastic to frightening in a single moment. Again, Stockwell is so fascinating to watch, specifically in scenes like this. I loved the kiss between Tyrol and the woman. It never felt romantic to me, as Tyrol says, but more a symbol of acknowledgement of these two people commiserating over their situation's and how it bonds them in some way. In the commentary, writer Jane Espenson called it a non-romantic romance. The kiss is a kiss of understanding. Loved the juxtaposition of F Cavil killing the kid (""Friends can be dangerous things"") and C Cavil not killing Kara. I think that the two are going through similar circumstances with their fellow cylons expressing the love they've developed for the humans, but clearly go in different directions when presented an opportunity to either embrace it or reject it. C Cavil sees the bigger picture and chooses peace whereas F Cavil also sees it, but chooses to literally kill the symbol of peace sitting next to him. The two Cavils meet up on Galactica, but its altered from how it went down in the season two finale. If you remember, F Cavil went along with truce and seemed to have prior knowledge of it but the retcon still leaves things a bit unclear. If F Cavil was no longer aware of the truce, what does he mean by the line ""Unlike you, we can admit our mistakes""? C Cavil doesn't believe that the destruction of the colonies was a mistake, so I'm curous why they left that line in and yet changed so much else about the scene. I mean, even Laura is written out of the scene in this new version. I liked this movie overall, but this scene still doesn't make much sense to me. Cavil was always shown to be rude to the centurions, which we see again here even  from a newly enlightened C Cavil, but I only just now realized its probably because Cavil is envious of the centurions. After he is what he desires most. To be a cold, hard, machine made of metal and wires and gears. ""There's a 140 foot launch tube, we may die of our injuries before we get to the vacuum"" Cavil is the worst shoulder to cry on, even to himself. I love it. That whole last scene in the launch tube between the Cavils is perfect. Stockwell plays the moment so well, even more impressive since he's acting against himself. I'm not really sure how to express how much I love that scene. It's so well written and acted and directed and shot and edited. And it ends with Cavil finally getting to feel the winds of a supernova flowing over him.   A few interesting things learned form the commentary:   Frank Darabount was supposed to direct this and ""Islanded in a Stream of Stars"" but had to bow out, which is how Eddie was tasked with directing both. The rubble where Ellen is found is actually the hanger deck set after it was torn down. There were talks of doing a few more movies after this but they died down and it became that this would be the last time they shoot anything on the BSG set. When casting the boy who seeks refuge in Cavil's place, they intentionally wee looking for someone who looked like a young Dan Stockwell from The Boy With Green Hair."
BSG,3blnmb,MarcReyes,2,Thu Jul 2 00:59:32 2015 UTC,Do you know what their other movie ideas were?
BSG,3blnmb,skunk_funk,2,Sun Jul 5 04:30:26 2015 UTC,No. They only mention that two or three more were planned and that the writers had laid out a loose plan on what they would be about.
BSG,3blnmb,MarcReyes,2,Sun Jul 5 04:33:40 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat we're getting some great Cavil lines   My favorite Cavil line from this episode is when he's talking to Anders after he lost Kara. Anders says: ""Seems like I never sleep anymore."" and Cavil responds: ""I know the feeling."" This, of course, is a reference to Cavil's removing the necessity for sleep from his programming (he mentions it on the Basetar to Ellen in season 4 but I can't find the episode). It's such a subtle line and delivered so dryly that it's very easy to miss. I watched this episode with a friend and he was really confused why I laughed so hard and I had to pause to explain.      Love the whole Attack on the Colonies sequence. The editing, the music, the VFX,   I was gonna mention that I loved this in my own post. I especially loved the shot of the first bomb dropping; it was beautiful.     I loved the kiss between Tyrol and the woman. It never felt romantic to me,   Agree completely. There was definitely no romance in this and I'm so happy about it. Not every great male-female relationship (not that their particular relationship was 'great') has to be romantic, and I wish there was more relationships like this in TV/movies/literature. It was almost like a bro hug or a brother-sister kiss on the cheek. It was an understanding between two people that have been through the same tough stuff and appreciate each other.     ..you'll notice that I love every time Dean Stockwell is on screen..   ..some great Cavil lines..  My second favorite cavil moment is from this...Again, Stockwell is so fascinating to watch...  Stockwell plays the moment so well...It's so well written and acted...   You barely ever mention Dean Stockwell in your reviews. I think he's fantastic (especially in this movie) and you should really look into him. You might like him. Seriously though, he was incredible in this, as usual. You've converted me to the Church of Stockwell. Praise Dean.  edit: formatting"
BSG,3blnmb,onemm,2,Fri Jul 10 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"I especially loved the shot of the first bomb dropping; it was beautiful.   ... in it's horror. I loved that shot shot so much.   This, of course, is a reference to Cavil's removing the necessity for sleep from his programming   Holy crap! I've actually never put that together! Nice catch! I believe the episode would have been No Exit.   You barely ever mention Dean Stockwell in your reviews. I think he's fantastic (especially in this movie) and you should really look into him.   Ha! That gave me a good laugh!"
BSG,3blnmb,MarcReyes,2,Fri Jul 10 15:52:26 2015 UTC,"Love they whole Attack on the Colonies sequence. The editing, the music, the VFX, everything. It all flows so well together and made the attack seem as epic and catastrophic as it was.    A part of me wishes that we had this awesome opening sequence during the mini-series, but I think it would not have been nearly as powerful as it was after the series had ended. Superb production all around."
BSG,3blnmb,lostmesa,4,Wed Jul 15 03:47:01 2015 UTC,"I just finished my first watch of the series yesterday. Incredible series. Despite the grumbling I've seen on the internet, I absolutely loved the ending. I think it worked much better for this series than a ""hard"" scifi type ending would have worked. I was all in on the mysticism.   All that said, The Plan sucked. It was boring and I couldn't wait for it to end. It didn't flesh out the cylon perspective so much as it crushed it. Twas better left with a little mystery. Made Cavil look a fool."
BSG,3blnmb,skunk_funk,3,Sun Jul 5 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"The thing I don't like about ""The Plan"" is that Cavil ends up looking like a complete dumbass. Like his plan all along was to make the Five admit they were wrong about humans by... killing all the humans (and the Five)? That's just insane nonsense.  Yeah, it's sort of explained in Cavil's dialogue with Anders, in which he's kind of baffled by Anders saying that something being dead doesn't mean you stop loving it -- but it's almost unbelievable that Cavil could be hung up on that.  I would buy it more if Cavil's plan all along had been to let a small group of humans survive, ensure that the Five were among that group (though of course it was entirely luck -- or God I suppose -- that the Five survived the attack and were on the fleet), and then force the Five to watch as humans tore each other apart because of their innate greed, jealousy, lack of trust, etc. I could buy that. The Five would die, and maybe it would become clear that their love for humanity was entirely misplaced, maybe.  But instead, Cavil was evidently planning the destruction of the Fleet all along, and he and the other Cylons just kept screwing it all up or getting beat by the Colonials.  Also it explains a lot of stuff that didn't need explaining. Like the Six that accused Baltar of betraying the Colonies got away because Cavil was hiding behind some boxes and was able to secret her away? C'mon now we don't need that."
BSG,3blnmb,zuludown888,2,Tue Jul 7 07:35:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe his plan was, let the Five live with the humans where (according to him) they will run into all the bad sides of humanity. He thought, after they died, they would wake up with their real memories + the Colonial memories, and so would look at their time with the humans as a bad time. Because of whatever they may have experienced. When he was talking with Anders, he already realized that just by living with them, Anders was happy. His plan was already starting to fail right there and then.  Basically it's like this. He wanted to put the Five in a situation he deems negative (living with humanity), but they are supposed to see the negative sides after they are removed from that situation. Right after removing them from that situation (the destruction of the colonies), they were supposed to look at that situation and see it for what it really is (to him): lies, hate, murder, whatever negative things humans can do. But they experienced so many good things and he didn't anticipate that because of his own jealousy and hate."
BSG,3blnmb,kerelberel,2,Wed Jul 8 08:44:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Cavil just ended up looking pretty clueless. And it was clearly a 'plan' the writers had made up for him after the fact."
BSG,3blnmb,lazerbullet,3,Fri Jul 10 10:35:16 2015 UTC,"Progress reports arriving: The farms of Aerilon are burning, the beaches of Canceron are burning, the plains of Leonis are burning, the jungles of Scorpia are burning, the pastures of Tauron are burning, the harbors of Picon are burning, the cities of Caprica are burning, the oceans of Aquaria are burning, the courthouses of Libran are burning, the forests of Virgon are burning, the colonies of man lie trampled at our feet.    This whole sequence gave me chills. I know it spoils the identity of the humanoid cylons, but I kind of wish this scene was in the mini-series. Maybe remove the humanoid cylons and only have it spoil the existence of hybrids, which would be confusing and mysterious. The ash corpses were also eerie, but awesome. I honestly don't know that we ever see much of the carnage from the during the mini-series so actually seeing ghoulish remains makes it feel more real to me. I liked getting a glimpse of a lot of the colonies as well. Sam watching the mushroom clouds from the mountains was an eerie scene. I've always wondered how it would feel to witness something like that."
BSG,3blnmb,BaltarForPresident,2,Mon Jul 13 08:25:15 2015 UTC,"This was my first time watching The Plan so I had quite a few thoughts, unfortunately my first post got accidentally deleted so... I'm gonna simplify it to what my reptilian brain remembers, not out of convenience for anyone reading but because I can't remember anything else.  Not like anyone's gonna see this shit anyway; I'm like a week and a half late.   What I loved:   Nudity Hear me out before you judge me. It's more the artistic freedom that I enjoy. I've always told people that I wish this show was on HBO, not necessarily because I love to see tits every episode, but because I'd like for the director/producer to have that option. For this same reason, I would've liked to eliminate the word 'frak'. If you like the word, that's fine, but I felt like some scenes were (almost) ruined because they had to use this silly word 'frak' instead of fuck. So many scenes could've been so much more powerful and emotionally charged if 'fuck', 'bitch' etc. (use your imagination) were used instead of these cover up words. The only time I ever cringe when I get new friends to watch this show is when they use 'frak' the first couple times (EDIT: That being said, I've used the word 'frak' many times and will continue to do so because I love this series, I just wish we could've used the real word). You get used to it, that's true, but it's not the same. It takes you out of the moment in the beginning, before you're used to it. So yea, the cursing and the adult content in general is really what I'm talking about. I don't mind a particularly gruesome death scene as long as it's well done. I'm a bit confused why nudity was the only 'adult content' in this episode but, it was fun nonetheless.  Also, going back to the nudity, there is not one heterosexual male in the world that wouldn't love to see any one of the leading ladies in this show naked (Number 6, Starbuck, Number 8) and (I'm assuming) there's not one heterosexual female that wouldn't love the same for some of the men (Lee, Helo, Anders). Fresh Storylines I really liked the storylines that weren't just exposition-y flashback material. I loved the Fleet Cavil's storyline with the child.  As /u/marcreyes already mentioned, the Simon addition was phenomenal, and I would've loved it if we got more of this during the actual seasons of the show. I wish there were more of these new storylines and less of the flashback sequences to be honest, but I know that the purpose of the movie was to kind of wrap everything up, so I understand. I guess I was just fiending for more BSG.   What I disliked:   Unnecessary Explanations Again, someone mentioned this already, but I had to put it on my list. I felt like some of the stuff that was said, was better left unsaid. I know the point of this movie was to answer all the questions that people might've had, but some of the stuff felt forced. For example, when 6 is greeted on Caprica by a mysterious person we find out it's Cavil. I watched BSG years ago and this is the first time I'm watching the plan, and I gotta say: I LIKED NOT KNOWING. There's something beautiful in the theorizing and discussion that comes from not understanding everything and I think that's why I never watched this movie in the first place. I couldn't help but be a little disappointed in getting explanations for some of this stuff that I never needed explanations for.  Boomer This is the only thing about the movie that truly upset me and comes very close to pissing me off. I always had this idea that Boomer was a sleeper agent who was programmed to do certain things at certain times, and I legitimately felt terrible for her throughout the series. She always seemed so real when I watched the first and second season, then they reveal that she knew who she was the whole time?! I hope this was a last-second-written-twist that barely made it,  because for four seasons I believed Boomer was a victim. The twist that she knew who she was and what she was the whole time is soap opera-esque badly written.  Based on what I've seen, I refuse to buy that she knew exactly what she was doing, and I'm gonna assume The Plan didn't happen. At least Boomer's part of The Plan.    Overall opinion  I liked it. Didn't love it but liked it. I've held out on watching it this long because (Iwas one of the seemingly few who) actually loved the end of season 4 and didn't feel like it could be approved upon with a movie. I loved some things that I listed above and only hated one thing (Boomer's story), so overall it was a success for me. It felt at times like the filmmaker was just going through a checklist of questions the fans had and checking them off one at a time as the story progressed, and because of that it felt really sloppy. The ending gave me goosebumps though. The Cavil speech from the fourth season mixed with the imagery was great. So overall enjoyable movie. But completely unnecessary.   edit: Again, ... Again, ..."
BSG,3blnmb,onemm,2,Fri Jul 10 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"RE: Nudity and adult content: If this show were on now, I don't think they would have shied away from nudity and might have just let them say ""fuck,"" albeit we'd hear that phrase far less than we do with the freedom that comes with an imaginary expletive. Both of these things are common now a days, even on cable, but keep in mind that Battlestar was the first of it's kind. It led the way for modern shows to get as dark and mature as they are now because it opened the door for that kind of storytelling on TV. Katee Sackoff once expressed similar ideas to this stating that of the show were on now, it'd probably would be winning awards and pushing the mature content pretty far than they could when it was on. I agree with that thought, but we wouldn't have gotten there if something hadn't opened that door and it was BSG that did that for every other show that followed it.  RE: Boomer: The theme of the movie is ""Love outlast death"" and that because Cavil didn't account for the love that the cylons felt for humanity was ultimately why the plan to completely eliminate them was doomed to fail. With Boomer, I think what they were going for was that Boomer was aware of what she was, but when she was human she began to fall in love with Tyrol and humanity in general and that love seeped it's way into her cylon half, slowly convincing her that they should be left alone. She had to turn herself into a machine in order to kill Adama but still fails at that because her human side prevented her from fatally wounding him. As a cylon, she realizes this and expresses this idea to Cavil which is when he realizes she's lost to his cause so he leaves her as a human.  Still, I think I agree with you that it's much more powerful the way it appears to be in the series, where she fully believes herself human but has no accounting of what happens when her cylon half is switched on.  I said I love this movie in my own post, and I do, but I do realize that it's definitely not without its faults. Which is why, if you're a completest and want to watch all of this era of BSG, I always suggest doing so after No Exit because it fits in well thematically there and also lets you end the series on the great finale Daybreak. I've also always like the idea of BSG technically beginning and ending with what amounts to two big movies."
BSG,3blnmb,MarcReyes,3,Fri Jul 10 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"Both of these things are common now a days, even on cable, but keep in mind that Battlestar was the first of it's kind   I believe Twin Peaks (early 90s), The Wire and Sopranos (early 00's) were similar in that they didn't shy way from showing dark and bleak things and themes."
BSG,3blnmb,kerelberel,2,Sat Jul 11 09:58:21 2015 UTC,"This is very true, and you also have to remember that 2/3 of those shows were on HBO where dark themes aren't frowned upon. This is exactly what I meant when I said I wished it was on that network. Seriously, can you imagine BSG on HBO? It would've been insanely good (not so say it wasn't good on SyFy, but it could've been so much more)."
BSG,3blnmb,onemm,2,Sun Jul 12 02:09:32 2015 UTC,"RE: Boomer :  After I've had a day to digest it all, I don't think I hated this storyline as much as I did originally, but I still don't like it. For multiple years and multiple rewatches, I always assumed Boomer was innocent and had a lot of sympathy for her. It was one of those emotionally gray areas where you don't know who to root for. The Plan changed this about Boomer, and not in a good way."
BSG,3blnmb,onemm,2,Sun Jul 12 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"In your mind, how did her programming work? Did you think they made her specifically for her trash as a sleeper agent? To me, before I saw this, she knew what she was, knew what she'd be tasked for, then put into sleeper agent mode and left to her own devices except for when she was switched on to sabotage the fleet. The problem came when she fell in love with Tyrol, Adama, and her human side. Her love for those aspects of her life grew so much that when she finally realized what she was, it tore her up."
BSG,3blnmb,MarcReyes,2,Sun Jul 12 02:18:15 2015 UTC,"I always assumed that (like the Final Five) she was programmed to just wake up one day and believe she was completely human. I thought the Cylons that were hidden in the fleet could covertly turn her on/off and give her orders without her ever knowing.   Knowing this, the moments when she seemed so confused and conflicted seemed really powerful to me, because she didn't have any control over what she did. According to The Plan though, she knew exactly what she was doing and so these same scenes (I think) will lose a lot of their emotional depth. But now that I'm thinking about it, maybe this fact will add some depth. I guess I have another reason to rewatch the series. Gods, every time I finish it, I tell myself I'm gonna stop watching for a while. This is my fourth time watching and my second in a row. All this has happened before and all this will happen again."
BSG,3blnmb,onemm,2,Sun Jul 12 02:44:44 2015 UTC,"Gods, every time I finish it, I tell myself I'm gonna stop watching for a while. This is my fourth time watching and my second in a row. All this has happened before and all this will happen again.   Ha! Yeah, never works it that way, eh?"
BSG,3blnmb,MarcReyes,2,Sun Jul 12 03:04:13 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression Boomer knew what she was doing when she was with Cavil, but when she changed to her Colonial side, she didn't retain the memories of her Cylon time.   I think this was the intention because a key question in BSG about Cylons and their memories is identity. Who is that particular eight? Does she identify as Boomer or as the Cylon before she was planted? Are those two mutually exclusive or is she both? Are both sides part of the persona 'Boomer/8/whatever you wanna call her'?  Eventually that turns out to be true, once she downloads to a new body she gets back all her memories, Cylon and Colonial. Both sides became one. Slavoj Zizek mentions something about multiple identities or personalities, it's in the book Battlestar Galactica and Philosophy - Mission Accomplished or Mission Frakked Up. I have it by my side but I can't find the relevant quote right now. Maybe I'll look into it later.  I don't know much about schizophrenia but isn't the same happening there? A different personality develops which exhibits sides of that person he or she normally doesn't want or can't show. Those sides reveal themselves by splintering the personality. Maybe Boomer wanted both, to be part of Cylon and Human society. Just like that Simon."
BSG,3blnmb,kerelberel,2,Sat Jul 11 09:55:30 2015 UTC,"You have some really interesting insight.. I never thought about a personality disorder with the Cylons but I guess it makes sense. The way she's talking, it seems almost obvious..    t's in the book Battlestar Galactica and Philosophy - Mission Accomplished or Mission Frakked Up.   I had no idea this existed. Is it worth the read?"
BSG,3blnmb,onemm,2,Sun Jul 12 02:14:39 2015 UTC,I got the insights from that book ;) And it's worth a read yes. There are several but the first two are the most popular ones: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=battlestar+philosophy
BSG,3blnmb,kerelberel,0,Sun Jul 12 07:42:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's like this for Boomer:  Colonial mode   memories made as a human false memories that she believes are real cylon memories that she can't access/doesn't know about   Toaster mode   memories made as a human false memories that she realizes are fake cylon memories that she has, including the plan to infiltrate and kill Adama   In Colonial mode she has no idea what she is about to do, I think she just has a weird sense of foreboding and she notices weird situations that come up like when she wakes up soaking wet with the C4 detonators.  In Toaster mode she is totally aware of all of her Colonial thoughts, motivations, and misgivings. She still has all the memories that she's made with the humans while in Toaster mode so in the end when she switches to Toaster mode to kill Adama, she holds back and doesn't shoot him in the head.  I think the evidence for this is in the series because she always seems confused by the memory gaps caused by being in Toaster mode: she wakes up confused with the C4, she finds the bomb under her seat in the raptor and feels confused that she had problems telling Crashdown that she found water, she seems super confused and seems to have no memory of just shooting Adama (I don't see how faking would help her so I assume her confusion is authentic).   Plus, in The Plan they added an additional way that she can be switched back and forth between Toaster and Colonial mode: the elephant figurine. When she has it, she has access to the Cylon memories, when it's taken away she loses access to those memories (elephants never forget their cylon memories?). The first scene when she sees it on her pillow (possibly put there by Cavil) she looks curious about it and slowly reaches to touch (I took this as her not recognizing the elephant figurine) and she instantly has a flashback to when she first became a sleeper agent. She then goes to discuss her attack plan with Cavil. Later after Sharon goes swimming Cavil comes and talks to her. After the discussion he takes the elephant and leaves. She sits there for a second, then all of a sudden stands up and looks around, completely alone, wet and confused, just like in the the season 1 episode. She lost the elephant so she lost access to her Cylon memories.  Another example, Cavil comes to visit her in prison he is holding the elephant in a way that would be visible to her. They have a conversation and Boomer recognizes him and understands that she is a cylon. However, after they're done with the discussion he puts it in his pocket, she looks confused for a second, and then says ""I don't want a priest"" like she doesn't recognize him.  TL;DR  I think that Boomer's character is consistent between the Plan and the series. Like in the series, Colonial mode Boomer is unaware but suspicious of her possible Cylon nature but secretly programmed to commit sabotage without retaining memories of it in Colonial mode. The Plan just shows that when she is being a saboteur in Toaster mode, she's completely aware of all of her cylon and human memories. Colonial mode Boomer was never complicit with the sabotage or attmepted murder of Adama. She even tried to kill herself for suspecting she was a Cylon (but apparently her autopilot prevented this). Toaster mode Boomer was aware of everything, but her affection for humans caused her to hold back and fuck up Adama's assassination."
BSG,3blnmb,BaltarForPresident,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:50:32 2015 UTC,"I thought Boomer's storyline was actually the most well done out of all The Plan. We were shown the sleeper side of her, and it didn't mess with any of the show's canon. Hopefully your explanation helps /u/onemm"
BSG,3blnmb,lostmesa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed with the direction they went with the Six model that accused Baltar of being a spy (from season one, Shelley Godfrey I think).   Just watching that episode I assumed it was Head six messing with Baltar. Then when he makes a step towards faith in God, the evidence against him is disproved, and Shelley Godfrey somehow disappears like she didn't exist though her glasses are left behind.

BSG,3bkwol,General_Revan,10,Tue Jun 30 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"The only way to answer this is to give some massive, kind of obvious, spoilers. Finish the season is all I can say."

BSG,3bkwol,Pfeffersack,8,Tue Jun 30 02:05:38 2015 UTC,Is fun. I would give my right nut to enjoy it again as someone who hasn't watched it.
BSG,3bkwol,ChriosM,7,Tue Jun 30 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"The jumps all have to be calculated by precise, complicated math from what I recall. The further away you are trying to jump, the more complicated it becomes. At the end of the miniseries that you should have watched before starting the regular first season (first season properly starts with the episode called 33), Adama admits to Roslin that he doesn't know where Earth is but if they are going to survive as a species they need something to survive for, something to keep them going. But even if he did know exactly where it was, the fleet would still have to make a series of jumps to get there as opposed to jumping straight there.  Edit: as for the question of why the Cylons don't jump their entire fleet to the colonial fleet when they make contact, that is what they generally try to do. They don't have FTL communications, however, so the Cylon Raider has to make positive contact with the colonial fleet and not get destroyed by the Galactica or her contingent of Vipers, and then jump back to its home Basestar and inform them of the colonial fleet position. Then the entire Cylon fleet (or at least the Basestar the Raider belongs to) has to spool up their FTL drives and jump back to where the colonial fleet was discovered and hope the colonials haven't already left in the couple of minutes all this takes."
BSG,3bkwol,ChriosM,2,Tue Jun 30 02:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yes but it seems to me like that would have been a massive priority for the fleet and that they would be working on it for a few weeks before they had the coordinates, but it seems like Adema said ""i know where our salvation is"" and then its been ignored entirely."
BSG,3bkwol,CowboyFlipflop,6,Tue Jun 30 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"I felt that Adama presented his knowledge of Earth's location as a series of markers along a road map as opposed to having the x, y, and z precise coordinates even though I don't recall anyone explicitly saying so. Maybe I just assumed as much since, as you point out, no one seems to question it. But everyone is pretty shocked by what happened to the colonies, and tends to keep fairly busy most of the time, so maybe they are just kept busy enough to not really get much of a chance to think about it."
BSG,3bkwol,Pfeffersack,3,Tue Jun 30 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"That explains it rather nicely, now it seems to make sense. Thanks for the help!"

BSG,3bitig,Defenestrationism,21,Mon Jun 29 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'll presume you've seen The Plan and Razor. If not, watch those.   Blood & Chrome is two hours, pretty decent. The use of CG sets allows it to have a scope we never got to see in BSG. The plot was a bit weak, with a twist that was a bit eye-rolling. I would love to have seen it as a series.  Caprica has a very different tone from BSG. It's more political, slow-burning. There are a lot of diverse threads going on, a lot of world-building, and not all of those threads are completely successful. There are a few characters who would have been better off as minor characters. It introduces a couple of things that are absolutely radical and excellent - most notably New Cap City - and improves dramatically in the second half as it finds its footing. Had it been renewed, the second season would likely have been excellent. Sitting through the slow parts of the series is worth the effort. There is a moment late in the season that threatened to shake the foundation of BSG.  Also: have you ever watched Star Trek: Deep Space Nine? It's where Ron Moore cut his teeth and tried out a lot of the things that were central to the success of BSG. The first couple of seasons are a little spotty, but overall I think it's even better than BSG."
BSG,3bitig,TheCheshireCody,7,Mon Jun 29 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"There is a moment late in the season that threatened to shake the foundation of BSG.   I know exactly what you're talking about. Well said.   Also: have you ever watched Star Trek: Deep Space Nine? It's where Ron Moore cut his teeth and tried out a lot of the things that were central to the success of BSG. The first couple of seasons are a little spotty, but overall I think it's even better than BSG.   I definitely second this recommendation. I just finished a partial rewatch of the entire show (skipped a few episodes here and there). The first couple of seasons are, like TheCheshireCody said, a little spotty, but it does an excellent job of having a large, overarching storyline (like BSG) while still focusing on single-episode issues like, well, pretty much every other Star Trek show."
BSG,3bitig,EVula,5,Mon Jun 29 22:21:27 2015 UTC,TheCheshireCody did a great job with this review all I can add is that Caprica gets even more compelling the more you watch it  Blood and Chrome is worth the watch but not a high point in the franchise

BSG,3bitig,XXLpeanuts,7,Mon Jun 29 20:05:22 2015 UTC,Absolutely. It was one of the few spin-off shows that was actually really good.
BSG,3bitig,UglierThanMoe,2,Mon Jun 29 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"If the show had the tone of the second half from the beginning it would have gone on for at least as long as BSG. Unfortunately, too many people had tuned out by that point. I think people not recognizing that it was Battlestar-related also hurt the show. Sure, Caprica was mentioned a lot in BSG, but a casual fan might not remember, and when SyFy is airing a half-dozen ambiguously-titled single-word shows like 'Haven', 'Sanctuary', and 'Eureka', a show with a name that isn't even a real word can cause people to not recognize it. Calling it Battlestar Galactica: Caprica would not be strictly accurate, but it would clue people in that it was the same universe."
BSG,3bitig,TheCheshireCody,2,Tue Jun 30 19:55:22 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more.
BSG,3bitig,UglierThanMoe,2,Tue Jun 30 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"Even more of a shame is that SyFy a few years earlier or even now would likely have given the show another shot. A few years earlier and they probably could have gotten a partner to defray the cost, like SkyTV did with the original show. 2010 was right after the re-branding, when the network heads were still more interested in doing Ghost Hunter marathons and airing anything with a badly CGI-ed shark in it. Now, the network seems interested in more high-concept Sci-Fi and is also willing to take some more risks on emerging shows."

It was actually very high quality and outstanding for what it was... that being a made for the internet webisode based free movie. They made it a pilot to pitch a new show and had it got picked... but it didn't. So they released a blu ray of it and yes it does not live up to BSG or Caprica but it's still very watchable.

BSG,3bi83l,ElGringoAlto,4,Mon Jun 29 13:00:20 2015 UTC,"You should absolutely watch the pilot as it's a fantastically fun show (it'll also answer your question) but basically they look exactly like humans. However, humans did not find out that there were new humanoid models (previously, they all looked like metal androids) until cylons attacked, causing mass extinction of the human race outside of the few survivors.   Yes, they are organic and yes, research is being done to find differences, but when you're constantly on the run for your life and without proper resources, it's hard to sit down and figure things out succinctly.  Also, the BSG board game is so damn fun and intense. I wish I got to play it more often."
BSG,3bi83l,Protanope,5,Mon Jun 29 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"It's never really definitively explains as far as I can recall.  But several differences are shown.... Cylons can directly interface with computers, they are stronger than humans, they can download memories, and be resurrected.  It's also implied they might have ""telepathic""/WiFi communication with each other  Personally I think they superficially identical to humans, but are build out of nano tech and not organic material.  The differences are likely at the cellular level."

BSG,3bi83l,Diablo_Cow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:52:18 2015 UTC,"Been a while since I watched the show so forgive me if I make any errors.  However from what I remember the humanoid cyclons are almost identical to humans in nearly every regard minus a protein/molecule or two in their hair/blood.  In real life in order to identify an unknown compound you'll run the select compound through a series of spectroscopes.  Mainly Proton NMR/CarbonNMR, IR, and visual/UV.  These tests tell you the composition and structure of a molecule.  Now as an undergrad biochemist, I personally find NMR analysis to be extremely difficult.  It is really easy to come up with a structure that is almost but not quite what you want and it takes a decent amount of checking and rechecking to verify.  If you have years of experience or a computer running the analyses for you then it'll be move faster and more accurate.   That said the human body has countless molecules and it would be extremely difficult even for a computer I'd wager to take an analysis of the entire chemical make up while only looking for one or two differences.  In the show Baltar makes a specific mention that each test takes roughly 12ish hours to complete.  So that leads me to believe the test he's running isn't necessarily the spectra tests, probably something else.  But the principle should still be the same."
BSG,3bi83l,orionsbelt05,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:56:17 2015 UTC,"At first it isn't clear whether Baltar actually wants to make a cylon detector or if the ""Six"" in his head is just messing with him by telling him to ask the admiral for a nuke. Then, when he builds the detector, it seems he actually made one because it works on Boomer within a few seconds. But then a few episodes later he claims (seemingly sincerely, to himself) that the tests would take about 11 hours for each person (no idea why he can't run more than one at once), so that eliminates the possibility of testing the whole fleet. But it still left the question of why he didn't at least test the high-ranking members of the fleet (President, Admiral, XO, CAG, etc.) so the whole cylon detector was just kinda... forgotten."
BSG,3bi83l,Diablo_Cow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:05 2015 UTC,Ahhh I forgot about that near instant one. The one that stood out most in my mind were the blood tests since that's closer to what I've used.  That said yeah no clue as to whats going on.  Doing a rerun so when I get there I'll take a closer look and see if there's anything I can recognize.    Tbh I doubt I'll see anything those spectra machines are really really expensive even for twenty year old ones so I doubt the crew would go out of their way to buy one for the sake of fidelity when you can easily just put a cover on another machine and just make it work.
BSG,3bi83l,orionsbelt05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:38:16 2015 UTC,"I had these questions up until the end of the series. The only logical conclusion I came up with is that the humanoid cylons are essentially mass-produced humans, created via a process similar to cloning instead of biological reproduction. They think and act differently, so the make-up of their minds is very different from a human's.  When you come down to it, our human brains are just a series of electronic signals producing thought and memory, and the humanoid cylon models are essentially clones with biological ""programmed"" brains."

BSG,3bcden,bl0rk,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:07:43 2015 UTC,I don't think Caprica ever spoils BSG. (I could be wrong but I don't remember anything.) So you can also follow the upcoming Caprica rewatch if you want.
BSG,3b58or,Robotic_Potato,6,Fri Jun 26 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the last time I heard heard of someone excitedly introduced to the series via the old series. Usually it's via the '04 series. Cool to hear.  You can watch the re-imagined series next. To the right you'll see a link to the rewatch threads that we recently completed. It lists the episodes, webisodes, and TV movies in the original production. Follow that and you'll be good. Above it is also a link to an alternate viewing order. After that you can move on to Caprica, a prequel series to the re-imagined and finish it off with BSG: Blood and Chrome which is set during the first Cylon War."
BSG,3b58or,MarcReyes,2,Fri Jun 26 02:49:50 2015 UTC,Is it bad to start in the original series? I just like to start things from the beginning
BSG,3b58or,TheRowenBowen,3,Fri Jun 26 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"The new series is REALLY DEEP though. Old series was fun, but the new one will make you think."
BSG,3b58or,MarcReyes,4,Fri Jun 26 19:10:24 2015 UTC,Not at all. You just don't usually hear people starting from there often.
BSG,3b58or,trevdak2,6,Fri Jun 26 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"If you finished the OS and G1980, try the reimagined series. It's a completely different show, but oh so good."

BSG,3b58or,Schnabeltierchen,3,Fri Jun 26 13:22:11 2015 UTC,"Oh.. the original series. Well that was unexpected.   But seriously the reimagined series is awesome and definitely in my top 5 shows of all time.   And yeah, I haven't even seen the original series.. should I?"

BSG,3b58or,kengou,2,Fri Jun 26 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"Feel free to skip Galactica 1980, just watch the final episode with Starbuck.  That one's excellent.  Then head on to the re-imagined series and start with the miniseries.  I'm glad to see another fan of the classic '70s show, though, I don't see that too often around here.  It's corny and obviously a Star Wars knockoff, but it's still awesome damnit!"
BSG,3b58or,Meterus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"I confess I really didn't care for the 1980's BSG. In fact, that left a bad enough impression on me that I didn't watch the reimaged one until I was out of work for a year, at one point. I had enough time, and I started watching it... Holy Frak, I loved it, the second time around."
BSG,3b58or,19mine,2,Fri Jun 26 20:56:26 2015 UTC,"If you really like the original series, check out Buck Rogers in the 25th century. The same guy created it(Glen Larson) and it has a very similar feel. I guess you could say they are also in the same universe. There is a little bit of tie-in in the second season. No direct crossover though."

I was afraid going into this that I was committing to something that nobody would care about. I'm really, really glad that so many people participated in every thread.  Thanks to /u/lostmesa for stepping up and posting a dozen or two of the rewatch threads.  Thanks to /u/onemm and /u/MarcReyes in particular for driving the conversation forward with some really insightful comments  And thanks again to everyone who took part, this was really awesome for me."
BSG,3asygo,lostmesa,8,Tue Jun 23 06:59:18 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone who participated! This was really fun to take part in. It's great we still had an active rewatch after a year and a half.
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,6,Tue Jun 23 13:43:07 2015 UTC,Thanks to all you dudes! It's really kept the sub and show alive for me. I was honestly surprised at the amount of comments and all y'all gave me a lot of new perspectives on different parts of the show!
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,5,Tue Jun 23 07:31:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks to you, /u/trevdak2, for even having the idea to do these discussion threads! And special kudos for sticking to the once a week format. I know many people like binge watching these days, but watching one a week for the last year and a half has been the closest experience to watching it the show when it was on originally on, and I haven't had that experience in a long time. Seriously, I haven't had this much fun watching the series since their original airings!"
BSG,3asygo,onemm,2,Tue Jun 23 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"Really, really appreciate the shoutout, but it was completely unnecessary. I enjoyed every minute of this rewatch, and not only was it your idea but your commitment to posting the thread/numbers almost every week despite your hectic schedule. Let's be honest."
BSG,3asygo,saffagaymer,13,Wed Jul 1 04:15:20 2015 UTC,"I think im one of the few that liked the ending considering the religious overtones since the miniseries..... I get people frustration with the ending, but it always made sense to me. Im agnostic btw"
BSG,3asygo,nah_you_good,9,Tue Jun 23 09:07:30 2015 UTC,I feel like you can enjoy religious themes without being religious. Especially if it's only implied then people won't get too annoyed. I think it would've been pretty boring if they eventually found Earth but it was through hard work and exhaustive searching.
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,5,Tue Jun 23 14:32:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a Christian, and I enjoyed the ending, but I don't really feel like my enjoyment had much to do with my religious views. Besides the appearance of there only being one god and his dislike of worshipping other gods I didn't see a lot of moral similarities. He seemed mostly concerned with rebooting human civilization and having them interbreed with the Cylons. His angels also seemed to fall along orange and blue morality and seemed to encourage any means to achieving god's end goal including lying to Baltar or sitting by as Baltar implicitly encourages Boomer to commit suicide in Season 1. Another weird thing is Head Six telling Baltar that people who die on Kobol don't go to afterlife. Though you could argue that what the angels say or do isn't necessarily a reflection of BSG god's will. Though I do think that they deliberately drew on story elements from the Bible like the Cylons being Noah's flood, Starbuck's resurrection/ascension etc. I just find the BSG mythology to be more interesting as its own thing than trying to somehow see it as an extension of my own religion or other religions.   I'd be interested to see if anyone can point out other specific places in the show where they outline some of the BSG god's morality."
BSG,3asygo,kerelberel,4,Tue Jun 23 17:09:17 2015 UTC,There are a couple of philosophy books which deal with the show's themes.
BSG,3asygo,onemm,2,Tue Jun 23 17:38:48 2015 UTC,Im agnostic btw   I'm an atheist and I absolutely loved the ending.
BSG,3asygo,Seanathin23,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:16:55 2015 UTC,"I love the ending, the religious overtones were always there and Head Six even says she is an Angel of God."
BSG,3asygo,lazerbullet,7,Wed Jul 22 02:34:56 2015 UTC,POP QUIZ:  Name a recurring female character that didn't die a single time.
BSG,3asygo,kerelberel,10,Tue Jun 23 07:04:16 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of every single female character in more than one episode, who does not die:    So, yeah. better to be a redshirt in Star Trek than a female on Galactica."
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,2,Tue Jun 23 07:24:26 2015 UTC,Fascinating. And I barely remember any of them
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,4,Tue Jun 23 09:46:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's awesome they got their own names and were recurring, no matter how minor."
BSG,3asygo,LtNOWIS,2,Tue Jun 23 17:39:50 2015 UTC,It really helped to connect with background characters. Mathias was a character on the show who appeared in only a few sporadic episodes and has very minimal dialogue and yet she was one of my favorite background characters. Would have liked to see her during the raid of the Colony. Alas.
BSG,3asygo,Leadmeter,4,Wed Jun 24 18:51:16 2015 UTC,Seelix.  At least as far as we know.
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,5,Tue Jun 23 07:52:36 2015 UTC,Up for debate: Starbuck.  Was she truly alive at all?
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,2,Tue Jun 23 14:05:09 2015 UTC,"Head Six kind of counts. She's female, and she outlived all of the main characters by thousands of years."
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,2,Thu Jun 25 06:40:59 2015 UTC,Do the women from Baltar's cult count? They only show up halfway through season three though.
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,3,Tue Jun 23 07:15:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I replied to my own comment with a list of every female character who doesn't die, with three of the women in the cult included."
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,8,Tue Jun 23 07:26:05 2015 UTC,"So the disappearance of Starbuck and her ambiguous existential nature is a fairly divisive part of the show. Personally I loved it.  One aspect of it that I felt was especially good is that Lee and Kara ended on a good note with each other but they didn't end up together. I just couldn't see it working out for them in that way and this ending seemed true to their relationship in the past. It would have felt forced to me.  Another aspect about Starbucks ending was that she finally felt like she had a purpose, accomplished it and was finally satisfied. Her whole life she felt restless and spiritually adrift so I guess I just felt relieved and happy for her.  I like comparing this quote from season 2 Starbuck:   After they attacked, I never pined over any of my old crap. Never missed it. Stupid view of the parking lot. Broken toilet in the bathroom...You know, everyone I know is fighting to get back what they had. I'm fighting because I don't know how to do anything else.   to this quote form the finale:   Lee: Where are you going?  Kara: I don't know...I just know that I am done here. I've completed my journey, and it feels good.   I also love the idea of Lee spending a good part of the rest of his life exploring."
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,6,Tue Jun 23 07:50:04 2015 UTC,"One aspect of it that I felt was especially good is that Lee and Kara ended on a good note with each other but they didn't end up together. I just couldn't see it working out for them in that way and this ending seemed true to their relationship in the past. It would have felt forced to me.   Ron Moore had a great point in the commentary. The last scene we see of them back on Caprica is when they are just about to have sex and right before they go through with it, something prevents them. In this case, Zach waking up. It's this moment, Moore says, that truly sums up Kara and Lee's relationship. A moment where it seemed like something should happen between them, but nothing ever would happen between them and they spend the rest of their time together trapped in that moment.   So the disappearance of Starbuck and her ambiguous existential nature is a fairly divisive part of the show. Personally I loved it.   Same here. I know a lot of people would want a definitive answer, but honestly would that have made her exit any more fulfilling? This show was always character first, story second. Kara got what felt like to me an emotionally fulfilling ending.  Moore's thoughts on Starbuck simply disappearing:        I'm very settled on that. I felt that was the right way to go. You just could not give definition to it and the more you tried, the less satisfying it became."
BSG,3asygo,onemm,5,Tue Jun 23 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"While I like how they kept it ambiguous, I'll admit I definitely have a preferred interpretation of Starbuck. I like to think she was always human (not a otherworldly being, or once a human but replaced by an angel). I just think it makes her story more interesting since it would mean she's still vulnerable and doesn't secretly understand everything.   Do you have a preferred interpretation, or do you like multiple interpretations? I know there are some people that think she's an incarnation/manifestation of the goddess Aurora."
BSG,3asygo,lazerbullet,5,Tue Jun 23 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"You know, I actually like that it's left so ambiguous. If I had to point to a specific thing as to what I think she actually is, then I'd say that she was an ""angel"", albeit a different type than the Six, Baltar, and even the Leoben that we saw last season. Most of my reasoning why has to do with what Leoben says in season one, of which we see a flashback before the jump to Earth.  Something to point out is Head Baltar's last lines in the show where he tells Head Six that ""God"" doesn't like being referred to as that name. In the commentary, Ron Moore say he threw that in as one last little twist for viewers to ponder if they wished. Because of this I've now developed a theory that God is in fact some larger entity with some control over events in the universe, but isn't simply a deity, but rather some higher power that we interpret as god, gods, or any derivation thereof. If you know DC Comics mythology, I'd say it's something akin to the Monitors who watch over the DC Multiverse.  Ultimately, I think over the years I've stopped caring so much about what she was in the end, simply because I thought the emotional conclusion to her story was so powerful and I've felt this way even back when the episode first aired. I guess character trumps mythology for me, but yeah, the closest thing I've settled on was that she was some type of ""angel"" who clearly wasn't aware of what she was. Her job was to lead humanity to a new home and once she did, her job was complete and she could go.  I just realized that what I'm saying is, she's Gandalf!"
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,4,Tue Jun 23 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"I guess character trumps mythology for me, but yeah, the closest thing I've settled on was that she was some type of ""angel"" who clearly wasn't aware of what she was.   Totally agree about character over mythology and how they nailed it emotionally with her. And I suppose being something other than human doesn't make her secretly all-knowing so it doesn't really affect her character. Right before she leaves, she does seem to know what's going on, whether that be a divine revelation or finally remembering what she was. I guess the only interpretation of Starbuck I really don't like is the idea that she was replaced by a being pretending to be her.  What are these Monitors from DC like? I don't care about spoilers, but it does sound interesting. The BSG god almost seems like a gardener clearing out a garden and starting in a new place, breeding two plants together to make something new and maybe better."
BSG,3asygo,kerelberel,4,Wed Jun 24 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"The Monitors are a race of beings that operate on the highest plane of existence in the DC multiverse, even above the gods themselves. Each Monitor is tasked with the preservation and study of a separate universe. They aren't supposed to get involved but a few have, leading to the various Crisis events DC has had over the years. In this way, I liken the BSG god to them in that it is a bring that exist on a higher plane than man and machine and guides the universe as it sees fit.  I like your analogy of the BSG god. As we know, all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again. The plants change, but the garden essentially remains the same. Old BSG was cleared away for New BSG, which itself may very well be replaced by Movie BSG. ""The players change, but the story tensions the same. """

BSG,3asygo,ebneter,5,Wed Jul 1 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"I really like that they never really explained Starbuck. I think it's heavily implied that she was brought back by 'God' (or whatever it likes to be called) to bring humanity to Earth, but do we need it spelt out for us? I think not."
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,3,Tue Jun 23 09:48:01 2015 UTC,"That's my take as well, though I don't think we can really know for sure. I like to think she was human the whole time but was brought back from the dead and then recalled when her mission was complete.  Though I think she played a role similar to the angels versions of Six, Baltar, Leoben, Elosha, etc I always viewed them as nonhuman entities, either supernatural or natural but beyond our understanding."
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,5,Tue Jun 23 16:32:38 2015 UTC,Why did the Leoben angel want her to die only for God to resurrect her?
BSG,3asygo,OnBehalfOfTheState,4,Tue Jun 23 17:41:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure but I've thought about it a lot. Here's some of the reasons I could come up with   to help her believe that she does have a purpose and give her conviction to carry it out so that when she comes back people see it as supernatural and follow her lead in looking for Earth and/or to prove that the BSG god is real to the people to give her the ability to sense Earth to help her develop as a person, Leoben seemed to be really concerned with her previous fear of death and helping her to come to terms with her death to be more dramatic, it's hard to say what they had already written when they had killed her off, but I'm pretty sure I heard on one of the commentaries that she knew she was coming back. Plus, they also played really hard on that Special destiny angle before she died so I don't think they were doing that just for her to die and never come back."
BSG,3asygo,Seanathin23,3,Tue Jun 23 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"Bonus points: That line   ""...everyone I know is fighting to get back what they had. I'm fighting because I don't know how to do anything else.""   was ad libbed by Katee Sackhoff."
BSG,3asygo,lostmesa,10,Wed Jun 24 06:40:26 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be fun to list the final words spoken by each of the characters. So here we go:  Cylons: One (Cavil): FRAK! [Shoots himself] Two (Leoben): The Sixes, the Eights, and the Twos have decided to stay. See how we can contribute to a world before we pass into God's hands. Three (D'Anna): You know, all this is just gonna happen again and again and again, so I'm getting off this merry-go-round. I'm gonna die here with the bones of my ancestors and it beats the hell out of being out there with Cavil. Gonna die in the cold and dark when Cavil catches up with us. (Sighs) Don't you ever want to stop fighting it, Colonel? Hmm? Don't you just want to stop all of this? Four (Simon): They've broken off the download! Five (Doral): It's a trick! Open Fire!  Final Five: Samuel Anders: I'll see you on the other side. Galen Tyrol: I'm just tired of people. Humans. Cylons. Whatever. Last raptor out tomorrow is gonna drop me off on this island that I found off one of the northern continents. It's cold. It's up in the highlands. There's no people. The Gazelle Ellen Tigh: Saul! All I've ever wanted was to be with you. Not just weekend liberties or a two weeks leave a year. I mean full-time. You and me, together, in a house, in a tent, homeless on the street. Just be together. Colonel Saul Tigh: To us! [Drinks a shot] YYYYYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHH!!!  Crew and citizens of the Battlestar Galactica: Callandra ""Cally"" Henderson Tyrol: (Shortly before being airlocked) It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. It's okay. Anastasia ""Dee"" Dualla: (Looking at an old photo of herself) Sometimes I don't even remember that's me. It's so long ago. She has no frakking idea what's ahead of her. Dr. Sherman Cottle: Going to cheat a little bit and post his final conversation with Laura.       Laura: Thank you, doctor. Cottle: I'm just doing my job. Laura: No, You've done much more than that. You've taken a patient who should've died years ago, and you've given her a chance despite her cancer and the cylons and her own obstinate nature. And you've given me the little time I have left, and for that, you have my... My heartfelt gratitude and my thanks. Cottle: Well, I- I don't know what to say... Laura: No, no, don't. Don't spoil your image. Just light a cigarette and go and grumble. Cottle: (Laughs)(Kisses Laura's hand) She's your patient now, Ishay.       Tom Zarek: Gaeta, what the frak is wring with you?! Wake up! Felix Gaeta: It's stopped. Sharon Valerii, Callsign: ""Boomer"": I'll pay you back one day, sir, when it really means something. Sharon Agathon, Callsign: ""Athena"": Hera! Karl C. Agathon, Callsign: ""Helo"": Okay, maybe Mommy will teach you [to build a house and plant crops], but Daddy's gonna teach you to hunt. Kara Thrace, Callsign: ""Starbuck"": Again, gonna cheat and put the last words of real Kara, who we see in the flashback, and ""angel"" Kara, who's last scene is with lee. Doing this because we technically are getting two versions of Kara in this episode. ""Angel"" Kara: And now that you're here? Real Kara: It was nice to meet you, Lee Adama. Lee Adama, Callsign: ""Apollo"": Goodbye, Kara. You won't be forgotten. Head Six: Mathematics, law of averages. Let a complex system repeat itself long enough eventually something surprising might occur. That, too, is in God's plan. Head Baltar: You know it doesn't like that name. (Head Six gives him a look) Silly me. Silly, silly me. Gaius ""Frakking"" Baltar: You know, I know about farming. Caprica Six: Hey. I know. (Kisses him) I know you do. President of the Twelve Colonies, Laura Roslin: So much life. Admiral William Adama, Callsign: ""Husker"": I laid out the cabin today. It's gonna have an easterly view. You should see the light that we get here. When the sun comes from behind those mountains, it's almost heavenly. It reminds me of you."
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,6,Tue Jun 23 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"Something I caught this rewatch was Ellen's reaction to Tyrol's last words. ""There's no people."" Ellen stops him and just gives him a hug. It was actually quite sad. Tyrol really did lose a lot. So much so that at the end, he just wants to be alone and that breaks Ellen's heart. Kind of broke mine too.  I love Laura's last words, but I think my favorite is Baltar's. The way he breaks down (One of James Callis' best scenes, if not the best) when he says he knows about farming is heart wrenching. He has come full circle. A boy who grew up on a farm, abandoned his family and heritage, and now finds himself embracing what he once rejected. Such a cathartic moment and its the emotional complexity of the scene and the man is what, to me, makes Baltar one of the greatest television characters of all time."
BSG,3asygo,BaltarForPresident,6,Tue Jun 23 21:32:50 2015 UTC,Baltar's last words and Roslin's last words are kind of a tie for me as well. Both were so perfect and fitting for their characters.
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,2,Wed Jun 24 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"Gods Baltar's line just kills me. I get emotional when I think about it still.   It's up there with Tigh's ""Not all of them,"" from Exodus part 2."
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,6,Wed Jul 22 02:46:22 2015 UTC,It took me three full watches of the show and this post to realize D'Anna stayed on the first Earth!  Great idea for a post by the way. What's the final thing Tigh says in the current timeline?
BSG,3asygo,onemm,4,Wed Jun 24 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"It's to Tyrol, before he leaves: Good luck. For what it's worth, if what happened to Cally had happened to Ellen, then I'd have done the same frakking thing.  To be honest, I really like his big yell in the flashback.

BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,5,Wed Jun 24 01:44:38 2015 UTC,"I really wish Tigh would have said goodbye to Bill. But, I'm sure he'd visit. I guess we got a taste of a goodbye when they toasted to the end of Galactica a couple episodes ago."
BSG,3asygo,CowboyFlipflop,4,Wed Jun 24 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think one last big scene with them would have been nice. I think their last scene together in present timeline is Tigh informing Adama about the Galactica having broke her back.  As you said, I think their scene together last episode, toasting to Galactica, served as a nice final scene together.  Actually, they do have this one powerful, yet subtle moment in the finale. It's right before Adama gives the order to jump to the Colony. They share this look to one another. It's not quite a smile, not quite a nod. These two old friends just look at each other as if to say, ""Here we go, one last time. You and me."" I urge you to go seek it out. It's quite powerful and says more than words ever could."
BSG,3asygo,sowr,4,Wed Jun 24 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting story behind Cavil's last moments. Originally, Tigh was going to grab Cavil and throw him from the second level to his death. Dean Stockwell called up Ron Moore, something he had never done before, and told him he wanted Cavil to just shoot himself in the head, stating that Cavil would figure that is all pointless anyway and he would just blow his brains out. Ron agreed and that was that."

BSG,3asygo,onemm,4,Wed Jul 1 05:46:45 2015 UTC,"Whenever I listen to criticism of scifi I always divide it into two kinds: Obsessed, over-involved fan whining, or real problems.  I feel like the complaining about this ep is mostly crap not worth taking seriously. Unlike the rest of this season it didn't even feel crammed in, it felt like they saved enough time for the end and it all played out at the right speed.  The negativity over the religious stuff is unsurprising but not important. As has been hashed and re-hashed, it was always a show that tackled religious disagreement. That's really nothing new - the show is a war story, and it's a religious war. If anyone else had been in charge of the show we would've all done something different instead, but we're not, and no one cares.  I will say that two things needed more explanation: Like the (briefly) President said, ""I must admit I'm surprised at how amenable everyone is to starting over."" That was a quick dream in Apollo's head and then a quick talk with his dad and it happened.  Secondly Starbuck just disappeared. Why? I won't join in saying it didn't make any sense because clearly she was a strange case and a strange crewwoman from the start. That's fine but why?"
BSG,3asygo,MarcReyes,5,Tue Jun 23 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"These are my two major complaints as well. I think they stick out so much because the majority of the show was very good about telling a fluid story, but these two things just seem a little bit disjointed.  First, I think there needed to be some more extreme circumstances that would cause people to give up all technology. I mean, they are literally going back to the stone age here, which, would be even more difficult living than roaming the galaxy in a fleet in fear of Cylons. Now they have to be worried about predators, minor injuries, and primitive diseases. I honestly believe that this would be far more devastating to the ~40,000 survivors than had they kept at least a little bit of their technology.  On the second point, I also have a problem with Starbuck simply disappearing. I understand that she was brought back to serve a specific purpose, but at the same time why does that necessarily mean that she leaves when that is accomplished. I guess I would have liked to see her get a break (other than death/nonexistence) after being tormented by her destiny throughout the show.  That being said, I LOVED the finale overall. The assault on the colony was so well done and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I liked that the opera house turned out to be the CIC, and that the shared visions were finally resolved. The religious themes were integral to the show, so I am not bothered by them.  Overall, this has become one of my favorite SciFi series. I guess I am becoming a bit of a RDM fanboy as I think this and DS9 are my favorite series I've seen."

BSG,3asygo,lazerbullet,3,Wed Jun 24 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure I completely bought that Hoshi would become admiral. I think the Moore wanted to give it, along with the presidency, to a familiar character. In the commentary he says that it was because Hoshi is the most senior and trusted officer who chose not to go but, I don't know, it still wasn't entirely believable to me. I suppose it doesn't really matter in the end. Love the shot of the Red Stripe Centurions first coming aboard the Galactica. The scene proved Baltar right from a few episodes ago. Centurions were welcomed aboard the Galactica, at which point it did in fact become a blended ship. Mentioned this in the comments of my ""Last Words"" post but I really loved that last look shared between Adama and Tigh just before they jump to The Colony. Says so much with so little. ""Once more into the fray..."" ""Skulls"" got his skull crushed. ""Please continue stating the perfectly obvious. It feels me with confidence."" Glad to see Cavil not loose his biting sarcasm in the face of annihilation. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't used that line on people. Upon your first time watching this episode, did anyone else think Helo died in that hallway, and then pleasantly surprised to see him alive at the end? I think the most fan-pleasing moment definitely had to be the shot of the old and new centurions beating the shit out of each other. I loved seeing the Red Stripe blowing the mechanical brains out of the old style centurion! Really great VFX on the whole. Cinema quality in some shots, I thought. Moore made a great point in the commentary that I can't believe I never picked up on before. Baltar was the man who started the series by giving the Cylons access to the defense mainframe which lead to the destruction of the colonies, and it's Baltar who is the man who talks the Cylons out of taking Hera and into ending the war once and for all. The man who began the conflict with the Cylons is also the man who ended it. Brilliant."

I always thought the reason why Hoshi was given the command was because of his loyalty. He chose to follow Cain despite her flaws and he chose to stay loyal to the fleet despite his love for Gaeta during the rebellion. I'm probably missing some things, and my logic can probably be easily picked apart, but this was always my interpretation.   Glad to see Cavil not loose his biting sarcasm in the face of annihilation.   Honestly, I've grown to love Dean Stockwell, in large part because of you, and I just wanted to thank you for revealing his awesomeness to me.   did anyone else think Helo died in that hallway, and then pleasantly surprised to see him alive at the end?

BSG,3asygo,kerelberel,3,Wed Jul 1 05:45:30 2015 UTC,"Notes from the commentary:   The extended episode were to feature scenes of nudity in the strip club and Ron Moore and David Eick tease the director, Michael Rymer, for not shooting any. Rymer said there simply wasn't time to do so given how hectic the shoot was for the finale episode. Pretty funny hearing them tease him about it. The symbol in Baltar's lair is referred to as the GULL, which stands for Grace, Unity, Life, Love Ron Moore on the Galactica's last act: I didn't want her to tear apart. I didn't want her to explode. I just wanted her to be broken. She had done what Adama said she would do, which is to get them all home. Originally, when Laura asks Kara where she had taken them after jumping away from the Colony, Kara responds, ""Somewhere along the watchtower."" This was omitted by Rymer who felt it was a little too much. Ron agreed so the moment is left to play as it does in the episode. I glad they changed this because I think it would've been pushing the song a little too hard. I know some people already had issues with using such an identifiable song and if she had said that, it might've pushed them over the edge. I know it would have with me, and I liked the use of ""All Along the Watchtower."" Helo and Athena were originally planned to die as a showcase for how far they were willing to go to save their daughter. It was changed because it felt unnecessary. Although you can't see it (by design), the t-shirt Ron Moore is wearing in his cameo at the end is a Jimi Hendrix t-shirt. For the scene with Adama puking in the in the ally, Edward James Olmos actually showed up drunk! The scenes of Baltar and Caprica retreating in the hallways and finding Hera were the official last shots for the series."
BSG,3aplj6,Damien__,17,Mon Jun 22 13:52:05 2015 UTC,"The reboot is amazingly reverential to the original series. In addition to the ""original war"" Cylons being the Cylon designs from the original show (complete with ""by your command""), the fleet ships are also the same, and the theme music of the original show is reworked as the Colonial anthem (first heard in ""Final Cut,"" the first episode with D'Anna Biers)."

This is why Sam says they didn't invent resurrection, they reinvented it. The war on Kobol was between the mortal humans and immortal skinjobs, it ended with them going their separate ways. Once on Earth the skinjobs figured out how to reproduce naturally and resurrection tech was lost over the centuries until the Final Five rediscovered it in their skinjob DNA.

I don't even remember most of it.    What I remember from BSG is the characters and their reactions to the end of the world.  I remember the music, the drums, the atmospheric guitar riffs.  The Olympic Carrier's hand's shaking as he read reports of the attack.  Duala's last date with Lee and her bittersweet smile in the locker mirror.  Roslin and Adama - ""I'M COMING FOR ALL OF YOU!""   etc.  I really don't care about who created whom, kobol, earth, new earth, and all that jazz.

I just didn't see how they were gonna find 'our' earth and make that anything but cheesy or supremely disappointing. Imagine if a shuttle from Galactica landed and contacted the USA or really any gov't. They would be studied and their tech would be dissected and reverse engineered. What would NOT happen? They would not be listened to. They would be ignored. If their message actually made it to congress  your climate change denying majority would become a cylon denying majority. Cities would be in ruins before congress actually admitted that other-world humans had landed and the whole country would be destroyed before they ever admitted there was a danger.

BSG,3a0adz,trevdak2,7,Tue Jun 16 05:40:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know why but the thing that stuck with me most of the entire show is the scene with Hotdog and Adama where they mention all of the photos left behind and the fact that they were probably put up by someone who is now dead and nobody knows who they were anymore. We are all just a generation or two away from being completely forgotten.   I've been thinking about since the show ended and in the meantime my mother has died, I am probably the only person who thinks about her on a regular basis and after I am gone it will be like she never existed at all. This troubles me. Even celebrities and popular figures will eventually fade away. Will people in the year 10,000 give a rat's butt what Brad Pitt, Winston Churchill, Star Wars, or BSG were?  It does sort of resonant with the series,   I don't really know where I am going with this, it's just something that stuck with me."
BSG,3a0adz,phaser_on_overload,6,Wed Jun 17 23:20:43 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's rough, I'm sorry for your loss.  We're alive in the age of information, though. Unlike in the past when people disappeared with all evidence of their existence, our generation will be preserved for a long, long time in digital photos, videos, and text"
BSG,3a0adz,crazyeasy,3,Wed Jun 17 23:54:56 2015 UTC,Yes. I just imagine future grave markers with a barcode or what have you that uploads and displays videos and pictures of the person you scanned. A digital service brought to you by Facebook...
BSG,3a0adz,steven_wood,5,Sat Jun 20 20:21:01 2015 UTC,Whether we know the name of our great-great-etc. grandparents or not we do have that chain connecting us to our great-great-etc. grandkids.
BSG,3a0adz,sowr,6,Thu Jun 18 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"I just finished BSG for the first time yesterday. I really want to talk about ""Daybreak"", but I watched it all in one, so I would have a hard time separating part 1 from the rest. So, I will probably be back next week, and I hope there will be others to discuss it with me!"
BSG,3a0adz,kerelberel,3,Wed Jun 17 03:47:01 2015 UTC,Surely there will be.
BSG,3a0adz,MarcReyes,5,Wed Jun 17 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"The more I listen to the podcast commentary, the more I think that Ellen Tigh is based directly off of RDM's wife."
BSG,3a0adz,MarcReyes,6,Wed Jun 17 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure if I like how Caprica Six pulls some strings for Baltar's dad. While it's kind of cool that they show  another side of her as someone with more emotional insight than Baltar, I love the simplicity of her being a purely seductive force and Baltar, while being extremely intelligent, being extremely vulnerable to his sex drive.  By having her find a living arrangement for his dad, it shows that his affention for her was more than skin deep and kind of weakens the character that he's had for the whole series."
BSG,3a0adz,lazerbullet,5,Wed Jun 17 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"During that same time she was also strictly against humanity, killing babies in the crib and such. I kind of agree this good side of her should've emerged further down the line, after many of the events, not that she had it right from the start. It also fits the theme of change characters experience: Cylons change and become better after the are exposed more to humanity and human emotions."
BSG,3a0adz,MarcReyes,3,Wed Jun 17 05:53:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know. You certainly bring up some salient points, but I personally didn't feel like it was too out of character. I took it as another way of getting into Baltar's mind so that he would give her access to the defense mainframe. Plus, we know from Downloaded that she harbored genuine feelings for Baltar."
BSG,3a0adz,lazerbullet,5,Wed Jun 17 19:06:53 2015 UTC,Sherman Cottle  Love that they gave him a first name in the last episode.
BSG,3a0adz,lostmesa,6,Wed Jun 17 05:14:02 2015 UTC,"I will save most of my thoughts for next week, so /u/sowr rest assured there will be others next week, but I just wanted to touch on a few things.   ""I've actually forgotten your name."" I liked this line from Baltar because I forgot that that version of Six wasn't officially given a name until season two's Downloaded. I love the way Mary plays the scene when she finds out about the death of her remaining family. You can tell that Laura intuitively knew there was some very bad news. According to RDM, this was in the original show bible as part of Laura's backstory. I also liked the water from the fountain falling on Laura which then cuts to the medicine dropping into present Laura's IV. Always weird seeing the Galactica empty, but particularly weird seeing it being the Admirals quarters which, to me, has been an iconic set in the Galactica. Even weirder that it's all going to a basestar. Bodie Olmos finally gets a scene with his dad! That was pretty nice to see. Sam only ever being interested in ""perfection"" never really sat well with me. It never seemed like an aspect of his character that was explored in the show, so it out of place here. Almost as if it was tacked on to connect Sam closer with his cylon-self. One major thing from the commentary; After she downloads, Ellen was originally going to team up with Cavil after she learns that Tigh had been sleeping with Caprica Six and together they would have been the big baddies of the final few episodes, including the whole plan to kidnap Hera. This was changed because Moore felt that it didn't feel right that what takes us to the end of the series is a personal dispute between Ellen and Tigh. That would have been a really weird ending. I'm glad they changed their minds. This episode was shot at the same time the pilot for Caprica was shot and Moore devotes a little time on the duality of one show ending and the other beginning. Pretty neat.   Overall, a nice start to the finale, but all three parts should definitely be watched together. Even RDM recommends it in the commentary. I look forward to next week!"
BSG,3a0adz,MarcReyes,3,Wed Jun 17 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I kind of dig Ellen as a villain. When she was a human, she always seemed a bit of a destructive force, and the fact that she was the mastermind behind the final five, and set a lot of other events in motion, doesn't sit well with her being a goodie for me."
BSG,3a0adz,Seanathin23,3,Wed Jun 17 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"My only big issue with it is that it takes the show, which was always an ensemble piece about a group of characters, and focuses the ending conflict on two, both of whom where supporting characters. To me, all the other characters would get too much of the short shrift."
BSG,39x5w5,FoamBornNarwhal,4,Mon Jun 15 15:03:30 2015 UTC,Your new Cylon toasts bread very well. Mine never comes out so evenly done. I gotta get a new Cylon.

BSG,39v0sm,gowronatemybaby7,3,Mon Jun 15 00:53:37 2015 UTC,"People on our server are building a 1:1 Mercury class battlestar in survival. Two years and counting... We also have a lot of ships from the colonial fleet.  Here's a real time dynamic map.  Also, I've made a few Mk II Vipers too (not 1:1, bit more detailed). Map here."
BSG,39v0sm,Vergis_CZ,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:54:26 2015 UTC,"Wow! I can't even imagine doing that in survival. Oof!! This was mostly an exercise in comparative scale for me, so I tried to make everything as close to 1:1 as possible, while still maintaining the original design as much as possible. I also made Serenity from Firefly. The rebel fleet which the folks over at /r/starwars don't seem to like very much. And I started with a 1:1 of the original Enterprise."
