It's ""not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption"" according to the new dietary recommendations.  I'd count sugar instead since there actually is a recommendation for that.  Also, I disagree with the coloring.  A food that is 7% saturated fat per 100 calories should not be red when the recommendation is <10% of calories.  It's actually very confusing because nothing on the list tops out over 10%.  It's a misleading formula at the very least."

nutrition,3e2mpt,simple_mech,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"Yea just simplify your diet.   For protein shoot for meats, fish, canned fish (if you have the choice then go with salmon because of the exponentially lower mercury content), Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, I heard Tesco in the UK now has quark so look for that, egg whites. Supplement with protein shakes if necessary.   For fats you have avocados, butters, oils, nuts, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, chia, hemp to name a few top picks), nut/seed butters, eggs.   Everything else is carbs. Stick to complex carbs from potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, legumes (think lentils), some breads (multigrain, whole wheat, etc), some cereals, oatmeal, brown rice, fruits and vegetables. The list goes on. Without getting to into the details post workout would be the ideal time to consume high GI carbs such as white rice and pasta but it's better to just avoid them because essentially simplicity trumps all.   Just find what works for you. It's difficult to tell someone this or that because x might be less expensive than y here but vice versa where you are. Simplifying your diet will do wonders for you.

nutrition,3e2mpt,DasMess,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! I'll break this down by meals. This is only for the days I work.  Breakfast: Apples and Bars, and part of lunch  So I usually get a dozen or so apples, whichever one is .99c a pound, and a box of slightly old or damaged but still perfectly good Kind bars ($12/box). 2 apples and 2 bars is my usual breakfast. This goes farther then you'd think.  Breakfast cost: $3ish  Lunch: Hot meal and bag of baby carrots (every other day) ($1)  I like to make stew for lunch. I have a large dutch oven at home Wallmart Cheap Brand Not this one but very similar, from Walmart under 40 bucks.  I don't have a stew recipe, but I go off of what I learned cooking this Jambalaya (Which I have made for $20 dollars with churizio and OMG is it good)  Basic ingredients of a hearty lunch stew are:   2 cans of beans ($1/each) Large onion (50c?) 4-6 red potatoes ($2-3?) 2 peppers ($2?) 2 pounds of frozen goat chunks ($6-7) 1 bottle of non-HFCS BBQ sauce ($3) Pepper, Salt, Garlic, Turmeric to taste   Cook for 2 hours at 350F, stirring at 30 and 60m, and cracking the lid at 1:30 to burn off some liquid. If you want more specific details i'll try and hammer out a recipe. I've been going off instinct mostly The filling factor from this comes from the combo of potatoes, beans and goat. Goat is low in drastically lower in fat, marginally higher in protein, and more sustainable then beef! Also it's fucking delicious. Goat is delicious  And then dinner is Fish, White Rice and a Veggie (mostly because my GF is Peskatarian)  Fish: Basa/Catfish/Flounder/Tilapia ($5-7 pound) Kale/Broccoli: $1-2/pound White Rice: $20 for 20 pound bag (Every 3-4 months)  And for snacks during the day, at night, I get myself a package of individually boxed raisins ($1-2), some dried papaya ($3), and dried cashews ($6) and bring some amount of this to work with me  Now, if you're looking for a MACRO based meal plan, I can't help you. But I'm a very active rock climber, and I find success with this type of diet. It keeps me going thru some hard training, and I don't typically feel hungry during the day."

nutrition,3e2mpt,Life-in-Death,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:46 2015 UTC,Ethnic stores (usually Asian/Hispanic/Islander) are the best.
nutrition,3e2mpt,Tall_LA_Bull,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're comparing eating healthy to in terms of price. Eating healthy at home is much cheaper than eating out even at cheap places. Sure, if you go to Whole Foods and buy lots of produce, it's expensive. But it sure doesn't have to be. I live in LA and spend like half my wages on rent, I can't afford much on food, and I eat great. A few tips:  1) Shop at the cheaper grocery stores. Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are great, if you're rich. But they're also a scam. The food at the lower-end American/Western grocery stores is some of the cleanest, safest, most abundant, most varied, most nutritionally complete food that's ever been available anywhere at any time on earth. People who insist that it's unhealthy to eat from anywhere but a ""health food"" grocery store are wrong. I buy at Ralphs when I don't buy at the ethnic markets, and I'm in perfect health and have six-pack abs.  2) Shop farmer's markets for produce, but MAKE SURE YOU COMPARE PRICES with the grocery store. Again, the baseline is that getting regular old produce at a regular old grocery store is fine. If you can find a comparable or better price at a farmer's market, that's fantastic! Better for you and MUCH better for your local economy and ecology. But only get deals there. Don't pay for the image.  3) Shop regularly (at least 2x a week and switch up your days) and compare prices over time. The prices at your grocery store are not static--they change weekly or even daily as the store gets stock and its stock ages. Chicken breast is often $4-5/lb, but once every month or two, they'll mark a bunch of it at $2/lb. As soon as that happens, I fill my entire freezer with chicken breast. Do this with all meats. Prices will change, things will go on sale. Check often, be ready, and have a big freezer.  4) Don't do big bulk trips. Unless you find a spectacular deal on something, don't buy more food than you need for a few days. Keep yourself going back to the store, and keep yourself with more limited options for delicious food to eat. If you really want a particular thing, go to the store and buy it. It'll be easier that way to control your diet and to not let food spoil.  5) When considering brands, especially of things that you'll eat regularly, consider calories per dollar. This is especially helpful if you're counting calories. One meal I eat a lot is a pound of chopped chicken breast and a (5 serving) can of ""Grillin Beans"" all mixed together with Sriracha. There are multiple varieties of these beans. One variety has 120 cal/serving, another has 180 cal/serving. That's 50% more for the same price! So I make sure to always buy the higher caloric load ones, and make my money count. Between my cheap chicken and my high-impact beans, I get a meal with almost 1500 calories, over 25g of fiber and well over 100g of protein for less than $5. THAT is cheap, healthy eating. (Note: Obviously, that's a lot of calories. I'm a huge, active, weight-lifting dude, so I need a ton of calories. If you want less, split this in half and eat it over two days.)  6) Eat simpler food that requires less ingredients for a recipe. The biggest secret to dieting (IMO) is that you can retrain your taste buds to like things they don't currently like, just by eating it regularly for a few weeks. I trained myself to enjoy plain, steamed broccoli, and now I spend less money on dressings. I weaned myself off of recipes that require expensive spices I'll only use once. I am not fazed by making a big batch of something and eating it every day for a week. Stuff like this will really help reduce your overall bill, and it's only a sacrifice if you mentally frame it like one.  List of foods that you should be eating besides lots of veggies: Chicken Breast, Canned Tuna, Greek Yogurt, Cottage Cheese, Rice and Beans."

nutrition,3e2mpt,mcdowellag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"Since you are in the UK here are some notes from my own experience - I do a weekly shop in Sainsbury and get a few things in Tesco:  1) Sardines in olive oil are about 50p except that every now and again Sainsbury try and push boneless sardines at about twice the price. Since they are very low on the food chain, they are eco-friendly and low on nasties like mercury as well.  2) Both Sainsbury and Tesco do basics red kidney beans in water at 35p or less - fibre plus protein. Usually you have to hunt for them hidden on the floor-level shelf.  3) Similarly, both do a basics pasta shapes at about half the price per kg of other similar pasta. Not only is it usually on the shelf by the floor, but it is in small 500g packets so it looks like it should be expensive - check the price per kg or do the arithmetic.  4) Basics frozen chicken breast is surprisingly cheap. Sainsburys seem to play this strange game where there is a 500g pack and a 750g pack and whichever one is cheapest is different week by week - again look at price per kg. Perhaps you should factor in the price of something like soy sauce to give it some taste.  5) I decided to switch from eating lots of fruit and some veg to lots of veg and some fruit and my weekly bill went down a lot. One 60p iceberg lettuce, one Â£1 cos lettuce, and one 80p pack of (untrimmed) celery is a lot of veg for a week. I buy carrots loose because if I ate all of a value pack in a week I'd probably turn orange.  6) Porridge oats is easy to do in a microwave, a cheap breakfast cereal, and good for you."

nutrition,3e4vc3,supersweettooth,2,Tue Jul 21 23:44:59 2015 UTC,"You are addicted, and this is definitely a disordered eating pattern. I've been through the same thing. You can change it. Compulsive eating feels so hopeless and out of control, but you really can stop.  You need to remove the junk food from your life. Completely clear it out of your home. You will still encounter it somewhere, so the really important part is your state of mind: decide ""I don't eat junk food."" Straight up, end of sentence. There's no bargaining and no fudging it.   If you slip up and eat something bad, recognize your mistake but just put it behind you. Remind yourself you don't eat that stuff.  Allow yourself to eat as much healthy food as you want. Have an intense craving for ice cream, candy, coco puffs, whatever? Eat vegetables. Feel free to eat huge amounts of them too. Healthy foods are not gonna satisfy your cravings and it will drive you crazy for a while, but that's because you're in withdrawal.   It goes away eventually. Ice cream still sounds tasty, sure, but once the crazy cravings subside, and you realize how good real food can be, you won't want to eat crap.  That's my experience. I had to do cold turkey and change my whole relationship with food. (I actually do a paleo diet and intend to stay that way. That's not necessary, though.

nutrition,3e4vc3,cupcakeraynebowjones,2,Wed Jul 22 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"One of the things that makes this hardest is that I live in a really popular area near downtown in my city, so just on my street alone (literally less than a 3 minute walk) I have two pastry/sweets shops, an ice cream shop, and a convenience store filled with junk food. So that's where things like the cupcakes come from, I don't even buy them in advance, it's just so easy! But, maybe buying healthy things like the veggies in advance will make it easier to make that change when I get a craving.   I'm going to start telling myself I don't eat junk food right now, and I guess try quitting cold turkey if that's what's best. I'm just so sick of feeling this way (physically and emotionally).

nutrition,3e4vc3,catching-stars,2,Wed Jul 22 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"Just based on what you listed for what you ate, I am thinking that maybe it would be worthwhile to focus on actually adding foods.   For instance, vegetables. Because it doesn't seem like you are getting your (at least) 3 servings of veggies per day. Also, there doesn't seem to be a lot of protein in your diet (again, based on what you listed). Protein, fiber, and healthy fats keep you full without the blood glucose roller coaster. The whole thing about the headaches and being tired may point to blood sugar extremes. So, maybe try an omelette for breakfast (with lots of veggies) and sub some of the pasta at lunch for a healthy protein--that could be whatever, tofu, chicken, beef, nuts, plain yogurt.  With the snack it seems like you have your fruits servings down, so  maybe try having some tangerines and a protein. Instead of 6 of them, maybe 2 of them plus string cheese or almonds or a hard boiled egg.  I'm suggesting that you focus on adding because it seems like subtracting/deprivation is not working for you. So, by adding foods  (and focusing on the addition/abundance of food rather than the shortage of a diet), you are pushing the sugars out of your diet while also beginning to eat more healthfully.   If you are looking for a program, I've seen good reviews for this one (https://iquitsugar.com/8-week-program/). You can search sugar addition and a bunch of results come up for programs and stuff. I am not a dietitian, so take this with a grain of salt, but I would think that a cleanse might not be the best way to make a lasting change to your diet.   I sincerely wish you the best of luck!"

The quality of your diet is what causes inflammation.  In other words, what else you eat with the rice with determines how your body will respond to the rice.

nutrition,3e18zg,throwitawwwwway,9,Tue Jul 21 04:30:01 2015 UTC,"Try flavored gum or mints, some can be sweet enough to satisfy a craving. Also since you already are chewing something that isn't sugar, that's a plus too. Also, if you spit out your gum/mint and ate the sweet food, it would taste different, a kind of negative reinforcement. Also like stated above, cravings will dwindle with time. Will power is everything. Think if that few seconds of sugar happiness is worth it to derail your nutrition goals or to cancel out a great meal"
nutrition,3e18zg,thejetter,2,Tue Jul 21 05:36:08 2015 UTC,"Have to agree hear- something fresh and minty really did the trick for me. Brushing teeth after a meal also really helps. If you really want to avoid eating anything at all then I would suggest also going for a brisk walk, even if for only 5 minutes, after eating. It will wake you up and chances are your cravings will lessen."
nutrition,3e18zg,curbhq,12,Tue Jul 21 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"You're addicted to sugar. If you can use will power to go without it, or at least dramatically reduce it for a while, it will become easier and easier. People who avoid sugar generally don't have strong sugar cravings just like people who don't smoke don't really have cigarette cravings.  It may not be a popular opinion in our era, but I'd recommend trying to substitute it with artificial sweetener for a while and see if that works. Maybe some sugar free candy or diet soda. Good luck!  P.S. Not a nutritionist, just a guy who used to eat way, way more sugar and now doesn't miss it."
nutrition,3e18zg,wishIknewwho,7,Tue Jul 21 05:19:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard that artificial sweeteners cause you to crave sugar even more.  Here's a source:    One study of 3,682 individuals examined the long-term relationship between consuming artificially sweetened drinks and weight. The participants were followed for 7-8 years and their weights were monitored. After adjusting for common factors that contribute to weight gain such as dieting, exercising change, or diabetes status, the study showed that those who drank artificially sweetened drinks had a 47% higher increase in BMI than those who did not.  One concern about artificial sweeteners is that they affect the bodyâs ability to gauge how many calories are being consumed. Some studies show that sugar and artificial sweeteners affect the brain in different ways.  The human brain responds to sweetness with signals to eat more. By providing a sweet taste without any calories, however, artificial sweeteners cause us to crave more sweet foods and drinks, which can add up to excess calories."
nutrition,3e18zg,wadduplilmama,5,Tue Jul 21 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"In my (probably unpopular, and certainly unqualified) opinion there are only two ways to stop cravings;    Feed the cravings Don't feed the cravings   Feeding the cravings will make them stop because you've scratched the itch. This solves your immediate problem, of stopping the craving, but doesn't solve the underlying issues.  If you stop feeding the cravings they won't go away instantly (obviously) but they will eventually stop - or maybe you just learn to ignore them.  The third option is to manage the cravings (which is different to stopping them) by substituting with other foods (fruits/artificial sweetners/natural sugars) instead of your regular, more unhealthy desserts. This is what most people do but, personally, I found I would always end up going back to the sweeter, more unhealthy options in the end."

Just start with diet and drop off of caffeine if you can. I stopped with diet Sierra Mist and just started drinking a ton of water.    If you push yourself hard enough, you'll get away from the cakes, muffins, paistries, cupcakes and ice cream. Once you stop taking in sugar for a few days, you crave it less. After a few weeks you'll find yourself not even wanting anything sugary. It'll almost seem excessive and you won't crave it.    Focus on ""Fake"" sweets first like diet drinks and Crystal Light mixes. You'll get off of sugar if you keep it up.    Hope this all helps."

So my advice would be not to give it up completely but to cut down on obviously sugary things like candy, chocolate, cake etc.   My cravings reduced but never really went away. I ended up feeling miserable having dinner with friends when the deserts came out.  Life really is no fun if all you're doing is avoiding stuff you like. So take a stand and cut out some stuff but allow yourself some treats in the plan too.  I substituted bad sugary stuff for fruit when I wanted something sweet but didn't want something bad.  Good luck!"

nutrition,3e18zg,bartmanx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:34 2015 UTC,"There is quite a bit of advice, so you are unfortunately going to have to weed through the chatter.  In my case, part of the problem was the meal I was eating beforehand. If I had a lot of refined, starchy carbs, then my sugar cravings were worse right after that meal. What happens is the liver is kicking into high gear to produce a lot of insulin to start working with all those carbs. Once it gets ramped up, it becomes a vicious cycle, wanting more and more. Conversely, if my meal had lots of vegetables, or less refined carbs, then my metabolism wouldn't ramp up to high speed, and the sugar cravings were reduced.  The best way to slow down my metabolism after a meal has sometimes been to take a tablespoon or two of olive or coconut oil. Something about that was telling my body to slow down, and even that coating feeling in my stomach helped to calm me down."

More specifically however, what's your general diet like? The type of meals you have could also influence cravings. Satisfying meals that are either heavier in fiber or healthy fats would somewhat blunt the craving because of the better blood sugar management."

We are allowed to have some treats from now and then. I personally found that when I crave something and I try to beat that craving with healthy alternative, it rarely works. Just go for it and don't beat yourself up for it. You just need to make sure you are eating 15% treats and 85% healthy foods."

I've always loved steak, but found that it was slowing me down at times...then I found out that if the steak is grain-fed, the toxins bind themselves to the fat of the animal and we then consume them! So making sure the meat is grass-fed (and finished) is one really important factor - especially in today's world!  The other thing is often overlooked, and that's how well we chew our food! If we smash a steak dinner in 5 or 6 minutes then we're going to put a heap of stress on the digestive system...  I hope those two points help! Overall, I find that steak is fine for 'clean-eating', but may be worth bringing it in a couple of weeks into a new regime. Hope that helps and best of luck!"

However, if you're below what it determines that it needs, it will build the muscle.  I was 30 pounds below what I should have been/am now, so it was trivial to put that weight back.  Unless you're sending your body a signal that it has to put on a lot of muscle and rest such that it can do it, you won't put on muscle.   6-8 hours 4/5 days a week   More like 2 hours one day per week and do it as hard as you can.  Doing it as hard as you can?  No harder, literally until your body screams at you to stop and ignore it as if your life depends on it.  Then rest.  If you do 6-8 hours/day 4-5 days/week, you might get 2 pounds.  I recommend watching this Body by Science"

What you eat may somewhat change the chemistry, especially fatty acids, but you're not going to be getting your Vitamin C that way, no sir. You pee that right out.  Fat-soluble vitamins, despite the name, aren't actually stored in your belly fat, but your organs. The amount of fat-soluble vitamins stored in your organs would theoretically be below toxic levels and not proportional to the amount of excess body fat on an obese person. You would run out of water-soluble vitamins very quickly, fat-soluble vitamins less quickly.  No matter how you become obese, you will not be able to rely on your body to store vitamins for you.

So, knowing that you initially reduced overall caloric intake by reducing carbs--your insulin sensitivity will be much higher than before. By raising your overall caloric intake by just raising carbs, that means you'll become hungrier as your raise your carb intake. My suggestion would be to raise your protein and carb intake at an equal pace, with raising your protein intake as priority 1. Although consumption of protein and increased consumption will still create an insulin response, it will be much less than that of what an increased CHO intake would be.    Edit: Since you're working out now as well, increased protein consumption may even help with recovery/muscle growth--given that you're doing more anaerobic activity rather than just aerobic."

Glucose and fructose are the simplest and a size of 1, termed a monosaccharide. Sucrose (table sugar) is made up of two molecules, falls into the disaccharide category. The bigger the saccharide structure, the more complex the carb is. Because these ""complex carbs"" have bigger and more complex structures they take longer to break down, meaning the body can't convert them into energy as quickly. Fiber (soluble and insoluble) are just saccharides with large and odd enough shapes that our body can't break them down 100% or at all. They slow digestion and kinda ""catch"" debris in our digestive system and carry it out."
nutrition,3drxt8,knockout2281,6,Sat Jul 18 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"It's probably worth adding that the term ""complex carbs"" isn't a very useful descriptor outside of scientific purposes, and doesn't have a whole lot of practical relevance, per se. Maltodextrin is a polysaccharide, so it would be considered more ""complex"" than sucrose, a disaccharide. Yet it's absorbed just as fast and has a higher glycemic index. Starch, again, is a more ""complex"" carbohydrate, but highly processed starchy foods (e.g. white bread) aren't that much different in terms of effect.  These quickly-absorbed carbs aren't necessarily a bad thing - during and immediately after workouts it's quite beneficial to consume some ""quick energy"" in these forms because it improves performance and recovery (which is why sugars/maltodextrin are put into sports drinks). But the rest of the time your carbs should be from things that are more slowly digested and/or absorbed - mostly this means eating foods with a decent amount of fiber (fruits, vegetables). And of course there's a big range of starchy foods (mainly grain products) that lie somewhere in between - exactly where depends, but as a general rule it's best to eat them in moderation, and combine them with something else filling (fiber from vegetables, protein).   Sugars are carbohydrates and all carbohydrates are turned into glucose(sugar) sooner or later, so whats the deal here? Isnt sugar and carbs the same thing then?   Two of the main reasons to avoid sugar are:   Overall nutrition - foods high in sugar tend to be lacking in micronutrients (because they're usually processed junk). Satiety - foods high in sugar tend not to be filling, and negatively influence your subsequent eating (and overall) behavior in a non-workout context. This is tied in with blood sugar/insulin levels among other things.   It's worth noting that fruits tend to be high in sugar (in the form of the monosaccharides fructose and glucose), but they also tend to be high in fiber and micronutrients so the above points don't apply most of the time, or at least not to the same degree.  Some people will go much further and claim sugar is downright toxic in its effects (proponents of Dr. Lustig for example), but claims like that need to be taken with a grain of salt and it's all kinda relative."
nutrition,3drxt8,NoInkling,2,Sun Jul 19 03:55:35 2015 UTC,Good point. I was trying to give a really simplified explanation. It's also worth pointing out that when we're talking about rate of digestion and absorption in the context with glycemic index we also need to consider glycemic load and other macronutrients consumed. A meal generally isn't just two pieces of starchy white bread. You slather that with fatty peanut butter or have some proteins rich deli meat and cheese and thinking about the absorption rate of the bread carbs is kinda mute.

nutrition,3drxt8,mcdowellag,4,Sun Jul 19 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Isnt sugar and carbs the same thing then?   Don't mix up the biological definition of sugar with the layman's definition.  Potatoes are not sweet.  They have starch, which is two glucose molecules (glucose+glucose; a disaccaride).  Glucose is a biological sugar (monosaccaride).  Sugar (e.g. table sugar, Coke, ice cream) is also called sucrose and is glucose+fructose.  Sucrose is broken down into glucose and fructose.  Sucrose rots your teeth way more than anything else because the bacteria that overwhelmingly cause cavities like sucrose.  Ironically enough, blood sugar is a glucose-based index, not a fructose based sugar index.  Fructose doesn't raise even raise blood sugar.   And what is fiber then?   Fiber is a carbohydrate that is somewhat fermented by bacteria in your large intestines into fat, which you can then absorb.  Most of it is just inert and has no effect."
nutrition,3drxt8,wiz0floyd,2,Sun Jul 19 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"Carbohydrates are either simple sugars or break down into simple sugars. Starch - and I suspect maltodextrin - breaks down into just glucose (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch) while table sugar/sucrose breaks down into both glucose and fructose. Glucose is pretty much common currency for the body, but fructose needs processing in the liver. Some of the theories about sugar being bad for you are based on this extra processing in the liver.

I need to emphasize this.  Therefore, the goal should be to minimize your losses.  Typical, as you approach the competition, you would decrease your amount of training (in terms of volume) but keep a high intensity (i.e. shorter, intense workouts).  This will maintain your fitness without burning yourself out.  Also, it will minimize muscle degredation if you are on a cut (which you are).    In terms of diet, I have heard BCAA's can help, especially if  you fast.  Maybe take them just before bed.  Otherwise, try to get simple carbs and protein right after your workouts.

nutrition,3drpjr,lightworld,4,Sat Jul 18 21:19:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, man!  You can get all of your essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids just from eating a varied diet rich in vegetables, fruits, grains (preferably sprouted, and preferably varieties that have been shown to digest easily, such as quinoa or millet), and some animal product supplementation.  Leafy greens will provide the highest concentration of vitamins and minerals, along with the proper balance of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fats.   Use this website to enter the name of any food to see the nutritional profile: http://nutritiondata.self.com/.  Diversity is key. You want to consume a wide variety of whole foods, lots of leafy greens, and in portions that allow for good absorption. Check out information on food combining, eating according to circadian patterns, and the effects of the mind on the digestive process (parasympathetic vs. sympathetic activation).  Water soluble vitamins leave the body each day, while fat soluble vitamins are stored for later use. Eating fruits and vegetables each day is important in order to keep your water soluble vitamins in check.  I'm not a nutritionist, but I have studied in China with Taoist monks, I've studied in the Himalayas with venerable yogis, I've lived in Korea for several years and studied with monks there, and I've witnessed diets in many other places. I am convinced that eating alongside the seasons, taking in a huge variety of whole foods, especially leafy greens of many types, is the best option for vibrant health. Be selective of the healthiest foods, but never picky about the new foods.  Three nutrients stick out to me as most potentially problematic, which are Vitamin D, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Vitamin B12. Vitamin D can only be manufactured by the body after exposure to sunlight, or consumed from animal products. However, just because you eat some eggs or a steak does not mean you will get the Vitamin D that you need. Also, not any sunlight will allow you to make Vitamin D. This vitamin is crucial to so many physiological processes! Read more about it here at Harvard School of Public Health: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/#vitamin-d-deficiency-a-global-concern.  B12 is tricky as well, because the problem researchers have uncovered with it is that it is not absorbed by all people! Even whilst it is present in most animal products and in some instances on the skins of fruits and vegetables, there is no way to know if you are absorbing the vitamin without getting a blood test. B12 is also extremely important, so get your levels checked. Fortunately, B12 takes years to be used up by the body. It is recycled with almost perfect efficiency.  Omega-3 Fatty Acids can be supplemented, and you should read as much as you can about the various options. I recommend whole foods, always, and prefer to take fermented cod liver oil over common fish oil supplements. You want high levels of DHA and EPA, and it's not easy to find a reliable supplement to get these. Fermented cod liver oil also provides a rich source of undamaged (unheated) Vitamin D and Vitamin A.  Foods I think are great: refrigerated bee pollen, sprouts (amazingly rich in essential nutrients), leafy greens (more variety the better), fermented cod liver oil, plenty of cooked and raw vegetables and fruits, coconut products (check out the other kinds of fats and their benefits), and plenty of fermented foods (read the research on gut bacteria and its relationship to overall health, mood, and digestion).  Just as much as what to eat, what not to eat should be considered. Processed foods are inflammatory. They take up diet real estate. Caloric real estate. They are hard to digest. Read research on the effects of the foods you eat to find out what you should try to eliminate.  Thanks!"

nutrition,3dq517,billsil,5,Sat Jul 18 14:40:43 2015 UTC,"Eating purines doesn't give you gout.  Eating purines if you have kidney problems worsens gout.  It's a very long terms solution.  I've had a gout flare.  It's not fun.  Gout is also very, very strongly associated with refined sugar intake, so maybe the kidneys are damaged by sugar and the purines lead to symptoms, but if you didn't eat so much sugar, you wouldn't have problems.  Just a thought.  In my case, I'm just a medical nightmare (5 chronic diseases), so who knows what I did.  My body has a tendency to overreact.  I can go for a 2 hour bike ride, feel great, and 2 days later my back will lock up, affect my gut, I'll bleed off 20 pounds in 3 weeks, and I'll be underweight for 6 months until my back calms down, and I'll put the weight back on in the span of a month or two.  It's during one of these bouts (it was a year long that time) that I had a gout flare."
nutrition,3dq517,FrigoCoder,3,Sat Jul 18 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"Same reason other chronic metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes are controversial: It has become very fashionable to blame meat and fat for chronic diseases, and to whitewash carbohydrates even when it is blindingly obvious they are at fault. Research sponsored by the food industry and pharmaceutical companies aren't helping. Lo and behold, recommended low fat diets do not help diabetes either!  Hyperuricemia in particular is most commonly caused by insulin resistance of the kidneys making them retain uric acid. Excess carbohydrates are the number one reason you get insulin resistance, meat or not. I bet your friend also stopped eating so much carbs when he started getting his calories from meat.  There is also a genetic component to gout. In this case, fructose elevates adenosine levels by accelerating the breakdown of ATP, as well as increasing levels of lactic acid, which interferes with excretion of uric acid. Alcohol also elevates adenosine levels by the same mechanism.  Cut sugars, keep carbohydrates at a reasonable amount (<120g), avoid alcohol, avoid most grains, and there won't be gout flare-ups. Exercise could also help I guess by improving insulin sensitivity, but it also produces more lactic acid.  Ketogenic diets in particular can reverse diabetic nephropathy and insulin resistance in the kidneys, but actually make gout worse for a few weeks, because ketones compete with uric acid for excretion, until the body learns not to waste them."
nutrition,3dq517,LususV,2,Sat Jul 18 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"My experience follows this pretty well; my flareups were when I first started keto, and I also wasn't hydrating nearly enough. Once fully in keto, I haven't even felt a hint of pain in my toes."
nutrition,3dq517,LususV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:44 2015 UTC,How does this contribute to discussion?
nutrition,3dq517,fluxtime,2,Sun Jul 19 09:25:59 2015 UTC,"I stay on a hypocaloric diet, pretty much 100% of the time.  I have to take allopurinol to avoid gout.  Getting a uric acid monitor was the best thing ever since I could titrate the allopurinol to keep my UA below 5.       The only thing I have observed that causes UA to jump is eating at very low calories.  Content of my diet seems to have no obvious affect.  Insufficient hydration will make it worse, but thats temporary.  There was a paper on fructose and gout a little while ago, but I can't find it right now."
nutrition,3dq517,LususV,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"I had two gout flareups earlier in the year; both started the day after drinking too much beer (one came after a weekend in which I ate a LOT of oysters and other shellfish).   I've since had weekends where I've eaten a lot of shellfish, and I eat a lot meat otherwise (low carb diet) and have had no gout attacks (but I've also limited the beer to next-to-none).  I do keep a bottle of concentrated cherry juice in the fridge in case I have a flareup; I found a tablespoon of that daily made the attack go away better than any medication."

Let cool for awhile and the pluck the cloves out of the paper, collecting them on the side.  Then mash those up, throw them in a pan over medium to medium high heat, and stir every few minutes until the whole thing has gotten a dark brown color.This step always takes longer than you think and takes a lot of stirring. If the pan gets sticky, toss in a bit of water or beer or lemon juice or white wine to deglaze the pan but keep going. Something acidic.   In the end you will have a delicious garlicy dark brown mush. I like chopping up rosemary or tarragon and dumping it in during the final few minutes."

Too much garlic is baaaaad for your gut (you're gonna shit yourself), and if you eat a shit ton (like 3 bulbs+) in one sitting of crushed garlic (cooking denatures some of the enzymes), you might end up with really low blood pressure and potential arrhythmia (your heart doesn't beat like it should).

Why not eat what you desire but with the right portion size? Another thing works is to figure out what you are craving and come up with healthier alternatives?   If you crave pizza, why not make a healthier version pizza with tortilla as crust and add more veggies as your toppings.   If you crave burger, why not make your own burger patties and use lower calorie burger bun or simply use portobello mushroom as buns?   Eating the same thing day in and day out will make you so tired of the food and it will cause you to go back to unhealthy foods. Try to go for variety and always explore new veggies or fruits in the grocery stores. Focus on eating mostly whole natural foods and don't restrict. If you want a piece of candy, let yourself have it so you don't feel unsatisfied with your diet.   A healthy fit life is all about moderation not deprivation. Hopefully this helps."

I don't see any veggies in what you normally eat, so just try to get a handful of veggies at each meal.  For carb sources: your whole wheat options are great, basically all fruits are fine, try a mix of berries like blueberries and strawberries with the raspberries you already have, just so you have a balance of different nutrients and good plant chemicals. Others carb sources like potatoes/oats/beans/legumes are all great choices.  Protein sources are fine with eggs and chicken, you can of course do lean beef, fish, or turkey also.  if you eat 3500 calories per day, at a general ""endurance athlete"" balance of 60% carb, 20% protein, 20% fat...This comes out to 525g carb, 185g pro, 75g fat per day.  Thats a lot of carbs, given that 1 cup of cooked rice/pasta is around 40g carbs, and 1 banana is around 30g carbs...you're going to need a lot of food, which isn't bad, your body just requires a lot of fuel.

I'd add some vegetables to your diet and maybe some fruit, especially before exercising.    Doing a very calorie restrictive diet is usually unsustainable for most people and can result in binge eating after you reach a certain weight loss goal, undoing all your hard work.  Personally I'd look at loosing less weight per week so that it's more sustainable in the medium/long term and up your workouts more to include both cardio and resistance training; people the same height and weight can look very different depending on how much muscle tone and fat they're carrying."

However, it will be pulling from muscle more harshly since you're no longer providing the body the amino acids it requires from the protein intake and will need to breakdown muscle to acquire them.  So probably more overall loss and probably more fat loss because of the higher deficit, but I wouldn't recommend it as it will eat away your muscle as well."

Everyone's blood sugar spikes a little after eating carbs and this is perfectly normal as long as it doesn't  go too high and your body is able to ""clear"" the spike effectively.  Have you been diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance or done a test for same?    I would suggest seeking a dietitian for advice.  The most common substitutions for starches are vegetables, which is totally fine but don't forget that appropriate weight gain is also important so might have to increase intake elsewhere. Typically when people have gestational diabetes the aim is for consistent carb intake with portion control, and to choose high fibre/pair with protein to help slow absorption of sugar into the blood.

Your body didn't evolve the mechanism of thirst to regulate water/sodium balance for no reason. Drinking extra water will just lower your body temperature and result in a higher body fat% as the metabolism adjusts downwards in response to excess water.  If you drink more water make sure to supplement extra salt and other minerals because you will lose so much more in your extra urine. But, I think it is a really foolish thing to do."

You don't even hold extra water weight I believe because you're cycling it through so often. I'm pretty sure if anything it makes your metabolism better. I also don't drink cold water, just room temperature from the jug.  I also used to have high blood pressure so my sodium intake of 2000mg or less with that much water keeps it optimal.

nutrition,3dinq3,EggsNButter,-3,Sat Jul 18 06:08:09 2015 UTC,"A healthy human has a body temperature above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day. If your temperature is lower than this that would indicate hypothyroidism(slow metabolism). In hypothyroidism, water is retained to easily, and too much water can cause seizure and other problems:  ""The typical hypothyroid person loses salt rapidly in the urine (and probably in the sweat, too, though that is usually diagnosed as cystic fibrosis), and retains water, diluting the urine less than normal. The reduced production of carbon dioxide, with increased susceptibility to producing lactate and ammonium, causes the cells to be more alkaline than normal, increasing their affinity for water. The rise of estrogen that usually accompanies hypothyroidism also increases intracellular pH, loss of sodium, and over-hydration of the blood.  The hypo-osmolar blood of hypothyroidism, increasing the excitability of vascular endothelium and smooth muscle, is probably a mechanism contributing to the high blood pressure of hypothyroidism. The swelling produced in vascular endothelium by hypo-osmotic plasma causes these cells to take up fats, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. The generalized leakiness affects all cells (see ""Leakiness"" newsletter), and can contribute to reduced blood volume, and problems such as orthostatic hypotension. The swollen endothelium is stickier, and this is suspected to support the metastasis of cancer cells. Inflammation-related proteins, including CRP, are increased by the hypothyroid hyperhydration. The heart muscle itself can swell, leading to congestive heart failure.  When people force themselves to drink a certain amount of water every day, even when they don't feel thirsty, they are activating complex adaptive processes unnecessarily. Thirst is the best guide to the amount of fluid needed.  When extra water consumption is combined with a low salt diet--as physicians have so often recommended--a healthy person can adapt easily, but for a hypothyroid person it can have disastrous effects."" (http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/water.shtml)  Basically drinking excess water will cause the body to spend more energy trying to maintain body temperature. If caloric intake is not increased in response to the excess water then the body will adapt by further lowering the metabolism so that less energy is spent on hormone production, energy, and other functions so that the body can have more energy just to maintain the temperature.  So, keeping caloric intake the same while increasing water intake should lead to greater body weight via excess water weight retention, and greater body fat% as a result of a slower overall metabolism in response to the excess water.  I think a better plan would be to only drink water if you are thirsty, and to choose fruit juice instead of water as the sugars in fruit juice can stimulate metabolism and allow the water from the juice to not slow metabolism further."

nutrition,3dinq3,EggsNButter,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"If you do find your body temperature is lower than average I would look into trying to increase the temperature with a diet supportive of metabolism. The metabolic rate basically influences all of the bodies processes because it controls the rate at which blood and nutrients flow throughout your whole body, as well as the rate at which tissues are repaired. A faster metabolism means that the body just functions with more energy at every level.  The Ray Peat diet focuses on the types of foods that increase metabolism, while minimizing those foods that inhibit the thyroid gland, thereby decreasing metabolism. So I recommend looking into that type of diet if your temperature is low: http://www.raypeatforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=20  With, the one caveat, that a lot of foods optimal for the metabolism are foods that are difficult to digest when body temperature is still low(milk, larger amounts of fruit juice, ect) so I wouldn't restrict denser foods like white flour or other starches until the body temperature is high enough to handle more types of watery foods."

Your muscles will atrophy if you don't use them, and they go away fast. The way your body sees it is that since you aren't using the muscles, it is not worth the energy to keep them. In short - consuming a ton of protein when you aren't exercising muscles just becomes excess calories that your body will store as fat. Muscles aren't an energy store so unless your body thinks you need them (by using them) it is going to store fat instead of muscle.   Bottom line is you need to exercise in some way to make eating excess protein worth more than just excess calories. 30 minutes of walking per day will help build leg muscles (especially if you include up and downhill, stairs, walking on varying terrain, etc.) and simple weight lifting for your arms."
nutrition,3dj7rg,Zheoy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your in depth reply. I do understand these concepts though and I absolutely understand why a lot of my muscles HAVE atrophied; downward spiral of chemo and transplant and graft vs host. I've done what I could, when I could, without causing further problems (there was probably 2.5 years where the most mind numbingly easy ""workout"" would make the gvh in my muscles flare up and contract and cramp like crazy for 2 weeks =().   BUT I've always tried to do what I could. With my lungs failing my ability has fallen on top of the loss of muscle, but I feel it would be a misrepresentation to say that there isn't muscle to be built. Despite my limitations on exercise there is quite a lot of damage/tearing/repair that is needed on a daily basis.  For the time being the GvH has moved away from my muscles but for years it's been a constant ""flexion"" and tensing of my muscles and that's why I aim for high protein/amino acids (take amino acid pills) because I can always tell if I dip for a little bit; I can feel my muscles not keeping up with the demand. On top of that there is the sheer physicality of breathing that strains all my primary+secondary breathing muscles more than at any time in my crossfit/bodybuilding type training in the past.   So while my body hasn't been in state of putting on any excess muscle unfortunately, it's been a battle to keep what I have. I'm trying to take advantage of the muscular gvh respite and am working out more (Thank GOD!) so I'm still left wondering what my body is doing with these fat stores.   It's probably nothing but genetics or something. Lord knows there's been a lot of chances for mutations to occur over the years. But I feel I owe it to myself to try and maximize body efficiency wherever I can just in case.   Thanks again!"

There's not a golden rule that says ""you can fast for X days without health consequences"", but there are essential nutrients that can't be synthesized from your fat reserves. A PSMF diet (around 600kcal to 900kcal) provides the minimum amount of calories and vitamin supplementation to lose weight in a 'safer' way (while still being very stressful and potentially dangerous for your body depending on your health).  Keep in mind, if your BMI falls within a normal range (assuming you have average muscle mass), high calorie deficits will make you lose more lean mass than body fat. If you want to look better you'll have to exercise and eat at a small deficit. Check keto calculator to check approximately how low you can go without losing muscle."

It took some time for them to have the category I wanted in stock, but in your case that may be a blessing in disguise, allowing you to save more in the meantime.

nutrition,3dduqm,fastifguy,14,Wed Jul 15 14:28:54 2015 UTC,"My personal experience has been that the number of calories consumed is the best metric to affect body composition (muscle vs body fat) and weight loss. At the most basic level, the time of day or the frequency of eating does not affect body composition / weight loss if you are eating the same number of calories. Emphasis on the ""if"".   The catch is that the time of day you eat and the frequency of meals eaten usually affects the number of calories you eat! Generally, people will say ""don't eat late at night, your body turns the calories into fat."" While that's not entirely true that calories eaten later in the day turn straight into fat, the advice to avoid eating late at night is usually good because people tend to eat unhealthy snacks at night. If you eat healthy things at night and are still within your calorie goal, you're fine!   Similarly, the ""eat many meals"" advice only works if you stay within your calorie goal. Whether you eat 5 meals or 2 meals doesn't truly matter in terms of weight loss. But if you eat just 2 meals, you might get very hungry at night and suddenly cross your calorie goal.  To change your body comp / weight, one good strategy is to record calories. Then try different things: eat many meals, eat few meals, eat early, eat late, eat protein, eat veggies. Basically try it all and see what strategies help you reach your calorie goal!   TL;DR: For changing body composition / weight, no one way works for everyone. But there are ways to find out what works for you."

nutrition,3dduqm,decimated_napkin,2,Wed Jul 15 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"If you're wanting to restrict this down, look more into ~1200 calories in a 5 hour window, 19 hours fasting. This follows closely with what I've done on the Fast5 intermittent fasting diet and I've honestly never loved a diet more. I feel great long term, my appetite is very normalised and healthy, etc. I usually pick 5pm-10pm window or thereabouts.  Sometimes this may mean I have 1000 calories at 5-6pm and 200 later on at around 9.

And yeah, the whole point of keto is that you metabolize fats into ketones for energy.  Triglycerides take a dip because they are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, which are used to make glucose and ketones respectively.  LDL is a double edged sword. It helps in tissue repair, and the delivery of cholesterol, which is very important, but it is also atherogenic under inflammatory conditions and when oxidized. Keto has anti-inflammatory mechanisms that make arterial inflammation less likely. Ketones have anti-oxidant activity, you essentially get a new set of endogenous antioxidants on top of your existing ones. Ketones also burn slightly more cleanly than glucose, they produce less waste products. Beta-hydroxybutyrate can also lower LDL levels in a similar manner to niacin.  HDL goes up on keto, because of the higher rate of fat scavenging and utilization. Similar mechanism as exercise as far as I know."

Unfortunately, this necessarily entails burning proportionately more fatty acids for fuel (or whatâs called being âfat adaptedâ in horribly egregious articles filled with wishful thinking like this one) and turning down thyroid functioning, or the rate at which we live, adaptations that are directly at odds with reaching our full potential as human beings.""

When fat is used for fuel (lipid peroxidation) it is inflammatory, catabolic and anti-metabolic.

We can use fat for short term fuel, this is an adaptive, survival mechanism in the body, however itâs not supposed to happen continually.  This puts the body in a catabolic (degenerative) state. A healthier approach to reducing body size that will also promote longevity, fertility and a youthful appearance: lose fat, not weight by repairing the metabolism. (On being a âfat-burnerâ) Being biased toward using fats to make energy represents the metabolism of the aged, the overweight, and the diabetic. In the effort to speed up weight-loss, people are destroying their ability to make energy from glucose because fatty acids block glucose oxidation (efficient metabolic function). Monitor the temperature and pulse of a âfat burnerâ and it will indicate they are hypometabolic and highly stressed. âThe oxidation of fats rather than glucose means that the proteins wonât have as much protective carbon dioxide combined with their reactive nitrogen atoms.â â Ray Peat PhD Itâs been proven thereâs an antagonism between unsaturated fats and glucose assimilation, meaning that any time weâre stressed (or deprived of glucose), and forced to use fat for energy, we have free fatty acids released into the blood; we are basically breaking our own tissue down.

nutrition,3deqd5,billsil,3,Wed Jul 15 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"5'6, 150 lbs. currently have my calories on myfitnesspal to 1500, I am trying to lean up while not starving myself and remaining healthy. is that to many?   You are eating way under your caloric needs. Using this calculator, with a conservative ""moderate"" activity level, you should be consuming ~2500 calories per day.   My current macro nutrients are set to 40/40/20, Is this a good balance for my intended purpose?   This spread is probably fine. So long as you are meeting your 1.0+ grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, you should be able to maintain muscle mass and reduce body fat. But, if you're really eating only 1500 calories each day, it's possible you're not meeting that protein requirement. At 1500 calories, 20% of which is protein, you're taking in 300 calories of protein, at 4 calories/gram, which means you're getting 75 grams of protein each day, which is just over the 1.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (150 lbs. * 2.2 lbs./kg = ~68 kg). Furthermore, the amount of protein required for an athlete to maintain lean muscle mass is disputed amongst nutritionists. You may find better results at 1.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight, or even higher. You are barely meeting the 1.0 g of protein per kg of body weight, but as long as you are satisfied with your results, I wouldn't change anything.   I am having trouble eating enough protein, is this a simple problem that could be fixed by eating double the servings?    It's not quite that simple, as you'll have to consider the change in your caloric intake due to adding extra material. This is further dependent on your goals in terms of weight maintenance/gain/loss.   Am I not doing enough cardio/training to see faster results? (I am so close to visible abs but can't get the extra push) or is this a diet problem that can be fixed in the kitchen?   You're probably doing plenty of training, much more than most individuals who are not professional athletes. I can't say for sure why you're not seeing the results you had anticipated. My recommendation would be to switch to a ""bulking phase,"" at least for the next few weeks or months. After you've put on some weight, try to go for a ""cutting phase"" again, attempting to get back to your pre-bulking weight (150 lbs. in your case). After this entire bulk/cut cycle, you will probably achieve your goal of six-pack.   On the Myfitnesspal app, it subtracts calories from how many steps I walk. Should I disable this or is it a accurate measure of calories being burned?    I'm not familiar with the application, but I'd probably disable it since you're already eating way below your caloric needs and it is only encouraging you to eat less."

nutrition,3deqd5,Fitzcity,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:30:15 2015 UTC,"I am having trouble eating enough protein, is this a simple problem that could be fixed by eating double the servings?   What 20% or 40%?  When someone says 40/40/20, they usually mean 40% carbs, 40% fat, 20% protein (which I suspect you're not doing).  20% protein is pretty standard and on 1500 calories should be easy to eat given your weight.   Am I not doing enough cardio/training to see faster results? (I am so close to visible abs but can't get the extra push) or is this a diet problem that can be fixed in the kitchen?   You don't need to do a lick of cardio or crunches/situps to get abs.  Sitting/standing up straight is the best way to do it and since sitting up straight is super important for all sorts of things (e.g. mood, carpel tunnel, back problems, success with the opposite sex, neck tension), you might as well do it.   Should I disable this or is it a accurate measure of calories being burned?   It's super inaccurate (all calorie burn calculators  are terrible.  They are functions of weight and how intensely you are doing something (which is more than a little challenging to estimate properly), when they should be a function of your oxygen usage.  For someone who is obese a 3.5 mph walk might make them sweat, but probably won't make you sweat.  Still, it's probably a better guess than what you can do.  It's up to you."

nutrition,3dflhl,datalies,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:54:48 2015 UTC,"The nitrogen factor is used to determine the amount of protein in a food. Generally you multiply by 6.25 to get the amount of protein, but it can vary depending on the food, ranging from around 5 to 8.   The standard 6.25 can be lowered by nitrogen that exists outside of protein, and raised because the nitrogen content of specific amino acids varies according to the weight of the amino acid and the number of nitrogen atoms it contains. Both of these vary from food to food.  In any case, you shouldn't need to worry about it, as you already have the protein column which has been calculated using this method."

nutrition,3dflhl,NutriJed,2,Thu Jul 16 07:39:42 2015 UTC,"You multiply the Nitrogen Factor by 6.25 to get the amount of protein. The nitrogen factor won't help you decompose the protein, it's the make up of the protein that determines the variation of the 6.25 multiplier.  Ultimately the nitrogen factor is just how much nitrogen is in the food. This can be used to determine the amount of protein because fats and carbohydrates don't contain nitrogen."
nutrition,3dflhl,NutriJed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:05:11 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. The Nitrogen Factor is 6.25 (generally, but is more precise in the USDA Nutrient Database), and you're saying that I multiply that number by ... the Nutrient Factor. That doesn't make sense to me."
nutrition,3dflhl,NutriJed,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"No the nitrogen factor is how much nitrogen is in the food. You multiply it by 6.25 to get the protein.

Vegetables: Thin slices of some of the lowest quality vegetables that were dehydrated, frozen, and otherwise processed at some point.

And with a lot of cuts you eat around the gristle, hamburger sometimes is gristle....  Though to be fair the real problem with burgers is that they have kind of been super charged and our exercise has been more than cut in half. I would assume a burger that was made more conscientiously and more portion size appropriate would be way healthier. Though this is semantics because these burgers are very rare.   The other issue to is that there is a strong guilt about things that bring enjoyment.

Though this is just my recollection of random remembrances.   Idk if its even small. Part of the issue is that burgers are very part of my culture. When i order one there is an expectation of a large soft refined flour bun, an oily hunk of meat, and a ""cheese"" that is really mostly fat too.

If you look at the recommended daily amounts of Sodium and Potassium, you're supposed to take in almost exactly double the amount of potassium as sodium. The ideal ratio is 2:1, to neutralize the sodium.   It's hardly scientific, but one of the things I've consistently noticed about my body is that if I overdo it for several days on salt, I'll gain a bunch of weight quickly. My assumption was that it was mostly water weight because excess sodium causes water retention.

A lot of the research that has been done on sodium intake and its correlations with disease is actually confounded by the fact that the sodium comes from processed foods--so is it the sodium causing disease, or is it the other ingredients (or lack of nutrients) in processed foods that causes disease?  Give what you eat, I'd be very surprised if you were taking in too much sodium. Eating 2300 mg of sodium is actually pretty difficult if your only (or majority) source of sodium comes from added table salt."

For example, you need at least a few hundred mg of sodium per day and sodium is only found in multivitamins as a salt with an anionic mineral. It's hard to know exactly how much, but there is probably fewer than 2 mg of sodium in this popular multivitamin.

BMR = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) + 5         (man) BMR = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) - 161     (woman)  After you calculate this, you would need to add Calories for weight gain (about 500/day for about 1lb per week)"
nutrition,3d8wf8,anferz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:43:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your extensive answer, appreciate it. :-) I added the information - I am 22 and male. After doing the calculation, I get about 2550 calories and after adding the additional 500 for weight gains, I am at my already calculated 3000calories/day, so I guess that's correct. As I have already stated, I was kind of confused by the high amount of carbs but since I have 2 to 3 times soccer practice additionally to my bodyweight workouts, that high amount of carbs seems fitting."
nutrition,3d8wf8,FrigoCoder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:07:13 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Especially with an intense, endurance based sport like soccer, you will be able to utilize the carbohydrates to help with performance. You are also probably burning significant amounts of Calories between your practices and events, so the extra carbohydrates will be an easy way to increase your overall Calories without making you feel too full. I would suggested something like a sports drink during your practices to help keep you hydrated, but also keep your carbs up - 1 bottle might have around 56g of carbs."

nutrition,3d8wf8,FrigoCoder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is.  I'm a proponent of low carb diets, personally I would not go above 120 grams of carbohydrates a day, for the simple reason that above that, they start to inhibit fat metabolism. You can push this limit by heavy exercise, but even then 200-250 grams still sounds excessive. 500 grams is outright insane.  I'd recommend consuming carbohydrates only around exercise, and having protein and fat rich meals when you are not in the ""anabolic window"".  And I would also plan my macronutrients in a different manner:   Select a carbohydrate limit. Ordinarily I recommend a limit somewhere between 20 and 120 grams. Select 120 grams first, and if you feel you are dying while lifting, increase it a bit. Select a protein target anywhere from 1.4 to 1.8 g/kg. Muscle protein synthesis rates are maximized at 0.8 g/kg for sedentary people, 1.4 g/kg for endurance athletes, 1.8 g/kg for strength athletes. Fill the rest of your calories from fat."

He should be looking for around 5-7g/kg which around 300-430g on normal days and upto 6-10g on intense days (2 a day practices, extra workouts etc) which is around 360-600g carb.  If you factor in his increased Calories for weight gain, he is probably right on target for his carb intake.   There is nothing unhealthy about this, unless he is eating 500g carbs of pop tars, cheese curls and soda and sitting around doing nothing all day."

You could argue that only processed carbohydrates are problematic, but it is sure as hell difficult to get 500 grams of carbohydrates from fruits. And it's playing with fire even in the best case.  You could also argue that exercise pushes carbohydrate tolerance higher, but no way to the 500 gram range, 200-250 maybe. And exercise does not counteract an otherwise poor diet.  Where do you get these numbers from, anyway? Even if we consider the lowest 5 g/kg, that is 400 grams of carbohydrates or 1600 calories for a 80 kg person.

There are different types of DI, each with a different set of causes. The most common type in humans is the neurological form, called Central DI (CDI), which involves a deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The second common type of DI is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), which is due to kidney or nephron dysfunction caused by an insensitivity of the kidneys or nephrons to ADH. DI can also be gestational, or caused by alcohol or some types of drug abuse. DI should not be confused with nocturia.

I am around 180 pounds at 25 years old. I am an avid triathlete though, training upwards of 20 hours a week, so nutrition is super important to me. I will suggest a few ingredients, and the best thing about smoothies is, the prep is more or less two steps!   Place food in blender. Blend!   First, You should get energy from carbs. I recommend frozen fruit and/or cooked oatmeal. I use frozen berries of all kinds, bananas, mangos, cherries, pineapple and peaches. Cooked oatmeal is great for texture.  Second, you'll need a liquid for drinkability, adjusting for your preferred viscosity (sometimes I eat my smoothies with a spoon, sometimes I drink them, depending on how I feel). For this, I recommend almond milk or soy milk or any other nut-based milk. Also, if I don't have milk on hand, I will use the liquid from fresh fruit like apples or oranges, or even then, you can just use water (I did this morning).  Third add longer lasting fats and proteins, I recommend chia seeds, ground flax seeds, or almond butter/peanut butter. Hemp seeds are great as well, very high in fiber and protein.  Optionally, add herbs for extra flavor. For example, on of my favorite smoothies is a mango-banana-basil smoothies with frozen mango, frozen banana, fresh basil, vanilla soy milk, chia seeds and ground flax seeds. Also optional: throw a handful of kale in there for extra fiber. You may also spice up your smoothies with cinnamon or vanilla extract.  The smoothies I make are usually around 32oz and around 600-700 calories. Since you are working outside, I would recommend a bit more, probably between 800-1000. You can add more almond butter or peanut butter to boost the caloric value. The fiber from fruit, fats/proteins, and nutrients would definitely keep you full until lunch. The carbs will give you lasting energy. Not to mention how easy and portable smoothies are!  Good luck!"

I do buy pudding cups or popsicles or ice cream bars or something to indulge on the weekend, but I make sure what I bring in the house is planned out.    Apart from that, I think food is a very real addiction.  This guy is a personal trainer that intentionally gained 70 pounds just to show his clients the right way to lose the weight.  He admitted that food (specifically carbs) became an addiction for him.  The ""bad"" bacteria in our gut thrives on sugar and other crap and will seriously give you cravings and detox symptoms when it isn't being fed.  Healing your gut bacteria is a pretty vital step.  You can do this with probiotics or if it's really a problem you can simply starve it out through fasting (water, not juice.)    I've come to recognize the very real difference between hunger and appetite through fasting.  Sometimes my stomach is growling and physically hurts due to hunger, but I have no desire to eat.  Sometimes I feel perfectly fine but just want to cram some chocolate in my gullet.  Then of course there's real hunger when you feel weak and your body seriously needs energy.  It's important to know the difference and listen to your body's cues.  We are conditioned to go through periods of hunger.  Humans have been doing it for centuries.  In today's convenient world we've stopped thinking about it, never really go hungry and have come to believe it's bad to.  We think it's bad for us to feel hunger, when in fact it's the exact opposite."

nutrition,3d82ih,LEE_FORDHAM46,3,Tue Jul 14 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"Are you visiting NYC? If so, you can get so many healthy options from restaurants. I suggest you always start with a fresh salad before every meal and make sure the dressing is on the side. For main meals you can always ask for low carb options in NYC. But just try to order some lean protein with some steamed veggies. Always ask the waiters how the meat or veggies are cooked and you can always ask for steam or baked options. If you crave dessert, I highly recommend you hit up on those raw food restaurants. NYC has so many raw food places and you can get super delicious but healthy raw desserts.   But honestly you should really enjoy your vacation. You probably don't get to go to NYC very often and when you say you should focus on enjoy yourself and worry about your weight later. Remember fitness is a journey not a sprint :-) Hopefully this helps."

Toxins can come from food or water, from chemicals used to grow or prepare food, and even from the air that we breathe. So, in essence any caffeine, alcohol, refined sugars, flours, artificial colours, flavours, preservatives, sweeteners, chemical pesticides, lead, mercury and other heavy metals, BPA (from plastic containers), and anything else from our environment that our bodies find 'toxic'."

There is a very real benefit to cleansing and detoxing the body.....however the body is very good at doing this itself if given half a chance! That basically involves stop polluting it with massive amount of toxins in the first place....  Toxins are everywhere from the air we breath, the stress we cause ourselves in our jobs and lives, the environment we live in and of course the food we eat. To detox / cleanse effectively we just need to remove or limit some of these.... as 'CaptainGulliver' says - eat healthy (and normally less - IF helps greatly), get some regular exercise, drink plenty of water and help clear your mind of stress - meditation is a good idea! - treat the mind and body as one.

nutrition,3d7ue6,gojinutrition,2,Tue Jul 14 07:20:31 2015 UTC,"Apologies ...that was more of a rhetorical question. I just don't really know what value these have in a detox / cleanse program. Also the feeling of hunger is not generated by the stomach but in actual fact by the brain. This is in response to depletion of nutrients in the body needed to feed it and carry out vital functions as opposed to the amount or mass of food stuff in the stomach itself running low or when the stomach becomes empty.  Back on subject - The type of detoxing I recommend to clients follows the lines of...  Using Intermittent fasting (16:8) - This is good as you only eat for 8 hours a day and then have nothing but water for the next 16 hours...in short this allows the body chance to rest from all that digestion of food and aids in its natural ability to detoxify itself. In reality this just means skipping breakfast for most people. Beginning their eating phase at midday and stopping at 2000hrs.  Foods to eat during the eating phase include; Fish, Fresh vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, peas, sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, etc Fruit such as apples, oranges, pears, grapefruit, grapes Salad vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, celery, spring onions  You need to greatly restrict the consumption of; Potatoes, bananas and other âstarchyâ vegetables.  Taking supplements specifically designed to cleanse the gut and intestines of candida and eliminate parasites, then repopulate with beneficial healthy bacteria are also extremely beneficial.

nutrition,3d3vtl,drive27,9,Mon Jul 13 08:54:11 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely more than one way to promote stable blood sugar! Of course you can have it both, unless you have a gluten or dairy sensitivity there is absolutely no reason (except maybe ethical) to cut either of them out. What has proven most effective for stabile blood sugar levels are high fiber intake, consuming adequate protein, including omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids and also some saturated fats from grass fed butter or coconut oil, etc. in reasonable amounts, adequate hydration and keeping carbohydrates reasonably moderate (not necessarily low) only mostly from whole food sources, beans/lentils/legumes, fruits, starchy veggies, whole grains within serving size. Additionally, some tweaks like adding probiotics or spices like cinnamon (containing cinnamaldehyde and in the Cassia variety also coumerin - never overdo on Cassia, though), clovespice, allspice, tumeric, ginger, pepper, etc. or drinking coffe or green tea and going for a short walk after a big meal have been proven effective in blood sugar control.   Some foods especially may have an extra regulatory effect like the coumarin in Cassia cinnamon, although that one's a bit two faced, but avocado for example contains some heptoses that act as hexokinase inhibitor (hexokinase is the first irreversibly step of glycolysis, as it phosphorylates the glucose in the cell so that it cannot simply diffund back out of the cell, into the blood stream), positively affecting blood sugar. A similar mechanism is known with beans, however amylase inhibitors are what makes for it in that case, (partially) inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of bean starch. The latter is not considered paleo, but still has this effect.  Also, there's nothing wrong with whole grains, just make sure you really stick to the recommanded serving sizes if blood sugar control is your primary goal. And this is just my opinion, but a boiled or roasted white potato will almost always beat out a serving of grain nutritionally and taste-wise.  Other than that, moderation is what makes a diet good. Keeping a whole-foods diet centered around fresh produce, quality protein, healthy fats and oils, the occasional starchy foods or dairy 85% of the time will do more good to you than being perfect in keeping your restrictions but missing out on the cultural and social experiences that are inevitably tied with foods and drinks."

Also, compared to grains, they have far less calories and starch per 100g and more water, which means if you eat either of them at the same volume or weight, a potato will have less impact on you anyway, also meaning your blood sugar. They have also been ranked one of the most satiating food, probably due to their resistant starch content, which also feeds gut bacteria in a similar way that fiber does. All of these reasons might have had something to do with your certain reaction to it (especially on a ketogenic diet, where the kind of carbohydrate and absorption it matters disproportionately more than moderate/normal carb) or you might nor have a good reaction to potatoes, but simply a bad reaction to those grains.

Mannoheptulose has been reported to inhibit insulin secretion from pancreas.  This inhibition occurs because when mannoheptulose is present the glycolysis is inhibited (because there is no production of glucose-6-P) therefore no increase in ATP concentration which is required to close the KATP channel in the beta cells of the pancreas causing a diminution of calcium entry and insulin secretion.

Sweet potato is a great chioce for carbs and it will also give you a load of fiber, although the easiest way to get in fiber would probably be any vegetable, but especially leafy greens, but also fruits or legumes. Some beans also contain high amounts ofc zinc, but if you don't buy canned, their preperation is sort of lengthy with soaking and all. For a real boost of zinc, seafood could be what you're looking for especially oysters! They're incredibly high in zinc, but so are lean beef (though nearly not as high), cashews and grains like oats or quinoa.  As for probiotics, make sure your yoghurt actually says contains live cultures of the lactobacterium and bifidus strain, or try something like fresh sauerkraut and maybe even kimchi, they're both great and usually easy to digest.  It depends on how much honey you're using but you probabaly won't be killing yourself. Have you tried replacing the honey with a banana? It's great for texture and sweetnes!

It matters what it does to me.  I'm on paleo and I avoid grains, but I eat plenty of potatoes.  My gut was always on the fritz before I added them, but grains and beans give me problems.  If you have gut problems, most people on paleo will recommend you limit potatoes, but they make my gut just work.  You need to find what works for you."

If 12 hours elapses from waking up and I haven't eaten, I should eat something small and clean. Make sure to drink plenty of water. Eventually my hunger signals came back normally by the third morning. They were weak but they were there which was more than I could say for the few years leading up to that point.

I lost a couple lbs from water weight/bloat and put about half of them on again once I started eating normally, but that's normal for any kind of fast. There are a few studies being done showing the health and longevity effects of fasting, so I wouldn't be scared as its not a true fast because you're eating at LEAST once per day.

nutrition,3d5lei,Life-in-Death,5,Mon Jul 13 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I am still not seeing any really leafy greens besides the one ounce of spinach.  So, my analysis:  The Bad:    Breakfast is pretty crap.  This is basically your SAD that is low in micronutrients.  Processed meat, potatoes, cheese.    This should be your once a week hangover food.  Lunch is not much better:  Flour tortillas are refined flours with either lard or transfats.  Go for corn tortillas, the ones without all the gum additives.  They are whole grain with no crap added.    I love tacos with black beans, guac, salsa, sometimes adding sweet potatoes and/or kale.  You have more cheese, then grits.  Grits are often refined (bran is lost) and I don't know how you prepared them, but they often are made with a lot of butter and cheese, etc.    Snack isn't horrible.  Goldfish are.  Refined grains, refined oils.  Chobani is full of added sugar.    What type of peanut butter are you using?  Dinner:  I am guessing Firecracker chicken and fries isn't super healthy.   French fries?    Green beans aren't veggie powerhouses.  The Good:  A bit of spinach and mushrooms.    Fruit and perhaps the peanut butter.  What are some changes?    Have some veggie-rich meals:  Huge romaine salad with beans, nuts, and anything else you like.     Instead of the goldfish, try homemade baked corn tortilla chips with guac or hummus.    Make baked chickpeas.   Buy soy nuts (dried edamame).  Have chopped veggies and hummus.     You have to add the greens I mentioned in the first comment.  Also try to add berries to your fruit selection.    Do you like oatmeal for breakfast?  You can add berries, nuts, protein powder, etc.    Go for yogurt without added sugar, stir in berries for sweetness.    Make sure your peanut butter has zero added oils.    Try split pea soup, black bean chili, etc.   Overall: avoid refined grains, refined oils, processed meats, a lot of cheese, fried foods.  Don't use peas/carrots/green beans in place of other green veggies.    Edit: I just saw your goal is to lose weight, I assumed it was working out/bulking. from what I saw here with that breakfast, etc.  I would have been a little more stronger in my advice then!    The base of your meals should be high-nutrient, low calorie.  You eat a ton, feel full, get nutrients, lose weight and no crap.  Some things I love are cauliflower mashed potatoes (without the cream and butter, add roasted garlic, a little soy salt/broth, S&P), eat marinated broiled portobello mushrooms for steak.   Try Ezekiel bread.  The English Muffins, toasted are my favorite for breakfast.  SautÃ©e greens and beans for great dishes.  You can go Italian with lemon and chili flakes, you can go Asian with soy and sesame"
nutrition,3d5lei,Life-in-Death,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks for the feedback! I appreciate the time you put into it.  The firecracker chicken is panko crusted chicken breast with a buffalo sauce and the other dinner is chicken breasts, tamari, green onion, carribean spices, pineapple, red diced pepper, jalapeno. The dinners come from a company called Let's Dish they essentially provide you with all of the ingredients and you package/prepare the meal onsite and can freeze it for a later date.   You're certainly right about the breakfast being hangover food I'll have to make some adjustments there next week to clean it up.  The Snacks are meant to be integrated into any meal or when I am hungry.  I think I should cut down on the sugary foods like the yogurt and chobani and replace them w some veggies.  The yogurt was more a way to get more protein into the diet but you're right it comes with a good bit of sugar.  Either way thank you for the detailed response you would not believe how many ppl just say screw it and try to meet your macros or something...  Next week I will definitely factor in some of your advice."

Pork shoulder is hella cheap and awesome when cooked in a slowcooker for a long time.   Assuming you have a freezer, buy a bunch of frozen fish and/or cheap meat at once and freeze that shit and you're good to go. Do you know anyone with a Costco membership you can kinda mooch on? Offer to pay them gas or something, it'll be so worth it.  Also eggs! y no eggs? They are a fantastic source of cheap protein and other good shit like omega-3 and choline.

However, with time, he rejected that lifestyle as well as he found that depriving the body and mind, as he was doing, was an impediment to spiritual enlightenment, therefore, he settled on what Buddhists call the ""Middle Way"", which was designed to be neither hedonistic nor austere. Because there are no early sources of Buddha's exact words, various branches have interpreted the stories in various ways emphasizing differing balances of fasting and avoiding certain pleasures."

If he fasted to reach some sort of mental state, he definitely seeked this state.  However, fasting is not the best way to achieve it. Fasting is not sustainable, and you lose muscle mass, electrolytes, and nutrients by fasting. You need several weeks to reach full adaptation to ketosis, which is very risky with fasting.

It is characterised by serum concentrations of ketone bodies over 0.5 millimolar, with low and stable levels of insulin and blood glucose.   It is almost always generalized with hyperketonemia, that is, an elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood throughout the body. Ketone bodies are formed by ketogenesis when liver glycogen stores are depleted (or from metabolising medium-chain triglycerides ). The main ketone bodies used for energy are acetoacetate and Î²-hydroxybutyrate,  and the levels of ketone bodies are regulated mainly by insulin and glucagon.  Most cells in the body can use both glucose and ketone bodies for fuel, and during ketosis, free fatty acids and glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis) fuel the remainder.

nutrition,3d1f55,buxton210,5,Sun Jul 12 23:41:11 2015 UTC,"Graduated in May, too.   What kind of research opportunities were there?   This is specific to the institution (what facilities are available) and professor (their interests and the grants they obtain).   What are you or you peers looking to do with your phd?   A PhD is a research degree. Many of my peers have gone on to post doc work or faculty positions; others have become research scientists.    what did an average week look like as far as time spent working vs. Free time?   This also depends on your advisor and your funding situation. You may have obligations as a teaching assistant or research assistant as well as classes and your own project(s). I never really kept track of time, but know that I had to make myself take a day off each week so I wouldn't get burnt out. With that said, if you are willing to work 16 hours a day in the lab no one will stop you. (To be clear, I am not saying I worked 16 hours a day in the lab or was I expected to work 16 hours a day; my point is that [some] profs aren't going to stop you from working.)"
nutrition,3d1f55,richardludwig,3,Mon Jul 13 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"Research opportunities: Our department was quite large and so there were a large number of research opportunities, from lots of different aspects of nutrition. I completed my PhD in applied nutrition, specifically community, and my dissertation was on the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program.  Our department has many more faculty/students who work in lab science, with a broad range of research areas. I can be more specific if you want me to.  What are you or your peers looking to do with your PhD?  I think this depended on research area-- I received a faculty position immediately after graduation. Of the last 5 students who have graduated with their PhDs with the applied in our program, 4 of us received a faculty position within 6 months of graduating. The remaining student went back and is completing her dietetic internship.  Those students who work in the lab typically have gone on to completing post docs. I am not as familiar with their paths after that time.   What did an average week look like as far as time spent working vs. free time?  I worked constantly! I had the luxury of working a lot from home  (except when I was collecting data) because I was more of the applied nutrition, although I was still probably putting in 70-80 hours per week (partially because of restrictions I put on myself on wanting to graduate quickly). Some of that time also was from the class I taught, and since I am an RD, I did keep up with a few clients each month.  Now that I am graduated and ""just"" have my faculty position, I actually feel a lot less stress than I did previously. My weekends are actually weekends... and when I go home from work, I'm actually relaxing and not working usually, and it is an amazing feeling!   Something I will say: Before I started the PhD, I knew it was going to be a lot of hard work, but because I already had a strong background in nutrition (both a BS and MS in nutrition), I wasn't really thinking about all the NEW information there still was for me to learn/discover. So, I was quite surprised at how HARD it actually was as well. So my first couple of years during coursework were quite challenging for me, and I considered quitting numerous times. However, once my coursework was done and I finished both quals and comps, it was really just the research that was left, and I did feel less pressure. It was back to ""just"" being hard work.   One last comment: if you go the applied nutrition route, I would encourage you to get your RD ahead of time. You will have many, many job opportunities. If you go the lab science route, it probably isn't as important for you to have the RD.   I hope this helps, and please let me know any other questions you have!"

I am convinced beyond any doubt that this PhD is what I want to do, but I was a little worried when I keep hearing different PhDs talk about how they had no time for anything ever, and that everything sucked while they were getting their PhD. I have a very active and healthy lifestyle and fear that, ironically enough, getting a PhD in nutrition will hinder it. Any input on that?   i.e. could you exercise regularly, sleep regularly, cook regularly, have some free time on the weekend? Basically, did you still live a semi-normal and healthy life while getting a PhD in Nutrition?"
nutrition,3d1f55,fitwithmindy,2,Mon Jul 13 12:16:08 2015 UTC,"I absolutely made certain I could exercise regularly! I put this as a priority. I made sure I did at least an hour per day. My department was quite active and healthy, so a number of students did this.   I don't really cook a ton, and  this was more of a struggle for me. I'd prepare meals on Sundays, but cooking is just something I really don't enjoy. If it's something you make a priority for, you'll have enough time most likely.   Sleep: Sleep is another priority of mine, so I tried to make sure I got about 8 hours per night. :)   Free time on weekend: Depending on where I was at in my program, this one was more of a challenge. I generally spent most of my weekends working: often grading, studying, or catching up on what I wasn't able to do over the week. I would try to put in 20 or so hours per weekend on school. I think I worked more on weekends than a lot of my department, but this enabled me to graduate sooner as well. To prevent total burnout, my husband and I would take at least one trip out of state (and sometimes out of the country) per semester. We wouldn't have been able to travel as much had we relied solely on my stipend and income, though.   Overall, if you go the PhD route, you'll have to prioritize what is most important to you, but you will likely have time for those you put first after your school work.

Even if you hate veggies, I'd try and find a way to get them in there. i.e. I blend eggs and spinach together to make scrambled eggs, and eat that. It makes the spinach quite well. I mean, I'd make that a goal. It isn't a ""necessity"" but it is a good ""filler"" food, and it provides vital fiber and vitamins.  C. Make sure you take in a good amount of protein. This will help spare your muscles.   D. I usually take out fruits when I am cutting, cause I try to remove most sugars, but i also cut for competitions. Cutting for health, you could leave your fruits in there, just keep moderate. Depending on the fruit, the sugar can be up there.  E. Even if you are busy, prep! Grab a protein shake/protein bar before you head out. Pre make your meals if you will be at school all day. I mean, that is the worst part about being healthy in my opinion. But it works. You get out what you put in.  Ideas: Make scrambled eggs with ham and spinach and heat that up for 30-45 seconds. I think it tastes fine.  Protein Bar/Protein Shake  Cheese is a good source of fat and protein! (and yummy)  Rice can be made in bulk, and reheated and brought wherever. That is a good carb source, longer energy. Stuff like that.  Hope that helps some. I'm not exactly sure of your requirements or how much you are wanting to put in to it.

Snacking on nuts and seeds is perfect. Having large green salad everyday is stellar. You're better off with grains, beans, and veggies instead of the egg at lunch. You can get more nutrients and less cholesterol/saturated fat/antioxidants/harmful components that way.   For dinner, rice and beans is great - but try different grains and different types of beans for more variety, and add some veggies. Reduce or eliminate the animal products. They are not providing you any nutrients (aside from B12 - just take a supplement) that plants don't do a better job of providing, and they have the harmful components that you don't want.  Variety is key - switch things up - different fruits every morning, different greens in your smoothies and salads, different nuts and seeds for snacks, different grains and beans in your lunch and dinner.

All those diets do are cause your body to eat your muscle tissues to come up with the difference of what your body needs to function. Then, overtime your body slows down its metabolism which leads to a higher body fat %. What will happen if you continue is that you will end up skinny fat, with bags of lose skin and a general unhealthy look. And then when you resume eating a normal caloric intake you would just become even fatter than before because of the slower metabolism and smaller muscle mass.  To lose body fat you just have to eat higher quality foods than you were before, and possible more food than you were eating before to increase your metabolism. Then you gain muscle mass which lowers body fat% while your hormones can correct and lower water weight retention.  Paleo is a pretty unhealthy diet so I would scrap that and focus on eating high quality foods:  Fruit Juice, especially Orange Juice Fruits Milk Coffee Cheese Gelatin Low fat seafood Eggs Organic Ice Cream Potatoes Rice Refined flours (not whole grains) Ruminant animals (cow, bison, ect, their livers as well) Coconut Oil Butter  You should eat as much food as you require to become full.

A study by Joseph Proietto, a professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne, took 50 overweight men and 50 overweight women and put them on a 550 calorie diet for eight weeks. Then, over the next year, participants were given counseling to encourage healthy eating habits.  Though participants typically lost weight over the eight week diet, most regained a substantial amount of it over the next year and many reported feeling hungrier and more food obsessed than before the diet.  That's because, according to the study, the participants' brains released hormones making them feel like they were starving. Their metabolisms also slowed and more of the food they ate was stored as fat. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/25/why-diets-dont-work-long-term-cause-weight-gain_n_1452875.html)"

Your body is super great at digesting things, so don't worry about being sick. I checked your post on /r/fitness also and the recommendations on there are good. They mentioned fiber, which would be a pretty big change for you, so you might have some interesting bowel movements in the first few days, but shouldn't be anything too unpleasant.  Small increments is a good idea. One of my friends is currently trying to introduce healthier foods into her lifestyle. She's had a lot of success with small changes - she's stopped asking for no tomatoes in her restaurant orders, she'll usually take the side salad and at least take a few bites, and she even made her own curry the other day with potatoes, carrots, and green beans.

nutrition,3cyeeb,Blumpkin_Queen,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"Hi! So I used to be a lot like you, and several things have really made a difference for me. I actually enjoy most fruits now.   Buy seasonally. Seasonal fruit (local if you can), tastes WAY better than fruit that's been picked before ripe, shipped across the world, and then forced to ripen. The flavor difference is enormous. I never realized this until the past strawberry season - I thought my taste buds magically changed - nope, just the way fruit is supposed to taste! If the fruit you want isn't in season, buy frozen and thaw. The texture will be affected, but you will have full flavor.   Next, I really forced myself to eat fruit every day, and was conscientious of my goals to consume more fruit. This is when I accidentally had a perfectly ripe and in-season strawberry (as mentioned above).   More importantly, I really made an effort to reduce the amount of added sugars in my life. Because my buds were so used to a sugar storm every day, they couldn't appreciate (or even detect) the subtle sweetness and complexities involved with real fruit. Cleansing the palette has really helped me to change the way I eat and approach produce. Certain flavors, like sour, are more appreciated now. This has effected my diet overall, as well.   Lastly, learn to cook/prepare your fruits to enhance the flavor. Bell peppers concentrate beautifully when sautÃ©ed or roasted; I never enjoyed a bell pepper until I learned to cook one. Blending fruit with water into a smoothie can help to eliminate textural/volume challenges. Pairing an apple with peanut butter adds a salty-sweet element. Cucumber and hummus. Strawberries and chocolate. Frozen grapes. Etc."

They literally deodorize it before bottling it.  I don't want fats like that in my body because they'll be used to make cells that are oxidized.  Oxidized cholesterol gets embedded in artery walls and oxidized fats don't have the same function as unoxidized fats.  I eat whole food and I stopped stressing long ago about the breakdown of my fats as long as it came from a whole food source (e.g. eggs, fish, nuts, seeds, avocado, coconut, olive).  Whole food has so many more benefits than just the fat/vitamin/mineral breakdown that we know about.  You can't supplement your way out of a bad diet."

A few searches will confirm that a decade or so ago most work on the nitrate content of vegetables was by people concerned that the nitrate content of some vegetables might be harmful and now much work is by people who have proved that the nitrate content of some vegetables at least improves athletic performance, and probably contributes to general health."

nutrition,3cvpgj,voodoodudu,8,Sat Jul 11 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"Simple: all those foods have different amounts of lactose in them.  Since your body doesn't produce adequate amounts of the enzyme required to digest lactose, your gut microbes consume this lactose instead which causes gas, diarrhea, and other problems.  The more lactose you consume, the worse this effect is going to be.  That's why you can handle eating dairy foods with very low levels of lactose (such as butter) without any noticeable problems.  As for the specific foods you mentioned:  Ice cream is typically made with only the fat/cream portion of milk, which has lower-levels of lactose -- only ~3g of lactose per 100g.  Prepared ice creams have a lactose range of 3-8g per 100g, so it entirely depends on the preparation methods (check the ingredients, if it contains milk or dried milk, or any other milk product other than cream, it's going to have higher levels of lactose).   Milk has 5g of lactose per 100g, this is why it seems much worse than some ice creams: it has nearly double the amount of lactose.   There's a huge range for cheeses.  Hard, aged cheeses typically have very low levels of lactose (under 2g per 100g, and some as low as .11g/trace), non-aged, softer cheeses typically have lactose levels similar to milk or cream (3-5g) and concentrated cheeses with no fermentation like Velveeta and American have lactose levels of 9g or higher (even up to 15g).    If you want to check the lactose levels for various other foods for yourself, that info can be found here:  Lactose Percentages of Dairy Products -- www.stevecarper.com  or here, which has the raw data used to make the table in the above link:  Lactose content of milk and milk products -- The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  You can also look up the nutrition info for various food products on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (or any nutrition website based on that database such as http://nutritiondata.self.com) and check the lactose amounts there as well.  For example, here's the page for cream on the USDA's website, scroll down a bit to the lactose row, and you can see cream has 3.21g of lactose per 100g."

Writeup / Summary  - This might help you find more things you can look up, like the overfeeding experiment done in a Vermont prison.  I did a quick search on it and there are articles and book previews on google books that talk about overfeeding experiments that might pique your interest.  Some points from the summary:   This study replicates an earlier experiment conducted in 1967 at Vermont State Prison. Prisoners were offered early release if they could achieve 25% increase in their body weight. Although many inmates did achieve this target, a small handful seemed unable to gain enough weight. One remained resolutely stuck at 18% increase, even when eating 10000 calories a day. This seemed to suggest that for some individuals becoming obese was actually impossible.   ....   The results of Nystromâs study confirmed the results of the Vermont study. Volunteers varied in the amount of weight they put on. Interestingly, one individual showed a 30% increase in his basal metabolic rate, which was attributed to the fact that he had laid down additional muscle rather than fat (which is believed to depend on genetic factors, though these are not discussed). A researcher also explains that some of the participants may have unconsciously resisted weight gain by fidgeting more. Other volunteers also found it physically difficult to eat the required daily calorie intake. Hormones in the body can act protectively to increase the âfullnessâ sensation and therefore prevent individuals from eating more food.   ...   After the experiment the volunteers found it relatively easy to lose the weight, without having to diet. Leibel has shown that this is due to the body retaining a memory of the âcorrectâ body weight. In obese individuals this means that on losing a large amount of weight the body will constantly try to return back to the âcorrectâ larger weight. However in the slim volunteers the body is able to easily return it back to its original starting weight."
nutrition,3cu2t6,slampropp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"On the Vermont Prison Experiment:  Genes Take Charge, and Diets Fall by the Wayside    It began with studies that were the inspiration of Dr. Ethan Sims at the University of Vermont, who asked what would happen if thin people who had never had a weight problem deliberately got fat.  His subjects were prisoners at a nearby state prison who volunteered to gain weight. With great difficulty, they succeeded, increasing their weight by 20 percent to 25 percent. But it took them four to six months, eating as much as they could every day. Some consumed 10,000 calories a day, an amount so incredible that it would be hard to believe, were it not for the fact that there were attendants present at each meal who dutifully recorded everything the men ate.  Once the men were fat, their metabolisms increased by 50 percent. They needed more than 2,700 calories per square meter of their body surface to stay fat but needed just 1,800 calories per square meter to maintain their normal weight.  When the study ended, the prisoners had no trouble losing weight. Within months, they were back to normal and effortlessly stayed there.  The implications were clear. There is a reason that fat people cannot stay thin after they diet and that thin people cannot stay fat when they force themselves to gain weight.

Fat is kept to a minimum because it is counterproductive to your goal with a refeed.  Since you are overeating on carbs, any fat taken in is pretty much going to just be stored as you are in a caloric surplus.  There are explicit reasons to incorporate a refeed.  This is not a cheat day / cheat meal thing.  A refeed is an actual thing utilized by those that tend to be leaner or are dieting with restricted carbs / resistance training / going through periods of glycogen depletion and saturation with the attempt of - for example - body recomposition.

nutrition,3ct79n,Insamity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"As with any addiction, it takes time to develop. The longer it goes on the more addictive it will be. Sugars are the simplest/quickest energy for the body. Our brain has a reward system which is activated by thousands of actions, experiences, foods, etc. Food that we like causes the release of  dopamine in the brain which is its natural response. High sugar foods are a variation of a natural food. So when someone is constantly eating high sugar and high fat foods that are calorie dense it triggers a high amount of dopamine in the brain. This causes other foods that are not high calories, high sugar, high fat, etc, to not be as rewarding because the brain has begun adapting. (it takes more stimulus to create the same effect) This is the exact same adaptation the brain makes when pornography is viewed. It isn't natural for the brain and it soon takes more and more stimulus to achieve the same response. Hopefully that made sense! So yes sugar is addictive"
nutrition,3ct79n,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"I think when taken into account the type of influence that gut flora have on mood and behavior the answer would actually be, yes.  We may be several years away from a thorough understanding of the influences microbial life has on human behavior but there is evidence even now that these types of foods cause much the same effect within the gut as narcotics do within the brain.  Surely there is more research that needs to be done to understand how the gut communicates and how and why gut flora influences our behavior but there is no question of its effects.  Binge eating is a neurotic disorder but there is plenty evidence that some eating habits exhibit the same symptoms and behaviors as drug addiction and have a clear physical dependency component.  In any case if you find that your eating habits are self destructive and you feel helpless to change them it would be advisable to seek professional help.  Very few things are as destructive as long term poor eating habits."

nutrition,3csxbz,StuWard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:33 2015 UTC,"OK.  I was worried you were looking for some mystical enlightenment or something.   That article suggests cutting calories but not going to zero.   In fact, they don't even go as low as you suggest.  The first thing that happens in a fast, is that glycogen in the liver is called upon for energy.  You can get to this stage by just cutting calories in half for a day,  exercising for an hour or more, or going 8 hours or more between meals.  In my opinion, the benefit comes during the refeed, when you replenish your glycogen.  It's this limited fast/feast cycle that is healthy.  IF is based on this cycle and there are a number of different types but they all include glycogen depletion followed by replenishment.    Edit:  An analogy is exercise.  You create a stimulous that cause micro-trauma to your muscles.  During recovery,  you rebuild the damaged tissue stronger than it was before.  Over time, you become stronger.  However, if you go too hard, you can cause permanent damage.  Likewise, glycogen depletion/replenishment causes damage and rebuilding your mitochondria.  Too much causes permanent damage, but the appropriate amount causes strengthening."
nutrition,3csxbz,StuWard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"So basically when you do a water fast for 4 days and then refeed (e.g. 5000 calorie refeed), most of the calories are used to replenish glycogen with minimal fat gain? Is there glycogen supercompensation?  I notice that eating in s small surplus every day results in more fat gain then eating in a huge surplus on one day and eating on a huge calorie deficit the other days."
nutrition,3csxbz,StuWard,3,Fri Jul 10 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"If you do a water fast for 4 days and then refeed, you've gone too far.  Your glycogen was used long ago and now you're burning muscle to provide glucose to your brain.  Properly managed, you will enter ketosis and use ketones to fuel your brain and you should look into books by Stephen Phinney.    Following your 4 day fast, you glycogen will be replenished quickly with little fat gain but following days may be different.  In the long term, your metabolism will have lowered due to the muscle loss you've experience.     Is there glycogen supercompensation?   Not from a 4-day fast.  16-24 hourse might have given you that effect but 4 days would have gone too far.    I notice that eating in s small surplus every day results in more fat gain then eating in a huge surplus on one day and eating on a huge calorie deficit the other days.   Yest, alternating surplus and deficit day by day is a valid way to do it.  You will get that cycle of fast and feast in a manageble context. If you coordinate it with your training, surplus on heavy lifting days, deficit on recovery or cardio days, you will get the supercompensation youÃ¨re looking for.  Look up the Zig Zag Diet by Fred Hatfield (Dr. Squat)."

Sounds like a similar approach. My dad is like that and is very healthy. One of my doctors eats like that, too. Says he feels better on an empty stomach, so he eats in the evening before bed and just drinks water all day. Or yerba mate, which has a tiny amount of calories.  /u/MakesTooMuchSense says you'll miss out on other micro/macronutrients, but not necessarily. If you plan the diet to hit 98% of your micronutrients, macronutrients, and calories in the single meal, then just eat carrots to account for the other 2% and stay satiated or give your mouth something to do the rest of the day, then I don't see the problem. It also isn't that far off from an intermittent fasting kind of diet, especially if you span that single meal out over a few hours or something.  Though one thing to watch out for when eating a lot of carrots is vitamin A toxicity (carotenemia). The body converts carotene to vitamin A, then stores it in mainly in your palms and feet. You'll know when you start to get this because your body will start to turn orange. Not a concern if you eat a few carrots a day, but if you're eating pounds of them, you'll turn orange pretty quickly. So you might find something other than carrots to snack on. Source: I'm a web developer and snacked on baby carrots like this during the work day, and turned orange after like a week. I didn't really care, but my doctor was like, ""dude, you gotta stop eating carrots. you're turning into an oompa loompa."" He did, however, give me a blood test that showed my Vitamin A levels were fine, and said it was just a cosmetic thing."

I'm assuming that's what OP would do, and wouldn't undereat by only eating one ""regular"" meal, then not eating the rest of the day. That would be horrible.  In many ways the one meal a day thing is actually easier. My doctor says he does it out of simplicity. Just one meal to prep, track, and eat.

When I was obese and started losing weight I had hunger, which obese people does not usually have because of the eating habits.  With little, subtle yet constant changes I was able to eat healthier.

nutrition,3csbqc,cupcakeraynebowjones,0,Fri Jul 10 17:25:57 2015 UTC,"Well, one reason is that the central nervous system and red blood cells can only breakdown glucose for energy. And as we can certainly make glucose from amino acids and fats (gluconeogenesis) this process uses oxeloacetate, which is needed for the kreb's cycle to initiate. Therefore, if you have too much gluconeogenesis taking place, you will have low oxeloacetate, a build up of acetyl-coa (because it is unable to enter the kreb's cycle), and in turn a ketone bodies formation (ketogenesis), which is toxic, leading to ketosis. We see this often happening to diabetic clients; when their cells can't get to the glucose in the blood they start making their own.  As of how long I don't know to be honest."
nutrition,3csbqc,folderol,3,Fri Jul 10 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"Well, one reason is that the central nervous system and red blood cells can only breakdown glucose for energy.    The brain can use ketones for 50-75% of its energy requirements. It only requires around 30 grams of glucose, which is easily met by gluconeogenesis.  Even with zero dietary carbohydrate intake, glucose and energy requirements will be met, given enough protein and fat.   And as we can certainly make glucose from amino acids and fats (gluconeogenesis) this process uses oxeloacetate, which is needed for the kreb's cycle to initiate. Therefore, if you have too much gluconeogenesis taking place, you will have low oxeloacetate, a build up of acetyl-coa (because it is unable to enter the kreb's cycle), and in turn a ketone bodies formation (ketogenesis)   Protein replenishes oxaloacetate. This is why excess protein can kick people out of ketosis. This is also the reason there is so much difficulty balancing ketone production and protein intake of epileptic children: Too much protein and they start having seizures. Too little protein, and their growth becomes stunted.   which is toxic, leading to ketosis. We see this often happening to diabetic clients; when their cells can't get to the glucose in the blood they start making their own.   Ketones are not toxic. Dietary ketosis is completely benign.  You are thinking of diabetic ketoacidosis. It is characterized by the failure of insulin secretion, and the unregulated production and release of glucose and ketones. Ketone levels are orders of magnitude higher than during dietary ketosis. At those levels they start to overwhelm compensatory mechanisms, especially combined with other complications of inadequate insulin secretion.  Contrast this with normal blood glucose levels compared to ten times as much glucose in the blood."
nutrition,3csbqc,SheFightsHerShadow,5,Fri Jul 10 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Ketosis and ketoacidosis are not the same thing.  Ketoacidosis is the dangerous toxic state. Ketosis is a normal biological process, and by itself does not lead to ketoacidosis."

Glucose is not the actual energy source, ATP is.  I don't understand what you mean by seeing toxic ketosis in diabetic ""clients"" (whatever they are) while at the same time they are creating glucose through gluconeogenesis because their cells ""can't get at the glucose in their blood""?  Where is this blood glucose coming from if they are in ketosis?  I'm no expert but what you are saying makes no sense."

nutrition,3cr9jm,_Alibaba_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:24:04 2015 UTC,"There are too many factors to venture guesses in terms specific timeframes, but the simplest way to think about it is to base it on the amount of glycogen you have.  Having the sports drink and bagel a few hours ahead of time is essentially carb loading and only makes sense if you've depleted some glycogen. The idea is to have a full tank before you leave.  There are also sports gels and other things that people take during long races and the point of that is to try to regenerate some of your stores on the run.   Assuming you haven't done much rigorous exercise, there really isn't a point to load up on crappy carbs like the sugar in sports drinks.  If you consume sugars and carbs when your glycogen is full, it doesn't necessarily guaranty it will be converted to fat. There are certain ways that the glucose can be absorbed on the fly without needing to tap into the tank or store it. The biggest determining factor of what happens is the dose and speed of absorption of the carb.   Fiber slows down the absorption of carbs, which helps out for people who aren't very good at handling large surges of glucose (those are the ones that end up over-secereting insulin, which leads to a host of problems long-term). Many people are in this camp, which is why so many health professionals harp on eating whole foods that are high in fiber."
nutrition,3cr9jm,crab_shak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:29:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure about the timeline but it's a lot more complicated, especially with sugars than just getting turned to fats.  The way your body initially stores sugars is in the polymer form of glycogen.  It's a much quicker energy source than fats.  Insulin has an opposing hormone called glucagon and when blood sugar drops and one hasn't eaten to replenish blood sugar levels, glucagon catabolizes glycogen stores for faster energy than fat break down.  If you don't eat a lot of carbs/sugar, your body will use up glycogen stores within about 12 hours and will move on to using primarily proteins and amino acids to make glucose through complex metabolic pathways/gluconeogenesis/etc.  After about a week of doing this with no sugars/carbs ingested, the body will actually start breaking down fats a lot more for energy.  In order to fuel the brain, which previously ran on glucose, the body will start creating ketone bodies which circulate in the blood.  This is the state people are talking about when they are saying ""ketosis"".  These ketone bodies are also acidic.  Well, I dunno if that was the answer you were looking for but that's all I know! Hope that was good information :)"
nutrition,3coa47,JBGNY89,10,Thu Jul 9 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"Lactose intolerance is your inability to pick up the sugar lactose from your diet.  Sugars that are not picked up by you are picked up by your gut bacteria.  When they get a whole bunch of food this way they generally cause some issues, such as gas and dierehha.  If the symptoms are modest then likely there is no to little effect on protein absorbed as this primary happens at the beginning of the small intestine.  Switching to a more pure protein source is going to have an impact on quality of life more then anything.  You can also take lactaid, or any other otc that has lactase to help you break down the sugar."

nutrition,3coa47,welearntolive,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"I'm lactose intolerant too. Small amounts of lactose (less than a couple grams) shouldn't pose much of a problem for the body- so a scoop or two of whey concentrate might be okay, but definitely not more than a sip of milk. Whey isolate is your best bet and shouldn't make you sick at all.    I don't have much of a problem with a cup or so of 0-2% plain greek yogurt, since the probiotics in it help break down some of the lactose. Some cottage cheese brands have live cultures too, but most don't. For me the problem arises when I combine dairy products without realizing it (yogurt for breakfast, milk in my tea, cheese on a sandwich at lunch). My best advice for you is to try to consume only one or two servings a day of dairy, max.  There are lots of charts online with grams of lactose listed for various dairy product, like this one. If you're gunna have more than a couple grams of lactose in a day, that lactase pill is a good idea.    I'm not really qualified to answer the question of how it affects protein or nutrient absorption. But, from personal experience, when I feel crappy from too much lactose, my tummy issues make me not want to eat... and not eating definitely affects the gainz. So, biochemistry aside, you'll feel best and make the most progress if you remove lactose either through abstaining or through lactase."

I walk everywhere, I live on the seventh floor and almost always take the stairs up and down when I could take the elevator, idk I try to do little things since I'm not currently on a work out plan or anything.    But honestly, my tummy is rounder and fuller than yours was.  I feel like I always look three months pregnant and it was worse when I was heavier.  Its not a very big exaggeration to say all my fat is carried in my stomach (with some distributed on my back and etc).  I have a thigh and I can easily cross my legs twice, I carry no weight on the outsides of my legs or hips or whatever.  Maybe if I can work up the nerve I'll post pictures of myself for reference.

I lost 20 lbs, started lifting, and lost 5 more. So that's worth being aware of just in case that is your only concern. You can eat at maintenance and do a recomp, which involves gaining no weight at all, but will cut some body fat and add muscle in its place.  And yes, it definitely sounds like you are describing an apple shaped body type! (That doesn't mean, by the way, that this is not in your control-- it is. You can do it.) I would actually call myself more of a pear, especially now. There was only a brief little period (around when that picture was taken) when I was apple-y. I really just wanted to show the difference that a resistance training program can make, more than anything. A lot of people come to places like /r/loseit and the like and are near underweight but still want to lose weight because of tummy fat, when the real issue is that they have very little muscle. It is my opinion that you will have better results either getting on a real resistance-based exercise program and/or cutting a bit more weight than worrying about shit like gluten. Keep your diet healthy, eat your veggies, add in strength training, and don't get lost in random details, especially ones that are not well supported by the scientific literature.

You should be experimenting, then using the weight of the other ingredients to aim for a consistent 0.5% by weight, or whatever matches your target.   It also has to be well mixed with water, or it won't have the same effect each time. Here's a general discussion of this type of thickener.  Are you sure you want to flavor the protein powder?

nutrition,3cnfb2,FrigoCoder,2,Thu Jul 9 09:30:32 2015 UTC,"one more post for you...instead of focusing on ""stopping the bad habits"" why don't you come up with some new positive habits with food that will slowly push out the bad habits by default. For example, since I love delicious food, I've gotten into trying out new recipes I find online. Not health food recipes, but mexican food mostly because I happen to love it. So I started up a binder to put my favorite recipe print-outs. I would try out these new dinner recipes, and eventually they became part of my cooking repertoire, and I can do some of them without reading the recipe. Eventually I plugged in the entire recipes into my calorie counting app, then divided by the number of servings to get the calorie total for one serving, and wrote it on the recipe. Cooking homemade delicious food that I used to only get at restaurants has become a new hobby and skill I have. Perhaps you can do the same? Find recipes for the snacks and junk food you like, even. Sometimes making it at home has less calories because you can replace ingredients that are lower calorie. I usually have to cut the recipe in half though because they're trying to feed a family of 4.   Another thing you can do is write out a rough eating plan, of what times of day you'd like to spread out your food. For example I do Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner, Snack/Dessert. And I have a calorie range that I want to stick to for each of those eating times. Then you can figure out how many calories a day you should stay under, even just figuring out your maintenance level at first. Then spread out the calories in a way that works best according to your usual eating habits. For example, I like a bigger dinner and a decent sized snack after dinner, so I have a light breakfast/lunch/afternoon snack. Then you have a framework of how on track you are throughout the day, like ""this whole chocolate bar is going to eat up BOTH of my snacks if I eat it all right now, so I'll eat half now, and half after dinner"". You'll start to come up with a list of go-to foods for each of those meal times, that fit the calorie range, or you could even write out a list of foods you like for each category. Doing all this research and effort even one time helps set you up for better habits. Then you can rely more on ""the plan"" instead of trying to decide what to do each and every interaction with food you have. It takes out some of the guesswork, and removes some of your weaknesses with giving in to high calorie snacks. And you can revise ""THE PLAN"" as you move forward and figure things out about yourself.  I'm a big fan of writing things out. The best thing I ever did was one day I didn't place any limits on my expectations of myself: I wrote down my dream weight. Didn't matter that I thought I'd never in my life realistically reach that weight. Then I made a list with my starting weight and 5 lb increments lost. It might be a long list, doesn't matter. Then every increment I wrote down a reward I would give myself for reaching that weight. Pedicure, new shirt, massage, facial, tattoo, cosmetic procedure, whatever. And I set up a recurring transfer of money into a special savings account that I set up online JUST for my reward funds. Can't remember, maybe it was $20 every 2 weeks. I printed out my rewards/weight loss list and taped it to my desk. It motivated the shit out of me. But more importantly, it made me realize that why the hell can't I reach my dream weight? It's physically possible. Just remember that. Yeah, it might take 5 years, it might take 10 years, but it's possible. You have the rest of your life to work on it, might as well reach for the stars. Woohoo, I just pumped myself up! Gonna listen to Ellie Goulding ""Anything Could Happen"". Gonna print out my list again (this was originally over a year ago, I've stayed the same weight for a year (not for lack of trying, that's just how much I struggle with food!).

To be honest I could probably see a therapist about it since it's become so ingrained. I get strong impulses to eat (because it's instant gratification) and I am terrible at controlling my impulses.

But again, like we both have alluded to, it's easy to find yourself justifying a new bad act because you changed another behavior. That is where it's tricky. But anyway, I just thought it might help to look at it like minor victories. Take your five favorite bad things. For me it was beer, cheese, bread, lattes and energy drinks. I decided first I will stop the energy drinks. I went cold turkey on one thing. I controlled and changed a habit. It was easy because I still ate like shit.

That's just me though and again maybe this method is not for you.   I guess what I am ultimately trying to say is something like: whether you go cold turkey on everything, on one thing at a time, on nothing, it's up to you. You are not responsible for the things that happen to you, only the way you react to them. I don't mean to sound blunt, but you came to this sub looking for advice.

Everything from the pyramids to a child learning to tie shoes. You are the one who has to decide what you can do. You are gonna be uncomfortable and tested, especially at first, by all of the temptations that lead you to where you don't want to go. You can do it.  It is within possibility for you to become healthy, it is just a matter of you doing it. And for some reason I feel I need to tell you that an I believe you can. Not because you're special, but because you are capable of harnessing your mind to do great things. Who cares if you're 31 or 71. Time can mess with your head.

nutrition,3clc4w,gtk210,2,Wed Jul 8 21:33:16 2015 UTC,"Studies have shown if you feed someone a bunch of calories as fat, they gain fat (1). If adding fat to your diet makes you gain body fat without a major increase in how much fat you're burning, where else would the body fat have possibly come from? Furthermore, where would the extra fat you ate possibly go?  Unless butter is supposed to be uniquely non-fattening for whatever reason. In one study adding cheese, butter, and almonds to the diet caused a gain in body fat (2). Adding roughly the same amount of almonds in another study produced less gain (3) suggesting the cheese and butter helped produce the weight gain in the previous study.  Finally, dairy fat, like butter, contains some unique fatty acids (which are 15 and 17 carbons long). Studies have shown (4,5) that people who consume more dairy fat have greater amounts of these fatty acids in their body fat. If someone believes butter can't transform into body fat it would be fairly difficult for them to explain such an observation.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/62/1/19.full.pdf http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jc.2011-2314 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12074256 http://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/3/828 http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/68/2/291"

Even at the same caloric intake, the nut group would have gained less weight because in whole, raw (or to a lesser extent roasted) almonds, the fats and actually any other nutrient present is not fully broken down by chewing and later enzymatic digestion and bacterial fermentation, due to the complex fiborous matrix. This effect is actually widely documented and often referred to as ""dietary thermogenesis"", although this may not be a 100% correct wording in this context.

My point is that while this is interesting, it is not really helpful. For a couple of reasons.   Humans are not rats and we do not--nor does anyone want to--eat a diet of only medium chain fatty acids. It just isn't going to work. You may lose weight, but smoking and alcoholism are also both associated with weight loss. So it's not really helpful, because its not good for you (because off all the other things you'll be missing) and because its just not feasible. As Westerners, we're just too damn fat. And this isn't because we're not eating the wrong types of fats or the wrong ratios of macros. Its because we're just eating too damn much. If we can get that under control, then most all the problems will be solved. But humans have this thing where we wait for the ""perfect"" to take action while ignoring the simple and obvious which is already all around us. So we wait to learn about the ""perfect"" workout instead of just going for a walk. We wait to learn about the ""perfect"" diet instead of just eating less. Meanwhile, with all this waiting, we're just sitting here dying of complications of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.    So in my original comment I said, yes, I know of the nuances. I've read them too and they're pretty interesting. But, they don't really matter, because main issue is overconsumption, and we already know what to do about that.

nutrition,3cm9pe,XRMFit,2,Thu Jul 9 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"My question is: why do mono- and polyunsaturated fats reduce LDL levels if LDL's are necessary for moving cholesterol to cells?   You're confused because there isn't just one LDL.  There's a huge range of lipoprotein sizes ranging from chlymicrons to IDL to LDL to VLDL to HDL similar to how people range in size from morbidly obese adults to babies.  It's a spectrum.  LDL is typically classified into two groups (LDL-A and LDL-B), with LDL-A being larger and LDL-B being smaller, but the transition between the two is really more gradual.  LDL-A is raised by dietary fat (all fat) and contains more cholesterol.  Dietary carbs (sugar especially) raise LDL-B.  LDL-A is more atherogenic on a per particle basis, but carries more cholesterol, so you need less of them and thus having primarily LDL-A is a good thing.  Saturated fat (typically) stimulate LDL-A production much more than say monounsaturated fat, but that's not true for say stearic acid.  In other words, the combination of LDL-A and LDL-B contribute to the final LDL number (which is really just a measure of cholesterol and not LDL particles).  You're still getting cholesterol if you eat more nuts vs. say butter.  You'll only ever get ~30% of the cholesterol you make from your diet.  You can move that a few percent, but cholesterol is a really important molecule.   Why do LDL's penetrate artery walls but HDL's do not if HDL's are smaller?   They do if they're oxidized.  They're just cholesterol scavenging proteins and there are a lot less of them.  LDL proteins takes cholesterol (a sterol / steroid alcohol / solid alcohol) from the liver to cells, while HDL brings it from the cells back to the liver.  https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/2872/more-good-cholesterol-is-not-always-good-for-your-health.aspx  I recommend reading this...  http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/the-straight-dope-on-cholesterol-part-i  It's only ~10 parts"
nutrition,3cm9pe,billsil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:05:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I understand your first answer but am still left a little confused about the original question.  So there are many types of LDL, and mono- and poly-unsatured fat reduce LDL levels (is this true?), and that is considered a good thing because certain types of LDL are bad? Do they reduce total LDL or a specific kind?  As for the second question, I had learned that they were oxidized after they penetrated the artery wall because macrophages would then try to attack them. Do you mean they have the potential to be oxidized as they move through the bloodstream - without interacting with an artery wall at all? If so, why is that?  I don't want to be a pain and I really appreciate your reply haha I'll be reading those articles today. Thanks for linking them. If an answer to any of my latest questions are in there, please just say so :)"
nutrition,3cm9pe,billsil,2,Thu Jul 9 16:54:13 2015 UTC,"mono- and poly-unsatured fat reduce LDL levels (is this true?),   All fats reduce LDL-B and increase LDL-A.  Saturated fat increases LDL-A more.  One LDL-A contributes more to the total cholesterol number (it has more cholesterol than an LDL-A), but is still one particle, so it lowers your risk relative to 50 LDL-B's.  tldr: yes, but there's a lot more going on (e.g. saturated fat raises HDL).   and that is considered a good thing because certain types of LDL are bad   Yes that is the logic, which is not necessarily correct.  It's a tradeoff between LDL size and total cholesterol amount.  Cholesterol (enough anyways) is good for you as it help you repair damaged cells.  Too many particles is not.   As for the second question, I had learned that they were oxidized after they penetrated the artery wall because macrophages would then try to attack them.    The macrophages clean them up.  An oxidized particle (it's damaged) is attracted to the wall by a charge.  The wall and normal LDL is charged (I want to say negatively charged) to prevent particles from hitting it and causing damage (they repel each other), while a damaged LDL particle has the opposite charge, so it's attracted to the wall.  The macrophages are supposed to clean up a few LDL, but not a lot.  The LDL get oxidized when they don't have enough antioxidants (mainly Vitamin A & E) because you eat a lousy diet and/or sit around in the blood too long because you have too many particles and thus aren't getting used fast enough.  LDL is fine.  Oxidized LDL is not.  They oxidize due to oxygen in the artery.  Atherosclerosis/arterio-sclerosis doesn't happen in veins (again caveats with everything)."
nutrition,3cm9pe,billsil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that was really helpful. Just two more questions,  Without macrophages, do LDL's have another way of being 'cleaned up'? In other words, if macrophages only clean up a few, what happens to the rest?  And just to clarify all the points in both replies, both LDL and HDL can be oxidized, but it's less likely for HDL to be oxidized because there's less of them in the bloodstream? Am I understanding that right?  This has been massively helpful, thank you!"
nutrition,3cm9pe,billsil,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"Glad to help :)   Without macrophages, do LDL's have another way of being 'cleaned up'?   Not that I know of.   In other words, if macrophages only clean up a few, what happens to the rest?   They sit there and cholesterol binds to it creating a plaque, which is a good thing (it's preventing further damage).  If the plaque large, it'll harden (cholesterol is soft and waxy), and that can break off.  That's not good.   it's less likely for HDL to be oxidized because there's less of them in the bloodstream?   That's part of it.  The frequency of getting resupplied with antioxidants (specifically Vitamin A & E) when returning to the liver also matters a lot.  LDL carry cholesterol to cells and HDL returns it.  So if you have lots of lots of LDL particles, you need to return lots of cholesterol for it to get reprocessed.  An HDL will have say one trip to a cell and back to the liver before it gets resupplied.  If your LDL-B is high, the particles are small and you don't have many antioxidants onboard, and you'll have more trips before they're used (because too much cholesterol is being transported).  LDL-A are large and have more antioxidants, so they can handle more trips.    Also, the surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio matters a lot.  A larger LDL particle has a smaller SA/V ratio and thus has more antioxidants per oxidizable area.  Just keep your LDL-B low and you'll be a lot better off.  So ditch refined carbs and especially sugar if you haven't.  Eat lots of nutrient dense foods.  You can reverse heart disease, but you have to cut the junk and that doesn't mean cutting fat though you can do that too if you want.  Just eat whole foods, but meat & cheese are whole foods, and so are veggies.  Cake is not."

nutrition,3ckxw2,antegeia,2,Wed Jul 8 18:41:36 2015 UTC,"The lipid tails of fatty acids are often incompletely hydrogenated (unsaturated).   Removing a hydrogen molecule from a saturated fatty acid leaves an unsaturated double bond, which which in the usual biological case of cis double bonds means these lipid tails are kinked and can't pack tightly together, lowering their viscosity and melting point. Cold water fish have plenty of unsaturated fats that keep their cell membranes fluid and appropriately permeable at cold temperatures.   With hydrogenation, industrial food processors add hydrogen back to naturally unsaturated fats, to increase their melting point and make them more shelf stable.  With complete hydrogenation one gets a saturated fat, but the processors have usually aimed at partial hydrogenation. Partial hydrogenation reduces some cis-double bonds present in unsaturated fats, but it also converts some cis-bonds to trans-bonds, in which the lipid tail is stiff, but not kinked as in most natural unsaturated fats. Trans fats are the worst of all fats for blood cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes. Artificial trans fats have been banned in the U.S. food supply by the FDA, but about a third of trans fat in the diet occurs naturally in dairy and meat products."

No, at least not the green parts. That indicates the presence of natural toxic compounds called glycoalkaloids (GA), which are a plant's built-in protection against insects and disease. GA are always present in potatoes, triggering toxic effects in humans only if consumed in large amounts. Symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, even hallucinations. You can't destroy GA by cooking, but since they lie just under the skin, cutting away any green is enough to make potatoes safe to eat. Chips and fries, which are typically peeled before cooking, are usually low in GA. However, fried potato skins in restaurants can contain large amountsâup to seven times the safe limitâaccording to one report. ENs Bottom Line. Always cut away green spots to avoid consuming too much GA. If a potato has a lot of green, discard it. To be super safe, avoid potato skins.   Further reading:   Korpan YI et al. 2004.

Your body is very, very good at letting you know when you've had enough calories/nutrients/water/sleep/stress/etc. and trying to fight it is a losing battle.  If you don't get enough nutrients or sleep or have too much stress or don't eat enough fat/protein/carbohydrates (with caveats on carbs for sure), you will be hungrier/lethargic, such that you get enough fat/protein/carbs.

People look at the formula and arbitrarily assume the causality is from right to left, which implies obesity is caused by gluttony and sloth, which then implies the solution is to force yourself to eat less and force yourself to move more, regardless of what cues your body gives. It's essentially a very unhelpful explanation and a statement of consequence rather than treatment strategy.  If you read the opponent's comment carefully, he/she does not outright deny that if a system ends up taking in more than it consumes, it will gain weight. The opponent rather argues that there are factors that prevent people from consciously eating less and moving more.  As an example, there's this analogy in this thread by /u/stubble:     A simple accounting metaphor might work. How do you ensure your company makes a profit? Receivables > Payables How do you ensure your company loses money? Payables > Receivables. Pretty simple stuff really..   Building on that, the analogue to the eat less move more advice is like the CFO of that hypothetical company announcing the growth strategy for the year to be   ""success is easy, all you need to do is get more receivables and less payables!"",   and then citing physics and calling investors idiots if they start arguing that it's exceedingly difficult due to the financial, strategic, and economic environment the firm is in."

When people generally use the CICO argument, they say something like ""cut 500 calories a day, and you'll lose a pond in a week"". Or, conversely, ""add 20 calories a day, and you'll gain 20 pounds in a decade"".   These statements are laughably false, and we know this because even in well controlled studies of a group of people, if they cut 500 calories a day, their actual weight loss will be all over the map and over time, their weight loss will stop.   It doesn't include the effect the type of foods consumed (both macro- and micro-nutrient content) will have on hormone regulation and, therefore, drive to eat. It also doesn't say anything about the state of the dieter's body where, for example, insulin resistance may cause high serum insulin levels that keep fat locked in adipose tissue. Oh, and what about medications that interfere with those afore-mentioned hormones? Nope, no account. And, once all that isn't accounted for, the body goes and adjusted energy use as a function of energy consumption until you are trying to run 10k a day on half a banana.  I could go on and on.

If you have certain conditions, such as insulin resistance (which many people do considering nearly 35% of the US is pre-diabetic or worse), then using just CICO and reducing the amount of food you consume without changing the quality of it will make the task unnecessarily difficult and unsustainable."

For those people, ""eat less and move more"" is not just trite to the point of uselessness, it is actively damaging as their belief in their ability to effect a change dwindles and their REE reduces more and more, eventually catabolizing muscle to provide enough energy, making loss that much more difficult.   I've walked people through increasing calories while reducing exercise in order to get them losing weight again, something I've heard is impossible (literally, I've been told that), but what those calories are matters significantly. Tailoring the diet to the individual is necessary.  To be clear, if you are metabolically healthy (which generally means no more than 5-10% overweight with no other health problems), reducing calories and/or moving more seems to work fine (even if all those calories are Twinkies). It may not be optimal, but it works. When you pass that point, though, you have to approach things differently. I've yet to meet a person who was obese, lost the weight and kept it off for any length of time, even those who claim they did it exclusively by eating less and moving more, who did not change their diet significantly in the process.  (And my point about running 10k's on a banana was, indeed, reductio ad absurdum but, as you seem to imply by bringing it up, was not a logical fallacy.  Exaggeration for rhetorical effect, illustrating where particular lines of thinking can go, is useful for exploring ideas. It becomes a logical fallacy when it is used as proof of something, such as ""'Eat less and move more' is wrong because you will end up eating a banana and running a 10k to lose weight"".)"

In this context I take exception to characterizing a 1-3 % change with unusual intake of a caffeinated beverage as ""significant"" Perhaps we just have to agree to disagree. Thank You!"
nutrition,3cixab,yeahmaybe2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"Ah but significance is relative! I don't have numbers for urine output on hand but a ""significant"" increase in urine output with a caffeinated beverage vs water alone could very plausibly represent a single percentage change in total body water, given the massive amount of water in the body.   Edit: While there is variability in the evidence, (which, given the small sample sizes used in these studies, I would suggest could be attributed to individual differences in sensitivity to caffeine) there have been demonstrated effects for statistically significant acute diuresis vs. water with caffeine doses as low as 240 mg (Table 1; http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559762_2)"
nutrition,3cixab,HowAboutNitricOxide,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"In the NIH study the authors use the term ""...significant acute..."" Again I disagree with this use of the word in the given context.  Later, in the same study the same authors state ""...the relatively modest potency of caffeine to enhance water excretion...""  This gives the appearance that the authors are contradicting themselves.  Just because they are scientists does not make them linguists.  From the second medscape article: ""Indeed, the only investigations in Table 1 to observe chronic effects of caffeine consumption[3,12] found no indication of dehydration in numerous indices of hydration status. Thus, although some experiments reported that caffeine caused diuresis exceeding that of water, a) no evidence of chronic dehydration exists in the scientific literature, and b) restricting dietary intake of caffeine is not scientifically and physiologically supported.""  Emphasis - ""...restricting dietary intake of caffeine is not scientifically and physiologically supported.""  So, it appears that in an ""acute"" situation, caffeine has a modest to significant effect, at least according to these authors(who are not linguists). And that in a chronic situation caffeine has little to no effect.  So, there's the science, now for some deductive reasoning and empirical evidence.  It is my considered opinion that caffeine intake, even in acute situations is not a diuretic to be considered of any real significance.  It is my deductive reasoning that any hot liquid taken into the body in the first 1-2 hours after rising will appear to have a diuretic effect, due to the dearth of urination during sleep, the sudden intake of fluid, and the intake of hot liquid.  This ""theory"" of mine has been proven to my satisfaction by several single participant case studies.  I substituted warm water for my own coffee several different days and measured my urine output and compared that to at least 5 normal coffee days and found no real difference.  There were variations day to day, but no more than a 1-2 ounces in any situation.  Yes, I caught and measured my urine, just because I wanted to know.  As I said early on in this thread, I have been studying hydration for 20 years.  I am sufficiently convinced that caffeine is not a diuretic."
nutrition,3cixab,yeahmaybe2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:46:42 2015 UTC,"Bearing in mind that I'm not advocating for dietary restriction of caffeine, surely you can appreciate limitations of only testing yourself? It's wholly possible you're just not sensitive enough to caffeine for substantial diuresis to occur, especially considering you didn't indicate a washout period of zero caffeine intake to restore pharmacological naivete prior to your ""tests."" ;)  Edit: Whoops, I misinterpreted what you described. I misconstrued it as you measuring urine output in response to caffeine intake, whereas it was the opposite. In that case, with habitual caffeine intake and expected development of tolerance, caffeine would not be expected to exhibit an acute diuretic affect (which is necessarily considered vs. water alone), and so it follows that your results would be expected: water substituted for caffeinated liquid in a caffeine-tolerant individual should produce the same urine output as the caffeinated liquid. The question is of acute diuresis when caffeine is administered to caffeine-naive individuals.  In this regard, I feel that there is sufficient evidence to say that substantial (relative to normal dietary sources and servings) doses of caffeine have on average a modest to significant diuretic effect, and accounting for individual variability, this effect could be large in some individuals. Further, and this is news to me, caffeine can increase urinary urgency and frequency essentially independent of modifying urine production (see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036994/).  Edit 2: Also, see this recent meta-analysis kindly supplied by /u/Sanpaku: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154702. The weight of evidence is clearly for an existent, acute diuretic effect of caffeine, though not for any resulting dehydration, even during exercise. Note as well, that the diuresis the authors describe as ""minor"" in the abstract is stated to correspond to an average of ~110 milliliters of increased urine output. (1) That's a lot of urethral throughput! (2) Combined with increased urinary urgency and frequency, you can imagine why occasional caffeine users falling in the upper half of the bell curve experience quite convincing symptoms!  Anyway, the discussion has been stimulating and I appreciate the chance for our dialogue. Cheers!"

Several doctors have told me as long as I keep peeing and I don't consume more ounces then my body can handle at a time I am fine.

You can use evolutionary arguments to say that most populations throughout history have had some degree of dependence some type of animal product, but that isn't proof in itself.  One thing I can confidently say is that there is also no definitive evidence that a vegan diet is the healthiest one, despite what vegans will tell you. The vegan diet is based more on morality rather than hard science.  To further complicate things, a lot of how diets interact with people comes down to individual variance, so you would ultimately have to self-experiment to know for sure.   The burning question is do you have an ongoing moral opposition to eating non-veg? If not, you should slowly introduce non-veg back into your diet and see how you do."

I'm 2 years older than you, not had meat or fish in nearly 20 years and have had some problems as well. (Uninformed parents just decided not to give me meat and that was that) Eating meat won't do much if you're tired because your vitamin D is low for example. A combination of high D and B12 supplementation gave me more energy, but I started taking them after I studied my blood test and came to the conclusion that although my doctor said they were okay, they were still very low. I feel better on a high dose of those two even though my levels were considered within normal range.  I do think you can be healthy on a vegetarian diet. It may not work for everyone, but for a lot of people it does seem to work. It's just a matter of being informed I guess. I'd say have your blood checked and have a look at your deficiencies and things that are considered healthy but are still low. You may just need slightly higher levels of something to feel good. We all have different needs so it is possible. Either eat more food with what you're missing or supplement if it's something like iron or B12. Some people say that vegetarians can get everything from food but personally I find it quite hard. (Really small, I'm only allowed to eat 1400cal or so which makes it harder) Nothing wrong with a supplement if needed. Also check things like protein if you haven't done it yet. I had a hard time getting enough protein on most days so I have a shake now. It could be something unexpected. I had no idea.  I take Cod Liver Oil which obviously has omega3. I've not noticed any benefits (doesn't mean there are none of course, it could be helping me without me knowing about it) but it's just something they used to give me as a kid and I figured why not. (I know it's fish. Cod Liver Oil is the only exception I make)  No need to eat meat just yet. Figure out what could be causing it first. There's usually a solution that doesn't involve eating animals.  Edit: things that are harder to get in a vegetarian diet: iron and B12. Deficiencies can go hand in hand though, so don't just test those two. Sometimes protein as well, depending on what you eat. (Happens more when you're vegan though. But it is possible.)"

I would recommend that you add small amounts to your food throughout the day so it doesn't feel like you are eating too much. You should be aiming to add about 250-500Cals/day which in theory is about .5-1lbs/week.

It sounds to me that what you are looking for is a Protein Sparing Modified Fast.  Although this should be done under a doctor's supervision, you ensure adequate protein intake and then supplement with the required miscro-nutrients so that your body doesn't consume your muscles for nutrients.

Carbohydrates (sugars) are the only thing your red blood cells and mostly your brain cells can consume for energy. When you starve yourself of them, your brain cells can use ketones for energy via a different pathway (from breakdown of fat), but there will be side effects of starvation (tired, disoriented, etc). The only vitamins your fat holds on to are fat-soluble: A, D, E, and K. The rest of them, all the 8 B-vitamins, and C, are water-soluble and are not held on to in your body and hence are needed on a daily basis. Without these vitamins, you will begin to experience cheilosis, scurvey, poor wound healing, overall weakness/tiredness, easy bruising, and others. Many people die from a month without food. It depends on how large your fat reserves are. As your micronutrients are used and recycled by your body, some will be excreted, and you will need to consume more. There is a famous hospital lawsuit where a team forgot to give a tube-fed patient micronutrients for a month and he suffered permanent brain damage and was never the same. Be careful."

Taking multivitamins is completely unnecessary if you can otherwise get them from eating food. Only people with deficiencies or certain disorders actually have an actual need to take multivitamins. You cannot absorb vitamins as well in multivitamin form as when you eat food that contains them.
nutrition,3cf9g0,britrochtay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:13:28 2015 UTC,But you can take a multivitamin on an empty stomach (assuming that you drink water with it) because the water soluble vitamins would be dissolved in the water and the fat soluble vitamins would be dissolved in the fat?
nutrition,3cf9g0,britrochtay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"A multi isn't the best thing to do. Combinations of certain vitamins can prevent absorption so you don't actually know which vitamins your body gets enough of and which vitamins you aren't absorbing at all. If you really don't get anything but water you need to think this trough and figure out how to take your vitamins and which ones to combine. Some multi's are balanced out a bit more than others, but I'd look into it if I were you."

The current recommendation is not rooted in solid science however, so I disagree that we should use that as our default. I think during a large part of our history it would have been hard for many populations to average 130 net carbs every day.

nutrition,3cd0v7,AlwaysAbibliphobia,4,Tue Jul 7 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem up until about 6 months ago. I don't have my starting numbers handy but one I remember was my Triglycerides (~353).  My last reading was around 70. What I did about it was to read a whole lot and learn what I could because I wanted to get off statins. Had been on them for years and the doctor scared the mess out of me by mentioning diabetes was a serious risk for me. .  I will summarize what I learned.  Eat real food and exercise.  For the most part I don't eat it unless I make it.  In the grocery store stay off the isles and buy fresh meat, fruits and vegetables.  Also cut the soda and added sugars.  I agree with the other posters.  If all your doc is focusing on is total Cholesterol you might want to find another.  There is a ton of literature out there explaining how LDL and triglycerides are what you need to worry about.  They also point out that dietary cholesterol isn't what causes them to go up but rather a bad diet and lack of exercise.  In fact it is very likely going to be removed from the US nutrient of concern list later this year. ( http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/06-chapter-1/d1-2.asp)  Also here's one thing to think about in regards to the ""Family history"" theory.  I no longer think it is necessarily genetic but rather learned in most cases.  We learn how to eat from our family and if they eat poorly then we will too.  Thus the metabolic syndrome kicks in.  High Cholesterol is just one part of it. Diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are among the others.   That being said there are those that truly have physiological issues that cause these problems.  However, I urge you to try everything you can to be sure you aren't one before taking statins.  Good luck with your journey my friend.  If I can do it anyone can."
nutrition,3cd0v7,georgeb2002,2,Tue Jul 7 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"Hi! Nurse here. I'm just going to tell you what we tell people in the hospital. Weight loss is very important. Heart health in general is improved by weight loss which is what we are really worried about here. Cardiovascular exercise, which you already understand is important is also key. As far as diet, there is very little conclusive evidence on anything lowering cholesterol besides weight loss exercise and INCREASING FIBER. The reason fiber helps reduce cholesterol levels is simple. Cholesterol is excreted into the GI tract in the form of Bile. In order to conserve cholesterol your body reabsorbs this bile. Bile however loves to bind with fiber, which cannot be absorbed into the blood stream. If you eat a high fiber diet, you are increasing your body's ability to excrete cholesterol naturally through the GI tract. Good sources of fiber? Vegetables, Fruit, Beans, whole grains, fiber enriched foods, fiber supplements (such as psyllium husk),etc. Things that are low in fiber: Meat, eggs, fish, butter, ice cream, refined carbohydrates, white bread, sweets, pizza, macaroni and cheese, cheese, etc.   So lots of people on here are giving really good advice, but the root of reducing cholesterol is weight loss, cardio, and fiber. All of these things improve your health in many other ways as well so you will feel the difference in many aspects of your life."
nutrition,3cd0v7,Pterasaur,2,Tue Jul 7 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"Fiber is something that I have never really looked at. I've heard that eating lots of fiber will keep me feeling more ""full"". Will those fiber drinks be adequate? Or would I have to get it from food sources?"
nutrition,3cd0v7,Pterasaur,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:23:33 2015 UTC,"Other food sources like vegetables have added benefits like lower caloric density than fiber supplements and higher micronutrient content. The liquid fiber supplements might not keep you feeling full as long, but it will prevent you from re-absorbing biliary cholesterol in exactly the same way. Most people end up using a mix of increasing vegetable consumption and taking fiber supplements. Honestly eating enough veggies alone to get the full 15-30 grams of fiber recommended is pretty hard for most people.  There are some pretty great products that are essentially refined carbohydrates with fiber supplements mixed in, fiber one, barilla white fiber, there are also a couple brands of sandwich bread that fit that bill. They will keep you full longer like vegetables, legumes, and fruit, albeit without the micronutrient content. It can be easier to use these foods as replacements for your usual refined grains while you are making a transition to a healthier diet. Many people find giving up their favorite foods all at once is unsustainable, so these things can help.   fiber one does tend to use a lot of sugar-alcohols to sweeten products without adding calories, these sweeteners cause some people serious gas and diarrhea issues. Just as a forewarning."
nutrition,3cd0v7,FrigoCoder,5,Wed Jul 8 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"Don't focus on saturated fat, because it leads to bad decisions like cheerios, rice crackers, and pretzels. If you restrict saturated fat, your calories have to come from somewhere else, and I doubt you choose more expensive alternatives such as protein, monounsaturated fats, or omega 3 polyunsaturated fats as replacement. Cheaper alternatives such as sugar, refined carbohydrates, and hydrogenated oils play a much larger role in heart disease than saturated fat.  Just avoid sugar, sugary drinks, sugary food, refined carbohydrates, grain products, potatoes, hydrogenated vegetable oils, omega-6 rich vegetable oils, nutritionally void fruits like apples and oranges. Try to keep your net carbohydrate intake below 120 grams.  Eat vegetables, nutrient dense fruits such as berries, and fish. You can continue eating meat, eggs, and cheese, they have little to do with heart disease.  If you are really paranoid, you can balance your fat intake with monounsaturated fats from avocados and olive oil, omega 3 fats from fish or supplements, and omega 6 fats from nuts.  Do both strength exercise and cardio. Look up StrongLifts 5x5 and Couch to 5k, they are excellent programs for beginners.

What you meed to know is your triglycerides, LDL particle count (particularly how much is pattern B), and HDL. The ratios of those 3 pieces are what will mostly determine your risk level.  Based on that you can target it via diet. If your HDL is low, LDL particle count high, and triglycerides high, I would start with reducing sugar and refined carbohydrate in my diet (cherios, crackers, etc...). After a month or two I would get remeasured and then start playing with the types of fats I eat.  Exercise is obviously key and it undoes some of the damage bad food does."

Focusing on just the total cholesterol numbers and ratios of LDL, HDL etc. is dated. Are you overweight ? Did they also do a fasting glucose, 2 hour glucose and an HA1c? How about a CRP to look at inflammation? Again, just looking at those cholesterol numbers tells you very little about your health."

Actually seeing how bad foods are for you will help you make the changes you need. I dropped a hundred points of my bad cholesterol by simply following the app. I also lost twenty pounds. Cardio is good as is some weight training. But a diet change really yields the most benefits. Most research I have seen and trainers I have talked to tell me it's more about what you eat versus how much you work out. Also remember don't eat empty carbs. They make your fat go up. For example anything with diet in the label is bad. Even though it says it has no calories it still adds to weight gain. As others have said whole food diets are the best.

My doctor said, the range he typically looks at is between 1-200, anyone at 150-160 he worries about, because over time the cholesterol can build up and contribute to a heart attack. I'm currently at 260.   That's sort of true, but drastically oversimplified.  The problem isn't ""clogged"" arteries, it's hard plaques.  Hard plaques are likely to break off and get lodged somewhere.     Coronary Artery Disease as Clogged Pipes  A Misconceptual Model  Misconception Number 1: Arterial Narrowing Is the Problem  Misconception Number 2: Fat Clogs Arteries  More recent observational studies do not support the use of low-fat diets.  More recently, the AHA recommended that people limit their intake of sugar, which now appears to contribute to obesity, hypertension, and subsequently coronary heart disease.20 However, patients and many doctors have not gotten this message. The AHAâs heart-healthy label still appears on a number of low-fat, high-sugar foods, including fruit juices and sugary cereals,21 whereas patients continue to believe that dietary fat, especially the saturated fat found in cheese and bacon, is the cause of heart disease.   http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/6/1/129.full  When the arterial wall is damaged (e.g. from high blood glucose, a diet lacking in non-starchy veggies), the wall becomes charged.  This charge draws LDL into the wall in order to repair the wall.  Once bound to the wall, if the cholesterol becomes oxidized due to further damage, the cholesterol does not function properly leading to even more cholesterol being driven into the wall.    This is an inflammatory process that is necessary to help repair your cells.  Furthermore, inflammation begets inflammation.  All sorts of other cells (e.g. macrophages that come in and destroy damaged cells), effectively creating a traffic jam causing more oxidation.   Cholesterol can be obtained from the diet or it can be synthesized de novo. An adult on a low-cholesterol diet typically synthesizes about 800 mg of cholesterol per day.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22336/  You can make 3x what you can eat (300 mg was the old/now gone recommendation).  The issue is how much you make/how much you need to heal your body.  Furthermore the big scary LDL number doesn't take into account the actual number of particles you have.  If you have lots of small particle (LDL-B; raised by carbohydrates; especially refined ones) vs. large particles (LDL-A; raised by dietary fat), but the same total LDL, you're at greater risk if they're small (more cars on the road vs. more buses for the same total number of passengers will cause more traffic).  If you measure LDL, you're measuring the total amount of cholesterol, not the number of particles.  If you have mainly LDL-B instead of LDL-A, then you're triglycerides and fasting blood glucose (all raised by dietary carbs; refined ones especially) will be high and you really need to clean up your diet, but cutting out fat isn't the way to do it."
nutrition,3cd0v7,jiggynutt,7,Tue Jul 7 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"Fun facts about cholesterol:  1)- Your liver produces 75-80% and the rest comes from the food you eat. If you eat less, the body increase its internal production. If you eat more, the body decreases it and lower its absorption from food. Because of this, dietary restrictions doesn't lower your cholesterol levels in a significant way. To see how tightly the body regulates it, here is the case of a man that ate 25 eggs each day for 15+ years and had normal cholesterol levels and was in health:  Normal Plasma Cholesterol in an 88-Year-Old Man Who Eats 25 Eggs a Day â Mechanisms of Adaptation  2)-Cholesterol values like many other biological parameters tend to follow an U shape(middle better) not a linear one(the lower is better) extremes are bad. People with low cholesterol levels tend to die more of infections and cancer. Violent and suicide behavior is related to low level of cholesterol. People tend to live the longest with cholesterol levels between 200-240 mg/dl:  Total cholesterol levels vs mortality in 164 countries  Is the use of cholesterol in mortality risk algorithms in clinical guidelines valid? Ten years prospective data from the Norwegian HUNT 2 study.  3)-50 % of the people who are hospitalized with heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels.   4)-Cholesterol is vital for life. Cholesterol is the raw material of many protective hormones(testosterone, progesterone,etc), vitamin D and bile salts that are use to digest fats. It is also part of the cellular membrane. 20% of all the cholesterol in your body is in the brain.  5)-High cholesterol levels can be an indicative of thyroid problems.The thyroid converts the cholesterol into hormones. These hormones protect you from stress. People under stressful conditions tend to have higher level of cholesterol that return to lower levels once the stressful situation ends.  Effects of Periodic Mental Stress on Serum Cholesterol Levels   Now you understand cholesterol better, so breathe, things are not as bad as you think :) . Every case is different but if I had ""high"" cholesterol levels I will do this:  a)-Eat 3-5 times per week a grated raw carrot salad with foods.  The fiber on it binds endotoxins produced from the bacteria in your intestines. This help the liver to do its job better. The liver is responsible for the production of the active thyroid hormone. In one study people had 11% lower cholesterol levels after including raw carrots in their diets for a few weeks:  The effect of raw carrot on serum lipids and colon function.  b)- Stopping eating cholesterol doesn't make a significant change in your blood levels. Don't avoid cholesterol rich food that are very nutritious...like liver, eggs, oysters, organ meats and so on. Avoid sources of oxidized(damage) cholesterol like powder milk and most vegetable oils.  C)-Prefer minimally processed food. Avoid canned and package food when possible.   d)-Include more fruits(papaya, cantaloupe, pineapple, guava, orange,etc) and vegetables(spinach, broccoli, kale, sauerkraut) in your diet. They have a great mineral/vitamin ratio in comparison to grains and cereals. Root tubers(ex:potato) are also  great.  e)-Find a way to manage your stress better. Meditation is a good tool but having positive relationships is better.  f)-If you smoke...stop. Smoking increase your risk of suffering a heart disease greatly(6 times in relation to a non-smoker). Quitting literary adds years to your life. I will worry about this more than food first."

Dietary cholesterol and saturated fat DO raise cholesterol level, mainly LDL and apo-B, which are the most atherogenic particules.  One very effective way that has been studied to lower plasma cholesterol is to go on a strict low-fat, plant diet.   See this study, for example   Rapid reduction of serum cholesterol and blood pressure by a twelve-day, very low fat, strictly vegetarian diet.   During this short time period, cardiac risk factors improved: there was an average reduction of total serum cholesterol of 11% (p < 0.001)   11% decreased in 12 days! A plant diet is very powerful against cardiovascular disease. Vegan, as a general rule, always have very low cholesterol level and low cardiovascular disease incidences. If you are serious about your condition, this is your best option.   The above poster also does not seem to understand the difference between whole and refined carbs, and lumps all carb togheter as being bad. Oat, for example, in its unrefined form, is well known for its cholesterol lowering effect.   Please consult a professionnal before undertaking such a diet, as some planning and supplementation is necessary for it to be optimal. Good luck."

If you've got super high cholesterol it's not a time to screw around with fad diets.   Bacon, eggs, butter, avocados, coconut oil are all your friends. If you can cut carbs down to 20-50 grams a day, your body will start using fat for energy rather than glucose.   That's some batshit insane advice. The only diet which is clinically proven to reverse heart disease is a whole food plant-based diet. Check out Dr Esselstyn's book ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"". The paleo/primal/Atkins diet has never been clinically proven to prevent and reverse heart disease.  Basically you want to cut overt fats and oils right out of your diet and focus on whole plant foods. You mentioned you like brown rice and broccoli, that's awesome, skip the chicken and add any other vegetables you like. Fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes. Get rid of the animal products, that shit is high in saturated fat and cholesterol.  Don't believe me? I had my blood work done a couple of weeks ago: my total cholesterol is 96 mg/dl and my LDL and HDL are both 42 mg/dl. You stick to the plant foods and you're going to get the results."
nutrition,3cd0v7,FINDTHESUN,3,Tue Jul 7 06:31:23 2015 UTC,"But unfortunately, a total cholesterol number tells you very little about your health. A low TC, especially in elderly, is associated with dementia, infection and cancer. Your body and brain needs good fats and cholesterol. And you don't want a low HDL.   If Esselstyn's book references Ornish's study, then you're talking about a small study (23 people) full of confounders. Was improvement seen because of a vegetarian diet or was it due to a combination of diet, smoking cessation, exercise and meditation/stress reduction therapy? When Ornish tried to repeat his study with a larger group and isolating for diet alone, he didn't get similar results.   Whole plant foods is a great foundation for a healthy diet, but going out of your way to avoid high quality fats isn't a good LONGTERM strategy. In the short term, especially if someone was eating a standard American diet of refined carbs and trans fats, vegetarian diets can improve bio markers, but so does eating a balanced diet of whole plants along with good fats and protein from animal sources. And vegetarians do get heart attacks and cancer. If you've been vegetarian for a long time and consuming low quality vegetable based oils which are inflammatory,  you might want to get a homocysteine and C reactive protein level to check for inflammation, which would tell you a lot more about your health than total cholesterol."

nutrition,3cdy0q,blahable,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:06:01 2015 UTC,"You're mixing up a few things here.    What is a myth is the idea that someone has to eat multiple complementary incomplete protein sources at the same meal or even on the same day in order to form a 'complete' protein from those individual incomplete protein sources.  This is generally considered to be false.  As long as the day-to-day running total has the correct ratio of amino acids and adequate total protein intake, then it doesn't really mater when you eat each incomplete protein source.  For example, you don't have to eat beans with rice (the most popular complementary combination) at the same meal, instead you could have a large serving of beans for breakfast and a large serving of rice for dinner and the net effect is basically the same.  However, that said, there absolutely are 'incomplete' or, more accurately, low-quality protein sources. Just having all the essential amino acids isn't enough for a food source to be considered a high-quality protein source.  For example, rice contains at least trace amounts of all the essential amino acids, BUT the ratio of those amino acids does not support maximum protein synthesis, so this food would be considered low-quality.  Now you can get around this even with a singular low-quality protein source by just eating more of that food until the intake of the rate limiting amino acid is sufficiently high enough, but in order to do this you'd have to eat more total protein from that food source (usually 2-3 times more total protein)."

nutrition,3cdy0q,autowikibot,2,Tue Jul 7 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"Diet for a Small Planet:       Diet for a Small Planet is a 1971 bestselling book by Frances Moore LappÃ©, the first major book to note the environmental impact of meat production as wasteful and a contributor to global food scarcity. She argued for environmental vegetarianism, which means choosing what is best for the earth and our bodies â a daily action that reminds us of our power to create a saner world.  The book has sold over three million copies and was groundbreaking for arguing that world hunger is not caused by a lack of food but by ineffective food policy. In addition to information on meat production and its impact on hunger, the book features simple rules for a healthy diet and hundreds of meat-free recipes. ""Its mix of recipes and analysis typified radicals' faith in the ability to combine personal therapy with political activism.""   Knowing that her audience would be skeptical that a vegetarian diet could supply sufficient protein, much of the book is devoted to introducing the method of protein combining. With this method of eating, different plant foods are taken together so that their combined amino acid pattern matches that of animal foods.  In some traditional cuisines there is a balance of 70% whole grains to 30% legumes, which may vary to 80% grains with 20% legumes. This tradition can be seen expressed in three regions:    Latin America: beans with tortillas or rice, Middle East: bulgar wheat with chickpeas, or pita falafel with hummus, Asia: soy with rice(southern China, northern Japan, Indonesia), soy with wheat or millet (northern China), or soy with barley (Korea and southern China).   LappÃ© admitted in the 10th anniversary 1981 version of the book that sufficient protein was easier to get than she had thought at first:   ""In 1971 I stressed protein complementarity because I assumed that the only way to get enough protein ... was to create a protein as usable by the body as animal protein. In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high-quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought.  ""With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on fruit or on some tubers, such as sweet potatoes or cassava, or on junk food (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories, they are virtually certain of getting enough protein.""    But while LappÃ© was correct that combining would indeed result in a more meat-like protein profile, some nutritionists have said that it is unnecessary: Individual plant foods contain all the amino acids required by humans, in amounts which satisfy growth and maintenance.  However, certain deficiencies of particular amino acids should be considered since such deficiencies can have a negative effect on health.   The first edition, published by Ballantine, was sponsored by the Friends of the Earth organization. It includes recipes based on the complementary combinations and was followed by a collection, Recipes for a Small Planet by Ellen Buchman Ewald, with an introduction written by LappÃ©. A film carrying LappÃ©'s message was distributed by Bullfrog Films.   In 1975, Frances Moore LappÃ© and Joseph Collins launched the California-based Institute for Food and Development Policy (Food First) to educate Americans about the causes of world hunger. In 2006, Frances' daughter, Anna LappÃ©, took Small Planet a step further with her book, Diet for a Hot Planet: The Climate Crisis at the End of Your Fork and What You Can Do About It (ISBN 978-1596916593). She revealed the disturbing connection between food production and climate change and outlined how we can eat food thatâs better for people and the planet.

nutrition,3caip1,longwinters,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:10:48 2015 UTC,"Basically, your adrenal glands react in times of stress, making lots of adrenaline  and noradrenaline but also making cortisol to help the body deal with stressful conditions. Hormones are a delicate balance, and when there is an excess of cortisol there is a decreased conversion of the thyroid hormones t4 (less active) to t3 (5x more active at regulating body's metabolism) meaning the hormones that are present are less effective. Higher levels of t4 in the bloodstream prevent the release of thyroid stimulating hormone, leading to lower production of hormones by the thyroid. Plus, your adrenals and your thyroid work together, if one is stressed the other is as well.   You can reduce your intake of xenoestrogens  or false estrogens such as bpas which can block thyroid hormone receptors. The most important thing is to reduce stress as much as possible- exercise, sleep well, meditate, whatever. I like lemon balm for relaxation but different things work for different people."

Coffee shouldn't have much impact on your hunger (other than the liquid content physically filling your stomach). Then again, everyone's body is different and a small percentage of the population has atypical responses to caffeine, for example it makes some people sleepy. If you think it makes you feel hungry, maybe just skip it or drink tea or water instead.

What you're probably feeling has less to do with the fiber content and more to do with the highly fermentable carbohydrates that are unique to specific vegetables, which can/will cause gas, bloating, and other TMI problems when you aren't used to eating them.  The heavy hitters here will be things like garlic, onions, leeks, broccoli, cabbage, chicory root, cauliflower, all legumes (especially red kidney beans), dandelions (all parts), mushrooms, and asparagus.  The least problematic vegetables would be things like squash, zucchini, cucumber, potatoes, tomatoes, green beans, and most leafy greens (think spinach, kale, chard, collards, etc., but NOT mustard greens or dandelion greens).  It's probably a good idea to limit the vegetables in the first list and slowly increase your intake of these over time.  The microbes in your gut will adapt to these foods (if you consume them) and eventually most people will stop having issues with them even when consumed in massive quantities."

Not to mention the fact that what goes on when you eat food cannot be explained purely by knowing the components of the food you're eating. In other words, eating cannot be reduced to the sum of its parts. Secondary and parallel reactions change the net effect of the food you eat.   For example, a multi vitamin that contains iron and calcium will almost completely inhibit iron absorption. However, eating a kale-spinach salad (which has both calcium and iron) will not completely inhibit iron absorption because of the vitamin C levels, as well as the oxalates which bind calcium, increasing iron absorption.

Thinking all protein is the same is like saying carbs, fat, and protein are the same because they all have calories.  It's an overly simplistic version of biology.  Even something like ""saturated fat raises your cholesterol"", which has been beaten into us and is generally true, but doesn't apply to stearic acid, which is a very common saturated fat.  Fiber is a carbohydrate (4 calories/gram is typical for carbs) and some of it can be fermented by bacteria in your gut to produce short chain saturated fatty acids, which are good for you.

nutrition,3c6sk6,DeMax96,12,Sun Jul 5 11:29:25 2015 UTC,"When you're sleeping and not digesting and are most at rest, your body burns calories at your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).    When you do that for 8 hours and spend the other 16 hours sedentary - sitting up, talking, lightly socializing/working from a chair, that is a Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) of approximately BMR+25%.    You will hear these terms BMR and TDEE a lot when considering how to control your calories and lose weight.    Eating your BMR in calories is advice that is popular.  It means you're eating at least 25% less than your body will burn, which makes your body burn its energy stores -- mostly fat.  It is sufficient for definite weight loss without an extremely challenging cut in your calories.  Another popular recommendation is to eat your TDEE minus 500 to 1000 calories a day.  For most people, this advice will have them eating less than their BMR and roughly translates to 1 to 2 pounds per week of weight loss.  For some people, it takes them lower than 1200/1500 calories which is the minimum women/men should regularly eat unless they're under the watchful eye of a professional.  80% of TDEE is a third popular choice, which happens to result back to the BMR.   All three are simply methods to determine a safe and sustainable calorie goal.    They are not about choosing an amount to support basic functions -- your body can go to its reserves -- burn fat -- to support those.     in order to not slow down my metabolism and then the amount of fat that I need to exercise would be burnt.   Anytime you burn less than your TDEE, your metabolism will adapt slightly lower.  The greater your deficit, the deeper is the adaptation.  This includes eating at your BMR calories, but since that is the milder of the deficit choices, it will be the milder adaptation.  The metabolic adaptation simply means that your body burns calories slightly slower than the formulas/calculators suggest that it should.  It's not permanent, it's not severe, and it doesn't go upside down (in my experience -- it doesn't go upside down all or, if it does, not long enough to matter).  Some dieters take a break after a few months as described in this article: http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-full-diet-break.html/ and some dieters never take a break and do not experience any long-term problems taking and keeping the weight off.  If you add exercise, your TDEE is higher and, unless you eat more, your deficit is deeper and your adaptation may deepen.  If you exercise and eat more to compensate, your adaptation may not happen, but now you are relying on that extra exercise which may not be sustainable when your weight loss is done -- also not desirable.  Anyway, fighting this adaptation is a really minor thing.  If it happened to me at all, it didn't last more than a couple of weeks.  I'm a good record-keeper and I am just not sure it even happened to me.   then how does the body know whether you make sport or have to have your basic bodily functions supplied?   It doesn't know.  Work, play, sleep -- it's all the same.   that the body mustn't use body fat for basic functions, in what case is metabolism slowed down   It's confusing you.  The advice to eat at your BMR has nothing to do with your basic functions, it's just a safe and calculable number.  If your dietitian or doctor or fitness coach were choosing the calorie goal for you, they might not tell you that it was your BMR or TDEE-500 -- they might just give you a number without an explanation.

nutrition,3c6sk6,Ifuqinhateit,2,Sun Jul 5 11:48:38 2015 UTC,"Alright so it really just depends on how many calories per day not which energy source (food, fat) the body uses to supply the brain, etc., right?"
nutrition,3c6sk6,Ifuqinhateit,3,Sun Jul 5 11:58:20 2015 UTC,"Correct. When going into severe caloric deficit, it is important to get enough protein and fat in your diet. If you are trying to lose weight, more than 750 calorie deficit per day will see big results in the short term, but will cause you to be sluggish as your glycogen and water stores will be depleted. It's hard to get proper nutrition on a <1,200 calorie per day diet."
nutrition,3c6sk6,SashimiJones,2,Sun Jul 5 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"The other commenter is incorrect. It's fine to eat below your BMR as long as you have sufficient fat reserves to make up the difference, which almost everybody does. Metabolism doesn't change appreciably when you're undereating just a little. It can happen if you have no spare body fat and still undereat, but that's probably not your situation. You're absolutely right that your body doesn't really know the difference between energy used to run itself and energy used for exercise, and you will lose weight regardless of the exercise you're doing or not doing as long as you're at a deficit.  That said, unless you're extremely overweight you shouldn't be eating at a deficit greater than 1000 calories under your TDEE. If you're trying to strength train, limit it to 500 under so you have enough fuel to build muscle.  Additionally, you should eat at least 1000 calories per day to make it easier for your body to perform its basic functions. Most of your body needs fats and proteins and your brain needs a little sugar.  tl;dr, shoot for 1000 under TDEE, 500 if you're also strength training. It's safe to eat under BMR as long as you're hitting 1000kcal/day. You will lose weight at a deficit."
nutrition,3c6sk6,mvpetri,2,Sun Jul 5 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"That said, unless you're extremely overweight you shouldn't be eating at a deficit greater than 1000 calories under your TDEE. If you're trying to strength train, limit it to 500 under so you have enough fuel to build muscle.   Energy is not the only factor for muscle building. Muscles cells have a high concentration of protein. Proteins are made of amino-acids, which contains nitrogen.  Fat does not contain nitrogen. So you can't build muscle over fat burning. You need to eat enough protein so your body can break them and use to synthesize your own."
nutrition,3c6sk6,crab_shak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"Something the other commentors have ignored is your desire to ""avoid the yoyo effect"". The classic approach which is all about running a caloric deficit assumes your body is naturally incapable of regulating its energy intake and expenditure, so you must intentionally starve yourself to lose weight. Starving is unsustainable and so by definition will cause the yoyo pattern that nearly all diets always produce.  You need to find a dietary pattern that is permanent and that happens to create a caloric deficit. If done correctly, the reduction in BMR is less severe and you will not need to starve. Your body will be able to properly access its fat stores and your hunger will remain in check. Only then is it a sustainable long-term eating pattern that will keep your weight stable perpetually.   The reason peoples' BMR tanks so hard sometimes is because they ignore the importance of food quality and focus on just counting calories. Any amount of nutrientless calories that are consumed (processed foods - flour included, sugar-sweetened beverages, etc...) is a self-inflicted handicap in that it will make running a deficit that much more difficult and intentional."

Below are some explanations from the 2007 American Institute of Cancer Research / World Cancer Research Fund - Second Expert Report  Introduction in the 2007 Report by the AICR/WCRF   MatÃ©, a herbal infusion, as drunk traditionally in parts of Latin America, is probably a cause of oesophageal cancer. Damage caused by the very high temperature of the drink, rather than by the herb itself, is judged to be responsible. There is limited evidence suggesting that matÃ© is a cause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, for the same reason. There is also limited evidence suggesting that high-temperature drinks are a cause of oesophageal cancer.   Conclusion Statement in the 2007 report by the AICR-WCRF   The evidence, from case-control studies, is consistent and a dose-response relationship is apparent. There is robust evidence for plausible mechanisms. Regular consumption of matÃ©, as drunk in the traditional style in South America, is a probable cause of oesophageal cancer.   General Mechanisms outlined by the AICR/WCRF   MatÃ© is typically drunk scalding hot through a metal straw. This produces heat damage in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus. Repeated damage of this nature can lead to cancer (also see Chapter 2). Chemical carcinogenesis from constituents of matÃ© has also been postulated.   Unfortunately, the Continuous Update Project (CUP) of the AICR/WCRF report, has a review of esophageal cancer slated for 2015-2016 and Cancers of the Head and Neck for 2016-2017. Therefore, the information above is still (7+ years) dated.   Nonetheless, I did quickly pull a 2009 Systemic Review and a 2012 Meta-Analysis from Google Scholar:    Loria, D., Barrios, E., & Zanetti, R. (2009). Cancer and yerba mate consumption: a review of possible associations. Revista Panamericana de Salud PÃºblica, 25(6), 530-539. Al-Dakkak, I., & Ternouth, A. (2012). MatÃ© intake and risk of oral and pharyngeal cancers. Evidence-based dentistry, 13(1), 18-19.    From the Abstracts, it appears there is further postulation on the etiology. Nonetheless the literature review is of all available studies spanning until 2008. Similarly the meta-analysis is of all available studies until 2009. Therfore, it is very unlikely to be of much difference than the AICR/WCRF report.   EDIT: Added a link to the AICR/WCRF report"

Legumes also absorb water and expand when cooked (but less so than grains), so a cup of uncooked lentils might have 60g of fiber but a cup of cooked lentils only has 16g.    Point is, you're way overestimating how much fiber you're getting from your current diet.  You need to look up the nutrition info for cooked grains and legumes since you can't eat them raw.  For example, if you eat 2 cups of cooked lentils and 2 cups of cooked barley per day (which is quite a lot of food by the way), you'd only be getting about 44g of fiber, which is a perfectly reasonable amount.

In the end it comes down to what your best is for long-term weight loss and health. Being able to stick to something is more important than aiming for dietary perfection."

nutrition,3c2qth,venolo,-8,Sat Jul 4 13:00:24 2015 UTC,Vegetables should be a priority. Fruits are essentially sugary vegetables.
nutrition,3c2qth,MPfiff,3,Sat Jul 4 14:03:17 2015 UTC,Yes ignore the actual science; fruits have sugar and sugar is poison!
nutrition,3c2qth,pajamakitten,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"Fruits have sugar, excess sugar is bad for you but the amount of sugar in fruit as a percentage of the whole mass of the fruit is pretty negligible outside of dates and dried fruit. You don't want to live of the stuff but unless you're a fruitarian then you are unlikely to be eating enough fruit to worry about fructose."
nutrition,3c2qth,fitwithmindy,8,Sat Jul 4 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"Body fat is a form of energy storage so are glycogen. All foods get broken down into amino acids (protein), glucose/fructose(carbs), fatty acids (fat), alcohol (if you drink). All of these contain energy: protein: 4cal/g, carb: 4cal/g, fat:9cal/g, alcohol:7cal/g. When you eat more calorie than you need every day, your body will first store the excess carb as glycogen until they are full then carb be will be stored fat. Protein will be first used as tissue and muscle building and the excess can be converted into glucose for energy and also be stored body fat. Fat will also first be used for hormone and other basic body functioning and excess will also be stored as body fat. The only way for your body to use body fat or not store body fat is to not eat more calories than you burn every day. For carbs you can technically eat more than you burn until your glycogen is full.   So the short answer is how much you eat is more important. You can eat all healthy food but too much of good thing is still bad. The caution is that your body also needs micros and fibers. You need to eat healthy foodds to get the nutrients and also help you feel full longer :-)"

But, I started to realize I wasn't actually feeling as good as I could as far as gastrointestinal stuff goes & general energy.   I'd suggest you try roasting all your vegetables first, it makes them much tastier. Put a bit of oil on 'em (I use avocado oil because of it's high heat tolerance) and some salt or spices and roast them (you can google for a specific veggie's guidelines). I've found out I like asparagus, broccoli, and brussel sprouts a lot!   You can also try sautÃ©ing them into other foods. I eat a (chickpea) omelette with spinach in it. It just gives a bit of a crunch, other than that, no taste! Once you develop a taste for it, you'll be surprised you can eat them raw & steamed. I love steamed broccoli now."

However, there is emerging evidence that fasting sort of like you're describing could have various health benefits and can influence your metabolism in ways that calorie restriction could not.  I will direct you to /r/intermittentfasting where you can delve into their archives and find out all of the latest data on it.  Just be wary - most nutrition science is limited thus far! :-|"

nutrition,3c1kxs,StuWard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"I think the effects on weight loss would be pretty much the same.  There was a study comparing alternate day fasting (eat freely one day, eat very low calorie the next) versus eating 25% less calories. After 6 months both groups had lost about 11 pounds of body fat. Other effects were pretty much the same on both methods of dieting.  http://www.fasebj.org/content/29/1_Supplement/254.1.short"
nutrition,3c1kxs,MPfiff,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:26:14 2015 UTC,"From the abstract: ""75% restriction fast day alternated""   So, we don't know how many calories they were actually consuming on their ""fast day"". Almost guaranteed to be over 250 though (assuming that they eat at least 1000 calories per day on a normal day) which wouldn't give you an accurate representation of alternate day fasting. A water fast means no calories, or the threshold being at the very most 200 calories, or no more than 10 per hour. The experts over at /r/fasting and /r/intermittentfasting would be able to tell you more precisely but it affects your blood sugar and your insulin and as someone's pointed out already our body is controlled by the hormones regulating it. I'm not a nutritionist but I've read that for a true fast it's important to stay under these numbers to really starve your body. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that a study with only 75% decrease in calorie intake would not accurately show the same effects of a 90-100% decrease in calorie intake."
nutrition,3c1kxs,bezjones,0,Sat Jul 4 09:59:27 2015 UTC,"I would say yes, but I am not sure how to specifically quantify that. I think your metabolism would change quite differently if you had no food for 3 days straight once per week, vs. getting some food every day, only not as much. You may actually gain weight if you did regular 3 day fasts, as you are essentially training your body that food is rare and to hold on to it when you get it."

My gut tells me that a regular 3-day fast period (as in, you don't eat for 3 days a week, for weeks and weeks at a time, possibly months at a time) is quite a different beast than a lessening of average caloric intake. Doing a random 36-hour fast once every 4 months or whatever is unlikely to change your metabolism in any lasting way."

Greek yogurt is an easily digestible protein source that will also help you meet your calcium needs. Protein sources that are lower in fat will be easier to digest."

Grass-fed beef or chicken should be allowed for protein; quality meat is digested fairly easily in most individuals. Fruit is also a great food for weak stomachs. Grass-fed butter may be useful because butyrate is great for intestinal health.  This definitely sounds like a gut bacteria issue"

nutrition,3c03xb,DerBibliothekar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"Can the body live on carbs alone? Nope. You need fat, protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals too.   But all whole-food sources of carbs (ie. Fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, and legumes) have protein and fat in them. It's basically impossible to eat a variety of whole foods and be deficient in protein/fat.

High carb low fat low protein diets are stupid. DNL does not produce an optimal fatty acid mixture, as far as I know it can only produce palmitate, but it definitely can not produce omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Triglycerides and VLDL will shoot up. So will pro-inflammatory cytokines. Hormones will be greatly messed up. Lack of omega 3, cholesterol, and proper hormonal status will take a toll on the brain. Low protein intake also causes impaired glucose utilization in the brain for some reason, you need at least 11-15% protein to prevent this. High carbohydrate intake alone can cause metabolic abnormalities: insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes to name a few.

nutrition,3bylcj,danger-pony,2,Fri Jul 3 05:35:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  It's an extremely easy way to take in a lot of protein and it's pretty cheap.  Usually about .70 cents per serving.  There isn't a single downside.  Another thing I recommend is not to cheap out on your protein.  If you buy the cheapest protein you find on some random website, you'll regret it. It'll taste bad and won't mix well (probably). http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/top50.htm  lists the popular brands and there are often sweet deals like buy 1 get 1 50% or come with little extras.  I usually go with the basic gold standard whey.  There's a lot of different broscience relating to how much protein you should consume.  One person might tell you to only get 1 gram per lb of lean body mass.  Another might tell you between 1-1.5grams per lb of body weight.  I honestly can't tell you which is the best and neither can anyone else tbh.  All I can say is if you do decide to go on the higher end of protein consumption, space it out throughout your day.  Don't eat more than around 40-50g in any one meal.  Hope it helps."

nutrition,3bylcj,Lethroblacken,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"Im in agreement with what they said. Especially with rlllflex saying you shouldn't skimp out of your protein. Make sure you are really looking into the protein you are buying as there is no real governing body that says what they can put in the powder and what they cannot put in it. For all you know you could be getting flour with sugar. A few hints with picking out your supplements:  -Look for a USP seal. They are the best ""governing body"" when it comes to supplements. It cost money to get this seal so the companies usually wont screw the consumer over.  -Look for a reasonable sugar count unless you want disgusting powder or overly sweet powder where the sugar stays with you.  -Also look into the types of protein powders there are. Doing a research will go a long way. I mean after all who wants their gains to disappear because they bought crap protein.   -FYI it is better to get your macros from food than supplements because of the other benefits that goes along with food. Try looking into other ways to get protein. Nuts, beans, greek yogurt (like you said) along with egg whites and a meal of chicken should be more than enough to get you to where you need to be."

His process was a hypoallergenic diet and then proceeded with an allergist. Thankfully it eventually went away, unexplained and he could gradually incorporate his usual food back into his diet. They think it may have been autoimmune brought out by extra stress.   Anyway, you should absolutely reach out to your local dietitian and take their advice. In the mean time, you may want to stick to a low fiber diet - well cooked veg if you can tolerate it. LEAN meats - low fat overall to aid with the GERD (may want to avoid red meat as well). And small meals throughout the day to ease the GERD and put less stress on your digestive tract.

nutrition,3bxhp2,evange,2,Mon Jul 6 16:21:23 2015 UTC,"I too was diagnosed with EoE and GERD last summer, and had to take out the exact same foods as you for a couple months. I won't say it didn't suck, because it did, but after the first couple days you get used to it and what foods you can/can not have.   My diet included eating much more vegetables and fruits (the less acidic ones) along with all kinds of meat, unbreaded of course. Typically I had some form of potatoes every day as well, as they are pretty filling and a good substitute for bread. Also I was able to find corn and rice substitutes for many things, which was nice. For me, the first food group I added back was wheat. There's just a lot of things that use wheat and so my meals became easier to find after I added that back in. For me, I didn't end up finding any problem foods, which was kind of disappointing, but at the same time my diet is back to normal now. From what my doctor told me there is a lot that is unknown about EoE, and so food may not be actually causing it for me. I take medicine every day for my GERD and honestly I feel pretty much normal again, even eating the same diet.   I'm supposed to get my EoE checked again in the next couple years to see what's going on with it, but for now I don't really notice I have it anymore. Before when I would eat I sometimes would feel my throat constrict, and it felt like I was almost choking, but really the food was just going down my esophagus really slowly because it was inflamed. But after starting my medicine for GERD that feeling has never happened again. I know your doc said they aren't related, but I no longer feel those EoE symptoms after taking the medicine.  So I hope for you that you can eventually go back to your old diet (at least for the most part), or you find the problem foods quick! The diet isn't much fun, but it'll hopefully be over soon!"

I'd almost rather find that X food is the problem and get on with my life avoiding it rather than to go through the whole process and not find anything, like the allergy tests. But it would also be great to just be able to eat without fear.   I've not really had any big symptoms, except for choking on food which landed me in the ER and got the initial diagnosis. I've tried to be more aware, so I've been noticing sore throats and congestion after certain foods but it's subtle and could be unrelated. The same thing with GERD, I very rarely get an upset stomach so it's hard knowing what to avoid and where I can sneak a taste. If I could bargain, I'd keep eggs and caffeine, haha. We go through a ton of eggs and I need caffeine to keep up with the toddler."
nutrition,3bxhp2,eraser-dust,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:40:32 2015 UTC,"I have eosinophilic esophagitis too, and diet was basically not discussed. I was told my EE was a related to my environmental (dust, pollen, mold, etc) allergies, and I was prescribed an asthma puffer which I was told to swallow, not inhale.   Eosinophilic esophagitis has a large overlap of symptoms with GERD, so I think if they suspect EE, a lot of doctors will first go through the treatment for GERD, to rule it out as a possibility. Did you have an endoscopy? Tissue samples from your esophagus will confirm if it's EE, although the doctor may find that too invasive if you haven't exhausted your other options yet.   There are also two main types of EE: the kind common in adults which is most often related to environmental or oral allergies and is usually asymptomatic or mild, and the kind more common in kids which could be considered a category of extreme food allergy, where basically your digestive tract will throw a fit when exposed to certain foods.   I'm guessing they recommended an elimination diet to see if they can pinpoint any specific allergy or trigger, and while that's a huge annoyance and inconvenience for you, it's a very valuable diagnostic tool. Plus, what if you discover through being on an elimination diet that eggs, dairy, and coffee make you feel like shit? It becomes a lot easier to give up foods when you realize how awful they were making you feel."

I do know I have some oral allergies to peanuts and bananas, not the life threatening kind, but my throat burns/itches and I might  have stomach upset. I don't have any environmental allergies that I know of.  I agree that it is a worthwhile exercise, I just have to make a lot of adjustments- I'm sure you've been there.

These episodes were also happening after I would eat, which seemed strange to me, as I'd always heard of people fainting because they hadn't eaten enough. Then I realized that it was happening on days I was eating more carbs than usual (pizza/wings/beer night, 5-course Christmas dinner with pasta course, etc.). I eat low-carb and high-fat now and it has not happened again.   The potential confounding factor I feel I should mention is that since I've started to eat this way that I increased my electrolyte consumption, which could have had a favorable impact on my blood pressure and circulation, thereby preventing me from fainting. This is by no means professional medical advice, but again, I just wanted to chime in because I went through something similar and found a solution for myself, when the doctor's advice of ""this can just start to happen to young women at your age"" was really no help at all."

I first started by just eating healthy and working out a couple times a week, to only eating salads and running every single day. At that point I was eating about 900 calories and exercising 300 of them off a day. I loved how fast the weight was coming off and so it only encouraged me to restrict and eat less (basically anorexia) even more. That wasn't sustainable for me because I love food, so bulimia took over. That was 5 years ago and I'm just now getting help for it. It's taken over my life and my metabolism is severely damaged, I have digestion issues, and if I eat one piece of ""unhealthy"" food my body seems to retain all of it. I wish so much that I had put on the brakes and lost weight in a healthier, yet slower way (which is annoying, I know).

So people get to their ""goal weight"" and look in the mirror and go ""But I still don't look like I want!"" and the cycle continues. You pretty much said it yourself.

You should always try to be eating healthy and normally. Diet in a sustainable way. 500 calories a day is nowhere near sustainable. Do you know what happens when you eat too few calories for an extended period of time?  ..You binge. Because your body is screaming at you and crying for the energy it wants and needs. Then you get depressed, because you consider the binge a screw up. Then you restrict to lose the weight again.. And the cycle continues.  Please stop this... You want to be happy.

Eating below 1000 calories isn't a healthy way to lose weight. Checking your post history you're already underweight at 96. You probably know this, but the recommended minimum weight for someone of your height is 102.  You're concerned about binging because you're dangerously restricting your diet and your instincts are fighting against that. There is a chance that you have damaged your metabolism from this behavior. My normal advice to be healthy would be to eat about 500 calories over maintenance with a focus on protein and add light resistance training with a goal of a 15 pound gain. In your case that's around 2100 calories per day.  However, you don't want to be healthy- you want to feel a sense of control over what you eat and the number on the scale.

In china in the summer, we would make cold tofu dish for weight loss and in winter we make mapong tofu or other hot tofu soup. Tofu has been known to help weight loss. They are very low in calories.   Tempeh is fermented soy and you need to be careful the macro. Some companies mix it with other stuff and its calories can be quite high. But in general they are good but read nutrition and ingredient lables.   Miso is another fermented soy and good in moderation. Watch out for sodium content (can be very high).  Soy sauce is also fermented and you need to make sure you are not getting the American brand chemical soy sauce.

nutrition,3bt5ag,sloppybeaver,4,Wed Jul 1 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"You gain weight ultimately by eating an amount of calories more than you expend.  Ignoring protein (it has a much higher thermic effect than carbohydrate or fat, i.e. more is ""lost"" in its digestion), neither carbs nor fat are more likely to make you fat when eating a caloric surplus, within reason.  If you're at maintenance calories (neither gaining nor losing weight) and add additional carbohydrate such that you're above maintenance, you don't ""store the carbs as fat,"" you actually offset burning fat such that you're storing FAT that you're eating.  This is because, in humans, the pathway to create fat from non-fat sources (de novo lipogenesis) is not terribly efficient and really only occurs under extraordinary circumstances.  Whereas the pathway of turning dietary fat into stored body fat is trivially easy.  If you are at maintenance as above and add aditional calories in the form of fat, you once again store the fat you're eating.  So, in either case, under normal circumstances (i.e. you not eating something like < 10% calories of fat and an unbelievable amount of carbohydrate), increases in body fat are invariably coming from the fat you are ingesting when eating a caloric surplus, contrary to conventional internet wisdom.  However, carbs over maintenance and fat over maintenance wind up making you fat to (more or less) the same degree, so the net effect is that it doesn't actually matter.  In short, you don't have to worry about ""too many carbs"" more than you have to worry about ""too much fat.""  Assuming you're getting adequate protein, you can cut any combination of the two to create sustained fat loss.  So the metric you're looking for is obvious here - are you actually losing fat?  If you have access to somebody who can do caliper testing that'd be helpful.  Monitoring a combination of scale weight and waist circumference works pretty well, too."

For example, just one of these tuna packages in water contains 17g of protein, and handfuls of essential vitamins, without any of the unnecessary carbs or sugars.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong (I haven't touched a physiology textbook in a while), but I believe there is one area of the kidney where Na/K are reabsorbed together (so if Na intake is high, you'd reabsorb less, therefore eliminating more potassium).  There is then another area where Na excretion is paired with K reabsorption, which is theoretically a good thing, but maybe not enough to make up the gap in most diets.  Diets higher in salt are more likely to be lower in potassium.  The Na/K link with hypertension and general health might actually be explained through other mechanisms as well - but the above just perhaps just one reason why balancing Na/K intake is important."

As for the sodium-potassium-pump: due to both being cations, which you correctly stated, in order to have the pump run there's energy use, so it's not simply diffusion or the like, but an ATP-dependant transport, catalyzed by the sodium-potassium-ATPase."

If you are taking in excess water, then you will just pee it out as your body tries to maintain homeostasis.  The benefit of taking in the excess water though is that you maintain perfusion to vital organs, especially the kidneys.  That being said, you would have to take in a pretty good amount of sodium for an extended period in order for your body systems to decompensate."
nutrition,3borpu,medlicker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting question. We learned in physiology that sodium follows water, which means that if you drink more water, your kidneys will produce more urine and more sodium will be excreted. This is true. But one should also remember that our body releases a hormone called Aldosterone, which actually increases the level of sodium in the body and results in blood pressure increase. So drinking more water is not enough as at one point Aldosterone will be activated to prevent hyponatremia (too low level of sodium). The best way is to eat less sodium (e.g. use salt with moderation and avoid salty foods)."
nutrition,3borpu,MrsSpice,0,Thu Jul 2 09:07:24 2015 UTC,"ETA: I am confused why this is being down voted and would be curious to know why people feel it doesn't add to the discussion.... This information comes from my two weeks spent getting evaluated at Mayo Clinic. It isn't from a doctor who does not know what s/he is talking about. It comes from a team made up of 8 specialists at one of the top medical centers in the world.   I have learned about this topic due a health issue where I have to sodium and fluid load. I have to pay attention to the balance as I'm loading or things get out of whack.  You probably wouldn't believe the amount of sodium I consume. Sodium overload has never been an issue. Your body will retain water to a certain point, and after that you'll just pee it out.  An easier thing to mess up IMO is not getting enough sodium, especially in a diet low in processed, pre-packaged foods. When I first started having to sodium/fluid load, I messed it up. I was always thirsty no matter how much I drank and could not figure it out. As it turns out, my ratio was off. I was washing out sodium with too much water, which lead me to be thirsty and drink more water, but my body couldn't hold on to the water because I didn't have enough sodium.   I figured since my blood work was fine, my sodium levels were in at a healthy level. There is absolutely no need for it to be a routine test in asymptomatic patients, but as it turns out, the only effective way to identify this problem in many people is a 24 hour urine collection. The levels in your blood being healthy doesn't mean the levels everywhere else are healthy as well, or that your body is utilizing it properly. Your body works hard to keep the levels of electrolytes in blood within a particular range. This means things usually have to be pretty off before blood work reflects it."

I used to think if I made a few bad choices I'd just restart later in the week, month, etc... and never get there but it's easier to think that it's a minor setback than make a huge deal about it and be more negative as a result. Just start back immediately instead of thinking ""I'll be better next week."" Make yourself accountable now.  If you want to stop late night snacks eat a big dinner a bit later at night so that you feel too full to graze. Choose food you enjoy eating so you are looking forward to the healthy option instead of dreading it. Choose things which taste unhealthy but aren't e.g. banana ""ice cream"" or a chocolate protein smoothie to trick yourself into believing you're not missing out on the yummy foods.  And if you track how you're losing weight/looking better as a result of the lifestyle change then just use that to remind yourself of why you made the change in the first place. :)  Ruts happen, but it's how you react to them, I find, that makes the difference."

Acutely toxic levels unlikely except in botched parenteral nutrition.  The most common hypervitaminosis is for preformed vitamin A (retinol), but hypervitaminosis D & E are possible with supplements. Among water soluble vitamins, high-dose B2 is suspected in phototoxicity, while nicotinic acid (niacin) causes flushing via GPR109A and TRPV1 receptors, but this also has therapeutic uses.   Most essential minerals have acute toxicity in excess, but acute mineral toxicity is most common from iron, manganese & selenium   In the longer term, more nutrients are harmful in excess, including some that have few acute adverse effects: calories (any), fructose, other added sugars, refined carbs, trans-fats, long-chain saturated fats, choline, calcium, phosphorus. In animal longevity studies, high protein diets lead to shorter lifespans than either high-carb or high-fat diets.  Dietary cholesterol doesn't matter much given Western trans-fat, myristate & palmitate intake, serum levels, and lower absorption, but matters a great deal to those attempting to achieve 50-70 mg/dL LDL by dietary means.

Too much sodium causes water retention(bloating) making you appear fat and causes hypertension along with increasing the chance of a stroke. Yet you need sodium but we typically get way too much in out diets. Like 3 to 5 times the daily recommended amount..   Lots of micronutrients are extremely toxic at high levels. I personally have problems with iron which I've only recently discovered.   I recommend downloading my fitness pal and doing a food journal for a week or two to see what you are getting too much of and not enough of.  Good luck.

Carbohydrates are sugars but not all sugar/carbohydrates are built the same. Try to eat complex carbohydrates that your body digest much slower than simple carbs. For example Oatmeal or brown rice as opposed to donuts or Gatorade. Straight up avoid sugar cane, high fructose corn syrup as much as possible.

nutrition,3bni1f,karrotsandkilos,2,Tue Jun 30 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"[EDIT: added paragraphs for ease of reading]   Everything, even water, has a level where it becomes toxic. Micronutrients, as u/guidedbymonkeys mentioned are extremely toxic at high levels. I'd like to amend this statement- some micronutrients are extremely toxic at very low levels! Metal minerals have relatively low upper intake recommendations. Copper, for example, is toxic in doses that are measured in micrograms which is one one-thousandth of a milligram (mg).   As far as macronutrients go- trans fats and sugar will cause the most damage through compromised cell structure, free radical formation, their effect on hormone signaling, etc. Too much protein can lead to acidity via protein oxidation.   The body's daily cholesterol needs are actually quite high. Your body can synthesize cholesterol to meet the total demand because it would be hard to meet your needs through diet. You probably synthesize about 3g of cholesterol per day- about 10 times the RDA here in the US. There are control mechanisms in place in your body where, if you eat a ton of dietary cholesterol, you will not synthesize as much.   As for sodium, too little is correlated with cardiovascular disease related deaths and too much also puts you at high risk. This makes sense because sodium is an electrolyte, the heart needs it for electrical signaling, and too little will cause problems as well. A 2011 study showed that the risk curve is u-shaped, with the highest risk at the extremes. The sweet spot for intake seems to be between 4-6 grams per day!"

Hemp seeds, on the other hand, provide more protein than either chia and flax [10 grams of protein per 3 tablespoons] but it has virtually no fiber. Also, hemp provides 3 times as much omega-6 as omega-3 (as a way to balance the omegas in your diet, hemp is not useful). The nutritional benefits of hemp seeds: high in iron, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, thiamin, and zinc.

There are 13 amino acids, called ""essential amino acids,"" which our body MUST get from outside sources, as our body cannot produce them on their own. When someone says that a food is a ""complete protein,"" or has all the amino acids, they mean that all 13 of the essential amino acids are represented within the food. There are only specific non-meat foods that meet these requirements up front.  You cannot live without all of the essential amino acids."
nutrition,3boar6,emmg90,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:36:05 2015 UTC,"Your protein goal is 2.5 g/kg, that is excessive. Muscle synthesis rates are achieved at 0.8 g/kg for sedentary people, 1.4 g/kg for endurance athletes, 1.8 g/kg for strength athletes. Eating more than that is just a waste of money.  Your carbs are 50%, fat is 16%. That is not conductive to fat loss. Carbohydrate restriction is a far better choice for fat loss than fat restriction. Ditch the pasta in particular, it is completely inappropriate for your goals. Dietary fat is required to maintain hormonal and cognitive health, you should not skimp on it.  Here are the steps that you should follow when designing a diet for fat loss:   Determine your target calories. Do not have more than 30% deficit. Set a carbohydrate target, somewhere between 20 and 120 grams. Lower values require electrolyte supplementation and an induction phase. Calculate your protein requirements based on your weight and activity levels. Fill the rest of your calories by fat. Maintain a balanced intake of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, and omega 6:3 ratio.   Visit /r/loseit and /r/keto for more information.  I would recommend a more varied diet than your current plan. Incorporate vegetables, berries. Eat organ meats and beef as well. At the very least put your diet plan in an online planner to see the nutrient profile.  Nothing wrong with multivitamins, but they are supplements, they should not be your first choice for nutrients."

You can read about it here.  Drink as much green tea, black tea, or coffee as you like - it may wake you up and may relieve stress. You might feel energized to do more physical activity and choosing tea or coffee instead of sugary drinks will cut down on your calorie intake.   None of this will change the speed of your metabolism or how your body processes calories. If you think you may have hypothyroidism, visit your doctor. They can preform a very simple test to confirm such a diagnosis and prescribe drugs to fix it. If you want to burn more calories each day, focus on building up your lean muscle mass because lean muscle costs your body more energy to maintain."
nutrition,3bivkz,slothoncoffee,0,Mon Jun 29 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"It would help if you actually researched your claims, which are completely false btw.  The evidence points in a completely different direction.   Effects of Green tea on fat oxidation: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307170/  It also can act as a carbohydrate blocker: Interventions suggest that carbohydrate inhibition is sufficient enough to, at a dose of 100mg green tea catechins, inhibit up to 25% of the carbohydrate content of a coingested meal. - Taken from Examine.com  So it literally does interfere with how the body processes calories."
nutrition,3bivkz,slothoncoffee,6,Tue Jun 30 08:54:39 2015 UTC,"Actually I did do some research...  Your one study with 14 participants is not enough evidence to support that green tea significantly promotes fat loss. Here are several similar or related studies (including reviews) that found no metabolic effect or were inconclusive:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24172767 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247713 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21736785  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21649457 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247713  As for the Examine statistic. I pulled up the original article - I've looked for 20 minutes and cannot find any other studies besides that one that found a similar effect. And that abstract doesn't even say how many subjects there were. However, this one other study found that the effect does not contribute to weight loss: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18377102  So no,the evidence doesn't point in that direction and my claims are not completely false. I'm not saying green tea won't help weight loss, in fact, my post lists several ways drinking green tea can help promote someone to eat fewer calories and get more exercise. But there is no conclusive evidence that green tea affects metabolism or significantly promotes fat loss by it's own nature and there's a lot of evidence that is doesn't.   If you look through OP's account there all these weird posts about every way to lose weight and put on muscle besides the very simple process of consuming fewer calories than burned and working out. So I am sorry if I over simplified for your tastes. Maybe I should have said, ""There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that any of this will change the speed of your metabolism or how your body processes calories,""  but I was genuinely trying to help and focusing on methods we know works is much more helpful then relying on drugs and tea/coffee to get fit."

The very first step is to separate all of the milk fat from the solids/liquid, and then add a precisely measured amount of fat back to the fat-free skim milk to produce each category of milk.  Whole milk is literally just fat-free milk that has had more of the fat portion added back to it.  If you're buying pasteurized, homogenized milk in a chain supermarket, it's most definitely been produced like this unless it says otherwise on the package.    Also, assuming the least processed version of something is better is a fallacy, as there are plenty of foods that are downright poisonous when consumed in their raw and/or unprocessed state."

Starch, protein, and fat are supposed to be digested in the small intestines, while fiber is fermented in the large intestines (resulting in lots of vitamins).  If your gut is upset, things can move faster than they should resulting in starch/protein/fat being fermented instead of being absorbed (hence egg farts), which can then further irritate the gut.

This study illustrates that consumption habits have a real impact on pesticide exposure in terms of intake levels, number and type of pesticides, representing a potential risk of dietary exposure. Except for organochlorine compounds, the vegetarian population may be more exposed to pesticide residues than the general population due to specific dietary habits. Thus, this population should be considered for risk assessment of pesticide residues.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19707917  If we're talking mercury, OK so don't eat large predators like swordfish.

nutrition,3bjtnv,Runesr4nerds,2,Mon Jun 29 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"Stir fry can become your friend. Doesn't even need to be traditional stir fry, but lots of mixed veggies with seasoning. Seasoning is going to be key for you. I recommend investing in a crock pot as well. It's highly versatile. You can prep a week's worth of shredded chicken in it, then season/sauce the chicken in a variety of ways. A good, tasty marinara is good to top protein and/or veggies with. I frequently do a bowl of seasoned veggies, marinara, chicken or turkey, mix together and it's delicious. You can also top that with a fried egg and crack the yolk down the middle of it all.   Really though, finding go to seasonings and whipping up a few usable sauces/dressings will make a world of difference. You'll have to experiment, figure out what you like best."

Not only is it loaded with sugar, the oats themselves are processed for shelf life and so bypass much of the fiber benefit (of the little left in it).

nutrition,3bior0,ARNutrition,2,Mon Jun 29 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"Not completely sure of the nutritional content but from what I know the pros are theyâre made of oats, so youâre getting slow release carbs which are good for keeping you going and I would consider oats healthy; however thereâs usually loads of added sugars in these kind of things.    As a general guide for sugar content, per 100g of food, 5g or less is considered low sugar, 22.5g or above is high. So if theyâre high sugar, treat them like other high sugar foods â fine in small amounts.   It depends what else youâre eating though, if the rest of your diet is pretty healthy and low in added sugars, and you like these bars, then enjoy eating them â itâs the overall diet that matters overall for health, not just certain foods.   Snacking between meals is fine by the way, so long as youâre not going over your energy needs. If youâre regularly hungry maybe plan a snack for that time and choose healthier foods and have the bars only occasionally?"

What's the point of minimizing the calories to the point of 1100, if you're going to eat 2300 calories per day anyway? If you are into eating meat, lean beef is a good source of zinc, and lean pork a good source of B1. Might allow you to get rid of oyster and sunflower seed. Personally I find ""supplements"" like that annoying. Have you considered the dangers of having a one-sided diet, e.g. broccoli every day? What I do is to optimize based on an average of at least 4 vegetables, and then cycle them in and out over the weeks. It doesn't matter if you're sometimes below 100% in some nutrients, as long as you're also above 100% on a regular basis."

But i asked my mom, a nurse, the same questions and she said sometimes people come in with severe nutrient deficiencies. They give them a multivitamin and it at least seems to make a huge impact.  Don't rely on them as a sole source of nutrients, but they won't hurt you.  My personal opinion is that they're cheap, they're not harmful, so in the off chance they do work, why not?

It takes at least a full order of magnitude more effort and energy to refute bullshit than to dish it.  Magnesium oxide is absorbed at about 23%. Citrate form is about 29%. Roughly the same for foods. Remember that RDAs  are set for intake and already account for absorption. The reason we have different forms in supplements is largely density - mineral citrates are bulkier than oxides and carbonates. Also, citrates may absorbed better into the bloodstream, but oxides better unto cells. Multi's supplement the diet. You're probably not getting enough of something. A tablet to prevent deficiency is very cheap. Adding things like pre-formed vitamin A, D, C, K2 etc is not a bad idea given our diet and lifestyle."

I'm not an expert on human metabolism, but I'm aware of some basics, such as the phenomenon of blood volume in the circulatory system being sent to the 'core' after eating food, to supply the digestive system, and to help transport nutrients from the digested food out of the digestive system and to the rest of the body. With considering the basics of metabolism such as that, wouldn't there seem to be a fine-tuned complexity behind the process requiring other bodily resources?    Just taking a guess here, but I can imagine that the synthesis of proteins from amino acids is a complex process requiring more than just the necessary amino acids involved in order to take place. My gut feeling also says I can assume that the body prepares itself for processes like protein synthesis while metabolism is increased after eating, which is when the body would have the resources it needs to utilize amino acids -- so when a multivitamin is taken without any food on an empty stomach, metabolism having not been fired up would mean that the amino acids plopped down on top of the digestive system when it's not active, and might not even be acknowledged by the digestive tract. Some(niacin for example) end up being excreted by the body as excess."

I will link you a couple of articles below but to summarise there is really no drawback to taking Vitamin D. It is cheap, provides a myriad of health benefits, and sounds like it would give you some piece of mind.

Maybe your anxiety and other symptoms are related to what you eat, maybe not. It could be entirely unrelated.  The fact that you have an eating disorder background is relevant, because obsessively overanalyzing what you eat goes hand-in-hand with eating disorders.   The sheer specificity of what you have listed here goes far beyond what even a specialist could determine, let alone what you could self-diagnose. Like I said, food can have influences on mood. But you need to consider causes other than food for your particular problem. Because even if protein really is affecting you, you have made an enormous leap in reasoning here which borders on paranoia."
nutrition,3bfm47,cupcakeraynebowjones,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:23:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should be more specific about how I determined all this.  5 years ago I was hospitalized with a conglomerate of problems that all proved dietary. These problems in and of themselves were strange enough, including but not limited to, edema that was becoming pulmonary, liver levels (off the charts), irregular heart beat, gastrointestinal issues et cetera.... My family doctor was convinced I was dying. I had to see specialists for months and no one could connect the dots. With no official diagnosis symptoms were treated and only ""clue"" was that virtually all the problems disappeared with a super-restricted intake of nothing but whole foods.  I'm trying to give the readers digest here so bear with, and if you want more info just ask.   Fast forward since then, I have lived for the last few years via a diet of intermittent fasting, carefully monitored meals and bi-weekly bloodwork (complete metabolic panels).   What I am getting at is that I don't over-analyze due to my history of eating disorders in the sense you are assuming. I do so because its doctors orders based on these strange problems. Now, I DO however believe these complications arose due to my self-abusive past. So in that sense you are correct.  Finally, I can't agree I'm making a leap in judgement because as a result of the aforementioned, I am acutely aware of how what I eat effects me. In fact, I could detail in so far as to tell you within roughly how many hours it takes for various effects to occur.   The protein issue is cut and dry. Under 30 grams a day from any singular source and I have a completely stable mood with zero cognitive roller-coasters until I become calorically deficit to the point I feel like shit. Eventually, due to my other restrictions, I always need to increase caloric intake by way of protein rich foods and I have cataloged these results for quite some time.  To add insult to injury, the problems with edema I suffer seem best combated with a protein rich diet and I feel like this results in my constantly selecting the lesser evil in a manner of speaking.  Finally I will completely agree with your final statement that I border on paranoia. For years now, dietary problems have driven me to the point where I fear the result of almost everything I eat as well as the result of not eating. I can't help be paranoid and the fact that I am bat-shit-crazy to begin with doesn't make it any easier! LoL  EDIT: This brings me back to initial statement I made above about the doctors more or less assuming the cognition/emotional issues that ensue with protein are in fact non-issues. When dealing with the various problems I've had, doctors have been far more concerned with whether or not my heartbeat is regular and I don't have fluid in my lungs thus making ""hyper-activity as the result of consuming fatty fish"" a way distant ""second"".  Interestingly enough (since I got into the whole story), despite all these problems, I have achieved a stasis via my diet that allows me to live as though I've hardly any problems period. I simply take a water pill to keep the edema down and consume in the restricted manner I described and go about my life as though nothing is really wrong."

As far as I know, pork and turkey have very similar amino acid profiles. Searching Google, I find a study which says that chicken and beef protein have pretty much indistinguishable effects on the body.  I find it easy to believe you have symptoms from food, but when your symptoms are psychological, like mood, it's extremely difficult to determine how much of it is in your head. You could have the same reaction to the same food repeatedly, test it and prove it over and over, but only have that reaction because it's what you expect. You could also wind up getting the culprit wrong-- someone who has a problem with dairy because of casein might wrongly assume lactose is the problem. And diet can influence a problem without being the root cause, or diet can combine with other outside factors. Keep looking into it, just be slow to make assumptions is my advice."
nutrition,3bfm47,koobazaur,2,Mon Jun 29 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"Have you ever performed double blind experiments to determin this? While food does affect our mood, the sheer specifity of your issues and past with eating disorders could suggest this is in part mental as much as physical.   Curious if you would still experience the exact symptoms if you ate protein but genuinely did not its kind. But that would require someone preparing your meals and probably blending all the meat and drowning in spices beyond any recognizability."

Rather than spice it I think blending into soup/smoothie would be a better ""mask"" or at the very least, less labor intensive.

Protein by analysis of total nitrogen, either by Dumas or Kjeldahl methods. Total fat, traditionally by an solvent extraction, but often now by secondary methods such as NMR. Ash (total inorganic matter) by combustion at 550C. Estimated dietary fibre by various AOAC methods such as 985.29. Sodium (and thereby Salt) either by flame photometry, AA or ICP-OES. Total sugars, normally by a liquid chromatography technique, such as IC-HPAED or HPLC-RI, Fatty acids by GC-FID.

End-applications include adhesives and glues, agricultural adjuvants, building materials, personal-care products, medical devices, detergents and surfactants, packaging, children's toys, modelling clay, waxes, paints, printing inks and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, and textiles. Phthalates are also frequently used in soft plastic fishing lures, caulk, paint pigments, and sex toys made of so-called ""jelly rubber"". Phthalates are used in a variety of household applications such as shower curtains, vinyl upholstery, adhesives, floor tiles, food containers and wrappers, and cleaning materials. Personal-care items containing phthalates include perfume, eye shadow, moisturizer, nail polish, liquid soap, and hair spray.[8]  In studies of rodents exposed to certain phthalates, high doses have been shown to change hormone levels and cause birth defects.[7]  Much of the current research on effects of phthalate exposure has been focused on children and men's health.[18] However, women may be at higher risk for potential adverse health effects of phthalates due to increased cosmetic use. Diethyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate are especially ubiquitous in cosmetics and personal care products.[18] According to in vivo and observational studies by Davis et al. (1994) and Lopez-Carillo et al. (2010), there is an association between phthalate exposure and endocrine disruption leading to development of breast cancer. Furthermore, it has been well-documented that endocrine disruptors such as phthalates can be additive, so even very small amounts can interact with other chemicals to have cumulative, adverse ""cocktail effects"" [19]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phthalate  So is it true?  Looks that way.  Is it harmful at high doses?  Probably.  Are you ingesting too much?  I doubt it."

If you eat too much, you'll gain fat.  You don't magically put on more muscle.  Everyone who bulks, eventually cuts, so why not just skip that middle step and eat a high quality (e.g. meat, non-starchy veggies, some potatoes), adequate calorie diet?  Your body is really, really good at telling you to eat more if you workout.  Just listen to it and stay away from junk food and too much booze and you'll be fine.  I also think obsessing about protein shakes after a workout is in the weeds as well.  Your body isn't going to suddenly not put on muscle because you didn't eat soon enough.  I suggest watching this.  It's long, but worth the time.

If you want to advance this sinple no cooking idea, use the blender to make smoothies from fruit around the house. Add a bit of broccoli or kale.   If you want to go a step further, no hummus option is to steam veggies. Simplest way is put any veggie in a bowl, add an inch of water, and cover with plastic wrap.

And if they do it for long enough, it might give them diabetes whether you have a family history or not.  Juice with comparable sugar is marginally better, but as you said, the lesser of two evils.  Just my opinion here, but I'd suggest water, lemon water, lemon water sweetened with erythritol or stevia, coconut water, or homogenized milk, vaguely in that order, depending on what your kids will put up with."

nutrition,3b9ghl,infanticide_holiday,7,Sat Jun 27 12:07:27 2015 UTC,"You're right - it's little more than non-carbonated pop.  Have a look at the ingredients list together; you'll likely find a form of added sugar (sugar, glucose, fructose) as one of the first ingredients.  Try and see if lemon is actually a component of the ingredients, or if it's only flavour.  Either way, it's likely to be much further down the list.    Fruit juice counts as a serving of fruits and vegetables but only if it's 100% juice (you must find the ""100%"" somewhere on the label; a fruit beverage is NOT the same as juice).  This is because 100% juice will still contain all the vitamins/minerals from the fruit, even if it is high in sugar.  In the link above, 1 cup (250 mL) of juice is considered 1 serving.  In Canada, 1/2 cup is considered a serving.  You can only count one serving of juice towards your fruit/veg total for the day.  It is always ideal to have real fruit instead of juice when you can.  The 1/2 cup per day limit is emphasized in infant/childhood feeding guidelines for the very reason you've mentioned - tooth decay.  It's also especially suggested for younger kids because they can fill up on beverages really easily, which ends up displacing their intake of more nutritious foods.  Keep in mind again that all this fuss is about 100% fruit juice, not even sugar sweetened beverages like fruit beverages/punch, iced tea, or pop.  /u/Elminster9 already provided WHO's recommendation on added sugar - and it's really tough to meet if consuming sugar sweetened beverages.  They're more a 'once in a while' kind of treat and certainly aren't necessary to have.  Sorry for the novel, but hope this helps!"

I'm a powerlifter and some of my favorite sources of protein are: Fage Greek Yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, beans, fish, milk, nuts and nut butters, and, of course, leafy greens, which don't have as much, but come out pretty well calorie per calorie, and have lots of other health benefits in addition to protein.

I have wrote some comments on a few of their videos and the quoted studies, if you are interested I can dig them up.  Veganism isn't taken seriously because they start with an end goal, that people should not eat animal products, and invent an entire narrative with made-up bullshit to shepherd people into that direction, and to justify poor health choices. Milk causes autism, and soy is better than milk! HA! Ancel Keys and Dean Ornish can lick my carnist ass! Veganism only subverts science and should be completely removed from it.  Don't worry though, I hate Ray Peat just as much as vegans. Sugar and salt HAHAHAHA.  By the way, meat and milk do not affect bone turnover.

nutrition,3b8nsq,sol_aries,5,Sat Jun 27 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm a Registered Dietitian. Children certainly need Calcium and there are other ways of getting it besides drinking whole milk.  http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/report/nutrientsfrm?max=25&offset=0&totCount=0&nutrient1=301&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&subset=0&fg=&sort=c&measureby=m The link above is to the USDA nutrient database, which lists out foods highest in calcium for you. Mainly cheeses (go figure).   When you put the milk in the oatmeal, it is not evaporating. Rather the free water content of the milk is binding to the surface of the oatmeal and essentially being absorbed. This is what causes the oats to ""swell"" and the milk to ""disappear"". No nutrient losses are occurring during this process and calcium is an alkaline earth metal that does not deteriorate with high temperatures.  The rule of thumb with drinking milk, particularly with toddlers and children, is to ""drink milk with snacks and juice with meals"". Calcium and iron compete with each other for absorption in the intestines and foods high in iron are typically eaten at meals while foods lower in iron are typically eaten at snack time. Thus, including milk will help ensure full absorption of the calcium. The vitamin D in the dairy products will also increase the number of calcium receptors in the intestine and allow for greater calcium absorption as well.  As for the fat part -- yes, fat helps with growth because it is involved in hormone production. However, the only way to tell if the child is eating too many calories (and potentially too much fat as well) is to continually chart the child's growth on an age- and sex-specific growth chart at each visit with the pediatrician. http://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx"

I realise that there are other foods which contain and fat but it is rather difficult to calculate the nutritional content of varying foods. Up until now I do weigh any cheese he eats, and subsequently give him less milk or yoghurt.   Really though, I don't have any problem with him consuming milk or yoghurt. All I wanted to know was whether reducing milk by evaporation might affect its nutritional value. I realise that cooking porridge causes absorption. I'm talking about adding one part porridge with four parts milk, twice the amount of milk required, and after it's cooked, continuing simmering and stirring until the water in the extra milk evaporates.  I must say that your point about giving juice to toddlers contradicts everything I've read."

You can see it's heavily biased by special interests with things like McDonald's and General Mills products specifically mentioned; not to mention all the dairy. They list milk in every derivative form imaginable to dominate the list.  Things like seaweed and dried oriental radishes are not found even though they beat several of the dairy products.  Secondly, for baby products, oatmeal is fortified with iron. Adding milk is a bad idea if you want the full benefit of the added iron. Especially considering iron is added specifically because babies commonly develop a deficiency in it (perhaps because so many parents feed cow's milk to their kids)."
nutrition,3b8nsq,short_round_180,2,Sat Jun 27 11:37:48 2015 UTC,"As a nutritionist that works with kids, I see iron deficiency quite frequently and the usual culprits are the ones who give their children more than 3 cups of milk per day. She only wants to give 17 fl oz so I personally believe thats fine. (I saw someone mentioned in the comments a link relating low iron and cm consumption) Also, the reason milk is pushed has to due with the vitamin d thats added to milk. A lot of those high calcium products do not also contain that. So if your child really won't drink the milk, offer those other calcium rich foods, but also try adding foods rich in vitamin d to meet his daily needs.  Hell, or you could just be like a lot of those other moms out there who just add a shit ton of sugary chocolate syrup and their kid will drink it. (But please dont actually do that)"

If that's your main issue, then I would suggest upping your fruit intake to satisfy your sweet tooth. I've been making strawberry banana smoothies for lunch everyday for a few weeks and I think they would satisfy your cravings.   Just throw a couple handfuls of strawberries, one banana, a tablespoon of peanut butter, 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt, and then like a third of a cup of your preferred liquid (i.e milk, water, almond milk etc.) all into a blender and you're good to go. You can mix and match with whatever fruit you like. This shake does have around 400 calories though, so it's more of a meal replacement type thing than a post dinner snack. If you leave out the peanut butter you'll cut the calories in half though.   Edit: When it comes to chips you'll have to just have self control.

The cabbage takes 30 seconds to chop a piece off and chop it up. similar time for other veggies you add. After that, everything is just a spoonful of something from the fridge or the pantry- and you can use the same spoon.  If you need something you can move from the freezer to the microwave before a shower and eat it after, just cook the same thing in advance, throw it in a tupperware box, and freeze it. Engineer your habits so you get the results you want."

Buy a bunch of apples and cook 'em squishy. Add cinnamon and perhaps honey, but it's not really necessary. Squash the squishy apples and make a sauce! Keep sauce in fridge for a few weeks. Add to oatmeal each morning. Put chia seeds in almond milk. Add whatever you want (fruits and stuff, banana?) and let it thicken over night. Eat in morning. Delicious! Crisp bread! Like this!

This level was based on the uppermost amount of manganese found in the diet of healthy people.. While we support the establishment of this UL recommendation from the NAS, we would also point out that it was not based on evidence about unwanted health consequences if this dietary level was exceeded. In other words, the NAS did not have evidence about health problems that might occur if dietary intake of manganese routinely exceeded this 11 mg level. The NAS only had evidence that no such problems had been observed in U.S. adults whose average daily manganese intake was as high as 11 mg. So the NAS adopted this 11 mg UL level to err on the conservative side in its public health recommendation."

As per your example of Bananas, actually, banana's don't make magnesium, nor do they need magnesium to grow.  If your banana was grown in soil that contains a reasonable amount of magnesium, it may have 42mg of magnesium per banana on average.  But if your banana happened to be grown in soil that has little or no magnesium (it's not like minerals are spread evenly throughout the earth's crust, and according to a multitude of studies mineral levels in farm and range soils are being rapidly depleted), it will have much less, or none at all.  So, having no idea how many minerals the produce we consume has, I believe it's best to supplement to 'fill in the gaps' so to speak."

Also, why no insoluble fiber? It can help slow your digestion and also be good for you.   When calculating your carbs, or carb ratio you should do Carbs = Total carbs - all fiber. Diabetics have to do this so they can see what can affect their blood sugar and while fiber is a carb, it doesn't affect your blood sugar.  I do think this is a great idea. I have been wanting to figure out how to do this as well."
nutrition,3b5xjz,nygreenguy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:30:57 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely take the sugars into consideration. As for insoluble fibre, it's mathematically derivable from total fibre minus soluble fibre. For my purposes, it's already subsumed under total fibre, then, and the soluble component is just an extra factor when present.  To clarify your point about carbs and fibre: Right now, I'm figuring total Carbs per total Protein. Are you saying that should instead be: (total Carbs - total Fibre) / g Protein? That's an easy modification to make.  Working with spreadsheets just takes some practice, really. It's just a sophisticated form of x/y matrix. (And you can get fancy and add in z-factors, too, such as figures from other sheets or detached sections of the same sheet.) It's mostly just math, and most of that fairly simple.  I was surprised by some of what I uncovered in this. Raisins, for example, are bullshit. Very high in Calories, for what they give back. All the cereals I have in my sheet are 'healthy' ones (no Poofy Sugar Bombs or whatever like that), but raisins still come in almost last, only ahead of a couple of especially sugary granolas. (Get it together, Bear Naked.)  To my surprise, the very top one is Kix. And very high on the list is plain Cheerios, ahead of all but four others (out of over 100). Those pricey tree-bark cereals? Save your money and buy Cheerios (or its discount equivalents), my math says.  But this is partly why I'm here, to see how much those findings really make sense. I'm very grateful for your advice, thanks.  Oh, quick extra: The go-to tool for spreadsheets these days is MS Excel. It's a fine tool, but it's also a costly enterprise tool.

Using random effects models, we found that compared with never/rare consumers of whole grains, those consuming 48â80 g whole grain/d (3â5 serving/d) had an ~26% lower risk of T2D [RR = 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.80)], ~21% lower risk of CVD [RR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.85)], and consistently less weight gain during 8â13 y (1.27 vs 1.64 kg; P = 0.001). Among RCT, weighted mean differences in post-intervention circulating concentrations of fasting glucose and total and LDL-cholesterol comparing whole-grain intervention groups with controls indicated significantly lower concentrations after whole-grain interventions [differences in fasting glucose: â0.93 mmol/L (95% CI: â1.65, â0.21), total cholesterol: â0.83 mmol/L (â1.24, â0.42); and LDL-cholesterol: â0.72 mmol/L (â1.34, â0.11)]. Findings from this meta-analysis provide evidence to support beneficial effects of whole-grain intake on vascular disease prevention.    Fardet A & Boirie Y. 2014. Associations between food and beverage groups and major diet-related chronic diseases: an exhaustive review of pooled/meta-analyses and systematic reviews   The present review of 304 pooled/meta-analyses and systematic reviews published between 1950 and 2013 confirmed that plant food groups are more protective than animal food groups against diet-related chronic disease (DRCDs). Within plant food groups, grain products are more protective than fruits and vegetables. The highest level of whole-grain cereal consumption tends to be either protective against (15 references) or not associated with (10 references) diet related chronic disease risk. A higher risk of stomach cancer was reported in 1 ecological study only. Based on meta-analyses only, the highest level of wholegrain cereal consumption may significantly reduce the risks of type 2 diabetes, CVD, and cancer by a maximum of 27%, 29%, and 59%, respectively. The types of cancer associated with the highest reductions in risk were as follows: non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma (â59%), esophagus (â48%), endometrium (â45%), oral cavity/pharynx and stomach (â43%), brain (â21%), breast (â33%), pancreas (â30%), colorectum (â21%), and colon (â14%). Meta-analysis also showed that high consumption of whole-grain cereal was associated with a significant reduction in body fat of â0.48 kg for a 2- to 16-week period.   Wu H et al. 2015. Association between dietary whole grain intake and risk of mortality: two large prospective studies in US men and women   After multivariate adjustment for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, and modified Alternate Healthy Eating Index score, higher whole grain intake was associated with lower total and CVD mortality but not cancer mortality: the pooled HRs for quintiles 1 through 5, respectively, of whole grain intake were 1 (reference), 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95-1.02), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95-1.02), 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.01), and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) for total mortality (P fortrendâ<â.001); 1 (reference), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-1.01), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.87-1.01), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.94), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78-0.92) for CVD mortality (P fortrendâ<â.001); and 1 (reference), 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.08), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.99-1.12), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98-1.11), and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.91-1.04) for cancer mortality (P fortrendâ=â.43). We further estimated that every serving (28 g/d) of whole grain consumption was associated with a 5% (95% CI, 2%-7%) lower total morality or a 9% (95% CI, 4%-13%) lower CVD mortality, whereas the same intake level was nonsignificantly associated with lower cancer mortality (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94-1.02). Similar inverse associations were observed between bran intake and CVD mortality, with a pooled HR of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73-0.87; P fortrend < .001), whereas germ intake was not associated with CVD mortality after adjustment for bran intake."

It's DELICIOUS.  Something else that may be affecting your tastebuds is that sometimes we just come home with vegetables that aren't actually fresh or rinsed well. Fresh veggies will ALWAYS taste miles better than stuff that's been sitting out a day or two.  Last but way not least, is that after 5 months of pretty much only eating processed foods once a week maximum, vegetables taste way, way better to me.

This accomplishes several things:   Gives you a more accurate sense of how you eat in general and what you eat really adds up to. Helps you find comparatively more satiating foods. Helps you start to appreciate stuff like vegetables.   On that last point, non-starchy vegetables have very few calories per unit mass, so you can eat an incredible amount of them, even on a diet.  When you can eat literally anything, they're a harder sell to your brain, but when you're attempting to be as satiated as possible given calorie/macro guidelines, their value stands out.

Fruit is also extremely low in fat, unless you're talking about avocados. People who tell you that they don't eat fruit because it contains sugar need to get their facts straight.  What do long-term fruitarians all have in common? Are they all obese with diabetes and heart disease? No, they are slim, vibrant and extremely healthy.  How about primates (our closest relatives), do they calorie restrict their fruit intake to stop themselves from getting overweight? No, they eat all the fruit they care for.  Personally I eat 10-20 bananas and around 20 medjool dates every single day. I will also eat other fruits for between-meal snacks. This is all in addition to my other plant-based meals. I also run around 50km (30 miles) per week, fruit (carbohydrates) is the perfect source of energy for this sport.  The only thing you have to watch out for is eating fruit on top of other more slowly-digesting foods. Because fruit digests more quickly it can catch up to other food in your intestines and cause bloating, gas, etc. It's better to eat fruit meals earlier in the day and eat your cooked food later."

I agree with the comments regarding adding protein into your breakfast, and Iâd also suggest using this as a basic plan but aiming to vary your food choices daily, so you donât get bored and also to make sure youâre eating a range of foods to get all the nutrients you need.   Your exercise plan sounds good too â I think itâs really important to do things you enjoy so you feel good about getting healthier and naturally want to continue. Also, donât restrict yourself from eating certain foods, as youâll likely crave them more and find it harder to stick to. Aim to move towards a healthier lifestyle where you can incorporate those âtreatsâ into an overall healthy diet, so you can still enjoy them, just not as often."

It seems a bit low in calories for someone who weighs 118kg.  You might actually hurt your metabolism by going that low, as your body will go into starvation mode.  As /u/POGO_POGO_POGO_POGO suggested, /r/keto is a great way for a lot of people to lose weight and get healthy.  It'd be worth taking some time to learn about the keto lifestyle IMO."

As far as how to think, I agree with others that it takes time.  I'm currently working on a personal spreadsheet, wherein I input (inputted?) my favorite proteins, vegetables, and fats, and their macro makeups.

Totaling 371 Calories, 1 Fat, 53 Carbs, and 36 Protein. I would adjust the sweet potato serving amount to give way to a sauce for the chicken, however.  You'll become more familiar with the composition of foods... Need fat? Go for an avocado, nuts, legumes, cheese, fatty meat, eggs. Need Protein?

If it'll help you get to your macros, use it.  3) If you're taking care of your diet to have a good body composition, but you're not doing any resistance training, you're doing it wrong. 3 hours a week of hard lifting will do more for you than tracking macros even will. If you're not lifting, don't even bother tracking more than calories.  4) If you're having trouble hitting your protein goal, my advice is to make that a priority early in the day. Eat lots of chicken or tuna at lunch. It's a drag trying to eat pure protein at the end of the day. Just get it in early and have fun at night."

Having a diverse microbiome be consuming probiotics allows us to break down SCFA's more efficiently and lead to better gut health.  The gut has tight links to immunity and cancer so it is important to consume foods rich in probiotics.  Obesity can lead to unfavorable changes in the microbiome and a study has also shown that individuals consuming a high fat diet independent of obesity will also cause unfavorable changes (i'm looking at you /r/keto).

If you search for those keywords you'll return a number of studies. I was asking about the relationship between the administration of probiotic food products and microbial diversity, of which I'm skeptical.  I did a decent lit review on the subject of microbiota-obesity relationship. I had ~50 references and did a fairly thorough reading of half of those studies, and browsed through the other half (you know how it goes with reading literature).  I didn't see much on the effect of probiotic food products on measures of microbial diversity. A number of researchers have focused on the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut microbiota, and it would seem more likely that these foods, which are lactobacillus-heavy, would increase the relative abundance of Firmicutes. But in terms of diversity, I can't imagine why ingesting millions of organisms from three different species of bacteria would increase the diversity of the ecosystem. If anything, it would seem like it would lessen the diversity. But I would love to read those studies.  Personally, I'm waiting for the human-human fecal transplant research to come out. They've done it in the treatment of C.diff but haven't yet researched the effect on the microbiome at large or the effects on obesity, immunity, etc."

Dietary fibers are a type of carbohydrate that our body cannot metabolize, but many of our gut microbes (especially the beneficial ones) love the stuff, and because our own body passes up the energy locked in fiber, all of it is available to help nourish the little guys that keep us healthy.  In many ways, I would recommend increasing the fiber in one's diet well ahead of increasing intake of probiotic/fermented foods (although of course both are excellent), because nearly all of us already have the ""good"" microbes we want present, they're just not thriving as well as they could be. Fiber will help them thrive.  The best sources of dietary fiber are fresh, raw fruits and vegetables, beans, and whole grains (and whole grain products like bran, especially)."

If you're taking adderall for ADHD, there are quite a few people talking anecdotally about the keto diet relieving ADHD symptoms.  This may or may not be related to the fact that according to this study people with gluten sensitivity were 51% more likely to develop neurological disorders such as ADHD.  The GAPS diet, another grain-free low carb diet similar to the ketogenic diet, is being used by many practitioners to treat ADHD, Autism and other neurological disorders.  Use of probiotics has also been linked to the prevention and treatment of ADHD.    I'd highly recommend the book Grain Brain by Neurologist Dr. David Perlmutter.  In it he makes reference to ADHD several times.  In my opinion he's the foremost expert on nutrition as it relates to the brain, and is quite aware of the connection between gut bacteria and brain health.

For me, this excludes all commercial multivitamin/mineral and B-vitamin complexes. In general, I believe we should aim for nutritionally complete diets without supplementation (use a tool like Cron-o-meter), and supplement in moderation only those compounds we're likely to be deficient in. I do take nutritional supplements, but they're limited to those that aren't abundant my diet (B12, EPA, zinc, iodine).  Calcium supplementation competes with absorption of other divalent minerals (magnesium, zinc, some non-heme iron). Mark McCarty speculates that competition with magnesium absorption, rather than vascular calcification, may be the major issue with calcium suppplementation and cardiovascular risk:   McCarty MF. 2013. Cardiovascular risk linked to calcium supplementation might reflect decreased magnesium balance in people with low dietary magnesium"
nutrition,3aqipt,Sanpaku,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! Yea like I said I believe getting micro nutrients from diet is the best way to go, but there is no way I'd get close to even 50% of recommended daily value on many of these nutrients without supplementation. I have tracked my nutrients using Cron-o-meter before. That's why I want to take half of the recommended doses of all these vitamins, while still getting nutrients from whole foods. At a glance I'd be getting 83% DV Vitamin E, 42% DV Calcium, 33% DV Copper, and a little under 200% DV B2 Riboflavin. Is that Riboflavin excessive? It would be spaced out throughout the day."
nutrition,3aqipt,Sanpaku,2,Mon Jun 22 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"My concern with riboflavin is that a lot of people take high-potency B-complex supplements with 50-100 mg (4500-9000% DV for females) in the morning, and step out into the midday sun while that transient dose is still peaking in their plasma, which looks like a great way of accelerating skin photoaging and perhaps cancer risk."
nutrition,3aqipt,Sanpaku,2,Mon Jun 22 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"Also, you'd be surprised how well you can do with micronutrients in food. My most recent ""theoretical minimalist"" 2000 kcal diet I've played with on Cron-o-meter is just 10 medium potatoes, 4 cups bok choi, 1.5 oz almonds, 1 brazil nut, and a drop of sublingual B12, which pretty much covers the bases (potatoes are pretty close to nutritionally complete).  It required a bit a background knowledge: eg. no one has ever demonstrated a benefit to significantly more than 525 mg calcium in bone fracture incidence, so 700 mg is probably adequate; all the RDIs/DVs have a 20% fudge factor over median requirements, etc."
nutrition,3aqipt,dishpan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:20:09 2015 UTC,"Wow I didn't think potatoes had that many nutrients... Definitely going to add bok choi to my diet too. I used to eat brazil nuts but I can't find them at Walmart anymore, I'll have to look harder. May I ask what specific supplements you use for zinc and iodine? I assume you take fish oil for EPA, it is odd that fish oil doesn't contain iodine..  Even if I plan a perfect diet, I know myself too well to know most days I wouldn't follow it to a tee. It couldn't hurt if I took one multivitamin, fish oil, and calcium a day correct? Note most of the recommended doses on the boxes say 3-4 pills so I would only be getting a fraction of what is listed."

You'll have to bite the bullet and try one thing or another for at least a couple of months and see how it goes.  A good diet will benefit you in all sorts of ways, whether or not it fixes your GERD, so there's nothing to lose (other than the enjoyment of sweets, perhaps).  I'll give you my advice, but some others here will likely have a different opinion entirely.  Here goes:  I'd recommend a paleo or keto or better yet, keto-paleo diet myself.  If eating a lot of meat or fat caused acid reflux, then the Inuit would be in real trouble!  A low-carb high-fat diet can really help balance out hormones and all sorts of metabolic issues.   I'd also take supplemental probiotics, as I believe bacterial imbalances have been linked to GERD.  I'd also salt my food to taste - stomach acid is made of HCl, and the main source of Cl for your body is the chloride part of sodium-chloride (salt) so you'll need that for your body to make stomach acid properly and take a good multivitamin/multimineral, in case there are other aspects missing.  Make sure you've got some good sources for vitamin K in your diet, and your vitamin D levels are good (best to check with a blood test on this one).  Just my opinion.  Good luck."

I have never heard of a keto diet for GERD. most of the basic recommendations include eating small meals throughout the day (4-6), lower fat diet (limit fried foods), avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages, caution mint- it relaxes your lower esophageal sphincter which will lead to further heart burn, wait 1-2 hours before laying down after a meal, prob bed up if you have symptoms while sleeping. No actual specific diet otherwise...just eat balanced with fruits and veg and limiting any acidic ones that may exacerbate your issues.

If your resistance or cardio is intense, 1g/lb protein, .45g/lb fat and the rest of your TDEE in carbs.

nutrition,3apjr2,StuWard,2,Mon Jun 22 13:45:03 2015 UTC,"I find many problems with Mr. Lalonde's methodology. I can't go into all of them here, but here's the most relevant one for understanding why having bacon at the top of the list is misleading.  It's a bit nonsensical to to divide by weight. Weight or volume are not limiting factors in a diet, calories are. E.g. 100g of almonds is a meal; It provides ample calories and leaves you feeling full. Meanwhile 100g of apple isn't even an appetizer.   Lalonde thinks that nutritional and caloric densities should be considered separately. I'm sure there are circumstances where that is useful, but this is not one of them. When ranking foods according to how well they satisfy our nutritional requirements, taking calories into account is essential.  Now it's true that even the nutritional density w.r.t. calories increases when you render out the fat. Most of the nutrients are in the lean mass. But it isn't nearly enough of a change to put bacon on the top of the list."
nutrition,3apjr2,slampropp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"He does rank it by calories too.  Pork still ranks slightly higher than beef but falls behind legumes.  Bacon (pork, really) was never at the top of the list. It was always behind fish and organ meat along with nuts, seeds, herbs and spices.   In my opinion, the main problem with his methodolgy is the lack of consistant data, and how do you weight the different nutrients?"
nutrition,3apjr2,StuWard,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"He listed the calories to the side, but I didn't ever see him take it into account in the ranking. Are you referring to the ranking by ""caloric weight"", i.e. where the water and fibre weight was subtracted in the denominator? Because that's still not the same thing as comparing by calories, since the caloric density is different in different macronutrients.  I meant bacon was on the top of the list of meats, not top of the list over all. I should have been more clear. I don't think he ever showed the list of meats in particular, with his revised ""by caloric mass"" method, so who knows how the bacon fared there.  You bring up two very valid points. Spotty data is difficult to deal with, and treating a missing measurement as zero isn't valid. I've been doing these sorts of investigations myself, albeit with a much smaller data set. Data on certain nutrients, vitamin K for example, is so spotty that the only fair thing I could do was to altogether exclude K from consideration. That's not ideal either, but what can you do. (I'm not using USDA data, not sure if their coverage of K is better.)  The issue of weighting the nutrients is my biggest concern here. If I understood Lalonde right, each nutrient is scored by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. So what he's doing is to count standard deviations away from ""the average food"", per nutrient. That makes some assumptions. First of all, it assumes the nutrients are roughly normally distributed. Secondly it assumes that human nutritional requirements are roughly proportional to nutritional availability of nutrients. But I can't say if these are serious problems until I've studied his data."
nutrition,3apjr2,slampropp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:45:17 2015 UTC,"It's a bit nonsensical to to divide by weight.    Metric density is mass / volume.  English density is mass / weight.  If you're talking about nutrient ""density"" it makes sense.    Furthermore, the nutrients in most vegetables are so low, but the fact that they have so few calories artificially spike their rating.  If you're looking for a good source of protein, nobody sane is going to suggest eating kale unless you plan to eat multiple pounds of it, which you cannot do.  Also, who came up with the idea that the nutrients found in meat (e.g. B12, preformed vitamin A) shouldn't be included in the rating system (e.g. ANDI, NuVal)?  That's intentionally biasing the system."
nutrition,3apjr2,billsil,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"You make a valid point regarding density, if we're talking about adhering to the physics definition of it. But when we're talking about how much nutrients a food has, what we really want to know is whether a food is helpful for satisfying our nutritional requirements, within the limitations of how much we can/should eat. What those limitations are depends. Perhaps we need a new word other than density to describe this.  Regarding vegetables you are correct that weight is the most more relevant measure, and calculating by calories does indeed inflate their score. Ideally you'd take into account things like fibre, palatability, price, etc. But my judgement is that in general the most relevant factor of limitation is calories. Calories are also the most relevant in particular for ranking meats against each other.  Agree about bias when deciding which nutrients to consider."
nutrition,3apjr2,slampropp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Ideally you'd take into account things like fibre, palatability, price, etc.   No!  Those have no relevance to nutrient density.  If you want to plot nutrient density vs. calories or price or taste or whatever, fine, but they should not be included in the score.  That's a separate issue.  It makes sense to plot nutrient density vs. calories, nutrient density vs. fiber, and nutrients/cost vs. calories (which varies with the season and location).  I suspect if you were looking a nutrient/cost vs. calories, fruit scores would tank, and lentils would do very well.  Liver would probably still crush it, but spices would not (but they taste good).  Still, in terms of cost, Americans spend less than 10% of their budget on food, which is less than any other country.  What's even more sad is that's with eating out more.  I think 20% is reasonable (which is still low relative to historical norms).  http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/01/america-food-spending-less"

I typically do intermittent fasting (one meal per day with no snacks) and have for 3 years.  I don't gain or lose weight depending on how many meals I eat.  I also throw a 2-3 day fast in every two months or so.  I lose a bit of weight after that, but it comes right back.  It's very easy to maintain my ""baseline"" weight and hard to push it either way.  It's the same weight I was 15 years ago in high school.  Intermittent fasting is about forcing your body to efficiently burn fat and upregulate DNA repair enzymes.  Also, by intermittent fasting, I'm able to eat much better.  I cook all my meals from scratch and when I'm on travel in an airport and there's nothing I'm willing to eat, I just fast.  It's just not a big deal to go days without food.  You have fat, use it.  Another reason I fast is I don't believe we would have survived as a species if we required say 7 meals per day.

nutrition,3amlph,billsil,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"Intermittent fasting, on the other hand, decreases the body's expression of IGF-1. And it also appears to switch on a number of DNA repair genes. Restricted feeding, says Longo, makes our body go from ""growth mode"" to ""repair mode.""   http://io9.com/5979523/why-you-should-starve-yourself-a-little-bit-each-day   Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of Sirt1 on neuronal survival. Sirt1 exhibits broad deacetylase activity. Identified targets include: the tumor suppressor protein p53; the forkhead transcription factors (class O) FOXO; the DNA repair protein Ku70; the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³); and the nuclear factor NFÎºB (Mattson et al. 2003; Hisahara et al. 2005; Anekonda and Reddy 2006 Martin et al. 2006). Sirt1 represses p53-dependent apoptosis triggered by acute oxidative stress or DNA damage in fibroblasts and mesangial cells (Luo et al. 2001; Vaziri et al. 2001; Kume et al. 2006). To our knowledge, however, the importance of Sirt1-mediated p53 deacetylation has not been directly evaluated in neurons. Sirt1 also prevents FOXO3-mediated apoptosis. Mammalian FOXO factors regulate the transcription of various genes involved in resistance to stress, DNA repair and apoptosis (Furukawa-Hibi et al. 2005). In cerebellar granule cells, fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells, apoptosis triggered by FOXO3 acetylation in response to oxidative stress and DNA damage is inhibited by Sirt1 (Brunet et al. 2004; Motta et al. 2004). Sirt1 also inhibits apoptosis by deacetylating the DNA repair protein Ku70, causing it to sequester the proapoptotic factor Bax (Cohen et al. 2004).   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2649682/   In summary, CR has been shown to enhance various DNA repair mechanisms in normal tissues including HRR and NHEJ, which are essential for RT-induced DSB repair. In contrast, repair capacity in cancer cells may be left unaffected or even attenuated through CR. The differential stress resistance between normal and cancerous cells to chemotherapeutic drugs seems to be mediated at least in part by decreased glucose and free IGF-1 levels [47, 50]; it could therefore be speculated that the KD might achieve similar effects, although this would have to be investigated in future studies.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988521/   Since PCNA is both involved in DNA synthesis and repair, and since DNA synthesis is suppressed in the fasting intestine [7], these findings suggest that DNA repair mechanisms might be regulated.   Beta hydroxybuterate, which is a ketone body (the body makes this from fat to use for energy when you fast or eat a low carb/ketogenic diet (KD)) seems to be very important to the process of turning on ""good"" genes.  Also, there a hypothesis that caloric restriction doesn't matter and that the same effects of fasting on longevity also be achieved with methionine (an essential amino acid that we probably get too much of) restriction or alternatively glycine supplementation.  I care a lot about fasting.  It's been used throughout history to treat chronic disease and since I have 5...it's a big deal."

Is it a dietitian who suggested it or are you a dietitian?  I would also like to make a comparison not with eating too much (""7 meals per day"") but with eating 2 meals per day, and 2-3 small snacks (fruit, yoghurt). Also what do you mean with the word ""meal""? One portion of food?  I used to have eating disorder (still recovering as becoming completely healthy again is difficult). I used to fast at breakfast (just one mug of milk), no snacks allowed, 2 meals per day maximum. It's about 11 years I always weight 110-113 pounds (I am about 5'5'' tall). I look pretty young for my age compared to people of similar age. But my calories intake was really too low.  It's one year that I have started to have regular breakfast and increase my meal intake. And no more fasting allowed (which for me means no days without at least 3 meals, one at breakfast, one at lunch and one at dinner). I just took 2 kilos since I have started one year ago.

nutrition,3amlph,ilyemco,2,Mon Jun 22 06:24:17 2015 UTC,"I don't get headaches or a bad mood.  I actually feel much more mentally sharp.  If you eat a high carb diet and never burn fat as your primary fuel source, it's very difficult to burn fat and you'll take 3 days to (poorly, but somewhat) adjust.  I eat ~15-20% carb so fat is my primary fuel source.  I usually (~5/7 days of the week) eat one meal per day, so I'm already very used to burning ketones most of the day.  I'll typically start my fast on Friday (last meal was on Thursday), not eat Friday and Saturday.  Then depending I'll fast through Sunday or Monday and then eat.  It depends.  I'll break it if I'm hungry.  I'm not a dietitian; just an 32 year old aerospace engineer that has far too many chronic diseases and drastically improved my health through dietary experimentation.  I was 5'10"" and 115 pounds for 2.5 years.  I fixed it 3 years ago (I'm 145 now).  I started fasting because I wasn't hungry, it saved time, so I could work through lunch, go home early, and cook the meal I wanted to eat.  It just slowly progressed.   I would also like to make a comparison not with eating too much   Eating too much is 1) you're gaining unwanted weight or 2) you carb crash after a meal 3) you get too full.  Getting fat is bad, but so is getting sleepy or cranky because you haven't eaten (caused by low blood sugar).  You'd be surprised at how much you can stuff down your throat and not get full if you haven't eaten in a day.  Fullness has a lot to do with what ate (or didn't eat) at breakfast and lunch.  If you're going to snack 7 times per day, do you brush your teeth afterwards?  I just don't see the value (unless maybe you're diabetic, but that's a whole different subject).  Burning fat for energy liberates you from hunger that is largely driven by excessive carbohydrate intake.  If you haven't tried it, it's so hard to see it.   is not ""natural"" as you say?   We are one of the fattest mammal on the planet.  We evolved with periods of abundance and periods of famine and we burned fat to survive.  Throughout recorded history, people have regularly fasted as part of their religious practices.  It's only recently that people have really stopped.  We know it's good for us."

Some of the most classic Japanese dishes like ramen and katsu are pure fat. Even sushi is very carb-heavy.  So what's the difference with the West? I think one big difference is there's a bit more restraint in Japan, with people being very conscious about eating healthy food regularly, instead of nearly every day. People also move around quite a lot, because depending on where you are, cars just aren't that convenient. Public transport is also extremely good in Japan, meaning it's usually more convenient than using a car, especially when compared to the car country that is the US.  Most importantly is probably that portions aren't as big as they might be in the US or in Europe. And people snack far less, based on what I've seen and heard. At most people grab a drink from the vending machine, but many of those are low in sugar. (Japanese vending machines feature stuff like unsweetened tea.)

Alternatively, your weight can stay the same on a high carb or high fat diet (e.g. 15% carb, 65% fat, 20% protein like myself).  On the other hand, refined carbohydrates (e.g. white bread, white rice, soda) are literally addictive.  They also lead to being hungry when you don't really need food, which causes you to eat more.   The findings, published last week in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, imply that the quick spike and subsequent crash in blood sugar that comes after eating highly processed carbs activates reward and addiction centers in the brain.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/refined-carbohydrates-can-trigger-food-cravings-study-says/2013/07/01/0d501c64-e012-11e2-963a-72d740e88c12_story.html  The problem is people that eat more meat tend to not eat fruits and non-starchy veggies.  You can literally eat 2 pounds of non-starchy veggies per day and only eat 15% of your calories from carbs (I do).  Most people that eat meat don't even eat veggies (but they do drink soda), so is it the meat, or the junk?"

Westerners are so sedentary in their lifestyles that it is no wonder they get fat.  Eat too much food, sit at your job, sit at home, don't go outside with the kids, it's bound to happen.  Refined shit also doesn't have the full fiber in it, which is what helps you feel fuller longer so you are less likely to eat more."
nutrition,3alhm4,SpaceJockey1979,5,Mon Jun 22 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think weight is probably 75% diet, 10% sleep quality, 10% stress level, and 5% exercise.  You can't outrun a bad diet.  Even professional athletes that eat too much sugar end up with high blood pressure and high fasting blood glucose even thought they're 5% body fat.  A big mac is 560 calories.  You can't exercise that away (at least in a day), but it's easy to never eat it in the first place.  It's easy to never walk down the junk food aisles or go to a restaurant.  I have a BMI of 20.5 and I don't count calories and I don't have magic willpower.  I just count crap.  The thing about calories in-out is if you're off by say 100 calories per day consistently, you'll gain/lose 10.5 pounds per year.  Since most people maintain some weight (maybe higher than they want) easily even without counting calories despite wildly different food intakes or exercise level, it really suggests that the body is incredibly good at determining exactly how much it needs.  It's only when you mess with hormones (mainly through diet) that things fall apart.    I put on 30 pounds in 3 months in college because I ate fried food and lots of soda.  I was just always hungry.  I lost it effortlessly when I consciously started eating (slightly) better.  It's legitimately harder for some people, but you're stacking the deck against yourself by eating processed foods."

I mean, I know potatoes won't kill me, but the thing is I try to eat low carb because I have RA and other issues with inflammation and I generally want to be healthy. It's the mix of potatoes + meat that I'm wondering if it's ok. Like does eating a potato cancel out the zero carb meat-only benefits and then make it unhealthy? I know that's a weird question, maybe it's not possible to answer, but that's what I'm worried about partially. I mean, I suppose if I feel good, and a potato is only like 30 carbs a day (plus sour cream I guess, but whatever) and isn't eaten all the time...I'd still be in ketosis fully. So I suppose it isn't that bad :/  But wow, this dude was committed. I'm sure some of his ""health improvements"" were just because he was eating the SAD though.

nutrition,3am7w9,plantpistol,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:07:29 2015 UTC,If you are going low-carb then potatoes probably would not be on the list. Although if you eat the skin of the potato along with the inside then I believe you get pretty much all the nutrients you need. What has your diet been like over the years that it has been getting worse?
nutrition,3am7w9,NotAnIsland,2,Mon Jun 22 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"Although if you eat the skin of the potato along with the inside then I believe you get pretty much all the nutrients you need   The skin of white potatoes contains solanine:   It can occur naturally in the any part of the plant, including the leaves, fruit, and tubers. It is very toxic even in small quantities.   Solanine has both fungicidal and pesticidal properties, and it is one of the plant's natural defenses.  Potatoes naturally produce solanine and chaconine, a related glycoalkaloid, as a defense mechanism against insects, disease, and predators. Potato leaves and stems are naturally high in glycoalkaloids.  Commercial varieties of potatoes are screened for solanine levels, and most have a solanine content of less than 0.2mg/g. However potatoes that have been exposed to light and started to green (see greening) can show concentrations of 1 mg/g or more. In these situations a single unpeeled potato can result in a dangerous dose.  Solanine poisoning is primarily displayed by gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach cramps, burning of the throat, headaches and dizziness.  Hallucinations, loss of sensation, and paralysis, fever, jaundice, dilated pupils and hypothermia have been reported in more severe cases. In large quantities, solanine poisoning can cause death. One study suggests that doses of 2 to 5 mg per kilogram of body weight can cause toxic symptoms, and doses of 3 to 6 mg per kilogram of body weight can be fatal.  Symptoms usually occur 8 to 12 hours after ingestion, but may occur as rapidly as 30 minutes after eating high-solanine foods.   Most solanine occurs in the skin or just under the skin of potatoes. Peeled potatoes have been found to contain 30-80% less solanine than unpeeled potatoes, and green potatoes should always be peeled if they are to be used at all. Solanine and chaconine are also present in potato shoots.  Deep-frying potatoes at 170 Â°C is effective at lowering glycoalkaloid levels, boiling is ineffective, and microwaving only somewhat effective  http://www.food-info.net/uk/qa/qa-fp95.htm   More on solanine in white potatoes + their treatment to prevent sprouting:   Since solanine is water insoluble, heat stable, and concentrated in the potato skin, the green discolored flesh just below the skin could contain the greatest amount of solanine and should be discarded.  Among solanceous plants, the potato tuber has the unique capacity to trigger postharvest glycoalkaloid synthesis in response to light induction.  However, harvested potatoes routinely are treated to inhibit sprouting. Potato growers, packers, and commercial use have built safeguards into their procedures to prevent problems that might occur. The potential concern about potato sprouts and greening potatoes is probably known to many home gardeners as well  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/plantox/detail.cfm?id=6537   My own anecdotal n=1 experiment: I ate for a some days white potatoes with skin, and soon every morning I was getting nausea. These store bought white potatoes had still some earth on them, so that I was absolutely sure that their skin had not been treated post-harvest in a chemically way to prevent sprouting. This morning nausea could not have come from anti-sprouting chemicals on the potato skin and the nausea disappeared as soon as I stopped eating the skin of those white potatoes."

I would be too paranoid about the huge amount of carbs I would be eating.  I don't think I ever had a terrible diet, but as a little kid I did used to eat a lot of chocolate and cookies like other kids. I never liked fruit flavored candy or anything, just plain chocolate or vanilla bars, cookies, or ice cream. I would eat bread and cereal. Usually I would eat bread for toast at breakfast, or a piece of bread with dinner, or bread for grilled cheese. I wasn't really restricting anything except for nuts as I knew I was allergic. My dinners were usually a meat, a vegetable, and a side of pasta or something with carbs (like a potato). I never avoided fruit, as I have always just really loved fruit.   Then many years ago I learned I was allergic to corn and wheat, so I did a gluten free and corn free diet (and soy free because of intolerances). I still ate grains like rice and quinoa and didn't seem to have an issue. I would eat cookies and sweets sometimes that were gluten/corn/nut/soy free. I would eat ice cream sometimes as well, but I definitely ate way less of this than before. I ate bread rarely, like I would have a few slices of a special cinnamon raisin toast in the morning, but did not eat it throughout the day. Over time I just stopped eating chocolate and sweets and most processed foods because I wanted to be healthier and they were making my vesicular eczema worse. So for a long time I had been eating mostly whole foods (with rice noodles very occasionally).   I had always had a lot of stomach pain in general but through eating like that it seemed to get better. Then it just got worse again. I started getting really bad gas from things like apples. Not gas as in farting, but gas as in it would build up and cause really bad pain to where I couldn't move. Things that had never specifically caused a problem started getting much worse. I've always had my lower abdomen kind of jut out whereas in my family for everyone else it is flat and they don't have my issues either. When I eat only meat it gets flatter but still not to a normal point. And now some meats are bothering me too...I just ate pork which has never bothered me and now I have stomach cramps :/ I think perhaps maybe it is just IBS.

nutrition,3ajxia,Sample12345,2,Sat Jun 20 22:47:15 2015 UTC,"After your body separates protein from food and breaks it down into aminos and peptides it can utilize, there are carrier proteins that transport them from the small intestine to the liver and beyond.  You have a set amount of these so there's a maximum rate at which you can move protein to be utilized.  As with most biological things different people have different amounts of these, and can move protein at different rates. Unfortunately, there's very limited research in this area and I haven't been able to find a bound for these rates.  It's likely high enough you utilize most of what you eat.  Let's say 60g of protein of steak takes 6 hours to fully digest.  That's just 10g per hour which most people can probably handle. However, 60g of protein from a protein shake go through you in maybe 2 hours because no separation and breakdown are necessary and it's already in liquid form. That's 30g per hour which might outpace your delivery of protein carriers to the small intestine and thus waste a lot more of what you eat (but like I said real numbers are unknown due to limited research). In the protein shake example, the protein will also hit the liver in much higher doses at once which might cause problems (as it did for me), and then the biproducts hit the kidneys in higher amounts which might also cause problems."

nutrition,3ajxia,sol_aries,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:58:44 2015 UTC,"No, AA supplements cannot increase how much you absorb.  I'll back up a bit.  You eat protein in some form (steak, beans, protein powder, etc).  Then the stomach separates the protein from the food it came from.  Then the small intestine breaks down the protein into amino acids and peptides.  Then those amino acids and peptides are absorbed from your small intestine and taken to your bloodstream (and thus the liver) by a carrier transport system.  This protein carrier transport system has a maximum rate at which it can do its job but we do not have a good idea of what a good average rate is.  The carrier transport system is composed mainly of protein themselves that cells in the intestines produce, but the amount is finite so there has to be a maximum rate.  There are 7 types of carrier proteins, each one specializing in moving a different amino acid or peptide into your bloodstream to reach your liver and beyond.  There are single amino acids that don't have a carrier protein associated with them so they cannot be absorbed on their own and must be absorbed as part of a peptide (either a di- or tri-peptide).  On this basis I question the efficacy of Amino Acid supplements as opposed to whole protein supplements like Whey or meat."

It has to do with the fact the body can't store protein (other than in the form of muscle, which is a lousy fuel source).  However, the body can make use of it if you say eat one meal per day because it needs to repair more things.  Also, that means you're starving, because if you don't have an glycogen, your body goes after it's fat reserves.  Gluconeogenesis makes up a trivial amount of calories (~120 calories per day) during fasting or ketogenesis.  It's only until you have very little body fat (e.g. less than 5%) that protein becomes a relevant fuel source, which is also called starvation.

nutrition,3ad0tv,billsil,5,Fri Jun 19 06:10:04 2015 UTC,"The question was about civilization (ie, cities/states).  The ""animal products"" phrase is because gout is attested to in Sumerian medical tablets and Egyptian skeletal remains, and its the classic disease of excess (high purine intake, mostly from meat).   The loss of functional urate oxidase in humans, other great apes and gibbons (but not more distant primates like baboons) is one clue that our common ancestors have consumed low purine (mostly vegetarian) diets for at least 25 million years. Members of Hominoidea are susceptible to gout when eating highly carnivorous diets.  The milk and blood consumed almost exclusively by young Masai males (though not so much other Masai) has little DNA from nucleated cells, and hence is low in gout-causing purine. Masai do develop a form of atherosclerosis, but it's likely that the limited period that the men consume the milk and blood diet, high physical activity, intestinal parasites, and cholesterol metabolism adaptations to millenia of this diet protect them from the consequences."
nutrition,3ad0tv,Sanpaku,4,Fri Jun 19 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it's specifically the build up of uric acid that's causing the gout, not necessarily consuming purines themselves.   A properly functioning body should be able to deal with the purines consumed.  What I'm getting at is that the science isn't 100% exact in that there is a causal relationship between purine consumption alone and gout.   There is enough evidence and mechanistic explanations as to why alcohol and sugar (specifically excess fructose) could very well be the cause, in that they disrupt the body's ability to deal with the purines.   So it's possible that high purine consumption is only an issue if combined with a high sugar and alcohol diet - two things of which the rich of any civilization would have ample access to."
nutrition,3ad0tv,crab_shak,4,Fri Jun 19 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"The ""animal products"" phrase is because gout is attested to in Sumerian medical tablets and Egyptian skeletal remains, and its the classic disease of excess (high purine intake, mostly from meat)   Blaming meat for containing purines and worsening gout is like blaming all carbohydrates for contributing to diabetes (gout and diabetes are highly related).  Diabetes is a disease state that has all sorts of complications (renal failure, poor blood sugar management, dramatically increased risk of heart disease & cancer).  It's a disease state and as such is an abnormal state for the body to be in.  You say we should watch our purine intake.  Should we watch our carbohydrate intake?  Vegetarians typically eat upwards of 55%+ carbohydrates, which is known to raise triglycerides (fat in the blood), which increases your risk of heart disease and diabetes.  The body handles protein, salt, carbohydrates, fat, etc. just fine if you're not sick.  The body also handles dietary cholesterol just fine (hence the new dietary guidelines).   The loss of functional urate oxidase in humans, other great apes and gibbons (but not more distant primates like baboons) is one clue that our common ancestors have consumed low purine (mostly vegetarian) diets for at least 25 million years. Members of Hominoidea are susceptible to gout when eating highly carnivorous diets.   This includes Neanderthals which did eat a highly carnivorous diet and we are only 200,000 years removed from (not 25 million).  This includes the traditional Inuit diet, which is a highly carnivorous diet.  It's only when the Inuit eat a diet high in refined carbohydrates (something you, I, and they clearly did not evolve to eat) that they end up with heart disease.  Campbell and Esslysten's diets (10% fat, vegan diet) also cut out all refined foods, even ones that are low fat (including bread, white rice, and pixie sticks).  Humans are not vegetarians.  We're omnivores and can thrive on a wide range of diets.   and cholesterol metabolism adaptations to millenia of this diet protect them from the consequences   Yet they get heart disease when they eat refined carbohydrates.  Yes, it's possible that their cholesterol is lower (due to their high saturated fat intake) than if you or I ate that way, but they still get heart disease if they eat refined foods.  Speaking of the Egyptians, bread and honey was a very popular food among the royalty.  So I agree, diabetes and gout are clearly diseases of excess, but I think refined sugar is to blame.   The Relationship of Sugar to Population-Level Diabetes Prevalence  We found that obesity appeared to exacerbate, but not confound, the impact of sugar availability on diabetes prevalence, strengthening the argument for targeted public health approaches to excessive sugar consumption. We also noted that longer exposure to high sugar was associated with accentuated diabetes prevalence, while reduced sugar exposure was associated with decline in diabetes prevalence, and that the sugar-diabetes relationship appeared to meet criteria for temporal causality without being the result of selection biases or the effect of secular trends that may be artifacts of economic development or changes in surveillance.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584048/  Here's a bit on sugar and gout   Conclusions Prospective data suggest that consumption of sugar sweetened soft drinks and fructose is strongly associated with an increased risk of gout in men. Furthermore, fructose rich fruits and fruit juices may also increase the risk. Diet soft drinks were not associated with the risk of gout."

An American paradox  What are the effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in comparison with those of a higher-fat, lower-carbohydrate diet? The response differs by the 2 main types of hyperlipidemia: simple hypercholesterolemia and combined hyperlipidemia. In our studies of simple hypercholesterolemia in men, a fat intake <25% of energy and a carbohydrate intake >60% of energy was associated with a sustained increase in triacylglycerol of 40%, a decrease in HDL cholesterol of 3.5%, and no further decrease in LDL in comparison with higher fat intakes (5). In contrast, a low-fat diet in persons with combined hyperlipidemia caused no worsening of triacylglycerol or HDL, but intakes of fat >40% of energy and of carbohydrate <45% of energy for 2 y were associated with a lower triacylglycerol concentration at a stable weight (6). In the subjects of Mozaffarian et al, a greater saturated fat intake paralleled a total fat intake, which ranged from 18% to 32% of energy in the first to fourth quartiles. Modest favorable trends in triacylglycerol and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were observed with higher fat intakes.  These effects include the paradox that a high-fat, highâsaturated fat diet is associated with diminished coronary artery disease progression in women with the metabolic syndrome, a condition that is epidemic in the United States.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/5/1102.full  Also, the Atkins, Zone, LEARN (basically the standard recommendation/DASH diet), and Ornish diet were tested, Atkins did the best (basically just varying the macronutrient intake).  Furthermore, the lead researcher was a vegetarian making it all the more compelling.  He's a very smart guy and has more than few ideas about nutrition that I think are spot on (and I'm obviously not a vegetarian though I don't eat refined foods).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eREuZEdMAVo"
nutrition,3ad0tv,billsil,2,Fri Jun 19 18:46:34 2015 UTC,"Right, but the type of saturated fat matters too.  IE from a grain fed cow vs a coconut.  This explains the reason that certain trials on the effects of saturated fat measure a positive effect while others measure a negative effect; it being saturated fat or not doesn't as matter as much as other lipid factors."
nutrition,3ad0tv,djdadi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"It's one possibility.  The other is people don't keep good food journals or possibly do a survey once a year (that definitely happens) leading to huge error in the data sets.  I think you're right about the source (e.g. grain vs. grass fed), but I think that's a secondary effect.  The A-Z trial did not include a bit on organic/grass fed/etc. component as far as I know, nor did the lead researcher discuss that aspect in his talk and he talked about a lot of different theories as to what was going on.    People don't by default seek out grass fed, so when a trial conducted in the US puts people on a diet, if they're including chicken/pork/beef, you can expect it's from corn fed animals.  I think saturated fat is neutral.  It's a source of calories and not very many nutrients (kinda like carbohydrates) and not much more."

With running, my goal was obviously not to look better. I was actually well aware of the possibility of me having an unwanted loss of mass. The reason for me to run is for the short-term euphoria I am very hooked to now, and the long-term psychological effects I read so much about. As for eating healthy, it was something I considered a must-have if I ever go on a vegan diet, as otherwise my diet will be mostly rice and potatos.  I never wanted to get into that body-building gym thing, I am actually very pleased with my body.

nutrition,3aeob6,ciabattabing16,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"Vegan diets are quite healthy, but you have to remember that by eating whole foods, you're not getting the caloric intake you may need by exercising so much and at your age.  You can eat a giant bowl of broccoli and absolutely stuff yourself and you've only consumed a few hundred calories.  The density on whole foods is WAY lower than non-vegan and especially just general consumer unhealthy or processed stuff.  So, a couple of tips from a vegan:   Eat some more whole grain pasta a few hours before your workout.  Get those carbs in so that your body has something to use on your runs, if you want to keep running.  Eat more beans.  There's a LOT of variety of foods you can have.  Pinto, black, lentils, chickpeas...you can cook these really quickly, or you can get the canned version and simply throw them on a plate with some rice and veggies for a very quick meal. Eat more.  Make sure you're having a big full breakfast, lunch, and dinner (or whatever meal schedule you like).  Don't force-feed, eat when you're hungry.  But also try to eat right before or after exercise and activities. Do some bodyweight or freeweight exercises.  Pushups, decline pushups, squats, pistols, pullups, curls, planks....these are things you can do with little to no equipment, or very cheap equipment, and will help tone your body and put a bit of muscle mass on your frame.  Guy or girl, won't matter.  You won't accidentally get huge, that's an unrealistic fear if it is one for you at all.  Get some food in around the workouts, and you can supplement yourself a bit with a simple protein shake.  You can get vegan protein powder online or in health stores and mix it with soymilk or make a fruit smoothie, stuff like that.  The idea being you want to get some stuff in you to give your body a better chance at packing on some muscle."

nutrition,3ae0i5,StuWard,2,Fri Jun 19 11:54:59 2015 UTC,"Fermentation in food processing:       Fermentation in food processing is the conversion of carbohydrates to alcohols and carbon dioxide or organic acids using yeasts, bacteria, or a combination thereof, under anaerobic conditions. Fermentation usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desirable. The science of fermentation is also known as zymology or zymurgy.  The term ""fermentation"" is sometimes used to specifically refer to the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol, a process which is used to produce alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer, and cider. Fermentation is also employed in the leavening of bread (CO2 produced by yeast activity); in preservation techniques to produce lactic acid in sour foods such as sauerkraut, dry sausages, kimchi, and yogurt; and in pickling of foods with vinegar (acetic acid).  Natural fermentation precedes human history. Since ancient times, however, humans have been controlling the fermentation process. The earliest evidence of an alcoholic beverage, made from fruit, rice, and honey, dates from 7000â6600 BCE, in the Neolithic Chinese village of Jiahu,  and winemaking dates from 6000 BCE, in Georgia, in the Caucasus area.  Seven-thousand-year-old jars containing the remains of wine, now on display at the University of Pennsylvania, were excavated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.   There is strong evidence that people were fermenting beverages in Babylon circa 3000 BC,  ancient Egypt circa 3150 BC,  pre-Hispanic Mexico circa 2000 BC,  and Sudan circa 1500 BC.

(Â¹) There is another article from 2015, but it is only general thoughts:    http://www.shape.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-strategies/mono-meal-plan-one-fad-diet-you-shouldnt-follow   (Â²) Very notorious is the eat ""3.000 calories a day"" rule, based on ... nothing. Nobody can tell you!  (Â³) more food for thought: bloggers Paul and Julia Tarbath wrote in one of their recent newsletters (July 2015) a critique on the Raw Till 4 Diet:    It is not that we are against the raw till 4 lifestyle â it certainly is healthier than most diets out there, including many vegan ones, however there are some problems that we would like to talk about.  They are the kinds of problems that can lead people to gaining unnecessary weight, having cravings, as well as experiencing bloating and possible digestive issues.   So let's go through them ...  Number 1: The fear of fat.  Yes, too much fat is bad for you. But that doesnât mean that you need to avoid all fat, especially the healthy fats you get in avocado or coconut flesh. The world fittest people â elite Kenyan runners and the Tarahumarans in Mexico consume between 9-13% fat in their diets.  Most people transition into a Raw Til 4 diet from standard, fat laden food plans, so going on a lifestyle that exclude all fats may lead to them being less satiated. For as long as you consume fats in healthy amounts and keep your fat at around 10% of your total daily calories, then there is absolutely no problem with adding them to your food plan.  Number 2: Calories.  Iâve made lots of videos about it and talked about why people gain weight on a high-carb vegan plan due to eating too many calories. Just google for raw til 4 weight gain stories and you will see people sharing their experiences. Eating more than your body needs can lead to unwanted weight gain, even if you eat fruit or starch. So we always recommend you eating according to your bodily needs and not ""stuffing"" yourself with the extra calories your body does not need.   Number 3: Water.  Do you feel bloated on the raw till 4 plan? This could be due to you drinking too much water. The recommended water intake is 3 liters. However, most people will not need to drink this much water. The best way to determine how much water you need to drink is to drink according to your thirst. If you are thirsty â drink more. If your urine is dark in colour, you need to increase your water intake. If your urine is light in colour or clear â you are hydrated.  Number 4: Healing.  A lot of people come into a vegan diet because they want to heal themselves. However, a diet of fruit, grain and beans may not be suitable for people healing digestive or other disorders, so it is important for people to know that they may need to eat differently and choose a food plan such as a low-fat raw vegan one or a low-fat, high raw vegan plan that excludes grains and beans."

All in one day is more fun IMO.  The fact you're even considering all drinks in one day means you like to have a good time and drink a decent amount.  If you try to limit yourself to one drink per day then come the weekend you'll probabaly end up drinking more than one beer anyways since that is who you are.  Maybe not the first weekend but the second third or fourth...  I've met a lot of different types of people and the ones that don't drink at all are the ones that are used to not drinking at all.  It's just the way they learned to do things.  It doesn't mean you can't get lean while drinking alcohol still as long as your macros are in check.

If poop + undigested smoothie comes out, then you have something really weird going on."
nutrition,3ab4ev,djdadi,9,Thu Jun 18 20:01:09 2015 UTC,"No one has mentioned it, so I'll take a stab.   BLACKBERRIES. Blackberries, while delicious, contain a large amount of sorbitol. This is the same sugar that gives prunes their famous laxative effect. You may be especially sensitive.   My guess is that the large consumption of sorbitol and liquid is initiating your bowel to empty. Does this reaction happen with any other foods? You also likely have IBS, as this is a common problem. Avoiding your trigger foods (likely blackberries in this case), can control the symptoms.   I'd suggest making your smoothie without blackberries - to test the theory.   EDIT: Another possible trigger could be the almond milk. Almonds have a large dose of galacto-oligosaccharides. If the blackberry elimination doesn't work, consider subbing out the almond milk for something like rice milk or coconut milk (not coconut water).   Keep in mind that you may need to give your gut time to heal in order to accurately test."

I'm inclined to believe that denying your body the nutrients it needs is what does the harm found by these studies moreso than an over-consumption of a confounding scapegoat like meat.

There is such thing as the limiting amino acid--the amino acid in your body that is at the lowest concentration.

A lot of layman websites say it's much better for digestion and nutrient absorption if you chew everything into a pulp, to be honest, I think the crux of the matter is that you probably should chew your food more and eat slower, helps to focus you on what you're eating and enjoy the taste for longer, but that it likely won't be the cause of your issues.

Unfortunately I don't have any more info about that.  As for acne, I read the comments here. Biologically speaking, ejaculating by masturbation or sex can help acne disappear, not make it worse."

I've heard of people drinking water mixed with chia seeds before a meal because it makes them feel full. Chia seeds aren't really that cheap... Even when you buy them from the bulk section of a store they are quite expensive. I love chia seed pudding and sprinkling them on pb and banana toast and chia seeds on granola... I really like them. But at the end of the day they are just a seed that absorbs a lot of water and has some good vitamins and fats. I don't think you will lose muscle mass by eating them."

You need to break down whats on the body and use it for energy in order to function. So the body turns to fat stored on the body and muscle to use for energy. So not only is he not gaining muscle. He is most likely losing muscle at a very slow rate.   I have no idea what ""maximum"" you are talking about. Theres no set maximum number of protein you can eat.

Studies show MOST people cant use more than 1g/lb efficiently, but those same studies showed some individuals could use well above the 1g/lb mark. So that maximum is most certainly a generality.   Also, many people eat more than 1g/lb because they simply want to eat more food while dieting that the body will have an extremely hard time turning to fat."

Its really not that bad once you get into the swing of things. When ordering food at a restaurant, dont count on the people cooking it to really care about the accuracy of their listed macros. Ask them to cook it in no oil/butter.   Your body goes through a phase when you start dieting sometimes where it needs a bit of time to catch up so to speak. Id give it another week or two honestly.  You could have some metabolic damage if you werent concerned with your diet much previous to this. This can be fixed by adding more carbs.  Those carbs are LOW AS HELL for someone 250lbs. I would be eating more carbs than that if I were you. In my experience, dropping carbs that low for someone with your height/weight results in the body trying to hold onto everything it can. Carbs fuel the furnace.   What exactly made you choose to run your fats higher and carbs that low?

nutrition,3a8hgj,billsil,2,Thu Jun 18 07:30:30 2015 UTC,"No.  Calories in-out are all that matter in terms of your weight gain/loss.  However, the kind of food you eat drives hunger and satiety hormones that can lead to a very rapid rise and subsequent crash leading you to feel you need some quick sugar.  Low blood sugar also drives hunger, but since you just ate, you don't need more food.  Furthermore, the type of food you eat beyond, blood sugar issues, makes you more or less likely to eat   I first met Moskowitz on a crisp day in the spring of 2010 at the Harvard Club in Midtown Manhattan. As we talked, he made clear that while he has worked on numerous projects aimed at creating more healthful foods and insists the industry could be doing far more to curb obesity, he had no qualms about his own pioneering work on discovering what industry insiders now regularly refer to as âthe bliss pointâ or any of the other systems that helped food companies create the greatest amount of crave.   The biggest hits â be they Coca-Cola or Doritos â owe their success to complex formulas that pique the taste buds enough to be alluring but donât have a distinct, overriding single flavor that tells the brain to stop eating.  This is the way a product interacts with the mouth, as defined more specifically by a host of related sensations, from dryness to gumminess to moisture release. These are terms more familiar to sommeliers, but the mouth feel of soda and many other food items, especially those high in fat, is second only to the bliss point in its ability to predict how much craving a product will induce.   http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html  Salt, sugar, and fat in certain combinations make foods very difficult to resist.  These foods are overwhelmingly junk food.  Food companies know exactly what they are doing and exactly how to make you literally addicted.  Salt, sugar, and fat are all dirt cheap (hence the huge portion sizes) and they make a ton of money off you by selling you it.  Coca Cola makes more money selling you a large soda for a $1.50 than a small for $1.40.   In other words, it appears junk food-fed rats donât seem to realize when theyâve overindulged in a food (the flavored sugar water); instead, they respond to the sound cues just the same, whereas healthy rats stop responding to the food they just ate.  In another experiment, the researchers wanted to see whether the apparent disruption of the reward mechanism persisted after the junk food-fed rats were placed on a healthy diet. Even after a week on healthy rat chow, the formerly junk food-fed rats still acted the same way, treating both solutions indiscriminately, according to Morris.   http://www.newsweek.com/junk-food-addictive-avoid-trying-new-foods-266803"

You cannot eat a diet high in refined sugar and fried food and expect to be healthy and you probably wouldn't even notice it unless you quit for a month before going back on your old diet.  A sweet potato has the vast majority of it's calories coming from carbs, but your blood sugar won't crash from them because it's absorbed slower due the fiber.  You then don't come down hard.  I usually eat one meal per day.  Try it.  If your carb intake is too high, you will crash so hard, feel terrible and probably fall asleep afterwards.  It forces you to learn the effects of food on your body.  They're very consistent, but some of the effects take longer than others (e.g. 24 hours).  The food you eat can give you BO or not, affects your mental sharpness in the morning, affects your mood, the way you manage stress, your personality.  There's a lot we don't know, but a lot we do."

All of your points are legitimate, though I'd argue that they aren't nearly as important as most people would think in the big scheme of things. In my opinion diet comes down to (in order of importance) adherence, calories, macros, and then everything else. Staying away from refined carbs and whatnot will be very useful if there's an adherence problem, but the OP didn't make it sound like there was. Anyway, we're just arguing semantics here.

Protein - chicken breast, steak, pork, mince  Veg - at least 1 dark green veg like kale, spinach, broc. Then others like capsicums, carrots, courgette etc.  Fat - might come from the meat, or cheese, avocado, eggs or fish like salmon.  So a typical dinner might be brown rice with a kale salad and grilled chicken breast with spices. Once you get the hang of some basic cooking skills and the building blocks, you'll find your weekly shops also revolve around having these ingredients for meals. Good to keep it regular.  I think the key is also working with what you like to eat so it doesn't feel like a chore.

Most of the sucralose we consume is excreted as waste - while another 11% to 27% of it gets absorbed into the bloodstream through the gastrointestinal tract, removed from the blood by the kidneys, and eliminated through our urine.  The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for sucralose is 5 mg/kg bodyweight per day, but the typical personâs estimated daily intake is a significantly lower 1.6 mg/kg per day. Human trials havenât reported any significant dangerous effects for sucralose at all - but similarly to studies on aspartame, some research has found a relationship between sucralose intake and migraine headaches.  http://examine.com/blog/artificial-sweeteners-is-the-evidence-as-sweet-as-these-substitutes/"

First things first though the other comment in here is a butthurt or crazed person who is taking soylent as a full food replacement which if that is your plan don't do it because that's not what it is INTENDED use for average people is.   Second if you do not plan to use it for total replacement than congrats you should still be interested in soylent. If you are looking into it for economical reasons bad again after my cost estimates to get enough calories it was very inefficient cost wise.  Third, if you have made it this far than soylent is probably for you, personally I missed breakfast everyday and with soylent I would make it the night before and I would grab it on my way out the door and be full all the way until lunch which was awesome because I finally had energy . If this sort of thing is your intended use then I highly suggest giving it a try it is an interesting experience  that I would recommend.   More proof to ignore the guy above is that soylent is made to be sustainable which means yeah they are not using powders that cost $150 per pound because that would not be feasible even though it would yield higher bioavailability of the nutrient. BUT watch the owners video about soylent bioavailability is a priority which means they actually take that into account when selecting the compounds. Lastly the other comment is correct many of the compounds you would not normally ingest (BUT are all FDA generally recognized as safe for consumption which is better than many workout supplements can say) so this leaves you with a higher risk of an adverse reaction to the drink. But even still it is very unlikely.  Feel free to ask anymore questions and don't be scared it doesn't taste that bad and is a cool experience!

The article says it comes down to around $9/day and during the two week test for it he only consumed soylent.

As far as economically goes I guess that is my fault for not explaining that my calorie intake is around 2700 calories and the shakes will only provide 2000 (I believe) per day, so for me I still had to find quite a few calories and I believe that price is the one if you sign up for reoccurring orders and not the one time order (though I might be mistaken).  Anyway, if I may ask what kind of healthier diet are you looking for? Whole foods and such is simply the best place to start and for me that was difficult because I hated fruits and vegetables and if that's is what you are looking to add in too I highly recommend starting to juice vegetables or order some juices at local juice bars because it helps transition your pallet to better food.  But if you are also like me I wanted soylent simply because it would allow me to have all of my calories without needing to run to McDonald's and it f not getting fast food is your goal well then go for it haha because fast food is difficult to get away from and very little bit helps.

Including moderation.  All fats are good and bad for you because there is no such thing as good and bad foods, just good and bad amounts of food.  Avocados are ""good"" fats because of the nutrient density of the fruit more so than the quality of the fat itself. Saturated fats help with hormone production and vitamin digestion. With the rise in polyunsaturated fats as being healthy several studies showed a drastic rise of PUFAs in clogged arteries. It's because people tend to have an all or nothing mentality with nutrition. The idea that sat fat causes heart disease comes from an old study by Ancel Keys where he picked and chose his results to fit what he wanted to find. Trans fats are the new devil, and there have been some found to naturally occur in cheese (what? naturally?) that helps prevent type 2 diabetes.  Fats are good for you.

A single study?  Really?  Ignoring the fact that most of the criticism of Ancel Keys is largely preposterous and made almost entirely by non-scientists (a topic worthy of its own consideration), consider the following:  A history of research into cardiovascular disease and cholesterol/saturated fat part 1  A history of research into cardiovascular disease and cholesterol/saturated fat part 2  Copy of cliff's notes:   We know from research into familial hypercholesterolemia that very high LDL, in and of itself, is capable of promoting atherosclerosis. This is also supported by other research demonstrating that these high levels, resulting in retention of ApoB particles in the intima of blood vessels, are actually responsible for the inflammation associated with heart disease, not merely a result of. Saturated fat is known to directly, negatively impact LDL receptor function, a mechanism analagous to what happens in familial hypercholesterolemia, and this has been verified in humans. Saturated fat and cholesterol have been demonstrated to reliably increase LDL/total cholesterol in the strictest of possible circumstances, i.e. metabolic ward trials. The exact role of saturated fat and cholesterol have on atherosclerosis appears complicated, with some research showing a negative impact, and other research failing to find this relationship. However, there appears to be a strong genetic component to dietary responses to these items, and it's possible that different people might have fundamentally different responses to saturated fat and cholesterol in their diets. Animal models of induced atherosclerosis, including close relatives like primates, can reliably induce atherosclerotic lesions by increasing an animal's endogenous cholesterol levels via feeding of saturated fat/cholesterol. Polyunsaturated fats, which appear to have the opposite effect on LDL receptor activity compared to saturated fats, seem to confer a protective effect with respect to heart disease and mortality when used as a replacement for saturated fat based on the randomized, controlled trials that have been performed to date.   It's also worth noting that there's a lot of direct biochemical research into the various pro-inflammatory pathways some saturated fatty acids very obviously activate:  Consumption of Saturated Fat Impairs the Anti-Inflammatory Properties of High-Density Lipoproteins and Endothelial Function  Saturated Fatty Acids Produce an Inflammatory Response Predominantly through the Activation of TLR4 Signaling in Hypothalamus: Implications for the Pathogenesis of Obesity   Look, research into saturated fat and all the mechanisms behind this stuff is ongoing, but this terrible strawmanning of the history of nutritional research crosses well beyond the line of uninformed into outright dishonest."

nutrition,3a5p6v,FrigoCoder,2,Thu Jun 18 07:57:20 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that these points probably still stand, and that most of the research supporting a positive impact of low carbohydrate diets on serum lipids is probably happening due to said diets being hyporcaloric (eating at a deficit) and resultant body composition modification, rather than low in carbohydrate.  Because the truth is you can eat half of anything as long as you are appreciably below maintenance and probably beneficially modify your lipids (e.g. twinkie diet guy).  Consider the following study...  http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=409791  Note these two figures:  http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/journals/intemed/5518/m_ira50015t5.png  http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/journals/intemed/5518/m_ira50015t6.png  Low fat diets almost always result in reductions to both total cholesteral and LDL, even when they're incredibly shitty implementations (i.e. most research that have participants eat pathetically low amounts of fiber with % of fat calories still often being pretty high, e.g. 30%). Low carb trials show mixed results, probably a result of genetic variability in response to saturated fat and cholesterol intake.  It's not difficult to find people whose LDL actually skyrockets on low carb diets, and people often go to great mental leaps to try to explain this away with thyroid hormone levels and the like when there's a fairly obvious explanation (some people hyper-respond to dietary saturated fat and cholesterol).  Which isn't to say I think low carb diets are useless - obviously they work very well for some people on appetite levels and subsequently body composition, and it's hard to imagine a situation in which somebody goes from obese to normal weight and doesn't have a net benefit in their overall health.  But if you had to choose an optimal diet for people with late stage cardiovascular disease I would be entirely uncomfortable putting them on a high saturated fat/cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet given the research I've shared in this thread."

HDL, as I assume you know, is more important than LDL.  The HDL to total cholesterol ratio is the gold standard in prediction of heart disease.  Sources on that at bottom.  In all three studies not only does high fat raise HDL, but HDL levels decrease with an increase in unsaturated fat.  They even specifically state cis bonds, not trans. When cholesterol is present your lipoproteins will increase.  That's why your body makes them.  The important thing is to keep your HDL levels up to transport excess cholesterol out of your arteries.

nutrition,3a5p6v,Zorg_Industries,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:34:55 2015 UTC,"HDL, as I assume you know, is more important than LDL.   Before going further I'd like to address this claim.  HDL is certainly important, but I'm going to highlight two major lines of evidence which indicate that LDL is the primary factor in the progression of atherosclerosis, as opposed to HDL:  Genetic variability in LDL and HDL levels and its impact on cardiovascular disease and mortality  People with genetically elevated levels of LDL have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease/mortality.  People with genetically low levels of LDL have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease/mortality.  More supporting the above  People with genetically high levels of HDL do not really appear to have any overall lower risk of cardiovascular disease.  Impact of drug trials that modify LDL or HDL on cardiovascular disease and mortality  Statins have a significant impact on cardiovascular disease risk and mortality and this is primarily mediated by their reduction in LDL.  See in particular this quote:   However, long-term risk reduction is very similar among statin and nonstatin approaches to lowering plasma LDL concentration. Therefore, the LDL-lowering action of statins is clearly the most important mechanism by which they decrease the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease(24,25).   A new, non-statin class of drugs show a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and mortality via reduction of LDL by an entirely different mechanism.  Different compounds and drugs which target increasing HDL do NOT appear to confer a protective effect for cardiovascular disease risk or mortality.  So, in summary:   Having genetically high LDL greatly increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Having genetically low LDL greatly reduces your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Having genetically high HDL doesn't appear to make much of an impact (or a minor impact) on cardiovascular disease. Drugs which substantially lower LDL (by entirely different mechanisms) have a significantly positive impact on cardiovascular disease risk and mortality. Drugs and other compounds which increase HDL do not appear to influence cardiovascular disease risk and mortality.   In my opinion the convergene of these lines of evidence make a very powerful case that LDL is the driving force behind atherosclerotic progression-->heart disease, not HDL.  Elevated HDL levels may modify this to some degree or another but the evidence is reasonably clear that they are NOT the primary factor in atherosclerotic progression."

Also many bodybuilders do claim to consume well over their body weight, but this does not mean it is safe and many of them know and understand the risks.

Optimal vegan diet typically ensures better nutrient and vitamin intake (minus B12). Optimal keto diet typically ensures high energy levels and reduces or eliminates GI problems. Both are great for weight loss if used properly.  When I was vegan I had low energy levels and had to eat pretty much constantly in order to not be hungry. It was also expensive. I struggled to get enough protein and lost muscle mass. I lost 15 lbs in 2 months.  When I was keto I lost 25 lbs in 2 months and had high energy levels, however, if I didn't watch my electrolytes like crazy I got horrible headaches and felt weak and dizzy. It did eliminate my GI problems, bloating, and water weight retention.  Being vegan taught me to prioritize healthy vegetables in my diet. Being keto taught me that eating fat does not make you fat and that in fact eating fat keeps you fuller longer than carbs do. In the end, a diet filled with variety and a proper balance of fat, protein and carbs is optiminal.  Animal products provide lots of energy in a small portion but eating only animal products and no veggies is not ideal - it's about balance."

The Vegan diet is synonymous with higher fiber intake and higher phytonutrients intake.  IMO keto seems to be a fast diet to lose weight, but this does not make it a healthy diet.  My questions to Keto advocates:    What is the evidence that Carbohydrates (excluding refined carbs) are unhealthy? What evidence is there that regular Red Meat consumption is healthy?  What evidence is there that high fat intake, particularly saturated fats is healthy?  On what basis do you dismiss the evidence of Red meat being connected to some cancers and also dairy being connected to some cancers? What is your consumption of veggies like, particularly leafy greens?   I can site specific studies for any bullet point if requested."
nutrition,3a0upk,ResoluteSir,12,Tue Jun 16 11:01:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the subject of vegan not being HCLF.  Of the same token, keto doesn't have to be a carnivore diet.  You can be both keto AND vegan AND raw too if that floats your boat.  The definition of a keto diet is simply one which derives energy from fats, sufficient protein to maintain the body, and carbs limited to those found in explicitly low carb vegetables.  A well formulated ketogenic diet additionally includes low carb vegetables, organ meats, bone broths or other foods dense in nutrients to ensure that you get essential nutrition.  Keto doesn't work for everyone, but for people on the Insulin resistance continuum (Middle aged spread ... prediabetes ... T2DM) it is a very effective diet to manage their energy regulation.  Keto is, as you say, popular for weight loss because many people who have weight to lose are on that IR spectrum.    But there are 2 categories of people who might chose a keto diet not necessarily for weight loss.  20% of all people with IR have visceral fat but not subcutaneous fat (Thin on the outside and Fat on the inside = TOFI) so they would likely thrive on a keto diet despite not specifically needing weight loss.  The other group is those in the other 80% who have also managed to lose their excess weight (Keto or Vegan or Weight watchers).  People who have a problem metabolising carbohydrates can lose all that excess weight and lose all their diabetic symptoms, yet still become metabolically deranged again as soon as they return to eating sugar and starch - so for them (including me) it's a long term strategy to safely fuel ourselves.    There is biochemical evidence that all carbohydrates that can be converted to glucose are metabolised the same.  A lot of people have problem with rapid absorption of glucose across the gut wall.  There is an hypothesis that fibre irritates the gut to produce a protective mucus that slows absorption of glucose, and speeds the transit of the bolus and that is why removing fibre makes carbs more dangerous (to your point about complex carbs).  We've known about the biochemistry of glucose for over 100 years, Fructose we only finished fully describing a few years ago - and we now know of it's causal biochemical role in dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension and gout.  But we need better hypotheses and trials to understand why it affects some people so badly, yet others can live off nothing but fruit and not get these diseases. There is some observational evidence that eating mammal (red) meat is unhealthy.  Nina Teicholz identified a number of problems with those observations such as not controlling for smokers, and that most of the meat was preserved (and there are hypotheses relating to nitrates that are interesting).  But really this is something we need to spend real money on to generate real RCT evidence rather than trying to tease information out of bad data.

We've never found actionable evidence, but took action anyway (http://openheart.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000196.full). As I said you don't have to eat red meat to be keto - I personally don't eat a lot of red meat though I do eat a lot of mammal fat.  There are sugars on the surface of mammal proteins that humans don't produce.  There is an hypothesis that that could be inflammatory or even carcinogenic to some people.  The fact that we've been eating mammals since our ancestors stood upright indicates this may be nothing - but again we need an RCT.  The state of 'evidence' against mammal meat is similar to the 'evidence' against mammal milk.  Personally I eat plenty of milk fat (Cream % Cheese) but very little milk proteins (like Casein) or sugars (Lactose). I eat about 100-150g of protein every day, 200g of low carb vegetables (leafy greens, brassicas), maybe 20g of other vegetables  (allums, chillies, berries) and the remainder in fats (Lard, Suet, EVOO, Nut Oils, Dripping, Coconut cream/oil, Cream/Butter, Cheese, Avocados)"

Here's the signs she's a bit dodgy:   She's not a dietitian, or a MD or even a scientist. She's a ""Investigative journalist"" She's flogging a book. GASP.  The book's name is based around a pun. It also includes the word ""surprise"".  Heres and extract I took off her website: ""1) they are far more nutrient dense than plant foods (and their nutrients have been shown to be more bio-available than those in plant foods). For instance, vitamin B12 is not available in plant foods. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K need fat to absorb properlyâand this fat comes naturally in animal foods. (The current USDA diet is inadequate in D without fortified foods.) Choline is hard to get in plant foods. Etc. 2) Protein and fat are far more satiating than carbohydrates, so people eating animal foods are less likely to overeat. One of the possible explanations for the obesity epidemic is that when Americans shifted to eating more carbohydrates, these less-satiating foods left them hungry and more likely to overeat. Studies show that people have a hard time overeating on protein and fat. Think about it: if you eat bacon and eggs for breakfast, youâre not hungry until lunch 3) Finally, the historical record supports a diet higher in animal foodsâ150 years ago, we ate far more red meat, cheese, butter and lard than we do today (butter and lard were the principal fats that Americans used for cooking before 1900). We ate this way before the epidemics of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (and plenty of people lived long enough to contract these diseases).""   That is just so stupid I cant explain. Point 1 she makes is based on deceiving . For example Vitamin A isn't in plants. Beta-carotene is however, doesn't need fat to be absorbed. Point 2 is based on NO science at all, I can tell you sugar is addictive, but she makes out that fat isn't? Why's KFC doing so fucking well, is it their fries bringing back customers?

Yes, and your gut agrees with me, which is why your ancestors evolved an adaptation to reduce its speed of absorption, and speed its transit through the gut.  If you eat a lot of food that trivially gets turned into glucose you will see a large spike in blood sugar.  Unless you are genetically blessed with the ability to safely and quickly metabolize that, you will gradually develop progressive insulin resistance - and slowly worsening blood glucose control.  Too much glucose in your blood will flood insulin-independent tissue with glucose.  That glucose is converted (polyol pathway) into sorbitol and fructose neither of which can now get out of the cell.  The resulting osmotic pressure kills the cells.  This is how persistent high blood glucose causes diabetic cataracts, retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.  My point about the danger of Carbohydrates and why removing fibre makes them more dangerous is that if you eat sugar or starch you need to also eat the fibre they came packaged.  The mucus the gut creates to protect itself from that fibre, also slows absorption of carbohydrates, and speeds the transit of the food so the gut is exposed to them for as little time as possible.  This is why it is safer to eat an orange and a bowl of oatmeal, than a glass of OJ and a bowl of froot loops.  We've made carbohydrate more potent by removing its fibre, and our bodies haven't had enough time to evolve an adapted response yet.  Some of us have become so metabolically deranged in the presence of dietary carbohydrates that we have been compelled to seek a safer energy source - fat."

You have absolutely no evidence to sport your claim.    Nothing I posted is in the least bit controversial, it's pretty much the textbook explanation for the digestion of fiber and the pathology of tissue damage caused by the progression of Type 2 diabetes.  On fiber stimulating the production of mucus to lubricate the gut Disruption-Induced Mucus Secretion: Repair and Protection   Mucus production is, moreover, stimulated by high-fiber diets, confirming that, under physiological conditions in vivo, a mechanism is in place for sensing and responding to mechanical stress with an increase in lubrication.   On fiber promoted gut mucus attenuating glucose absorption In Vitro Study of Possible Role of Dietary Fiber in Lowering Postprandial Serum Glucose   First, dietary fibers increase the viscosity of small intestine juice and hinder diffusion of glucose   On the Polyol hypothesis for the tissue damaging effects of Hyperglycemia - an article for the ADA that summarizes experimental evidence (with citations) that explains why Hyperglycemia targets insulin-independant cells to cause it's tissue damaging effects  The Pathobiology of Diabetic Complications   So why does damage occur only in the few cell types involved in diabetic complications? The answer is that most cells are able to reduce the transport of glucose inside the cell when they are exposed to hyperglycemia, so that their internal glucose concentration stays constant. In contrast, the cells damaged by hyperglycemia are those that cannot do this efficiently (3,4). Thus, diabetes selectively damages cells, like endothelial cells and mesangial cells, whose glucose transport rate does not decline rapidly as a result of hyperglycemia, leading to high glucose inside the cell.   ...   when the glucose concentration in the cell becomes too high, aldose reductase also reduces that glucose to sorbitol, which is later oxidized to fructose.    The study they specifically referenced regarding diabetic dogs and inhibiting aldose reductase to identify that the Polyol pathway is responsible was the first one to discover that osmotic stress was causing cataracts in the lens of the dog's eyes.  As for your reference of the Fung et al analysis: Leaving aside the notorious unreliability of self reported diet diaries, these so called ""Low Carb meat based"" diets were 100-150g/day of carbohydrates.  That is evidently not a low carbohydrate diet, that is a ""Meat and potatoes"" diet which everyone thinks is likely bad for you.  You want some science that support a Low Carbohydrate diet?    How about Chris Gardner's ATOZ study Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish, and LEARN Diets for Change in Weight and Related Risk Factors Among Overweight Premenopausal Women which contrasted Atkins, Ornish, Zone and the LEARN diets.  You can hear him discuss the study himself on Youtube.  I'm pretty sure you'll just go look at what the vegan apologists say about Gardner's study and regurgitate that and won't bother to watch that entire video, but that'll be your loss as it's an interesting presentation.  Personally I think his study doesn't test the safety of any diet, but rather how well people who are educated in each of the four diets were able to maintain their caloric restriction.  What he did show is that none of these diets were objectively bad based on the metabolic markers he chose.  His objective measurements (Trigs, HDL, Weight loss, BP) did show that the cohort who were educated on the lowest carbohydrate diet averaged slightly healthier results.  That must have been tough for a 25 year vegetarian to confirm that Atkins had better results than Ornish.  What I found interesting is that while on average the low carb diets had better results, there were people who consistently did well and people who consistently did poorly on each diet.  His hypothesis is that this may be related to their initial insulin resistance.  He is in the process of doing a followup study for NUSI doing a crossover study in a metabolic ward.  Hopefully we will soon have information that will allow us to predict who will do better on a vegan diet and who will do better on a ketogenic diet.

This is in contrast to conventional wisdom which says it's the same thing as a conscious restriction of calories, which unfortunately doesn't seem to work long term.

nutrition,3a0upk,ResoluteSir,0,Mon Jun 22 08:31:59 2015 UTC,"What evidence is there that high fat intake, particularly saturated fats is healthy?    You asked...   Saturated fat prevents coronary artery disease? An American paradox  What are the effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in comparison with those of a higher-fat, lower-carbohydrate diet? The response differs by the 2 main types of hyperlipidemia: simple hypercholesterolemia and combined hyperlipidemia. In our studies of simple hypercholesterolemia in men, a fat intake <25% of energy and a carbohydrate intake >60% of energy was associated with a sustained increase in triacylglycerol of 40%, a decrease in HDL cholesterol of 3.5%, and no further decrease in LDL in comparison with higher fat intakes (5). In contrast, a low-fat diet in persons with combined hyperlipidemia caused no worsening of triacylglycerol or HDL, but intakes of fat >40% of energy and of carbohydrate <45% of energy for 2 y were associated with a lower triacylglycerol concentration at a stable weight (6). In the subjects of Mozaffarian et al, a greater saturated fat intake paralleled a total fat intake, which ranged from 18% to 32% of energy in the first to fourth quartiles. Modest favorable trends in triacylglycerol and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were observed with higher fat intakes.  These effects include the paradox that a high-fat, highâsaturated fat diet is associated with diminished coronary artery disease progression in women with the metabolic syndrome, a condition that is epidemic in the United States.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/5/1102.full    On what basis do you dismiss the evidence of Red meat being connected to some cancers and also dairy being connected to some cancers?    People that consume red meat are ignoring the dietary guidelines.  Red meat consumption is strongly linked to refined carb intake (think burgers and soda), so is it the red meat or the refined carbs.  This is called the healthy user bias.  There's also the confounding variable that there are carcinogens created when you heat meat or any other food (e.g. french fries, bread, coffee).  So how do you eat your steak?  I eat mine very rare (European style rare).  Green leafy consumption / marinades can cut the carcinogen absorption by 90%, but who is eating veggies with their hamburgers and french fries?   What is your consumption of veggies like, particularly leafy greens?   About 2 pounds per day of non-starchy veggies.  A diet can be 60% fat with a ton of veggies because they're so calorically sparse.  It won't be ketogenic all the time, but if you eat one meal per day like I do, you'll be ketotic most of the time.  My questions...  The low fat & cholesterol recommendations of the 1980s-2000 were based on flawed observational studies.  We now know those weren't good recommendations, so why do we assume that our observational nutritional studies science are now correct?  We also know that with the SAME data that was available in 1980, the recommendations would have been very different had they been made today.  The data was not interpreted correctly, presumably because of the principal of ""least harm"".  Obviously, fat is bad.  Everybody knows that, even if there's little evidence to support that theory.  Eat real food.  Meat is real food.  Green veggies are real food.  Beans are real food.  Potatoes are real food.  Bread is not.  French fries are not."

Quite likely you're using corn oil that has been...   expeller-pressed, then solvent-extracted using hexane or 2-methylpentane (isohexane).[1] The solvent is evaporated from the corn oil, recovered, and re-used. After extraction, the corn oil is then refined by degumming and/or alkali treatment, both of which remove phosphatides. Alkali treatment also neutralizes free fatty acids and removes color (bleaching). Final steps in refining include winterization (the removal of waxes), and deodorization by steam distillation of the oil at 232â260 Â°C (450â500 Â°F) under a high vacuum.[1]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_oil  Why does your oil need to be deodorized?  Because it's oxidized?  Maybe you just eat french fries from a restaurant that's been heated, skimmed of particulates, and never dumped?  Polyunsaturated fat is not as resistant to heat as more saturated fats.  How long does your oil sit out?  Olive oil goes bad in a few months once you open it and it's more stable fat than corn oil.

In commercial bakeries, rising time has been winnowed from hours or even days down to mere minutes, thanks to fast-acting yeasts and additives. By contrast, the team in Jones' laboratory, located in a rural stretch along Puget Sound, lets dough rise for as long as 12 hoursâand they've found that the longer it rises, the less potent the gluten that remains in the finished bread.   http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/02/bread-gluten-rising-yeast-health-problem  You can give people with Celiac disease traditionally fermented sourdough bread and they don't show an increase in markers of inflammation just because you changed the yeast.

The bacteria will prevent the growth of mold and preserve the food.  The bacteria are also good for your gut.  If your wine or saurkraut is moldy, you did it wrong.  I lacto-ferment vegetables, which is very different than letting something sit out and rot.  Ever smell something moldy that had been lost in your fridge?  You'll want to gag.

My bloodwork is nearly flawless, but I am in very good shape, but since I am young this probably would not be an issue either way   Last cut I did, at a similar weight range, I was using carbs as my main fuel source, I was constantly hungry, which caused stupid mood swings, I was even at a lower deficit then now and had less muscle mass.

nutrition,3a0upk,Nutritarian,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"why did we evolve with the ability to empathise with animals, and react so strongly to their pain? That seems slightly counter-intuitive.   There was a recent discussion on /r/aww or /r/ELI5 or /r/AnimalsBeingBros, on why animals often nurture and raise young animals from other species, when it is obviously not advantageous from an evolutionary point of view.  The consensus was that this is simply a by-product of nurturing instincts originally aimed at younglings of the same species, and the disadvantages introduced by this side effect is not significant to affect species vitality. In fact it can be advantageous, for example if you raise dogs or cats. Same with empathy. So yeah, we have empathy to some animals.  We do not have empathy for the mass majority of them however. Basically if they are food, or not mammal, they can go to hell, especially the insects. Yes, we basically have a type of cognitive dissonance or doublethink or hypocrisy in this topic, I know it frustrates vegans to no end.  I vaguely remember a study that showed that vegans/vegetarians have higher activity in the brain areas responsible to empathy (?) compared to omnivores when presented with stereotypical ""prey"" animals, whereas no difference was found when presented with stereotypical companion animals.  I do not remember whether they found any gender differences, but it is plausible: Men had to kill the prey, any hesitation from their part meant starvation for the tribe and a huge disadvantage to the species. This might also partly explain why vegans are more likely to be women, they did not have to do the dirty work, they were presented with ""food"" instead of ""animals"", so they had less need to learn the distinction between prey and companion animals.   If anything, we should enjoy the suffering of animals, yet clearly we do not.   Enjoying animal suffering makes no sense evolutionary. Why waste time and energy, and risk escape or backlash just to be a jerk to food? Indifference makes much more sense. Just kill it, eat it, move on.  And such sadism could actually spill over to human interactions similarly to the empathy example above. Why, in fact dehumanization is the first step toward genocide.   Children from a young age know that hurting animals is wrong and would probably lose their shit if you decapitated an animal in front of them.   Children also refuse to eat their veggies, so pretty bad example there.  We also kinda hide the fact from children that meat comes from animals.   Also, fruit is the most appealing food to us visually, scent and taste wise in its untouched raw form. No other foods like animals compare.    Probably because you mainly eat fruits and not animal products. One thing I have noticed both in the vegan and the keto community is that tastes and cravings adapt to a diet change after a while. Vegans often report after a few months or years that they find even the smell of meat disgusting. Few months on keto, and the desire for bread, chips, and other carbohydrate cravings simply stop. There is even a video of a fat woman previously living on junk food trying vegetables for possibly the first time, her gagging is way too funny. Personally I stopped using sunflower oil for cooking, and now I can feel even the slightest hint of that disgusting taste.  Besides, fruits were not available year round. The only food source that is available during winters, are animals."

Pigs, cows as well as dogs and cats. Maybe not as MUCH, but I believe it's still there.   especially the insects.   Considering we have always stepped on insects, I don't think it would be biologically viable for us to feel stress over killing (or stepping on them) but who likes to watch a butterfly die? NOBODY.   Enjoying animal suffering makes no sense evolutionary.   Correct me if I'm wrong but if you're a lion and you rip into an animal and hear it scream, wouldn't you be feeling shot up with dopamine? I'd imagine that animal prey screams and suffering are exciting to some animals, as indicated by dolphins (especially these fuckers), monkeys, wolves and other animals that kill solely for fun. Why would they be indifferent to an activity that they repeat over and over? Clearly they must enjoy it.    Probably because you mainly eat fruits and not animal products.

But there are potential negative effects linked to a vegan diet that may not appear until you have children. Or grandchildren. I suggest people read up on epigenetics and how environmental factors can contribute to gene expression.  One study found that 58% of participating vegetarians were B12 deficient. Yes, we've all heard that before, but the problem is that it can cause successive generations to be more susceptible to things like cancer, atherosclerosis (thickening of artery walls), and other diseases. Ironically, diseases typically linked to high fat diets. Another researcher found that children and grandchildren of vegan parents suffered from diminished intelligence.  One ex-vegan even went so far as to advocate a paleo diet and point out that there haven't been enough long term studies on the epigenetic effects of veganism and that the majority of studies that portray veganism in a positive light are conducted by vegans, leading to potentially biased findings.

Studies finding diminished intelligence in successive generations when compared to diets that include meat are pretty significant and need to be expanded upon. Since a ketogenic diet includes animal products, not as much emphasis has been placed.  Regardless, this article goes into the importance of epigenetics in terms of infant development and discusses the importance of ketosis during infancy, indicating that, in terms of infant development at least, a ketogenic diet is healthier and more beneficial than a vegan one. In the interests of full disclosure, I do not follow a keto diet.  This article covers the basics of epigenetics while this one, by the same author, discusses the epigeneitc effects of a ket diet, its role in protecting against oxidative damage (basically helping the body detoxify itself and heal damage), even lowering the chances of develop cancer by slowing cell division.

I think pretty much all the negative effects that have been attributed to vegan diets have connections to B12 deficiency, but research designed to confirm that would be great.

It seems especially silly when comparing a diet designed to elicit a particular physiological state to one based on ethics. It's quite possible to have a ketogenic diet and be vegan at the same time, and is probably pretty easy to pull off for an infant when you include breast milk from someone with a healthy vegan diet.

nutrition,3a0upk,plantpistol,5,Tue Jun 16 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"B12 should not be a stumbling block for any vegans because B12 pills are dirt cheap (seriously, they're like pennies-a-pill and even CVS carries them).  FWIW, I've been vegan nearly 20 years and my B12 levels are fine (along with everything else in the full panel they did a few months back).  I don't do anything special except take a multi-vit every day or two with lunch.   But there are potential negative effects linked to a vegan diet that may not appear until you have children.    That's what you claim, but you didn't actually post any evidence to support that claim, so I'm gonna go ahead and say I disagree with you there, sir."

The research is still ongoing but the fact that even one 10-year old study found an epigenetic link to increased cancer risk and cardiovascular disease can't really be ignored. An increased risk is still an increased risk, just like those studies people cite saying there's an increased risk of heart disease from eating too much red meat. You would likely find that relevant then, so I would have to retort that this is relevant now.  And from what I'm finding, B12 is just the most common deficiency that people are aware of. Iron deficiency is apparently quite common and linked to diminished intelligence and an increase in anemia."

But the main reason I personally do not follow a vegan diet (and keep in mind, I'm not trying to tell you that you shouldn't be vegan. You're old enough to choose to smoke and drink, so you're old enough to choose what to eat in my book) is because so far in this discussion I've pointed out the potential necessity for four different supplements in a vegan diet.

The PETA backed studies and research backed by vegans and vegan food distributers espousing the amazing benefits of veganism? But you're paranoid about whether research showing the negatives of veganism received money from people who eat meat? Isn't that a bit of a double standard? Surely you see the contradiction there, that somehow no vegan food manufacturer suffers from greed or has a financial stake? That PETA isn't driven by getting money from their donors and would benefit from findings that keep their donors donating to their cause?   The ""extraordinary claim"" is that veganism is fine.   No, the extraordinary claim, in your words, is ""that veg diets are either neutral or beneficial & reduce the risk of many diseases."" No negatives at all? None?

No negatives at all? None?   You seem to insist that veganism is harmful.  What do you think could be so harmful about eating plants?  Meat is just protein, fat, some vitamins (and god knows what hormones, antibiotics, chemicals, and other stuff they're pumping into the animals on factory farms that they don't have to disclose to the public).   You can get all that stuff from plant sources (minus the antibiotics and growth hormones)   Even herbivorous animals suffer from heart disease.   So do vegans.  I never said they didn't.  Steve Jobs (vegan) died of cancer.  Plenty of vegans die from cancer and stroke and heart disease.  The key point is that the overall risk is lower.  Not zero, but lower.   And vegans have a greater chance of children epigenetically inheriting a greater susceptibility to those same health issues   That's according to you, and one very preliminary study that even says itself that it's far from being conclusive.

Which is probably why we're currently referred to as the Medication Generation. We'd rather pop a pill than get it from the natural source   And you're free to do that.  I get most of my vitamins from natural sources too.  I take a vitamin to make sure I've got my bases covered.  Some people have issues absorbing certain vitamins.  Better safe than sorry.  But to your point about ""natural vs. pill"" - Vitamin C is Vitamin C, regardless of source.  Whether you get it from a grapefruit or from a tablet, it's the same chemical.  Your body doesn't ""know"" if the Vitamin is from a fresh orange of if it was pressed into a tablet in a factory.  I'd rather get things like Omega-3 from eating flax seed or taking a flax oil pill than deal with all the mercury that's in fish now.    I'd rather bet B12 that's made from algae and added to my soymilk than have to worry about whatever contaminants and hormones & antibiotics are in meat these days.

You don't need to chew a piece of bread, you just mush it with spit/water, and swallow.  You have to seriously chew your way through a piece of steak.  The steak actually has fewer calories on a per gram basis as well than the bread (215 vs. 274 calories for a 100 gram portion).  That difference in the time it takes you to eat (even for the same number of calories) has a huge effect on you recognizing you're full.  Meat is fully digested and chewing won't really affect that.  Veggies/nuts are generally not and chewing will allow more caloric extraction, but the time delay matters."

Can't put on weight eating 2500 calories a day? Bump it to 3000 and see what happens. Keep bumping til the scales come up.

For instance, I will list all the high FODMAP foods in your sample meal plan:    Bread/toast  Cous cous Hokkien noodles Lentils (red/green) Pasta Water crackers Sweet potato  Onion Garlic  Avocado Snow peas Snap peas Mushrooms Asparagus  Zucchini ( >100 grams) Apple Almonds Nut butters (almond, cashew) Dairy (lactose containing) Coke (if HFCS is used) Protein/candy bar (most likely depending on ingredients) Sweetened yogurt Dips (depending) Most processed foods -in general- will contain some high FODMAP ingredients   As you can see, your current diet is riddled with high FODMAP foods. If your chief complaints are bloating, cramps, and lethargy... then I highly suggest you research what FODMAPs are and what you can do about them. The Monash University puts out the best research on the topic."

I've never been able to follow the diet strictly because I just love food too much, thus I deal with the consequences when I over-indulge.  I didn't realize that your symptoms started in the past month. Thus, I would look into the possibility of iron overdose. The symptoms of having too much iron mimic that of having too little, so it can be confusing to someone who is trying to self diagnose. I would also ask your doctor specifically what tests were performed, as an iron test is not always standard. Also see if your B12 levels were tested.   Get tested for Mononucleosis. Get STD testing done. Take pregnancy test."

I'm studying Nutrition in my naturopathic studies and I agree with a lot of things said on here and I myself have been through similar things. All I can is that you do probably need to boost your caloric intake in a balanced way so carbs, fat, and protein (listen to what your body is saying!), check to see that your b12 levels have been tested as this is predominantly found in animal foods (when I was a casual vegetarian and was doing a lot of running and too strict of a diet I ended up deficient in this not iron), FODMAPs is great for addressing ibs type symptoms but your probably right in saying that given your weight it's probably not wise to undertake right now (I made that mistake last year and lost even more weight), and your probably over doing it with the running and exercise it sounds like you need rest which is what it sounds like your doing atm. Other than that I don't know what you do for a living, i'm not sure if you posted that, but being stressed a lot (not eating enough and too much exercise is also a stress on the body) can result in poor digestion such as low appetite and bloating. Also having low b12 status can really affect your appetite too as when I was deficient i'd be full after one bite. But yeah try reducing stress as well. You'd probably feel a lot better with a few lifestyle changes. For me not eating enough and over exercising plus stress made me very ill. Now I eat all the foods that I was restricting, I no longer run but I am more active with a part time job where I'm on my feet, and just allowing myself to rest without feeling guilty. I hope you feel better soon :-D"

But vitamin b12 is very important and the best sources of it are seafoods, lamb, and probably liver.  Just do a quick Google search, that should give you plenty of info. Although taking a supplement is very easy. And if you were to do that get the sublingual forms as they're better absorbed.   And I hope this doesn't sound bitchy but just because you've been exercising the same way since you were a teen doesn't mean that it's always going to have the same effect. It's the same with eating patterns. Our bodies change and can react to things that were previously okay to us.  And it does suck because we become so entrenched in our habits."

It takes a lot of tweaking and lessons learned. But a few questions/observations/suggestions:    Why is your lunch fruit instead of the lentils/chickpeas/vegetable soup with the fruit being meal 3/4 as a snack? It sounds like you are consuming a lot of fruit, and therefore sugar (which don't get me wrong, this is way better than a lot of alternatives) but seems like you could be replacing some of that with more protein and leafy greens to get the results you're looking for. You could mix it up by getting carrots, red peppers, etc. and making a simple hummus out of the chickpeas to dip it into.  Have you tried plugging your daily foods into myfitnesspal to ensure you are getting the appropriate split of macros for your desired results? I find this tedious to do everyday personally but doing it here and there or consistently for a week really helps to gauge your actual protein/carb/fat split. I know i thought i was getting significantly more protein than i was, and also believing I was consuming way more calories than i was prior to using this tool.   Have you explored /r/veganfitness? Bodybuilding.com is also an excellent resource to just get a general idea of the macro splits you need, which you can then follow still using your dietary restrictions. Seitan is also a really fantastic source for protein and really easy to mix into your lunch or dinner with some quinoa (also a great source for protein) and veggies.    Hope this helps a little."

nutrition,3a275y,MPfiff,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"In my opinion there is no great nutrition book. Some are good, but none are great. Simply put, the lack of conclusive research on many nutrition subjects means authors must tread a fine line. A thorough examination of the evidence and the potential implications and limitations of such evidence often doesn't sell well, because most people want simple answers. So many authors often display confidence that their beliefs are correct beyond what I think the evidence calls for.  Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy often has this issue in my opinion. Not as consistently or as flagrantly as many diet books, but Willet is many cases treats food hypotheses as more established than they are.  For example, he is opposed to potatoes as a food. He claims they trigger a ""blood sugar roller coaster"" which ""triggers the early return of hunger pangs. These starches are also implicated aspart of the perilous pathway to heart disease and diabetes"". This anti-potato viewpoint is not strongly supported by evidence, so he primarily invokes this mechanism of the glycemic index to explain why the potato is unhealthy. This viewpoint has been critiqued (1,2) and in my opinion is poorly supported.  Even though according to Willett potatoes are supposed to cause hunger a study (3) which tested how satiating various foods were (all in 240 calorie servings) found that of the 38 foods tested potatoes were the most filling, more filling even than many foods Willett's book recommends.  The Mediterranean diet as it is usually tested recommends eating root vegetables, e.g. the potato. This was the case in the Lyon Diet Heart study (4), a diet trial where the Mediterranean diet eating group had far less cardiovascular disease, cancer, and also died less.  There isn't much experimental evidence on the potato, but as a historical note in 1902 at the Societe de Therapeutique in Paris the clinician M. Mosse reported that when he had his diabetic patients eat 1 to 4 pounds of potatoes every day the amount of sugar in their urine (glycosurea) was reduced, often disappearing completely.  For more anecdotes, experiments, and observations on people eating potatoes read this link: http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2010/10/potatoes-and-human-health-part-iii.html  So obviously this is just one part of the entire book I'm taking issue with but it represents what I think is an example of the problem I have with this book. One side of the issue is presented quite often. This might be ok with me if Walter was more tentative with his conclusions, but I feel there are issues with many of his beliefs yet he presents a number of them as if his beliefs are not up for debate.   http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/154/12/1160.2.full http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2009/03/its-time-to-let-go-of-glycemic-index.html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7498104 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(94)92580-1/abstract"

nutrition,3a275y,StuWard,3,Tue Jun 16 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"In general I think we do have a good understanding of what a healthy diet looks like (generally containing vegetables, fruit, and seafood), but there are a number of elements I think are still unclear. Things like the best type of fat (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated) as well as if and when dairy and red meat should be included in a healthy diet I consider a disputable issues.  Edit: For the record, I do think Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy is a good book (it just isn't great). I also like the book ""Perfect Health Diet"" by Paul Jaminet. It's not a perfect book either but I think it provides a great contrast to some of the uncertain issues I've mentioned. Both books definitely agree on many things, but disagree on others. I'm not saying I find Perfect Health Diet more compelling but it's good to get a well rounded view of topics and I think the two books achieve this."

Managing your impulses is not going to work out when you're high.  Maybe address the reasons for using weed and try to quit. It'll be doing you no favours however 'ok' it seems right now. It's the same as coming home and having wine every evening. Might be socially acceptable but it's not a healthy way to unwind. Changes to your job and learning better ways to manage stress should help.  There's nothing you can do after a binge. The best thing is to keep hydrated and wait to poop it out. You could try eating some protein rich food while you binge so you won't get such a sugar spike and should slow down the digestion of the sugary food. It could also be more filling and lower the binge volume.   Otherwise it's just giving your body time to digest the food and poop it out.  You could also try some behavioural management techniques. Have you binge, but try to have a tiny, tiny amount less. For example reduce the pack of oreos by one, or get a lower calorie version of some other piece of junk food you normally get, but just a bit smaller. Do that for a week or so, then repeat until you get to something you find reasonable to binge on. Still have your binge, but try to get the size down. Saying 'yes' instead of trying to control your urges will help in the long run. Just modify what you're saying yes to.  Binge eating is also really common amongst people prone to perfectionism. If you work really hard, keep all the plates spinning and expect a lot of yourself, you might want to consider getting some help with that or trying to be a bit more slap dash in different areas of your life. You may then reduce the need for weed in the evenings to relax you.   Hope this is useful even if it's not a 'quick fix' solution."

Next time you go grocery shopping skip the oreos and get healthy snacks for bingeing instead. In my experience it's hard the first couple days but once you get used to it, its just totally normal and you feel way better. One thing I did was buy a bag of bite-sized candies, and I'd eat a really healthy dinner and allow myself 5 of those candies as a reward. Usually I was able to stick to it, and that gave me enough of a reward that I didn't binge on other stuff.  3. Instead of eating or drinking soda, get some different kinds of teas. You can try out different flavors and its actually really fun when you're stoned. Then instead of nonstop oreos you are just drinking teas in different flavors as a substitute, and you can really enjoy the subtleties of more floral flavors versus darker flavors, etc."
nutrition,3a1mbl,tka11486,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"2 things that I did that helped a lot. I stopped eating breakfast, leangains-style. I'm not hungry in the morning so it wasn't hard for me. Instead, I would eat my breakfast foods around 8PM because, like you, that's when I get hungry. That really helped because I would get really full after eating a full supper then another meal 2-3 hours later.   The other thing is having more satiating, healthy foods to munch on. Pumpkin seeds, eggs, greek yogurt, cottage cheese, etc.  These days I'm trying to put on some weight so I started eating breakfast, but self-control doesn't seem to be as much of an issue anymore, as long as I keep eating healthy satiating foods."

If nothing else, it's really great for taking when you have an upset stomache. I've been on the verge of full blown food poisoning, and just a few capsules got me feeling back to normal within about 45 minutes...   I even open a capsule once in awhile and brush my teeth with it to remove coffee stains. My teeth always look brightly polished and a notch or two whiter when I do this.. I think it's commonly used as a face wash as well. It's just great for general detoxing/cleaning."

If you're losing quicker than you want to/or at a quick pace and you are miserable because food, go up. Calculators can be helpful for rough estimates, but it's always best to be intelligently adjusting as needed.

I simply recommend weighing yourself every two weeks and if you didn't lose 2-4lbs, reduce what you eat for the following two weeks.  Repeat.

I find it much more accurate than myfitnesspal for example. I have the basic fitbit one, which measures steps walked, speed, and stairs climbed. It seems to give me an accurate number of calories burned per day.  If you don't mind people seeing that you're using it, getting a bracelet type that also measures heart rate would probably be even more accurate. There are plenty of different ones out there, fitbit and jawbone up are the ones I see mentioned the most.  If you don't want to wear something like that, or you don't have the money to spend, you might just want to experiment. Try sticking to 2250 for two weeks, then see how much weight you've lost. A calorie deficit of 500 a day amounts to 1 pound list per week. At the start of a diet you might loose extra weight ( water weight, not fat), but if you stick with it you'll see over time if you're loosing at the speed you ""should"" be. Adjust accordingly.  Aldo keep in mind that your tdee goes down as you loose weight, as lower body weight = lower caloric burn. You'll probably need to re-adjust your intake for every 5 pounds lost or so.  Good luck!"

Take that number and subtract 500 calories for every pound of weight you want to drop in a week. You shouldn't aim for more than 2 lbs per week. Keep in mind that a greater drop in calorie intake does not mean you will lose more fat. If you're doing lots of cardio, you will lose some muscle mass as well as fat mass. If you want to bulk on muscle you will need more protein and fat which means more calories! Caloric intake isn't just dependent on your activity but also your body type, body composition and goals - so a website generator isn't going to be very accurate.

No carby sauces ever, there are ways to make sauces without carbs. If I need healthy fats I stick to avocados, coconut oil, and maybe some heavy cream with my coffee.

Also, if you're already eating a diet with a moderate amount of healthy fats (i.e. Avocados, Virgin Coconut oil, almonds,  some fatty fish) you do not necessarily need to cut those. Simple Carbohydrate restriction is probably the best way to feel less hungry through out the day and thus, eat less. Make sure to try and get the bulk of your carbs from veggies and fruits (which will do wonders to clean up your diet) and only take in sugar right after a workout. Try not to cut your protein intake too much, since your body needs this to repair itself after a workout. Hope this helps and good luck!"

You need more protein, dried or canned beans are cheap and go great with rice. A cup of cooked beans and a cup of cooked brown rice provide almost all the protein you need for one day. Eggs are also a cheap source of protein. Sometimes you can find cheap frozen fish. Way back when I used to buy frozen perch for 29 cents a pound. The cats and I had it often.  Check out what's in the canned aisle. Lots of beans, chilis, even things like chicken, sardines, tuna. See what's on sale. You can also find canned veggies. They're not ideal, especially because of the high salt content, but they're better than no veggies, and good to mix with canned beans. For instance, mix a can of beans, a can of tomato sauce and a can of corn for an easy bean dish. You can add chopped onion to this or other chopped veggies. If you can afford it use salsa instead of tomato sauce. Or mix veggies, sauce and rice. Or mix beans, rice, sauce, veggies. Whatever. Do rinse canned beans and veggies to reduce the sodium load.

They have peanut butter, they have canned tomatoes, they have Kraft dinner. Go for it! read flyers, stock up on non-perishable things that are on sale. learn to cook beans, eggs, and cheap cuts of meat. if your budget includes social activities, reduce the costs as much as possible. Find ways to be social on the cheap (boardgames, exercise outside, potlucks at your place (you get the leftovers!) if your budget includes weed and/or cigarettes, join /r/leaves and /r/stopsmoking and plug that massive hole in your pocket and drain on your life    get a part time job that only requires you to work a few hours per week. Look for opportunities on campus (tutoring!) or put out an ad saying that you're available to clean houses ($60 for 3 hours work!) or walk dogs. sell stuff you don't need reduce your phone plan to the most bare-bones arrangement possible make goals for yourself about what specific career you're working toward (check on the job prospects for that career and make sure they're good in the place you want to live) and do everything you can and work your hardest to be the best candidate for a future job in the that field. this is so that when you feel like you're denying yourself expensive, fun things now, you can at least know that you're working toward being at a place in life when you can afford to do and have the things you want in life and not end up as one of the many, many college grads working for minimum wage out there."

How can that be a misconstrual when that's exactly what ""no appreciable relationship"" means?   The original statement in the report cited 2 sources, one was a meta analysis concluding, ""egg consumption is not associated with the risk of CVD and cardiac mortality.""

I personally think high levels of blood LDL cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease but how a food affects LDL shouldn't be the only thing that determines which foods we should eat when other evidence is available.   http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n6/abs/ejcn201045a.html   ""...compared with those with the lowest intake of full-fat dairy, participants with the highest intake (median intake 339 g/day) had reduced death due to CVD (HR: 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12â0.79; P for trend=0.04) after adjustment for calcium intake and other confounders. Intakes of low-fat dairy, specific dairy foods, calcium and vitamin D showed no consistent associations"""

I like to encourage people to work on 1 or 2 specific goals every week.  These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely....or SMART.  These are lifetime goals you should adopt forever.  For example ""I will eat 10 cups of vegetables this week"" or ""I will limit myself to no more than 15 grams of added sugar a day"".  If you're looking for a diet 'just for the summer' it's not going to end well and you will regain the weight.

The lower carb diets are much more effecting when one is in the 10-12% body fat range and looking to lean out to single digit body fat percentage. If you go too low carb, when you get off the diet, it will be really easy to gain weight again. Focus on keeping a deficit (somewhere between 250-1000 calories a day) and good nutrition.

Do you know what symptoms I would experience if I was low on protein? I know if a person is extremely low they will get kwashiorkor I think it's called?

Therefore, you'll still see fat labeled.   As to eating 1200 calories fat - compared to what? Compared to protein or high fiber / low starch vegetables? Protein and vegetable sources like that will have more micronutrients available than if you're eating a pure glob of fat, but you'll find all three highly satiating. They're bulky and take time to digest, providing measured energy over time. Also, for sheer bulk, you'd be hard pressed to eat 1200 calories of leafy green vegetables.  On a side note to that, some of their micronutrients are fat soluble and won't be absorbed well without a little fat.   Compared to 1200 calories carbohydrate? You'll eat that, get a massive insulin spike to clear the blood sugar increase, still have eaten 1200 calories, and be hungry again right away. The more complex they are, the more that will slow that down, at least, but that's a whole other post, as it gets confusing for how things are labeled.

For example, I love stir fry, so I'll toss two bags of stir fry mix in the wok with olive oil and sauce, eat that, followed by a few chicken breasts. Then I'll have oatmeal with peanut butter, fruit, more chicken, maybe eggs, yogurt. Sometimes a lot of my calories will come in liquid form: I mix Greek yogurt, almond milk, cup or two of egg whites, and fruit. It comes out to like 60-70g of protein and probably like almost 700 calories or so. I often prefer to just eat a whole lot of food and then be done eating for the next 24 hours."
nutrition,39nth4,intangiblemango,2,Sat Jun 13 06:48:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think 600 is a lot for a dinner type meal, which this sounds like. I eat 1500/day for weight loss and I eat about 500-600 calories for dinner sometimes (though I usually prefer saving some of those calories for snacks/dessert)."
nutrition,39nth4,pajamakitten,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:38:06 2015 UTC,"What the hell kind of life are you living where 600 calories is a lot for a meal for an adult man? I am a fit, average-height lady who is maintaining my weight and I eat a lot more than that..."
nutrition,39nth4,intangiblemango,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:37:21 2015 UTC,If you're the sort of person who eats 5-6 times a day then 600 would be a lot for someone who isn't bulking. If you're only eating three meals a day with no snacking then 600 is a perfectly good number of calories for a meal.
nutrition,39nth4,britrochtay,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:05:37 2015 UTC,"First off, even if you are the type of person who eats 5-6 times a day, your meals are probably not all exactly the same size. When I was at my most sedentary and losing weight, I lost at around 1600 calories a day and I would do my absolute best to make sure that 1000 calories of that was reserved for dinner because I am a night eater and am MUCH happier going without in the morning or afternoon so I can stuff my face at night. (I know some other people are morning eaters or prefer different food patterns.) Even if you go on /r/1200isplenty, which is the lowest calorie subreddit I am aware of that does not actively promote eating disorders, you'll see plenty of meals upwards of 400 calories, and that is for teeny little ladies who are losing weight and not exercising any notable amount...  Furthermore, if you're an active, tall adult man, 3000 calories still isn't a crazy amount even outside of a bulk (600 calories 5 times a day). If you go to /r/fitness, you'll fine a fair number of people who maintain at higher amounts than that. OP didn't give any information about his activity level or goals, but those people definitely exist. Personally, I'm quite active (both in terms of cardio and strength) and, as a 5'6"" lady, I'm maintaining a (strong!) 125-130 lbs at around 2500 calories a day. Obviously most people are not as active as I am, but an athletic man would almost certainly be taller and more muscular than I am, and would burn more calories both by existing and during exercise. Does OP need that? No, probably not. But it would be a VERY strange situation where OP would be unable to healthfully take in a 600 calorie meal.  I am assuming that we are more or less on the same page here, but the reason I feel the need to note that 600 calories is not AT ALL an unreasonable portion size for virtually all adults is because I think these kinds of things can discourage overweight or out of shape people from taking steps to promote their health. Even if you sit on your butt all day, you don't need to freak out about reasonable portions of brown rice, lean ground beef, black beans, chopped lettuce, and a tablespoon of queso (which is what we are ultimately talking about here). You don't have to eat like a bird; you just have to eat like a person. And fabulously, if you are active, it not only feels amazing, you get to eat a shitload of food while looking great!"

Obviously it can go as high as 80 if it's a larger piece packed with fatty sauce and cream cheese (like a volcano roll).  But it can also go small as 40 if it's something like a cucumber roll or a smaller piece of sushi.  EDIT: As for macros, mostly carbs and protein; some fat if there's avocado or cream cheese.

nutrition,39nzik,lovechip,2,Sat Jun 13 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it could just be the dried fruit. If I even look at dried fruit I get chronic trapped wind that's so painful. I made the error of eating a single prune yesterday and was in pain for hours after. It'll be the sugar content in it.  Try switching it for something like nakd bars which have dried fruit but also nuts, so will be less sugary. They're really tasty.   Also consider which veggies you're having. Cruciferous veg can make horrifying gas. Stuff like brocoli and cauliflower, but they're really nutritious. I also find how the veg is cooked makes a difference. Roasted veg makes me stink, but steamed, boiled or raw is fine.   Consider moving to less sugary veg like dark green veg, some tomatoes/onion/peppers are ok, salads. Stuff like peas and carrots are quite sweet."
nutrition,39nzik,easylocarb,2,Sat Jun 13 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you managed to find dried fruit that isn't just concentrated fruit sugars ... but OK, low-carb dried fruit FTW.  Don't worry too much about fibre, it's primary benefit is that it slows uptake of carbs and speeds transit of the 'food'.  If you are not eating carbs you don't need fibre to protect you against glucose spikes.  As far as the gas, I suspect your gut biome is gradually reacting to the change of diet.  Some bacteria in there are doing it tough because the food they are best adapted to eat is no longer being served - so they are probably trying less efficient metabolic pathways and probably wasting energy.  Others are multiplying like rabbits because all of a sudden the buffet is serving all their favourite foods.  It's an emerging science so there's not much experimental evidence how long the adaptation to a new diet takes - but when I went low-carb it took about 2 months for my gut to get comfortable with a significant change in the energy source.  Make sure you're not dehydrated.  When you maintain low insulin levels your kidneys dump more minerals and with it water - so you need to not give your body an excuse to draw water from the gut in order to produce urine.  It's worth looking into magnesium supplementation.  The amount of water maintained in the food transiting the gut seems particularly sensitive to Magnesium levels.  Also Magnesium is muscle relaxant.    Everyone needs different levels, the only way I know to find out is to start increasing until the problem goes away and then slowly decrease until it comes back - and that's your sweet spot.  I know I said don't worry about fibre, and eventually once your gut has adapted to the new regime you won't need to ... but it may be worth giving it a gradual change by supplementing with psyllium husks and gradually decreasing the amount you need to add."
nutrition,39nzik,plantpistol,2,Sat Jun 13 13:34:40 2015 UTC,"I buy the dried fruit from Trader Joe's. I stuck to the dried apricots and prunes because they have the least amount of sugar compared to mango or banana.   Also, I'll look into the supplements you mentioned. Hadn't considered either."
nutrition,39nzik,BezStraha,2,Sat Jun 13 16:28:21 2015 UTC,If you're eating a lot of fruits and vegetables more so than before then it's probably the extra fiber. It happened to me when I went on a whole plant-based diet. It took me about 2-3 months to adjust and now there are no problems.

nutrition,39nzik,BezStraha,2,Sun Jun 14 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"Carbs are not your enemy. Carbs are fuel. Overall caloric intake and expenditure dictate weight loss, or gain. Diet makeup (macros) affect body composition.  Fiber is great, but you have to increase intake gradually. You also need both kinds of fiber, soluble and insoluble. Soluble (edit) fiber attracts water and slows down digestion, helps to keep you satiated and to keep insulin in check. Add an acute increase in protein intake and you have a recipe for lots of smelly farts and some constipation. :)  Insoluble fiber moves things along. Fruit is a great source of insoluble fiber. Personally, I love pineapple. I eat 2 to 4 cups of it pretty much daily. (Adjust for your dieting needs/goals) It's great for digestion, absolutely delicious and cures any sweet cravings I may have. It is also a great source of bromelain http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromelain  Franco Columbu, who in addition to being a renowned bodybuilder was also one of the strongest men in the world and a nutritionist, ate pineapple daily.

The extract has a history of folk medicine use. As a culinary ingredient, it may be used as a meat tenderizer.  The term ""bromelain"" may refer to either of two protease enzymes extracted from the plants of the family Bromeliaceae, or it may refer to a combination of those enzymes along with other compounds produced in an extract.

Second, fiber helps resolve constipation, it does not cause it.   If anything, your problem is too little fiber, not too much.   Why dried fruit? Having the water removed concentrates the calories, so you get to eat less of it for more calories. Eat fresh fruit instead.  Eat more plant foods and I bet your problem will resolve. Plants have plenty of protein."

It is apparently a huge PITA to get credits to transfer internationally because countries sometimes divide their lower level sciences differently. State shouldn't matter.  I haven't heard of pre-requisites expiring because foundational science knowledge doesn't change that quickly. GRE scores definitely expire though so I would wait until you are less than a year out from applying to take it or any comparable graduate entrance exam. If you decide to take a class or two that would actually count toward a dietetics degree itself (food science, counseling, nutritional biochemistry, etc.), transfer credit for that may expire, but if you're just doing pre-requisites then this doesn't apply to you."

In order to become a dietitian, you must have a bachelors in a nutrition-related field. After obtaining a bachelors, you must complete a dietetic internship. In 2020, all dietitians are required to have a masters (except for those that became an RD before 2020). So, if you want to beat this deadline, you better hurry! However, I think a masters in nutrition is actually important to have before working with patients. It's always best to have as much knowledge as possible before giving advice.   Sorry, I got a little off topic. Check out the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' website and look through some of the internships. When you find one you're interested in, go to their website and look at their requirements. This will give you an idea of what you need in undergrad. However, if you attend a DPD program it should prepare you for almost any internship/masters program in dietetics.  http://www.eatrightacend.org/ACEND/content.aspx?id=10760  Best of luck to you!

My BA is not in a related field - I only took two basic nutrition classes bc that's all that was allowed outside of my major.   So I'd have to go back and start a different BA from scratch? Or can I achieve a BA in a related field with less classes since I already have one?  I will check out that website.   It sounds like I might be in for a few more years of education than I previously thought! I am glad I am thinking about it so far out in advance.

I actually switched into a nutrition degree from chemical engineering (I was doing great in the major, but just didn't like the material). At my university, nutrition has a very heavy science background, so luckily I could use all of my chemistry/biology/biochemistry towards my nutrition degree. I switched into nutrition as a junior and still was able to finish my undergrad in 4 years! So depending on the classes you've already taken and what the requirements for a nutrition-related degree are at your university, you might be able to swing it!   Here's another link to see what schools in your state offer DPDs!  http://www.eatrightacend.org/ACEND/content.aspx?id=10905  I think all dietetic internships require that you do a DPD so make sure and look into that. If you want to see what classes you would be taking in a DPD here is a link. Not all of the classes are going to be exactly the same, but this is a basic idea of what most programs will require. For instance, my university required all of these classes plus vitamins and minerals, energy and metabolism, statistics, and accounting.   http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/nutrition/dietetics/ms/40/didactic  Hope this helps! :)"

So enjoy your gelatine (which is very good for digestive system and in my experience has made my skin, nails and hair much better) and your extra flavour but don't kid yourself that you can replace eating fruits and veg and everything else that's good for you because somehow you think you're getting a load of minerals from the bones.  FWIW I make bone broth or stock as my family calls it because my parents have and their parents did before. Bones are tasty and it's a waste not to utilise them if you ask me. I also think there is probably some goodness in bones that we are not right now able to measure, and I'm a big fan of not just relying on muscle meats when it comes to animal products.

This was unexpected, but acetic acid is a weak acid, and the calcium phosphate in the bones is encased in collagen and other protective colloids which probably act as buffers and prevent the acid having any appreciable effect.   I haven't found anything about it making the extraction of Calcium worse, nor any experimental evidence on the extraction of the other minerals.  Should be an easy experiment to do, tho.

How much is it? I consider it cheap for its nutrition value. $2-$4 of bones gets you enough broth for 1-2 gallons of soup/rice/etc.  What type of bone to by? It really doesn't matter. I've tried beef bones, fish bones, oxtail and recently lamb bones. They each have a distinct flavor so I would try a few to find what you like.  How exactly do you buy it and make it? When buying meat at your butcher, meat department or farmers market, ask about soup bones or meat with bones on it. They don't always have it on display because it's not a popular item. I personally like to get meat with bone in it (ie lamb leg) to give my stews more sustenance. You can find many different cooking recommendations. For bone broth it's common to use a slow cooker or a cook in a covered pot over medium heat for 6+ hours. If you used small fish bones for your broth, you'll need to strain it when it's done cooking.

This adds up to -3500 per week, which is 1 pound of fat loss. As long as you do the math you'll see how much you're losing. A 1200 calorie minimum depends on your height and weight. Eating 1600 every four days instead of 1200 will only change how much you lose on a weekly basis. 3100 calories."

If you don't have trouble with hunger (e.g. I was 5'10"" 115 pounds at the start of severely reducing carbs), it just makes you hungry less often, but when you do eat you eat a lot more.

Even with a diet based on high fat foods eating primarily low-carb leafy vegetables and nuts / fatty fruits, you're going to be eating carbs (but much fewer refined carbs).

nutrition,39j7ci,HMNbean,2,Fri Jun 12 03:34:57 2015 UTC,Any sudden change of diet can cause you to have a reaction in some way or other. My guess is either:   the sudden change means your gut microbes aren't set up to digest it properly. You'll have a microbiome set up for your regular diet and one day of high protein isn't enough for the balance of bacteria to adapt. Lots of protein and low carbs can make you thirsty and require more water. You could need lots more water on days you have a higher protein intake.
nutrition,39j7ci,lovechip,2,Fri Jun 12 13:57:58 2015 UTC,I am not sure what exactly would cause it for you but the most common reasons I get headaches  Water - Have you decreased water intake since your drinking protein shakes now?  Shakes are not a substitute.  Allergies - What kind of protein are you taking?  Have you tried a different type?  I am not lactose intolerant but the frequency of my headaches reduced when I switched from whey/milk to egg/almond milk shakes.    Caffeine - Probably nothing to do with yours but I consume every day and if I go 12 hours without I will get a really dull headache that will not go away no matter how many pills I pop  Tension - Are you working out more?  If you started to lift weights look into neck stretches.  Even if you do not think your neck is tense you can be amazed at how tight the muscles are when you try different stretches.

However, the body maintains the pH of the blood (what actually matters) incredibly tightly using carbon dioxide (not calcium), so if it gets a little too acidic and you're still breathing, chances are you're fine.  If your kidneys and liver are messed up (e.g. you have uncontrolled diabetes), then maybe not.  The people you hear talking about the body's pH are talking about eating an alkaline diet, which increases the pH of your urine, but has no effect on the blood.  They'll also say crazy things like lemon is alkaline (it is on the urine), but is highly acidic, so not great for your teeth and it'll have no impact on the blood's pH.  What's funny is the whole pH thing is generally just a proxy for fiber.  More fiber = more alkaline urine and we all know veggies are good for you.

It has to do with the enzymes in our saliva. I'm not sure if actual food secretes different ones in the enzymes, but we produce more of it when we're eating. Typically one will spend 15-20 min eating to consume a meal, when a smoothie can be pounded in 5 min depending on how cold it is - so you'll miss out on the digestion benefits due to this.

nutrition,39cmlm,unpacked,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"Although I completely agree with the thrust of your comment (and your conclusion), it doesn't answer the original question.  That is to say, do grains / legumes / nuts affect your mineral absorption? The answer to that is yes, phytic acid reduces mineral absorption. It's just that this can be compensated for by sufficient intake of minerals in the first place. Phytic acid's ability to bind minerals and impair absorption is also thought to be part of the mechanism by which it exerts some beneficial effects (particularly by binding iron)."
nutrition,39cmlm,Insamity,9,Thu Jun 11 22:19:57 2015 UTC,Legumes and nuts affect your mineral absorption. I am not sure about grains but fiber in general reduces mineral absorption. But this is like less than 1% of total mineral intake so it is not something you need to worry about.
nutrition,39cmlm,fatal__flaw,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:40:55 2015 UTC,1% for fiber or 1% for all the foods you mentioned?   And any proof to your claim?
nutrition,39cmlm,only_spoons,4,Wed Jun 10 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"Fiber in foods you eat prevent some absorption of nutrients in those foods.  Basically part of the structure of those foods are made by carbohydrate chains that our bodies can't digest; called fiber.  Some of the minerals, sugars, and other nutrients are bound to it or encased in it.  Your body has a hard time separating nutrients from fiber so some go through your body undigested.  If you want proof, read biochemistry or organic chemistry books.  If you want people here to do the reasearch for you and point out passages in books for you, good luck with that.  If you react to dairy, grains and legumes, look up FODMAP and try a diet that minimizes or eliminates them."
nutrition,39cmlm,only_spoons,3,Thu Jun 11 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"Regardless of any measured effect on mineral absorption, it's very difficult to correlate actual consumption of grains and legumes with poor health. Time and time again legume consumption is particularly correlated with long healthy lives. Of course there are other factors at play here (other foods consumed, stress levels, lifestyle), but if they were actually a health risk you would expect their to be a somewhat different correlation.   There is actually evidence that stuff like phytates have benefits as well. So it seems most likely that  a diet with moderate amounts of grains and legumes and nuts will not have a negative effect on health. This may be different if it was all you ate or if the rest of your diet consisted of very refined foods."

People have been eating these foods for generations. Some of the longest lived healthiest people on the planet eat these foods. Why aren't they all sick and/or dying young? Overall health is a lot more complicated than eating one thing or not eating one thing. Eating legumes won't automatically make you unhealthy just as not eating them won't."

nutrition,39cmlm,Smartypantzzzz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:34:12 2015 UTC,That is a commonly related factoid but I don't actually know that it's true. I will relate my own personal experience  - since concentrating on pre and probiotics foods I can tolerate basically everything and feel much healthier overall. I also worked reallt hard on stress and sleep. I don't really eat grains much myself (genealogy rice or corn or millet if i do) but I'm a big one for legumes and eat nuts occasionally. Dairy I don't go out of my way for but I don't suffer if I eat a bit of ice cream or cook in butter or have some yoghurt .

nutrition,39cd9c,Azumiq,10,Wed Jun 10 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"This problem isn't so much in how much you eat, but in what composition of macro's you eat. I've had the same problem when I just started to work out.  The normal time you should be satiated from a meal is about 4-5 hours. When you experience hunger before that you have either not drunk enough water or your meal composition is off.  The information about the ultimate meal composition for you specifically (yes it's different for each person), I found in Paul Cheks - How to eat, move and be healthy and The Primal Pattern Diet - William Wollcot. Please refer to those books as they explain the principles better than my summary here in this comment.  Some people are more satiated by carbs, others by fats and proteins. You can check your meal yourself. If you had a carbheavy meal and you get hungry after 1 or 2 hours (given you drank enough water), you might want to add more fats like nuts, avocado or oils to your meal. How this is linked to the region where your ancestors lived is studied and explained in the books I referred.   Hope this helps you!"
nutrition,39cd9c,codestic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:36:36 2015 UTC,Very helpful! I will look into those books you mentioned.
nutrition,39cd9c,Azumiq,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"Also, while it is disproved that eating smaller meals is healthier for you in general, it can still help with the hunger. Take my girlfriend for instance, she eats around 1400 calories per day (mostly vegetarian, with the occasional chicken/salmon), but she eats it in around 4 to 6 meals. I am not the biggest fan of that, but if it works, why not.  Further, what helped me get over my hunger, was to accept the calories I ate. Calculate your BMR and know how many calories you really need (to reach your goal of weight loss/maintenance/weight gain) and stick with them. Separate between mental and physical hunger and understand how many calories you just ate. Knowing that I just ate 600 calories usually did the trick for me.  Carbs burn extremely fast which is why I'm trying to always pair them up with with lots of protein and fat, so they're worth it. You can't expect to eat a sandwich or two and not be hungry again in 2-3 hours, not gonna happen. Protein and fat burn significantly slower and therefore should part of almost every meal you eat.  Macros are really important, particularly if you eat ""processed"" foods. If you are a clean eater and mostly eat fruits, some bread (should be whole what) etc, this becomes less of an issue. But again, be carb aware (!). If you eat pasta or rice, eat a little pasta or rice with lots of veggies and homemade tomato sauce, with some olive oil or pesto (for the fat) and maybe some tofu cubes (for protein)."
nutrition,39cd9c,Tankat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:45:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your addition. I've tried the small meals too, but I tend to be in the kitchen too long for preparing the small meals and dont plan my meals ahead. Like you, the small meals just dont work for me.  A few things of note: The BMR calculation of your daily caloric intake might be a good guideline, but it's hardly accurate. The best way to keep track of your calories is by keeping track of your bodyweight weekly. But it takes consistence, so most people use the rough guidelines.  While you say that carbs burn extremely fast, it isn't true for all people. Some people, especially originated from around the equator, eat more carbheavy meals. Meals with double starches like potato and rice are very common here. These people dont digest meat effectively, making it rush through their system. On the contrary people from around the polar circle are used to eating whale blubber and fatty fish. They wont stay full very long on carbheavy meals.  If you are like you said a person who needs fats and proteins in their meal, you might be one of the polar or mixed metabolic types! :)  Good job figuring out you need to balance your Macro's dude! I needed a book to figure that one out."

For fullness try to maximize volume out of those calories. For instance things like juices, coffee with sugar, will consume calories but not leave you feeling satiated very long. Consider adding whole fruits which are mostly water (for volume), other good things would be high fiber cereal, oatmeal, etc."
nutrition,39cd9c,kookyyoshiro,3,Wed Jun 10 20:43:06 2015 UTC,I'm a body builder and this is what keeps me full in the morning.   Banana. Fast release carbs.   Oatmeal. Slow release carbs.   Cottage cheese. Slow release casein protein.   Protein shake. Fast release whey protein.   A good mix of energy sources is key for my body to build muscle and keep a constant source of energy.
nutrition,39cd9c,ciabattabing16,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:23:36 2015 UTC,"One or two eggs and wheat toast, ideally pop some avocado on that bread.  Like its been said, this all varies person to person. I'm vegetarian and am pretty physically active, so nothing will keep me full for more than a few hours. When I made the switch, I had to shift my focus from what my meals are to what my snacks are. What I found to work for me and other vegetarians and vegans I know is some in-between stuff to get you to the next big meal without making you binge once you get there. Possibilities:   Protein shakes Bars (I stick with Larabar and Cliff, but limit yourself to one a day because of high sugar content). Fruit - Whatever kind you like. Eat that shit. Nuts - A handful will do.   The goal should be that you don't go into your meals super hungry, and afterward you shouldn't feel all heavy and food coma-y."

Just toss them right in your freezer.    In the AM, mix a blender full of frozen fruit, soymilk, optional chunk of tofu for extra protein, peanut butter powder (this mixes better than regular pb but it's a bit pricier), a banana, and ground flax seed.  To help fill you up a bit more, sprinkle in some steel cut oats (this will make your smoothie a little chunkier, so you may not like the texture, try drinking it first and then add it to compare.  If you don't mind, you can also add chia seeds (more for nutrition but again, texture).  It tastes like ice cream, it's good for you, vegan, and it'll definitely fill you up.  Also, if you drink it on the go, like in the car or on the train, you're eating a bit later and you don't really notice."

They'll probably be easier to swallow than solid food, and they'll give you the calories and nutrients you need until you get your appetite back.  As for working out, I think you can cut yourself some slack for the first couple of weeks. You don't have the energy to work out if you're not eating or sleeping. You don't want to wait too long to get back into it, or it'll be that much harder to start again. But just be kind to yourself for now. It's only been a few days.  It will get better. {hugs}"

nutrition,39c0ip,youngblood51,2,Thu Jun 11 00:20:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, I lost a bunch of weight when my asshole of an ex boyfriend dumped me after 6 years together. For the first 2 weeks the only thing I could eat were apples in different forms (cut up, shredded, sauce, boiled, caramelized, you name it). I don't think I'll ever look at an apple the same way again. My parents were really worried about me, so they made me go to the doctor to make sure I didn't need antidepressants. Here are 3 things my doctor gave me as ""homework"" that helped me tremendously in getting back my appetite and overall routine:  1) Force yourself to eat an orange every morning before you eat anything else. Apparently, the citric nature of oranges makes you want more food to balance out the acidity, so if you start your morning with an orange  (in my case my doc also said to eat a bowl of cereal) you'll have more of an appetite later.   2) Sleep: keep all electronic devices outside your bedroom. DO NOT go on your phone right before you try to fall asleep, or keep your phone next to your bed. This will serve 3 purposes: you'll have to actually get up, out of bed to turn off your alarm in the morning; you won't creep your ex's profile or whatever right before bed (which would make you anxious, sad, etc and keep you from sleeping); and it'll allow you to be away from bright screens and lights right before you try to sleep. Also, don't allow yourself to nap during the day.   3) Exercise: 30-40 min of cardio every single day. This will really help you sleep better, be hungrier, motivate you to eat healthier, boost your mood and energy, and make you feel better about yourself. It's really hard to make yourself do it, I know, especially the first few times. Whenever I have really bad days of thinking about my ex, I just wanna stay home and cry, but I just have to force myself to get my workout in that day. Ask a friend or family member to go on a bike ride with you, a run, or even a fast walk.   It's been just over 3 months since my breakup, and I still go to my family doctor every other week to get an assessment and see if I need extra help (i.e., medication), and I also go to counseling every week. But these 3 things have made a huge difference!   It's really fucking hard, but you can do it! PM me if you want a motivational buddy :)"

One serving of wine is typically 5oz (148g) and is about 123 calories with an ABV of 9%â16% (most often 12.5%â14.5%). One serving of beer is typically 1 can (356g) and is 154 calories with ABV of 2%â12% (usually 4%â6%).

nutrition,39c4rl,thefightforgood,25,Thu Jun 11 11:27:29 2015 UTC,Alcohol is bad for you.  The higher the quantity the worse it is.  Alcohol is literally a poison that your liver has to filter out.  Alcohol is fun though and much of our society uses alcohol as a key ingredient to many social events.  Alcohol consumption in moderation isn't going to kill you and wont limit your fitness levels very much.  If your alcohol consumption is hurting your fitness goals you are drinking too much.  I think the most important thing to understand about nutrition is that moderation is key.  Eating/drinking too much of any one thing will be bad for you.  Keeping a variety in your diet and maintaining moderation in what you consume is more important than anything else.

As a male, when I'm in my health conscious mood I limit myself to two servings or less if I'm having a drink. When I indulge, it an be a lot but that's not too often anymore. In epidemiology studies light or moderate alcohol consumption is associated with longevity. It's empty calories but it may actually help in calorie restriction when consumed in moderation. The proposed mechanism for longevity is that it is a mTor antagonist. On the flip side it is also a carcinogen there is a clear dose dependent relationship between alcohol and cancers of the GI tract."

I drink a beer or three almost every day and probably too much on the weekends.  I've been going to the gym for around 8 years now without any long breaks.  If my nutrition is off, my training is off. I'm currently at around 8% bodyfat 185 @ 6ft tall.  Mid February I was 205 @ 15-18% bodyfat. I began lifting at a scrawny 6ft 125lbs. I've been on a cut for the past 3-4 months.  I didn't cut out drinking, I simply cut out breakfast and added more protein to my diet + cardio.  People here may down vote this because they think I'm a bad example, but the way I see it is this: as long as you can keep your shit together, stay consistent with your diet and training, alcohol included, then you can make changes as necessary week by week to figure out what you can and can't handle."

nutrition,39bsdk,avocator,10,Thu Jun 11 14:52:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who has taught cooking classes to children, I am begging you not to use a group camping trip to teach them their first cooking lessons.   Cooking with open-flame methods takes a lot more supervision than cooking in a traditional kitchen. Skills like using a knife are a lot harder for kids on uneven surfaces (a cutting board is unlikely to sit flush on a picnic table) and when they're in an environment that is more distracting. You want to involve kids in preparing meals that they have seen prepared in exactly the way they are going to help prepare them. Kids can get incredibly nervous about doing a task that they have never seen done before. Cooking for a group is incredibly stressful for kids because they worry (often rightly so) that their peers will judge them if they fail. Keep in mind that your oldest kids are nearly twice as old as your youngest ones. It takes pretty thorough planning to make sure that everyone has a job, that the job matches their skill level, and each kid is adequately supervised.   Instead of having the kids take ""ownership"" as a group for a single meal, I recommend having a few of them help the adults at each meal. Have each group be close in age. Rotate through so by the end of the trip, they've all helped at least once. Assign the ones who aren't cooking to setting and clearing the table and clean-up so there's no resentment about it being ""their turn"" to cook while their peers get a free meal and extra playtime."

I presume you've been a leader of this troop for a while and know the children.  If so, you know their personalities and potential conflicts.  I believe you'd be perfectly able to have them make one meal together without incident.  As far as suggestions, I believe I was in third grade before we personally cooked on campouts.  We ate easy things with little preparation- spaghetti and meat sauce, one pot stews, that type of thing.  I think your older kids can handle that.  For the first and possibly second graders, I suggest they create a snack like gorp (raisins, m&ms, cheerios, chex mix, whatever it has nowadays that doesn't cause allergic reactions) that the group shares.  That way they aren't really cooking, just mixing, but can be included with food prep."
nutrition,39bsdk,thefightforgood,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:30:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely some considerations to toss around. The Scouts are going through a big change this year, changing the program considerably. For instance: the cubs now have to memorize the Boy Scout Oath and Law, versus their own different version.  The bears, or third-graders, will be responsible for planning one of the pack's meals, making sure it is nutritious and balanced, doing the shopping, preparing the meal, and cleaning up after the meal.

There are plenty of easy soups that you can make and add almost anything to fit your nutrient needs along the process.  If you enjoy seafood, you can try incorporating fish into your diet both raw or cooked. Tuna/Salmon steaks are fairly easy to chew and sashimi is even easier.  You should still be able to eat a lot of vegetables as long as you steam them beforehand and even sautÃ©ing spinach/mushrooms/other stuff is a very quick and easy way to enjoy something nice.

How does restricting calories increase your risk of diabetes or cause your fat cells to double?  That's stupid.   Fad diets are good at making you lose fat really fast but in the long term they will actually just make you gain more weight.   I'm on a ""fad diet"".  It's called paleo and I started at 5'10"", 115 pounds (I'd been that weight for ~3 years), so quite obviously I was sick.  I put on 30 pounds in a year.    It's a fad because it cuts out processed foods.  Big freaking deal.  Clearly it's unhealthy because it's a fad.  A fad diet is simply a diet that demonizes a food (kind of like the China Study and Forks Over Knives demonizing meat and fat and all processed food.  They recommend an insane 10% fat diet if you're not up on it, though they never explicitly say it in the movies.    A fad diet isn't necessarily unhealthy.  It's just a bit non-standard relative to where you live.  Why is it a big deal that I don't drink milk?  3/4 of the world doesn't.  Why is it a big deal that you and I don't eat insects?  3/4 of the world does.   Stop telling people youâre on a diet. Instead tell people you have made a lifestyle change. Losing weight will have to be the result of slowly decreasing you caloric intake and putting your time in at the gym.  This has turned into an epidemic.   Why is it so simple for some people to maintain their weight, but so tooth and nails hard for others?    You act like it's a disease.  So I ask you, what changed in the last 50 years that brought about this disease?  Could it possibly be the introduction of excessive amounts of processed foods or the dramatic reduction in nutrient intake or the decrease in cooking at home from scratch or is it simply people are eating more because they're suddenly gluttons?  Why are they really eating more?  Ever sit next to an open bag of chips?  How hard is it to only have 5 chips?  How hard is it to not eat carrots that are right in front of you?"

Additionally a lot of fiber in the diet (especially if upped rapidly) may put a bit of stress on the colon and the gastrointestinal microbiome. However, greater amounts of plant-iron or lower amounts of heme-iron would biochemically equivalate to the same amount (given in correct ratio), which means that if you're going to eat vegan/vegetarian, you will have to take in a greater amount of iron from plants than you'd have to take in from animal sources to adequately nourish yourself.  Additionally, while I do think this is a case for the doctor, low ferritin is not anemia, which would be being deficient in hemoglobin, which is the last place the body would take iron from.

nutrition,399t0s,DaB0mb0,2,Wed Jun 10 09:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. Eat something with protein and fat for breakfast, and minimize your sugar intake.  A lot of people don't realize that most of the foods we consider 'breakfast foods' are really just sugary confections that don't belong in our diet at all. Pastries, dry cereals, doughnuts, anything drenched in maple syrup, etc. Breakfast food manufacturers have convinced us that these foods are ""part of a healthy breakfast"", but studies have proven that your body functions better in both the short and long term when you DON'T start your day with loads of sugar. Really, just think about it. You wake up, then ingest loads of sugar. Best case scenario, you have a strong insulin response and store the sugar as fat; blood sugar levels are still relatively high, so you crash in an hour or two unless if you increase your adrenaline levels by chugging coffee or caffeinated tea.  If you eat something high in fat for breakfast, although it may at first seem counterintuitive, you set yourself up for sustained energy and fat burning. You force the body to break down the fat in your food, training it to break down fat for energy. When it runs out of fat from your food, it'll just move right on to fat you've stored elsewhere in your body. Same difference. Eating protein in the morning also provides needed components to build/repair muscle, and since protein takes longer to break down into usable energy, provides you with a longer-lasting energy source.  I'm not a doctor, or a nutritionist, and I'm not going to take the time to find the relevant articles unless someone challenges me, but I'm convinced this is the truth. The less sugar and carbs you have in your breakfast, the closer you will be to your goal of increasing lean muscle mass.  Myself, I think the absolute best breakfast is eggs fried in butter with pork sausage and some sort of vegetable or fruit. If you really, really like your almond-raisin-oat cereal, and need to have a reminder of what your breakfast once was, keep eating the almonds. Those are a fine thing to eat; plenty of protein, fat, fiber, and calorie-dense, so you'll be eating at a surplus and be able to gain weight.  Edit. Had to add, your cereal is 40% sugar (i.e. glucose/sucrose/fructose). Pure, unadulterated sugar. Then, there's lots of carbs, which are easily metabolized into sugar as well. So, you should probably consider that cereal to be more like 60-80% sugar."

And to gain muscle you just need to be getting a decent amount of protein, which you most likely already are.   I prefer cronometer because I'm interested in the nutrients in my food, but mfp is a much more polished app. They both log exercise.

It's both a quantity issue at the level of the lactose ingested and the level of enzyme produced, but for most it's more so the amount of lactose ingested.  I'm lactose intolerant but can eat cheese, it's 1 g per serving vs. 12 g per serving so the relative osmotic effect if it's not digested is negligible for cheese vs. milk. As for milk, much of the lactose is digested by the bacteria so the lactose content is actually lower than listed."

Moreover, most products contain only a fraction of whole grains. They are terrible food with a glycemic index rivaling or surpassing that of table sugar. It is best to simply drop them, or possibly substitute them with root vegetables or berries that have much, much lower glycemic index and higher nutrients for the same amount of calories. Seriously people, stop eating bread, it's one of the most processed food items on the world. Fiber supplementation without the nutrients found in vegetables and fruits have negligible health impact. They increase fecal size matter, which is unnecessary in most cases, and that's all. They won't save you from the adverse effects of a diet rich in refined carbohydrates. Flax seeds and walnuts contain ALA that does not fully share the beneficial effect of EPA & DHA on heart disease and cognition. Partly due to the very inefficient conversion into EPA, partly due to competitive inhibition of the same enzyme that is responsible for converting EPA into DHA. Almonds and soy have a lot of omega 6 fatty acids. You absolutely have to keep your omega 6 intake in check. Flax seeds and soy are very rich in phytoestrogens. They have clear hormonal activity at excessive consumption, which is apparently very easy to reach. Apples are nutritionally void. Garlic contains HDAC inhibitors. HDAC inhibition has both positive and negative effects. Of the negatives, it might interfere with electrolyte homeostasis and working memory. They are too widely acting in my opinion. Mind you that garlic might not have the dose for active inhibition.   I am not familiar with oats and beans, so I can not comment on those."

Though PREDIMED was not airtight, these results are intervention based and favor a provegetarian dietary pattern, as opposed to Western dietary pattern.  There are also ongoing studies. Full fat animal-based foods, when consumed in excess (such as in Western dietary patterns), can negatively impact cardiovascular outcomes. When consumed in moderation and in concert with other healthful dietary components (olive oil, nuts) full fat animal products have been shown as beneficial.   Omega-6 is currently under the scientific microscope. However, the jury is still out. Wu et al found that lowest risk of CHD mortality was seen with higher levels of circulated n-6 and n-3 PUFA."
nutrition,398qtt,FrigoCoder,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"""Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet"" - Is this the one?  I found a critique titled ""Did the PREDIMED Trial Test a Mediterranean Diet?"" that claims all groups had similar 9% saturated fat intake, and the Mediterranean diets had higher overall fat intake, along with higher intakes of monounsaturated fat, omega 3 polyunsaturated fats, and polyphenols.  I could not find carbohydrate and protein intakes unfortunately. However I could infer from the listed foods that the low fat diet did indeed contain more carbohydrates and possibly less protein: Low-fat dairy products, bread, potatos, pasta, rice, fruits were encouraged on the low fat diet, with no restriction on soda drinks, whereas of these only fruits were encouraged along with white meat on the mediterranean diet, with explicit restriction on soda drinks.  So basically what we have right here is a comparison between higher fat, lower carb diets with a balanced fatty acid profile, and a low fat, high carb diet with an unbalanced fatty acid profile, and the same rates of saturated fat.  In essence, they replaced carbohydrates with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and possibly protein.  In light of this, this study isn't really supportive of vegetarian diets. Rather, it suggests replacement of carbohydrates with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and possibly protein. Or replacement of grains with olive oil, nuts, fish, and possibly white meat. This I can fully agree with!  I wonder if they would have arrived at the same results by replacing carbohydrates with saturated fat, and only the bare minimum of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Probably not, a balanced fatty acid profile and polyphenols might have shown their edge.   The reduction in cardiovascular disease was most evident for stroke, an outcome that is exceedingly dependent on blood pressure. This result is concordant with those of observational studies, which have shown that Mediterranean-style diets and olive oil are associated with reduced risk of stroke.   If you restrict dietary carbohydrates and substitute them with fat, blood pressure is going to drop for at least three reasons:   Salt absorption is less efficient in the absence of sugar and possibly other carbohydrates. This is one of the reasons sports drinks contain sugar. There is less liver glycogen to buffer water and electrolytes. There is less insulin to trigger the insulin-dependent sodium reabsorption in the kidneys.   These are the reason why people on the ketogenic diet are advised to supplement 5-7 grams of table salt a day, possibly more. That diet absolutely minimizes sodium retention. Urinary sodium excretion can reach 5 grams, and this does not take into account the sodium lost through sweat."

This is achieved by providing fluids that are absorbed rapidly and that the athlete finds palatable, and by proving time for drinking.  Athletes should start drinking before sensing thirst and continue to drink at regular intervals.

The term Warburg effect describes the observation that cancer cells, and many cells grown in-vitro, exhibit glucose fermentation even when enough oxygen is present to properly respire. In other words, instead of fully respiring in the presence of adequate oxygen, cancer cells ferment. The Warburg hypothesis was that the Warburg effect was the root cause of cancer. The current popular opinion is that cancer cells ferment glucose while keeping up the same level of respiration that was present before the process of carcinogenesis, and thus the Warburg effect would be defined as the observation that cancer cells exhibit glycolysis with lactate secretion and mitochondrial respiration even in the presence of oxygen.

nutrition,3996it,SunShineImaDine,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:53:08 2015 UTC,"To a degree, animal products in general help progress a cancer much more rapidly when compared to a plant based diet. There have also been studies where the difference between a plant based diet and an animal product diet affected cancer rates dramatically in rats exposed to aflatoxin. The plant based rats had 0 cancer growth, while the animal based rats had tremendous cancer progression. Aflatoxin btw is one of the most carcinogenic chemicals in the world. So animal products don't ""cause"" cancer, but they allow it to progress"
nutrition,3996it,billsil,6,Wed Jun 10 06:07:41 2015 UTC,"The plant based rats had 0 cancer growth, while the animal based rats had tremendous cancer progression.    They also died sooner.  Also, they were literally being poisoned by molds that are commonly found in peanuts and grains, not meat.   The paper from India that Campbell found is called The Effect of Dietary Protein on Carcinogenesis of Aflatoxin, which appeared in the Archives of Pathology in 1968. Indeed, the researchers discovered that rats fed 5% of their diet as casein were generally free from cancerous growths, whereas the rats fed 20% casein were riddled with âem. But at the 16:37-minute mark, we get to see a snippet of this paper that shows us something equally important:   Donât get distracted by those red letters! What weâre interested in is the sentence near the bottom, which the filmâs producers apparently didnât notice: âIn all, 30 rats on the high-protein diet and 12 on the low-protein diet survived for more than a year.â   Let that sink in for a moment. Maybe itâll hit a little harder if I told you that in the âhigh protein vs. low proteinâ experiments discussed in this paper, 10 low-protein rats died prematurely while all the high-protein rats stayed alive. In other words, the overall survival rate for the 20% casein group was much better than for the 5% casein group, despite the fact they had liver tumors. The low-protein rats were dying rapidlyâjust not from liver cancer. And as weâll see later, the reason the non-dead, low-protein rats didnât get tumors was partly because their liver cells were committing mass suicide.    http://rawfoodsos.com/2011/09/22/forks-over-knives-is-the-science-legit-a-review-and-critique/  Furthermore, this isn't even an issue of plant-based protein vs. animal protein.  It's a complete protein vs. a protein deficient diet.  If you don't feed the rats isolated food-like nutrients you can't even eat a diet like that.  The wheat fed rats ate a lysine deficient diet.  Also, Campbell cheated very badly.   Campbell tells us on page 59 of The China Study that plant proteins act fundamentally differently than animal proteins.  Gluten, the protein of wheat, did not promote cancer, while casein, the protein of milk, promoted it powerfully.  This study (7), however, showed that gluten was just as powerful as casein when lysine, its limiting amino acid, was provided.  Campbell never tells us this in The China Study. Nor does he tell us that casein is just as much an incomplete protein as gluten and that the reason it proved so effective in promoting cancer in his models was because he supplemented all of the diets with methionine.  Caseinâs limiting amino acids are methionine and cysteine, which can be converted into one another.  Thus methionine or cysteine make casein complete in the same way that lysine makes wheat protein complete.  [I]n 1945 Larsen and Heston found that the incidence of spontaneous pulmonary tumors was doubled in strain A mice fed low-casein diets supplemented with cystine (the most limiting amino acid).  Silverstone and Tannenbaum (14) showed that the development of spontaneous hepatomas was enhanced in C3H mice fed a gelatin-containing diet when methionine and cystine were added.  A review of the somewhat limited data from these and earlier studies (1) indicated that inhibition of tumor development as a result of marginal intakes of various proteins could be abolished by supplementation with the respective limiting amino acid for each protein. . . . [O]ur results suggest that the enhancement of focus development by lysine supplementation of gluten is due to a general improvement in dietary protein quality and not to any particular metabolic effect peculiar to lysine. This conclusion is supported by previous work (1, 12-14) showing that various low-quality proteins are better able to enhance tumor development when they are supplemented with the amino acid in greatest deficit.   http://www.westonaprice.org/blogs/cmasterjohn/the-curious-case-of-campbells-rats-does-protein-deficiency-prevent-cancer/"

nutrition,3996it,billsil,2,Wed Jun 10 07:38:33 2015 UTC,"I see nothing to strongly suggest either a high protein or low protein diet is more effective at preventing cancer growth.  I think an adequate protein diet is probably as good as a high protein diet, but I'd avoid anything lower than 10% of calories.  I think 10-20% is fine, maybe higher.  I think cancer largely comes down to your environment (pollution), your diet (avoiding processed food, booze, smoking, maintaining a healthy weight), and being happy, exercising, and getting outside into nature.  I also think the occasional fast is hugely important for preventing cancer.  Everyone has heard the statement that a high stress job/relationship causes cancer.  I believe that, but that doesn't mean stress is bad.  Unmanaged stress is bad."

nutrition,3977v5,anbeav,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:02:52 2015 UTC,"At 3,000kcal, I'd feel pretty satisfied either way.  I tend to only need around 2100kcal in a day, where 2500-2700 is nice for slowly gaining weight / lean mass.  With lots of sugar / fructose, there's some leptin resistance and insulin to deal with where I tend to need to eat more often to feel comfortable (4 meals would be nice, 6 just seems excessive.)  With greater amounts of fat / starches, two 1500kcal meals would work well with a comfortable 6-12hr gap between breakfast-dinner and a 16-18hr gap between dinner-breakfast and no real feelings of hunger.  I can usually throw better meals together if I'm only eating twice in a day than if I'm eating 3 or more meals (more time to prep and more room in my stomach for awesome meals.)  On smaller caloric intakes at a deficit, I tend to find 3 meals works better than 2, although if the caloric intake is low enough to approach fasting territory, it's easier for me to just throw in a 24hr fast (eat an early dinner, then eat a late brunch the next day) than to eat a small meal or do frequently snacking."

nutrition,396hen,Adolf-Phin,2,Wed Jun 10 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"From the studies, it's difficult to tell what eating a bit of red meat from a healthy animal that roamed around eating a nutritious natural diet will do for your health (over the top of a nutritious whole foods plant-heavy diet).  In a lot of the surveys used to create this negative association with red meat, you're looking at guys who eat a ton of stuff like processed meats and fast food burgers, where they're frying confined-animal-farmed gmo grain-fed cheap meat up in reused soybean and peanut oil (generating things like AGEs / HCAs / PAHs / oxidized PUFAs) over buns with all sorts of odd chemicals and preservatives / texture enhancers / flavor enhancers with a side of large fries and large high fructose sodas.  Those who tend to follow nutritional guidelines to eat a healthier diet with less meat tend to subscribe to a healthier lifestyle with better education and socioeconomic status.  Going for a whole foods rich diet, the overall mortality tends to look about the same in vegetarians and nonvegetarians.  In this study, red meat consumption was not statistically associated with increased mortality.  In fact, it found a slight J-shaped association with the lowest risk among subjects with low-to-moderate meat consumption, which was observed for red meat and poultry.  In this study, mortality for major causes of death was not significantly different between vegetarians and nonvegetarians.  Comparing vegetarians with nonvegetarians, the death rate ratios from the studies were 1.03, 1.01, and 1.05.  This study found mortality was not significantly lower among vegetarians for any of the causes of death studied, although higher mortality among vegetarians for breast cancer in women and for mental and neurological diseases were reported.  In this study, the incidence of colorectal cancer was higher in vegetarians than in meat eaters.  In this study, mortality from ischemic heart disease among the vegans was slightly higher than among the fish eaters.  The death rate ratio for the vegans compared with the regular meat eaters was 1.06 for all causes and 1.39 for other causes.   Among vegetarians who had followed their current diet for <5 y, mortality was significantly higher than that in nonvegetarians from lung cancer, other causes, and all causes.  Further analyses were conducted to examine the increases in mortality in vegetarians who had followed their current diet for â¤5 y. These analyses showed that the increases in mortality from all other causes and from all causes of death were observed in all 5 studies."

How much less? It is impossible for me to say since I don't have enough information about you.   I recommend you start using a calorie counter (I recommend MyFitnessPal, Myplate, and Fat Secret) to log your daily intake of food. Also, I suggest you set the activity level in the calorie counter you choose to ""sedentary"" to start with. This will give you a decent idea on how many calories you should consume daily. If you find you are gaining weight, simply lower to daily intake in the settings of the calorie counter you are using by a couple hundred calories or so."

Romaine, chickpeas, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and avocado.  2. Kale leaves rubbed with mix of tahini, lemon juice, garlic, chili flakes s&p.  Favorite dinner is marinated portobello mushrooms, mashed cauliflower (made with bullion or just s&p) and side of greens.

The recent sugar guidelines refer to these added sugars, so whole fruits are considered more as your overall carbohydrate intake.   It always depends on your overall diet though â if youâre eating loads of fruit on top of other sugary foods, then your total sugar intake is probably quite high. It also depends just how much youâre going over your sugar limit â this could mean youâre getting less foods from other groups or going over your calorie allowance.   It comes down to everything in moderation â fruit can be a healthy, nutritious part of your diet but there are lots of other aspects that are also important so you need to look at your overall intake and not just focus on one nutrient. If instead of the fruit youâd be eating more processed foods or something like that, then fruit is definitely a better option."

You are better off though eating a tone of veggies rather than fruit.  Yes you will seem to lose weight faster on a no carb diet but so what.

Your body needs those 300 calories and will pull reserves from your adipose tissue to make sure your body cells have energy to burn.  Now, if you want to be healthy, and have good energy levels while losing weight you should not be eating Oreo's.  You need a good blend of proteins, carbs(that includes sugars from fruit), and fats.  You do need to consume fats, and natural sugars are the greatest form of energy you can eat.  Just stay away from trans fats, and added sugars that are not naturally in the food you're consuming.

That said, here is some basic info that's out there.  The livestrong website has articles from information taken right from well trusted institutions like the CDC, and the Institute of Medicine  Your goal is to lose weight, so the most important numbers you need to figure out is how many calories you are consuming from eating, and how many calories you are burning every day.  Once you figure those out, make sure that the amount you eat is lower than that amount you burn by a couple of hundred.  Do that every day until you're at the weight you want to be.  Keep in mind that as you lose weight your metabolic rate will drop and you will need to gradually lower your caloric intake.   in terms of how much fruit is too much.  You need to make sure you are getting the right amount of protein first.  A typical healthy adult should eat 0.8-1 gram protein for every kilogram they weigh.  A kilogram is 2.2 pounds so if you weigh 180 pounds you weigh about 82kg and should consume around that many grams of protein every day.  That's only about 360-400 calories so you still need to fill in the rest of you days diet with carbs and fats.

You haven't exactly asked me for advice and will be seeing a nutritionist but I have a couple easy hints that I've found helpful.  Do you like fizzy drinks?  Swap it out for fizzy flavored water as long as there is no added sweetener.  I like Perrier but it can be spendy.  Schwepp's Black Cherry is about the most carbonated thing you will ever drink and if you get it in a can it's flavor heaven.  Talking Rain isn't as good but it's OK and cheap so you can by a 2 liter and go to town on a hot day.  In general though, drink lots of water.  I keep a water bottle with me at all times and end up usually drinking much more than the recommended 64 ounces.  Coffee.  It's fine unless you love it like I do with lots of cream and then it's hell on portion control.  For a treat that's fine but for a daily warm beverage try green tea or any other kind of tea.  I like Pu-Erh (which is an acquired taste) and Oolong and Jasmine and so forth.  I keep a variety in my cupboard/desk.  Like savory snack like potato chips?  Swap them out for kale chips, salted roasted seaweed, or roasted chick peas.  I also like to substitute raw vegetables for a game time snack and use hummus or I mix ranch powder into Fage Greek Yogurt.  Fage is awesome but the 0% fat tastes like shit to me.  Learn to cook if you don't know how.  Nothing fancy is necessary.  I make a meat slop once a week that provides 5 dinners (10+ cups) and I can season it like chilli or curry or Italian.  High protein, low fat, high carb in the form of vegetables.  Then I make another 10+ cups of some soup like lentil or Tuscan Bean.  Anything to add in other veggies and sources of protein that I don't get from my slop.  I keep some canned sardines in water or smoked kippers to mix with cottage cheese before bed if I am feeling peckish.  That extra 250 calories will not kill you if you walked for a half hour that day.  Again I know you didn't ask me for all that crap but I'm excited for you.  It is a great foray into healthy living and I know how fun that can be.  Just beware of all sorts of misinformation.  If your nutritionist tells you that salt and saturated fat and cholesterol are the devil then you may want to seek advice elsewhere soon.  Also feel free to treat yourself once in a while.  I love pizza and sometimes let myself have it if it's a special occasion or I am just dying of the cravings and yet have been reaching my goals.  Best of luck to you.  Keep a journal and get a kitchen scale."

nutrition,397qg7,umumgowa,4,Tue Jun 9 21:26:58 2015 UTC,"A low fat diet is usually classified as <30% energy from fat.  At 2,000kcal, this would be < 67g of fat.  For a 3,000kcal diet, less than 50g of fat is considered a very low fat diet at <15% energy from fat.  I wouldn't really worry about the amount while you're in double digits and on a low fat, bordering on very low fat diet.  Guys in /r/keto and /r/paleo are healthy in the triple digits, and mediterranean diets tend to show benefits (particularly cardiovascular health) over a low fat diet at over 40% energy from fat (90-130g of fat).  You might look into your unsaturated:saturated ratio, total grams of pufa, and n-6:n3 ratios.  But these tend to become more valuable metrics into the higher intakes.  Meta-analysis comparing Mediterranean to low-fat diets for modification of cardiovascular risk factors:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/featuredreviews/mediterraneandiet-2012/   Mediterranean diets appeared to be more effective than low-fat diets in inducing clinically relevant long-term changes in cardiovascular risk factors.   Mediterranean diet: Higher fat but lower risk: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891943/   This study indicates that a Mediterranean diet, with increased intake of either olive oil or mixed nuts, is more protective against CVD than a recommended low-fat diet.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518752  The effects of the mediterranean diet on biomarkers of vascular wall inflammation and plaque vulnerability in subjects with high risk for cardiovascular disease. A randomized trial: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925270   Compared to participants in the low-fat diet group, those receiving MD+EVOO and MD+Nuts showed a higher decrease in systolic (6mmHg) and diastolic (3mmHg) blood pressure (P = 0.02; both), as well as a reduction of 10% and 8% in LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.04), respectively. Patients in the MD+Nuts group showed a significant reduction of 34% in CD40 expression on monocyte surface compared to low-fat diet patients (P = 0.03). In addition, inflammatory biomarkers related to plaque instability such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were reduced by 45% and 35% and 95% and 90% in the MD+EVOO and MD+Nuts groups, respectively (P<0.05; all) compared to the low-fat diet group. Likewise, sICAM and P-selectin were also reduced by 50% and 27%, respectively in the MD+EVOO group (P = 0.04) and P-selectin by 19% in MD+Nuts group (P = 0.04) compared to the low-fat diet group.   The Medi-RIVAGE study: reduction of cardiovascular disease risk factors after a 3-mo intervention with a Mediterranean-type diet or a low-fat diet.: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280426   Our data predicted a 9% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk with the low-fat diet and a 15% reduction with this particular Mediterranean diet.   Comparing Low-Fat and Low-Carbohydrate Diets: http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1900692   Overall, blood levels of certain fats that are predictors of risk for cardiovascular disease also decreased more in the low-carbohydrate group.    Effects of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets: a randomized trial:   The low-carbohydrate diet was more effective for weight loss and cardiovascular risk factor reduction than the low-fat diet. Restricting carbohydrate may be an option for persons seeking to lose weight and reduce cardiovascular risk factors.   The cardiometabolic consequences of replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates or Î©-6 polyunsaturated fats: Do the dietary guidelines have it wrong?: http://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000032.full   The potential harms of replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates: Increase in small, dense LDL particles.  Shift to an overall atherogenic lipid profile (lower HDL-C, increase in triglycerides and an increase in the ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio). Smaller improvements in glucose tolerance, body fatness, weight, inflammation and thrombogenic markers. Increased incidence of diabetes and obesity. The potential harms of replacing saturated fat with omega-6 polyunsaturated fats: Increased risk of cancer. Increased risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular events, death due to heart disease and overall mortality. Increased oxidised LDL-C. Reduction in HDL-C.   Diets to Prevent Coronary Heart Disease 1957-2013: What Have We Learned?: http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(13)01111-X/fulltext#sec12   Nearly all clinical trials in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s compared usual diets with those characterized by low total fat, low saturated fat, low dietary cholesterol, and increased polyunsaturated fats. Free-living volunteers were able to adhere to these diets whose goal was to decrease serum cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular events. These diets did reduce cholesterol levels. However, they did not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease deaths.   It is clear that dietary patterns consistent with the traditional Mediterranean-style diet are particularly cardioprotective.  Nutritional interventions have proven that a âwhole dietâ approach with equal attention to what is consumed and what is excluded is more effective in preventing cardiovascular disease than low-fat, low-cholesterol diets.   Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of cardiovascular disease: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16467234   Reduced total fat intake and increased intakes of vegetables, fruits, and grains did not significantly reduce the risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD    Worsened arterial stiffness in high-risk cardiovascular patients with high habitual carbohydrate intake: a cross-sectional vascular function study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3948104/   High dietary carbohydrate intake is associated with increased cardiovascular risk through raised triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels   Are refined carbohydrates worse than saturated fat?: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869506/   Multivariate analyses showed that saturated fat intake was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction compared with carbohydrate consumptionâa finding consistent with the results from a recent pooled analysis and a meta-analysis. However, replacement of saturated fat with high-GI-value carbohydrates significantly increased the risk of myocardial infarction"

nutrition,397qg7,folderol,2,Tue Jun 9 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"Well it's somewhere around 90% of calories where it starts getting in the way of protein intake, and by extension, start causing health complications and stunted growth.  Lower limit is 30% to maintain hormone production. You actually need saturated fat for that, although I do not know the exact percentage.  Fat is not a concern unless you also consume excess carbohydrates. Even then only a few types of saturated fatty acids are problematic, and less so than the carbohydrates themselves."

nutrition,394fx6,B00617825,4,Tue Jun 9 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"Cutting out soda is a must. That will help the feeling like crap after eating. I find fresh food cheaper than processed foods but you have to get to the point of eating them before processed foods so they don't go bad.  I started with no soda and sugar under 24g. I didn't like vegetables so I would eat a lot of cucumbers and carrots. I also made it a point to add as much fresh spinach to any meal I had, i.e. eggs, sandwiches, tacos etc. After awhile I was able to eat vegetables and just began experimenting.   If you succeed and get yourself off processed foods your taste buds change and food is amazing and it all tastes so different.   Oh for sugar, if it has added sugar to the ingredients, that's what I count. If there is not added sugar, that usually means it has the fiber to process the sugar. Something I was also just recently told is that fruit is for cleansing and vegetables are for building up your body. Hope this all helps. I'm still on the road to healthy myself. Goodluck!"
nutrition,394fx6,ISFJismytype,2,Tue Jun 9 04:57:57 2015 UTC,"You don't need to spend a lot of money to eat healthy. Simply switching soda to water will cut out a TON of calories and sugar. You can buy large packages of chicken breasts for cheap that you can cook on any stove. For carbs stick to brown rice which is super simple to make and veggies. Buying those frozen steamer veggie bags from the grocery store are the simplest way to go; you can just microwave them. Finally, for some low calorie; high protein foods I recommend Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Just mix in fruit or granola and it actually tastes pretty good. Good luck on changing your diet!"

nutrition,394fx6,Festyballs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:26:32 2015 UTC,"The key for you is to make sustainable changes that are easy to stick to. Don't make it difficult and don't aim for perfect with any habit. Have a look at the following two tedx talks that are about behavioural change for weight loss. In theory weight loss and being healthier is easy but actually getting ourselves to carry out those behaviours can be the stumbling block. These talks give you some good strategies:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWfqBy4sSD8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8  Then, choose 1 thing to improve.  My suggestion would be starting with Pepsi. Swap to diet Pepsi or aim to have Pepsi every other day. Pick something that feels doable. If you find yourself failing to stick to it, make the change smaller until you stick at it.  Stick at that habit for at least 2 weeks. Then choose 1 thing to improve. Notice I say 'improve' rather than 'fix'. Don't aim to introduce a perfect habit, go for a small improvement. E.g. instead of going from Pepsi to filtered water, go for a middle ground as I suggested above.   Remember that motivation is for short term tasks. Weight loss and then maintenance is not a short term task and won't work using motivation. For long-term tasks you need solid, daily habits and routines.  In terms of where you should be steering your diet, it is ideally towards natural, unprocessed foods, lots of veg, pulses, full fat dairy products, high quality meats, some wholegrains if you feel you need it (i do, minimally because I cannot bear the texture of foods that are just meat and veg based! But that's my own weirdness).   Remember to add things into your diet rather than just taking them away. For example, I began buying a punnet of raspberries once a week. I really enjoy them and they're nutritious. Then I added in a pack of smoked salmon every week.   Don't aim too high initially, just tiny steps that you can sustain.  Hope this helps! :D"

nutrition,391syb,Barnsalot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"There are two things you want to look at here;   Total calories Ratio of simple sugars to more complex carbohydrates.   If you are drinking the same amount of each (2pints we'll say), and the heineken has 400Kcal/2pints, and the Strongbow is 500Kcal/2pints (or reverse the caloric counts), then you will end up gaining more weight and 'belly fat' with the one that has the greater amount of calories.  Looking at it from a sugar vs. total nutrition content, whichever one has the greatest amount of free sugars should have a higher GI value, and it will likely leave you feeling emptier, sooner. This can lead to increased food/drink consumption and again, greater weight gain with greater caloric consumption.  If they are otherwise identical in calories, and you can consume the same amount without altering the rest of your diet, then you shouldn't see any significant difference in weight accumulation/change.

It is a strange diet because itâs completely individual really, and just about finding the things that set you off personally, so I think recipes for it are useful for finding ideas and then adjusting to preference. It also overlaps with other diets like gluten or lactose free, so low FODMAP recipes would likely be useful for a range of people with intolerances etc."

Mushrooms and cauliflower wreak me.    A low FODMAP diet is meant as a starting point, but you're expected to reintroduce foods.  Still, a lot of the FODMAP issue has to do with preparation.  Boiling my food for a decent amount of time goes a long way to letting me eat almost whatever I want.

All the fighting over Paleos, vegans, raw, etc..is nonsense. We are all so different. Certain foods do different things to different people. What causes inflammation in one person, doesn't in another.   I'm not a nutritionist, I'm just a writer in the field of nutrition. I research diets. I recently took a trip all around the U.S. to study nutrition in relation to chronic illness. I spoke to a lot of doctors. I asked them what diets they recommend.   They all said the same thing: the Mediterranean diet is the best we have.   This is in regards to people with chronic illness. But you are also looking for longevity.  I myself have a chronic illness. The nutrition therapies I have looked at have been mostly absurd, but had some good points to them. What I did was to take what I liked from a few different diets.  I eat a lot of raw foods/produce, I cook a lot of vegan recipes, but I also eat wild fish. I don't eat processed foods, but I will make an unhealthy dessert from time to time. I use a lot of oils. Fresh, wild fish is expensive - so I'm primarily vegetarian. But I'll piss off someone if I use any labels. I juice occasionally.   I'm a scribblessdtarian. Make up your own. Seriously, it's all we can do. But I do agree that Mediterranean is great. For me. Use it as a jumping off point."
nutrition,392ej9,anbeav,3,Wed Jun 10 05:34:16 2015 UTC,"Nutrition is a very young science. Studying food and its effects in humans is very hard. Most of the studies that people use to promote their diets are based on observational studies and they are prone to error. Because they don't happen in a controlled environment, other variables could be responsible for the effects.  Ideally you will lock two groups of people with similar traits in a metabolic ward to study the effect of ""x"" diet on ""y"" condition. You will have to keep people there for decades as you wait for them to develop diseases and see of what they die . Not a practical nor ethical thing to do. Because observational studies are easy and cheap, most news and articles that said this is good for you today and tomorrow bad comes from there.  There is also the issue of the placebo. Most  studies requires blinding to avoid bias and you cannot do this with food because people will know what they are eating. The expectation that a certain food will be ""healthy"" or ""bad"" could alter the results.  We also don't eat food in isolation. Combining certain foods can alter their effects on health. I could go on but think you get the point by now.  If you study the dietary habits of people around the planet you will find that human beings can thrive in very different diets. You can also find some common ground in which almost everyone agrees like the dangers of trans-fats, avoiding drinking in excess and processed food, eating a balance diet, the importance of sleeping well and exercise.  If you are serious about becoming a personal trainer, learn how to differentiate good science from junk science and how to interpret the results of a scientific paper. Test different things and see what works for you better and that you can sustain for the long term."

You should spread the sources out due to acidity levels in meats. Veggies and legumes neutralize everything supposedly.   Being that beans and other legumes have a decent protein make up, it makes sense to eat them.  Also, there's studies showing that too much protein in general is cancerous and bad in many other ways. It's even worse with protein from meat.  Again,  I'm not making these claims."
nutrition,392ej9,anbeav,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:35:12 2015 UTC,"You should spread the sources out due to acidity levels in meats. Veggies and legumes neutralize everything supposedly.   Hmm, I don't think that's a thing.  Oats have a PRAL score of around 13.0.  Brown rice has a score around 7.5.  Lentils have a score around 3.5.  These are all acidic foods.  An egg white has a score around 1.1.  Whole milk has a score around 1.1.  Whey protein is alkaline at -1.6.  If you're really looking into your ""ph balance"", it's probably worth averaging out the meal when looking at it -- if your diet includes 4lbs of plants, are you really edging toward acidity by supplying the adequate intake of protein from natural sources of proteins?  Humans are omnivores and develop disease when placed on a vegan whole foods diet (see b12 deficiency, for example.)  With the exception of soy protein, most beans and legumes score fairly poorly on the PDCAAS chart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Digestibility_Corrected_Amino_Acid_Score   It's even worse with protein from meat.   It depends on how you want to interpret the studies, for example ""when we look solely at the variable 'death from all cancers,' the association with plant protein is +12. With animal protein, itâs only +3.""  In other studies you can extend longevity with supplementing animal protein (glycine / gelatin) to the same extent as calorie restriction and methionine restriction.  In many of the studies, animal protein consumption is also associated with smoking / overeating / lack of exercise, and being a generally unhealthy person with bad habits, where as vegetarians eating properly prepared legumes tend be more health conscious.  Grains / legumes are decent for diversity / flavor, but they're not really performance enhancing superfoods required by athletes.. they're not even that nutritious -- they are rich in anti-nutrients compared with most other plants / meats you could eat."

A defecit of about 500 calories per day ends up being bout 1 lb a week. But if you have been doing this for awhile, the body begins to rebel and holds onto its fat stores as one gets to about 10-12% body fat. Its an interesting paradox. As you lose weight, your body adapts by lowering your metabolism(overtime). So about every 5 pounds lost, you need to re evaluate your diet and the amount of calories needed. Your currently at about -500 calories from you TDEE so I wouldn't worry. Eventually everyone will stall although it varies from person to person.

Rice, Stir fry sauce  (I really like SoyVay products, esp Hoisin Garlic), Maybe some shrimp  For salads I would go with a spring mix, add cut up chicken breast pieces, red onion, avocado, cherub tomatoes, almonds, cranberries, maybe some blue cheese.  If you like sandwiches when you're busy or on the go, I like to use Ezekiel  Bread, 100-120 grams of sliced turkey and a slice or 2 of cheese (muenster, sharp cheddar, etc) I don't really bother putting veggies on my sandwiches, they just get soggy. Some lettuce works well though.  Dinner:  Steak (if you eat red meat, I dont), chicken breast, potato (baked is always good), mash em if you've got the patience, maybe some peas or beans.  I tend to eat simple meals that are easy to fix, unless my wife is cooking for the both of us, in which case I just chow down on whatever deliciousness she comes up with. So I eat a lot of eggs and oatmeal for breakfast, chicken breast and veggies for lunch, chicken salad for dinner, with protein packed sandwiches and fruit/nuts to snack on.

That'll easily be an 800 calorie breakfast with lots of good stuff.

The horrible truth about whey is that you rarely get the advertised protein amounts, there was a study recently which showed that even the top rated whey powders don't contain the amounts listed, so I just think of the extra as an insurance policy.  My personal experience (albeit subjective and anecdotal) over the years has been that the extra protein did make a difference when bulking, especially when I was doing full body, heavy compound workouts 3x a week.

If you're hitting the recommended intake from normal foods, there's not a whole lot of room for processed carby junk food in the diet.  You can also lower the glycemic index of carbohydrate-rich foods by combining them with fats.  Supplementing fiber can be tricky as fermentable fibers lead to digestive issues in some individuals, and non-fermentable fibers can lead to mineral deficiencies (where processed junk foods aren't usually particularly nutrient-dense foods.)  There are tons of different kinds of fiber -- carrageenan is considered a dietary fiber, where you would really want to know what you're eating when you see ""fiber"" on the junk food label.

nutrition,38x6xy,sol_aries,7,Sun Jun 7 21:43:31 2015 UTC,"I also watched the film recently and I disagree with your interpretation of the main idea.   The overarching theme of the film is to reduce/eliminate processed foods from your diet. One of the main reasons the filmmakers give is that by eating those processed foods, you are consuming a lot of extra unnecessary calories because these companies add different types of sugars to enhance the flavor of their product. The benefits for these companies is twofold: first, they removed all of the fat from their foods to cater to the very common misconception that dietary fat=body fat, so adding sugar means the food still tastes good; second, the sugars they add light up the pleasure (addiction) centers in your brain which guarantees that you'll keep buying their products.  The unpleasant side effect of adding all of these sugars is that people are getting fat, but not one of these companies will take responsibility or even acknowledge that they play a part in the global obesity issue. It's very close to what happened with big tobacco in the past, and the general public is still at a point where they prefer to swallow the lies. There is a growing number of people who are aware of what's happening and they're trying to make a difference (the filmmakers, for example), but it's still an uphill battle right now.   A big part of the reason is that people still don't really understand what is good to eat and what isn't. It not anyone's fault, per se. We've been lied to by food manufacturers for decades and the science of nutrition is still very young. When it comes to educating others, things get really tricky because most people don't have any idea how complex metabolic processes are. They don't want to be bothered with the details of how their bodies absorb and metabolise fructose differently from sucrose. They want hard and fast answers, which is how we get to the impression that all sugar is bad, when that's not really true. A lot of people still argue about the merit of sugars and their sources (most of the threads in this sub devolve into this argument at some point or another.) although I think we all find common ground when it comes to refined sugar sources.   The one thing everyone who studies nutrition agrees on, regardless of whether they have formal education on the subject or have taught themselves as a hobby, is that processed food is shit and should be avoided completely. With all of this in mind, I'll answer your question in a way that will make sense to a layman.   Adding fiber to a diet of processed foods would be just like when cigarette companies started putting filters on their cigarettes. It would only lull you into a false sense of security, but do virtually nothing from a health perspective because that's just not how your body works. If you think about it, we're not that far from it already, since our processed foods alread come in super-sized or single serving sizes (100's or kings, anyone?), as well as regular and light versions. What you're proposing would essentially be like putting a couple of butterfly strips on a severed femoral artery."

The general average is that higher protein seems to be held in good opinion, but the levels of carbs seem to differ amongst who you talk to. I think this is where individual's needs comes in to play, some do better with moderate carbs and fats, some do better with low carbs.  Carbs can also be great for satiety as well.

nutrition,38x6xy,NigBeCray,-4,Mon Jun 8 00:00:45 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm sorry. Let me try again. its all based on chemicals and hormones. You gain weight because signals in your body tell you to gain weight. Leptin and Insulin are two of the big chemicals that tell you when youre hungry and when your satisfied and when to store and when not to store energy. high intake of fructose, (not carbs as a whole, not lipids, not rainbows) is the thing that disrupts these signals. You don't feel full,  you continue to eat high calories ( this is what youre saying), you dont expend energy you should (like a kid bouncing off the walls when a kid eats a cookie),. You brain thinks youre starving so you conserve, store energy in to fat reserves, and metabolic syndrome ensues.   Now lets look at the guy whos eating an excess of calories, say 3000 a day from meats and veggies. his brain says hes full. He gets a slow release of the energy in food that lasts all day. He doesnt store the energy. He expends it.  please correct me if im wrong.  Here is an except from this page that supports  www.gnolls.org/3586/carbohydrates-matter-at-least-at-the-low-end-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-calorie-to-your-body-part-vii/   A high-fat diet increased food intakeâbut the rats didnât get fat, even on over 35% more âcaloriesâ, unless sugar was added. Just 10% carbohydrate, from sugar, was enough to make a non-fattening zero-carb diet strongly fattening. Even at 10% carbohydrate from sugar, it still took 32% more âcaloriesâ to gain the same amount of weight that the rats gained on a 70% carbohydrate diet. It appears that much of the advantage of zero-carb diets is gone at just 10% carbohydrate."
nutrition,38x6xy,makearandomnoise,4,Mon Jun 8 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"lol I'm familiar with leptin and insulin.  The point is that over eating is the cause of weight gain, not any specific macro nutrient.  Carbs may contribute to over eating through satiety signals but don't they cause weight gain in and of themselves.  If you count calories properly the effect is completely negated.  You oversimplify the connection.  If someone who's unfamiliar with nutrition concepts read what you typed, they would walk away thinking they can eat whatever they want in enormous portions without gaining weight as long as there's no carbohydrates.  This is of course 100% wrong.  Also, just from a glance it's obvious that study you linked is flawed in many ways.  It's also a single study contradicting a large body of published research which states a calorie is a calorie no matter where it comes it from.

nutrition,38x6xy,Socrateswasacowboy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:09:33 2015 UTC,"Fruit contains fructose (fruit sugar). Your body needs to first digest the fiber to unlock the fructose. THEN, your body sends the fructose to the liver where it is converted into glucose (blood sugar) because your body cant use fructose. The whole process is pretty slow. When you consume sucrose (table sugar), it is disolved into one part glucose, one part fructose. The glucose goes straight to your blood where insulin gets busy. This process is much faster at spiking blood sugar. Fed Up doesnt talk much about starches, which are chains of glucose molecules which get released in your tummy very rapidly. Eating bread, pasta, and potatoes, and rice actually spikes your blood sugar faster than eating a snickers bar."

IGF-1 binding to the cognate receptor, IGF-1R, triggers a signaling cascade leading to proliferative and anti-apoptotic events.

nutrition,38yu8n,billsil,3,Mon Jun 8 03:36:40 2015 UTC,"Cherrypicking is when you're listing studies that support your agenda and leave out one that show evidence against it   Even from the same experiment...from Forks Over Knives.   The paper from India that Campbell found is called The Effect of Dietary Protein on Carcinogenesis of Aflatoxin, which appeared in the Archives of Pathology in 1968. Indeed, the researchers discovered that rats fed 5% of their diet as casein were generally free from cancerous growths, whereas the rats fed 20% casein were riddled with âem. But at the 16:37-minute mark, we get to see a snippet of this paper that shows us something equally important:  Donât get distracted by those red letters! What weâre interested in is the sentence near the bottom, which the filmâs producers apparently didnât notice: âIn all, 30 rats on the high-protein diet and 12 on the low-protein diet survived for more than a year.â   http://rawfoodsos.com/2011/09/22/forks-over-knives-is-the-science-legit-a-review-and-critique/  It gets even better.   Campbell tells us on page 59 of The China Study that plant proteins act fundamentally differently than animal proteins.  Gluten, the protein of wheat, did not promote cancer, while casein, the protein of milk, promoted it powerfully.  This study (7), however, showed that gluten was just as powerful as casein when lysine, its limiting amino acid, was provided.  Campbell never tells us this in The China Study. Nor does he tell us that casein is just as much an incomplete protein as gluten and that the reason it proved so effective in promoting cancer in his models was because he supplemented all of the diets with methionine.  Caseinâs limiting amino acids are methionine and cysteine, which can be converted into one another.  Thus methionine or cysteine make casein complete in the same way that lysine makes wheat protein complete.  In this paper, Campbell acknowledged that this was a general effect of protein, not something specific to specific proteins or to animal proteins:  [I]n 1945 Larsen and Heston found that the incidence of spontaneous pulmonary tumors was doubled in strain A mice fed low-casein diets supplemented with cystine (the most limiting amino acid).  Silverstone and Tannenbaum (14) showed that the development of spontaneous hepatomas was enhanced in C3H mice fed a gelatin-containing diet when methionine and cystine were added.  A review of the somewhat limited data from these and earlier studies (1) indicated that inhibition of tumor development as a result of marginal intakes of various proteins could be abolished by supplementation with the respective limiting amino acid for each protein. . . . [O]ur results suggest that the enhancement of focus development by lysine supplementation of gluten is due to a general improvement in dietary protein quality and not to any particular metabolic effect peculiar to lysine. This conclusion is supported by previous work (1, 12-14) showing that various low-quality proteins are better able to enhance tumor development when they are supplemented with the amino acid in greatest deficit.  Clearly the effect of protein in Campbellâs experiments had nothing to do with plant protein versus animal protein and was simply a general effect of complete protein, as he acknowledged in his own papers, at least during the 1980s.  In two papers published in 1997, by contrast, Campbell and colleauges cited the gluten-casein study as showing that plant proteins protect against cancer while animal proteins promote cancer (25, 26).  Thus by the time The China Study was published the fact that complete protein, and not animal protein specifically, promoted cancer in certain contexts was likewise lost down the memory hole.   http://www.westonaprice.org/blogs/cmasterjohn/the-curious-case-of-campbells-rats-does-protein-deficiency-prevent-cancer/"

Fat Sources As Seed Type Things: Almonds, Cashews, Flaxseed, Hempseed, or any other type of nut/seed (or adding almond butter or another alternative)  Fat Sources as Oils: Coconut oil, hempseed oil, flaxseed oil, olive oil"
nutrition,38uk9q,thejetter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all these great sources!  One of my main concerns is price so the non whole foods sources seem interesting however, I also would prefer to keep it mainly wholefoods.  Could you possibly point to some cheap wholefood protein sources that wouldn't mess with my other intakes too much?  Also, would just using oatmeal be a good sole source of carbs? And is it correct to not worry about the nutrient intake to much from this mixture if I am taking a MVI possibly twice a day?"
nutrition,38uk9q,thejetter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"Affordable whole food protein sources are eggs, meat, and yogurt. Your lactose intolerance means yogurt is out of the question.   Cartons of liquid egg whites are significantly more expensive because its more effort but is much easier to add to a shake. Meat and a shake? not to much. Depending on your area though prices will change.  Example: In southern California I buy eggs for $5/dozen (for organic). Standard eggs are more $2-3/dozen. Lets use $5 for 12 eggs. Each egg is 6 g protein. So there is roughly 70g protein for $5. Eggs: $1 for 14g Protein.  Protein Powders are roughly $20 for 20 servings. Each serving is about 20g protein. Protein Powder: $1 for 20g Protein  Meat is anywhere from $3 a pound and up. A pound of chicken breast will give you about 100g protein (24g per 4 ounces), at $3/pound. Chicken Breast: $1 for 30g protein  But it all comes down to what is easiest for you to eat/incorporate into your shakes.  You don't want only one source of carb or fat or protein, you want to use different sources because they have different nutrient profiles and vitamins in them. I'd say to use oats and fruits, plus you can play around with the taste a lot more with a variety of fruits.  I would still somewhat worry about nutrient intake because even if you hit all of your calories, carbs, fat, protein, your body still needs the vitamins and minerals. I'm assuming ""MVI"" is multivitamin? This goes back to Whole foods > non whole foods. So getting your nutrients from different fruits and veggies in your shakes would be ideal, when you can't get the nutrients from your shake, then incorporate the multi vitamin.  And I just remembered that avocado goes surprisingly well in shakes, and a great way to add fat."

Lean chicken + rice doesn't seem very balanced in the macronutrients, in the territory of a very low fat diet.  If you threw guacamole over the chicken, 1 avocado supplies 900+mg of K, which isn't too far off from taking another 10 pills.  Chicken + rice isn't too rich in micronutrients / phytonutrients.  If you switched the rice out with potato, you're adding on another 600+mg K.  Throw some zucchini on top, and that bumps it up by another 800+mg.  With a couple tomatoes, that's another 800+mg.

Avocados are a fruit and they shouldn't induce an afternoon crash.  There are tons of fruits that are low-GI and low in sugar, like summer squash, zucchini, bell peppers, cucumbers, eggplant, etc.  I can eat a huge plate of summer squash / tomato / cheese with a layer of olive oil or coconut oil and it's upwards of 16hrs worth of clean energy while in fruit-fueled nutritional ketosis.  Protein keeps you full if you're eating it with whole foods that provide protein, but if I throw down some whey isolate to try to satisfy hunger, the lack of calories and nutrients combined with raised insulin just makes me hungrier for a meal.  Imo, fat and large volumes of nutrient-dense food keep me full more than amino acids.  Carbs might make someone lethargic if they have some level of carbohydrate intolerance.

Oranges have low calorie density due to being very watery, so of course they have low nutrition by weight. But it's also easier to eat large volumes of oranges compared with more calorie dense foods.  A more relevant standard for comparing how foods satisfy micro nutrient needs is to compare by calories. Per 2500 Calories, oranges satisfy our requirements for   Thiamin by 300% Vitamin B6 by 200% Folate by 400% Calcium by 280% Potassium by 250%   Not so bad, now is it!

It's psychologically satisfying too, being able to discover which foods are valuable for yourself, not having to rely on second-hand proclamations, not having someone else do your thinking for you.  Regarding sorting all foods by this standard, you certainly won't find fruits near the top. The top spots are held by vegetables, followed by high quality animal foods such as seafood and venison. Not beef though, beef is roughly on par with oranges. And pork is trash.  While they aren't particularly amazing, saying that fruit have virtually no micronutrients except Vitamin C is strictly false. The worst that can be said about them is that they are fairly adequate. Except apples. Apples are sugar and water. Pears too.  Let me clarify as to the 500 grams of sugar; eating 2500 kCal of oranges isn't a dietary suggestion, it's just a conceptual tool. The notion is that you tally up the micronutrients in one day's worth of calories of a food. If most of the micros are above 100% RDA, then the food is helpful, as part of the diet, for reaching your micronutrient goals. If most of them are below 100%, it's unhelpful.  Judging by your latest response you already understood it, but I thought I should clarify."

Turns out it does that by irritating the gut wall so that it creates mucus to protect itself, and get that irritating thing out ASAP.  Vitamin C competes with Glucose for transport across the cell wall.  If you don't have a lot of Glucose, you don't need high levels of Ascorbic Acid.  This is why British sailors who live on hardtack (flour water salt) need to supplement with fresh citrus, and why Inuit get a very small amount of Vitamin C from meat they eat and don't get scurvy.

The potential for bioaccumulation seems worth investigating.  ""excretion of sucralose and/or its metabolites was prolonged in two of 8 unmedicated human subjects who consumed a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg 14C-sucralose which is less sucralose than in one 12-oz drink.

I was getting yeast infections, UTIs, kidney problems, anemia, thyroid disease, gastrointestinal problems to name just a few.. almost (but not) all of these disappeared within the first couple months of going gluten free. But the bloating and more minor symptoms started to disappear immediately, like i noticed a difference in my body within days. So that was pretty awesome lol. but im not going to lie to you, depending on the severity of your intolerance it can be pretty hard. mine is very bad so i can't eat out at all. but if bloating and reflux are the only gastro problems you have, you def would be able to still eat out, etc. in fact, it would actually be quite manageable. majority of places offer gluten free options these days. it sucks when there's pizza around or you go to a party and the only alcohol they offer is beer but you find ways to deal with this. overall, it just depends on the person. it can either be a minor diet adjustment (which is what yours sounds like) or a major lifestyle change (someone like me). as for the occasional gluten consumption, that is a 100% no for me. as for yourself, you'll have to test it out and see what happens. also, working it into your nutritional lifestyle is no problem. grains are absolutely not necessary to the human diet. if anything, they are detrimental. absolutely everything beneficial that you get from a grain you can find from another source that will offer you even more nutrients with less negative side effects. so good luck! you're best bet is going on an elimination diet aka just don't eat any gluten for 2 weeks to a month and see how you feel and go from there."

A big problem is that doing definitive studies has gotten immensely expensive so we have to rely on a lot of smaller, often less conclusive, studies.  There are also some who believe that if you suspect something is bad, you ought to announce it right away, even if it hasn't been shown conclusively to be the case, just in case.  When some of these suspitions are proven wrong, it hurts the credibility of the industry."

It's just the nature of the beast that how vitamins aid cell function is less cut-and-dry to learn in a classroom and a lab than a lot of areas of physics like heat or light or motion.

nutrition,38q90m,Fabaceae,2,Sat Jun 6 10:07:01 2015 UTC,"The easy answer is that nutrition is exceptionally challenging to study.  Nutrition is also a relatively young science compared to physics, chemistry, etc - people have been aware of nutritional concepts for a long time, but we only discovered vitamins ~100 years ago!  That said, there isn't actually as much disagreement as people like to suggest.  I read an awesome blog post about this recently but can't seem to find it. :(  We have a pretty good idea of what basic healthy eating patterns look like - it just doesn't make good headlines.  Keep in mind that not every ""expert"" found online or in the news is actually an expert.    There is also a huge movement from every angle to discredit the science of ""the other guys.""  You can see it in this very thread: one side has a distaste for the medical establishment and government recommendations, while dietitians and other experts are quick to dismiss ""fad"" diets.  A lot of diets actually have very good principles at their core - eat lots of vegetables, limit processed foods - but many take it a step or two further (and sometimes at the expense of emotional or social well-being).  We agree on some science, but opinions start to split on concepts that are not well studied or are difficult to study (conflicting evidence, easy to cherry-pick)."
nutrition,38q90m,billsil,4,Sat Jun 6 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"Because nutrition isn't a science.  It's based on fear.  What was the evidence to support the idea that dietary cholesterol was harmful?  The guy who came up with the hypothesis came up with the idea in 1952.  He retracted his position in 1958 stating it had minimal impact on blood cholesterol.  Despite that, in 1978, limiting dietary cholesterol became part of the recommendations.  It was finally removed this year.  Fat was bad in the 1980s and relaxed a bit in the 1990s.  It's more or less gone now, with the blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes being more targeted towards refined carbohydrates with an extra focus on refined sugar.  What changed?  The science didn't change.  Just this year, a review of that recommendation given the data that was available when it was made was done.  It didn't support the conclusion to go on a low fat diet.  Why is it only now (in the last 2 years) that there are recommendations to added limit sugar consumption to 25 grams per day?  That's 1/2 a soda and considering there is added sugar in bread, lunch meat, yogurt, in pasta sauce, in almost everything, if you don't actively avoid it, you're probably getting too much.  The problem lies in 1) authors can reach any conclusion they want to.  If you expect saturated fat to be unhealthy and you show the opposite, if you cut the data differently, you can show the ""correct"" result.  You have to cut it to try and account for confounding variables, but cutting it in an unbiased way is hard.  2) Correlation is not causation.  For example, red meat could be bad because hamburgers (think McDonalds) is red meat, but it's also french fries, refined carbohydrates, coke, a generally poor quality diet, low income, no vegetables, etc.  So is it the meat or the vegetaranism or the fish or the wine or the cheese or is it the thing x is strongly associated with something else.  We know burned anything (meat, starch, fat) is carcinogenic (think McDonalds, BBQ, french fries, KFC), but what happens if you eat veggies with the meat?  You cut the high temperature carcinogens by ~90%.  You could always cook at a lower temperature too.  3) People lie unintentionally.  A few years back, there was a review of all the weight loss studies that have been done.  If they believed the data, everyone should have lost weight, but often there is little long term weight loss on any diet.  If you're not driving your self nuts weighing all your food, your caloric estimates are off.  If there's a food survey done on 100,000 people and 16 years later the researchers check who gets what diseases (this actually happened), how accurate is the study?"

The amount of protein you're inhibited from absorbing is small but an exact amount would be hard to pin down (10% tops is my guesstimate). Beans are also dense in fiber which is good but some of the nutrients in beans are bound to the fiber and you don't end up absorbing it.  The other two antinutrients are scarier: phytic acid and lectins.  Lectins are particularly nasty.  If you prepare beans correctly, you avoid the negative effects of these but you also destroy some of the nutrients and denature the protein.  Also, I don't know anyone who prepares beans correctly.  It's a lengthy process and I don't have time for that: soak for two days in a semi-acidic solution while keeping it constantly warm and changing the water 5-6 times.

That is by no means supportive of veg*an diets.  There are populations that eat very high amounts of meat, with similarly low rates of disease. That suggests something else is at play, no? What do americans eat that these populations don't? Carbohydrates with meat, and cooking oil of course!  And no, alcohol is not permissible if you value your cognitive health. It causes demyelination, loss of DHA-bound phosphatidylserine, and potential rebound glutamate excitotoxicity. Its effects on cognition are pretty clear."

That said, checking multiple sources is always good for getting the best approximation.  You're right to say that the range here is absurd. Even a quick check shows that the top and bottom entries here are obviously just bad data.

Healthy fats like coconut oil and avocado are also good, but they tend to be more expensive, at least where I'm from (canada).  Rice is another staple that you can pair pretty much anything with and you can buy a large amount to last for a long period of time.  Dairy is usually higher in calories and also has protein and things like calcium and certain vitamins.  You can add heavier creams to sauces to add some extra calories, or add more oils like olive oil, or even butter.    What kind of cooking and baking appliances do you have access to?

Garbanzo beans/chick peas are versatile.  Really it's personal taste.  If you can, in the future, get yourself a small slowcooker.  It's particularly good for students because you can throw all the ingredients in and let it cook while you are in classes and such.  Chilis and stews are excellent meals to throw together and they freeze well.    At this point it's about buying cheap staples in bulk, if possible, and the adding your calories with sauces and such.  When I was a college student, this worked the best for my nutritional needs and my budget.  You'll want to get as many calories from healthy fats and protein as possible.  Carbs are decent but too many can become unhealthy very quickly, especially refined carbs."
nutrition,38qfe0,tpm_,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:08:16 2015 UTC,"I'm also trying to gain weight, and have successfully gained like 15 lbs so far. Here are some things that are calorie dense that are easy to add to your diet.  Nuts of any kind, like almonds or cashews. They're about 500 calories per cup. A bag of nuts can be expensive but they contain enough calories that I think it offsets it. Buying in bulk helps.  Peanut butter, too. Make sure you don't get sick of it--you can cook it into Thai pasta or eat it on sandwiches...maybe look up more recipes.  Granola is really high in calories. A cup of that with some milk to turn it into cereal can really push 6-700 calories  Some people do this thing called ""GOMAD"" or ""Gallon of Milk a Day"" where they sip a gallon of milk over a day, every day, until they gain a few lbs. I'm sure it's a relatively cheap solution, but if you're lactose intolerant like me it's not going to work. So instead...  Try making weight gain shakes. There are tons of variations of these but basically you use milk (or I use soy milk) with protein powder, bananas, chocolate powder, strawberries, oats, etc. and blend it up and drink it. The ones I make fit into a coffee cup and are 450-500 calories. Other guys make much bigger ones.  An old trick a nutritionist taught me is to make sure you add a drink to every meal. If you eat the same amount as before and add a beverage to every meal, you can easily add 500 calories every day. I mix it up and do juice one meal, soymilk one meal, and sometimes I make a cocktail at night, so I'm not constantly drinking sugary stuff.  Bananas. They go down easy, they're super cheap and they're relatively caloric for fruits. 1-200 calories for something small and portable. Same for avocados, although those aren't always so cheap. Avocados also have tons of fiber if you need that.  Remember that the more you cook and less you eat out, the more money you're going to have for food in the long run, If you're eating out, make smart choices--get something that you know is more calorie dense. It doesn't have to be junk food, but for example if you're at an Italian place, one type of pasta can easily have much more calories than another kind.   Finish your god damn meals and don't throw away any food. The most important thing for me to start doing as a skinny person was just finishing my food every meal, and then I became used to eating more. Also, any time anyone I know is about to throw away perfectly good food, I take it home. You're also doing the world a favor by encouraging a less wasteful culture.  I've been finding that, if I cook something with rice for example, it's relatively easy to just make more rice. It goes down easily and a bag of dried rice is super cheap. Google is telling me there is about 700 calories in a cup of dried rice. I'll make some kind of meat and veggies with the rice, which is, say, 300 calories. I eat that first and have some rice left over at the bottom of my bowl, and that's pretty easy to just gobble down.   I know the struggle and believe me you can do it. I failed many times at gaining weight until I really figured out what I was doing, and now I weigh more than I ever have in my life, and I'm keeping on going with it."

You will be eating a diet from today until the day you die, we need food to live.  Our bodies are made of what we eat, we burn what we eat to move.  Our diet is the biggest contributing factor to our long-term health and well-being. fruits and vegetables are generally healthy to very healthy things to consume, there's nothing wrong with eating bananas, carrots, and apples.  Make sure you are also getting healthy protein and fats along with healthy carbs: fish, eggs, chicken breast, turkey breast... olive oil, avocado, etc.  Also make sure to eat lots of leafy greens (spinach, lettuce, kale, bok choi, etc etc), the fiber helps fill you up and there is no other type of food as packed with vitamins and minerals as leafy greens. Burning more calories than you take in, as /u/SheFightsHerShadow noted, is the key to weight loss.  Exercise can help this, but weight is lost and kept off in the kitchen, not the gym.

Exercise at lower intensities, like aerobic hiking, will burn more fat than carbohydrates. Proteins actually factor very little into energy, so the cravings you feel after hiking are probably the desire to replace lost fat stores in the muscles that have been working hardest.  As you exercise harder and your heart pumps faster, like in running or cycling, your body will use carbohydrates as its primary energy source. Surprisingly, this is not how hiking or mountaineering is fueled.   If you're interested in the physiology, I would really recommend checking out a book called Training for the New Alpinism. It's geared towards mountaineering, but does a tremendous job of explaining the physical and nutritional needs of someone moving with their legs in the mountains. For me, it was an eye-opening read: http://www.patagonia.com/us/product/training-for-the-new-alpinism?p=BK695-0  Since you're vegetarian but down with dairy, it would make sense to incorporate more fatty foods into your regular diet. Cheese, avocados, etc. You'll gain a little weight, but your overall performance and energy reserves for hiking will rise substantially."

nutrition,38irg1,Woogies,23,Thu Jun 4 14:17:42 2015 UTC,"This is a super simplified version but... It could also be because a lot of the crap food is high in sugar/simple carbs. When you eat this, it sends a lot of glucose in to your bloodstream, causing an insulin spike. The insulin's job (amongst other things) is to clear the glucose from your blood stream and help you store the energy if it's not needed. When this happens, this is what's commonly referred to as a sugar crash and you'll feel low in energy. Your body wants more energy so it will tell you to take a nap or to be hungry so you eat more.   TL;Dr: Eat sugar ->ENERGY ->Insulin to clear sugar ->Sugar Crash -> HUNGRY/Sleepy ->Eat sugar     and the cycle goes on and on, and that's how the website PeopleofWalmart was born."

Not only did I have less appetite, but my EXPERIENCE of hunger was different.  Sugar crash, for me at least, was a hunger that I felt through out my entire body.  But real hunger is more centralized in the actual stomach, and isn't so DESPERATE and overwhelming.  Once I had detoxed from sugar enough to realize that, it became so much easier to recognize when I'd made bad food choices recently.  I feel the sugar crash come back, and know I've been getting a little lax."

nutrition,38irg1,Bearblasphemy,2,Fri Jun 5 05:03:58 2015 UTC,"The point is, enterocytes rapidly absorb the large bolus of glucose produced by a starchy food. They will also do this with common table sugar or high fructose corn syrup, HOWEVER, 1/2 of the content of these simple carbohydrates are fructose, which will not contribute to blood glucose and will similarly not cause much of an insulin response. Hence why the American Diabetes Association used to allow surprisingly high amounts of sugary foods in diabetic diets....they were wrong, of course, but the that was the logic anyway."

And I had varying diets with no salads, only salads. High-fat keto for months, and afterwards daily self-made pizza with normal wheat. Also I eat fruit daily sometimes, nor none at all for weeks.  I do get a lot of sun as we have 300+ days of sun a year. I donÂ´t overdo it tho.   So yea I would think maybe variety is a huge factor to improve your immune system. I also skip processed foods mostly and I am a male single so my kitchen is not superclean. One thing IÂ´ve been doing for a while tho is to grow sprouts from different seeds/beans, and use GOOD olive oil (that scratches in your throat from the anti-oxidants). But theres probably like 10 foods I do eat kinda regularly that might all play its part. Like dark chocolate, grapefruit, garlic, oregano, kuruma, wild-caugh salmon.. and also ~ 1-2 litres of beer or 0,7l (one bottle) of wine daily or almost daily sometimes for weeks!! But I can also go without alcohol for months like now. Also I drink coffee daily, tho itÂ´s just instant coffee.   Pretty sure itÂ´s all in the mix...

I also second what the person above said - zinc, iron, vitamin C & D, selenium and magnesium are important. Also, I was once deficient in B12 and I noticed leading up to that I was getting a lot of post viral infections so thats another important one too which can be difficult to get in your diet if you don't eat a lot of meat.  Without taking supplements I would suggest a Mediterranean diet. Wholegrains, legumes, olive oil, veges, fruit, low fat dairy products, seafood, and small amounts of meat.  Stress can also be a BIG factor in getting recurring infections. The people I know who get sick often are the ones that are very busy and very stressed so make sure you look after yourself, rest, and get adequate sleep."

Breakfast would be eggs Ã  la microwave, then add cheeses, veggies, and spices however I felt that day.  Lunch would be a lettuce wrap with whatever meats I had. Dinner would be whatever, usually a protein with veggies smothered in butter and spices.  I'm not much of a cook but it kept me going and was tasty.  But I was limiting carbs to 5% of my total daily calories.  With 30%, you should have more room to work with.  If you take carbs out where it's easy (like lettuce wraps), you can use carbs in other meals.  Edit: Also, in case you didn't see my other comment, I'm not an expert.

You are at a much greater risk of heart disease when you have too many boats in the river. Not too much cargo. You are also at a higher risk of heart disease when those boats are damaged, or oxidized, and when your blood vessels themselves are damaged. Too many boats in the river, and oxidative damage to those boats are both caused by blood sugar disregulation, chronically high insulin and blood sugar, too much omega 6 fats leading to inflammation, and not enough antioxidants to repair damage."

Let's assume we have a daily calorie goal of 2000 calories a day (because that's about as average as we are going to get). Of those 2000 calories, let's assume we have a macro split of 50% carbs, 20% protein, and 30% fat (since that seems to be pretty textbook for health professionals these days).   So, that means about 67g of fat/day. 12 eggs brings you to about 58 grams of fat/day, leaving you with 9 grams of fat left for the entire day. Doable? Yes. Convenient or wise? Probably not."

Even under strict AHA low-SFA guidelines of 7%, you still have room for another 12.2g of SFA in a 2,000kcal day.  Most of the cholesterol in your body is synthesized, and most of the cholesterol that is absorbed in the gut is reabsorbed cholesterol that was synthesized.  With regular exercise and healthy cholesterol (assuming you're not a hyper-absorber of cholesterol), you should be fine.  While the eggs are a decent source of protein, they're an even better source of choline, imo."

HDL and LDL are proteins that transport cholesterol, and there aren't two types, there are 5.  Some are big, like HDL, and can carry a lot more cholesterol than a small one like vLDL.

nutrition,38ft2m,kteague,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"Cholesterol is not a protein.  LDL is a protein that transports cholesterol around.  Glucose can dissolve into the blood and get where it needs to go, but fat/cholesterol/proteins cannot.  They need to be carried around.  Cholesterol has a very, very important role in the body and the body (it's used inside every cell wall) is very good at managing it.  Almost every cell in the body can produce it with very few exceptions.  About 80% of the cholesterol you have is made by the liver.  LDL is comprised of two main subclasses, LDL-A (driven by dietary fat) and LDL-B (driven by dietary carbohydrates; refined ones especially).  LDL carries cholesterol from the liver to cells, while HDL carries cholesterol from cells back to the liver.  The smaller the LDL (so primarily LDL-B), the less cholesterol you can carry, so you need more total particles, which increases your risk for problems assuming the same total LDL measurement (since we don't typically measure LDL-A vs. LDL-B).  A good LDL measurement can give you a false sense of security if it's primarily LDL-B, whereas LDL-A will come back looking higher because the total amount of cholesterol is measured, not the number of particles.  The more of the metabolic syndrome risk factors you have (high fasting blood glucose, high triglycerides, central trunk obesity, high blood pressure, low HDL), the more likely you are to have high LDL-B.

They are assemblies of proteins and lipids (like cholesterol, triglyceride, cholesteryl esters, etc.). There are five types of lipoproteins: low-density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoproteins, intermediate-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, and chylomicrons. When referring to the cholesterol carried by lipoproteins, these are referred to as LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), etc. Cholesterol can exist in the body in a lipoprotein that is transporting it, alone as a lipid in cell membranes, or as a precursor to steroid hormones/bile acids/vitamin D. If you look at the structure of cholesterol, there are no amino acids. In order for something to be considered a protein, it must be made up of at least one amino acid residue. Cholesterol is made up of 4 rings (the sterol portion) and a hydrocarbon tail. So basically, lipoproteins do contain cholesterol but the actual cholesterol molecule is a lipid."

It's not their fault they don't understand but still, don't let them get in the way of your happiness.  I am speaking from personal experience.  Work out to feel good, not look good, and you and everyone else will notice how much better you look.  In regards to professional help, it took me at least 4-5 doctors until I finally found one I like.  Granted the first 4-5 were dudes I didn't really listen to, and the one I have now is a hot woman, whatever works is what I say.  My depression and anxiety has been taken care of (and still being taken care of on a day-to-day basis, it is a war that never ends but one in which a prolonged cease fire can be achieved through diligent work) and it wasn't until I accepted that I couldn't do it on my own that I started to make progress.  In regards to your height and weight, you need to start eating hard.  I am 6'1ish maybe 6'2 and 204ish and I just don't understand how you are standing.  If you are exercising regularly, I'd say anywhere under 3000-3500 calories a day is too little.  Concentrate on getting at least 150 grams of protein a day, but more importantly, make sure you are getting good fats and good carbs.  Good fats in my opinion:  Walnuts, Almonds, Avacado, Coconut Oil, Egg Yolk (good source of vitamin D I believe which can help with depression),   Good carbs:  Oats, Fruits, Veggies,  I dk... other shit too that's just what I eat and my gains have been crazy...  You're at the weight where throwing a pound of pasta and some ground turkey together on a day-to-day basis could be beneficial.    But other than getting professional help to deal with your mental health, which should be your primary concern, learning nutrition and biology from ""trusted"" sources should be your next because listening to your body and being armed with the power of knowledge to treat it should be your next concern.

I took a year off school, because I hated it sooo much, and that really helped out. If I ever feel like I need help I will definitely go to a professional. My family's wasn't the only one with an unhelpful attitude, even the psychiatrists talked like I was a weirdo for being depressed and that made me feel even worse. I know it's now true, but just the fact that they said that made me completely doubt them.  I'm not sure what type of exercises I should be doing. Do you know of any simple exercise routine for someone like me? I did a lot of searching, and I came across extremely different routines. Some suggested working out daily and then there were ones that recommended doing it 3-4 times a week. I like workouts with pushups, crunches, lunges etc. but me and weights don't go well together.  As for my diet, the difficult part is making a custom one. My mum has to cook for several other people as well, and it just becomes a pain making custom meals for everyone. I'll try to go to a dietitian, but I'm currently in the middle of moving, and that is going to make it difficult."

The first 4-5 I thought were either fucks or they made me feel like a fuck.  Lucky number 6 has done me wonders.  In regards to which exercises you should do, I just suggest going to the gym and finding something you like.  Try everything  and you will notice the ones you enjoy and those will be the ones you gravitate to because exercising is all about feeling good, meditating, and having fun.  Looking good is just an extra reward.  Once you are at the gym you will see some buff dudes doing certain things and you will want to try them and you might find those are the things you like to enjoy.  I do pretty much everything.  I do things that some people would consider bodybuilding, squats, deadlifts, bench, lat pulldowns, rows, shoulder press, some of the machines, and I also do cross-fit shit like tire flipping, sledge hammer swings, rock-climbing, push-ups, and what not.  I also do a good amount of cardio too, elliptical, stairmaster, and bike for the most part.  I try and make whatever cardio I do, weight resistant cardio.  I also stretch, sleep well, drink a fuckton of water and made sure my breathing was good which is a huge part of the battle.  But that is just my cup of tea.

I liked both, but I feel like it only works if you use the medication like you would a cast on a broken leg, it's temporary and let's you do the real healing in therapy, but to each his own. The weight is really likely just a symptom of the depression, some people eat more when depressed and some people eat less. Depression can steal joy from all parts of life, we're supposed to get joy from food so we keep eating it but without that joy eating can seem like kind of a weird and gross thing to do.  Second, all weight is not equal. Even if you are underweight you can still have a high percentage of body fat, even if you seem like skin and bones, which can be unhealthy. You are underweight but you want to gain the right kind of weight. You want to gain mostly muscle and only a little bit of fat to stay healthy. Gaining mostly muscle now will also help keep your metabolism high as you age so you can better avoid gaining fat when you are older. If you don't have access to a gym you could start doing bodyweight exercises like pushups and pullups and one legged squats, these will take you a long way and can be done anywhere and anytime. Then, to feed your new muscle you can get a protein powder and drink one or two shakes a day on top of whatever else you happen to eat, they come in many flavours and I prefer the whey isolate but you can choose whatever kind meets your needs as they will all work (for instance, simple whey is cheaper than isolate, if you are lactose intolerant they have egg, if you are vegan they have pea, etc...). If you really want to focus on the weight gain you can add higher calorie items to the protein shakes, like a spoon of peanut butter or some avocado, and you can mix it with whole milk.  Most people find drinking calories to be the easiest when they have trouble getting enough food in.   The most important part, however, is treating the depression, if you can't get that under control the weight will probably always be an uphill battle. Deep down I feel like you know this, but I hope hearing it from internet strangers makes it sink in. You deserve better than what depression will leave you with."

nutrition,38eech,Delysid52,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:11:33 2015 UTC,"People like hearing good things about their bad habits   I could say the same thing about eating as much sugar as you want.  We should be eating real foods and meat is a real food.  It also comes with saturated fat.  We should also be eating fruits and non-starchy veggies.  It's shocking really that people are surprised that we should be eating real food.  Every creature evolved eating real food and it's only in the last century that it's even been possible for to eat highly processed junk food.  Shockingly, we get sick when we do.   Saturated fat prevents coronary artery disease? An American paradox  What are the effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in comparison with those of a higher-fat, lower-carbohydrate diet? The response differs by the 2 main types of hyperlipidemia: simple hypercholesterolemia and combined hyperlipidemia. In our studies of simple hypercholesterolemia in men, a fat intake <25% of energy and a carbohydrate intake >60% of energy was associated with a sustained increase in triacylglycerol of 40%, a decrease in HDL cholesterol of 3.5%, and no further decrease in LDL in comparison with higher fat intakes (5). In contrast, a low-fat diet in persons with combined hyperlipidemia caused no worsening of triacylglycerol or HDL, but intakes of fat >40% of energy and of carbohydrate <45% of energy for 2 y were associated with a lower triacylglycerol concentration at a stable weight (6). In the subjects of Mozaffarian et al, a greater saturated fat intake paralleled a total fat intake, which ranged from 18% to 32% of energy in the first to fourth quartiles. Modest favorable trends in triacylglycerol and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were observed with higher fat intakes.  These effects include the paradox that a high-fat, highâsaturated fat diet is associated with diminished coronary artery disease progression in women with the metabolic syndrome, a condition that is epidemic in the United States.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/5/1102.full  There's also a French paradox and an Inuit paradox if you're counting; well unless it's really not a paradox and saturated fat is possibly neutral and just associated with bad habits   Several new, sometimes controversial, concepts have arisen that challenge underlying assumptions of the Keys-Hegsted regression equations. First, although saturated fats as a class raise LDL, they also appear to have primary responsibility among dietary fatty acids for raising HDL, possibly depending on a balanced intake of polyunsaturated fats. Second, not all saturated fatty acids are equally responsible for changes in LDL or HDL. Only natural triglycerides (TG) rich in lauric (12:0) and myristic (14:0) acids are especially cholesterolemic, whereas 16:0-rich fats can be neutral or cholesterol-raising depending on the metabolic circumstances (lipoprotein setpoint) of the host. In normolipemic individuals with normal lipoprotein metabolism, dietary palmitic acid (16:0) typically appears neutral. When lipoprotein metabolism is impaired, eg, if LDL receptor activity is depressed by the presence of dietary cholesterol, consumption of 16:0-rich TGs can contribute to hypercholesterolemia. Although stearic acid (18:0) is typically considered neutral, exaggerated consumption of 18:0-rich fat (cocoa butter) lowers both LDL and HDL. Third, the saturated fat effect is related both to the dietary cholesterol load and the lipoprotein setpoint of the host, eg, 16:0 becomes progressively cholesterolemic as dietary cholesterol raises the setpoint.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7585292  There's a lot more grey than you can even imagine.  Like saturated fat raises HDL, which lowers your risk of heart disease and diabetes or fat in general lowers triglycerides, which again lowers your risk for heart disease and diabetes."

Apologies, but some quick googling (and reading science and nutrition based sites) would show why it is wrong. </edit>  Why would anyone try and debunk something that has no supporting evidence at all?  To start with though - enzymes are targeted at the macronutrient. There is no difference between the enzymes used to break down starch or simple sugars. Therefore eating fruit with another meal especially after the meal would mean that the fructose is broken down quicker due to the more complex starches already breaking down before the fructose reaches the enzymes. There is not enough time, regardless of digestion for the food to ferment in the gut. The longest time a complex carb spends in the stomach is 3 hours and the gut does not..blah blah blah I could carry on but all I have written is just as unsupported as your original statement."

Overall, consumers can safely eat at least 12oz of a variety of cooked seafood per week, provided they pay attention to local seafood advisories and limit their intake of large, predatory fish. Women who may become or who are pregnant, nursing mothers, and children ages 12 and younger can safely consume a variety of cooked seafood in amounts recommended by this Committee, while following Federal and local advisories.   The EPA set the Oral Reference Dose of mercury at 0.1 mcg/kg daily for adults.   For example, 150 lbs person would have a daily maximum of 6.8 mcg of mercury. Whereas, the standard serving of light tuna is ~13 mcg (mercury) per 4 oz serving (of tuna). This notably exceeds the daily requirement thus why we do not recommend daily intake of tuna. But to more accurately quantify we move from a daily to weekly timescale.  Following our example, a 150 lb person would have a maximum intake of 47 mcg/week of mercury (6.8 mcg/day x 7). This equates to roughly 3 standard servings of tuna (39 mcg/week). This falls within the recommendation from USDA and FDA (above).    There is a phenomenal table in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans - Appendix 11 that details the amount of mercury in different servings of fish.   Official link (PDF page 98; Document Page 85)  Direct link - Crappy Scan from a Doula's website   Basically take your weight in lbs and divide by 2.2 for your weight in kilograms. Take this number and times it by 0.1, this will be your daily limit of mcg. Now times that by 7 for your weekly recommended maximum intake. Then cross reference with the charts from Dietary Guidelines for Americans.   Finally, there is a great Draft from the FDA here (similar to the first link posted) that answers any further questions."

If you don't care about monotony then cold cereal with (soy)milk and/or greek yogurt and some fruit in the mornings. Find a low sugar high fiber cereal. Or make oatmeal using old-fashioned oats, not instant. If you want to boost the protein content add some PB2 or soy grits. You can have this every morning.  For lunch you can have a turkey sandwich on low calorie bread with mustard and a big salad on the side. Throw lots of veggies in your salad, like tomato, carrot, cucumber, sliced beets, bell peppers, artichoke hearts, cucumbers, shredded cabbage, etc... Or skip the sandwich and put the turkey on the salad, or tuna fish or canned salmon. Or some rinsed canned beans and low fat cheese. Use reduced calorie salad dressing, balsamic vinegar or even lemon juice. Sprinkle dried herbs on there for extra flavor. You can make your salads in advance and store them individually in mason jars or tupperware. Or you can chop all your veggies in advance and then have your own salad bar in your fridge.  Basic dinner is chicken or fish and plenty of veggies and you can have more salad too. Saute or broil the chicken or fish using cooking spray. You can use frozen veggies. There are frozen veggies you can steam in the bag but watch out, some are very caloric due to the addition of sauces.  If you want some carbs on the side opt for whole grains like brown rice or quinoa. Starchy veggies can be consider a grain, so corn, winter squash, potatoes.  Get a food scale and weigh everything and then log it in myfitnesspal.com.  Too tired to cook? A frozen entree plus a salad and some fruit for dessert if you have room for the calories."

The title is confusing and potentially harmful to many readers.

nutrition,382vbi,evange,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, and after looking through ~390 pdf files I am still unsure if I have the correct source: ""Nutrition for the Japanese elderly"" by H. Shibata, H. Nagai, H. Haga, S. Yasumura, T. Suzuki, Y Suyama. [1]   The food intake pattern in Okinawa has been different from that in other regions of Japan. The people there have never been influenced by Buddhism. Hence, there has been no taboo regarding eating habits. Eating meat was not stigmatised, and consumption of pork and goat was historically high. It was exceptional among Japanese food consumption.  Since the end of the Second World War, the difference between Okinawa and the other regions has diminished. However, the Nutrition Survey in 1988 conducted by the Okinawa prefectural government showed that there were still slight differences between Okinawa and other regions. The intake of meat was higher in Okinawa: 86.5g in Okinawa, 74.1g in average Japanese. On the other hand, the intake of fish was lower in Okinawa: 79.4g in Okinawa, 96.1g in average Japanese. Intake of NaCl was lower: 10.4g in Okinawa 12.2g in average Japanese. Deep colored vegetables were taken more in Okinawa: 106.9g in Okinawa, 72.8g in average Japanese.  These characteristics of dietary status are thought to be among the crucial factors which convey longevity and good health to the elderly in Okinawa Prefecture.   This directly contradicts ""History and characteristics of Okinawan longevity food"" by Hiroko Sho, which has more extensive citations and actually detail diets over the eras. However it scarcely mentions fish, and when it does it makes the following claim:   The foods consumed at these festivals vary from district to district, but they usually include animal proteins not normally available, such as pork, fish and fish paste.   Which I find very strange. Fish is not normally available on an island, in a country that is historically fishy? What?"

He thinks fish oil is better than eating fish, because right now there are no ""safe"" fish, and when the oil is removed, it can be molecularly distilled to remove any mercury or PCBs. If you do eat fish--choose wild salmon.   Nevermind, he moved to supplements (algae derived no doubt despite this text) and jumped on the fish is bad bandwagon."

nutrition,382vbi,billsil,3,Mon Jun 1 19:43:30 2015 UTC,"Doubtful.  Fish oil studies have shown great benefit due to the DHA content.  I'm not convinced omega 3s are really as important as the studies say (vs. omega 3 consumption being a sign of an overall good diet).  The omega 3s prevent heart disease idea came from the Inuit who eat tons of saturated fat and omega 3s and don't get heart disease.  I'm more partial to the saturated fat idea is neutral idea.  We just can't wrap our heads around the concept of being wrong.  There's a French, Inuit, and American paradox in regards to saturated fat.  Maybe it's not really a paradox.  Most saturated fats (not stearic acid which is the main saturated fat in beef) does raise LDL, but higher LDL doesn't equal heart disease."
nutrition,382vbi,FrigoCoder,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"All of these paradoxes suddenly start to make sense if you disregard the idea that saturated fat has anything to do with heart disease, and accept that confounding variables are responsible, such as carbohydrates often consumed with meat, and low quality cooking oils used to cook them, among other bad habits.  The Inuit eat a diet very low in carbohydrates and use seal oil for cooking. The French never adopted the low fat message, and continue eating full fat cheese, milk, and meat. Meanwhile what do americans eat? Unsatiating low fat products pumped full of sugar to give them flavor, french fries cooked in sunflower and other unhealthy vegetable oils, hamburger buns, sugary drinks, corn, soybeans, pancakes drenched in high fructose corn syrup, the list goes on.  Drawing the conclusion that the better health outcomes are due to the presence of some magical substance, such as omega 3, resveratrol, or oleic acid, is akin to not seeing the forest for the trees. No paradoxes here, just trees.  Speaking of that, we shouldn't look solely at heart disease. Cognition is important too. EPA and DHA might or might not be useful against heart disease, but they are certainly essential for cognition and are frequenty supplemented to that end. Oleic acid might be useful against depression. Saturated fat, cholesterol, and hormones are especially important for cognitive function.  Yeah, it is very very difficult to avoid culturally ingrained myths such as the fear of fat and salt. I regularly have to consume additional salt on keto, and I still find it strange and borderline wrong.  LDL is not specific to heart disease. Weight loss and exercise also affect it, along with numerous other things I imagine. Low LDL levels are actually correlated with higher in-hospital mortality, as well as shorter lifespans in multiple sclerosis patients."

Your average person is much more receptive to the ""healthy diet"" message than to ""(almost) vegan diet"" or ""stepping stone to veganism"" or ""diet from that vegan researcher"". He essentially removes loaded semantics that makes people more suspectible to his message. Besides, even weak association of veganism with PETA is particularly unhelpful, and he completely avoids that.  I give vegan researchers and high-level activists credit, they are some crafty motherfuckers. It is inadvisable to take them for fools. They use every tool at their disposal to further their agenda: Industrial support, political manipulation, ridicule of opponents and destruction of their careers, exploitation of common myths, logical fallacies, cherry picking studies, even valid studies comparing vegan diets against clown diets, et cetera."

I don't know about the other docs, but I'm sure most of them still wear leather, wool, and silk, eat honey, feed their pets meat based foods, use toiletries with lanolin, and use other non-vegan products.   Meat is not good for you. I know it's hard to change your lifestyle, but you can't just dismiss scientific fact because you don't like the ethical slant of some people.  Ethics is just one reason why people go vegan. You can identify as a vegan and still eat in a way that the PCRM would disagree with (oreos and most potato chips are technically vegan), likewise you can eat primarily vegetables with a small portion of meat used only as a garnish/for flavour less than once a week and the PCRM would probably find that okay.

Nah. At least Ornish and Campbell know full well their diets are subpar, others are suspect as well:   Ornish explicitly spoke out against the scientific method because that would show his diet is inferior to low carb. Campbell behaves differently whether he is being peer reviewed, and actually contradicts his own book. A long-term study of Esselstyn has a disrepancy in the number of participants, hinting at forgery. McDougall has a $5k resort so he has a vested interest in keeping up the facade. Barnard released a meta-analysis with specifically tailored criteria that resulted in the inclusion of studies only from him and his colleagues.   These people are not stupid. There is no way they missed all the arguments and evidence against carbohydrates and in favor of low carb diets, as well the enormous problems with anti-meat studies and their own studies. No, they have an agenda to drive.   It has nothing to do with ethics.   Of course. Vegan researchers have no ethics.   McDougall eats turkey once every other year on thanksgiving to prove that.   Allegedly. Fits nicely into my pet theory that they don't want to be labeled as veg*ans due to the negative connotations. Forks over knives also used the same flowery ""plant-based diet"" phrase. But whatever, it makes little difference.   Meat is not good for you. I know it's hard to change your lifestyle, but you can't just dismiss scientific fact because you don't like the ethical slant of some people.   Meat cooked in low quality vegetable oil and consumed with refined carbohydrates is the one that is not good for you.  ""Scientific facts"" are not derived from observational studies that fail to control for two such enormous confounding factors, among others.

If you eat high fat or high carb but stay lean, you probably won't get terrible health problems.  Can someone explain this?

nutrition,382vbi,billsil,8,Mon Jun 1 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, at it's core obesity is caused by calories in:calories out. But you can hedge your bets by eating primarily foods high in fiber, high in water, high in nutrients, and low in calories. I.e. whole plant-based foods.   The volume of food people like to eat doesn't change that much based on the composition of the food, and satiety is closely tied to the physical feeling of fullness. If you eat the right things obesity just becomes a lot more difficult attain.   Weight is also not the be-all and end-all of health. You can be thin and unhealthy and you can be moderately fat and healthy. Weight is as much a function of how much you eat as it is what you eat. People with bigger appetites will eat more, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're eating unhealthy foods. Just like being thin doesn't guarantee that someone is eating healthy, it just means they're eating fewer calories.   People need to eat food high in fiber and nutrients in-order to maintain optimal health. Foods that meet that criteria are overwhelmingly plant-based, and plant-based foods tend to have most of their calories coming from carbs.   The problem with emphasizing one macro-nutrient over the others or saying carbs are bad for you, is that it's demonizing what is undoubtedly the healthiest category of foods: plants.   TL;DR: Eat your veggies."

It does work, but what about it works?  Could another way work better?  Could you get 95% of the benefit and still reverse atherosclerosis by doing things very differently?   or even just a high fat plant-based diet can do the same?   You mean like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pjkC71exKU   What would really make me raise an eyebrow (or two) is to see a study where consumption of meat (at least once a day) or even just a high fat plant-based diet can do the same.  Even short-term consumption of a Paleolithic-type diet improved glucose control and lipid profiles in people with type 2 diabetes compared with a conventional diet containing moderate salt intake, low-fat dairy, whole grains and legumes.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25828624   Esselstyn ... has shown results repeatedly   He showed it work with ~12 people with a ~50% dropout rate.  I haven't heard of him running any other studies or any studies proving which lifestyle interventions (or all of them) were necessary.  Was it the smoking, the exercise, the weight loss, the increased non-starchy veggies, the removal of bread, the elimination of refined sugar, or high omega 6 vegetable oil, stress reduction, or was it the meat and dairy?    A lot is lousy with the standard american diet and that's the problem.  I don't think Esslysten's diet is bad.  I think it's pretty good, but I don't think what he's suggesting is necessary for optimal health.  I think there are plenty of good diets with wildly different macronutrient ratios.  I think the problem is processed foods and that any varied whole foods diet is fine and will have similar effects."

Each may have their benefits, but my bet is that a plant-based diet, low in fat, helps prevent heart disease and ""may"" help to prevent cancer. I have personally tried the Paleo diet, and it, just like any diet, including Esselstyn's, is a prescriptivist diet. Let me say I never felt worse in my life while eating paleo. However, my bet is listening to your own body you can make better choices about what suits you."

Like you, my perception is skewed by personal experience.  I've tried many diets and after a period of time of 4-6 months on each, I test my health markers (lipid scores, glucose, etc).  Best results I ever got was on keto where over 50% of my calories came from fat, 50% of those were saturated.  I was eating 2 pounds of meat a day.  The second best lipid/glucose scores was doing paleo.  I felt the worse doing keto, second worse doing vegan.  I loved a high carb low fat diet and felt great but that gave me the worse health marker scores of all by a wide margin (doctor saying I might need meds at the time), and I then reversed the effects with paleo.  My biggest lesson here is that regardless of how you feel doing a diet, you have to test the results.  How I felt and how I tested were inversely proportional for me."

And I think not fasting regularly is a major cause of cancer   For long periods of time, patients did not eat which significantly lowered their white blood cell counts. In mice, fasting cycles âflipped a regenerative switch, changing the signalling pathways for hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for the generation of blood and immune systems.â  (1)  âLike every other cell, cancer cells need energy to survive and keep growing. But cancer cells are fairly inflexible about how they produce that energy, which gives us a way to target them,â   Cancer cells rely heavily on glucose (sugar) from food for energy â theyâre on overdrive, burning much more glucose than a regular cell to fuel their rapid growth. The phenomenon is called the Warburg effect, named after the German physician who first described it nearly 100 years ago. As such, cancer cells are much more vulnerable to any interruption in supply.  Deprived of glucose, cancer cells rely on an emergency backup â using a type of enzyme called a kinase to continue their growth-related activities.  Longo and his team and collaborators discovered that this metabolic shift by cancer cells causes them to generate toxic-free radicals, which ultimately kills them. In addition, the kinase pathway for generating energy can be blocked by kinase inhibitors, further choking off cancer cellsâ ability to generate energy. Kinase inhibitors are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a cancer treatment, opening the door to using them and fasting as a one-two punch to knock out cancer.   https://news.usc.edu/78953/fasting-and-less-toxic-cancer-drug-could-be-alternative-to-chemotherapy/  I eat one meal per day (23 hour fast with a 1 hour eating window).  I regularly fast 2-3 days without any food.   Let me say I never felt worse in my life while eating paleo.   If you haven't given it a month, then you aren't really burning fat effectively.  It legitimately takes some time to get used to.  If you've given it a fair shot, I'd be very surprised to hear that.  People on paleo rarely talk about problems.  I've run into a few, but then again I run into issues eating much less meat and fat as well.  I have 5 chronic diseases, so anything I do wrong causes a very quick reaction."

I feel wonderful in a diet of cereal, pizza and nachos; this doesn't mean I should eat that.  My best health marker tests came years ago when I did Atkins, yet I felt myserable, so I don't do that either. So I'm doing something now I don't like a lot, but is not too bad, and it's keeping me healthy (close to paleo).  I loved IF and the health scores were great but I'm not exercising as much and working around people who eat a lot around me so I don't think I can do it now (being fasted while people eat a lot right next to me is difficult)."

nutrition,3850zt,tibco91,8,Mon Jun 1 22:17:43 2015 UTC,Keto can do amazing things to blood work. Fats are not actually bad for your cholesterol and at times can even improve it. Do some googling.
nutrition,3850zt,Jarien,4,Tue Jun 2 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"LDL too high, HDL too low, total cholesterol too high and same with triglycerides as well.   Increased triglycerides imply you have trouble with fat metabolism due to excess carbohydrate intake. I recommend keeping net carbohydrates below <120g a day and taking up daily or two-daily fasted low intensity cardio to improve this biomarker. Ketogenic diets work best to lower them, but any low carb diet that forces you to burn fat instead of carbohydrates will do.  Excessive LDL levels can be caused by a multitude of things, it is a fairly nonspecific marker. Weight loss, exercise, trans fats, omega 6 fats, saturated fats can all affect it. Personally I would not worry about it if your diet is in order, you do daily or two-daily exercise, and your other biomarkers are in order.  HDL could be most reliably increased by saturated fat, but that also increases LDL. There may be other ways, I haven't looked into the subject yet.  How is your liver function?   With that said, am I still at a high risk for heart disease later down the road (provided I still exercise and eat well)?   We can't tell that from biomarkers alone.

Perhaps train less and/or more spaced out?  That said, people take Ibuprofen to prevent muscle soreness, but search for studies on the matter before jumping on it. Anti-inflammatory medications might interfere with your muscle gain and have additional side effects.  Alternatively, get on the ketogenic diet.

In the US many of the more desirable jobs in nutrition require the RD credentials. You can get this with a Bachelor's if your Bachelor's program is ACEND-accredited. (This is different from simple regional accreditation, this is accreditation specifically from the Academy.) Then you'd just need the Bachelors, your internship, and the exam.  However if you're like me and go to a school without an ACEND-accredited program you'll need to go to an ACEND-accredited program, which is usually done by people in such a situation as part of a Masters program or a second Bachelor's.  There are nutrition jobs that don't require the RD credential, but it greatly limits your choices if you are in the US."

nutrition,37ylpf,nipar,4,Mon Jun 1 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to take too many electrolytes? Yes, it certainly is. The body is well capable of managing your levels of these minerals on it's own and you're not actually loosing very high amounts of them during exercise.   What happens when you do? All kinds of funky stuff. You'll notice when you do: nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, dizziness etc are on the list of symptoms.  Would taking electrolytes before a workout be effective at all? Yes and no. Electrolytes have been shown to increase the water absorbtion in the intestines. However, you generally don't need to load up with electrolytes before a workout. Drinking regular water before a workout will be enough. I'd save the electrolytes for after workout. Or during, if that would be necessary.   To keep it simple: You can take too many electrolytes. They will help before a workout, but not in such a significant way that taking them pre-workout would in any way outweigh the negative sides of getting too much. Water will do fine here. Stick with regular water before a workout, leave room for electrolytes in moderate amounts for during and after if that will be necessary. Most people wouldn't need them at all as long as their diet is reasonably balanced. But they will boost the water absorbtion rate in your body during a workout and help your recovery post-workout, so they're not bad."

Even people who eat a high fruit diet (fruits are low in protein) eat more than 15 grams of protein a day. Personally protein deficiency is not something western people need to be worried about... amino acid deficiency on the other hand, could definitely be a problem i.e. deficiency in a particular amino acid. Some vegetarian/vegan people can find themselves with a deficiency in methionine or cystine amino acids. The solution to this is to eat a wide variety of foods.   As far as gaining weight, protein could be a culprit in losing mass, because protein is induces anabolic state (gaining mass).

Assuming you are 25 and don't exercise, you should be eating about 2400 calories a day (caculated here: http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/). Out of those calories, you need to make sure you are balancing your macros - namely, getting enough protein, fat, and carbs (fiber). Some people are titchy about carbs and don't like them. I say that's up to you. Make sure you get enough fat, fiber and protein, and whatever you want to do with your leftover calories is fair game.   I'm a big fan of cottage cheese for being something that sticks to your ribs and keeps you going. Lots of protein, although you have to watch what they add to it (sugar and salt can get out of control). I'm also a big fan of eggs, avocados, and greek yogurt for breakfast. Oatmeal and apple sauce, with a little bit of protein powder, is also super quick and easy.   For lunch, I usually eat leftovers for the dinner the night before.

nutrition,37vvmo,erin_rabbit,1 point,Sun May 31 10:08:28 2015 UTC,Why do you need fiber?
nutrition,37vvmo,dupilumab,2,Sun May 31 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"A bunch of reasons! First and foremost, fiber is essential for digestive health. It keeps your system moving at the rate it should be, and can help ward off a ton of digestive issues (including constipation).   It also helps you feel fuller longer and evens out blood sugar, which makes it easier to keep yourself at a healthy weight (and helps prevent insulin spikes, which is good for people trying to manage diabetes).   There's also evidence that it can help prevent some types of colorectal cancer, along with helping lower 'bad' cholesterol.   It's important to note that there are two different types of fiber, and it's important to get a balance of both.    Soluble fiber slows digestion (which makes you feel full, regulates blood sugar, and helps manage LDL cholesterol) and is found in things like oats, lentils & beans, nuts, flaxseeds, apples, carrots, and psyllium.  Insoluble fiber keeps your digestive system moving, and adds bulk (which helps prevent constipation and other constipation-related issues). It's found mostly in whole grains and vegetables.    Women under 50 need about 25g of fiber a day, and men under 50 need about 38g a day (people over 50 need less fiber). The average Westerner gets far less than that."
nutrition,37vvmo,erin_rabbit,1 point,Sun May 31 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"As someone who does zero carb, I don't eat fiber and I have less digestive and bowel issues than I did before. I've never felt constipated or anything. Fat takes care of that. I'm definitely not going to start eating fiber because of this information, but I do think it is interesting what you have said! I didn't know about the other things it did like perhaps helping to prevent some cancers and lowering bad cholesterol. I appreciate you writing this out. It's certainly interesting to see how different things can work for different people, as I have heard many people say fiber is great for them but all it does is cause me discomfort."
nutrition,37vvmo,dupilumab,2,Sun May 31 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"Whatever works for you!  What does your zero carb diet look like? In my experience, everyone does their low carb diets differently, but I haven't ran into many that are low fiber.  Fiber is a bit of a tricky thing sometimes because it can cause digestive upset if you eat too much too fast. Basically, your body doesn't digest fiber (it passes it relatively intact), so eating a lot when your body isn't used to it can cause digestive upset. That said, if your body is used to a ton of fiber, it causes very little (if any) problems.   The other thing is that it's SUPER important to drink water when you eat lots of fiber, especially soluble fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel type substance. If you don't drink enough water to go along with that it can cause major constipation (one of my professors at university described it like spackle)."

You're no longer eating one food, but a mixture of foods. The baked potato may come with meat and vegetables, and with butter on top.  You might think that a weighted average of the GI of the various foods might give a good indication of the GI of the meal. Then, since fat, meat, and vegetables have a low GI, youâd expect GI of the meal to be much lower.  It turns out that the GI of meals is low â in fact, it is even lower than the average GI of the foods composing the meal.

A ketogenic diet certainly has a different nutrient composition than a  high carb plant diet for example, or even a SAD diet. A huge difference is the amount of carbohydrates, which people on a ketogenic diet deprive themselves of. Carbohydrate is the preferred source of energy in humans. The mere fact that the body will use glycogen for energy when given a reasonable amount of carbohydrate (lets say around 50-100g). The fact that a nutrient is essential is a good reason to get enough of it, but not a good reason to consume too much of it. The fact that we need enough omega 3 fatty acids to create DHA and EPA is not a good reason to eat 75% of yer calories from fat. The same can be said for protein, for example an excess in some amino acids is bad for the body. The same can be said for some vitamins and minerals too, especially if they are in isolated form.

Further, there is anecdotal evidence from many thousands who have been on low carb, high fat (LCHF) diets for a decade or more while enjoying the best health of their lives.  At this point, the typical anti-keto rhetoric will bring up studies that last all of two or three days, point out that it made people uncomfortable and/or raised inflammation markers, and feel they won. It is well known it a takes a couple weeks to convert form from being a sugar-burner to being a fat-burner. Volek showed that the long-term impact was a significant reduction in CRP. Given extra weight is stored as fat, why the hell would a person want to prime their body for burning sugar?!   There are no nutrients in carb-rich foods that are not greater in quantity and more bio-available in foods rich in fats (e.g. meat, preferably with some offal) combined with vegetables. Grains, starches, and most fruit are pathetic sources of nutrition while causing blood sugar spikes and dips that drive hunger and overeating.  Like Dr Richard Feinman (medical biology professor at one of the SUNY medical schools) says, ""if you are ok, you are ok"", meaning that if you are not having health problems as a result of your diet, then you don't need to change, but if you are having metabolic problems, including visceral fat accumulation, high blood pressure, poor blood lipids, high blood sugars, PCOS, or diabetes among others, then you are not ok and a LCHF diet will almost certainly improve your health.  If you just want to lose 5-10 pounds and you are otherwise healthy, you don't have the medical imperative to reduce carbohydrate (though you may be on the leading edge of metabolic problems listed above), but it can still provide a much more pleasant dieting experience, and, if you keep eating fairly low carb (but keto isn't necessarily required), you are more likely to keep it off."
nutrition,37vvju,SoftwareMaven,8,Sun May 31 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"1st of all, cook all your meals. They should consist of a lean protein source such as chicken, turkey, or fish. Use seasonings to add flavor instead of butter, cheese, or dressings. Your sides should be mostly veggies; corn, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, etc. You can also do grains; brown rice, quinoa, beans. Snacks should be fruits, more veggies, or small portions of nuts. Careful of what you're drinking as well. I like sparkling water with some fresh lime or lemon juice added."

nutrition,37vvju,atomofconsumption,1 point,Sun May 31 06:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're asking what kind of healthy fats are out there.   Fats can be divided into 4 categories. Polyunsaturated (healthy, include omega 3s) monounsaturated (healthy), saturated (controversial), and trans (universally considered unhealthy).   Two quick and dirty guides to tell ""healthy fat"" from ""unhealthy fat"".  1. If it's liquid at room temp it's probably healthy.  2. If it's a plant based fat, it's probably healthy.   Sources of healthy fats include avocados, nuts, unsaturated vegetable oils, and fatty fish."

nutrition,37vvju,Itcomesinacan,5,Sat May 30 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why the other poster was being downvoted, aiming to be below 1300 is likely too low a calorie goal based upon your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). Apps like myfitnesspal and the like are notorious for undercounting how many calories a person needs to be healthy or lose weight. I'm not sure how much you know, so forgive me if you already know all this.   When calculating your daily calorie requirements, there are two different measures that are good to look at - your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and your TDEE.   Your BMR is just how many calories it takes for you to stay alive, run all your organs, etc. It does not take into account any physical movement at all (as far as it's concerned, you are lying in bed in the exact same position all day). Because this number is just a baseline ""lets not die"" number, it isn't very useful when calculating weight loss.   Your TDEE is whatever calories you burn in a day (so BMR + actually having a life). THIS is the number you want to use when you're looking at losing weight.  If you want to lose weight in a healthy and sustainable weight, eating 80-85% of your TDEE is the best way to go about it (you can eat less than %80 of your TDEE if you are really ambitious, but I don't recommend it for health reasons unless you consult with your doctor).    So what does this mean for you? I ran some example calculations to show you.    Since you didn't list your age or activity level, I'm going to arbitrarily put in that you are 25 and sedentary.    Your BMR is 1336. Your TDEE is 1663.  Based upon your goals to lose weight, %80 of your TDEE brings you to needing approximately 1330 calories a day (assuming you are actually 25 and do not engage in any physical activity).   I strongly recommend calculating your TDEE for yourself, especially if you engage in any physical activity whatsoever.    In my experience, when people are having a really hard time staying under their calorie goals, it's because their calorie goals are too restrictive for their own bodies (barring unhealthy habits).   Here are some links to calculate your own calorie needs.   http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/  http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/  http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/ (my favourite because it's so easy)"

I'll type it below so maybe you can get an idea for meals? I realize you're allergic to fish, which is my lunches and dinner but beef works as a good alternate.  Breakfast - Smoothie consisting of: 1 cup skim milk, 1 cup tropical fruit blend (Great Value brand from Walmart), 1 scoop Gold's Banana cream protein powder, either a spoon of natural PB or a banana, and a boiled egg on the side (or sometimes I just blend it into the smoothie raw).  Lunch - Salad of 2 cups Veggie Mix, 1 cup spinach (Fresh Express brand from Walmart), 1 sweet green pepper cut up and either a can of tuna or a basa fillet on the side.  Dinner - 1 Basa fillet/~150-200g Salmon with 1-1.5 cups cubed butternut squash and 1/2-1cup broccoli.

nutrition,37vvju,theartofthespy,2,Sun May 31 03:40:33 2015 UTC,"yeah, 700-800 is too much for dinner. You're going to have to spread out your calories more evenly and not have one hefty dinner as you may be used to. One way I used to do it is: 8:30am Breakfast 200-300 calories. 12pm Lunch 200-300 calories. 2pm Snack 100-150 calories. 6pm Dinner 400-600 calories.   So best case scenario you might have up to 790 calories for dinner. Or 600 calories for dinner and 190 for dessert. Any calories you save earlier in the day go towards dinner and dessert. To help fill your belly make sure you choose high protein breakfast/lunch/snacks and like others said, healthy fats. Also, no-calorie drinks or very low calorie drinks to help fill you up between your meal/snack times. Also, little pre-portioned candies or popsicles that are under 50 calories can also help you through to the next food time.  And of course it's going to be easier if you exercise for 30-45 minutes to burn a couple hundred calories so you can eat that much more.  Just look at your regular meals and think about ways to reduce the calories - less sauce, less oil, less bread, less condiments, smaller portions. It's like making a financial budget, you try to cut down where you can. If you drink any of your calories, that is an easy step right there."

Then a quarter of your plate for meat, and a quarter for a source of carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. If you drink soda or fruit juice, cutting these out can make a huge difference to caloric intake - have diet sodas (a controversial solution as a lot of people believe sweeteners are bad for you, but its your choice), plain or carbonated water with a bit of lemon or lime to add flavour, and if you drink tea and coffee, don't add sugar or cream.

Because weight loss/weight gain/weight maintenance is mostly related to how much calorie you eat. (3500 calorie deficit creates one pound of fat loss theoretically).  Once I have my macro goal based upon my calorie. I would go buy healthy food that fits in carb, fat and protein category.  For example, I would always buy chicken breast, turkey breast, lean ground beef, lean pork chop, lean fish, egg whites as my protein source. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruits, vegetables, beans, pasta, rice as my carb source. Nut butters, olive oil, butter, coconut oil, nuts, seeds, eggs as my fat source.   I cook all of the food on Sunday. I bake meat plain (with some salt, pepper, other seasonings) and if I bake meat with fat, I record how much oil/butter I use. I also cook my rice, pasta, or bake my potatoes. So during the week, I have my protein source and carb source cooked. Fat sources are easily added whenever I need them. When I am out, I would bring a container with certain amount of meat, carb and fat with me based upon my macro needs.   Hopefully it helps!

You have to find the right one for you.  Explain what it is that you're looking for from them and determine if they're compatible. Sometimes it's even possible to do this over the phone, so you wouldn't even necessarily have to pay. No guarantees on that one, though. Make sure you don't let them just phone it in when they're with you, which is sort of what it sounds like has happened in the past.   As a side note that isn't directed specifically at you, in order for someone to become a diet professional, they have to study a lot more than just macros.

We have to be exact on everything for fear of litigation by consumers.  1.5 because it's not 2 full servings and you can legally put certain breakdowns with .5 increment.  I'd also like to say I work in processed food which is FDA governed and didn't take the time to go re-learn all the USDA rules, which vary slightly, and can't spend the time right now.  You want to start to explore the FDA/USDA Code of Federal Relations a.k.a CFR if you want to understand all the rules, but there are roudning rules for everything that goes on the label and beyond that rules for what ingredients you can use, how you label ingredients, what ingredients you don't have to label due to amounts used, or sub components that do not need to be there.  For the numbers we mark everything conservatively and if you are going to do your own math, you can easily keep your own exact correct numbers with a scale, a calculator and google.  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm"

If something has less than 5 calories, it can be labelled as 0 Calories.  See all sugar free gum!  Sometimes labelled <5 Calories or 0 Calories."
nutrition,37sp75,BourbonZawa,2,Tue Jun 2 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"From fda.gov (sorry having trouble linking to the PDF file, on mobile and the file just downloads and won't let me copy the URL.)   The Third Group nutrients include calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. However, for products (e.g., fruit drinks, juices, and confectioneries) with a sugars content of 90 percent or more of total carbohydrate, to prevent labeling anomalies due in part to rounding, FDA treats total carbohydrate as a Third Group nutrient instead of a Class II nutrient. For foods with label declarations of Third Group nutrients, the ratio between the amount obtained by laboratory analysis and the amount declared on the product label in the Nutrition Facts panel must be 120% or less, i.e., the label is considered to be out of compliance if the nutrient content of a composite of the product is greater than 20% above the value declared on the label. For example, if a laboratory analysis found 8 g of total fat/serving in a product that stated that it contained 6 g of total fat/serving, the ratio between the laboratory value and the label value would be (8 / 6) x 100 = 133%, and the product label would be considered to be out of compliance.   TL;DR, 20%   Edit: still having trouble but this might help: 21 CFR 101.9(g) maybe 3/4 down the page, search ""20 percent""."

There isn't a specific plan as far as macros go or anything else like that, so it's not like a keto diet in that regard.  You just remove all gluten from what you eat.  You can eat super healthy on a gluten free diet and you can also eat crap all day long.  The main things you'll be removing is regular bread, pasta and cereals (anything made with flour).  Some people remove them completely, some people replace them with gluten-free alternatives.  You also need to watch for gluten that is used as a thickener in many sauces and such.  For example, soy sauce has gluten, so you have to buy the alternative tamari sauce instead (tastes the same to me).  I suggest you find a healthy, balanced eating plan that has fresh fruits and veggies, lean protein and healthy fats.  Eat unprocessed foods as much as possible.  Good luck with it.

nutrition,37pk0f,LadyVictoria,11,Fri May 29 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"I reckon my appetite a year ago would be able to give yours some competition.  I asked my General Practitioner the same thing ""why am I so insatiably hungry"", and he had no answer for me but sent me to endocrinology specialists.    The answer for me turned out to be reactive hypoglycemia, caused by an underlying insulin resistance and an intake rich in carbohydrates.  My insulin rose too slowly after eating, my pancreas over produced insulin, and my muscle cells didn't clear glucose quickly enough when there was insulin - so eventually the insulin drove my blood glucose too low, and my brain sent me an urgent message to go buy it a candy bar STAT.    Long story short - a ketogenic diet fixed my inability to regulate my energy.  I switched to fueling mostly on Fat, a modest amount of protein and the only carbs I eat now are in low-carb vegetables.  I  now eat a quarter (calorically) of what I used to.  100g of meat and about 150g of vegetables is a satiating meal."

The thing that makes me call them ""episodes"" is that the change in my hunger level would happen so QUICKLY. One time I was riding the bus on my lunch break down to a restaurant, and I went from ""pretty hungry; could eat"" to ""I AM DYING WHERE ARE THE DONUTS"" complete with shaky hands, sweaty pits, fuzzy vision, and weakness all in a matter of less than 5 minutes.   I got off the bus early, staggered into a Popeye's Chicken (I'm not proud), purchased four buttermilk biscuits, and ate them all standing outside on the sidewalk. Then I felt like shit for the rest of the day.  Like I said, this doesn't happen much anymore, but every once in a while I still get a mild version of this feeling: a bit panicky, must-eat-now with some shakes.

nutrition,37pk0f,anbeav,6,Fri May 29 15:21:35 2015 UTC,"So, there are a couple of ways our body feels ""full.""  You are getting lots of calories, but not a lot of volume.   Our stomach has stretch receptors that let us know when it is physically full, which curbs hunger.   Oil is very calorie dense (and low on nutrients) but takes up virtually no space.  Fats and proteins are great at stimulating the release of CCK which prevents out stomach from emptying quickly.    But you want to feel full.  This is where high volume, high (micronutrient), low calorie food comes in.   Veggies, especially raw: romaine, cauliflower, etc. potatoes and sweet potatoes, beans, squash, apples, whole grain foods, and so on.    Have a romaine salad with garbanzos, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, avocado.  Have corn tortillas with brown rice, black beans, kale, guacamole.  Munch on popcorn.  So scale back on the high calorie foods, eat virtually unlimited amounts of nutrient dense, low calorie foods.  Never be hungry."

If you are used to have a snack in the afternoon, you will usually notice when you skip it and get a craving. Also slight boredom makes me think about food and there are certain repeating triggers like watching a tv show or whatever that makes you think of food because you often get a snack while or after doing this.  When I am at home at the computer I am more likely to think about food about every two hours. On the other hand when I go for a day of motocross I have breakfast at 9AM and won't think about food before 6PM. When I went to university I had three meals a day without snacks and it was totally fine because I was used to the schedule.  So if you think this is a problem you can train yourself to eat at specific times. Additionally you can try to identify triggers that make you think of food and then replace the food with something else like making a coffee or whatever.  Often the desire to eat something is confused with being hungry. You can go a long time before being really hungry but we usually don't do that and maybe lose the connection with that feeling."

TBH, the above meal would be quite small for me, but I am a male that works out quite often so my viewpoint probably isn't normal.

Make sure you're drinking enough fluid with it so the fibre can do its job (it absorbs fluid), but from what you've said all the nutrients you need are there.  You're a healthy weight and active, so eating a lot shouldn't be a bad thing if it's all good stuff. Carbohydrates are really important for giving us energy, especially for how active you are, so it's probably not more than necessary if it's what your body needs.   Yeah, I think using My Fitness Pal will be really good alongside assessing how hungry you get... hopefully you'll get a bit more insight :)"

Anitschov performed studies constricting, cutting, pulling, and burning the rabbit's blood vessels, by severing their nerves, and by injecting them with chemicals like digitalin, strophanthin, adonidin, ergotin, theocin, barium chloride, hydrastin, nicotine, and formalin. While many of these methods resulted in arterial damage and thickening none of them resulted in the type of arterial plaque seen in human atherosclerosis.

nutrition,37lman,Ziggo001,13,Thu May 28 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"If you are in survival mode it's because your body is burning more calories than are being taken in, which necessarily means it will be impossible for you to gain weight.  What will happen if you take in too high of a caloric deficit is that your body will eventually downregulate your metabolism to decrease the amount of calories you need. Obviously this cannot happen in perpetuity as your body will begin to break down muscle tissue for energy needs and that is eventually fatal.  Your body doesn't ""anticipate starvation."" It's in anabolic or catabolic modes, one of which involves building structures (such as fat/muscle mass) or catabolic, which involves breaking those structures down (fat/muscle mass)."

nutrition,37lman,Tall_LA_Bull,4,Thu May 28 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"No.  Eat fewer calories and increase activity.  The most common mistake is not counting calories in or being way off on calories burned.  Eating 3 or 4 small snacks can add 1000 calories to your day.  It may feel like eating a little each time, but its the same as adding a second large dinner."

nutrition,37lman,billsil,5,Thu May 28 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"No. It's flatly untrue. If you starve yourself for long enough and lose a tremendous amount of weight, your body may enter starvation mode, and you will burn less calories per day. But that will only slow your loss of weight. You can never gain large amounts of weight while eating at a caloric deficit. Against the laws of physics.  In my opinion, if you want to lose weight, the best thing you can do is count calories. It worked for me, because it gave me a sense of control and measurable progress that I never had before. I no longer had to constantly be asking myself ""Is this okay to eat?"" because I could just look at how many calories it had and how many my budget was for the day. The answer to my ""should I or shouldn't I"" question was as simply as addition.  Now, it's humbling to realize how many calories are in some of the bad crap you're eating. That part is hard. But if you can accept the reality of that, counting calories is a great way to lose weight."

I've done a 6 day, no food fast.  My gut was upset and I was sick of it hurting, so I stopped eating until it calmed down.  I lost 12 pounds.  Since I was already on a low carb diet, there wasn't that much water weight.  I felt great during the fast, but once it was over, my energy levels tanked.  I put all the weight back on in a month without consciously counting calories.  Once I got back to my old weight, my energy levels shot back up.  You evolved to be able to handle extended fasts.  We are one of the fattest mammals on the planet and by far the fattest primates.  I don't think our bodies would have messed up calories in-out."

It's probably more useful to think ""we could improve our chances by doing X"" - you can probably find one thing that contains a lot of salt that you wouldn't mind not eating any more, so giving that up would be an easy way to improve your health.  If you just want reassurance here are two references:  1) We probably aren't ALL doomed, because there is probably a genetic component to the salt-blood pressure interaction - see e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495127 ""Genomic epidemiology of blood pressure salt sensitivity."" - but that won't help you personally, because you won't know if you are salt sensitive or not.  2) It is even possible that salt isn't the major problem http://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000167.full ""The wrong white crystals: not salt but sugar as aetiological in hypertension and cardiometabolic disease""  Personally I'd start by going for salmon that had just been frozen, not preserved - I happen to like it better that way anyway."

A more recent study showed that 3-6 grams of sodium, or more specifically, 4-5 grams are optimal in terms of cardiovascular events and mortality. Less than 3 grams is associated with a sharp increase in cardiovascular events and mortality, more than 6 is associated with a more sloped increase. The average american consumes about 3.5 grams, so doomsayers about excessive sodium consumption are quite wrong.  Too low sodium intake can trigger the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, dumping potassium in an effort to preserve sodium. My hypothesis is that with lower amounts of both sodium and potassium, it is much easier to upset their balance, and cause complications with dietary intake.  The RDA for sodium and potassium can not be met simultaneously. [1]  The RDA for sodium is out of touch and dangerous."

The thing is, just like other health professionals, it might take some work on your part to find someone who has experience relevant to your situation and a personality that you can deal with.   Your digestive system is fucked and your bowels are gone, which means that a healthy diet for you is something entirely different than it is for someone without your obstacles. Things that are good for someone without the same issues that you have (kale, for example) are not good for you, as evidenced by how much time you spend on the toilet following their consumption.

I'd say follow everyone else's advice and find a specialist who has a better idea of your obstacles.   But the juicing might be worth a shot, you get the fresh nutrient dense foods and turn them into a smooth liquid to help supplement the food you can eat. A regular regime of probiotics to assist in digestion and possibly a natural anti inflammatory like pineapple or bromelain supplement derived from pineapple might help too.

If you are going to agree with the previous user in that it will be biased ""because humans are involved"" then that makes the use of the word biased and non-biased defunct. Humans have always been involved in the production of textbooks and books and so will always be biased. If any form of information produced by humans will always be biased, then the word itself is pointless as it will always be there and so pointing it out is unnecessary as it should be assumed, much the same as it is assumed that a human has a head.   The way I see it, you can either admit that the words biased and nonbiased are defunct, OR, you can point out how the book I am referring to is biased."

There are arguments on the width of this window however. I have seen values ranging from a few hours to even 24+ hours.

nutrition,37j4ae,lifeandall,1 point,Thu May 28 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"Starches aren't ""bad"" on paleo.  It's recommended you generally limit if you have a lot of weight to lose (low blood sugar -> hunger).  I currently have a BMI of 20.5.  I can afford a few pounds.  Dr. Loren Cordain, the guy who really came up the idea of paleo, took a few liberties when creating the ""rules"".  If you're cutting potatoes, you might as well cut tomatoes and peppers as well (they're all nightshades).  Cordain did not take cooking into account in his analysis, so yeah, don't eat the skin raw (it's toxic when raw), but who does that?  Potatoes are arguably more nutrient dense than sweet potatoes (e.g. more potassium), though lower in beta-carotene.  Retinol is not hard to come by on paleo so I'm not really concerned; preformed vitamin A/retinol is superior to beta-carotene anyways.    Starches calm my gut down in a way that fruit does not.  You need to learn to listen to your body.  If something isn't working, you owe it to yourself to change things up.  My gut didn't behave on SAD (I was 5'10"" and 115 pounds with a BMI of 16.5).  It was fine for 2 years on paleo and then started acting up again (not as bad though).  I added more starches, gained back 20 pounds, and feel good again."

I was 220+ lbs, and slow and tired and in lots of chronic pain.  The biggest suggestions would be to 1) replace all carbs (sugar, white flour, etc.) with whole grains, beans, and fruits; 2) replace your current fat intake with coconut, nuts, rice bran oil, high quality butter, and extra virgin olive oil; and 3) ensure adequate protein via fish, high quality meat ('lean' or not, beef or chicken, etc., doesn't really matter in my opinion), 2 or more pastured eggs a day; 4) vegetables of all sorts, mostly cooked.  I'd also take fish oil and/or wild salmon to round things out.  Sample breakfast: oatmeal with nuts and banana with an egg or two, soymilk, and/or high quality CLA-rich milk. Sample lunch: whole grain sandwich with cheese, meat, lettuce. Dinner: wild salmon with roasted squash, sweet potato, peas, carrots, bell peppers, drizzled with a good amount of EVOO, with the food items cooked in rice bran oil, with a nice big mixed leaf salad. (I eat salad with nothing on it, taking handfuls from a big bowl.) You can munch on all sorts of fruit, coconut, and similar stuff in between.

Sorry, I'm just new to actually caring about all this stuff so I'm still learning a lot about it. Is it a good idea to switch it up something like cashew milk or something rather than dairy for oatmeal and the like?"
nutrition,37ibwe,ARNutrition,1 point,Wed May 27 22:16:29 2015 UTC,"By high-quality meats I mean organic, and especially pasture-raised. So, 100% grass-fed beef (preferably organic), wild salmon, pastured eggs, pastured chicken... to be honest, the 'type' of meat doesn't really matter, as long as it's raised properly. Just have some balance.  This of course excludes pretty much all cold cuts, salamis, etc. It's best if you get raw meat/fish, and prepare it yourself. At 20, I forced myself to learn to cook, and it took a while, but I really love my meals now - and so do others.  It's good to switch things up. Cashew milk has nutritional factors that soymilk doesn't, and a good-quality whole milk yogurt has stuff that neither have. Throughout the week, I have nuts, soymilk, coconut milk/cream, straight dairy... nothing dominates, which ensures that good things prevail.  Mixed green leaves are a good addition. And by that I mean arugula, kale, chard, romaine, spring mix, and 'butter' lettuce. Avoid iceberg, as it's almost worthless nutritionally. Mixed greens are concentrated, nutritionally, and although they look 'empty' on a nutrition label, they have thousands of known and unknown chemicals that keep the body healthy. Remember, the nutrition label gives you a tiny snapshot of what's in food. A food label will tell you that a piece of extra dark organic chocolate is equivalent to a tablespoon of ""fractionated palm kernel oil,"" although one is good for you, and the other should never be eaten.  If you have a Trader Joe's near you, shop there. Organic soymilk runs for less than $2, and tastes as good as choice soybeans in Asia. Organic, grass-fed beef runs for $7-8, organic whole milk yogurt is $2.50 for a quart, and they sell raw cheese -- which is better than organic, but quite cheap because it lacks the 'organic' label.   Also, many extra virgin olive oils are a sham, since they're adulterated with refined vegetable oils. Yet Trader Joe's sells really good quality EVOO that runs as cheap as $8 for a large 32 oz container. Much cheaper than any supermarket, and much better for you. I dip their whole grain breads into platefuls of EVOO throughout the week as a snack."
nutrition,37ibwe,danbukowskidotnet,2,Thu May 28 01:03:14 2015 UTC,"Iâd say the most important starting points would be, focus on eating as many unprocessed whole foods as possible, e.g. fruit and vegetables, whole grains like rice, oats, legumes like beans and lentils, fresh meat and fish, some dairy; and try and prepare as much food as you can at home from scratch. This should get you thinking more about what youâre eating. Experiment with different foods and go for things you enjoy, not what the latest fad is telling you is the healthy way to eat. Plus drink plenty of water and try and avoid drinks with added sugars.  To make changes gradually you could maybe change one meal at a time? So focus on eating a healthy breakfast first. This may then impact on the choices you make for the rest of day and it should hopefully feel like a more natural adjustment."

nutrition,37ffyi,dreiter,2,Wed May 27 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about keratosis pilaris, but 100,000 IU is way too much vitamin A if it is coming from retinoids. Hypervitaminosis A is caused from excessive intake of retinoids (>3 mg / >10,000 IU per day), which can eventually increase the risk of bone fracture, birth defects, and liver failure. So I would not recommend supplementing with vitamin A in the form of retinoids.  However, the intake of plant-based carotenoids (provitamin A) will not cause hypervitaminosis A because the body tightly controls conversion of carotenoids to retinoids. The key here is getting mixed carotenoids from plant-based sources, and avoiding isolated beta-carotene which is linked to an increased risk of cancer.  Carrots, butternut squash, pumpkin, watermelon, tomatoes... are all a very good source of plant-based carotenoids. So I would focus on these foods, and drop the vitamin A supplements you are currently take because they are probably either retinoids or isolated beta-carotene -- neither of which are beneficial."

How much sleep you get and the quality of that sleep can dictate how your hormones act during the day. Your hormones will dictate eating habits until you have them under control. Sleep better and at the same times each day (weekends too) and you should feel more energetic, and naturally eat better.   Sleepy minds don't make great choices as any college student can attest.  Remove triggers for yourself from the house and surround yourself with whole foods.  And make habits of going out and doing things with friends that do not involve food.  Hiking/camping/ DIY projects.  You brain will make positive associations with non food activities.

The broad take away that the interaction between the types of food and your body is much more complicated than ""a calorie is a calorie"".

For many people, they are eating more calories than they use because they are getting fatter, not the other way around.  You can always force weight loss the way you've suggested, but that leads to hunger and lethargy. And it often gets harder over time because your basal rate drops to compensate. It's why people see-saw diet and why diets fail so often.  Also, what you said about weight gain isn't so straightforward. Depending on what kind of food you're eating, you might simply expand more energy (literally feel and be more energetic) rather than store it all into fat.

Well, more activity means more burned calories - meaning you are not really on a surplus.  I agree that its kind of dynamic and intake affects expenditure, but if your intake is higher than use, you will gain weight no matter what."
nutrition,37ccjm,crab_shak,2,Wed May 27 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"We're definitely agreeing on the immutable laws of thermodynamics (I get that being more energetic means more calories are burnt and it may cause a maintenance or deficit).   I think my position, along with the alternative hypotheses to obesity are very subtly different, which is why it causes so much misunderstanding.  The best way to put it is how Gary Taubes explains it when people challenge his knowledge of thermodynamics (even though he has a physics degree from Harvard):   Say instead of talking about why fat tissue accumulates too much energy, we want to know why a particular restaurant gets so crowded. Now the energy weâre talking about is contained in entire people rather than just the fat in their fat tissue. Ten people contain so much energy; eleven people contain more, etc.. So what we want to know is why this restaurant is crowded and so over-stuffed with energy (i.e., people) and maybe why some other restaurant down the block has remained relatively empty â lean. If you asked me this question â why did this restaurant get crowded? â and I said, well, the restaurant got crowded (it got overstuffed with energy) because more people entered the restaurant than left it, youâd probably think I was being a wise guy or an idiot. (If I worked for the World Health Organization, Iâd tell you that âthe fundamental cause of the crowded restaurant is an energy imbalance between people entering on one hand, and people exiting on the other hand.â) Of course, more people entered than left, youâd say. Thatâs obvious. But why? And, in fact, saying that a restaurant gets crowded because more people are entering than leaving it is redundant âsaying the same thing in two different ways â and so meaningless.   So to frame weight loss as a calorie imbalance is obvious and meaningless information. The only way that the calorie imbalance itself (as defined by how much you chose to eat of whatever and how much you choose exercise of however) could be the direct cause (not just a necessary criteria) is if:    Appetite is fixed and independent of the types of food you eat  The types of food you eat has no impact on the availability of energy and your hormonal environment  The type and amount of exercise you do has little impact on appetite and availability of energy   In other words, you would have to assume that each term in the energy balance formula is completely independent and it's purely a psychological game in ignoring hunger and forcing exercise, while hoping your basal rate doesn't drop too much (as that would require even more starvation and forced exercise). Not only does this model of weight gain/loss seem silly, it's tried, tested, and has largely failed (as evidence by the prevalence of obesity and the ineffectiveness of most diets).  The craziest part is that the research is extremely limited in terms of the impact of various foods on the drivers of satiety and fat mobilization, despite the sad state of affairs. The little research there is out there does suggest that the impact is there. If you look at the leaders in the field of obesity research, they actually unanimously agree the type of food has an impact beyond just the calories it contributes.  Christopher Gardner, who is a vegetarian, did the famous A to Z diet study that showed large variations in diet performance regardless of conscious calorie restriction (namely Atkins and Ornish diets, which are polar opposites of each other and both don't count calories, did significantly better than the other diets). Gardner, Ornish, and Atkins all agree that refined carbohydrates have far reaching impacts on satiety and energy availability. They start differing in opinions when it gets to protein and fat, but my point is even with the current, limited research, there are ample reasons to believe calories aren't the first thing to worry about."

This excerpt from the link is what I'm arguing:   Conventional wisdom, perhaps better referred to as Current Dogma, says that you gain weight because you eat more than you expend.  This is almost true!  To be 100% true, it would read: when you gain weight, it is the case that you have necessarily eaten more than you expended.   Do you see the difference? Itâs subtle but very important â arguably more important than any other sentence I will write.  The first statement says over-eating caused you to get fat. The second one says if you got fat, you overate, but the possibility remains that another factor led to you to overeat.   I don't see why this seems so crazy to people."

For example, you eat a 400 calorie cookie in one meal. Low in calories? Yeah, if it is eaten alone. Nutritious? Absolutely not, if compared to a great <400cal salad with dark greens and vegetables/fruits, topped with seeds that are packed with good fats, etc.   When I advise people on weight loss, I tell them to try the following: drink a lot of water (<2 l/day to transform good nutrients in your body into all the fatty parts), spread meals into smaller and more frequent ones (your body stops storing fat once it knows it will have smaller portions more often), put most your calories in the morning (to give your body a signal that it will be well nourished, not starved, thus no need to accumulate fat storages), try to find the right activity to stay healthy (why not have a 3 min vigorous dance?).

I put a spice mix in a bowl, dip the chicken, put the chicken on a pan, preheat the oven for 375, and cook for 20 minutes.  The meat is juicy. I store it in the fridge with a label of the date I cooked and eat on it for a week.  I wouldn't use one source for protein. If you don't like chicken, use it for dinner or lunch only. You can also use eggs (highest quality protein). Breakfast you can fry them up with some Pam or olive oil (depends on how much fat you want) or you could hard boil them for on the go.  GOMAD is fine, but you have to be active. That depends on what your day job is. If you work in an office, I'd be very, very careful about this approach.

Did your doctor explain why they are giving you this vs. just having you lower your sodium intake?    Cutting salt out of your diet is done exactly how you've stated. Usually the best way to go low sodium is to simply cook all of your own meals. A lot of store bought stuff is low fat (because the market hasn't caught up with the fact that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with fat), so in order to mask the loss of flavour (fat = taste), they load it up with salt and/or sugar.  I think you've mostly answered your own question and are just afraid to start and/or are locked into habits of eating and buying food. To me it sounds more like a mindset thing rather than a total lack of knowledge or know-how. Try some new recipes... eat more raw foods, etc. You may wish to investigate something like the paleo diet or some variant thereof. Salt isn't inherently bad, but there is such a thing as too much."

I am currently doing research on how timing of food intake affects diet quality and body weight, and I will go against the trend in this thread and say yes, timing could affect weight loss.   BUT, there is a big but here. The way timing of food intake affects your metabolism can be different from individual to individual. This is controlled by your circadian clock, which is basically a complex system of hormones that organizes how our bodies behave in respect to the hour of the day. This is the reason why while some people are perfectly good being up all night and sleeping during the day, most humans have a diurnal pattern.   Rather than having a heavier breakfast it seems that having light dinners, no night snacking and well distributed diurnal meals is the best option.  As some people have pointed out, there could be a behavioral component that could affect diet quality. People who eat more at night don't really want to cook, and prefer less healthy options, etc.  Some studies to back up my answer are:   Wang, 2013: ""these results suggest that eating more of the dayâs total energy intake midday is associated with a lower risk of being overweight or obese, whereas eating more of the dayâs total energy intake during the evening is associated with a higher risk of being overweight or obese. These associations remain unchanged even after adjusting for physical activity and total daily energy intake or when limiting the sample to participants who had fairly accurately reported their total energy intake.""

I find that if I eat enough throughout the day, I'm not very hungry for dinner. Doing it the other way around is difficult physically and mentally--you're waiting all day to ""spend"" the majority of your calories...after being super hungry all day, and then using those calories for nothing but sleep!

nutrition,378gyv,unknownkoger,1 point,Tue May 26 13:07:58 2015 UTC,"I think the main issue here is looking at what you want your food to be doing for you. Breakfast is the first meal you have after not having food for 8 (more or less) hours. This also has to get you through until a mid day meal. It should be substantial, and provide enough energy so that your body isn't struggling to keep up with your morning activities. Lunch should also be substantial, because again, it has to provide energy for the rest of the day, until your evening meal. By the time you hit dinner, you don't need any more energy, your body should be winding down, and therefore, you shouldn't need as much or as many calories. You also don't want your body stuck trying to digest a massive meal when you are trying to go to sleep.   Food serves a purpose as fuel for your body. You have to look at what kind of fuel you need and what activities you'll be doing. Someone who works out in the morning will need more fuel early, as opposed to someone who works out at night."

Yes, you should limit saturated fats in the diet (since they replace more beneficial fats such as mono fats and high omega-3 fats). You should definitely limit added sugars and processed foods, but that does not mean to restrict healthy sources of carbs like beans, whole grains, and fresh fruits.  Overall, choose veggies, fruits, legumes, nuts, and lean meats if you are a meat-eater.  Stay away from refined oils, refined carbs, and processed foods.  Salt and cholesterol aren't a big concern unless you have certain risk factors."

If you get on a ""optimal"" diet that you have a hard time sustaining and eventually quit, you're doing yourself a disservice.  Now for an anecdote.  Years ago I went on a bet against two friends to see who would show the most improvement on a diet.  One did vegan, one did pescatarian, while I did Atkins.  We measured our health markers with our healthcare providers, then did 4 months on our diets, then measured again, and whoever showed the most improvement would win.  I blew them out of the water.  The vegan's numbers actually got worse.  Even though I won, and collected $$$, I felt the worse, so I quit immediately after.  After 4 months I never got used to it. It was the toughest diet I've ever done.  The point is, only do a diet if you can sustain it.  You can give it a couple of months, but if you find you're not adapting, switch it up."

nutrition,379dkl,evange,6,Wed May 27 00:36:46 2015 UTC,I'll definitely say all diets work as long as you follow it. That's the ultimate diet is the diet you adhere too. Now both have short comings somewhere that the opposition can argue.... I believe in a middle ground of moderate-high protein depending on your love for meat and then you can see fruits and starches as optional additions. When it comes to veggies you can basically eat massive salads with a vinegerette and you really can't go overboard. B12 calcium iron folate magnesium are the most common for people to not get enough of. I base my diet around those and seem to eat an equal portion between all food categories
nutrition,379dkl,Hailbacchus,2,Tue May 26 00:27:30 2015 UTC,"All diets work a long as you stick to it! The same reason for weight loss on every diet is calorie deficit! But the problem with any diet is that as soon as you are off the diet, you are no longer on that calorie deficit, instead you are probably over eating, then you gain all the weight back and more.   Why not create a healthy life style change so you can have a lean and healthy body for the rest of your life? Don't discriminate any food and eat everything in moderation. As long as you have a calorie deficit, you will see weight loss and not have bad relationship with food. ( Check out my weight loss basic video on calorie, really explains on how you can lose weight and not be on a diet here  But just to answer your question about vegan vs paleo. Paleo is definitely healthier. Because when you are on vegan, you will be low on B12 and other key vitamins. Also you are more likely to have not enough complete protein issues. When you are on paleo diet, you won't really have any nutrient deficiency problem. So if you want to follow a diet between the two, I would go with paleo. Good luck :-)"

However, trying to eat out with omni friends, eating at events, family gatherings, or just stopping to grab food quick while you're out is insanely difficult. Your options are severely limited. So, I decided that being vegetarian was the most practical thing I could do. I refuse to eat meat, but I will eat eggs and dairy if it's really inconvenient not to. I won't buy milk, I buy organic/cage-free/free range eggs occasionally and now I've actually added seafood back into my diet.

You can go a high-fat route with lots of nuts, seeds, and oils, or you can go low-fat with primarily fruits, greens, and starches.   Veganism is not a diet, it's an ethics system. Granted, people become vegans for reasons other than ethics, but those vegans usually have their own set of dietary restrictions in addition to not eating meat, eggs, or dairy. For example, I'm a vegan for health reasons. I aim to eat primarily fruit, vegetables, root vegetables, wholegrains, and legumes, with 80% of calories from carbohydrates, 10% from fat, and 10% from protein. But I care less if there is a minuscule amount of animal product in a dish than I do if there is added fat. I'm 80-10-10 first, vegan second, (but 80-10-10 is impossible to follow without almost entirely cutting out animal products, so I am a de-facto vegan, even though I don't have particularly strong feelings about animal welfare)."

Rather, extremely high vegetable, and a lot of the green leafy and cruciferous vegetables that all experts agree most first world nations currently aren't eating nearly enough of. It's meant to be a varied diet you can eat long term, a lifestyle change as opposed to the flawed concept of a ""diet"" as temporarily restricted calories followed by taking up excessive calories again later, regaining weight.  Paleo is easier to maintain a healthier weight on simply because you can eat an enormous amount of low-calorie vegetation, filling one up with fiber, plus the satiating effects of fat and protein from meat, without a surge of insulin to lower blood sugar over much and cause more hunger later. In other words, it's just an easier way to maintain calories in / calories out without so much hunger. That's all. Easier. Not the only way. Vegetarianism/veganism can manage the same thing, but the starchy nature of most of their protein sources means they're more likely to put on weight while getting sufficient nutrition. Anecdotally, no one I know on paleo is fat, and have equal or better blood work than vegetarians I know, who quite often are carrying a little extra.   I suppose if your entire diet is based off bread, sugar, and frozen dinner / McDonald's type processed foods it can be difficult and seem like a restrictive diet, but I've never walked into the produce, meat, fish or eggs aisle and felt even vaguely restricted.

Your statement is purely conjecture.   The first study indicates that... [b]efore the supplement was consumed, the memory of vegetarians and meat-eaters was similar, irrespective of whether they were  about  to  consume  the  placebo or  the  creatine  supplement. Interestingly, ""...in those who were meat-eaters, the consumption of the creatine supplement was associated with poorer memory compared with baseline values."" Applying the same specious reasoning you use for the vegetarian population one may posit that creatine supplementation is actually deleterious. Yet, you somehow gloss over this aspect? But how come both populations had similar baseline levels of memory? Should be we posit that vegetarians are smarter? That there is something inherently augmentative towards intelligence in the vegetarian diet? This are all similar forms of specious reasoning that you are using in when developing your conclusion.   The second study does not even compare vegetarian to non-vegetarian populations.  The third study uses a sub-population with a proclivity for low muscle mass. It then studies resistance training induced changes based on diet (notably a lactoovovegetarian diet) in this population. I don't quite understand how this supports concept of a deficiency. Basically the study shows that meat eaters had better lean body mass hypertrophy following resistance, but the diets were not isocaloric The vegetarian population consumed less calories than the meat eating group. Likewise they were not matched for protein intake. From here to ""vegans are at a risk for serious deficiency in creatine"" is a tremendous leap one which is not supported by this study.

Oh, old studies are suddenly invalid? Guys, we are throwing out so many anti-meat studies!   Nutrition is such a rapidly changing field that research from 30+ years (unless a seminal study - which these are not) are unlikely to be of sufficient strength or worth.   The understanding of confounders in nutrition science has increased exponentially from that time. Likewise, dietary components (of all diets) have also changed since then.   You understand that a vegan diet from the 1980s is not the same as a vegan diet in the 1990s, 2000s or 2010s?   A seminal study would have been validated multiple times over. But in many cases, the studies you post have not.    For example your level of evidence to assert that vegans are at a risk for serious deficiency in taurine is based on 12 people that ate a vegan diet in 1988. Surely, if the risk for deficiency of this non-essential amino acid was that serious there would be more research than one paltry study of insignificant external validity?"

I am also interested in the conclusions of the guy who is running an n=1 experiment on a pescetarian ketogenic diet at the moment. Might turn out it is superior to good old Atkins-style keto.   All of the baggage that meat carries attributes to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other health related problems.    Baggage like hamburger buns and french fries with patties, toast with morning bacon and eggs, bread with butter, rice filler in sausages, bread filler in kebab meat, potatoes in a shashlik, macaroni with cheese, the list goes on. Oops, those are all carbohydrates!   Low carb is simply not better for weight loss and overall health, are you kidding me?   Very low carbohydrate diets are superior for weight loss, suppressing hunger, preservation of lean mass, rock steady glucose and insulin control, prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, adjunct treatment of type 1 diabetes, neuroprotection, cognition, energy levels for everyday activities and endurance exercise, treatment of PCOS and metabolic syndrome, and for normalization of blood lipid profile and cardiovascular disease risk parameters.  They also have some emerging evidence for the treatment of acne, anxiety, certain types of cancer, depression, Alzheimer's, and possibly more.  What more do you need?  Compare this with the lower incidence of diabetes, cancer, and undifferentiated weight loss in the case of high carb low fat diets. And I won't even mention their risks and associated difficulties, that would take another 40 citations or so.   Your body runs off of carbs for everything,   That would be ATP. Any of the macronutrients can be converted into ATP.   carbs are your life   Human cells contain plenty of fat and protein, and barely any carbohydrate. Most notably neurons and neurites are full of phospholipids.   Your body needs carbs to maintain proper function, building cells everyday, keeping yourself energized and feeling good, etc.   I am not aware of any such process that requires glucose, but my knowledge is limited in this area, there might be one. Nonetheless, you do not need dietary carbohydrates, because your body can produce all the glucose it needs from amino acids and triglycerides via gluconeogenesis, and substitute it with ketones where it is possible. You can never ever run out of necessary glucose and energy, unless you are starving.   High carbs don't attribute directly to muscle gain.   Yes they do, by providing energy for bigger pumps, and by replenishing muscle glycogen. They also have some role in muscle synthesis, but it is arguable whether they are necessary.   Have you read any books on general nutrition, veganism, or plant-based diets?    Yup. And I have been reading articles and studies on cognition, depression, diabetes, and nutrition for nearly two and a half years. They all point to the simple fact that high carb diets are a terrible idea, and low carb diets are the way to go."

American Dietetic Association  It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  Dietitians of Canada  A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  The United States Department of Agriculture  Vegetarian diets (see context) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.   The National Health and Medical Research Council  Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.  The Mayo Clinic  A well-planned vegetarian diet (see context) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women.

It isn't without consequences and risks for the stomach:   Competitive Speed Eating: Truth and Consequences  Based on our observations, the key to success in competitive speed eating is the ability to slowly train and adapt the stomach so that it can expand and dilate to a remarkable degree, enabling the speed eater to consume an extraordinary volume of food in an extremely short time (possibly superimposed on an innately compliant stomach).  In that sense, a top competitive speed eater may be compared with a predatory carnivore that periodically gorges itself on its kills, ingesting massive amounts of food for sustenance until it captures another prey days or even weeks later.  The trade-off is that the speed eater no longer experiences the sensation of fullness and satiety that normally occurs at the end of a meal. In effect, the speed eater's stomach becomes so compliant and distensible that he or she never feels sated.  When questioned on this subject, the competitive speed eater indicated unequivocally that his participation in the sport left him incapable of experiencing the usual sensation of fullness and satiety after meals  (...)  Even more worrisome is the potential risk that a chronically dilated, flaccid stomach may eventually decompensate, so that it becomes an enormous sac incapable of shrinking to its original size and incapable of peristalsing or emptying solid food. If this happens, long-term competitive speed eaters ultimately could develop intractable nausea and vomiting, necessitating a partial or total gastrectomy to relieve their symptoms and restore their ability to eat. Thus, speed eating is a potentially self-destructive form of behavior that over time could lead to morbid obesity, intractable nausea and vomiting, and even the need for gastric surgery  http://www.ajronline.org/doi/full/10.2214/AJR.07.2342   and more reading on :   Hereâs What Competitive Eating Does to Your Body  And while no one knows exactly how stretching their stomachs will affect competitive eaters years down the line, Levine and his team predicted some scary consequences.  If the stomach stretches enough that it canât get back to its original size, they predict this could potentially cause intractable nausea and vomiting, necessitating a partial or total gastrectomy to relieve their symptoms and restore their ability to eat  http://time.com/2954614/competitive-eating-health-risks/"

I sometimes exceed 40g a day. (I'm a woman)  It's actually really easy to reach your fibre goals for the day if you aim to eat a mostly whole food and unprocessed diet. Aim to eat your 5-10 servings of vegetables and fruits and chose whole grain when possible (brown rice, whole wheat bread). Eat no sugar added/whole grain breakfast cereals like Shredded Wheat or oatmeal instead of Corn Flakes or Fruit Loops. Eat beans occasionally. Fibre granola bars make for good occasional snacks."

Uh, unless you're eating lots of fat, meat, and highly refined, prepackaged foods, it's not difficult at all.   I routinely get 40-50 grams of fiber a day without even thinking about it. You just need to base your diet around fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, and legumes, and getting enough fiber will just ""happen"".   For one, its pretty rare for most foods to have more than 5 grams of fiber per serving, and most foods don't even have anywhere close to that much.    A single apple has 5g of fiber. If you eat lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, and legumes, 5g of fiber per serving starts to become common place.

Overfeeding fructose calories for example in the context of a hypercaloric diet with low protein tends to build a different body type than isocalorically overfeeding protein calories with a low intake of fructose.  Likewise, losing weight with a bunch of blood sugar spikes from refined carbohydrates and low-protein calories tends to produce a different body type and level of hunger than an isocaloric diet with a higher protein + fat intake without the spikes in blood sugar.  http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/do-calories-matter   What you eat actually changes how you expend energy.  Similarly, how you expend energy changes what (and how) you eat.  To be even more nuanced, what you eat further impacts what you subsequently eat.  As you increase (or decrease) in size, this impacts how you expend energy.  Energy density (calories) of food does matter, for sure, but what matters much more is what that food does in and to our bodies.  Will the calories we consume create an environment in our bodies where we want to consume more energy than we expend?  Will the calories we consume create an environment in which our bodies prefer to store excess nutrients as fat rather than mobilize fat?  These are the choices we make every time we put something in our mouth.  Our bodies are complex and dynamic systems with more feedback loops than even the most elaborate Tianhe-1A computer.  This means that two people can eat the exact same things and do the exact same amount of exercise and yet store different amounts of fat.  Does it mean they have violated the First Law of Thermodynamics?  Of course not.  Similarly, genetically identical twins can eat different macronutrient diets (i.e., differing amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrates) of the same number of calories, while doing a constant amount of exercise, and accumulate different amounts of fat.  Does this violate the First Law of Thermodynamics?  Nope.  What you eat (along with other factors, like your genetic makeup, of course) impacts how your body partitions and stores fat.  In case anyone is wondering how I got over 2,000 words into this post without mentioning the i-word, wonder no longer.  Insulin, while not the only factor involved in this process, is probably at the top of the list.  When you eat foods that have the double whammy of increasing insulin levels AND increasing your cellâs resistance to insulin, your body prioritizes fat storage over fat utilization.  Remember the great medical disconnect â no one disputes that insulin is the most singularly important hormone for causing fat cells to accumulate fat.  Somehow the dispute centers on what causes people (full of billions of fat cells) to accumulate fat.  All calories are not created equally:  The energy content of food (calories) matters, but it is less important than the metabolic effect of food on our body."

Bacteria in your gut can feed on it, but no energy exchange with the byproducts of that. So for me a 1500 calorie diet with no fiber was equivalent to a 2000 calorie diet high in fiber (those are my real numbers from my current experiment).  It adds up to more than just the amount of fiber calories because some of the other nutrients like sugars and proteins are bound to fiber and your body has a hard time extracting them, and end up passing undigested through your body.  Fiber also helps prevent insulin spikes so less ends up stored as fat, and utilized more transiently.  In the example you listed, nuts are high fiber so I agree with the author of that.  You can say that given any diet, eating sufficiently less of it will lead to weight loss. However, there are advantages to switching to different diets for weight loss and overall health."

He proposed, and I think rightly so, that the hormone is tied to your insulin levels. When your insulin increases, the 'fat hormone' increases, telling your body to store fat. Keeping your blood sugar either down or at healthy levels tells your body that the fat isn't needed. I started trying this method a while back and it is definantly working. I don't count calories, I just drink water, tea, or crystal light (I use a gallon of water instead of 2 quarts per packet), I consider that protien doesn't count as raising my blood sugar and I try to make about %40 of my diet come from animal fat (like the fat on steak) or fat from legumes and nuts (like pistachios).

First of all, it was Gary Taubes.  Second he proposed that insulin, already known to be the fat storage hormone, is important to regulate if you want to lose weight.   Keeping your blood sugar either down or at healthy levels tells your body that the fat isn't needed.   No.  It tells your body that glucose is in short supply and because we can't store nearly as much glucose as fat, we should probably start burning fat for energy.   I consider that protien doesn't count as raising my blood sugar   Yet it does raise insulin (more than carbs on a per gram basis), which is the very thing you're trying to limit  All that matters is calories in-out, but for some people, they have trouble managing hunger because they eat too many refined foods.  By limiting foods that drive hunger (it's a lot easier to eat 1 meal per day on a equicaloric high fat diet than a equicaloric high carb diet), your body can take control of it's cravings, so you eat when you're hungry and lose weight."

All I can usefully add is that also a calorie is not a calorie in terms of how full it will make you feel, which directly affects the difficulty of controlling hunger. Protein and fiber are bulk, they along with fat take time to digest or cannot be. Additionally, some fiber and resistant starches are digested by gut flora into short chain fatty acids, which are also quickly and easily burned, as well as possibly necessary for intestinal health.   What that means is a high protein/fiber diet is going to keep you full with consistent blood sugar levels, as compared to high insulin levels of a carbier diet which often overcorrect blood sugar levels to a hypoglycemic state, driving additional feelings of hunger, making it harder to control the calories taken in.   That on top of the multitude of ways ATP can be generated and proteins used in building muscle rather than necessarily being converted to fat."

nutrition,373pbg,FrigoCoder,1 point,Tue May 26 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"A few reasons why the simplistic calories in calories out (more properly calories in = used as energy or stored as fat) hypothesis is bullshit:   Middle chain triglycerides turn into ketones, which can not be stored, and are most likely excreted when the body is not adapted to burn ketones. During low carbohydrate dieting, gluconeogenesis waste some of the energy as heat. During ketogenic dieting you excrete excess ketones in breath, sweat, and urine. Not a significant waste, but still. During high carbohydrate low fat dieting, de novo lipogenesis waste 25% of the energy to store carbohydrates as fat. [1] Hormonal signaling, especially insulin still triumph caloric intake. That is why type 1 diabetics can lose tens of kilos during a bout of diabetic ketoacidosis. Thyroid diseases still impact weight, although not to the extent fat acceptance proponents claim.   My favorite summary of calories in calories out is by /u/ashsimmonds: [2]   Calories in, calories out bro! That's all that matters. Don't worry about a pesky little diagram getting in the way of an ideology. [3]   Complex metabolic and hormonal pathways won't adhere to simplistic hypotheses."

Vitamin E is what prevents fat from going rancid. My understanding is that vitamin E is a little bit more important than that article lets on. Based on what I've read, everything in your body is surrounded by a lipid membrane: all cells, all organelles, all organs, arteries, muscles, everything. The lipid membranes' integrity is effectively maintained by adequate levels of vitamin E, which help counter the effect of free radicals. However, any fat that you eat that isn't rancid already has vitamin E in it. So unless you eat zero fat or only indulge in rancid fat (not likely!), then you are likely just fine.    The note about increased omega-6 intake requiring higher doses of vitamin E is interesting though."

nutrition,375ice,knockout2281,2,Mon May 25 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"So the first thing I'll address is the weight loss. Generally as you lose weight you will require less and less energy to maintain your weight. So after losing 5lbs you may need to lower your intake by another 250cal if you want to continue losing weight. Literally, there is less mass and tissue for your body to maintain so it doesn't need as much energy. Eventually this gets to a point of diminishing returns as you may not be eating enough to be happy/sane or you are looking more skinny but not defined. This is where building muscle and working out usually comes in.   For the workouts the best advice I can give without getting too into the weeds is to set some goals and make a plan to achieve them. Unless your 30min of ""weights"" is super intense I'd bet money you're not burning nearly as many calories than you think in the gym or even really making any progress. You should strive to push your body to stimulate change and improve.   But yeah track what you're eating for a bit to see the actual caloric and macronutrient overview of what you're putting in your body. I've known people who think they eat healthy and after alooking at a food diary discover all they were eating were carbs, and then their one desert at the end of the day had enough fat to put them in a calorie surplus - ergo no weight loss."

No, they are very different.     Generally speaking, the weaker or more degraded the cell walls in the plant material we eat, the more calories we get from it. Cooking easily ruptures cells in, say, spinach and zucchini, but cassava (Manihot esculenta) or Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) is much more resistant. When cell walls hold strong, foods hoard their precious calories and pass through our body intact (think corn).  Studies suggest that peanuts, pistachios and almonds are less completely digested than other foods with similar levels of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, meaning they relinquish fewer calories than one would expect. A new study by Janet A. Novotny and her colleagues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that when people eat almonds, they receive just 129 calories per serving rather than the 170 calories reported on the label. They reached this conclusion by asking people to follow the same exact dietsâexcept for the amount of almonds they ateâand measuring the unused calories in their feces and urine.   http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-reveals-why-calorie-counts-are-all-wrong/  Still that's totally different than the thermic effect of food."

That said, all the increased growth signalling also seems to increase adult colorectal cancer and advanced prostate cancer risk. The most interesting study (with least confounding) arrived just a few months ago, and found that 22,000 lactose-intolerant individuals, who very likely avoided most dairy after infancy, had 45%, 21%, and 39% lower incidence of lung, breast, and ovarian cancers, respectively, whereas their lactose-tolerant siblings and parents had the same risks as the general population.  It creates a conundrum for parents, as height is strongly associated with income, particularly in males.

Someone who is absorbing it quite well is likely to be fine below the recommended daily value.

Saturated Fatty Acids and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease: Modulation by Replacement Nutrients   ""Studies in animals and humans support the concept that replacement of saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats results in improved lipid profiles, specifically, decreased TC and LDL cholesterol with minimal decreases in HDL cholesterol, as well as with decreased CVD risk.""   Effects on Coronary Heart Disease of Increasing Polyunsaturated Fat in Place of Saturated Fat: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials   ""These findings provide evidence that consuming PUFA in place of SFA reduces CHD events in RCTs. This suggests that rather than trying to lower PUFA consumption, a shift toward greater population PUFA consumption in place of SFA would significantly reduce rates of CHD.""   Major types of dietary fat and risk of coronary heart disease: a pooled analysis of 11 cohort studies.   ""The associations suggest that replacing SFAs with PUFAs rather than MUFAs or carbohydrates prevents CHD over a wide range of intakes.""   Support for or against fat being good/bad for you   Fat is essential. It's not whether it's good or bad for you, it's which fats are healthier than others. Trans fat and saturated fats are the ones you should minimize. Plant-based fats, like from nuts, seeds, and avocados, are a good source of fat because they also come with other benefits. Nuts and seeds have sterols and stanols (which help lower LDL cholesterol) and lignans, which might have health benefits.    Dietary lignan intakes in relation to survival among women with breast cancer: the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) Study   Because of the healthy benefits of plant-based fats, I personally would not follow the 10% rule for those. Also, eating salads with fats (like seeds and nuts) has been shown to increase the bioavailability of carotenoids (green leafy vegetables and others).   Carotenoid bioavailability is higher from salads ingested with full-fat than with fat-reduced salad dressings as measured with electrochemical detection"

The question is whether saturated fats are inherently bad for you, not whether there are better nutrients. I would live off a mixture of MCTs, EPA, oleic acid, and nervonic acid, if it was feasible. Rely on intermediary biomarkers such as LDL count. I am much more interested in actual health effects, not inferred associations built on assumptions of the lipid hypothesis. Starting from the assumption that LDL is bad because saturated fat raises it and it is bad, then concluding saturated fat is bad because it raises LDL, is some kind of strange logic.

Nearly all clinical trials in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s compared usual diets with those characterized by low total fat, low saturated fat, low dietary cholesterol, and increased polyunsaturated fats. Free-living volunteers were able to adhere to these diets whose goal was to decrease serum cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular events. These diets did reduce cholesterol levels. However, they did not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease deaths.  Conclusions: The last 50 years of epidemiology and clinical trials have established a clear link among diet, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events. Nutritional interventions have proven that a âwhole dietâ approach with equal attention to what is consumed and what is excluded is more effective in preventing cardiovascular disease than low-fat, low-cholesterol diets.   Comparing a higher fat diet vs a lower fat diet:   The Mediterranean-style diet, with a focus on vegetables, fruit, fish, whole grains, and olive oil, has proven to reduce cardiovascular events to a degree greater than low-fat diets and equal to or greater than the benefit observed in statin trials.   The Mediterranean diet from this article was over 40% fat, which would make fat the largest macronutrient where the bulk of energy would be generated.  http://graemethomasonline.com/carbohydrate-daily-requirements/   During low intensity activity, almost all your energy needs are met through burning fat.  Reality check: what percentage of your day is spent performing low-intensity activity? You know the stuff Iâm referring to: sitting at a desk, sleeping, driving your car, eatingâ¦ you get the idea.  Would it be a fair assumption on my part to say you probably spend most, if not all, of your 24 hours each day in low-intensity activity.

Ignore the creative writeup and look for the sections Problems with high carb low fat diets, Debunking the lipid hypothesis, Collections of studies on low carb diets, and Studies on low carb diets.  My conclusion is that neither of saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fats are problematic within the context of a low carb diet.  However this changes when coupled with high carbohydrate intake: Saturated fats exacerbate the hyperglycemia and lipotoxicity caused by high carbohydrate intake, whereas omega 6 polyunsaturated fats exacerbate the inflammatory response initiated by them.  This is the real source of the discrepancy in studies investigating meat and fat consumption: They never ever control against carbohydrate intake.  Yet meat is almost always consumed with carbohydrates: Hamburger buns and french fries with patties, toast with morning bacon and eggs, bread with butter, rice filler in sausages, bread filler in kebab meat, potatoes in a shashlik, macaroni with cheese, the list goes on. Kind of a major confounding factor, don't you think?  High carb low fat diets, especially 80-10-10 and 90-5-5 clown diets, do not have much evidence behind them, apart from questionable studies done by biased vegan researchers like Ornish, Campbell, McDougall, and Esselstyn. They might be slightly better than high carb high fat diets like the standard american diet, but that is akin to comparing countries to North Korea.  They definitely have issues on their own: Nutrient deficiencies, gallstones, loss of lean mass, cognitive problems, depression, high AGE levels, hormonal changes, failure to thrive, bad lipid profile, impaired glucose utilization, constant hunger, hypoglycemic roller-coaster, et cetera.  There are numerous reasons why the ketogenic diet, Atkins, and other low carb diets outperform low fat diets in almost all aspects.  It is funny people still stick to the lipid hypothesis after even the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (ex American Dietetic Association), sponsored by food companies such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Unilever, was forced to admit that saturated fat has nothing to do with heart disease. Low carb diets and omega 3 fatty acids are outright protective of health.  tl;dr: Saturated fat is fine on low carb diets.

Increased 20:4n-6 and the ratios of 20:4n-6/20:5n-3 and n-6/n-3 are commonly viewed as pro-inflammatory, but unexpectedly were consistently inversely associated with responses in inflammatory proteins. In summary, a very low carbohydrate diet resulted in profound alterations in fatty acid composition and reduced inflammation compared to a low fat diet."" [1]   Saturated fats are less problematic within the context of low carb diets:   ""Limited Effect of Dietary Saturated Fat on Plasma Saturated Fat in the Context of a Low Carbohydrate Diet"" [2]  ""They clearly confirm that carbohydrate restriction leads to an improvement in atherogenic lipid states in the absence of weight loss or in the presence of higher saturated fat. In distinction, low fat diets seem to require weight loss for effective improvement in atherogenic dyslipidemia."" [3]  ""The results show that dietary and plasma saturated fat are not related, and that increasing dietary carbohydrate across a range of intakes promotes incremental increases in plasma palmitoleic acid, a biomarker consistently associated with adverse health outcomes"" [4]      You still might want to be wary.   Differential Metabolic Effects of Saturated Versus Polyunsaturated Fats in Ketogenic Diets  ""Consistent with these data, we found that a SAT KD, despite being less ketogenic than a POLY KD, induced unfavorable changes in circulating lipids and lipoproteins and did not improve SI [insulin sensitivity]. This implies that a POLY KD may be preferable for chronic administration.""   The diet contained 15% carbohydrates, or 75g assuming 2000 kcal. I do not think 75g carbs is the most appropriate for a ketogenic diet. The standard recommendation is to keep it below 20g for several weeks before even thinking about doing tricks with carbohydrate intake. Why are they reporting it as a percentage of calories, without disclosing the calorie intake? Absolute values of carbohydrate intake matters more for ketogenic purposes than percentages.  Study duration was only 5 days. Full keto-adaptation can take up to 2-3 months. It is entirely plausible that adaptation to burn saturated fat requires longer time than for polyunsaturated, due to different metabolic pathways that have to be upregulated. During starvation you mainly burn saturated and monounsaturated fats, and it also takes several weeks to maximize beta-hydroxybutyrate production. MCTs definitely win in this regard since they instantly turn into ketones, and they are saturated.  And I do not see why would you need increased insulin sensitivity when your goal is to burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. Ketogenic diets are often bashed because they cause physiological insulin resistance, which we like to call adaptive glucose sparing. That's just cells sparing glucose in the presence of ketones. Hmmm... Maybe they measured higher serum ketone levels not because ketogenesis was higher, but because cells took up less ketones and more glucose? Lower serum glucose is consistent with this. They should have measured the level of gluconeogenesis somehow, perhaps via nitrogen balance or lean mass changes?  Even if we can take the results of the study at face value, it is still prudent to set limits on polyunsaturated fatty acids. Excess omega 3 fatty acids increase risk of bleeding, which prevents their use as a true macronutrient. Omega 6:3 ratio might still be important despite the limited effect of omega 6 fatty acids on inflammatory markers within the context of ketogenic diets. We definitely need more research on this.  And if our primary goal is to increase ketone production, MCT oil supplementation is still preferred over polyunsaturated fatty acids."

I couldn't get the fourth link to work.   There have been studies done that show that industry sponsored research tends to favor industry favorable results.

They knew where to stab though, its results were consistent with another, hopefully independent study, thus I felt comfortable to include it in my list of studies. However I neglected to bookmark that study and can no longer find it. I could ask /r/ketoscience if they have seen it.  I was not aware of the funding issues of the other studies, thanks for the heads-up.  I highly dislike food industry (and pharma) sponsorship of research. Be it the grain industry, junk food companies, or the beef industry. Even if they do not directly influence individual studies, they still distort the overall scientific consensus. The negative effects of such influences are clear as day when looking at the food industry and pharma sponsors of dietitian and diabetic associations, and the diets they recommend to type 2 diabetics. And let's not forget the recent scandal where it turned out the sugar industry infiltrated the dental division of the NIH to shift focus away from sugar as the main cause of tooth decay.  I am not particularly worried about the Atkins Foundation. I do not expect other organizations to fund research into ketogenic diets. Veg*an and dietitian organizations sure as hell won't. I do not see any incentive for state funding either. Would be nice though.  And as for the particular claims that omega 6 and saturated fat has less negative effects within the context of low carb and ketogenic diets, I do not see what they would gain by forging such easily refutable claims. Low carb and especially ketogenic dieters are still a niche market, already eat more meat, eggs, and dairy than other groups, not worth targeting, and the average person on high carb diets is still going to shy away from excess omega 6 and saturated fat even if they have knowledge of these studies.  I do not have other corroborating research for the first three studies at hand.  For the omega 6 claim, I believe there might be studies on epileptic kids given omega 6 rich formulations, but you can already see the problem: They are using industrial sludge formulations instead of whole foods.  For the saturated fat claim, you could just reconcile the results of existing studies that show how (serum) saturated fats exacerbate hyperglycemia and lipotoxicity, with the complete lack of such issues in the hundreds of studies investigating low carb diets."
nutrition,36ul48,InsertHomeEnd,34,Fri May 22 06:34:32 2015 UTC,"First off, if you have blood in your stool regularly that isn't clearly explained by, say, a small cut/incision near your anus, you need to see a doctor to find out the actual cause. Fiber might help, but it could also be something serious and you should find out for sure if this is regular enough that you're posting about it! That said:  1) Dietary fiber is fiber that naturally occurs in food, so yes the fiber in apples is dietary fiber. This separates it from something called ""functional fiber"" which is added to foods later on or food manufactured to have more fiber than it normally would. Both of them are fiber and both will have a positive impact. It's just the source of the fiber that is different. So in the case of fruit juice, if it's actual juice (fairly clear when you look through it) then it has no fiber, but if you put full food into a food processor and don't discard the ""pulp"" and other mushy bits but drink all of the product then you are still getting the fiber.  2) There are two other designations of fiber: Soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber turns into a sort of ""gel"" when mixed with water. This is why fiber can help you feel more full. Insoluble fiber doesn't absorb the water/become gel-like but instead move through your GI tract mostly in-tact, adding bulk to stool which speeds the movement of waste through your gut. Because soluble fiber absorbs water to make a gel and because insoluble fiber causes you to defecate (which will result in some water loss) it's important to stay hydrated. Hydration itself also helps with regular bowel activity, which is frequently a desire of people who are upping their fiber intake.  3) There is slight concern that too much fiber may limit absorption of nutrients because of the rate of transit. However, the major concern with too much fiber is uncomfortable bowel movements. (Going too often, diarrhea, painful BM, bloating, excessive gas, etc.) I for one eat ~45g-55g of fiber per day, nearly twice my recommended amount, and have no negative consequences. Just increase fiber slowly to the point you would like it to be at and be sure you don't go overboard for you."
nutrition,36ul48,AtomikRadio,5,Fri May 22 08:02:36 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add why fiber is important for everyone.   1)  Mechanical Benefits:  Fiber likes to be at a gel like consistency.   It's the same consistency that is comfortable for pooping.   When you take daily fiber,  your body isn't having painful hard stools or excessively watery stools.   2)  Inhibiting Infectious Organisms:  This gel like consistency rolls up all of your food as you're digesting it and passes it through your digestive tract.   When an infectious organism invades your digestive tract,  it likes to latch on top three walls of the colon and grow and multiply.   Fiber prevents this by locking it in this gel and passing it out.   So if you are something just a little sketchy,  fiber would decrease the likelihood of of it attaching and forming a stronghold.   (However,  fiber is NOT recommended for an infection that is already established.   At that point,  you need to flush it out)   3)  Fiber Prevents Heart Attacks:  When you eat fiber,  along with the other stuff that's mixed into this gel,  you also mix in bile a substance that aids in the digestion of lipids.   This absorbed bile is then excreted into the feces.    To make up for this loss,  the liver synthesizes more bile salts and uses cholesterol.  It then upregulates LDL  receptors that pull cholesterol from the blood (LDL is a molecule that holds cholesterol but kinda sucks at it.   It drops the cholesterol all over the inner lining of your blood vessels and creates atherosclerotic plaques.   As an aside,  dogs and cats have cholesterol carriers that are far superior to humans and don't die of heart disease at the rate that humans do.)  This decreases your chance at coronary artery disease.   4)  Fiber Prevents Cancer:   Besides the skin cancers,  colon cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in the United States and the 3rd most deadliest.   Through the same mechanism of creating this gel like poop,  fiber traps many substances in the middle of the lumen (passagway) of your intestine.   Some of these substances may be carcinogenic.   By limiting the amount of time that these substances interact with the wall of your lumen,  you decrease the chances of establishing a mutagenic change which could lead to cancer.   5)  Fiber Can Help With Anxiety Related Diarrhea:  With the same mechanism I stated above,  fiber likes to be a gel.   When you are stressed about a big exam,  your body goes into sympathetic overdrive and focuses your resources on your aggressor and diverts resources away from your digestive tract.   The result is a diarrhea which really isn't helping your situation anyways.   Fiber mechanically makes your stools a gel so you don't have to factor in constantly racing to the bathroom while your taking a big test.   TLDR: Fiber is great!   Prevents constipation,  diarrhea,  heart disease and colon cancer!   Edit: This is more for soluble fiber.   Insoluble fiber seems to have a little more laxitive effect."

For the fiber to be protective, it needs to come from whole foods.  Studies looking into the effects of fiber supplementation haven't been so successful.  It's likely that this is just a correlational effect (fiber is good for you because veggies are good for you) rather than it actually being due to the fiber.   TLDR: Fiber is great! Prevents constipation, diarrhea,    Except in people with IBS or specific types of fiber that are known to have constipating (banannas, guavas) or encourage the passing of stool (e.g. prunes).

I'm sure there are vegans that do get heart disease.  What I was referring to were these points in these articles from The Journal of the American Medical Association:    Our results suggest an inverse association between fiber intake and Ml. These results support current national dietary guidelines to increase dietary fiber intake and suggest that fiber, independent of fat intake, is an important dietary component for the prevention of coronary disease.   But I would also like to add that this process is a lot more complicated than just the effects on LDL.  This article sums some stuff up.   High intake of dietary fiber, especially soluble fiber, decreases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and has little or no effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.21,22 However, the effect of soluble fiber on serum cholesterol level is modest and could not account for a substantial reduction in CHD incidence. Diets high in dietary fiber also may have other beneficial physiological effects, such as increased insulin sensitivity, lower triglyceride levels, and favorable effects on plasminogen activator type 1 and factor VII activity.23- 33   -Yes, fiber from whole grains is great!   -If you have a medical condition where fiber is contraindicated, then don't eat it.

You do not digest the fiber.  Bacteria do (at least some of the soluble fiber).  These bacteria need to be in balance (e.g. not too much of one, not too little of another) and are supposed to be diverse.  In people with gut issues (and various neurological problems), the immune system kills off certain species and screws up the balance.  Fewer species dominate and don't play as well together.  It's similar to an ecosystem.  By removing the predators, the herbioves start having a boom-bust cycle.  Anyways, the end result of bacterial digestion is various vitamins, minerals, short chain saturated fatty acids (e.g. butyrate and propinate) and various immune system modulating compounds.  Also, a low FODMAP diet isn't necessarily a low gas or low fiber or low vegetable diet.  Different people with IBS respond differently to different compounds (e.g. oligosaccarides, fructans), so it's about finding out what works for you.  In other words, gas isn't the same thing as bloating or diarrhea/constipation.   But I would also like to add that this process is a lot more complicated than just the effects on LDL.    It's a whole lot more complicated.  Cholesterol isn't even bad.  High oxidized cholesterol is bad.  Low cholesterol is a proxy for low oxidized cholesterol, but low cholesterol isn't the same thing as low oxidized cholesterol.  There are vegan that have had heart attacks a with total chesterol of 140 mg/dL.  The AHA ""optimal"" value is <150 mg/dL.  Saturated fat raises LDL, but overwhelmingly raises LDL Pattern A.  Dietary carbohydrates lower LDL, but raise LDL Pattern B (sugar especially).  If you take two people with the same LDL, but one has primarily LDL-A, vs. LDL-B, the person with LDL-B will be at greater risk for heart disease.  They will also have higher triglycerides (fat in the blood) and lower HDL, two major risk factors for heart disease and diabetes (which further raises your risk for heart disease).  In terms of dietary cholesterol, the latest nutritional guidelines (previously set at 300 mg/day; about one egg) have been entirely removed though the final recommendations (they get reviewed) will come out in 4 months or so."
nutrition,36ul48,billsil,2,Sat May 23 22:12:31 2015 UTC,Very comprehensive and helpful.  In my uneducated knowledge also highly accurate.
nutrition,36ul48,CaptainGulliver,2,Fri May 22 08:28:57 2015 UTC,"This is all correct as far as I'm aware. Adding to a couple of points though:  1) Specifically, fibre is typically accepted as being the walls of cells. There's a bit more to it than that, but cell walls cannot be broken down through digestion by any known mammal, as the enzymes required are not present.  3) If you regularly get too much fibre then yes you can limit the amount of nutrients that you absorb, but the main concern is the long term effect of regular diarrhoea; it can cause your bowel to go loose, and once that happens it is hard to undo. One way of telling that you're getting too much fibre is that your stool goes yellow/greenish. This happens when food is passed through your intestines too quickly, and the colour is given by bile. Bile starts out green, and then as it does its job it turns to yellow then to brown."
nutrition,36ul48,modernbenoni,1 point,Fri May 22 08:45:29 2015 UTC,I thought most sources believed the yellow from excess bile in stool was due to excess fat. Is this not so?

It could be harmless hemorrhoids, which can definitely be helped by fiber, but you could have polyps or a GI bleed. Need to get that checked out.   Dietary fiber is found naturally in foods. It doesn't cancel out sugar, it just makes your body digest the sugar more slowly, making you less susceptible to things like type 2 diabetes. Imagine fiber being like a chain link fence around the little sugar molecules; when you eat an apple your body has to take bolt cutters to the fence and let the sugar escape one molecule at a time. If you eat a candy bar it's like just opening a gate, all the sugar can get out at once."

Sometimes you just need to change up what you eat for a while, let things calm down, and you'll be fine eating whatever you want after a week or so.   2) You need to drink more water when you increase dietary fiber intake, why's that?   Because fiber sucks up water and you will become so constipated if you don't, which of course causes hemmroids.   3) Is too much fiber bad?

I usually eat one of these options per meal per day depending on my schedule:  Breakfast-- 1) 1 cup of bran flakes with 1 cup of 1% milk (~250 calories). 2) PB, oatmeal, banana, spinach/kale, flax smoothie (~500 calories). 3) Boca burger w/1 egg and a piece of dry toast (~350 calories). 4) 2 eggs and 2 pieces of toast (~400 calories)  Lunch-- 1) PB&J sandwich (~500 calories), 2) Ramen (~400 calories), 3) A combination of cooked and raw vegetables and tofu (~100-350 calories depending on that day's ratio), 4) 5.3 oz Greek yogurt w/ 1 cup of bran flakes (~250 calories).  Dinner-- 1) Eggplant burger w/onion bun, onions, spinach, no cheese w/a cooked vegetable (~400 calories), 2) 2-4 oz pasta with stir fried vegetables (less than 1 TBSP coconut or olive oil for the entire pan, which yields 4-6 servings) (~300-500 calories depending on what vegetables are used). 3) Homemade vegetarian chili made from beans, tomatoes, soy crumbles, jalapenos, onions, garlic, green peppers (~100 calories a cup--I took every single ingredient once, totaled it all up, then portioned out the entire pot to determine how many servings--it's just about 100 calories per cup). 4) Some combination of tofu and vegetables--baked, stir fried, etc, served with 1 cup of cooked brown rice (425-525 calories, depending on the cooking style--aka whether coconut oil was involved or not).

nutrition,36v6jl,FrigoCoder,3,Fri May 22 23:04:03 2015 UTC,"Is that total carbohydrates or net carbohydrates (carbs minus fiber and sugar alcohols)? If total, that would mean 140-150g of net carbs a day, which might be okay, if net, it is too much. I would keep net carbs below 120g a day.  Protein is 1.06 g/kg, which is a bit low for my liking. Try to push it up to 1.4 g/kg, for example by a single 30g serving of whey protein after exercise. Maximal muscle synthesis rates are achieved at 0.8 g/kg for sedentary people, 1.4 g/kg for endurance athletes, 1.8 g/kg for strength athletes. However, 1.4 g/kg is still appropriate for strength exercise.  What do you exercise? Try to do both lifting and cardio. I recommend Stronglifts 5x5 and Couch to 5k if you are inexperienced in one or the other. I had best weight loss results with daily cardio, jogging and cycling on alternate days. Others warn against daily exercise however. Try to experiment which is best for you.  Might not be intuitive, but fat is better for fat loss than carbohydrates. Keep your carbohydrates below a chosen limit, meet your protein target, and fill the rest of your calories from fat. Avocados, olive oil, coconut oil, eggs, butter are excellent sources of fat. Fish too, if you can eat them. Other subreddits like /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo contain more advice on veg*an sources of fat.  Ditch grains (and potatoes) with the possible exception of oatmeal. No toasts, buns, or pasta. Substitute them with root vegetables and nutrient-rich fruits like berries. Avoid skim dairy, go for full fat one. Avoid snacking if possible.  Try to segregate your fat and carbohydrate intake. Go for fatty breakfasts, and carby suppers. Protein is always okay. Consume carbs and protein after endurance exercise, or before and after strength exercise. Do cardio while fasted. Use caffeine, carnitine, and possibly choline supplements for energy instead of food, assuming you do not have issues with anxiety, hypothyroidism, or depression.  Use an online diet planner such as EatThisMuch to check whether your actual diet corresponds to your goals."

I wouldn't typically recommend eating back more than 25-50% of calories burned in exercise, and I personally don't eat back any. At your stats and 1500 calories, you're poised to lose about 1lb per week, which is fantastic.

Barring a medical issue, I would go to a certified dietician who can better assess your personal nutritional issues.  That said, I'm not a fan of counting calories or weighing food.  Websites that calculate your calorie needs are just estimates.  Your personal numbers can be lower than that.  Don't be afraid to reduce what you eat further.  Check your weight every two weeks.  If you didn't lose at least 1 or 2 pounds in the 2 week period, decrease how much you eat in the following 2 week period.  Losing 4 pounds in a two week period would be ideal.  The trick is keeping your meals to a fixed pre planned set of choices for the two week periods.  That way you reduce from a known quantity and you don't inadvertently start eating something more dense. What the pre planned meals are is up to you but make it things you can easily reduce (a TV dinner is not easy to reduce, but the amount of rice, fruits, and vegetables you serve yourself are).  If you have to go down to an unhealthy number of calories to lose any weight (under 1000), go to a doctor and get checked out.  In terms of losing weight, macro composition doesn't matter as much in terms of creating an energy deficit, but it does matter in terms of being healthy.  60% of your calories are coming from carbs which is not that great.  Also in terms of health I'd cut all added sugars (I.e. Sugars in raw fruits and vegetables are fine).  No Sodas, juices, jams, jellies, etc (even if they say no added sugars).  Exercise helps in terms of health, but it can also make you hungrier, and if you're eating at a deficit it can make you feel fatigued and weak.  It can lead you to quit.  I would not overdo it.  For most people I've seen, 3 days of interval training per week has been enough.  Good luck and hope you report back with results."

If you're lactose intolerant whey protein powder is still fine.  If it's causing you problems you may in fact have a protein allergy.  Eat more eggs in the morning.  Perhaps 1-2 whole eggs and 4+ servings of egg whites.  Nuts are a good source of protein.  Quinoa is an excellent source of whole protein next to eggs.    Other options are beef derived protein powders.  I know you said you don't eat red meat but they do make protein powder derived from beef.  I heard it doesn't taste that great though.  Begals while having around 50g of carbs also have 10g of protein.  Protein bars.  My favorite option next to eggs is lactose free protein enriched milk.  I've only seen it here in Texas so far at HEB but i know it's slowly hitting the mass market.  Where normal lactose free milk tastes sweet and has around 12-16g of carbs and 6g of protein, this protein enriched milk has 12g of protein and 6g of carbs.  It tastes like regular milk as well, not sweet like regular lactose free milk."

Now, too low sodium can be problematic.  Too high, well, what is too high?  We have a measurable base for the low end, what do you deem an appropriate intake?

You can't because those foods, even though high in carbs, do not lead to diabetes. A 'high carb' diet means many different things, and you cannot make a blanket statement saying that all carbs lead to diabetes. It's simply not true."

nutrition,36qhaj,Insamity,3,Thu May 21 22:08:32 2015 UTC,"As far as your blood glucose is concerned, it is.   Pretty sure this is not the case. Added sugars are typically simple sugars, which, when consumed, cause an insulin spike due to the abundance of glucose suddenly entering the bloodstream. Starch, however, is a complex carb, and the glucose is released into the bloodstream at a slower rate. You don't get a sharp insulin spike from eating complex carbs, like you would from eating simple carbs."
nutrition,36qhaj,through_a_ways,4,Thu May 21 22:23:26 2015 UTC,Actually insulin spikes are a normal and healthy response to eating. Type 2 diabetes is actually characterized by the bodies inability to spike insulin as needed.
nutrition,36qhaj,alan_s,1 point,Thu May 21 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"I've never understood this:  are insulin spikes somehow worse than slow and long-duration doses of insulin?    Additionally, added sugars are only 50% insulin-stimulating glucose, while roots and grains are 100% glucose.  From that perspective, it makes much more sense to eat fruits than to eat roots and grains (and sugar should theoretically be about as bad for you as potatoes, since the former has the benefit of lower glucose, and the latter has the benefit of fiber)."
nutrition,36qhaj,Insamity,-4,Fri May 22 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure? Compare that with my dead certainty.  Why the talk of insulin spikes? Type 2 diabetics have both insulin spikes - which cause low blood glucose - and blood glucose spikes. If the two occur together and balance, excellent. But they don't.   Most type 2s never get an insulin spike sufficient to cause hypoglycemia symptoms, but when we do (I did) they are most often reactive excessive insulin following excessive post-meal blood glucose. You won't find that in many dietetics texts - if any - but you will find it discussed regularly on diabetes forums where we live with the condition.   Diabetes complications are not caused by insulin spikes. They are caused by excessive blood glucose spikes and levels.  Insulin spikes are not my problem. Blood glucose spikes are. I know what causes most of mine: excessive intake of carbohydrates at the wrong time.  I have NEVER had a blood glucose spike from a non-carb meal of fat and protein."

This sounds like some might just have reactive hypoglycemia in addition to type 2 diabetes.   Diabetes complications are not caused by insulin spikes. They are caused by excessive blood glucose spikes and levels.   Yeah but fruits and other high fiber carbs actually increase insulin sensitivity and help stabilize blood glucose.  Also I think there is a little miscommunication here. You are talking about managing diabetes while op is talking about preventing diabetes. These can require entirely different actions."

Asians have a greater tendency toward glucose metabolism, while Europeans (maybe Caucasians in general) have a greater tendency toward fat metabolism.    Of course, racial differences are just averages of the individual differences within those races.    I'm not sure whether the metabolic differences are trivial (as in the case of lactose tolerance, which is found in all ethnicities, but is simply more prevalent in some) or definitional (as in the case of racial traits like epicanthal folds, pigmentation, etc., where the trait almost defines the race, or vice versa).

nutrition,36qhaj,lifeandall,12,Fri May 22 08:26:29 2015 UTC,"Registered dietitian here. I just want to clarify that not all dietitians share the same views as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. I disagree with their position on many things and in general do not think they are a highly reputable organization. Unless a dietitian is a spokesperson for the Academy, he or she is in no way obligated to preach their views. But I will say that when I got my degree less than 10 years ago, we were taught that total dietary fat is not detrimental to health (to a degree), but that too much added sugar clearly is. I donât personally know any dietitians that were taught otherwise.    As for sodium, Americans are consuming too much (3,400mg/day on average). Virtually all reputable health organizations agree that sodium consumption should be reduced to a minimum of 2,300mg per day, and some (like the American Heart Association) suggest lowering to 1,500mg per day. This is especially true for those who have high blood pressure or are at risk for high blood pressure (those over the age of 65, African Americans, diabetics, etc.). I realize that not everyone will do detriment to their health if they consume more than that, but when creating guidelines for a population as a whole, you must err on the side of caution.  A mandatory retraining of all dietitians, as you suggest, is completely ridiculous, and quite honestly, insulting. Dietitians are required to complete a high number continuing education activities to maintain their RD licensure, which keeps them up to date on changes in nutritional science and recommendations. I think the real problem lies in the spread of misleading or incorrect nutrition information through the media and certain TV personalities. I want to scream whenever someone tries to tell me that saturated fat is now good for you or that gluten is the root of all of our health problems. Dietitians may not be perfect, but in general you are much more likely to get accurate information from a dietitian than you are from a variety of other sources (TV, many popular books, some doctors, etc.)."

However, it is basic training. I personally would not feel comfortable treating patients with diabetes, as it is not an area I have a lot of experience in. Other dietitians are brilliant in this area, with many going on to become Certified Diabetes Educators.

In fact if you look lower on that same page it recommends limiting carbohydrate intake multiple times   Carbohydrate amount and available insulin may be the most important factors influencing glycemic response after eating and should be considered when developing the eating plan.  Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains critical in achieving glycemic control.  Carbohydrate intake from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and dairy products should be advised over intake from other carbohydrate sources, especially those that contain added fats, sugars, or sodium.  Substituting low glycemic load foods for higher glycemic load foods may modestly improve glycemic control.   What they are giving here is a very detailed plan with dietary recommendations.

nutrition,36qhaj,FrigoCoder,2,Thu May 21 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"I'm all for updating current knowledge. Nutrition is plagued by myths and spin-doctors and proper trials in man are very difficult/expensive to carry out.  One of the interesting things that is gaining traction is insulin indices, replacing the glycaemic index which is basically useless. Have a look at this paper http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/66/5/1264.full.pdf.  One of the interesting things is that beef causes a greater increase in insulin than muesli, oats, or even pasta."

You guys just don't get it, and never will, until you live with diabetes.   It's midnight here so I'll read your paper in the morning. However, note that I often eat steak or hamburger or sausages or bacon and eggs for breakfast because the post breakfast blood glucose results are in the non-diabetic range while providing all the energy I need for my morning.

Nowhere in the links you cited do dieticians admit that added sugar is ""really, really bad."" Sure, Americans consume too much added sugar. The average American drinks dozens of gallons of soda per year.   Fat isn't bad. Saturated fat isn't bad. If you disagree, read up on the history of these nutrients in the human diet.   Carbs aren't bad. Sugar isn't bad. If you disagree, read up on the history of these nutrients in the human diet. People have been using, selling, making, baking with, eating added sugar for centuries and centuries.   If you eat potato chips, day in and day out, you will get fat. And then you will get sick. Not because of the fucking potatoes. The Irish relied heavily on potatoes until that crop suffered (hence the potato famine). You'll get sick and fat and probably have a heart attack because you're eating a processed, fatty, salty food that strikes many of the brain's pleasure centers and causes you to overeat. Yes, sugary foods can do that too. But the problem isn't sugar in and of itself. The problem is the foods sugar can be found in and how those foods cause people to crave the rush, overeat, eat an unbalanced diet, and get fat and sick.   It's the foods it's found in that are the problem, not the sugar in and of itself. A person can eat a peanut butter and jelly-with-added-sugar sandwich for a meal every day and be perfectly fine, even a picture of health. That is not a food that leads to overconsumption.   With the introduction of diet soda, most foods that Americans are getting sick from are high in both fat and sugar. The combination is deadly.  With low-fat processed foods, much of the time, the fat is replaced with added sugar. That's not a problem because ""sugar is evil while fat is fine,"" that's a problem because it lights up the brain reward circuits in just the same amounts. Fatty, sugary processed foods are absolutely no better than non-fatty, super-sugary foods. Both cause people to over eat. Fatty processed foods just as much as sugary processed foods. That's the problem. Those foods are literally designed to make you into an addict. Fat and sugar are both rewards for the brain.   There is nothing wrong with carbs. There is nothing wrong with white rice or starchy foods. Much of the worlds population gets half its daily calories from rice. There is nothing wrong with potatoes.   There are no simple answers such as idiots  like yourself attempt to propagate. Stop being a moron and making the same mistake that you make fun of others for. At least they admitted their mistake.

Glad to see they are continuing their tradition of making blatantly wrong recommendations.   The data suggest that the change in body fatness that occurs with modifying intake of sugars results from an alteration in energy balance rather than a physiological or metabolic consequence of monosaccharides or disaccharides.   http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7492   Despite the epidemiological parallel between the marked increase of obesity and fructose consumption, there is no direct evidence linking obesity to the consumption of physiological amounts of fructose in humans (â¤ 100g/day). A moderate dose (â¤ 50g/day) of added fructose has no deleterious effect on fasting and postprandial triglycerides, glucose control and insulin resistance.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991323/   In conclusion, a high-sucrose intake as part of a balanced, eucaloric, weight-maintaining diet had no detrimental effect on insulin sensitivity in healthy nondiabetic subjects compared with a low-sucrose diet.   http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/55/12/3566.long   From the studies reviewed, it would appear that a moderate dietary sucrose intake at levels up to 25% of energy appears to have no significant adverse effects on lipid or carbohydrate metabolism in normal healthy adults when substituted for starch, at least in the medium term (several weeks).   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630450/   First, there is no unique relationship between HFCS and obesity. Second, there is broad scientific consensus that there are no significant metabolic or endocrine response differences or differences in health-related effects between HFCS and sucrose. Third, the metabolism and health effects of both HFCS and sucrose are different from those observed in studies that compare pure fructose with pure glucose, neither of which is consumed to any appreciable degree in the human diet. Fourth, recent randomized clinical trials have suggested that there are no adverse effects on total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or HDL cholesterol at amounts ranging up to the 90th percentile level of fructose consumption, although other investigators have shown increases in cholesterol and/or LDL cholesterol in subjects consuming either sucrose or HFCS (66, 68â70), so further research studies are needed to clarify this issue.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649104/   The meta-analysis shows that fructose intakes from 0 to â¥90 g/d have a beneficial effect on HbA1c. Significant effects on postprandial triacylglycerols are not evident unless >50 g fructose/d is consumed, and no significant effects are seen for fasting triacylglycerol or body weight with intakes of â¤100 g fructose/d in adults.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/5/1419.long"

One thing that I've done is since they're relatively easy to cook, I do my own versions at home with smaller amounts of oil.

I have been thinking about investing in a rice cooker but I also don't want to eat rice too often. If you own a rice cooker, do you find it easy to make chicken and vegetables in it?

nutrition,36tofp,FrigoCoder,1 point,Fri May 22 10:18:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm.....since you don't have a kitchen I think it would be a good idea to invest in a rice cooker. Apparently its quite versatile for cooking a variety of recipes. That way you also partially gain some control over your own cooking. I've never tried any myself but there are plenty on the internet you can find, here are some lists I've come across:  http://www.buzzfeed.com/arielknutson/surprising-things-you-can-make-in-a-rice-cooker#.uu3eknEXkd  http://greatist.com/eat/super-surprising-rice-cooker-recipes  I'm sure it could work just as well for steaming vegetables as well. In terms of the vegetables I eat, I generally eat a lot of leafy greens. Here are some thai-specific ones I think you can find: - Chinese kale (kha na (à¸à¸°à¸à¹à¸²)) - Bitter melon leaves (take care, they're...well, bitter. bai mara (à¸¡à¸°à¸£à¸°)) -Ivy gourd leaves (tum leung (à¸à¸³à¸¥à¸¶à¸)) - Any sorts of mushrooms are a great bet All of the above can be cooked with a soya sauce.   I found this website that has some pictures of typical thai ingredients you can use as a sort of reference for when you want to go to the market: http://www.thaitable.com/thai/ingredients  I'm not sure about how it works with the meat absorbing eggs, since with heat meats generally release some fats. Any sort of suki is a healthy bet in my opinion, and hot pot restaurants like MK are good for clean eating. Phat phak is also good. Sure it has oil, but it's not as greasy. Anything that you cook in a pan is likely to have oil, but it's not the oil itself that's necessarily bad, more like the quantity that is used in some cases. Generally most of the phad stuff are done in a sort of soya sauce, but that's not too bad as long as you don't drink the sauce it comes with.   Other things I think you could try for street food- noodle soups are generally common and good. If you go for the ones with fresh meat and vegetables (nua sod, kuai tiew kai, etc.) rather than ones with pre-made meat/pork/fish balls its even better. If you want to avoid carbs then you can just go for ""kao lao"" where they make it without any noodles. Usually they have bean sprouts for you to add to your liking so you can heap them on. I usually do that.   You could also go for options such as grilled pork/chicken/fish or satay (go easy on the peanut sauce).  I think that the larb and other stuff like grapao are okay since they aren't generally swimming in oil as much as the omelete is. The nice thing I think about larb/som tum or yum salads are that they usually have some raw veggies on the side and you can be versatile in the sort of meat you want in them. Plus som tum/yum salads are mostly raw. The key I think is just to be conscious of how these dishes are cooked and the amount of sugar that can go in some dishes.   I actually grew up living in Thailand, though recently I've been living abroad, so I started attempting to cook for myself. Good luck in your quest for clean eating!

The best way to know that is to talk to the doc/pharmacist that knows her specific situation and medication regimen. Some antibiotics have a lot of interactions and can be significantly affected by what is consumed with them (based on the duration of antibiotics I'm guessing she may have tuberculosis, and those antibiotics need to be taken in a very specific and consistent manner).

Several double blinds have shown efficacy though, so the best advice I have is to research individual brands and what they've been tested for (ie antibiotic induced diarrhea vs Chrone's). Foods are something that haven't been studied extensively, but I think personally that they have much more potential because the bacteria have something to actively feed on. Yogurt and kefir are good, but if she can tolerate them I think that the veggies are even better (because they aren't initially pasteurized). Look for live sauerkraut, kimchi, or other lacto-fermented pickles. Treat them like condiments, have her munch on them in small amounts throughout the day.

You will be less motivated to change behavior on inadequate sleep. You will also feel more hungry, less full once you're done eating, and be more likely to choose unhealthy, processed foods on a poor night of sleep compared to when you've had a full night of rest.  Second, go find an activity that you enjoy. This could be hitting the gym, running, biking, hiking, whatever. People are more likely to stick to exercise routines that they enjoy and don't feel like they ""have to"" go. Instead they go because they want to go.  Third, you should change your habits in a new environment. Studies show that the easiest way to form new habits is in new environments. Researchers suggest changing habits on vacation because you're away from home/work/etc.  On average, it takes 30 days for habits to form, so if you want to exercise more, try going outside.

Then when I practiced acceptance, and tried to see it as fun and positive and never forced myself to eat the ideal meal, really analyzed my cravings for GOOD food, it became so much easier.  Everyone's different, my husband just straight forces himself to eat less and he can do that. I absolutely cannot.  Thinking about what NOT to eat or calories makes me crazy.  Adding veggies and thinking positively is what works for me and not him."

These habits become a lifestyle, and this sustainability is what gets you the results you need.  Hope this helps!  Edit: Another big thing for me is prioritization.

I was lucky enough to find a PT that was cheap enough that I could go to 4 times a week, and we've become friends, so its like working out with a buddy.  Since starting this amount of exercise, its also made it easier to eat better, because I don't want to ruin all the work I've done.  Biggest this to remember with weight loss is that your nutrition is 80% and exercise is 90%.

""You're probably familiar with the difference between fat soluble and water soluble vitamins, and that pouring out a broth for instance wastes a great deal of the water soluble ones (Vitamin C and the B's). Looking into your question I found that air, heat, light, and pH all pose risks for vitamin content. More specifically though, the only clearly documented degradation with heat occurs with vitamin C and Thiamin (B1). This study  PDF WARNING by the Journal of Food Engineering looked specifically at different types of heating and Vitamin C and showed significant degradation (by 50% or more) above 70 degrees F. For car temps that is pretty mild, I've often seen mine hit 110+ during the warmer months. Thiamin is a bit more heat stable but will also show degradation above 100 degrees F. I couldn't find exact values, but Pantothenic Acid (B5) and Folate are also at risk. I'm fairly certain the first two will have some degradation in your products."""

nutrition,36mknv,NutritionThrowaway12,21,Wed May 20 14:12:49 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer - I'm only answering this because I'm not very good at eating all of my raw fruits and vegetables, either. I also grew up in the south where vegetables/fruits either came from a can, or were cooked in tons of butter - so I know it's possible to make vegetables pretty delicious, but possibly a little less nutritional. So my advice is sort of a temporary experiment to see if you can acquire a taste for fruits/vegetables.   What are you blending into your smoothies? I can put a lot of spinach in my smoothies and hardly tell a difference. If you like bananas, have you tried just a banana and spinach smoothie with a little milk and/or greek yogurt? If you can develop a taste for that, you can eventually add other fruits - blueberries, strawberries, etc. For me, adding any other veggie than spinach is noticeable - so maybe just stick with spinach for now. Some people say avocado works well in smoothies, but I haven't personally tried it.  As for other veggies, smothering the steam-fresh broccoli in cheese helps a lot. I don't like the smell very much right after it has steamed in the bag, but it goes away pretty quickly. Salt/Pepper/lots of cheese makes it pretty delicious.  If you like potatoes, branch out into 'root vegetables' a little more - try eating sweet potato (with the skin on!) and add a little butter/brown sugar. Look up a recipe of honey glazed carrots. Zucchini and Squash are also really good sliced and baked in the oven with olive oil, salt, pepper, and cheese.   Green beans can be pretty amazing when properly fried in a pan with butter, salt & pepper, and sliced almonds.  Carrots dipped in a moderate amount of ranch dressing or french onion dip is good, but those are not very nutritional and have a lot of calories. But if you're trying to like carrots, maybe it's an ok place to start. Small bites might be helpful, too!  Spreading peanut butter on apples may help mask the flavor/texture, but be careful - peanut butter is a high calorie food, and it's easy to eat a lot of it!  Pizzas are a pretty good way to sneak vegetables in, too - peppers, spinach, tiny bits of broccoli, avocado, pretty much anything. And you can blend spinach into the pizza sauce.   You could also google 'how to sneak veggies into food.' There are lots of parenting websites that have tricks on sneaking veggies into toddler food - maybe a tad humbling, but helpful?  And again - I don't think this is a great way to eat veggies/fruits ALL the time, it may be a way to get your body used to them so eventually, you can enjoy raw fruits and vegetables."

nutrition,36mknv,naturalveg,14,Thu May 21 01:45:01 2015 UTC,"My first two thoughts are baby steps and persistence. You like junk food because you eat junk food. If you eat vegetables, guess what you will start to like?   I grew up on junk food too. As I watched my elders decline in health, I realized that I didn't want to end up like them and needed to learn how to prevent that. Of course, the first thing I found was that eating fruits and veggies prevents most common chronic diseases.  People often just refer to fruits and veggies as the healthy foods, but grains, beans, nuts and seeds are health-promoting and disease-preventing as well. You may find those more palatable, and even if it takes you a long time to increase your fruit and veggie intake, you can be so much healthier just by replacing your junk food with grains, beans, nuts and seeds.  I started by basically just forcing myself. I didn't have as strong a reaction as you did, but I certainly didn't enjoy it at first. I started with steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. It was quick and easy to make. I probably over-steamed them, but when they're mushy I find them more palatable. I still overcook most of my veggies. Also at the beginning I just added veggies to everything I was eating. Picking up a sub at subway? Extra veggies! Having pasta? Add tomatoes, peppers and onions into the sauce.  A baby step you might want to try, maybe you already have, is adding small amounts of veggies into what you're eating. Get peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc on your pizza. Each bite of fried chicken you eat must have a bite of carrot or greenbean on the same fork, even if its a big piece of chicken and a tiny piece of veg. Each spoonful of ice cream must have a slice of strawberry or peach. When you start to get used to that, make the veg pieces bigger, and then later add another bite of fruit/veg alone in between bites of chicken+veg or ice cream+fruit.  Do you like burritos? I find they're a delicious way to get more veggies in your diet. You don't even have to look at them while you're eating! I absolutely love burritos with rice, beans, salsa, guacamole, lettuce, onions, peppers. Yum.   I also suggest trying different ethnic foods. I love indian food - I get bean and veggie dishes and the spice blends that they use are really delicious. I love thai food too, thai coconut curry is so yummy - its a coconut milk soup with lots of veggies and little spice. The flavors of the sauces in indian and thai food make a world of difference.   Also, its really important to experiment with different ways of cooking. Veggies can taste really different based on how they're cooked. There are some veggies that I like best steamed (broccoli), some are good sauteed, but most of the time I think veggies are best roasted.  If you are persistent, you WILL warm up to them over time. Start a chart, make it a game for yourself. See how many fruits and veggies you can eat this week, and next week try to beat it. I will reiterate a point that I think is important - if fruits and veggies are hard for you, then focus on grains, beans, nuts and seeds instead. They are so much healthier than what you are eating, so if you can replace the junk food with that you'll be so much better off. Then keep working on the veggies. Good luck!"

Incorporate more protein rich foods into your diet to replace things like fried chicken (chicken breast, salmon).  How about things like mushrooms, how do you feel about those? Sauteed mushrooms?"

Once they are soft and squishy, let them cool a bit and scrape out the insides.  Mash them up with a potato masher, or blend them in a food processor. (I use a miniature one for convenience).  Then, I add about 1/2-1 cup to my favorite cheese sauce for mac and cheese.

Your sick and off feeling is the same way I feel after prolonged periods away from Enzyme rich sources.  You can get Enzymes mostly from raw foods. You don't get much from centrifugal juicers due to ionization and heat factor obliterating the nutritional value ( Nutribullet is a just a mass marketed lie )  Also, purple cabbage calms my stomach, green cabbage can too, but it causes gas. The Purple variety doesn't give off gases.  Potatoes are GREAT!!! With the skins on, most of the nutritional value in potatoes is directly under the skin.  Steer clear from dairy. It is mucus forming. So are red meats, poltry, pork.... It all causes mucus.  Some of my favorite nutritional sources is Arnold Erhet with the Mucusless diet and Dr. Max Gerson with his Gerson Therapys. Learned so much what the body's natrual processes demand in terms of nutrition and food. You can find great, easy to follow vidoes on these guys on youtube.  I empathize with your inability to eat vegetables.  I recently lost 100lbs myself with diet and exercise and a calorie deficite like yourself. Ask yourself, does a dick know what an inch is? No. Does your body have an idea what a calorie is? No. IT's a unit of measurement... Not a truly, living, active substance your body craves.  I empathize, again... But I do not have sympathy for the inability to eat what should be 95% of every human's diet. Fruits, and vegetables. Mostly salads. I was just like you, brought up meat and potatoes home. Protein every night for dinner.. It's just a matter of education really. Once I educated myself, I swore off all proteins except for white fish occasionally from Tilapia or similar fish. I might have that once or twice a month.. Besides, I've got an expensive ass juicer that extracts protein from raw fruits and vegetables. It isn't nearly as concentrate as say.. Vitamin A, E, K, B6, B12.  Living enzymes will help you conquer this sick, lethargic feeling, also can turn your stomauch around. Maybe you need to balance out your stomauch acids? Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar (with the mother, it's a must) will help aid your stomauch in it's attempts to balance the levels of acids in your gut. There is a drink, on the side of the bottle 2tbsp to 10oz of water. The ACV HAS to have this living mother in it, as it contains an enzyme that aids your gut.  An apple a day is no joke. Carrot juice is sweet, and when it's cold pressed is SO PACKED with vitamins and enzymes.  Also, find an Iodine supplement! Salt, inhibits your thyroids ability to process Iodine efficiently(funny how it's added to salt huh? Morons...) Iodine is so critical and probably something like 99% of us never get enough.  Sorry if any of it was harsh. I got harsh on myself!  I haven't eaten red meat in probably something like 6 years. Chicken? 6 years... Pork.. Same. I would have issues sleeping I had so much energy (I was exercising lifting weights for 45 minutes, running on a treadmill for 30 minutes, jumping rope then after for 15 minutes, then after that boxing for 15-18 minutes.

Enzymes are proteins. One function of your GI tract during digestion is to break down proteins into amino acids, which the body with use later in protein synthesis (among other things). This is high school science.   I'm going to agree that there are benefits of increasing the amount of raw (or otherwise) plant matter in one's diet. None of these benefits have anything to do with this ridiculous concept of increasing or decreasing mucus.   How about some peer-reviewed sources to back up some of these mucusless diet claims?

Arnold Ehret CURED HIS OWN DISEASE through a MUCUSLESS DIET. I think he saw.... 32 doctors? I'm sure those guys were highly intelligent, without a doubt. But people like Arnold Erhet are the ones who stand out. Naturopathy is a huge sector of health and it's being more and more widely promoted by doctors who do conventional therapies such as chemoradiation with cancers. Now it's chemoradation, and you have an nutritionist put you on a strict diet...(Dr. Max Gerson would have loved to have treated any cancer patient prior to chemoradtion, but he was able to cure people of cancer even after chemo, their bodies are just that much more weakend and volitile to an extensive regimine of his therapies. Things have changed. Food isn't what it used to be in the 1800s. Even the 1900s.

I took matters into my own hands. So glad I didn't have someone who has little true caring and consideration for my health telling me and guiding me down the only path he knows.  Like the doctor, who recommended my sister birthcontrol for her stomauch ulcers... Trust me, a few bad experiences and you take matters into your own hands.  If you think Mucusless diet is bullshit, I invite you to go to Tijuana Mexico and visit the Gerson Institute there, someone with an  agressive form of cancer is there right this second, a late stage form of cancer, early signs of cancer. Why is it in Mexico? Do your research, if you are a doctor here in the states practicing his proven to work, even in the 1920's therapies you get your license to practice revoked. End of story. A few doctors have popped up that will 'consult' you on how to perform the therapy yourself. That is all they are legally allowed to do. The pharmecutical companies don't make money growing fruits and vegetables. Some of the main principles of the diet are damn near the same... Juices from fruits and vegetables. Fresh foods.

The wiki pages you provided are for endogenous human enzymes. I'm not seeing how this relates to ingesting plant enzymes.   Dr. Gerson is a quack The reason doctors in the US will have their license revoked is because there is no compelling evidence that eating plant matter will cure cancer. Gerson therapy is rejected by the National Cancer Institute as an effective treatment for cancer.  Doctors are people, and people make mistakes. You having a handful of personal anecdotes about times that doctors have made an error does not disprove all of evidence-based medicine.   I might add that personal attacks do not serve to strengthen your argument. In fact, it does the opposite.

It's far from here: eat this plant matter; you are cured! It can be an extensive, daily regimine that can span 5-6 years with certain cancers. There are supplementation, one of the base principles is to remove all salt from the diet, begin replacing the salt which is saturated in your body with K, potassium, one of the main nutrients needed by your bodies immune system. By overdosing the potassium and other nutrients, the ideal is your immune system attacks it. Coffee Enemas contain an active enzyme as well, and a specific charge, this charge(just like your HVAC machines which pull dust to the floor that was previously floating) the coffee's charge pulls negatively charged excito/other toxins from your blood stream due to the fact your blood passes through your colon three times in 12 minutes. ( You can see Dr. Russel Baylock talking about similar findings and aspects of nuerotoxins/excitotoxins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nxLm2LAPQo ) Many of the newly developed cancer drugs trigger responses in YOUR OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM to fight the disease. Gerson has been doing that since the 20s. So, yes... Eating a shit ton of salads and raw meals with something like 8-10 juices a day, with (depending on your toxicity) 5-8 enema's a day. Along with iodine supp., potassium salts added to every juice, a niacin flush, etc...etc... etc... You give your body a fighting chance.  Your source sucks. And attitude.

nutrition,36mbqy,anbeav,1 point,Wed May 20 13:17:34 2015 UTC,Pretty sure. The numbers I gave were just an example not real numbers.
nutrition,36mbqy,anbeav,1 point,Wed May 20 14:26:34 2015 UTC,Yes but that matters. It's usually 50 g or so different so there's no issue weighing raw as you haven't lost much liquid content
nutrition,36mbqy,chulbert,1 point,Wed May 20 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"Clarification:  I buy a pack of chicken breasts that says it contains 2.25 lbs of chicken breast. The composition of this chicken breast is as follows:  M + W = T  Where, M is the weight of the pure meat and W is the weight of the water and/or blood inside of the chicken breast and T is the total weight (2.25).  Now, some time has passed and this chicken breast has been sitting in the package and some water/blood has leaked out of the chicken breast and into this absorbent pad that they have put inside of the packaging. Now the composition of the chicken breast is as follows:  M + W' = T'  Where W' is the water/blood still remaining inside of the chicken and T' is how much the chicken breast weighs now that it has lost some water (1.75). Again, these are purely fictional numbers. The other night I had a pack of chicken that was 4.2 lbs and actually weighed out to 3.8 or so.  When counting calories and macros we are given the those values per 4 oz of chicken. Let's assume that all of the caloric content is inside of the meat (which is probably true but I think that blood has protein in it). So, let's just say that the 2.25 lbs of chicken is labeled as 990 calories (2.25 lbs = 36 oz, at 110 cals/4 oz of chicken). That means that the entire package of chicken I am cooking contains 990 calories. However, if I weigh it again and use 1.75 lbs then I'll think I am consuming 770 calories (1.75 lbs = 28 oz)."
nutrition,36mbqy,atomant30,2,Thu May 21 00:16:26 2015 UTC,"You know what? I've answered my own question.  The caloric content of the chicken cannot change (significantly, I assume) by means of the lost water. The best I can do is assume that the nutritional information includes the weight of the water that was originally in the chicken.  Thanks for helping me think this through."
nutrition,36mbqy,atomant30,1 point,Thu May 21 00:18:46 2015 UTC,"It counts if you eat it, otherwise it doesn't.  :)"
nutrition,36mbqy,chulbert,2,Wed May 20 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"Except that's not how the calories are calculated. If there is water weight or whatever in the food, it is accounted for in the calorie calculation.   So, for example, 4oz of frozen chicken is like 110 calories. When you cook it it will come out at under 3 ounces. You still count all 4 ounces."
nutrition,36mbqy,atomant30,1 point,Wed May 20 22:52:15 2015 UTC,That's not even my real concern here. I am aware of the difference in weight before and after cooking. My concern is the calories/lb. If the chicken packaging people package the chicken that's packed with X calories/lb and then while it's being transported and/or sitting around waiting for me to cook it some of the water/blood gets absorbed by the weird chicken breast tampon thing the put in the package then the raw chicken I am weighing is now Y calories/lb.  Does that make sense? I feel like I haven't made myself clear.
nutrition,36mbqy,chulbert,1 point,Wed May 20 23:45:22 2015 UTC,"It makes sense. If the package says there is 1 pound of chicken and 440 calories, for example. And you weigh it at 14 ounces because 2 ounces were soaked up, it's still 440 calories  But like the other guy said, it shouldn't be very much being soaked up"
nutrition,36mbqy,atomant30,1 point,Thu May 21 00:06:19 2015 UTC,"Um what?  No.  Water does not contain calories so I'm not sure how you account for it in the calorie calculation.  Clearly raw and cooked chicken have different amounts of calories by weight, cut, and preparation style.  My point was simply that you count what goes in your mouth, not what doesn't, at whatever point in the process you tabulate."
nutrition,36mbqy,fitwithmindy,2,Thu May 21 12:10:51 2015 UTC,"This sub is a dumpster fire of misinformation.

I would be curious to know my list can be optimised.  They're chosen for some balance of convenience/taste/theory hence ease of sticking to it.  Sorted by importance/frequency... direct answer to ""if only 5"":-   [1] broccoli  - raw (snack) or stewed with the rest.. whole head every day.. thats' my ""Alpha-vegetable"". Sometimes I'll diet with just tuna/turkey+brocoli. [2] apple - convenient snack, (replaces junk) [3] banana - cheap, tasty, throw in blender with protein-powder/etc [4] tomatoes .. taste nice.. [5] mushrooms .. taste nice and supposedly more protein.. being a different kind of life form, likely to be complimentary.   Then sometimes also...   [6] cabbage  .. not always on sale.. bulks the stew out.. [7] peppers [8] grapefruit, again good in blender.. [9] babycorn [10] leeks [11] celery (raw or cooked,easy snack) [12] lettuice (raw, easy snack) [13] beetroot [14] spinach sometimes, these days [15] carrots, snackable (I think I should try these more often..) [16] oranges (only sometimes because I prefer grapefruit)   I know it sounds like 'broscience' but I'd read varied colours is a sign of varied nutrition, if you don't have a spreadsheet at hand. I realise 'different coloured peppers' or 'different coloured apples'  doesn't count toward that, rather adding peppers is more likely to add something I didn't already get than adding yet another kind of leaf..  I had read something specific about tomatoes but thats' another reason they appear as a high-priority, they keep it interesting. Contrasting to that message I've been throwing spirulina,tumeric in lately turning everything pondscum/muddy :)  I just find as many different things as possible to throw in the pot, I count lentils more along with grains since I might just have grain/meat or grain/protein-powder/milk instead  (EDIT, much like the OP, i'm considering 'fruit+vegtables' i.e. contrasting to high energy staples & protein sources. we have this '5-a-day' message. i guess he's thinking 'which 5')"

nutrition,36ihgq,MidnightSlinks,5,Tue May 19 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"Because they are typically part of an overall healthier meal. When you eat a cup of noodles, that's typically it. So you get refined carbs, like 1 tablespoon of vegetables and a day's worth of sodium all in one meal.  When you eat pasta, you at least have tomato sauce on top of your refined carbs, maybe some vegetables in the sauce, and probably some extra protein and fat in the form of meat and/or cheese to slow down digestion. When you eat bread in a sandwich, hopefully you have some lean meat and vegetables between those slices of refined carbs. But that doesn't mean that eating a pound of plain pasta or half a loaf of bread as a whole meal are healthy by any stretch of the imagination."
nutrition,36ihgq,billsil,1 point,Tue May 19 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"Because with the cup of noodles all most people get is the noodles.  With a sandwich you're getting some meat or some peanut butter, maybe some lettuce and tomato.  That will all reduce the glycemic index.  Also MSG, which is just a scapegoat.  You can eat a fair amount of trash and still be reasonably healthy, but you can be a lot healthier if you cut that all out.  Still, in the grand scheme of things, I'd take a cup of noodles over a soda.  Both are at the extreme of refined carbs, but one is a lot worse for you.  Glycemic index (or load) is not the only thing that matters."

Putting fruits or veg in a blender to make a smoothie makes it easier to ingest out of convenience but it isn't inherently healthier, you just remove chewing from the equation.

I do think fruit and leaves are healthy, but perhaps humans have evolved to eat less fruit and leaves and more starch and meat. This is just a theory though. I'm personally dubious of the claim that these differences allow us to conclusively determine the ""ideal human diet"".   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2377015/"
nutrition,36joe1,MPfiff,1 point,Tue May 19 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.   So if bonobos have bigger large intestines for fermenting fiber that means they are getting energy in the form of medium and short chain triglycerides from the fermentation process. That's all well and good but if this is intended to be the main source of energy for them, they would have diets similar to Gorillas which they don't....This must mean that the majority of their calories are coming from SUGAR in the fruit and to a lesser extent from the animal products.   When you say humans have evolved to eat less fruit and leaves and more starch and meat I feel like that is making a bit of a leap. We may have evolved to be able to survive that way but I don't think you can scientifically make the case that eating less fruits and vegetables somehow makes for healthier humans..."

I don't think evolved traits necessarily indicate what is best. However, if someone wants to look at Bonobos to try to develop a hypothesis on what is the best diet for humans I think it's more reasonable to look at biological differences between humans and Bonobos to see how the humans diet would be expected to be different and use that as a framework."

nutrition,36gc23,desert6flower66,2,Tue May 19 04:14:53 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, which is all anyone can do over the Internet anyway, I'd say your brain is seeking a compensating pleasure substitute. You say you have a sweet tooth, which means you're getting something from sweet foods in particular which you don't from other foods, including more complex carbohydrates.  Are you quitting cold turkey, vaping, using a patch/gum, or tapering off?   From what I recall, though I could be wrong, smoking tends to suppress appetite in some folks, so that might contribute, too. Really, it's hard to say.  The question is, is this a problem? Are you overly concerned about your sugar intake, for whatever reason? A lot of folks tend to gain some weight when they quit smoking, but at the end of the day, is that change going to lower your overall quality of life or raise it? That's really only something you can decide, and probably not even something you can say for sure right now.  All of that said, if you really want to kick the smoking and are worried about the sugar cravings, I'd say take it one step at a time, make sure you're past the nicotine addiction, then deal with the sugar. If that's not in the cards for whatever reason, consider some non-nutritive sweetener alternatives, if that's more your style. They can be a rather touchy subject, and people tend to lump them all into the same category, assuming the same effects for each, which is inaccurate at best, or just plain lazy analysis. I've found xylitol to be palatable, relatively easy to get, and lacking most of the common drawbacks attributed to some other sweeteners (you'll have to dig into that yourself, since the opinions and allegations are always changing.) It even has some benefits, including being prebiotic and improving oral health. But it can also cause digestive distress, especially if you don't ease into using it.   TL;DR - Sorry I can't give you a definitive answer, but most likely it isn't a micronutrient (vitamin/mineral) deficiency, and more along the lines of your brain seeking alternate pathways to trigger pleasure hormone release."

Is lutein better than lycopene is better than the ORAC score?  The ORAC score by the way...   A wide variety of foods has been tested using this method, with certain spices, berries and legumes rated highly in extensive tables once published by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), but withdrawn in 2012 since no correlation between test results and biological activity could be determined,[3] stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed in support of the free-radical theory.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity  You're better off just adding spices (the highest source of phytonutrients) which are already among the top sources of known nutrients anyways."

And you can get the B12 without the unhealthy baggage that comes from animal products. If you eat foods ranked favorably in Lalonde's system do you have your bases covered not just from a survival standpoint but from an optimal health standpoint.

Obviously, but by not including nutrients that are overwhelmingly found in much higher concentrations animals (and that's before accounting for bioavailbility), you bias the rating system to make veggies look amazing and animal products look terrible.  Also, what's the logic for reducing meat's scores because it has cholesterol?  According to the new dietary recommendations, dietary cholesterol is no longer considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption as it doesn't increase blood cholesterol.  Granted it's a new recommendation, but do you think the rating systems that are pushed by vegetarians will be updated to reflect that?   And you can get the B12 without the unhealthy baggage that comes from animal products.    Such as?  Refined grains or soda (e.g. fast food)?  Those are vegan products.

And yet here we are.  Not everyone agreed with the recommendations to limit cholesterol back in the 1970s (they were just removed).  With better data, recommendations will change, but  they are what they are.   Industry and science need to continue to develop more specific biomarkers of health and develop a better understanding of what happens to many of these bioactive flavonoid compounds during the digestion and absorption process. The expectation has never been that any one in vitro assay, regardless of its nature, would truly reflect everything that happens during this process. Without the ORAC database, we would not have had the opportunity to gather important epidemiology data that we now have relating antioxidant intake and various disease endpoints. Those involved in marketing are encouraged to use the data available in a reasonable way backed up with the best science that is available.   As Prior says, the ORAC score is an in vitro system that is being used as a proxy for in vivo effects.  Why not at least try to correct for bioavaibility? It's not relevant otherwise.   No one plant contains all the beneficial phytochemicals, and there are probably undiscovered ones.   We should also include nutrients like carnitine then.  Why should we only include plant nutrients?   Studies in athletes have shown that carnitine supplementation may foster exercise performance. As reported in the majority of studies, an increase in maximal oxygen consumption and a lowering of the respiratory quotient indicate that dietary carnitine has the potential to stimulate lipid metabolism. Treatment with L-carnitine also has been shown to induce a significant postexercise decrease in plasma lactate, which is formed and used continuously under fully aerobic conditions. Data from preliminary studies have indicated that L-carnitine supplementation can attenuate the deleterious effects of hypoxic training and speed up recovery from exercise stress. Recent data have indicated that L-carnitine plays a decisive role in the prevention of cellular damage and favorably affects recovery from exercise stress. Uptake of L-carnitine by blood cells may induce at least three mechanisms: 1) stimulation of hematopoiesis, 2) a dose-dependent inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, and 3) the prevention of programmed cell death in immune cells. As recently shown, carnitine has direct effects in regulation of gene expression (i.e., carnitine-acyltransferases) and may also exert effects via modulating intracellular fatty acid concentration. Thus there is evidence for a beneficial effect of L-carnitine supplementation in training, competition, and recovery from strenuous exercise and in regenerative athletics.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212755"

No, it does not matter what kind of calories that you eat if you look specifically at weight loss. HOWEVER, this does NOT mean that you should start eating horribly. You must consider things like sodium content, glycemic index, calorie load, transfats, whether you are getting everything you need to be healthy (for example without proteins when your body digests muscle during exercise it won't build it back and you lose muscle), cholesterol content, etc..   Yes if you want to get very technical people might be able to make arguments that you might have a very slight difference in weight loss based on what kind of calories you consume. But the whole point of measuring the amount of energy that is in each bite of food that you take is to determine whether you're taking in more energy than you need or less, which determines whether you put on weight, lose weight, or maintain weight. What you're thinking of in the idea that if you eat healthy you'll lose weight is simply that many healthy foods contain less calories than unhealthy foods. If eating healthy foods meant that you would lose weight, let's consider when there were no processed foods, and when most things that you ate were healthy. Those individuals would lose weight constantly, and eventually die. They didn't because they ate enough calories to maintain a healthy weight. You should also remember that the unhealthiest of foods isn't actually unhealthy in small amounts. One bag of chocolate covered cheetoes isn't really bad for you if you just eat it once. It is eating it continuously and accumulating things in the body (like trans fats, cholesterol, etc.) that leads to bad health over a given time period. Occasional junk food isn't going to hurt you. Junk food every day for 10 years probably isn't gonna make you shit rainbows. Good question."

Yet, people have lived long, eating these very foods. Doctors/dietitians recommend Mediterranean diet which includes these stuff too.  On the other hand, the strict guidelines and ""black-or-white"" thinking prevalent in Paleo, may promote disordered eating and might contribute to orthorexia.

It sounds like you have simply 'heard' some things 'out there' about health and nutrition. No one can do this for you.    I'm not sure what your carb intake is, but aside from possible food related issues (gluten intolerant), most of your decisions will be based around your carb intake.    Why do I say this?    It is increasingly being show that at low carb / high fat diet (LCHF) is sustainable (some argue advisable) for athletes. Traditional research has show that if you a heavily carb focused, then you need to ensure a minimum amount of carbs as an athlete.    However, there is very little middle ground in choice here. Your best results will be if you are either fat adapted, or 'carb adapted'. There is not much (to my understanding) advantage, and in fact it could be a disadvantage, to go high fat, if you are still high carb.    For gluten etc. - get tested. There are test, not all of them are conclusive, but many can show if you have a reaction to a particular food.    I know some paleo people who do much better off beans, others can include no problems. Others stay away from dairy, while others thrive on it. You need to see what works for you.    The trick here, is to control what you are eliminating / adding, so you know can isolate cause.    There are some diets out there, which start off with you eliminating most of the known 'trigger' foods (eggs, dairy, grains, etc), and then you gradually, add them back in, one by one, and you see how you are feeling. This is a great way to isolate a potential problem food for you.    But again, the onus is on you, to read, research and implement, test."

Almost EVERYTHING that we eat nowadays is different than it would have been 10,000 years ago.

nutrition,36972v,ma-hi,-1,Mon May 18 03:34:02 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with your second point at all.   Your first point is at least debatable, as evidenced by the fact that scientists out there are debating it. I am not sensitive to wheat, but there are plenty of people (Celiacs and other) that are. So for them, bread today certainly is bad for them.   I personally don't eat bread because it displaces food with a much better nutrient profile. If wheat makes up too much of my diet (even whole grains), that will be bad for me. For many people, wheat and corn derived products make up a huge % of their diet. That is bad.  I also don't eat wheat because it causes a spike in my blood sugar and causes me crash an hour later. The GI of whole wheat is pretty much the same as white flour, and is worse than table sugar. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is also bad for you.  So, wheat may not be bad for everyone, but it is bad for many people, and just an ok ""filler"" for most others. If you like it and you can tolerate it, go ahead, but the only person wheat is ""good"" for is a starving person, IMHO."
nutrition,36972v,THE-Jackson-Hawley,2,Mon May 18 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"-There have been studies that have come out recently poking fairly big holes in claims of non-Celiac gluten sensitivity. And Celiac's disease is something that bedevils only a relatively small % of the population.  -Whole grains are great sources of dietary fiber and B-vitamins, and probably a number of phytochemicals and other micronutrients that are less-understood at the moment (though the fact that whole societies have survived on grans for thousands of years suggests that, at the very least, grains are an acceptable staple). not to mention steadily available long-term energy for those who like to be active.  -Glycemic index doesn't tell the whole story of what happens when your body actually digests a food. The literature at present does not favor the idea that whole grains contribute to diabetes, and the prominent diabetes organizations don't recommend diabetics stay away from whole grains.  Perhaps the science will eventually swing around on whole grains, but for now, the scientific evidence that IS available strongly favors whole grains as an acceptably nutritious, healthful part of an average person's diet. I've never, ever seen the anti-grain advocates make a solid argument against their being a moderate to important component of a diet. At best, they have Taubesian speculation and little studies and hypotheses from the margins of scientific research, but it's all speculation and implication."
nutrition,36972v,ma-hi,-1,Mon May 18 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"Your original claim was that there is ""no evidence"" that bread was bad; I provided some pretty good evidence that bread was bad for at least some people, but conceded that there is still some question over how bad for the population as a whole.   You seem to be agreeing with me, so let's leave it at that shall we?  In the meantime, I will replace the bread in my diet with better sources of fiber, vitamins, and nutrients, since I don't feel like taking an unnecessary risk with my health while I wait 50 years for the nutrition establishment to update their guidelines and get out of bed with the agribusiness lobbists."

If you'd like to provide even a single study suggesting any kind of long-term health issue with whole grains, a single study suggesting any kind of link between diabetes and whole grains, let alone a body of evidence suggesting that the current nutritional guidelines recommending the consumption of a food that humans have had 10,000 years to adapt to are a product of ""agribusiness lobbyists"", rather than, y'know, that long history of it providing sustenance and the weight of the evidence thus far, I'm all ears."
nutrition,36972v,ma-hi,-1,Tue May 19 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"Backtrack if you like, but it is (potentially) quite a large subset of the population that may have health issues with wheat. The jury is still out despite what you might suggest. From your statements earlier, you seem pretty sure of yourself, something I would not be given the lack of clear evidence on the actual prevalence of Celiac and wheat (not just gluten) sensitivity.     As for research, you can use Google and pubmed as well as I can, and you know that there are a good (and growing) number of studies out there that raise legitimate questions about wheat. Of course, there are plenty of others that suggest that whole grains are healthy too, and you have to use your own judgement to pick the good science from the bad.   I personally am suspicious of any study that seems to support the establishment position, which is that health take a back seat to profits. This applies to agriculture, the food industry and drug companies. There is more money to be made prolonging the problem than actually fixing it. And there is plenty of profit in wheat, corn and soy.   One more thing while I am ranting. Even if wheat was healthy, I would still question whether we as a species should be eating it (or corn. or soy) based on its environmental impact. Modern varieties simply cannot be grown sustainably and require and abundance of fertilizers and pesticides to thrive. That is in many ways a bigger issue than the health of the population.

Already, we're off the rails because the original posit was about the effect of grains on healthy individuals, but regardless, it says nothing about whole grains.  -Fifth study is the only one that is actually about the concerns you've raised, but even then, it's quite equivocal and innuendo-laden, and mentions that whole grains DO improve some measures of health.

In summary, I have not found clear evidence of an increase in the gluten content of wheat in the United States during the 20th century, and if there has indeed been an increase in celiac disease during the latter half of the century, wheat breeding for higher gluten content does not seem to be the basis.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573730/   Unrecognisable compared to what it was because of thousands of years of selective breeding.

nutrition,368yej,sativasun,3,Sun May 17 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure about that. I can tell you certain hormones are released in response to certain macro types (ex: CCK - a satiety hormone - is released in response to presence of protein and fat, not carbs), but I'm not sure if the single hormones are powerful enough to cause a different physiological response depending on if you are short in one macro versus another. Another thing to consider is that it would be pretty unusual to get only one macro without others. Even vegetables, which are mainly carbs, do have small amounts of protein. Finally, the last thing to consider is that it probably wouldn't matter if your body didn't get enough carbs but did get enough protein, because you can convert protein to carbs. Our bodies are pretty smart, so it probably wouldn't put you into a food seeking behavior when you are fine on energy simply because you hadn't gotten a certain number of calories from carbs. Protein on the other hand, can't be made from carbs or fat... so not sure how that would work. Sorry I can't answer your question directly - just not sure!"
nutrition,368yej,dukec,4,Sun May 17 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"Short answer: We have some ideas, it's a very complex issue that we don't completely understand, but it's most likely some combination of normal hormonal responses produced by a person's body, and a very complicated population of organisms living in your gut.  I haven't taken a class specifically related to hunger, but I've had several neuroscience and physiology classes that covered hunger as a physiological process.  Your body is very adaptbale to food sources as long as it can maintain certain minimal vitamin/mineral levels required for production of biomolecules, functioning of enzymes, etc. As far as I know there hasn't been much done in the way of seeing what a protein only or carb only diet would do to an animals body, and it has definitely never happened (and been accurately recorded) in human studies. My guess would be that you can cause the cessation of hunger with any one type of food, as there are many different means of signalling to the brain that a meal has been consumed, from simple stretch receptors in the stomach to more complicated chemical based detection systems which all influence the brain and perception of hunger.  If those were the only factors, it would be a difficult, but solvable problem to figure out given enough funding and time. However, as we study the microbiome (collection of microorganisms) of the stomach and intestines, it's becoming clear that they have a strong influence on what it is that you want to eat, and every individual microbiome will be different from every other to some extent based on a ton of factors. Understanding the interactions between even a few microorganisms is a vast problem to tackle, let alone the vast diversity present in a single persons gut microbiome."
nutrition,368yej,FrigoCoder,1 point,Sun May 17 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"You do get cravings and dreams about carbohydrates on a low carb diet, at least initially. Not actual physical hunger for food. It is more of a mental hunger, and the realization that you forgot to eat."
nutrition,368yej,seaweed88,5,Sun May 17 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"That's a complex question because ""hunger"" will go away or lessen if a person goes a long time not eating, whether by choice or circumstance. There is also the theory that what your average person perceives as hunger is actually thirst. It seems counterintuitive but we've probably all experienced a time where we thought we were hungry, then drank something, and the ""hunger"" subsided.  I have gone long periods with little food and while the sense of hunger did diminish it never fully went away.  And of course, depending on the situation, ""hunger"" might actually be symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). I.e. weakness, fatigue, sweating, shaking."
nutrition,368yej,billsil,1 point,Sun May 17 18:11:25 2015 UTC,"I've willingly gone 6 days with no food.  My stomach never growled.  I never had a hunger pang.  On the last day, I constantly thought about food.  I kept coming back to the thought of food.  I thought about how I was going to kill my cat and had to repeatedly tell myself not to.  I felt as if I had to eat anything and that if I didn't within the next day or so, bad things would happen.  I knew I'd be fine for the next day or so.  Hunger is an uncontrollable desire to eat and eat anything.  You'll be in a hyperfocused state, which is great since if you actually were going to kill something, you'd need to be focused.  Your stomach growling is due to eating too many refined carbohydrates."

It is more of a need based feeling and is what eventually turns to starvation if not satiated. Appetite, on the other hand, is more of am external cue and is more about what the brain wants. This is much more variable, can be stimulated even when not hungry if a favorite food is smelled or a certain conditioned response is triggered, despite the body's physical needs. Appetite is much more situational and hunger is more primal and instinctual.  Hope that helps!"

Carbs, proteins and fats, and alcohol (not the greatest but works), are all sources of energy. Depending on what you use your food for and how you expend that energy. To my understanding (nutritional science major) carbs are great for energy, but so are fats. (Good) Fats are excellent sources for slower longer energy expenditures but (Good) carbs are a little better for quicker burst of energy. They both are utilized well either way but sometimes spending on the type of athlete you are, you may be able to notice and feel your energy levels deplete faster depending on your food intake. As for hunger. Balance is key between all of those possible energy sources, and then fine tune it according to what you do with your day or week.

As Michael Pollen says at the end of his video, Joel Salatin is improving the quality of the land, not degrading it.   are these supplements plant/fungus derived (mushrooms)   If you're taking mushroom-based supplements, you're taking Vitamin D2.  You need D3.  There are Vitamin D3 vegan supplements though.  Make sure you get the right one   Is there anything else i'm missing about milk/meat   It's actually quite difficult to get enough calcium without milk/cheese/yogurt/kefir or animal bones.  I'd suggest a supplement.  I'd also suggest eating ground flax to get some omega 3s and minimize your soybean/corn oil to reduce your omega 6s in order to improve the EPA->DPA->DHA conversion rate (omega 6 intake downregulates EPA->DPA step).  You can be a lot healthier than the average omnivore eating a vegetarian diet, but the average omnivore has a horrific diet with lots of sugar and refined grains."

Some are pretty simple and would lean towards natural in the truest sense of the word, and others have up to 40 steps.   The ""all natural"" label on food products is pretty flexible, and many nutritionists will argue it doesn't really mean a whole lot. That's because even if an ingredient comes from a natural plant, it may be extensively processed before it reaches its final form.

Now everyone suddenly needs to count them.  It's BS.  When friends of mine have gone on a low carb diet, they lose tons of weight because they just aren't hungry (low carb diets cut refined carbs, which aren't whole foods).  They'll ask me if they should eat and I tell them:  Eat when you're hungry.  If you're not hungry, don't eat.  You're body will let you know when you need to eat.  Eat until you're full and then a little bit more for good measure.  If you're over your caloric requirements for a day, chances are you'll eat less the next day.  You got fat over 20+ years.  Getting to your goal weight one month faster on a year of weight loss is not a big deal.  Oh yeah, and low carb diets are well known to suppress appetite.  It's a lot easier to lose weight if you're not hungry.  Beyond low carb diets=whole foods diets, there is not really a huge advantage to them unless you're diabetic.

Say that same guy goes and rides a bike for two hours and burns 2k calories, he should bump up his cals to 4k. He could keep his proteins at 800 and fats at 450 and bump his carbs up to 2187.5. If you're running marathons or cycling other endurance training, your carb intake should increase accordingly, right?"
nutrition,365wzl,alsoram,3,Sun May 17 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"Someone on a LCHF diet is trying to keep their metabolism preferentially oxidising fatty acids instead of glucose - so they are eating a fixed amount of carbs and protein, and a variable amount of Fat.  The amount of protein is based on the raw materials (amino acids) your body requires to maintain your lean body - so it's a fixed ratio of your lean body mass (ie: 0.6g/lbs).  The amount of carbohydrates someone adapting to burning fats would eat is fixed at the amount that would replenish liver glycogen stores sufficient to switch the primary fuel of the body from fat to glucose, which is 20-50g/day.  Everything else is fat.  If you are about to run a marathon you could eat the 2500ish kCal that you will burn in Fat.  But if your body has adapted to freely oxidizing fatty acids it doesn't matter if they are ones you just ate, or ones you stored several years ago in your love handles.  The critical distinction is that someone fueled mainly on fat can use their existing hunger/satiation signalling to determine when to stop eating and their energy homeostat will keep them close to their set weight.    For someone predominantly fueled by glucose, the hunger signalling can become disturbed by the insulin required to metabolise it - so you'd need to track calories in vs calories out or slowly gain weight."
nutrition,365wzl,Ifuqinhateit,1 point,Sun May 17 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"I'm less concerned with LCHF. I'd like to better understand if this approach of keeping protein intake at 1g/lb and fats at .25g/lb with variable carbs is a less desirable approach for cutting than varying fats, provided one is engaged in weight training, and, several hours of intense cardio per week while counting and consuming calories/macros to the g."
nutrition,365wzl,alsoram,1 point,Tue May 19 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest I don't understand the basis for the metric of .25g/lb of fat.  The level of essential protein, sufficient to avoid catabolism is in the range of .8-1.8 g/Kg of lean body mass depending on how much weight bearing exercise you do.  Cardio won't affect that, it'll probably just depress your metabolic rate if you are caloric restricted.  AFAIK the only essential fats are a few grams each of Omega 6 and 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, ideally roughly in even ratios and a small amount of fats used to curry fat soluble essential vitamins.  So the minimum essential fats may be a lot less than .25g/lb.  From my understanding of the biochem, the high levels of carbohydrates will require insulin which will shuttle those 50g or so of incoming fat straight into long term storage.  One advantage for lifters of high levels of insulin is that it is highly anabolic, but there are plenty of people over on /r/ketogains who have been low insulin for decades yet are mighty (eg: /u/darthluiggi ).  So it might be worth asking over there about the comparative advantages of fueling mainly from carbs or from fat for cutting."
nutrition,365wzl,alsoram,1 point,Tue May 19 12:10:40 2015 UTC,"Carbohydrates are preferentially burned.  You'll burn the glucose first and store the fatty acids, and once you have done that then you will get the fatty acids out of storage and burn those.    If you are on the insulin resistance spectrum (which 2/3rd of people are), reactive hypoglycemia will mean that once you have burned the glucose you will still have high levels of serum Insulin and your blood sugar will drop and that is when your brain will tell you to go get it a snickers bar, STAT.  Mars have an entire advertising campaign around this phenomenon - ""you're not you when you are hungry"".   Ad libitum dieters (ie: eat when you are hungry) on this kind of diet just keep refeeding glucose every 3-4 hours.  That keeps insulin high, which locks triglycerides in the fat cells.  There is some evidence that you can do this kind of diet for an extended time if you intermittently fast - this lowers your insulin to a level that allowed your fat cells to mobilize triglycerides they have stored.  People who can safely get most of their energy from Carbohydrates (low fat)  don't become obese because their energy homeostasis (hunger/satiation) is closely linked to their blood glucose - when they eat energy (because it's all glucose and things that turn into glucose) their BG rises so it becomes a proxy for their regulation of their calories in.  People who get most of their energy from fatty acid oxidation (LCHF) become well adapted to burn fat, and in a low insulin environment fat cells willingly give up triglycerides as the rest of the body fuels upon them.  IMO both Low fat and LCHF are reasonable strategies - it's the bit in the middle where the danger (and the standard american diet) lies."
nutrition,365wzl,Smashbros34,1 point,Sun May 17 06:46:27 2015 UTC,"I'm thin and not worried about gaining fat, is that the only downside to this kind of diet?  You say that you can do this kind of diet ""for an extended time"" with IF, what exactly does that mean? I do IF fasting where I eat all my food within a 4-5 hour window, should I be good?"
nutrition,365wzl,alsoram,1 point,Sun May 17 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yep.  If you aren't eating for 19 hours of the day you get a chance to spend a good chunk of the day at low levels of insulin.    Sure high insulin tells fat cells not to release fat, which may not be your immediate problem, but over time it can become a run away train.  Insulin makes you hungry.  It tells your liver to start converting excess glucose into triglycerides for storage.  So if you are eating more glucose than you need to refill your short term glucose storage (glycogen) then the insulin that it raises converts it to fat for long term storage.  And as long as your insulin is high, that's where it stays.  Beyond weight gain, Insulin also tells some cancer cells that conditions are good for them to multiply."
nutrition,365wzl,Smashbros34,2,Sun May 17 16:33:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for this.  What exactly would be a healthy ratio of fat to carbs?
nutrition,365wzl,alsoram,1 point,Sun May 17 19:08:01 2015 UTC,"Depends how your body responds to carbs.  If you tolerate carbs well it won't matter.  You eat carbs you'll get a quick spike of insulin, and it's very efficient and your glucose will be all cleared and insulin will drop faster than glucose (without reactive hypoglycemia) and then in your fasting window you can go back to burning the fat you just ate and stored, and the glucose surplus to requirement that your liver just made into fat and stored.  You can use the scale to tell if you are eating more than you burn or vice-versa - and adjust intake to compensate.  If you don't tolerate carbs well, you eat carbs and your insulin rises more slowly and doesn't work as well so your blood sugar stays high then eventually drops and overshoots - you'll know you're probably in this group if you become hungry 3 hours after eating a meal of carbs.  I would eat the minimum you possibly can get away with - mostly from low carb leafy greens.  And we'll probably see you over at /r/keto   There is another test that will tell you which group you are in - eat a moderate amount of carbs for 3 months then get an hbA1C blood test, which gives an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 3 months.  If you are under 5.5 you are fine, your body has been able to to lower glucose levels in your blood quickly to safe levels.  If you are over 5.5 then you're having trouble clearing glucose, if you are over 6 you are pre-diabetic, over 7 diabetic."

In general the risks outweigh the benefits because all the nutrients in raw meat can be gotten from other sources. Cultures such as the Inuit used to need raw meat and fish, because they didn't always have access to fruit and veggies.  Raw fish is different, but not necessarily better than cooked. Both are nutritious. Some nutrients are lost in cooking, while others become more available after cooking."

Also im playing with this idea because i believe it to be simpler. rather than have to learn lots of different recipes and buy lots of different food, i could just buy in bulk the items i know i need, and i would only need to learn one way to prepare those foods.  And a final question, what would you define as crap? foods that we see as ""bad for us"" aren't literally toxic, its my understanding that they contain high amounts of micro/macros that we dont need e.g. salt, surely if you ate everything in proportion there are no ""bad"" foods"

Anything with added sugar is no longer in a pure enough form to be considered strictly a complex carb or a simple carb -- at that point it's a packaged product or a prepared food, perhaps made with ingredients that are complex and/or simple carbs -- but its no longer useful to think of them in that way.    How much of that product is a simple(r) carb -- a faster carb (which is one that makes your blood sugar rise and fall rapidly).  How much of that product is a more complex carb -- a slower carb that makes your blood sugar rise more slowly and evenly.    It's not as obvious as you might think -- an apple which has a high sugar content is a slower carb, while a banana is just as natural and has about the same sugar but has a higher GI indicating it's a faster carb..

The ""over the barstool"" advice I would have for you is    keep your weight in good control  of the carbs you do have, choose moderate amounts and prefer to have the lower GI-index foods.  See http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods for some discussion on this.   Weight seems to be the primary factor in both preventing type 2 diabetes and controlling it.  That said, there are thin type 2's.   The second is controlling how ""spikey"" your blood sugar volatility is, which you can do even with carbs if you make them ""slower"" carbs considering their GI and their amounts.

Carbohydrates all become blood glucose after consumption; the only real difference between simple and complex as far as your blood glucose is concerned is the speed of that conversion. That does not mean you cannot eat carbs but it is wise to spread the load across several meals and snacks rather than the usual excessive load at breakfast (cereal and juice are not your friend) and slightly lower at lunch and dinner.  Consider buying yourself a home blood glucose meter and testing every few months at the critical indicative times: on waking and an hour after one of the three main meals. If you never see a number over 99 (or 5.5 outside the USA) on waking or 140 (~8) an hour after a meal, stop worrying.  The rules change once you are diagnosed; if that happens begin here."

nutrition,361s9k,8bitfix,3,Fri May 15 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that most dietitians would first recommend you to start eating breakfast on a regular basis.  If this really doesn't work for you, then obviously a new approach would be recommended.   But for most people, eating in the morning will not only give you energy for the day (and could even replace a cup of coffee, and give you real nutrition), it can also reduce cravings later in the day.   I notice some saying that eating in the morning may increase cravings and pecking around for food somehow, but I think for most this isn't true.  Once the body takes in the food and the brain responds, people generally feel satiety, or in other words, satisfied and content. Pecking around for food is an emotional and/or habitual response toward food and is not normal hunger. Most doctors, dietitians, and professionals will warn against these bad food habits.  I would recommend to eat breakfast, or at least start trying it for a few weeks. If you still somehow feel hunger later, try eating a breakfast higher is fiber, and maybe include higher protein (such as eggs of course) if you can."

Some things that have helped me with the same problem were to try each sub-group of FODMAP individually, to not be too restrictive if I don't have to (for example, I can have broccoli with little to no problem, but cauliflower is a whole other story. Also, apples are quite hard on me, but I can eat all the wheat/gluten in the world and be fine). Having enough protein and salt in the diet helped my digestion too. Chew your food at least 30 times or more, until it's mushy, that can make a huge difference. Reducing the stress exposiure and making sleep/exercises a priority will help as well. Also, experiment with probiotics. They don't have to be dairy based, sauerkraut is great (increase slowly) or they can even come out of a sacket/pill, but they tend to be more expensive. If you can, consider adding more fats and oils to your food (olive oil, almonds, avocados (warning, FODMAP), organic/grass-fed butter, egg yolks), since they can in some people improve digestion (since more bile is secreted by the gall bladder to emulsify them to be broken down by the lipases) and scramble you eggs rather than hard boiling them. If you go for bread, go for sourdough, but becareful with rye, since it's called the ""devil's fart"" for a reason.

It's quite restrictive but maybe if you skewed your diet more towards keto you might bring it into line.   It could be a bit of an allergy to something you eat a lot. You could also keep a food diary and make a note which meals are causing the problem then try and spot patterns.  Junk food and sugary foods can make this much worse for a lot of people, so cutting down on these where possible, will help.  Also, cruciferous veg like brocoli can, for some people cause loads of gas. Might just need to do some investigative work.  For me it's roasted veg.

I had success losing weight (also around 30 lbs.) on a low-carb diet last summer, but quickly gained it all back when I went off the diet.   It sounds obvious, but it didn't occur to me at the time... the problem with highly restrictive diets is that, while they may work, they only work for as long as you keep eating that way. And the more restrictive the diet is, the harder it is to eat that way for any extended period of time.  Now I'm on a more balanced diet and losing the weight again (albeit much more slowly... I'm about halfway to my lowest weight after three months). The trick for me was (1) to not be afraid of carbs, and even accept that carbs can be the greatest share of your calories in a balanced and healthy diet... provided that (2) you're restricting calories and exercising so that you maintain a significant but reasonable caloric deficit. Of course, it always helps to get your carbs from nutrient dense foods like whole grains and fruits and vegetables.  I would recommend firstly being thoughtful about planning meals. Use something like cronometer to track your calories if you're not already. It helps me tremendously to know what I'm going to eat for dinner in advance because then I just input that into cronometer, and work backwards to determine what else I can eat that day and still maintain the right amount of calories.   Also, I highly recommend taking some kind of basic class on nutrition if you can. I took a sequence of 100-level classes as my natural science prerequisite and it was extremely helpful. We were able to determine things like basal metabolic rate, percent body fat, daily energy expenditure etc., all of which help you to know how many calories you need to consume to lose or maintain weight.  The trick is to ultimately land on a way of eating that doesn't feel too restrictive (so you can maintain it) but is still healthy. I also had to change my thinking a little bit to not be so hard on myself if I go off the rails for a day or two. Because we're being moderate about dieting, ""off the rails"" isn't ever really too far off the rails, and there's no ""ruining"" a moderate diet. Just try again the next day to be moderate and track what you eat.   Sorry for the longwinded and often vague post, I wanted to offer encouragement above all else because I've been in a similar situation.

nutrition,35xk62,hivoltage815,2,Thu May 14 11:48:11 2015 UTC,"For me it comes down to two things and only two things:  (1) Eat the same amount of calories you burn.  (2) Favor foods that are lower in the glycemic index and try to completely cutout processed food.   Why? Because the more ""simple"" a carb is (AKA, the higher the GI) the quicker it is absorbed into your bloodstream and spikes your blood sugar which releases insulin and tricks your brain into thinking it's hungry when it's not, thereby becoming better at storing fat while simultaneously making you feel compelled to eat more.  You essentially want to eat carbs that your body takes time to digest. The more refined it is, the quicker it digests. This is why American obesity correlates with the rise of refined, over-processed foods.  Keto is taking that principles to the extreme which is great because it essentially makes you not have to worry about #1 much at all. But as a longterm lifestyle is more about individual choices:   A whole fruit over juice. Whole grains over ""white"" flours. More vegetables than starches. More low GI starches like yams and brown rice over higher GIs like potatoes and bread Don't forget legumes (beans!)   If you are strict about sticking with this principle and cutting out processed shit like Hostess snacks, oreos, etc. then what happens is you can start trusting your bodies signals and don't have to count calories anymore. When you are hungry, you eat and you stop when you are satiated. It is now a lifestyle rather than a diet; you shouldn't have to count calories the rest of your life.  If you put this out of whack with the high GI and processed foods, it becomes  far easier to gain weight and much harder to trust your bodies signals."

I made the mistake of chowing down loads of pasta and shit and became super addicted to carbs which was unhealthy and made me lethargic and fatter. I would suggest bringing things like sweet potatos, lentils (I can't remember other healthy and low GL foods)  into your diet slowly. You must be below 50g carbs a day atm so maybe have a week at 80g then a week at 120g. If you start eating pasta and pizza and shit though, your gonna be fucked because you will probably pig out and undo the progress you made. Good luck"

Yeah, they make a chemical in a factory in Detroit that they then spray their fries with to give them the classic McDonalds taste. Watch the documentary ""Supersize Me"" for a good look at how addictive and damaging the food is.  Realize that by buying McDonalds and any fast food, you support a system of terrible animal abuse, steroid/antibiotics use in animals, cancer causing pesticides on your food, and unsustainability in general.  I know it sounds extreme but buying fast food is anti-human. Once it clicks and you see how interconnected cheap food and the decline of human health and growth is, you'll get sick even thinking about eating that crap. I also noticed that after eating McD's fries I'd get bad headaches. Observe your body and how you feel after you eat. Good meals should make you feel satisfied and energetic afterwards, not sluggish and aching.   I went from LOVIN' IT and eating from dollar menues multiple times a week to never ever eating fast food anymore. What helped me was going vegetarian for a while. During that time I tried so many new types of food - Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, etc - and expanded my taste buds. Once you start eating better prepared food with rich and interesting flavors, fast food will seem so bland to you. Go out for a good burger made from scratch, prepared by an experienced cook who loves what he does, and support his small business and family, not a corporation who cares not of humanity.   I'm kind of rambling now but you get the point. It's food that isn't good for you, buying it supports a terrible company and terrible agriculture practices, and you can do so much better because you're an amazing person who deserves good meals. Try eating really healthy for a few weeks and notice the difference.   Last point. You're going to med school. I don't know what field of study, but obviously health and medicine should be important to you.

Essential nutrients are also defined by the collective physiological evidence for their importance in the diet, as represented in e.g. US government approved tables for Dietary Reference Intake.   Some categories of essential nutrients include vitamins, dietary minerals, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids. Different species have very different essential nutrients. For example, most mammals synthesize their own ascorbic acid, and it is therefore not considered an essential nutrient for such species. It is, however, an essential nutrient for human beings, who require external sources of ascorbic acid (known as Vitamin C in the context of nutrition).  Many essential nutrients are toxic in large doses (see hypervitaminosis or the nutrient pages themselves below). Some can be taken in amounts larger than required in a typical diet, with no apparent ill effects.

One thing I did too is I looked at EVERY nutrition plan I could find and researched it a little just go get an idea of how it works, what the expected results were, etc.  That really helped me in understanding macros as each plan had similar ideals but different application and explanation.  I hope that helps!!"

Typically, this refers to the body's cleansing through the function of kidneys and liver in addition to excretion functions to eliminate a substance from the body. In a medical context, half-life may also describe the time it takes for the blood plasma concentration of a substance to halve (plasma half-life) its steady-state. The relationship between the biological and plasma half-lives of a substance can be complex depending on the substance in question, due to factors including accumulation in tissues (protein binding), active metabolites, and receptor interactions.

I had no idea why and was told it was my body detoxing. Was that a lie? I also had started eating healthier after finding out I was pregnant, but was told to stay away from things like wheat grass shots or anything else that would cause a more sudden detox because the toxins would go to my placenta. Same for after birth for when breastfeeding (the body would get rid of toxins in any way it knew how, including breast milk).  Anyway, I'm not really concerned about it since I'm just eating normal healthy foods, but I'm still curious what made me feel so sick.

You get more of some types, less of others in order to process the kind of food you're putting in there. Or, junk food allows certain types of bacteria to thrive in larger numbers.  When you throw in something unfamiliar, your gut flora aren't balanced in the right types/proportions to deal with it as effectively. So when you have that wheatgrass shot, you don't have enough of the right bacteria to process it OR the ones used to junk don't process wheatgrass so they're being starved of what they thrive on or being killed off by the change in PH in your digestive tracts.   Gut flora or microbiome research is absolutely fascinating at the moment. It's well worth a look!   I wonder if this is what causes all those 'detox' ill feelings. Changes to gut flora from unfamiliar foods and diet. :D"

There are thousands of heavy metals and other compounds in the world today that your kidneys and liver can't process, these usually get deposited in your fatty tissues, such as the brain.  An example: organic mercury has a half life in the body of about a year, methylmercury from seafood has a half-life of around 30 days I believe.  There are also compounds that chelate heavy metals such as cilantro and chlorella.  Chlorophyll itself is known to be a good chelator so cruciferous vegetables are definitely a good choice.  Scientific study on compounds that can remove other synthetic toxicants such as PCBs which may never leave your body is very scarce so accounts are mainly anecdotal at this point.  Don't let these uninformed people fool you, the liver and kidneys are amazing organs, but they are far from perfect when dealing with the massive influx of compounds our bodies have never had to deal with over millions of years of evolution.

The Guardian : References a number of studies and inputs from Phd holding people in the health/nutrition field Non-profit organization with input from database of over 6,000 scientists, from Nobel prize winners to postdocs and PhD students However, there's little evidence that detox diets actually remove toxins from the body. Indeed, the kidneys and liver are generally quite effective at filtering and eliminating most ingested toxins. -MAYO CLINIC Your body is an expert at getting rid of toxins no matter what you eat.

(I went to electrolytes first, though, because I find then when I feel nauseous, even if it's not directly caused by a lack of electrolytes, getting some sodium/potassium/magnesium often helps me). You will start to feel better over time, though. You need to get used to it psychologically, and it also takes time for your digestive system to adjust.

In the meantime, it might not hurt you to drink either small Gatorade or a light one just to keep yourself up for a while.  The light one has very little sugar.  What I like to do is water it down so that I get the flavor and the other stuff without it being so sweet.  If you're still feeling sick after 2 weeks, you might talk to a doctor."

nutrition,35w3pd,JollyGreenJeff,1 point,Thu May 14 12:17:55 2015 UTC,"I wanted to make sure you knew I wasn't suggesting that.    The thing with alcohol, is it's a bit like having candy every night after dinner.  Your body gets used to wanting sweetness.  I think that could be tying into your other cravings, just like smokers will crave sweets too when they can't replace it with a smoke.  Your body is just used to having a ""treat"" and it wants some sort of ""treat"" be it alcohol, smokes, sugar, fat, and so on.  It's difficult to get the cravings to move over to something else.  The lucky ones get their cravings moved over to exercise, so now their ""treat"" is something healthy.     The same thing will sometimes happen with internet and reddit.  It's brain candy.  No one's brain wants to give up brain candy, so it can be hard to moderate.  The only things that get me out of brain candy mode are exercise related, but even then, I can only do exercise that entertains me."

I suspect, without proof, that eating excessive carbs prior to my diagnosis was a possible trigger activating my latent or genetic tendency towards type 2.

I also add a cup of unsweetened almond milk, a half cup of oats and a banana. Sometimes I add apple slices, sometimes I add berries. I also have a vegan supplimental powder that adds a cinnamon flavor to it.  You are on the right track! Natural sugar always beats processed sugar.

Here's an article on fresh vs. frozen strawberries: http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/fresh-fruit-versus-frozen-fruit-which-is-better/  Anyways, as for fruit (whether it's frozen or fresh) they both have the same benefits. This is stated in the article above. As for your sugar intake, fruits contain a natural sugar called fructose, which is glucose plus sucrose. When a sugar is natural it is easier for your body to break down and use to make energy (because glucose is what powers your bodies tissues by providing energy, or ATP).  I took the time to input the ingredients of your smoothie into my diet analysis plus program (which is the program that my college has nutrition majors use). My program estimated the smoothie to be about 450 calories with frozen thawed sweetened (I'm not sure if you use sweetened or unsweetened) strawberries, canned mango nectar, bananas and kiwis. Keep in mind that I do not have he serving sizes you use, so I just added a serving of each to the smoothie. 450 calories is not a lot from a smoothie, in fact this is a good amount because you are not only meeting your fruit intake for the day, but a large portion of your daily calories should come from breakfast. Since you've met your recommended fruit intake through breakfast I do not recommend eating anymore fruits throughout the day, so stick to vegetables with your other meals. Otherwise, I feel you are doing a fine job eating a healthy breakfast.   I hope that this information I have provided is helpful. -Fellow Nutrition Student Ally"

nutrition,35pekv,mcgruntman,4,Wed May 13 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"Hello. You are entitled to your own opinion, and I respect that; however, fructose is what gives fruit its natural sweetness once the fruit is ripe. Here is a quote from an article I found to back this up, ""fructose occurs naturally, for example, in fruits, vegetables and their juices and honey.""   Here's the link to the article with that information: http://www.fructose.org/pdf/ADAFructosefactsheetfinal.pdf  Now about HFCS, it is a man made chemically engineered sweetener. The article I've added below provides reasoning as to why HFCS is a man made product. It also states that sucrose used to be the source of what made beverages like soft drinks (sodas for example) sweet, but now HFCS is used because it is sweeter and cheaper to, ""make,"" meaning HFCS is a man made sweetener. Moreover, since fructose (specifically, HFCS) is sweeter than sucrose less of it is needed to achieve the same sweetness.  To back my statement up: https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/how-high-fructose-corn-syrup-damages-your-body   This article also stated, ""eating small amounts of whole fruit will not provide tremendous amounts of fructose and should not be a problem for most people, unless diabetes or obesity is an issue but fruit juices, sodas and other beverages sweetened with fructose should be avoided.""  Additionally, this person my advice was directed toward had originally asked whether consuming these fruits is bad for their diet. I provided reasoning as to why I believe that consuming these fruits through a smoothie is not bad for this persons diet.   Like I said, you are entitled to your own opinion, but would you rather meet your recommended sugar intake through added sugars like HFCS or through fructose, which is naturally present in ripe fruits? Fructose is also a simple sugar found in fruits versus HFCS, which is an added sugar.   Again, I'm providing a source for back-up: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/organic/sugar.html  Fructose may be shown as a contributor to fatty liver disease, but in small amounts fructose is not an issue as stated previously. If someone (e.g. a client of mine if I was to become a clinical nutritionist) had fatty liver disease, then obviously I would not recommend they consume fruits regularly. When someone has a disease then obviously the advice given by the nutritionist/dietitian changes.     Again, you are entitled to your own opinion, but I would like to point out I see no back-up to your statement and is it really necessary to come at me like that? I also do not see that you are a dietitian or nutrition science student? Next time can you please just down vote my advice and move on? Please and thank you... especially because I do not appreciate negativity in general seeing as i'm an optimist not a pessimist."
nutrition,35pekv,Oh_LovelyAllison,1 point,Tue May 12 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"You would prefer that I down vote than that I dispute in a comment? I find that a strange attitude.  You're right I should provide sources, I will endeavour to do so later when I have more time.  I find your opposition to hfcs and simultaneous endorsement of fructose confusing. It's the same thing! That's not to say that fruits are unhealthy as a rule, but just that I don't think 'fructose is a healthy sugar' is a valid claim. And as a scientist you should be able to see that natural vs artificial is a meaningless divide in this context."
nutrition,35pekv,BrotherBringTheSun,2,Tue May 12 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"I have not once stated that in my previous comments that fructose is quote, ""a healthy sugar."" There is no such thing as a, ""healthy sugar."" Fruits have fructose, which is what gives them their natural sweetness. Fructose is a simple sugar that occurs naturally in fruits. High fructose corn syrup, is for the second time, a man made chemically engineered sugar. HFCS is an added sugar to things like soft drinks (e.g. soda and even hot dogs). You will not find HFCS in fruits, period. Moreover, consuming the recommended amount of fruits daily provides an insignificant amount of fructose, or sugar to a persons daily recommended sugar intake. However, added sugars are the number one source of sugar for many, and one can of soda, specifically coca-cola has 39grams of sugar (which, includes both regular sugar and HFCS) making it already over the recommended 37.5g sugar intake for men and the 25g recommended intake for women. In rebuttle to that the smoothie from the original thread provides about 22g of sugar, which is less than the recommended for both men and women. However, that is why I pointed out that said person should not have anymore fruits for they day BECAUSE they met their intake for sugar and fruits during breakfast. This was found out using my diet analysis program. I'd also like to point out that HFCS is only in processed fruits AND processed fruits are a different topic all together.  I would also like to point out that I've taken both intro to food science and advanced food science and both micro and macronutrients. I'm not sure what you've been to school for, but I know the scientific aspect to these foods. You're trying to disapprove what I've said.  All I have to say is that I don't pay 13,000 to 15,000 per semester to learn what you called at the beginning BS.

nutrition,35pekv,PoppaDR3W,1 point,Tue May 12 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"Fructose from corn syrup and fructose in whole fruit may be molecularly the same but the way they are metabolized in the body is very different since the fructose in whole fruit is packaged with fiber/water/vitamins/minerals/phytonutrients. This isn't trivial. It's a BIG difference. So much so that eating fruit, lots of fruit, actually can help prevent and reverse the same diseases that eating HFCS causes."

nutrition,35pekv,blonderson,2,Tue May 12 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"Chemically both forms of fructose are the same. HFCS has a mix of fructose and glucose (where regular corn syrup would have just glucose), similar to honey. HFCS is made by adding an isomerase enzyme to corn syrup, changing some of the glucose into fructose. Bees make honey by adding invertase (among other enzymes) to sucrose, breaking it down into glucose and fructose.   The main issue with HFCS is its concentration; it can deliver a lot more sugar per serving or by weight, plus it's often used in foods that don't have the fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients that whole fruits have. On a chemical level the sugars in fruit/honey/HFCS are the same, it's the amount that's so different. Then there's the issue of the industry behind it, but that's another story.  So yes, whole fruit is better than food with added sugars, but for different reasons than most people think."

As for the smoothies... those are a good option to ease into solids again because it won't wreak havoc on your GI tract. Supplementing with some unsaturated fats (avocodo, nuts, or a fish oil supplement for smoothies), as well as a bit of protein powder is good (Whole Foods has a good, but pricey, plant protein). Make sure you're also getting enough fiber when making the smoothies because it'll help balance the amount of sugar you may be consuming through the liquids (I don't know if they're juices or what?)."

Bottom line you need to expend more calories than you consume to lose weight. There are things you can do to get the most out of your healthy diet and exercise.  Here are some tips: 1) try to eat around 5 small meals each day with lean protein in each. DO NOT skip breakfast. Having a protein packed breakfast is important for weight loss. 2) choose whole grains over refined/processed grains. Whole grain have more nutrients and fiber helping you feel full longer. 3) avoid saturated and trans fats. Go more towards mono and poly unsaturated fats. 4) eat plenty of Fruits and veggies. These also keep you feeling full and are nutrient dense. 5) add resistance exercise to build muscle.  With these simple concepts you can create a variety of meals that are sustainable and allow you to lose weight and gain muscle. I also recommend using the Myfitnesspal app to keep track of you calorie intake each day. I hope that was helpful! Don't hesitate to ask any other questions.

In order to retain as much muscle as possible during weight loss it is better for the body to have a more constant source of protein.

A fair amount of research suggests glycine has health benefits (1). However, collagen is an incomplete protein source since it is bereft of many of the important amino acids normally derived from eating protein.  So think of collagen protein something to have in addition to your other protein sources, not as a replacement for them. And in this case I think it could carry unique benefits.   http://valtsus.blogspot.com/2013/12/glycine.html"

For example, if I eat oatmeal with seeds and nuts and apples, I feel good but after eating the greens I feel the contents of my stomach don't sit as well. Idk if that makes sense but I feel better not eating vegetables, aside from the mental idea that I should be eating them to be healthy, you know?

I would start cutting sugary drinks with the seltzers, increasing the amount of seltzer every week or so. The plain seltzer was for Coke or root beer.  But I would pair orange seltzer with orange soda so the flavor boost was there while the corn syrup was getting cut.  After about a month, the seltzer tasted enough like soda that I didn't even need to buy both (and frankly I don't really miss Coke though I do miss root beer).    Now, any soda, soft drink, etc tastes like corn syrup and it's horribly slimy and sickly sweet. Better still, taking out the soft drink makes other sweet foods taste sweeter for me. I haven't been able to eat most candies (over-sweet) and any chocolate I eat is dark chocolate or even just cocoa powder. Also, natural sugary foods (like fruits and some vegetables) taste sweeter as a result. You'd be surprised by how ""sweet"" water can taste, especially with its ice cold.  For me, I found that taking out sodas will start a chain reaction."

I generally wouldn't refuse sugary foods offered by other people (because hey, free food, and I was never overweight) but as time went on my desire for them most certainly diminished.

nutrition,35kv76,rucheleh06,2,Tue May 12 05:06:09 2015 UTC,"Spirulina - 60% protein, natural (grow it, dry it, grind it, thats all)  However its' extremely expensive as a protein source, its best thought of as a nutrition supplement.  the hype is, it could be grown where conventional plants can't , being part of a post fossil-fuel age solution to feeding billions,I don't see why it couldn't be cheaper in future, however that does not appear to translate into it being economical today.  it also looks, smells, and tastes like pond scum, because it IS essentially pondscum.  I'm finding myself able to get through 10gramms per day , but as a significant protein source you'd be talking more like 50 gramms per day, yikes.  Other than that - from looking into reducing my meat intake economically, it seemed like Skimmed-Milk was the best bet, however its mostly carbohydrate. c:p:f= 59:41:0.  playing with some numbers,   100ml skim-milk, 6g spirulina: c:p:f= 44:52:3 , but check the price.. and its sugars not complex-carbs. 100ml skim-milk+3g nuts: c:p:f=42:33:25 300ml skim-milk+5g spirulina + 60g oats: 334 kcal c:p:f=62:24:13 << i'm perfectly happy with this ratio for breakfast   My interest in high-protein is primarily satiating effect. I find its' far easer to control calorie intake and keep fat off eating lots of lean meat however I know this is completely unsustainable, and whilst not fanatical about it the 'animal cruelty' thing does begin to register.  So far, to my knowledge, the best I can do is currently is protein powder (whey & casein), its' processed so doesn't fit your criteria but I view it as 'anti-junkfood' , its like chunks of my life had been wasted consuming too much fat+sugar, so this processing to consume 'more protein' kind of offsets it.  I used to reduce fruit - not satiating - and protein powder - liquid calories, I feared that would not be satiating - but discovered blending them DOES gives you something satiating and nutritious. I've subsequently seen studies that say water trapped in blended food pads the food out, fills the stomach more, tricks it into thinking you've had more food, and indeed it seems to be widely known that protein is itself more satiating than the other macronutrients."
nutrition,35kv76,rucheleh06,1 point,Mon May 11 13:50:14 2015 UTC,"I also suggest spirulina, but I have two points of disagreement with the above characterization.     grow it, dry it, grind it, thats all   You can buy the dry form.  The live form is more nutritious but generally not sold because it is difficult to preserve.  You can grow it at home however, and it is fairly easy to do.  The great think about spirulina is that it is native to highly alkaline lakes where hardly anything else can live.  This means you can grow it in a fish tank and dump in a bunch of baking soda so that the pH gets so high other microbes can't survive.  You can throw it in a smoothie or on a salad.   it also looks, smells, and tastes like pond scum, because it IS essentially pondscum.   This is true, but pond scum is just a way of saying 'algae', albeit with a negative connotation.  I think it tastes fine.  It definitely tastes 'green', since it has a lot of chlorophyl.  I would describe the flavor as reminiscent of sea weed, but without the salty oceany flavor.  It also reminds me of the flavor of hemp, so if you had help oil or hemp hearts before, it is a good frame of reference."

I guess I might be over the point where I fear the green colour itself. I'm still a spirulina 'n00b' myself, only just recently tried it (but read about it ages ago)  I would be curious about self-growing, if maybe one is only using it as a supplement wanting 5-10g a day maybe you can get enough sunlight in an urban flat? I am kind of worried about poisoning myself if I try to grow anything. i'm quite clumsy etc.  I think i would be curious to try consuming larger amounts e.g. 20g, 40g.. but right now I'm perfectly happy to use processed protein powder.

nutrition,35kv76,rucheleh06,2,Mon May 11 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"So I'll tell you a story.  A buddy of mine and I a while ago wanted to grow bioluminescent algae and sell it to science labs.  It was a nightmare, because samples would get contaminated and get super disgusting.  Later we switched to spirulina, which although it doesn't glow in the dark, has this remarkable feature of being an extremophile -- it thrives in environments that most things can't live in, namely highly alkaline environments.  This means you can grow it at home safely without worrying about contamination, so long as you care for it. We don't sell it any more, but learned a lot.   The key active ingredient is C-Phycocyanin.  You can read about its benefits on Examine. I honestly don't know if drying the stuff out makes the phycocyanin more or less available.  However, I found a paper (pdf) that describes a process for extracting it from dry spirulina, which implies it is present in dry form.  I also found an Amazon supplement for phycocyanin itself, but beware, you can never be sure about supplements in the US.    Anyway, OP is interested in protein.

And the link is from 2007, before the EU revoked that study and now conclude that aspartame is perfectly safe in 2013.  Benefits are it makes things sweeter without needing to use sugar and doesn't have the normal effects that sugar does. It's also so damn sweet that you only need a REALLY small amount to sweeten something versus sugar.  As for any specific health benefits? Not really. It's a flavoring compound. Kind of like asking if rosemary or cumin have any specific health benefits when added to foods as a spice. Its largely irrelevant.   The safety of aspartame has been studied extensively since its discovery with research that includes animal studies, clinical and epidemiological research, and postmarketing surveillance.[38] Aspartame is one of the most rigorously tested food ingredients.[39] Peer-reviewed comprehensive review articles and independent reviews by governmental regulatory bodies have analyzed the published research on the safety of aspartame and have found aspartame is safe for consumption at current levels.[8][38][40][41] Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries,[41] including the UK Food Standards Agency,[42] the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)[43] and Health Canada.[44]"

The types of cells found in the hypodermis are fibroblasts, adipose cells, and macrophages. The hypodermis is derived from the mesoderm, but unlike the dermis, it is not derived from the dermatome region of the mesoderm. In arthropods, the hypodermis is an epidermal layer of cells that secretes the chitinous cuticle. The term also refers to a layer of cells lying immediately below the epidermis of plants.

Honestly, though, the number doesn't matter much. What matters is having healthy habits and being happy with how you look ing the mirror.  For what it's worth, just estimating from your pic, I'd say you're in the 15-18% range right now. I could tell better with pics in more neutral lighting, front and side views, and flexed v. unflexed.  If you want to drop bodyfat, it's almost entirely diet. Doing HIIT is great for you, but it won't outpace a caloric surplus, because it will make you hungrier faster than it will burn calories. From where you are now, if you want to drop much lower, you're probably going to need to count calories and really work on your diet. I do it and it's really not that hard after the first few weeks.

Dietary cholesterol does not become blood cholesterol, our bodies already produce all the cholesterol they need, so adding or lowering cholesterol consumption wont do much to change that. The only thing that changes cholesterol levels is fat consumption, particularly saturated fat, and it doesnât change it in a good way.   Similar to coconut oil, olive oil is empty calories.

I wouldn't say I'm on the low-carb style (due to my love for fruits) but I'm naturally not that attracted to starchy foods (other than boiled potatoes) and beans.

I really hope veganism works out for you and you find what you need. And I agree about that keto/paleo thing, if you can get the same results with either, paleo will probably give you a broader spectrum of nutrition than keto.

It's easy to measure blood pressure once you've bought a home blood pressure monitor, so it would be nice to know if you could use these readings instead/as well - I've been varying my diet very slightly to see what happens with my blood pressure but haven't got anything statistically significant yet.  2) I wouldn't want to encourage you to do anything you think might impair your health, but I would be very interested to know if adding carbs in the form of starches (e.g. pasta, rice, or potatoes), not sugar, would give decent scores. There have been studies claiming that the problem with the modern diet is specifically fructose, or fructose via sucrose. Starches like pasta might then be OK, which would lead to a less extreme diet, and might be easily metabolized to fuel exercise - taken to extremes, this is carbo-loading, of course. OTOH there are also people rubbishing the increasing suspicion of fructose.  3) I personally wouldn't go to the extremes you have - in particular stopping exercise for months risks injury when you restart - even just by lowering skill levels."

Low(ish) carb, high fat diets are superior for weight loss despite the caloric excess and lack of exercise. Cutting meat does not improve lipids.   Somewhat surprises me:   The pronounced effect of protein on blood sugar. The large effect of (lack of) exercise on HDL: The low(ish) carb, high fat diet should have the best HDL, especially considering the fat loss.   Bothers me a bit:   Different exercises during the diets. I know I can not expect you to keep everything else constant, but still. The macros of the low(ish) carb, high fat diet could have a better carb:fat ratio. That 29% carbs is without fiber, right? No information on blood pressure, LDL, VLDL, energy levels, muscle mass and strength, cognitive effects.     Could you investigate the ketogenic diet as well?   <20g net (non-fiber) carbohydrates. Adequate protein: At most 0.8 g/kg for sedentary people, 1.4 g/kg for endurance athletes, 1.8 g/kg for strength athletes. This is a maximum, above this there are no additional advantages in terms of muscle protein synthesis. It is advisable to keep this high enough to allow for appropriate muscle development but low enough to make room for fat calories. The rest of the calories coming from fat. Preferably more than 70% should come from fat to maintain ketosis. Example macronutrient breakdown assuming a 80kg person, 2000 calories, and 1.4 g/kg protein: 4c/22p/74f.

nutrition,35hmyx,vkailas,2,Thu May 14 01:23:21 2015 UTC,"raykuy, i liked the article but i think the problem of obesity epidemic is largely cultural and educational. It's still very common to people to blame current obesity on the sedentary life styles when that's just a one contributing factor (people were sedentary and had diabetes before but they didn't have obese babies / kids and there were actually advertisements for woman to gain weight). Moreover, basic nutrition and cooking is a mystery to most americans. They think margarine is more healthy than butter (it isn't), they have no idea how much sugar is hidden in processed foods as a preservative to extend shelf life (a lot and in everything), they think eating any fat / cholesterol will make you fat (it clearly doesn't as tons of other countries eat lots of good fats and stay fit and skinny e.g. indians eating ghee or argentines eating fatty steak) so most americans choose non-fat/ diet /processed options, they think cow milk is good for your bones (it isn't when you are an adult). Plus, cooking isn't passed on from parents to kids as more and more people rely on fast food, frozen meals, and delivery .    This isn't going to change easily because american are very defensive of their foods and eating habits, companies have financial incentives to keep things they way they are,  and the US govn't works with the companies / farmers to help them sell more (e.g. FDA pushing cheese sales).

Based on what you are eating you are probably in pretty good shape but might have several micros that are still out of wack.  For instance I had a lot of trouble getting enough Potassium.

As for a meal plan, this is just something you will have to determine on your own.  Sounds like you're on the right track and are providing the bulk of your food intake around whole and or minimally processed foods.  Until you know for sure, your attempt at a healthy diet may be somewhat misguided in that you are devoid of various macro and micro nutrients.  Life threatening?  Most likely not. But then we might want to understand - even at a basic level - what roles those various nutrients play in the body and how easily it is to include some natural sources in the diet.  Frozen spinach, canned tomatoes, etc  Sufficient calories and the meeting of your macro nutrient targets at the end of the day should be the main focus.  Quality of food sources, from protein to fat to carbohydrate is secondary.  Exercise in some fashion is only going to help your body in numerous ways, as well as how it receives said nutrients.  Diet and lifestyle go hand in hand..  The diet you settle into is formed over the course of time with regards to what you enjoy eating, how you enjoy eating it, when you enjoy eating that stuff and so on."

nutrition,35je42,Dvdfl,2,Sun May 10 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"Jennifer Novakovich wrote a blog post about this very issue for athletes :   Although vegetable based protein supplements may be a healthier option for athletes, they are deficient in a few things that would be beneficial to athletes.   Heme iron for example is not present in vegetables, although non-heme iron is. Non-heme iron is not as bioavailable as heme iron and, since athletes require more oxygen delivery to their active muscles, non-heme iron may not be sufficient enough to sustain a healthy iron status.   Iron deficiency anemia is a common problem, as well as anemia due to vitamin b12 (which is also only present in animals), in vegetarian and vegan athletes.   Creatine is also lacking in vegetables, which is important in power during performance.   With all of that said, the above can be supplemented into vegan athletesâ diets which will provide ample amounts of the above nutrients.   Also, omnivore athletes will have these nutrients in their diets through other sources and therefore they wouldnât be an important factor in which protein supplement is better for them  http://www.jennovafoodblog.com/?p=38"

I'm afraid my info is somewhat anecdotal because of that, but I'll pass it along (even though I imagine I'll get down voted for this).  Protein powder is a processed food so I'd be discouraged from using it other than as a supplement once a day (and not a giant dose, maybe 15g).  When you eat a steak, it takes hours to digest and extract nutrients from it.  Protein powder gets absorbed much quicker and larger amounts hit the liver and kidneys at once, which might be a problem if done over a prolonged period of time.  Uric acid builds up in your body as a result of all that nitrogen being passed through the liver and kidney so quickly1. At one point my liver scores shot way up and my doctor told me stop taking protein powder. Shortly after I stopped, my numbers went back to normal.  In my experience, bad liver scores are common in BB.  Also, because it's a processed powder, you don't know exactly what's in them2.  Meat has b12 which you need, fish meat has good omega 3's, and both have Iron as well.  Meat is more than just protein.  My opinion is that meat, eggs, dairy are better than powders.

Also, if you have any food restrictions (like vegetarians / vegans and all the variations) than you must consider what vitamins and minerals are in the food that you avoid.

Now, the other thing I have heard is that most first world nations are deficient in vitamin D3, so that is one that I would recommend supplementing on top of the multivitamin. Also, a fish oil pill containing around 1g of combined EPA+DHA is a good thing to be taking once or twice per day if you don't eat much fish.  Other than those, there is no need to be taking a bunch of supplements.  If you are eating a balanced healthy diet, you are probably not deficient in anything. Adequate levels of Vitamin D3 are produced by full-body skin exposure to direct sunlight for at least 15 mins per day which most people do not get these days which is why it is an exception."

You're going to gain just about an equal amount of weight if you eat 3500 extra calories in one day compared to over a couple of days.

Maybe a day later after the food cycles through one of you may have gained a pound, one of you may have lost a pound if you lost any water weight by sweating or the like, it really also depends on base metabolism and what sort of body you each have, and your activity level and probably even the types of foods you age could factor heavily into that.  The short answer is maybe yes, maybe no. It's a very iffy answer because weight naturally fluctuates.  For me I started losing weight easier lately because my thyroid is no longer royally fucked. Turns out I wasn't getting enough iodine so I had a metabolism problem as well as an issue with a number of other vitamins.

I just kind of shocked myself coming up with the idea refined sugar might actually have a valid use, after being sugar-phobic for so long. Going from 0% refined sugar to 1%, to get a big dose of spirulina in whilst still enjoying the other 98% healthy calories sounds like it might be a worthwhile tradeoff.  its' not so much 'what people will think of taking the pills' .. its' what I'm going to stick to.

nutrition,35bykr,Brutish,2,Sat May 9 01:12:26 2015 UTC,"There is a problem with inorganic arsenic found in rice. Inorganic arsenic iAs is more toxic than organic arsenic.  Arsenic is a metalloid that occurs in different inorganic and organic forms, which are found in the environment both from natural occurrence and from anthropogenic activity.  The inorganic forms of arsenic are more toxic as compared to the organic arsenic but so far most of the occurrence data in food collected in the framework of official food control are still reported as total arsenic without differentiating the various arsenic species.  http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1351.htm   Also on EFSA:   Except for âRiceâ, presenting a relatively high level of iAs, the contribution to the dietary exposure of iAs from the other main food groups was mainly due to their relatively high consumption levels. In particular âGrain-based processed products (non rice-based)â made a large contribution to the overall exposure to iAs. In almost all dietary surveys and age classes in the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, wheat bread and rolls were the most dominant contributor to iAs exposure within âGrain-based processed products (non rice-based)  http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3597.htm   An article (abstract):    Rice has been found to contain a high amount of inorganic arsenic (iAs) that the plant accumulates from soil.

I would eat very little during the day and then at night I could consume anywhere up to 2200 on a bad day calories, mostly of shit food. Over the last 6 months I've learned to get over it. I lost 20 pounds in 7 weeks after I've got over this habit.   Simply put, start eating healthier. I don't care what people on this sub will tell you- pretty much nothing at Ihop is good for you and you need to educate yourself on why this may be true. All the books I've read on food came down to the same conclusion: Eat More fruits and vegetables- it needs be what most of your meals are centered on. I learned you need to make eating fiber a priority so that you feel fuller from the volume you consume. I'm pretty sure I would get the night time uncontrollability from eating no fiber as my body relied on my blood sugar level as an indicator of being full.

This also allows me to keep track of exactly what I'm eating, because obviously, I can only eat what I bring. When I'm at home however, I struggle to keep track and often eat more calories than I should. BUT, I do still eat healthy.  What I recommend is, ask for a corner or shelf in the fridge and a spot in a cabinet. Do your own healthy shopping and seperate your healthy food from the unhealthy food. Also, make a rule for your self. If it is not on ""your"" shelf, or in ""your"" cabinet, don't eat it. The longer you follow this rule, the easier it becomes to continue to follow it.

nutrition,359tx1,lovechip,8,Sat May 9 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"So there are a few things that might be going on here.   Are you hungry when you get home? Do you deal with quite a lot of stress during the day? Or feel a sense of having to be very controlled during the day?  It's worth noting this isn't your fault. It's nothing to do with being weak or lacking willpower. It'll be more to do with how your lifestyle is set up. Currently something/s are not optimised for you to be able to still care when you get home. Think of it as a puzzle to be tweaked and solved. You might not come up with a perfect solution, but you might be able to improve it enough for it to help you on your way with your goals.   Could part of the issue be black and white thinking? By which I mean, you eat healthy during the day and feel really determined to lose weight and in your head the alternative to being determined and eating really well, is eating really badly, massively overeating and totally giving up? If so, it might be good to find compromises and let go of those two extremes a bit. Finding yourself a sustainable middle ground will make weight loss a more relaxed and enjoyable process.  So, for example, rather than expecting yourself to eat a really healthy dinner, maybe you will eat pizza and some ice cream for dinner, but maybe just tweak the portions a bit. You could technically lose weight eating chocolate and pizza every day, if you ate the right amounts. Maybe you need to slow down on the weight loss, increase your daily allowance to make it easier to do consistently, but just lose weight slower.   The other thing is to check if you feel you're straying into binge eating behaviour. This would normally occur when you 'diet' or restrict yourself quite deliberately and have a voice in your head that rules out certain foods. For most people this just causes a backlash where you cannot sustain that denial and then drop everything and just have to switch off from the weight loss mindset to give your brain a break from trying to hold everything together so tightly.  If this is an issue for you, then the changes need to start with relaxing about the process, being more flexible, slowing down the pace of change, don't keep things off limits.   I'd really recommend these two tedx talks that might help give you strategies for tackling this: 1. tiny habit changes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8 2. behavioural change that leads to weight loss as a side effect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWfqBy4sSD8  Don't aim for perfect with your diet. Drop any aim to become perfectly healthy, fit, slim, etc and give yourself a break. Then you'll be able to learn how to enjoy the process rather than just the end result."
nutrition,359tx1,lovechip,2,Fri May 8 09:56:06 2015 UTC,"I know that I'm not really binging because I keep a diet tracker and it keeps me on a 2,038 calorie day diet, which I find to be completely reasonable. I eat a 600 calorie breakfast and an 700-800 calorie lunch which leaves me with over 700 left normally at the end of the day. A lot of times I'll make my healthy 400 calorie dinner which is usually chicken, carrot and asparagus sauteed in olive oil which I love.  But a few hours roll by and it's usually past midnight and I go into crave.  I usually allow myself a few snacks or sometimes I'll eat a bigger dinner but the end result is always the same. I overeat and eat shit. It's like this thing I can't control my mindset changes and I begin to not care whether I'm on budget for calories and a lot of times I'll go a thousand over what I'm supposed to!"
nutrition,359tx1,lovechip,2,Fri May 8 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"I really understand that mindset. One thing that stood out here is that you're going to bed after midnight. How much sleep do you get per night? What hours do you usually sleep between?  It could be that you're underestimating the important role sleep plays in managing weight. When I trained as a PT, the tutors told us that sleep is as important as exercise and diet. Without enough sleep at the right times, it can affect hormones including hunger and satiety hormones as well as stress hormones. Plus the later you stay up, the longer you'll have gone since dinner, which means you probably would be ready for another meal. However, if you get to bed even by 11.30, you may be able to curb some of this."
nutrition,359tx1,seebreezy,2,Sat May 9 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"I definitely am underestimating how much sleep goes into it. But honestly you could apply this to my sleep schedule as well.  I generally get 7-10 hours of sleep, some nights I may dip down below 7 but it's rare.   It's not very consistent is the problem, but part of it is my work schedule. I generally work till late sometimes even 2 am on weekends.   Very good point about the longer I stay up past dinner though. It's weird I'll wake up and feel hungry but not feel the temptation to really indulge. When I get hungry at night is a completely different story.   The hours I'd say I sleep between the most would be from 3 am to noon. 99% that's when I go to bed and when I wake up."
nutrition,359tx1,jcwhite352,1 point,Sat May 9 21:35:29 2015 UTC,"So sleep could be an area to work on, slowly and a side effect might be greater control over the binges.  Also, it's no surprise you have this at night rather than in the day. You've spent all day doing things, using up self control and willpower and it's depleted by the end of the day. I really think your best targets for getting on top of this are good quality sleep, stress management throughout the day, cutting out any extraneous responsibilities/duties that take up energy and that will leave a bit more left over at the end of the day.  But also, sometimes it's just the environment and if you get everything else quite sorted but this habit still won't budge, you may just have to hang on until a time when, maybe you have your own place and have control over what stuff comes in the house. We all have our limits and sometimes we go through periods where we don't have full control of our environment, stress levels, etc and during these times it's sometimes better to just give ourselves a break until the situation changes. :)"

I reached my limit so many times, but the crappy situation doesn't go away just because you've reached your limit. Eventually it does start to point you towards better things.

nutrition,359tx1,crazymusicman,2,Fri May 8 18:52:11 2015 UTC,"I experienced this for many months until I made a simple habit change. Which I will explain. But first understand something:   Don't expect yourself to make healthy eating choices when you're very tired at the end of a day. With temptations all around. You cant; your willpower is depleted. Instead, plan your next day's meal ahead the day before.    I use MyFitnessPal and each day I enter tomorrow's breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in. It then takes almost zero willpower to eat my plan because everything is already decided.   And while you might not get Grandma to change her food buying, perhaps you can agree to put the candy in the breadbox? Out of sight, out of temptation."
nutrition,35b62y,_sushiprincess,8,Fri May 8 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"This is probably not what you want to hear, but lifestyle changes like these can't really be forced on people. These changes have to be things that your brother actually wants to accomplish. Like you said, trying to guilt him or pressure him in other ways will either hurt his feelings or result in him trying to manipulate you/your mother.  It sounds to me like you were spot on with your assumption that he is struggling with depression. IANA psychologist however so there's not a whole lot of useful advice I can give. What I am fairly certain of though, is that his dietary issues should take a back seat to potential mental health issues/depression. I would seek counseling from a professional for him, and once that is established, take small steps toward correcting his poor diet/lifestyle.  As a final thought, try to find some sort of physical activity he's willing to engage in. Exercise is a crucial part of any healthy lifestyle and there is evidence to suggest that being physically active helps to combat depression. Not to mention, it will help him become fit should he stick to it or branch out into other forms of exercise."

But we don't want to wait until that happens.   And it upsets me that he's making such manipulative comments to my mom. He hasn't exhibited signs of depression since HS and he has been through therapy. All this happening really took an emotional and physical toll on my mom, which is why she's so affected by these comments. A lot has changed positively about his personality and he has told me that he's feeling a lot better, which makes me think that the comments he makes are just a tool of manipulation. Of course, he could really be feeling these things and I just don't know. I want to be sensitive to his feelings but I'm frustrated that he doesn't care about his health."

For onions, heat can kill beneficial organosulfides. For cruciferous vegetables heat helps and hurts. Heat can kill the beneficial enzyme myrosinase, but makes other nutrients more bioavailable. So for cruciferous vegetables it's good to have them in a soup and salad. Chew raw cruciferous vegetables well. It releases the myrosinase from the cell membrane where it mixes with glucosinolates in the cell to form isothiocyanates (ITCs). ITCs are supposed to have cancer-fighting properties."

In my opinion increasing omega-3 intake alone will produce at least the same benefits on heart disease risk. Unfortunately there isn't strong evidence for this yet, but I believe it's consistent with the existing clinical trials published on the subject.

Carbohydrates are everywhere in our modern diet, but are not really necessary in the amounts we are used to consuming.

nutrition,35aiul,AlpineSummit,4,Fri May 8 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"Breakfast: Cheerios or any other generic supermarket cereal is a big no in my book. They have added sugar and little substance. The egg with sourdough is much better. I would drop the jam - sugar for breakfast just makes you hungry mid-morning (in my experience). Oatmeal would be better than cereal, with nuts and cinnamon (for example) or fruit (which has sugar, granted, but also has fibre).  Lunch: Soup seems fine. Could you swap the baguette (which I assume is white and refined - more sugar!) for wholegrain bread or a salad with veggies?  Dinner: White refined pasta - not great to eat everyday. I made the switch to wholegrain and don't miss the regular kind at all - that could be an option. But switch it up with more protein-based dinners - your diet is pretty carby.  I have pizza once a week too (so good!), but have you tried making your own? It's pretty easy, you can make batches of dough and sauce and freeze for convenience - just defrost, roll out, assemble and bake. I use half and half white and wholegrain flour for the base and pile it with veggies.  Overall verdict: decrease sugar, reduce carby dinners, and try tracking your calories on MFP for a few weeks (don't go by the portion sizes on packets, weigh and track the amount you are actually eating)."
nutrition,35aiul,pigwhistler,2,Fri May 8 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is helpful, and confirms what I had thought. Is there any kind of oatmeal you'd recommend? I've only eaten the quaker instant oatmeal while on backpacking trips....and I bet that has tons of sugar in it.  The baguette is just refined white bread. Only kind they have and it comes with the soup....but I could probably ask to not have it, or get a tortilla and hummus. The dinner of pasta is mostly because my girlfriend has a very limited/plain diet for health reasons, and that's the only meal we get to eat together everyday due to schedules. But I should make an effort to switch things up for me.   And I love baking my own pizza! We used to do that a lot, but time just has gotten away from us."

nutrition,35agpt,turtleattacks,3,Fri May 8 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think you have a good base to eating healthy, but there are improvements that can be made.  First, I see no fruit.  I would add 1 piece or a cup at breakfast and another at a snack time or even lunch.  Second, you are adding a lot of oil to your meals which means a lot of fat.  The salad at lunch is great, but you could cut back on the amount of dressing, either put it on the side and dip each bite into it, or measure out 1 Tbsp.  For dinner instead of frying the tofu and meat you could sautee it in just 1 tsp of canola oil or even in some veggie broth. Also with dinner keep the rice to 1 cup and try brown rice.  I see that you want to gain weight and you can definitely add things to your meals. With breakfast add 2 eggs or yogurt or any type of protein that you like, it will help make you full and keep blood sugars from spiking. If you add the fruit this will instantly bulk up the meal in a healthy way.  With lunch you have protein and veggies, but you should add a carb.  You could again do a piece of fruit, or a small whole wheat bread roll or crackers, even a cup of noodle or bean soup.  Do you snack at all during the day? If you add 2 healthy snacks like a handful of nuts and fruit, veggies and hummus, or corn tortilla chips and salsa, even just a greek yogurt you will get more calories, but balance out your meals a little more.

The official WHO recommendation is 25g of added sugar.  I wouldn't worry too much about the lactose in the milk unless you're drinking half a gallon a day. The potassium is tricky since it's not required to be reported on labels.  Only two vitamins (A and C) and two minerals (calcium and iron) are required on the food label. So you're probably getting plenty of it without realizing.  Honestly, unless you're on diuretics, endurance athlete, or had problems with low potassium in the past, I wouldn't worry about it.   I can't help you with iron.  I take supplements for that.  The only way to lose weight and keep it off is to do it slowly.  Slow enough that your eating patterns change on a fundamental level.

I've never seen data on the nutritional content of preserved fruits, but I imagine the concentration of all the solids and sugars can't be equivalently healthy, and is to be regarded as a ""treat"" so I haven't been eating the raspberry jam we put aside last year.  I do eat oatmeal. Probably 3/4 times per week. The other days are usually eggs, but since we have less animal protein this year, I've been moving the eggs to lunch so we don't have beans twice a day. I did go out and buy a box of Raisin Bran when I first realized I wasn't getting enough fiber (before I went the supplement route) and found out it was a HUGE mistake. My daughter, who usually doesn't get that much added sugar FREAKED the H out when daddy gave her some, wanting more. After that box was gone, I switched to flavorless dextrin(?). She doesn't want anything to do with that.  We don't eat a lot of purchased breads, but I am going to start looking into ways I can add more fiber to the bread I make at home. It's difficult, though, finding the right formula, because too much filler makes it hard for the yeast to raise the loaf. And some of the seeds (flax/chia) I could use, in order to put in enough to make a difference in the fiber, the calories would go up by quite a bit.  Ok on the potassium. We eat so many whole foods, I figured the verified nutritional facts on MFP would automatically have the potassium on it. I was surprised, the first day I entered a banana in, that it barely made a dent in the overall potassium goal, but, like 20g of carrots is plenty of Vitamin A (that might be an overexaggeration). So, I'll assume that potassium is just not something there would be a lot of data on unless otherwise told by my medical professional. BTW, would that be why none of our vitamins have it in them? My prenatals and my regular, my husband's regular and the +50y/o men's he accidentally bought (lol) didn't have any potassium at all... most didn't even have it listed as an option.  Yeah, other hobbies is important. I stay home with the kids, so having access to all our food at all times was a big hurdle for me.

Several generations removed with some German thrown in, but we've kept the French cuisine. Also, we were farmers, historically, so my mom (and then me) grew up with butter in the frying pan before frying anything instead of oil, real cream in the coffee and buttermilk for the cereal/oatmeal. A plate of cheese at the end of every meal. A HUGE ASS glass of whole milk (2 cups, minimum) for every person at every meal. Real cream-and-yogurt-based dressings instead of low-fat or vineagrettes. The works.  Best part was for my mom, when we were on WIC, most dairy products were included so she didn't have to modify much of what she gave us from what she was given.   Modifying my dairy intake was a HUGE obstacle for me when I started to eat healthier. I cannot STAND skim milk and barely tolerate the 2% I buy as a concession to my calcium needs. I still use whole sour cream because I'd rather have the extra 20 cal/serving than eat low-or-nonfat. I've had to completely stop eating cottage cheese, and only eat cheese-cheese when I can actually taste it (no cheese on burgers, no cheese on tacos, but cheese plates are still good....mmmmmmm chevre.... <insert gargling noises here>) Butter I had to go cold-turkey because I'm like my mom... fry and egg--plop! a tablespoon of butter! make some toast--corner to corner, spread that butter until the whole thing glistens! eat a potato-- quick, someone give that spud CPR; it's having a heart attack! And since I don't like margerine (it tastes like it's trying too hard), I either it it with a ""healthy fat"" oil, like olive oil, or I go without.  I do use butter when I (rarely) bake, because it should literally be criminal for people to substitute margerine in cake and cookies. What's the point of eating junk food if you're going to sacrifice the taste to save yourself a few calories? Eat food that tastes amazing and enjoy the indulgence.

Also re: fiber powder, I don't know which kinds you're taking ""several times a day"" but a single tablespoon of psyllium powder has ~7g.

nutrition,357q40,FrigoCoder,1 point,Fri May 8 15:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think your problem is unique in that most people who are cutting still need way more than ~1000 kcals. When eating that little, it is EXTREMELY important to micromanage your diet so you don't end up with deficiencies (this was a major contributing factor to my mother developing osteoporosis early in her life, for example). Is it possible you're cutting too aggressively? Or maybe could you try picking up some more ""active"" hobbies, which would benefit you in more than one way? Right now, any single food is a huge contribution to your overall diet; for example, ~25% of all the food you eat is milk, and ~20% is rice.  You also don't eat many vegetables. If you insist on eating that little, one small change you could make is replacing the fruit with more vegetables. I would also recommend more legumes (navy beans for example) - you had mentioned you eat them often but I don't see them here. They are high in potassium, fiber, and iron (though it in non-heme), and even have a little calcium.  Edit: Why do you take your fiber supplement 2g at a time?"

It's Friday Fish night, so replace fish with bean salad, black bean tacos or hummus and that's pretty much what we have during the weekdays.  And, since I weigh all my food, I didn't give you a visual for my lunch, but it ends up being 3-4 scallions, a handful of radishes, 3 mushrooms and 1 medium carrot. By the USDA standards, it's 3 half-cup servings and the cup of green beans is another 2 half-cup servings, which with the apple and 2Tbsp of raisins is 6-1/2 servings of fruit and vegetables.   I work really hard to plan meals that meet all the minimum requirements for good nutrition. And, yeah, I probably rely too much on the national standards, but I figure it's their job to compile and aggregate all the studies and data done over a five-year timespan and work new information into existing data. I tend to trust them to provide the best information more than someone making a direct profit on branded boxed meals. Also, by sticking with one standard, it's easier to prevent myself from spinning out of control with all the contrary and diametrically opposing advice that I could find with a little Google-fu.  My base metabolic rate is 1633C/day. But all the descriptors in the activity levels: sedentary, moderate, active are too vague. They say ""in addition to your regular activities,"" so I usually pick sedentary and anything I do on top of that I log. Since I stay home with my daughter and nephews all day long, and we're active--not TV-watching slugs--so all the running around after the kids, cleaning and yard work and yoga I do I count as ""daily activities."" Now that it's spring, I'm going to be doing most of my solo-commuting by bike, but by summer, I'll probably drop it off separate logging since I'll be biking daily. If I can get down to 179 before it gets too hot, I can start running again. I've been advised by my doctor not to do much weight-bearing cardio until reaching an ""overweight"" weight (179) because of sciatica I developed during my pregnancy; but I do love to run! I was training for a half-marathon before the sciatica flared up. It was so bad I had to stop for two years! So, I add 200 sedentary calories per day to my BMR (1833), subtract 500 calories to lose a pound per week (1333), nutrition-plan for 1200 (1000 actual food, 200 oils, dressings, added sugars) and figure the extra 133 I don't plan daily is my splurge amount, like if my husband brings me home a Hmong egg roll, or (like it's Mother's Day this weekend) we go out to eat, or if my one-year old nephew force-feeds me his graham crackers.  Is this not right? This is sort of why I posted this whole thing; I haven't been able to figure out how to eat everything I'm supposed to eat and still lose weight.

Those ""servings"" of fruit and vegetables doesn't really matter (especially because they're measuring solid food like mushrooms and green beans in cups!), especially if you're being this attentive to your diet. Different vegetables and fruits have different nutrients, so it's entirely possible to eat many more servings than the recommended minimum but still be deficient in certain vitamins/minerals. That's why I would cut out the apple and raisins- they're less nutrient-dense than many vegetables. In any case, that's still not a lot of vegetables. They're low in calories and nutrient-dense, which is exactly what you need.  As long as you're not losing like 3 lbs/wk or something like that then you actually are eating the amount you need. ~1 lb/wk would be a good balance between speed and health.  Hummus has a lot of oil in it, which you can't really afford to fit in your diet, but beans are definitely good. In fact I would prioritize them over grains (oats, rice) because of their nutrients.  There actually is a significant amount of lobbying involved in the USDA guidelines. The USDA guidelines significantly impact the profits of certain industries, so unfortunately, it's not all good science, although it could be worse (it's way better than getting nutritional info from some paleo blog or something, that's for sure).

nutrition,357v58,kosaku_kiwajiri,5,Thu May 7 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Getting your calories from fat and protein is better for weight loss purposes. Whereas carbohydrates and protein are better for bulking. Roughly speaking of course.  No need to worry about fats. Not even saturated fat. However you should watch your omega 6:3 ratio. Use supplements if needed.  100g protein for your 76.6 kg is 1.3 g/kg. The rates that maximize muscle protein synthesis rates are 0.8 g/kg for sedentary people, 1.4 g/kg for endurance athletes, and 1.8 g/kg for strength athletes. That 1.3 g/kg seems alright. You could get away with less, but you have to be aware that any muscle gain is going to be slower.  The reason your low carb attempt did not work is that low carb adaptation (also called keto induction or keto flu) takes time and requires electrolyte supplementation.  It is not a diaster if your carbs are a bit higher, just make sure they are less than 120g, the cutoff point I usually recommend. However, I would ditch grains and grain products in particular.  Carbohydrates, protein shakes, and insulin spikes are not evil, assuming they are timed during/after exercise. Avoid soy though please.  These macros are safe, however I would approach macronutrient planning a bit differently:   Choose a carbohydrate limit anywhere from 20 to 120 g Choose a protein target based on your bodyweight and activity levels, anywhere from 0.8 g/kg through 1.4 g/kg to 1.8 g/kg. Fill the rest of your calories from fat. Adjust fat intake to provide satiety, match your calorie goals, or match your actual weight loss rate. Never ever have more than 30% caloric deficit.   Visit /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo, they should have ideas on how to increase your protein intake without a side serving of carbs."

nutrition,354ho4,NikolaeVarius,20,Thu May 7 01:23:58 2015 UTC,Interesting.  This must be the cause for rigamortis.  The cells use up its remaining ATP to convert glucose-6-phosphate into pyruvate into Lactic acid.  Thus once the muscles run out of ATP the body becomes stiff.  Why the cells do this is beyond me.
nutrition,354ho4,RiseAboveRuin,9,Thu May 7 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"The interaction between the proteins lactin and myosin is the core of muscle movement. If you look at a diagram of what it looks like,, it's kind of like a hand pulling on a rope, then releasing, then reaching forward to pull more rope. ATP is required for the chemical process for the ""release"" part. Without the energy from ATP,  the cells are stuck at the level of contraction they were at when the ATP ran out"
nutrition,354ho4,beyardo,4,Thu May 7 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"So, the protein that causes contraction of the muscle fiber is attached to actin, which is a sort of scaffolding. When ATP binds to the actin-myosin cross bridge, it causes a conformational change in the myosin which causes the myosin to detach from the actin filament. ATP then undergoes hydrolysis to ADP which causes another change which causes the myosin to stretch forward over the actin. When the ADP falls off, it causes the myosin to reach down, grab the actin and pull, which causes a contraction.  So basically when you die, ATP attaches to your muscle fibers. It is then undergoes hydrolysis and then detatches. Once all of the ATP in the cell is used up, it causes the muscles to stay contracted, since the absence of ATP and ADP is a state in which myosin is bound tightly to the actin crossbridge. Eventually these proteins break down, which causes the release from rigamortis. It's a simple byproduct of the biochemical process that forces muscle fibers to contract.  Here's this if you want to see it graphically: http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/bridge.shtml"

Why ATP hydrolysis causes conformation changes? Or why muscle seizure occurs following death? If the latter, there is no reason. It is not selected for in any way evolutionary because you are already dead before it occurs and you can't reproduce after dying. It's just what happens as you run out of ATP. When you die there is still a whole bunch of ATP bouncing around in your cells, and even after death chemical reactions will occur in the presence of all of the right catalysts. All the ATP --> ADP --> shit breaks down. Your cells are just a bag full of chemicals, and even when you are dead as a person those chemical reactions continue to occur in your cells. Maybe I'm not understanding your question properly? If you're more clear with your query I will answer if I can. =)"

I know a lot about molecular biology, glycolysis, ATP production and breakdown, but I couldn't tell you why exactly meat doesn't have carbs lol.  I've never thought about this before!  Perhaps because glycogen is not a digestible form of sugar in the intestines?  Glycogen is essentially glucose with a phosphate molecule attached to it.  The entire human body only contains ~800-2000 kcal in muscle glycogen. That's 200-500g of glucose-6-phosphate.  Perhaps the tiny 4oz chicken breast has such a minute amount that it's negligible."
nutrition,354ho4,RiseAboveRuin,3,Thu May 7 01:22:03 2015 UTC,Glycogen will get used up in anaerobic glycolysis to produce lactic acid.  The lactic acid will then lower the pH of the meat eventually denaturing enzymes in the meat.

It is worth noting zinc is not absorbed as well from plant sources as it is from animal sources.   The body has no specialized storage mechanism for zinc. Your average daily intake should meet RDA and reliable sources of zinc should be consumed daily.

nutrition,3500aw,jemattie,0,Wed May 6 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"If you increase carb or protein intake relative to fat, your body will expend more energy (calories out). Converting carbs and protein into fat is quite inefficient (and carbs are almost never stored as fat at an appreciable rate under normal circumstances, even when overfeeding). Also, eating more carbs will probably make you more active, making you burn more calories.    Dietary fat is stored as body fat very easily. It happens every time you eat fat.  So yes, there's a difference. But the laws of nature are not broken. And in practice, the differences are small and it's usually a waste of time to spend a lot of energy on it."
nutrition,3500aw,jemattie,4,Wed May 6 13:23:32 2015 UTC,Why would eating more carbs make you more active? Your body just burns more energy doing nothing if you eat more carbs or protein?
nutrition,3500aw,dreiter,1 point,Wed May 6 13:52:55 2015 UTC,"During overfeeding, non-exercise adaptive thermogenesis (NEAT) increases. The effect is general though, it's not limited to carbohydrates:     NEAT proved to be the principal mediator of resistance to fat gain with overfeeding. The average increase in NEAT (336 kcal/day) accounted for two-thirds of the increase in daily energy expenditure (Table 2), and the range of change in NEAT in our volunteers was large (298 to 1692 kcal/day). [...] Thus, activation of NEAT can explain the variability in fat gain with overeating. As humans overeat, those with effective activation of NEAT can dissipate the excess energy so that it is not available for storage as fat, whereas those with lesser degrees of NEAT activation will likely have greater fat gain and be predisposed to develop obesity. The maximum increase in NEAT that we detected (692 kcal/day, volunteer 5) could be accounted for by an increase in strolling-equivalent activity (25) by about 15 min/hour during waking hours.     Levine, James A., Norman L. Eberhardt, and Michael D. Jensen. ""Role of nonexercise activity thermogenesis in resistance to fat gain in humans."" Science 283.5399 (1999): 212-214.   NEAT was directly implicated in the physiology of weight gain when 16 sedentary, lean individuals were carefully overfed by 1,000 kcal/day (63). All components of energy expenditure and body composition were carefully determined. There was a 10-fold variation in fat gain and an 8-fold variation in changes in NEAT. Those individuals who increased their NEAT the most gained the least fat with overfeeding, and those individuals who failed to increase their NEAT with overfeeding gained the most fat (Fig. 5) (63). Studies are too sparse to define how changes in the amount of nonexercise activity interplay with changes in energy efficiency; the bulk of evidence suggests that increases in the amount of physical activity predominate. Changes in BMR and TEF were not predictive of changes in fat gain. These data strongly imply that NEAT may counterbalance fat gain with positive energy balance, when appetite is clamped.     Levine, James A. ""Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT): environment and biology."" American Journal of Physiology-Endocrinology And Metabolism 286.5 (2004): E675-E685.  I mentioned carbohydrates specifically because of their central effect on fatigue. Eating carbs generally reduces fatigue, and you're more likely to move when you're not fatigued."
nutrition,3500aw,autowikibot,18,Wed May 6 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"First I will make a quick mention about the protein effeciency ratio.  It was originally developed using rats, and has been found to be not so great.  Nowadays, most everyone is using the PDCAAS to help determine protein quality, although even that system has issues.  You will see arguments for both sides of the debate.  I will say only two things about the issue.   Foods will certainly have effects on the body beyond the simple 'calories in, calories out' equation. For example, some foods are more filling (protein, fiber), some foods affect hormones, some affect gut bacteria, some make people crave junk foods, some make people feel satisfied with their diet plan.  All of these factors will help determine the success and effectiveness of a weight loss, maintenance, or weight gain program. With that being said, a calorie is most certainly just a calorie.  If you intake 1000 calories of energy and burn 1100 calories of energy, you WILL lose weight.  The trick is how to accurately determine your intake and outtake, and how different foods affect your goals, as I mentioned above.   TL;DR - The 'a calorie is just a calorie' statement is too simplistic to be useful, although it is scientifically accurate."

The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as ""the preferred 'best'"" method to determine protein quality.

For example, if 1g of casein had 1 calorie, then 1g of peanut protein would have 0.52 calories? I know the numbers are off, but is that how the scale works ratio wise?  Also, I've started looking into how they measure calories in food, and it looks like it's mostly guess work (Atwater method). Am I wrong about this as well? I mean, they don't actually calculate how many calories we actually get from a specific food, just how much they think we get."
nutrition,3500aw,GoodGuyReyy,3,Wed May 6 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"No, PDCAAS is just a measure of the ratio of amino acids in a protein compared to the 'optimal' ratio for the human body. A lower score means the protein isn't perfectly balanced to meet the needs of the human body, and you would need to eat other sources of protein throughout the day to get a good amino acid balance. The score doesn't have anything to do with calories.  For calories, protein gives about 4 calories per gram, fat gives 9 calories per gram, carbs are about 4 calories per gram, and fiber is 0-2, depending on the type.  You are right that there is no perfect way of measuring the calories in foods, since the human body isn't equivalent to an Atwater system. However, a better method hasn't been determined yet.  Let me ask, do you have a goal with these questions or are you just interested?"

I eat low carb, and from what I understand it seems most people think it increases satiety, so you eat less. This makes sense, and their reasoning was that because calories in and out is the whole equation, the type of calories doesn't matter.  It didn't make sense that we digest everything the same way, so I decided to try and look into it. I found the protein efficiency thing I linked, which from what I understood was measured by looking at mass gain in rats. Since this means that not all protein is digested the same in rats I assumed it would be similar with humans, and with fat and carbs.  So I asked the question here, and learnt even more."

It can get trickier if your talking about going from one diet to another, and the main reason is fiber.  By definition fiber is a substance that has no energy exchange in the body and has no byproducts that can have an energy exchange.  At any rate, if I switch from a highly processed food diet to a high vegetable diet it's possible to increase your calories and lose weight, because fiber is counted in the calorie calculation but your body doesn't use the calories from it.  I'm in the middle of doing just that and have lost 4lbs in 3months increasing my calories by ~450/day.  It may seem like a small amount but my intention was never to lose weight but to improve health markers.  I keep having to increase my calories to stop losing weight.  I'm now increasing them a further 100 calories to that end.  Fiber also mitigates insulin spikes which helps in losing weight.  I don't know why labels count fiber in the calories.  The other thing that throws calculations off is protein.  Every cell in your body needs nitrogen based molecules so a big chunk of what you eat ends up being used for that and not muscle, storage or energy.  Depending on your needs this might make a difference."

The question is ""what weight?""  I'd bet he lost more muscle and less fat than someone who ate a high protein diet at deficit. You won't find a body builder doing a cut doing it on a twinkies deficit, for instance. Metabolically, on the cellular level, you're never running on a deficit unless you're dying - you're running at your regular rate, just on calories from the rest of the body. You're getting fats from your fat cells to power the Krebs cycle, or you're getting carbs from protein, through gluconeogenisis - that protein can be from a chicken breast or your own muscle, but you're metabolizing it, one way or the other.   The psychological aspect is why temporary ""diets"" don't work, I believe. You can cut calories one of 2 ways - small portions, that you have to control forever, or large portions of low calorie foods. Most ""diets"" are portion control. What's psychologically easier is eating all you want - but if that's a ton of green leafy vegetables, broccoli, kale, carrots, eggplant, peppers, cucumber, asparagus (need I go on? Lol)  followed by good sources of protein, you are likely to be full long before you hit a caloric surplus.   That's all it is. Eat mostly vegetables, followed by meat, and a little fruit. Limit or expel the grains (especially refined) and added sugars, and it's almost impossible to get fat, and you can eat that way forever. I don't see how weight loss is hard for people.

You can just swap what you eat (eat more whole foods that fill you up because they're higher in protein and fiber) and you can eat less without being hungry.  One alternative is to just eat the less of the standard processed sugar, processed grain diet and eat less total food which will make you hungry.  Let's say you religiously count calories.

I'm not trying to pick a fight, but if there are eating disorders or psychological issues present then further counseling is needed.  I would also never recommend calorie counting to someone struggling to lose weight because it also requires a lot of effort to weigh food and input meals into apps/software to count them.  My point is just that if you do use calorie counting it DOES work."

You shouldn't need to be 50% (or even 20%) under the caloric requirement estimators to lose weight.  If you don't maintain your weight afterwards, you didn't do yourself any favors.  Are you going to count calories for the rest of your life?   I would also never recommend calorie counting to someone struggling to lose weight because it also requires a lot of effort to weigh food and input meals into apps/software to count them.

My point is you are saying calorie counting is worthless and inaccurate and that is simply not the case.  And I didn't bring it up, the whole thread is a discussion of it."
nutrition,3500aw,SunShineImaDine,-2,Wed May 6 05:18:53 2015 UTC,"and inaccurate    It is very inaccurate and that's just on the counting side   According to a new study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, prepared foods may contain an average of 8% more calories than their package labels own up to and restaurant meals may contain a whopping 18% more. Worse still, as far as Food and Drug Administration regulations are concerned, that's perfectly O.K.  No one would deny that the 18% calorie overload on restaurant menus is a problem. The additional 8% in frozen foods sounds less serious; in a 500-calorie entree, after all, 8% adds only 40 calories. That, however, is in a single meal. Over the course of a year, consuming just 5% more than you need in a 2,000-calorie diet can mean a 10-lb. weight gain. ""The 18% and 8% figures are just what you need not to lose weight,"" says Roberts.   http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1951798,00.html  If the numbers you count are lies and the numbers you need are wrong, what's the point?   You can eat 150 calories under maintenance and lose weight   If you can get both of those numbers accurately and not eat over that even though you're hungry.  That's also assuming calories out doesn't affect calories in (e.g. running makes you hungry) or that calories in affects calories out (protein creates more heat).  This is not arithmetic.  It's biology.  Do you really want to be hungry all the time so you can look a little better?  Do you really have the willpower to maintain that for the next 50 or so years?  I don't blame people for giving up.  As I said before and gave a much more complicated formula, calories in-out is a drastically oversimplified version of what is actually going on.  There's a reason many people find they lose weight on a vegetarian diet.  I'm not a vegetarian, but honestly it's a lot better than the average."
nutrition,3500aw,deianarnaudov,7,Wed May 6 05:51:12 2015 UTC,"Again you are twisting things.  Labels and menus are wrong?  Of course.  My point is that if you prepare food, weigh it, and use that weight with established values for the food (from the USDA for instance), then it is pretty accurate.  And the ""difference"" between different proteins and heat generation and all those buzzwords you are throwing around are fairly small or they are accounted for by whatever energy expenditure estimation you are using.  Is calorie counting the best way to lose weight?  No.  Is it 100% accurate? No.  Can it be a very effective tool for someone looking to lose weight?  Yes.  Values give people a frame of reference.  If you tell someone to eat healthy and they will lose weight, they will have a hard time finding any meaning in that.  With calorie counting and an estimated energy requirement they can easier understand the amount of food they need to eat.  Eat until you are full or eat healthy are even more vague and incomprehensible than calorie counting."

It's clearly the preferred kind in mammalian bodies.   That doesn't mean ""go out and eat a bunch of saturated fat with your high carbohydrate diet"" however.   The whole trouble with the American diet is that highly palatable but nutritionally deficit mix of high fat / high carb  / low protein / low fiber diet. You have tons of densely packed calories from fats, and no need to burn sugars, especially among the sedentary, so they sit there and convert to LDL and triglycerides and fat.   Also, with omega 6's being pro-inflammatory in their production of eicosanoids, I don't trust polyunsaturated as being that healthy.   The best diet seems to simply be one that is very high in protein and fiber, with some limited healthy fats (monounsaturated, balanced omega 3 to 6, possibly saturated?) and as many complex carbs as are needed for intense exercise and no more. Everything that increases satiety and minimizes spikes in blood sugar.   TL,DR: I doubt saturated fats are as bad as thought once, but that doesn't mean increase calories from them on top of an already bad standard American diet."

The review concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the recommendations.  http://openheart.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000229.full  Here's another bit on saturated fat   Saturated fat prevents coronary artery disease? An American paradox  What are the effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in comparison with those of a higher-fat, lower-carbohydrate diet? The response differs by the 2 main types of hyperlipidemia: simple hypercholesterolemia and combined hyperlipidemia. In our studies of simple hypercholesterolemia in men, a fat intake <25% of energy and a carbohydrate intake >60% of energy was associated with a sustained increase in triacylglycerol of 40%, a decrease in HDL cholesterol of 3.5%, and no further decrease in LDL in comparison with higher fat intakes (5). In contrast, a low-fat diet in persons with combined hyperlipidemia caused no worsening of triacylglycerol or HDL, but intakes of fat >40% of energy and of carbohydrate <45% of energy for 2 y were associated with a lower triacylglycerol concentration at a stable weight (6). In the subjects of Mozaffarian et al, a greater saturated fat intake paralleled a total fat intake, which ranged from 18% to 32% of energy in the first to fourth quartiles. Modest favorable trends in triacylglycerol and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were observed with higher fat intakes.  These effects include the paradox that a high-fat, highâsaturated fat diet is associated with diminished coronary artery disease progression in women with the metabolic syndrome, a condition that is epidemic in the United States.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/5/1102.full  Yes, saturated fat (some types at least) raises LDL.  It also raises HDL."

More data are needed to elucidate whether CVD risks are likely to be influenced by the specific nutrients used to replace saturated fat."" [1] [2] Replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates increases small, dense LDL particles, shifts to an overall atherogenic lipid profile, and increases incidence of diabetes and obesity. Replacing saturated fat with omega 6 polyunsaturated fats increases risk of cancer, increases risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular events, and death to heart disease and overall mortality, increases oxidized LDL-C, and reduces HDL-C. [3] ""The results show that dietary and plasma saturated fat are not related, and that increasing dietary carbohydrate across a range of intakes promotes incremental increases in plasma palmitoleic acid, a biomarker consistently associated with adverse health outcomes."" [4] ""They clearly confirm that carbohydrate restriction leads to an improvement in atherogenic lipid states in the absence of weight loss or in the presence of higher saturated fat. In distinction, low fat diets seem to require weight loss for effective improvement in atherogenic dyslipidemia."" [5] ""In postmenopausal women with relatively low total fat intake, a greater saturated fat intake is associated with less progression of coronary atherosclerosis, whereas carbohydrate intake is associated with a greater progression."" [6] ""Limited Effect of Dietary Saturated Fat on Plasma Saturated Fat in the Context of a Low Carbohydrate Diet"" [7] Extra: Fatty acid composition of the brain includes plenty of saturated, monounsaturated and omega 3 and 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Are you absolutely sure de novo lipogenesis can replicate the fatty acid profile that is optimal for brain function? [8]   tl;dr: Saturated fat could be a problem only in the context of a carbohydrate rich diet, if it is at all. Replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates or omega 6 fatty acids is obviously worse for health.

Despite the heavy emphasis on protein, and the ease of getting it from diet or supplements, there are plenty of people, mainly vegetarians, whose protein intake is inadequate for optimal muscle growth or even retention.  This is actually a problem with studies on vegetarians: Vegetarian diets are often touted to decrease body mass, but lean mass and fat mass is rarely differentiated.  Remember: You need 0.8 g/kg as a sedentary person, 1.4 g/kg as an endurance athlete, or 1.8 g/kg as a strength athlete to maximize muscle protein synthesis rates. The 0.4-0.7 g/kg advocated by some people is a goddamn joke even for sedentary people.   Liver may have a lot of nutrients, but that's only in comparison to non-organ meat.   And in comparison to entire food categories.  Obviously you should not rely on liver as your sole source of nutrients. Balanced diet, remember? Add other offal, eggs, fish, dairy, vegetables, nuts, and you are much closer to a healthy, balanced diet.  That reminds me, I should do some nutrient density comparison based on the USDA database.   Compared to just eating enough and a variety of vegetables over the course of a day, liver loses it's advantage.   So you admit that liver is so nutrient dense that you need an entire group of vegetables specifically chosen to match its nutrient density? :)  You have not said anything about the number and amount of vegetables required for full substition however.  Vegetables and plants have disadvantages that make full replacement of meat impossible:   Non-bioavailable versions of nutrients: non-heme iron Provitamins that are improperly converted: ALA into EPA, beta-carotene into vitamin A, vitamin K1 into vitamin K2 Anti-nutrients that block the absorption of other nutrients: oxalates, polyphenols, phytates, tannin Missing essential nutrients: vitamin B12, vitamin D from low dietary intake, and low cholesterol and saturated fat intake Missing semi-essential and useful nutrients: carnitine, creatine, taurine, carnosine, omega-3 bound phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, coenzyme Q10 from low cholesterol and saturated fat intake Incomplete amino acid profile Improper fatty acid profile   Some people go even as far to ditch plants due to these issues. I would not recommend that:   Plants still have the upper hand in potassium, fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin E. There are also useful compounds that are found primarily in plants: sulforaphane, diindolylmethane, turmeric, piperine, EGCG, theanine, phytonutrients, caffeine, et cetera.

Compared to just eating enough and a variety of vegetables over the course of a day, liver loses it's advantage.   You won't get an appreciable number of calories from liver or non-starchy veggies.  On a per calorie basis or a per 100 grams basis, liver comes out way ahead of everything else.  It's so nutrient dense, you shouldn't eat it daily.  I know of no vegetable that you need to limit in that way."

Brown rice is a notable source of protein, B vitamins, minerals, and fiber.  So is whole wheat pasta.  Fiber is a nutrient in which the typical western diet is severely deficient so I will respectfully disagree that swapping out the starches I mentioned in favor of meat is a superior choice.  That said, if some liver is the difference between you eating 10+ servings of vegetables a day and not then please dump it in.  :)  Also, a serving of liver most certainly contains fat and a ton of cholesterol (but let's not derail the discussion)."

nutrition,34y4hq,chulbert,1 point,Wed May 6 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"Macros are actually pretty close to what I consider ideal for the general public. My ideal is 120g net carbs, 0.8 or 1.4 or 1.8 g/kg protein depending on activity levels, with the rest of the calories coming from fat. This diet is ~150g net carbs, ~1.8g g/kg protein assuming a 80kg person, with the rest of the calories coming from fat. It does have a bit of caloric excess however. Linearly scaling back to 2000 calories, we get ~130g net carbs, ~1.3 g/kg protein assuming a 80kg person, with the rest of the calories coming from fat. That is really close to my ideal for an endurance athlete.  Not sure what RDA values did (s)he use, it displays the fiber intake as 112% of RDA.  Unpopular opinion follows, please comment instead of downvoting: Fiber is slightly overrated, its main advantage is to interfere with carbohydrate absorption, which is not particularly important to this diet, and to serve as a... bulking agent, the importance of which varies on a case by case basis. I consider its effects on cholesterol reabsorption, speed of food movement, and hydration status to be disadvantageous. I do not think particular attention should be given to fiber when creating a diet plan, unless there are problems caused by too low or too high fiber intake."

If you don't want a meaningful credential and just want information for personal benefit or the pursuit of knowledge, you can check out any of the MOOC platforms for courses offered by University professors.

nutrition,34yoia,BuddhistSagan,2,Tue May 5 23:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, getting a DTR and actually using it is considered very relevant experience for applicants into dietetics programs. But to just get into the didactic program (coursework) at the bachelor's level, you don't necessarily have to be an amazing candidate, just someone who has completed the prerequisite sciences. Getting into the internship is where it gets really competitive.  You have a few options at a school with no didactic program. Either way you should be taking the prerequisite biology, chemistry, and microbiology courses. Those conveniently fit into a biology major, so you could stay at UCF and major in biology and then apply for a master's program for people without a Verification Statement (i.e. you've done all the dietetics coursework).  If you want to transfer, same advice on the prereqs, but I would recommend going to another state school because private schools are expensive and 1) you might not get an internship, which makes paying back loans really hard, and 2) you still have to pay for the internship itself and dietitians don't make good money right off the bat (especially if only BS and not MS/MPH) so loans could be a burden, both financially and mentally."

Based on what I know of your wife (5'5"", 150lbs, and assuming she's early-mid 30s?), her BMI is 25 (the exact border between regular and overweight), and she probably needs between 1900 or 2000 calories per day, depending on her activity level, to sustain that.

nutrition,34u72g,billsil,3,Tue May 5 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"Most fried foods. Anything heavy with grease and I've got to take high doses of antacids such as dexilant to control the symptoms.

You gotta fix your health issues and your weight will follow.  I'd strongly suggest you try cutting wheat.  I also test negative for Celiac.  Bread screws me up so badly (brain fog, depression, insomnia, serious GI issues).  Just try it for 30 days.  Bit about me...3 years ago as a 29 year old male, I was 5'10"" and 115 pounds (BMI of 16.5).  I quit bread and put on 30 pounds in a year.  I've dropped a lot of weight (15-20 pounds) a few times when my gut goes on the fritz, but I'm at 145 for now.  My gut was constantly upset until I cut wheat and then it started behaving nicely.  I did find 9 other food intorelances along the way though.    I'd also try probiotics.  Poor gut flora leads to an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria that trigger an immune reaction.  If you can kill off some of them, you might find some of your food intolerances go away."

All the other food issues you have are likely a long term reaction to not solving your health issues (and thus will probably just go away when you find the root cause).  A staple food (e.g. wheat) makes a lot of sense.  I would eat bread with every meal and so I thought feeling lousy was normal.  The worst symptoms that caused me to be 115 pounds hit me ~24 hours later.  I got tested for allergies and they found nothing.  I just copied this woman in order to fix my health.

Again, it'll be calorie dense. Less filling. Dried plums, apples, pineapple. All dense and delciious.   I'd also try to increase your fat intake.

You can make it with cream, which is almost entirely fat and has little to no dairy. You could also use coconut milk, almond milk, or lactaid milk.  You should really dig into this - most people think you can't have cheese, but that's not true. Most hard, aged cheeses are 100% lactose free because the bacteria eats the sugar (lactose). Go ahead and make some mac 'n cheese with real cheddar and real cream and she should be fine.   Soft and/or non-aged cheese will be a different story. Brie? Love it! But it hates me :( Mozzarella can be surprisingly lactose free. Try an aged variety, or a high-end cheese with no milk solids or other fillers.  A good rule of thumb is that if there's no sugar on the label, there's no (or very little) lactose (milk sugar).   You might want to try raw milk if you're up to it.

Phytic and oxalic acid, both present in many plants, including spinach, greatly reduce bioavailability of non-heme (plant sourced) iron, but the effect is neutralized by cooking.  If iron-absorption isn't a concern for you, I'd still recommend adding cooked spinach and kale to your dishes, as you can get some pretty snazzy tastes that way, like the kale chips already mentioned, or sauteeing the spinach, incorporating it in a lasagna or pasta dish, or in a dip (like spinach-artichoke.) A splash of lemon juice or vinegar can brighten the flavor, as well as help you absorb more iron.   Also, many of the vitamins are fat-soluble, so don't be afraid to add some fat to whatever you're preparing.

I've seen a lot of people asking about custom made supplements and it got me thinking. That's why I was asking about it here.   How would something like this cost more than already made supplement formulas?  For example, a company that makes their own supplements will usually buy their ingredients in bulk then mix it all up and throw it into some capsules. So, if a company were to offer custom made supplements, they'd just need to buy bulk powders to keep final costs low, the only thing that would make it cost more is the labor required to make the custom supplements but this could be automated to a certain degree.   Now obviously there are other things to consider but I thought this would be a great idea for people who can't find the exact supplement they need or want. And I know that people can do this, themselves, at home but most people either don't like taking the time to do it or don't like dealing with everything to make complex mixes and put them in capsules at the right amount and be able to include a filler if necessary.

Don't worry if you're not 100% of something, the RDI includes a margin of error, so you can be consistently below 100% and not have a deficiency.   The only thing I see on here that is concerning is your lack of fiber. For a man the RDI is like 38grams or something, going over that just gives you more benefits, and there is no maximum amount of fiber.   If you're not having large, smooth, clean, easy poops at least once a day then you need more fiber.  If these numbers include your multivitamin, then yes, you have an issue. The nutrients that can be isolated and delivered in pill form in any meaningful, usable way are limited. There are lots of things that make food good for us that have not been discovered, cannot be isolated, or cannot be put into a put into a shelf stable, pill form and have the same efficacy.

nutrition,34rwgx,CasualNerdAU,5,Mon May 4 07:09:31 2015 UTC,"""Isomaltulose is fully absorbed in the small intestine as glucose and fructose. Like sucrose, it is fully digested and provides the same caloric value of approximately 4 cal/g.""  Even though it apparently is absorbed slower than sugar, it still has the full calories and otherwise behaves like sugar. I don't see much advantage, especially considering the cost.   Sugar substitues like Erythritol  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythritol are more interesting in my opinion because they are similar to sugar but without the calories. It's more expensive than sugar, but is often used as a 1:1 replacement."
nutrition,34rwgx,m092,-2,Mon May 4 07:42:20 2015 UTC,That depends. I need around 2000 calories a day in order to function normally and not be hungry. I can count on isomaltulose to provide some of these calories in a steady manner thought the day. Zero calorie substitutes do not nourish at all and the main problem with regular sugar is that it spikes the glucose level in the blood which is dramatically worse than a steady release. That being said I can see the zero calorie alternatives being useful in some diets.
nutrition,34rwgx,growingupsux,7,Mon May 4 08:03:42 2015 UTC,"Caloric content isn't very strongly correlated with the feeling of fullness. There are many foods with the same caloric content that have very differing effects on satiation and satiety. That's actually one of the bigger contributing factors [lol citation needed] to people overeating (and thus obesity) is the consumption of high calorie foods with low effect on satiety and satiation.  Eating sucrose, isomaltulose or aspartarme are all poor choices for feeling full anyway."

If you're trying to cut calories then yeah isomaltulose wouldn't make much sense, but if you're trying to maintain caloric intake then replacing any current regular sugar use with isomaltulose still does have the benefit of not having a spike and crash.   I wouldn't necessarily equate ""being hungry"" and ""not feeling full,"" I can think of plenty of times where I was borderline nauseated and still felt the fatigue and lightheadedness of needing to eat something."
nutrition,34rwgx,CasualNerdAU,1 point,Mon May 4 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Satiety is literally a lack of hunger.  I can understand experiencing satiation without satiety, and that's why I mentioned them both. Again, neither are as strongly correlated with the caloric content of the food as many other factors."
nutrition,34rwgx,Khulric,6,Mon May 4 16:37:11 2015 UTC,I guess different people = different needs. If you need more calories why not eat more healthy fats ? No blood glucose spike. I eat very low sugar personally and it's been great for energy levels. It's not for everyone though. /r/keto

There's also the issue that cooking some foods some ways makes nutrients more or less bio available.  At the end of the day it's not a very practical concern for most people and situations and the differences are usually minimal."

nutrition,34pn4l,MPfiff,1 point,Mon May 4 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"But the problem with that is people are objectively bad at telling what is good or bad for them. Sugar, in moderation is fine for kids, and double blind studies have shown no relationship between sugar consumption and behavior, compared with a placebo, yet many parents are adamant,  based on their ""explorations"" that it is bad for their kid/ the kid's behavior.   It's true that it's hard to find a whole bunch of conclusive evidence regarding nutritional science, especially given special interest groups like the relationship between farmer's associations, and the FDA, etc, nevermind all the trade agreements. There's a great deal of money to be made at any level from misinforming the public. Just ask Dr. Oz.  But the bullshit flows from everyone, especially ourselves. Intuitive eating is simply too dependent on our own expectations. People are notoriously bad at knowing what's good for them, and it's damn near impossible to Isolate the placebo effect, or to control all the variables."

I think if you upped your cardio you'd loose weight.  Just don't eat more than this.  However, if you don't loose weight after a few weeks of exercise and don't want to increase your workouts I'd eliminate the white rice and lower the amount of peanut butter.  It looks generally healthy though and not a lot of calories.  Good luck."

This gives me a drink that tastes great, has 25g of carbs, 100kcals, 160mg of caffeine, Beta Alanine and all the essential amino acids.
