Iceland,3dk1jg,tgmmrs,32,Thu Jul 16 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"There's this classical school of thought in criminology, that the criminal weighs his benefit of the crime v.s. the punishment, accounting for the likelihood of getting caught. So, let's say he robs a bank for 100 monnies, imagines a 30% risk of getting caught, then the benefit is on average 70 monnies. Or we can imagine something about profiting from drug imports v.s. likelihood of getting caught and potential time in jail and how much monnies each smuggling trip must turn out to be worth it.   So, this school of thought goes, if we focus on catching more of them and punishing them really really hard, this cost-benefit calculus will show them that crime doesn't pay. Obviously, this makes no sense (and modern criminology acknowledges that of course, but lawmakers, government and conservatives lag behind). Most perpetrators of crime most of the time, be it assault, smuggling, murder or off-road driving, aren't really weighing the cost-benefit of what they're doing, they do it for a multitude of other reasons and most of the time thinking that they won't be caught (and most of the time they're actually right about that). And experience has shown multiple times all over the world that really harsh punishments don't deter people from committing crimes, just think of the death sentences in many places in Asia for importing drugs or the huge number of prisoners in the U.S. who are sitting there after being caught the third time for doing something stupid. They're obviously not approaching this with their smarts.  I'm all for punishing these bastards, especially for off-road driving and leaving shit and toilet paper in the most inappropriate places, but it's not die endlösnung for this kind of misbehavior. It's actually about (1) disseminating information and (2) making it easier for people not to do something stupid (like, having toilets, good roads to interesting places, maybe some limited area where you're actually allowed to drive ""off-road"", etc.). I think it's not just my liberal ass opinion, but actually based on empirical data. But there seems like a decision has been made to not do anything properly or well when it comes to tourism in Iceland, so let's expect the shit to pile up, both figuratively and literally.  But serious off-road offenders should be shot.  edit: it might be interesting to patrol these areas where people are shitting with a water pistol with some foul smelling but otherwise harmless liquid, and mercilessly spray over people that are shitting in stupid places."

As this is a small country, you can virtually keep tabs on everyone. You can also ban them from Iceland for life.  Crimes I mention specifically here are not related to serious crime like drugs smuggling. But as you write the rule with ""3 times and game over"". Well, you had 3 chances to learn NOT TO do something, so punishment is most likely fitting. World got dumbed down, and things like personal responsibility or common sense are outsourced.   At the end of the day, what behavior would be promoted via such actions? Respect the host country, don't shit where you shouldn't and just pay 200 kr, don't destroy nature that took millions of years to be created and would take decades to recover. Crimes I talk about are miniscule, but massive to the culture of Icelanders. If everyone who comes there respected that, they would leave as a better person... :)"

Iceland,3dk1jg,garbagemon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:26:11 2015 UTC,"(like, having toilets, good roads to interesting places, maybe some limited area where you're actually allowed to drive ""off-road"", etc.)   This is really important. One of the key things I've noticed in the road trips I've done in the past fortnight is that all the toilets and bins are in the town, not at the attractions.  If you want people to put stuff in bins, there have to be bins visible, and they have to be visible from every point at the attraction. That means dozens of them, regularly emptied. If people can't see a bin, they're just going to drop their rubbish where they stand, and screaming at them or fining them will not change that, because that's how humans operate, like it or not. It might make you feel better for a few minutes, but it won't solve your problem.  By far the worst case I saw was at Thingvellir, where the toilets cost 200kr to get in. Do you want people pissing on your rift valley? Because that's how you achieve it.  My proposal would be to have every tourist pay a 1500kr fee on entering the country, maybe issue a name/number combo a bit like a kennitala on entry, that they need in order to access major tourist sites.  Funnel all that money directly into a tourist management board, who can set up toilets and bins and marked tracks and so forth.  As a side note to OP: If you try to fine me at the airport, and I tell you to eat a dick, what are you going to do? Keep me here on your own dime? Not sure the EU court of human rights would side with you on that one :)"
Iceland,3dk1jg,always_wear_pyjamas,3,Sun Jul 19 09:06:25 2015 UTC,"The crazy thing is that Iceland is already profiting massively from tourists. The 1500 kr ""naturepass"" idea was very controversial, among other things because it would cost so much to set up the system to police it that there would be little money left. The problem with your proposal is also that it differentiates between foreigners and Icelanders, which we apparently can't have in the law.  So it's much more efficient to get this money through the tax system, which we should be doing already but a lot of tourist industries either don't pay VAT or very low tax, so most of this money is going to the pockets of very few people. It's funny actually, the largest operators in this industry, f.ex. the bus companies, are profiting massively from just driving people somewhere and leaving them there for an hour or so, and they don't see it in their interest to invest in infrastructure themselves at the popular places because they are just the bus company, and then they barely pay tax, but still they want the government to come around and fix everything for them.  It's a much better solution to finally tax the industry, we institutions and the workflow is already in place. It is potentially a lot more efficient, and possible solves this whole 'tragedy of the commons' aspect."

That amount could be added to the price of flight tickets to Iceland (flights stopping to fuel could be exempt) and wouldn't differentiate between Icelanders and others, thus avoiding that legal problem."

Iceland,3dk1jg,VoiceofTheMattress,2,Thu Jul 16 23:59:36 2015 UTC,"I have a related question related to offroading. I understand its illegal to drive off the existing tracks. I understand the reasoning also. Here in the Himalayas sometimes people wreck grasslands. In a tropical jungle greenlaning does not matter much as everything grows back quickly, but in harsh climates, it causes permanent damage to environment.  However, I see lots of icelanding tour companies offering glacier tours in big 4x4s. Now there are no tracks on glaciers. How is that not offroading. Why is it openly advertised and allowed? What if a tourist rents a big 4x4 with 35"" tires, and then goes on a glacier?   Many of these tours often drive where there are actually no roads, just river beds. Even the map does not show a F-road. That is offroading too?  So my conclusion is that either :   Some type of offroading is allowed other type is not allowed : If so, there needs to be clear guidelines Local tour companies are allowed offroading, but tourists are not : If so this is a protectionist racket and I seriously doubt such a thing can even happen in Iceland(one of the most honest countries I have ever been to!!)   So what is it? Are the rules clear? Where can we find those rules. Please understand I am not trolling. I would genuinely like to know what's okay and what's not.  And, I am sure somebody will come with a good answer. Some time back I posted a question about ""Closed"" and ""Not allowed"" F roads. I got the correct answer, if you cross a barrier which says ""Do not cross"" you are committing an offense, however, you can go on a closed F road in a suitable vehicle(like those winter tour companies)."
Iceland,3dk1jg,Oddstrider,7,Fri Jul 17 05:42:06 2015 UTC,"While off-road driving is illegal, the exception is driving on snow or ice and that applies also to glaciers. The law says:   Bannað er að aka vélknúnum ökutækjum utan vega. Þó er heimilt að aka slíkum tækjum á jöklum og snævi þakinni jörð utan vega utan þéttbýlis svo fremi jörð sé frosin eða snjóþekjan traust og augljóst að ekki sé hætta á náttúruspjöllum. (http://www.althingi.is/lagas/144a/2013060.html)   Rough translation:   It is prohibited to drive motorised vehichles off roads. However it is permitted to drive such vehicles on glaciers and ground covered in snow off roads outside of urban areas as long as the ground is frozen or the snow cover sturdy, and it is obvious that there is no risk of damage to nature or causing accidents.   Don't know whether it's a good idea or not, but that's why tour companies can offer 4x4 tours on glaciers."

Iceland,3dk1jg,Anages2,2,Fri Jul 17 12:37:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Icelandic companies offer these because they have it mapped out and now precisely where to go.

Icelanders are very respectful and protective of their nature. Just like you should have a guide for glacier walk, so you should have one for off-road driving. Iceland could be a dangerous place.
