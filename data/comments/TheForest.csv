TheForest,3e4odk,chenDawg,3,Tue Jul 21 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"I only play The Forest with friends, because in my library it is the best survival multiplayer that I own. If you have friends that respect your stuff and are willing to work together, it is a lot of fun. From building bases, surviving the attacks, cave exploring, or just embracing the sliver of story and mystery we are given, this game can be a lot of fun. I have played with friends mostly around each update, and have not been let down at the amount of content and multiplayer things they have improved. I have not played ARK, so I can not give my opinion on that."
TheForest,3e4odk,geekometer96,2,Tue Jul 21 22:54:27 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your input. This is very encouraging. I'd likely only be playing with one other person. Is the co-op server based or does one person just host the session?
TheForest,3e4odk,geekometer96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"One person hosts, and no one I know has had to port forward for it. Most things sync (some rabbits, lizards, all cannibals, most bugs). It has been quiet easy to launch multiplayer sessions.   In my humble opinion, this game would lean more on the horror/scary multiplayer side, which really does throw a spin on it, as apposed to Ark's dinosaur atmosphere."
TheForest,3e4odk,Smooth_McDouglette,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:01:06 2015 UTC,"ARK. Extremely promising, but currently so poorly optimized that even a supercomputer can barely run it properly.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IugoWO8mNhE"
TheForest,3e4odk,geekometer96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"I watched my friend buy it and boot it up. Terribly Terribly buggy, glitchy, and troubling. The Forest used to be in that stage too, where too many trees cut down would cause everyone's game to lag. It will (hopefully) be patched and get better. $30 is a lot to put down on an unfinished game. I hope they don't just drop it and run with the money."
TheForest,3e4odk,Smooth_McDouglette,2,Tue Jul 21 23:14:46 2015 UTC,"Probably not quite yet but it's certainly getting there.  I had lots of fun playing it but I don't feel there's enough polish or content to it to have much staying power just quite yet.  Don't get me wrong though, I have every expectation that this will flourish into an excellent game, but despite the impression you may have from videos and trailers it's far from a complete game.  Don't Starve is my go-to co-op survival game, and it's one of the best games I've ever played. I seriously doubt even the forest will top it, but that's more of a testament to how good DS is, rather than a knock against the forest."
TheForest,3e4odk,Smooth_McDouglette,3,Tue Jul 21 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore Don't Starve, but I cannot get into that game. It has literally everything I want out of a survival game, but I can't deal with the isometric perspective. I don't know why. :(  I want Don't Starve in a first person or third person 3D game. lol"
TheForest,3e4115,kingkang1988,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"This is a game I adore, but if you take the plunge don't judge it too hard. After all, it is still an alpha. If you decide to jump into it and have beef with issues and such, make sure to let endnightgames know, so that way you can help improve the game throughout it's community. This game does still have a handful of glitches, bugs, issues, and improper textures, but for the most part they are constantly improved and fixed if they are major. The Beta process will be what irons out the gameplay the most, as it seems they are still adding a lot of stuff in Alpha.   All of that aside, The Forest is a wonderful horror survival game that is truly original. If survival and horrors are your thing, go for it."
TheForest,3e4115,geekometer96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:37 2015 UTC,"Copying my post concerning this same question:   It really depends.   There's enough content here if you're willing to go looking for it, and it is a scary game when you first start it. Everything gradually feels routine once you've learned the tricks, but sometimes the game throws some surpises at you. And going spelunking in one of the many caves is always a tense experience.  But its also a game that can either get more interesting or more bland the more you play it. It depends on how creatively ""evil"" or ""clever"" you can get with the building system, setting up traps, gory effigies of your enemies, or simply building a huge wooden monument to your greatness are all possible... but like many survival games its very time consuming, and I'd argue its more tedious in this game since you can't carry logs in your pocket, but instead you have to make log holders and log sleds for faster transport. And not to mention that you will most likely me fighting cannibals on a daily basis, since these guys will not leave you alone if you piss them off enough.  But when you're finally done building it, its really satisfying, you suffered through hours cutting trees to make your three story mansion of doom, and you're going to damn well enjoy the view of the clearing, because seeing an entire forest clear cut by your hand reminds you and the natives about whose who on the island.  Now onto the thing that actually matters the glitches and performance, many of my problems with glitches come in the form of graphical bugs, some parts of the water are missing, the cave's darkness is sometimes a flat piece of black something (most likely a trigger for the cave lighting to kick in), bad pop in when leaving or entering a cave. And getting caught on geometery is a constant when climbing a mountain or spelunking in the caves.  And performance is a scattershot, some updates the game runs perfectly, some updates the game runs like a fat guy stuck in honey. If you have a shitty card, expect to be dicking around with graphics options for a while, and if you have a good card you might have to dick around with graphics options.  There is some balancing issues mainly concerning with stamina, you'll be running out of energy quick if you chop down to many trees, so you'll learn to start growing medicinal herbs to make energy mixes. Melee Combat can get really boring, there's no combo system, its mostly just a click until it stops moving deal (and hope you aren't winded before the attack) and somtimes blocking in case you're overwhelmed. I personally find the bow and arrow to feel underpowered, there's no real OOMPH in the animation or reaction when the arrow goes flying out.  However setting up traps, and making bombs and molotovs is where the games combat shines. Its so satifying seeing the natvies get set on fire, impaled, exploded, or captured in your traps as the blindly run towards your fort. Where you can then dice up their bodies into little pieces and have a BBQ with their legs being the main course.  And there isn't much in the way of story, its been really vauge hooks currently and I'm not expecting any plot to be added until at least version 30 or 40. But whats there has inspired /u/NativeKiller to write his own ficition I like to call the ""Killerverse"".  So I'd highly recommend The Forest if any of the things I've said interest you. But at its core its a sandbox game, and its different for everyone. Some people can't figure out what to do with their sand and just give up, need someone else, or do what the kid on the other side of the sandbox is doing. While other create elaborate buildings with their sand, making up new rules as time goes on, and thinking outside the box so much that it adds more to the sandbox for everyone else.  If you've played survival games before, and want something that'll put you more on edge and with a more rewarding building mechanic. I'd totally recommend The Forest in a heart beat, and by the time you'll be done with all that's currently in the game the new update might be around the corner or about to release so you'll have more to play with.  In terms of Early Access, I'd rank it up there with Kerbal Space Program, Software INC, Rust, ARK, and Don't Starve. Its updates are consistant, the devs communicate clearly when problems arrise and if things need to be pushed back, every update is a sizable chunk of content that normally reshapes the island entirely, and the community is a great one."

But once that's done, where's the fun? You're safe, you got water and food conserved near your house. So you'll have to pack up and go explore! Go find the katana, go find an improved spear, go find a flashlight, dynamite, and all that cool stuff. There's a lot to find on the island, more than you'd expect."

TheForest,3e0ykz,blankster22,5,Tue Jul 21 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly,  I think most of those huge bases you see are made with a mod. But I've managed to build some pretty nice bases in co-op. It's obviously easier when there's more people.   Sometimes I throw on vegetarian mode. It's not as boring as vegan. Especially in the beginning to secure a base. That way they still come out at night and there's plenty of time to figure things out."

TheForest,3e0ykz,Kadem2,3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been playing on vegan. I just like building and collecting things mostly. The cannibals come at you in droves if you have any sort of decent sized base and I was dying constantly.

TheForest,3e0ykz,Moloshe,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:28 2015 UTC,"It'd be pretty easily if you build on an island.  Otherwise I'll admittedly use vegan mode since cannibal attacks get kind of annoying an tedious.  If I do it regularly, I build a small defensive base near the site and slowly build it up.    If you don't want them to notice you, do it far from any of their camps so you'll be attacked less.  You can also use the raft to move  to another area safely, gather logs there, and bring them back. That way most of your environmental impact isn't actually close to your base.  It's a bit longer because of travel, but you're safe while moving and only have to be in guard when chopping trees down.  Oh, and build temporary bases all over the place so you can safe frequently and reload if necessary."
TheForest,3e0ykz,Moloshe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:18 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think now that there might be a strategy to building without drawing attention. Anyone want to brainstorm with me?
TheForest,3e0ykz,Tibokio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"the only thing that i find consistently works as a defensive strategy is to surround a compact camp with windowed walls, then place clusters of standing fires and effigies all around the perimeter (simple effigy in middle, 3 standing fires as close as possible in a triangle around them) so there is literally no space in between them. you can light them all through the windows or walls from within your base, and if you get a drying rack plus a small garden and loot suitcases during the day, you can build this all before nightfall onto the side of the plane and generally survive indefinitely.  the effigies dont damage enemies last i checked, but they flare up and will light groups of standing fires all at once if placed correctly. essentially you just have to make sure that they cant attack your wall by interrupting their attack animation with fire damage.  another strat is to build in the caves, because they spawn enemies only in very specific locations and numbers and there are basically 0 random attacks. the items that drop in a few of the cave areas can sometimes appear as often as once a minute, and there are plenty of little nooks and crannies that you can make safe with just 1 wall. especially if you have a rebreather, this is pretty fun, but its hard to get logs in there, so i generally only do this as like a little vacation home."
TheForest,3e0ykz,msalvatori,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"basically you start with one of these and then build as much as you can whenever the coast is clear, but make sure it's easy and safe for you to pop back into the base within a few seconds in case a patrol shows up, and you shouldnt have many problems. i also never really fight the mutants myself - i only use molotovs or traps for the most part"

Whether it increases it more than teeth is still unknown, and hasn't been fully tested by anyone (or at least they've not made it known).  A weak spear, you can find around ponds. They'll be stuck in the ground, and flashing. To make a better spear, combine a weak spear with 2 cloth and 3 bones (bones you can get from cooking arms and legs on the fire.

TheForest,3dlvth,Headcrabhat,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"While it's never been proven or disproven, I believe that the cannibals on the surface are more or less normal people. Clothing was first invented (in the warmer climates) to cover genitalia, which is used for procreation. This essentially makes your average native, who wears clothing, a normal person. The humanoid mutants in the cave visibly have no genitalia and therefore don't wear clothing. Procreation for the mutants is most likely achieved through some sort of digusting thing done through the spider mutant."

Whereas the other cannibals have clothes, weapons, shelters and they also seem more intelligent (They scream to communicate while the others don't, build, have religions, structured communities). They may not be as cannibalistic as we thought."

Is mounted in a skull inside a shipping container at multiple locations, so it would be the same model containing the same cassette at multiple places.  Cassette ? Is at the bottom of Virginia's lair (the huge one with the rope in and out and the babies).  Cassette ? Is in one of two severed head in a cave corridor on the floor. I think you crouch through a very short and wet area before it, but this region may have changed.  Cassette ? Is on a marked grave at multiple locations (same model same cassette, basically)  While I have listed multiple locations, some share the same cassette number. I haven't looked closely at my collection but I have the feeling Cassette 3 is still missing in action."

TheForest,3dhdks,DrChloroPhil,3,Thu Jul 16 08:34:18 2015 UTC,"Unless they add cannibal families in villages and we have the decision to either slaughter them or leave them be, I would probably always end up on the conclusion that the cannibals are the monsters, being that they tote around dead humans all the time (yes I know we do that too, but not as intently) and they worship ACTUAL MONSTERS in the caves, like armsy, virginia, the paleskin drones, and those BS babies. Also the current moral of the game is to try as hard as possible NOT to eat people, even though it is the easier thing to do.  P.S. I Still wanna know where fatso stands in all this heirarchy. IMO that big room way deep is concrete proof that virginia is in fact the mutants' ""breeder."" And I guess armsy was just a super-successful mutant?  P.S.S. Maybe fatso is just a man-baby that was super successful? Kinda looks like a larger version of those distorted infants."

TheForest,3dhdks,Jister13,3,Thu Jul 16 08:29:00 2015 UTC,It must be. Those drawings in the cave are the same as those from the plane and there are newer one's. And the natives don't see him as a threat so the chances should be pretty big.
TheForest,3dhdks,iswearatkids,2,Thu Jul 16 08:44:30 2015 UTC,"The only reason that people eat cannibals is because they are easily attainable.  They come to you, forcing you to kill them.

Or maybe he's ruthless and the loss of his son turned him in to more of a monster than the mutants? Is he a hopeful guardian building a failsafe fort for when he maybe, just maybe finds his son again?

Another rule that I force myself to comply with is ""No Combat-Crafting."" I cannot craft ANYTHING while in the heat of combat, and I restrict any weapon swapping because opening my bag should take time as well. Another rule is even if the cannibals insist on chasing you, don't kill them all if you can get away. I don't want to stop any food supply from reaching the mutants in the caves. Which leads me to my last rule: Don't piss off the mutants in the caves. If I get captured by the surface cannibals, I try to stealth my way through all the caves that I can. I sure as hell don't want to deal with them on the surface. I don't ever intentionally go into the caves unless I don't spot any mutants inside.  I think I RP too much, but that is one thing that makes the game enjoyable for me.  Edit: Oh yeah, morbid reminded me that I do ironman as well. It should be an option in the actual game in my opinion."

Have the crafted bow, no arrows, items to craft arrows, and a cloth.  Equip the bow, craft arrows, exit the blanket, then light the ""arrow"" without doing anything else. You are now a firebender.

Right now steam is saying I've clocked 282 hours playing this game since that .4 or .5 patch I started at.        I have seen a ton of improvements since I began! here are some bugs I remember from when I started playing   there were problems where if you had a Molotov in your hand and then selected your axe, the Molotov would explode in your face. That was fun.  For a while the cannibals could hit you and you would fly across the map/and/or when you dismember bodies you would launch into the sky when your axe made contact with the bodies.  The caves first off were extremely buggy at least for me and would not render properly and it was just a bad time.  I wasn't around at the very beginning but for the first couple patches you couldn't even save your game, now you can have multiple saves!  I don't think it's fair to say even with The Forests' glitches and bugs  that it's ever taken a step back. This isn't even the first time the modern axe has been taken out of the game, They've taken things out and added things to better perfect the balance of everything.        The game has made vast improvements such as the bug fixes mentioned above. along with the fixing of bugs their patch notes each patch of things they add are the longest I've seen in any alpha game I play (and alpha games are all i play basically haha)   Just a few things they've added to make our lives easier since I started playing would be the log cart, tree platforms and bridges, the experimental building parts, the ability to hang and dry meat, they've made vast improvements on the cannibals AI and that sorta thing!      I don't think so, they promised multiplayer, they actually said it would be way later in development but we got that. They slowly add more and more hints towards a story every patch.  It's been good       with their countdown on the Forests main menu I'd say they are very persistent with content heavy bug fixing updates. Out of all the alpha games I play I have a lot more faith in the devs behind The Forest than any other games I play.        Truthfully, they've already proven they have the drive to do it, So I am very confident we will see the day this game is finished.       I like the Q and A's they come out with. Maybe in the future we could have maybe screenshots of new areas or items that could serve as ""Teasers"" to get us hyped for each update. But I really have no problem with how they do things. They're a quiet dev team, but they seem very reliable and determined!       Hope this helps you in your review! If you can when you upload it share a link! I'd be happy to watch it!"
TheForest,3dfae8,fireface33,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback! I expect that people who are big fans will likely see more of the good things in the game, while those who aren't too keen on it will point out the downsides, which is good. Both sides are necessary for an informed review.  And for clarification, the ""step back"" is referring to any update that introduced a problem or removed something that felt like the game was downgrading. In 0.19, for example, they removed the Modern Axe. They eventually brought it back, but that still counts as a step back. I've edited the post to clear that up.  You can infer a lot about the devs by looking at when they take steps back, and how long it takes them to recover. For example, this patch (0.2) introduced really bad (and humorous) glitches with building collision. Within 24 hours, they're rolling out a hotfix. That's a step back that was remedied very quickly."
TheForest,3dfae8,NativeKiller,2,Wed Jul 15 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"Since the 0.14 update, about 317 hours? The game is progressing wonderfully, but IMO the graphics were best in the 0.15 version. :D I would say it has nearly evolved into a completely different game! A few glitch fixes they promised here and there, but I believe that they are doing the best they can. :) I say it is making a hell lot of progress! Just compare it with other games still in development! No clue, maybe in 1~2 years? :> Hope they set up a personnel completely dedicated to Q & A, feedback, that kind of thing. I'm not sure if it would be plausible though."

TheForest,3de13g,ERROR372,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:20:30 2015 UTC,Mine is in the middle of a lake watching over my 3 houses of cannibal peasants. It is connected by two rope bridges (one had to have 2 cuz it was too droopy) and a logsled entry foundation bridge to the storage level (there's 4 levels). Logholder-raft made that obsolete though.  It is perfect but for one thing - I can't sleep. Trying to solve this by making it so high that they are all too far away for me not to be able to sleep. Also not enough decorations.  Edit: Though I think a cannabinoid spawned in it once. He wasn't there when I went IN the third floor but as I left he attacked me in the back. Window?

TheForest,3ddbqo,NEM3S1S,2,Wed Jul 15 12:38:39 2015 UTC,"I have some (hopefully constructive) feedback!  Regarding rule 5:   Complaining and criticism are not always useful or necessary as the game is in early development. If you want to voice any complaints, please be constructive, otherwise there is little to no use of it.   ""Constructive criticism"" is a very subjective term, particularly when voiced to a community that doesn't view any critique as acceptable (I live on /r/EliteDangerous, trust me, I know). What one person views as helpful feedback, another might view as harsh criticism. It might be helpful to have some examples of good and bad feedback. Might I propose the following:  Example A - Good feedback   After playing the recent patch, I noticed that mechanic X seems to be a bit broken. For example, <give examples>. Could the developers consider solution Y to fix this?   This feedback is, in my opinion, constructive. It clearly states the problem, gives examples to support the assertion, and offers a solution. The problem might be serious or small, the examples could be rare or common, and the solution may be easy or extravagant. In any case, it provides the developers with a clear outline of the problem, which they can then handle it how they see fit. Also, the professional manner in which the issue is presented is key. Hyperbolic, strongly-worded feedback generally isn't going to be well-received, regardless of content (trust me, I know from experience).  This is the kind of feedback that ought to get upvotes, to better grab the attention of the devs.  Example B - Bad feedback   WTF??!? I logged on today and all my stuff is gone!! Then I had problem A, B, and C. <censored> this <censored> game! WTF!?!!   This is not good feedback. It states a problem, and offers little to no information regarding how the problem occurred, how to replicate it, or what should be done to remedy it. I get it, it's frustrating when things happen that seem beyond your control. But, this game is in early alpha stages. That makes you a QA/Gameplay tester, not a consumer. As such, it's more helpful for you to try to track down how a problem happened, rather than complain that it did. If it's something that was entirely a fluke, or is an inevitable consequence of an update (as some problems are), just remember: At this stage of development, you're a tester, not a gamer.  This is the kind of feedback that you should definitely downvote. While it might merit deletion for being low quality, I'm not one for censorship.  Example C - Mediocre feedback   I'm really sad, guys. The update corrupted my save file, and now I have to start all over again.    This isn't bad feedback in the sense that it's harmful, but more in the sense that it falls into the ""shitpost"" category. Common issues are fairly well-known (updates breaking saves being one). Like I said in the last example, right now, you're a tester, not a gamer. If something upsets you, it's sad, yes, but it's to be expected.  This kind of feedback might spark some useful discussion, so vote as you will. It's not particularly helpful, but it's not harmful, either.    As for my other feedback:  Thank you for the Let's Play rule. Letting the community dictate what we want to see and not see via votes and reports is a very good system.  I just noticed the very clever styling you applied to Night Mode. Well done, not a lot of subs have a working Night Mode. It doesn't seem to always work for me, though. Might be a RES issue. And the subreddit list in the header is hard to see, with light-color text on a light-color background. Not sure if you can affect that, though."

My hardware takes a beating. I build small Micro ATX air cooled machines for ease of transport and space saving on/around my desk. Thus I usually run fairly hot. But I make sure to do regular reapplication of thermal paste on the CPU and GPU every 6 months or so. Currently my CPU never really goes above 65*C and my GPU sees about the same under load I believe. Direct separate intakes for the CPU and GPU with fresh air is important.   Basically what Im saying is that my AMD GPUs have always taken abuse and kept on truckin.

TheForest,3dcve0,PrincessGary,3,Wed Jul 15 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason I avoided the singleplayer as well is I am a massive wimp when it comes to this game, I kept panicking whenever me and my friend saw the mutants/zombies/tribals or whoever ._.

TheForest,3dcve0,Fruit_Salad_,7,Wed Jul 15 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"Start out on the beach with your back to the ocean, and build a tree house. Make a bow and (flaming) arrows, and keep a few meds with you at all times. Also, chop trees while strafing in a circle so cannibals can't sneak up on you.   Pick fights with Mutants every now and then. They quickly become less scary once you're comfortable killing them.  Edit: I like to pretend I'm a grumpy old man trying to keep the little shits off of my property. YOU are the predator, not them. THEY are your food.   Food isn't scary."

The recent version that released tonight made the game a ton more playable then the previous versions, I've had a few FPS drops here and there when the world is rendering, but its been a stable experience.  The only thing that's still buggy or buggy as of now, is the water, sometimes I can walk around underwater, other times I have to swim underwater. Also the caves recently got beautified and patched, so they look better and I haven't been getting caught on the geometry recently."

TheForest,3dcve0,NEM3S1S,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:15:50 2015 UTC,"I have friends who have put in almost a hundred hours into the game, most of that in singleplayer. Personally, I got frustrated after an hour, but kept trucking to seventeen hours in multiplayer. The technical issues in the last patch finally made me give it up for good.  If I were to give an honest opinion, the game has potential, but it's way too early for me to get excited about anything anymore. The content runs out pretty fast, and the game gets old very quickly unless you're playing with friends, in which case, prepare to deal with a mountain of glitches and other issues.  If you stopped because you're frustrated, my advice is to stay away for a while longer. Old issues have been resolved, to be replaced with new ones. Perhaps in a year, it'll be in a less frustrating state, so it might behoove you to wait until then.  For me, the kicker was the third BSOD I got while hosting a server. When I brought it up to the community, the response was ""Stop overclocking"". If I have to adjust my BIOS settings to play a single game, then to me, that game is not worth playing."

TheForest,3ddbgq,lewisj489,4,Wed Jul 15 11:14:37 2015 UTC,"The issue with sleeping in multiplayer eventually boils down to day and night being unique to each player. This could definitely impact how mutants act, seeing as they are more hostile at night versus during the day.  That being said, the devs could be considering an alternative such as an alert that goes out to all players if somebody in-game wants to sleep. They would be able to acknowledge that it's time for bed and join the rest of the players. Once they are all ""readied-up"" so to speak, then sleeping would occur. Of course everybody would be woken up if natives become hostile in the middle of the night. Just my $0.02."

These may be present in SP as well, I'm not sure.  -Client is unable to save their game.  On every re-load you start out in the plane with starting inventory.  Host is unaffected. -Throwing a weak spear turns into an upgraded spear when you pick it up. -Spears are destroyed when they kill an animal.  Not sure if that's technically a bug but seems like it. -There are still invisible animals, unfortunately that was not completely fixed."

Anyway, after a long while of chopping trees, I finish up my tree house and cut the tree that supported it. What I didn't know(quite stupid of me, I know) was that you were supposed to put the building plan down and then you cut the tree.   So I'm sitting there, chastising myself for being so retarded when all of a sudden 2 people dropped down in front of me from nearby trees(I cut trees as far as I could from where I was planning to build my floating village so I would have enough trees to make it as big as I like) I looked at them for a bit and then I heard more thumping noises from behind me. I turn around and there's two more of these guys that fell from 2 other trees. And I hear more thumping noises, and more thumping noises and soon enough I'm surrounded by a dozen of these guys that just strategically camped in the trees I was saving to build a base for God only knows how long.   Long story short, they beat my ass and threw me in a cave and I stopped playing for a while.  That's when I knew I loved this game because I've never seen any AI like that in any game I've played."

The thing that I'm concerned about now is what the story would look like assuming we find the son. I would almost have to imagine a rescue situation for both if we find him, since I doubt he's just going to follow us around in our effort to survive.

I also had one Armsie surprise me, my first Armsie encounter, where he managed to knock down a couple of walls, so maybe the AI just doesn't prefer getting sand in their feet?"
TheForest,3d3kba,bunnybearlover,2,Mon Jul 13 07:02:35 2015 UTC,"That is quite odd especially since you're on the beach. Since you said cliff,  I assume it's the one with the dead sharks. I had my first big base there. It was my favorite but I had to abandon it because they were always there. Once they got so aggro shouting at the top of the cliff they tumbled down and got trapped inside. We could barely run to the suitcases for supplies. I want good at killing they then so it was extra hard for me. I've never seen more than 2 of the big mutants at a time though. They sometimes come with 5 or 6 in their group and if there's more than one group it can be almost impossible.   From what I've noticed is pretty random. Some people get attacked more than others.  I think you just got lucky. Be glad you can go out and build/gather supplies during the day without worrying."

TheForest,3d1wg5,back_tohell,5,Sun Jul 12 21:20:00 2015 UTC,It's easier to kill them with a bow. Before you shoot press L to light the arrow on fire.  You can kill quite a few like this.   There are some good tips on the sub for getting feathers too.   Make sure you build defensive walls around your base. They can damage them but only the giant creepy ones can knock them down.
TheForest,3d1wg5,bunnybearlover,2,Sun Jul 12 21:52:29 2015 UTC,"Just note that each fire arrows needs 1 cloth (Automatically combined when you press L to lit the arrow), so use it wisely."
TheForest,3d1wg5,ShiroNiKuma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:23:51 2015 UTC,A few minutes ago I was attacked by 4 natives.  One managed to knock on side off of the platform between me and my fort!  I ran over it anyway and then jumped off and got him with a fire arrow; then climbed up the rope to my tree site.  He just yelled and bashed it down in fewer than 10 blows.
TheForest,3d1wg5,dahni194,3,Tue Jul 14 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"My best friend is my upgraded stick. Hit it up with 15 feathers then wrap it in cloth, light with your lighter and you can take down 4 or 5 of those hungry bastards in a few swings.  Be warned though that the cloth will burn off and you'll have to rewrap it.  It's faster than an axe and a lot of the time you don't even have to swing it, the will just run into it and light themselves on fire."

TheForest,3d1wg5,officers3xy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"Bow and fire arrow.  Collect feathers and sticks and cloths(from suitcases or villages).  Light arrow as bunnybear says.  Practice this!  Shoot from a distance, back away or go to one side; shoot again.  Run when they get closer because this is a slow process!  Practice changing the bow for the axe or Molotov and vice versa.  Did I say be ready to Sprint/Run?"

TheForest,3d4o4l,Rolink,3,Mon Jul 13 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"The only way that I could see something like this working is if as you chopped trees you learned better technique so you could chop it faster.  As you build stuff you could learn and then build better structures.  As you shot your bow and arrow you would get more and more accurate, practice makes perfect.  But a leveling system isn't in tune with the story of being stranded.  Its not a RolePlay game.  Its survival.  It would be nice to be able to increase stamina by running more or stuff like that.    But a point leveling system doesnt fit  *I will admit though that I would rather them working on many other things before this. *"
TheForest,3d4o4l,Jister13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"I can think of plenty of games in the survival genre that have level up systems that work just fine. Kill things, collect things, etc., get XP, put into skill point categories like better stamina, more health, faster running, etc."

For that matter, even Minecraft has an XP system.   I don't really care if it becomes a part of this game or not, but the reason won't be ""because it's a survival game."""
TheForest,3d4o4l,blankster22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, I would rather have it go the other way; to a more realistic environment for the survivor to live, and search for Timmy in.  I understand that you can buy a cheat that gives you 'god mod' powers.  Then you can run and gun forever instead of having to think and plan and sometimes fight and most times run.  I hope the idea that this is a horror survival game does not change."
TheForest,3d4o4l,dahni194,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:10:55 2015 UTC,Minecraft's XP systems is far different from any other.  And they implemented it because they felt the community needed it.  The dev's had reached a point where they couldn't figure out what else to add to the game without changing the gameplay.
TheForest,3d0tz8,Questionable-Methods,4,Sun Jul 12 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"I've been at my base in the snow for a few days.  Attacks slowly built up to the point that I had as many as 5 different contacts per day. I'm talking 3-6 members in each group with Virginia along 1-2 times each day.  I finally ran out of booze and bombs and food so decided to make a run to my other base on the island just off the beach where the 3 containers are sitting.  I could only find 4 booze bottles, but enough digital units for 5 more bombs.  So I went down the beach to the loot area by the rowboat.  I have a tree platform nearby, plus a couple of tree bridges and  small custom foundation platform.  I managed to get one lizard before the swarms hit!  I was surrounded for 2 days and nights by mutants plus either Virginia or the other monster.  I had managed to get 4 more booze bottles, so had 8 molotovs.  Used them all,  mostly on Virginia, and she was still alive when I got away.  Used bombs on the other monster but did not seem to hurt it!  Used up everything including about 50 fire arrows.  Then I ran out of sticks and cloths, so no more fire arrows.  Finally got a break and got to my raft and then to my island fort.  Luckily I have a small cache of food, water, sticks and logs here.  But no booze, so no more molotovs or bombs until I can make a shore run.  Do ya think they are going to swim to my island?  Or just walk across?  I have no time to look for Timmy clues; I'm not likely to survive when I have to return to the beach area for supplies....."
TheForest,3d0tz8,dahni194,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:31:13 2015 UTC,Last time I tried to make an island base (thinking I was so clever at the time) they ran right across the ocean floor and fucked my shit up. They were already agro'd when I tried to swim to safety so maybe if the island is far enough away it would be different?
TheForest,3d0tz8,Tagger24,2,Mon Jul 13 00:57:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you don't aggro them and they don't recognize that you are there, they won't patrol into your location.  ...Unless, they somehow glitch-spawn around your location, but that doesn't happen very often. (Thank God)"
TheForest,3d0tz8,NativeKiller,3,Mon Jul 13 08:02:05 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, staying quiet for awhile, as in, not cutting down trees and not killing natives will eventually return their aggro levels to the normal level. :D"

TheForest,3d0tz8,Hayras90,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:24:33 2015 UTC,In my experience they will follow you and set up patrol routes wherever you go on the island. If you build high up in the snowy mountains they won't be able to bother you but they will still spawn/come to the nearest place beside the mountain.
TheForest,3d0tz8,Headcrabhat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"Chances are that cannibal you killed wasn't alone. They work as such: One member of a group you encounter might be sent to run away and tell the island about you unless he or she dies. The first encounter you have with the cannibals, they are smart about it and don't take any chances, and will probably send someone off the second hostility from either side begins. From that point on, they know the location of where they fought you last, which may or may not be your base. Moving should not change their minds as they would not know you are in a new area and they would continue combing your previous location."

I get a stuttering look to the raft when traveling which has no real impact on movement but I did have a minor issue in one area where the raft just decided it wasn't going to float and was going to be a land yacht. I just pushed it into deeper water and it started floating again.  No problems building on the raft though.

Truthfully, seeing them spammed lately makes me never want to watch them."

TheForest,3cnknk,JamesHVT,7,Fri Jul 10 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, the lets players don't understand that what they're doing is bad for them as well. For those who don't know, there is a factor called audience retention which is the average percentage people watch of your video, higher is better.     Every click the video gets, it gets one view, people who don't use analytics will assume views translates to popularity and will think ""this is great it gets free views"" and will disregard any rules and continue posting without realising that they have 2% audience retention and a couple dislikes. Because of the dislikes anyone else who stumbles across the video will see the dislikes and assume it's shit and abandon the video.   People who monetize (put ads on for all that youtube dosh (Very little anyway)) think that views translate to money from ad views but forget that their video has 4 ads in it only one will get viewed, also reddit has a higher percentage of ad block use.  In both situations you're not improving anything.    There are better ways to get views from reddit, what I do is I make my video, take some screenshots of various parts of it which might interest the sub, throw them into an imgur album and put a link to the video down at the end. By doing this I generate content for the sub that sometimes people like, and actual views for me because the people who click the link are actually interested in the content.    Another way to get views is to make educational/guide like content. Take /u/JamesHVT for example, he works stuff into his lets plays like locations and helpful tips, like I'd never have thought of using platforms and rope as an entry to a base  TL;DR Git gud scrubs use your analytics and better techniques  Edit: some grammar"
TheForest,3cnknk,decaxon,3,Thu Jul 9 11:52:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, thank you for posting this and recognizing what I'm aiming to do.   I personally cant stand ""lets play"" videos and when I started recording and posting here I unfortunately fell into that category. Once I realized the error of my ways I altered my videos to be more educational, like you said. I've been trying to remember what tripped me up when I first started and address those issues I personally had, hence my horribly drawn maps lol.   If I ever do make a Lets Play for the Forest or anything else I wouldn't post it here cause like you said, this reddit isn't here for that. As it is I feel weird posting the videos I make because I always fear at any moment I'll have overstayed my welcome and this community is awesome and upsetting this community is the last thing I would want to do.   I have noticed that there have been a lot more of those lets play videos popping up so I'm gonna stop posting my videos directly and take your advice, posting the images and having the link through imgur."
TheForest,3cnknk,ShiroNiKuma,2,Thu Jul 9 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"I've been taking some of your advice too, I used your rope entry idea but instead of a tree I used a platform as cannibals can't climb them and it also has a little pier for fishing and rafts. Also I robbed your idea of having your own map for a video to draw on without really realising it, I have a tablet so I thought it'd be fun to doodle on a map, turned out decent. I'm trying to make mine more educating but right now the only tip I can really give is don't put a fire on a raft with anything that attracts birds lest your raft go the way of the Titanic. But yea great videos."

TheForest,3coz92,GSKashmir,11,Thu Jul 9 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm hoping it doesn't go that direction.  The very low limit we can upgrade our weapons to (five fire arrows to kill legsy, and 10 to kill armsy) tells me we're supposed to live in fear.  Since v.14 there are probably three times more natives.  I'm looking for more survival challenges, like the need to craft shoes and other essentials in a constantly hostile world.  The addition of thirst and having stamina drain more realistic gives me hope it's becoming a survival game, not a leveler with an actual ending."
TheForest,3coz92,catharticwhoosh,3,Thu Jul 9 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"I dont think the games is going to the ""Final Boss"" direction. The only possible end I see is to rescue your son (or just find if he's dead) and find a way out. Probably you are just going to need survival tactics to get there or the task to gather stuff until you can rescue him. Maybe you will even need to survive a certain amount of days to get your next ""hint"".  Maybe the Giant Hole might be some kind of clue at some moment or something that triggers an action, like you throw something and natives get more aggresive but that leads you to discover new stuff.  Other possible end is that the game never actually shows you the son, but you just have to continue surviving, and for that reason, devs are just going to keep updating stuff you can do while at the island. (This is less probable because of the size of the island which is pretty limited and the stong attach the community has with ""Finding Timmy"")"
TheForest,3coz92,ShiroNiKuma,3,Thu Jul 9 21:30:14 2015 UTC,"They certainly seem to hint that there's something big lurking under the ground.  In the cave with the giant door, once you pick the cross up off the ground, you can hear a very deep rumbling sort of moaning sound.

TheForest,3coz92,NativeKiller,3,Thu Jul 9 21:55:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you threw out the final boss thing and made it so that thing was just down there in the sink hole and you could see it, I would be so happy.  I see the theory of there being a hidden underground lab and I'm like ""No!  Don't do that, there's so many references to some sort of cult and the fact that these things are birthed and not created.""

TheForest,3cj5ql,Aj_The_Wanderer,3,Thu Jul 9 06:22:06 2015 UTC,"After finally building a base, becoming the scourge of the native once more, and generally becoming Armageddon on two legs...  I just want more caves to explore and maybe more lore-bits. I don't really know what I want at this point, I haven't gotten deep enough into the meta-game that I don't know what mechanics, buffs, nerfs or anything like that I want.  But something that caught my eye back in .17 kinda has me wondering. Okay so near that island that's right next to the mountains (it has the clearing and the two camps on it); if you go on the southern(?) part of the island, you'd have seen four or six trees coming out of the water there. It makes me wonder if it was just a bug or if they have another island planned for that area. I mean the map is filled with enough water to where it wouldn't surprise me if they added a ""mainland"" or another sizable island to the game.  Its kinda my theory that once you get to the Mountain and do whats required there (save Timmy?) you enter into a end-game phase. Where you do one of three things, either A. You find a way for you and Timmy to get off the island. B. You chose to live on the island and try to coexist with the mostly hostile population. Or C. You realize that your wife is probably not going to let you have Timmy after this ordeal, so you decide to kill all the cannibals and cleanse the island. So you can have your son all to yourself.  Okay that last one is mostly a joke, but I don't think rescuing Timmy will end the game right there. There's still the problem of getting him off the island, or you choosing to stay on the island."

Perhaps a tanning rack with drying/prep time before they can be used so you have to plan ahead.  But shoes should be essential. *Areas of the island that you absolutely would not dare go with our available arsenal.  It is far too easy to raid the main camps because they're sparsely populated. *Like /u/cr4ve said, reduced animal population.  When food runs low you should have to go on hunting excursions to fill up. *Allow deer skins for armor (see tanning) because right now the currency of the game is the lizard skin. *Change the ridiculous requirement to poke a tree to get just 2 or 3 leaves. *Dried meat shouldn't lose most of its nutritional value between game saves or days spent away from the drying rack.  The meat should just be harder to come by, not useless once you do finally get it and preserve it. *A mushroom collection bag. *Health damage or just instant thirst from poison berries or mushrooms.

The second part seems to indicate that they are trying a variety of ways to increase normal births for the tribe; from appeasing the Gods to trying other Gods, hence the Bibles and crosses.

If it turns out that you cannot play it properly now, consider a future investment :)  The game's visual rendering will eventually be optimized to run on most pcs.

In most cases, you will be able to run nearly any game, however it being playable is an entire other situation. And while you may consider nothing less than 30 FPS on ultra acceptable, others may be happy with 20 FPS on the minimum setting.  That being said, it will probably be unplayable (very low fps) on your card on ultra. It does look like you should be able to play it just fine on medium settings probably, depending on what your standards are. As u/Jister13 implied, as the game progresses into beta and an eventual full release, it will likely begin to run better for you as well. I'd say it's worth it still for such a great game that only costs $15."

TheForest,3c35n7,NativeKiller,6,Sat Jul 4 08:46:31 2015 UTC,"One idea I've always had is that the cannibals on the surface sort of worship the mutants in the caves fearfully. First of all, one thing to get clear is that the pale-skinned mutant people in the cave are a completely different strain of people from the cannibals on the surface due to their animal tendencies and their much greater strength. When pale-skins come to the surface after you, as the player, have made yourself known to them, they do actually fight with the cannibals. And win, a lot. I have seen one lone pale-skin take down two surface cannibals, each with a club. And then it chased off the rest of the tribe. This leads me to my point. The surface cannibals dumping you, and most likely all of those other poor people hanging from the ceiling, is their way of keeping those pale-skins and even the larger mutants INSIDE the caves. A steady food source coming in, why would they want to leave? They keep all of the heads though, that is what they use on their effigies. And the island's supposed ""Bermuda"" effect bringing in such a steady supply of foreign people, the surface cannibals don't have to worry too much about their subterranean neighbors. Obviously they are cannibals themselves because they're on an island and, hey, it's food. Might also be their form of burial, as they don't seem to eat outsiders too often but will eat either a dead starving cannibal or a dead family member. Anyways, another theory I've had is that the mutants down in the caves actually have no idea that there are people living on the surface. Because, the second you make yourself known to them they are like: ""Hey, wait, that meatsack was moving, let's investigate"" and then they come to the surface and see food-a-plenty in the form of cannibals and you. I think they come to the surface if you kill a lot of surface cannibals as well, because the food supply has stopped.  Sorry this post was long, but I hope it was a nice read."

My transcription is very fragmented, I'll try get a better screenshot of the note page Here's what I got so far:    Feminan quatta or brura (Ilegible) OBLITER UVESCO CALLOSUS. Pallide con plesiones. Ill n erris. Profenda hen i depressas. Quidanis fanies n ordes sont. Non AUNCULUS oh aracieres. Lire infao les prefes, seabasa (Ilegible) CRUCIS non prosunt. Pedioas operaberis es non no gauin as faciem V us suis cabilo s DELENIFICUS no life.    The straight google translate of it: Four female or Bruri (Ilegible) I forgot MOIST SKIN. Pale with plesiones. Ill N risk. Profenda Hen I depressed. For some houses n order sont. Oh, not uncle aracieres. Infant lire les prefer seabass (Ilegible) Cross did not help. Pedioas labor are not as open no Gavin 5 Us and cable's SEDUCTIVE no Life     Pretty much gibberish My take on it is this is a report about our dear friend Virginia and the other mutants. From using google translate it originally said the opening line was ""Woman has 4 (Untranslated)"" Could be breasts as Virginia has 4 breasts. So it says The woman has 4 breasts, moist and pale skin with something I couldn't read. Ill a risk could mean Illness is a risk. I believe Profenda could be Professor and this could be some sort of expedition, The professor is depressed.    Next it speaks of houses in order, obviously referring to the cannibal bases. Something about an uncle, I doubt aracieres is a word or name and I'm probably wrong with that. The way it says ""Oh, not"" leads me to believe that this uncle may be dead. Next it talks about an infant, lire means to read, maybe it's reading? It says about preferring seabass, a type of fish, so either I messed up the transcript or they eat seabass.    This is pretty much the only legible line I managed to get and it is the creepiest. The cross did not help. So the author has been keeping his cross with him in the hopes that God will keep him safe, which it hasn't.    The last 2 lines are almost illegible, but I think it is talking about labour, a guy called Gavin and that there is 5 of them, probably the writer, Gavin, the Professor, the Infant and the Uncle. The word that translated to seductive also means soothing on its own."

I'll link the video after it finishes processing but I couldn't agree more.    I could totally understand if the cannibals see the trap and avoid it, that would make sense but I've also had them walk or run right up to it and it goes off and they aren't phased at all. I have no data on the matter but I'd say a 20% kill rate would be a very reasonable estimate.     Granted, it looks really cool when it does work as intended but it would be nice if they upped the kill rate even to 40% but ideally 50%-60% considering it will only kill one cannibal at a time anyway and you would have to be there to reset personally.    I thought about this a little during the video but didn't bring it up, what do you think of a camouflage addition to the Birthday trap? Was thinking it would be pretty cool if the trap could be placed and once built and armed you could press ""E"" on it again to add leaves to it with a generic animation that would take roughly 4 seconds. It shouldn't be instant cast so you couldn't reset and re-camo the trap during combat. The addition of the leaves to the trap could up its kill rate for that initial kill."

TheForest,3bqhh2,bunnybearlover,3,Wed Jul 1 11:23:15 2015 UTC,"In my experience, they can't walk up the path. Also, you can sprint-jump into the back side of some of them, but again, the natives can't."

TheForest,3bpjo7,NativeKiller,5,Wed Jul 1 03:00:20 2015 UTC,You have so much shit... Haha.  I just have one question though. How in the world do you catch fish? I'm honestly starting to think fish just didn't download in my game files. I know it requires the weak spear and a pond. Past that I'm evidently an idiot.
TheForest,3bpjo7,blankster22,4,Wed Jul 1 03:13:09 2015 UTC,"Some ponds(not all!) have fish swimming in it.  You just grab your weak spear then stabby stab the fish with it to make yourself a fish kebab! :D    Yeah, I pretty much always try to keep my inventory to the max.  It somehow makes me feel more secure. (LOL)"
TheForest,3bpjo7,Aj_The_Wanderer,3,Wed Jul 1 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"Also I have a question, where do you find a spear. I always thought that crafting it using: [Stick+ax+stone+rope] made sense, since you'd sharpen the stick with the ax, use the stone as a tip, and use rope to tie it together.  But when I read the wiki, it said it spawns at ponds. But is that even true anymore? The wiki and wikia are so out-of-date that they're borderline useless in the current versions."
TheForest,3bpjo7,Aj_The_Wanderer,5,Wed Jul 1 06:43:56 2015 UTC,The Weak Spear can still be found nearby some of the ponds. :D

TheForest,3bpjo7,BUTCHER_206,2,Wed Jul 1 07:04:52 2015 UTC,"So the ponds that you can fish have visible fish in them? I feel like I've checked way too many ponds to not see fish swimming in any of them. I guess also to note, do you actually stab at the fish itself, or just randomly into a pond that has fish in it and every now and then you get one?  I know this is a little ranty but I've seriously felt so stupid for many hours because of this."
TheForest,3bpjo7,BUTCHER_206,4,Wed Jul 1 03:31:20 2015 UTC,You can find fish in some ponds and in some shallow areas off the beaches. Look carefully and you'll be able to see them swimming around from the shore. Equip your spear and move in pretty close to the fish and click to stab. Up comes the fish on your spear and then you press E to put it into your inventory. you can even do it from a raft. Just like real life :D
TheForest,3bpjo7,BrissyAussie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:45:40 2015 UTC,"Find a pond/beach side that has visible fish in it. Actually stab the fish itself with the Weak Spear(might take a few tries per fish, they are slippery bastards) Obtain Fish Kebab ??? Profit!"

Then I wandered over to the mountains cause they were gorgeous. It got dark and I tried to set up camp in a fishing lodge thing with a ramp, went to grab some sticks to finish my shelter and came back to 5 cannibals who stayed there the entire night. So about 48 hours wandering aimlessly and hiding in bushes from cannibals lol (still trying to figure out windows movie maker / making webm's and stuff, i'll upload some stuff eventually!)"

TheForest,3bqz2l,Jister13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:22:11 2015 UTC,"Also, seeing as CoOp saving doesn't work as you would imagine a server of this type is not viable (at least currently).  If the server owner forgets to save before shutting down the server you will have lost all your progress but your inventory would remain the same.  So, lets say you joined the server and built some shelves, rock holders, stick holders, and log holders.  Then filled them all with stuff.  You saved and the server owner saved.  Then you logged on and took all the sticks/rocks/shelf items (a ton of meds and food perhaps).   You saved and get off for the day.  Now the server owner shut down the server without saving.  He restarts it and you log on the next day.  You will have all those meds/food in your inventory and still on your shelves."
TheForest,3bqz2l,Jister13,2,Wed Jul 1 13:27:24 2015 UTC,"...?  I'm sorry but I really don't get your point. :D  If everyone keeps their inventory then Trading would actually be useful right?

TheForest,3bqz2l,TeachMeShrimp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:43:09 2015 UTC,Exploiting the storage is exactly my point.  If you could just create money then why work for it?

TheForest,3bqz2l,dahni194,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"I would go with berries since they have a good inherent value due to being an item that can replenish both hunger and thirst.  Arrows can be gathered fairly easily if you just stay on the beach and kill seagulls, do I feel like that could get excessive. Plus, while they are useful for combat, you don't really need to store that many since they're limited by cloth.  Overall, I think they risk losing value quickly.  Cloth is an option since it's flexible in use and provides vital protection.  As for teeth, it's a fun idea since it encourages actively hunting cannibals, but that doesn't actually reduce threats in this game and they'll be more aggressive :p"
TheForest,3bqz2l,dahni194,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"Cloth is flexible indeed but I got the idea that they might a be a bit 'too easy' to obtain. :D  Teeth might also serves a good currency, if it became more useful! ;)"

Chambers, first published by F. Tennyson Neely in 1895.  The book is named after a fictional play with the same title which recurs as a motif through some of the stories.  The first half of the book features highly esteemed weird stories, and the book has been described by critics such as E. F. Bleiler, S. T. Joshi and T. E. D. Klein as a classic in the field of the supernatural.   There are ten stories, the first four of which, ""The Repairer of Reputations"", ""The Mask"", ""In the Court of the Dragon"" and ""The Yellow Sign"", mention The King in Yellow, a forbidden play which induces despair or madness in those who read it.

When I say thin, I mean about the width of the stick on a standing torch or effigy, and you have to make sure it's a spot where the ground is even so the wall pieces won't lean away from each other and create a gap.  Plus I save frequently, so I'm the type of person who would probably just reload if something weird like that happens.  I remember being able to load a log holder straight through he wall too, but that was probably a glitch so I never actively tried doing it."

The Island itself is so diverse, the caves are really threatening and there will be so much more in the future I think..

TheForest,3bm757,bunnybearlover,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:16:10 2015 UTC,We've seen them in co-op but rarely and usually just after a big fight or wandering alone on the new map. They used to only attack the host but they fixed that now.   In single player they seem to come much more often.
TheForest,3bm757,dahni194,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"I got caught out after dark about an hour ago.  Luckily I had build an Alpine tree house with a platform and tree bridge so I could protect my system a little.  I had all kinds of people yelling at me and fighting each other and it was dark and raining and I was being told that I was wet and freezing and, and....  then I heard a thumping and the platform the tree bridge was attached to disappeared!  I was on the porch with fire arrow and got a good shot at a 6 legged lady.  One shot and she/it thrashed around a little and then died.  Usually it takes several fire arrows and several molotovs!  Turns out I had 4 arrows left, and only one stick!  I used all my molotovs and forgot that one end of the tree bridge had no connection!  I walked out to the end before seeing this, but the bridge didn't fall.  Really weird, and even more scary.  Anyway!! armsy then showed up on the beach and finally came up to the fight.  Again, 1 fire arrow took him/it out.  Since I only had one more arrow and no molotovs I was petty happy.  I think I killed one mutant with a Molotov.  The others would hide under the tree bridge or under the house, or dodge the molotovs!!!  This is getting more scary.  I can have 16 molotovs total, but mutants have learned to dodge!"

TheForest,3bhaba,OdinValk,2,Mon Jun 29 22:18:09 2015 UTC,I haven't played since 0.13 but... I built a place by the water at the base of the cliffs where they parted and made a little valley...  Not far from crash site... But hardly any mutants ever bothered me there...  I built another place by the boat...  Needless to say it was much more active
TheForest,3bhaba,Grimus22,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:28:57 2015 UTC,Yea I've noticed that the beach is a high traffic area for mutants! I'm trying now to find a location to build on the new side of the map but I used to always build by the boat as well on the beach! Pretty good area.
TheForest,3bhaba,FishyJoeJr,3,Mon Jun 29 05:30:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I avoid the beach as much as possible.  pretty much a primary route for mutants at any time of day/night.

TheForest,3bdmf2,Errose,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"There are other bugs too but thanks for this one.   A bug I have found is the cannibal patrol routes get reset after a load. Cannibal patrol routes generally progress in patterns across the islands. If you save the game when cannibals are approaching your base with their non alert patrol, then leave and reload, the patrol is no longer there and all the patrols are reset back to the first route again which they then progress through. This even works to get rid of the ultra mutated cannibals Virginia and Arms.  Eventually the patrols will progress back up through the escalating responses and patrols until they are back to where they were before, but this bug is still annoying, and also makes the game too easy even if you intentionally do not even exploit the bug but also minimize your reloading."

I would love more transparency in what you are doing with the game as often as possible, not just a countdown in-game as to when we can expect the next patch. That timer doesn't build hype for your game or the next patch unless you spoil us a little bit sometimes, it only marks for how long we can keep our current bases and/or tells us of imminent doom. So no matter how you view the timer, it does everything it wasn't supposed to and leaves out the one thing it should do - build hype and keep people interested.    When I first saw this game I was hooked right from the start. After fooling around for 25 hours or so, I am already beginning to lose interest. A damn shame considering the potential you have here with this game. I want to love this game I really do, but it's like when you keep sending messages to some hot chick and the only reply you are getting is ""Seen 15.29"", then all of a sudden she starts sending messages again after about say 17 days or so (maybe even nudes). Then it's back to silence again, and we have been left with shattered dreams and hopes once again. This leaves us in a spot where we can either choose to play along with her games but never commit or try to forget about her all together and forget we ever met. Then maybe one day she will be ready for the world to see, and hopefully the community surrounding her is still big enough to explode and drag even more in for her to seduce. This game is that girl, and that girl is your spark to ignite all this gunpowder that is the community, but not if you don't plug all the holes in the barrels first (and let us know when/how/why you do it while you are at it!).  What I'm trying to say is that your game is very good at capturing people's attention briefly, you need to improve keeping their attention or you are suffocating the playerbase slowly but surely. :<  Still I must give credit where it's due - What you have accomplished so far is really impressive and there are many cool ideas already and that is awesome. :D I gotta admit that this is one of the very few games I have felt a deep need to help improve because of its potential and because I want to see it as perfect/good as possible, and my gaming career reaches back 25 years now. I doubt I'm the only one after lurking around this subreddit for some time now, so please let me(us!) help you to make it so! :D.    .. hopefully the modern axe is found soon enough though, unfortunately fewer and fewer of us can continue to be arsed with searching when we are searching in complete darkness :v"

I feel like we may have been hoodwinked."
TheForest,3bdbom,Jellersen,3,Mon Jun 29 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, why people are downvoting us is beyond me. I guess the truth is not always as good to hear as one would like. In the end it doesn't mean anything or has an effect on our opinions and what we wrote, so let 'em downvote all they want imo :v    We gotta keep in mind that the devs are a very small team, so we should cut them some slack still (but only some) if we hear from them in this regard. That shows they are listening, and in my book that is a start.  I too haven't played this game since the last update, there's not really a point and there is nothing to look forward to unfortunately. If you haven't seen it already, there is a game called Subnautica that I think you might enjoy as much as I have for a long time now. The devs are very transparent, and you can follow their progress/stuff they do each day from hour to hour at places such as their trello or other sites really easy.

TheForest,3bc1gm,Moloshe,0,Sat Jun 27 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"Also try verifying your files.  I had weird problems for a bit until I did that.  I will say, there are definitely some weird bugs introduced in the newest patch.  For instance, I can create and save a world on my desktop computer.  When I got to work, I was actually able to load that save from the Steam Cloud.  When I got home, however, none of the progress I made had been saved from work.  I definitely saved it too.  So there may be some odd disconnect with the Steam servers and saving at the moment.  Try to keep in mind it's an alpha build.  I don't know how refunds work with early access games but yeah, it's an early access game.  Don't expect anything to work correctly, you're being naive if you do.  The devs allow us to play the game in its current state as a favor to us.  They don't need to do that."
TheForest,3bc1gm,wrayvinmane,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"another thing to keep in mind is that the game is about survival and exploration. you can build a base and its important to get the modern axe or the climbing axe, rebreather, cassette tapes etc, but the majority of the items, weapons, and structures you make are entirely disposable and replaceable. if you really want to immerse yourself in the game, you will create a series of small shelters across the island as you explore, so in my experience losing a save really doesnt cause too much of a problem unless you've built a huge structure. that type of project is cool and i do it a lot, but it's not necessary nor is it really very effective, because larger structures draw more attention and the mutants can knock down your stuff in this update.  what you want to do is learn how to coexist with them for as long as possible in order to find timmy or figure out whats going on etc, not to clear cut an area and make an impenetrable fort, which is the only unique thing you'd miss when losing a save."
TheForest,3bc1gm,PROJ3CTA,0,Sat Jun 27 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"Having the same issue. I just bought it today. My friend and I were playing multiplayer and he hosted. He was able to save but I didn't get an option. Then I played solo and it gave me slots to save but when loading they were not there, or they were there once and then not there the next time. Also, lost my red axe while lifting logs and couldn't get it back. When I tried to reload the game the file wasn't there."
TheForest,3bc1gm,PROJ3CTA,0,Sun Jun 28 05:37:33 2015 UTC,The way I was able to fix this was to exit to windows instead of the main menu. It seems to work every time. I haven't had a problem since.

When a native tries to enter you base, set the Fire Pit on fire, and BLAM! Complete shutdown! ;)  The humanoids will be killed by the fire while the 'bigger friends' won't be able to fit through the narrow entrance of the container box! ;)  Or you could just build a base right after entering a ground level cave entrance.

They have little red X's on them so i went to each location i had available to see what they were referencing, they seem to be guiding you to those dirt mounds you can blow up. So ive been doing that for the past 2 hours hoping for an Axe but all i keep finding is junk. watches and ropes and always a skull.  Oh, And  noticed the online Map is actually sideways from the in game map.  I saved a copy of it and rotated it on its side and now navigating with the compass makes sense.  And yes, the sun rises and sets completely wrong lol"
TheForest,3b8kxt,Grimus22,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"For me the compass is wrong, cause its simple logic, sun goes from east to west.

Btw, all this has been on ""Veganmode"", cause I cant stand caves in SP, I already get claustrophobic when I cant find the exit and start running around like there is no tomorrow. And this are something I found out:   Compass points South where the Beach is... So the Sun comes out from South to North lol Some of the Map X show lead to a rock with the bomb symbol. Modern Axe might have been move to the newest cave, Cave 7, in the other island. Cave 3 still has NO-Cannibals inside, so its an easy way to get the climbing axe (Went on multiplayer) Also, in Cave 1 or 2, there a HUGE pit where you see the letter I hovering. You need the Climbing Axe to get down. I didnt have it in this adventure so I couldnt go down. However, be careful. While I was in MP, I went a little down and then up cause my friends didnt have the axe and it glitched at the top and fell down and died. Couldnt see what was in there. It might be the modern axe... Who knows? lol It has a Skull with shiny eyes on the top btw."

Just have defence ready and a lookout.  I can still get work done in a multiplayer game at night.  I don't like to sleep as it wastes perfectly good game time.

Sick of cannibals breaking through your base? Defensive walls are now a lot more secure and only destroyable by the larger distorted creatures.  Save slots have been added! so you’re no longer limited to a single save file. We also added some cool new usable items (Compass, torn map!) Balanced caves with a new variation of enemy (skinny pale) Added new art, new underwater visuals, fixed a bunch of multiplayer and single player bugs and much more, all listed below:  As always, please continue to post your bug reports and feedback in the Discussions area of the Community Hub  v0.19 Changelog:  (multiplayer) Fixed some cases of creepy mutants not targeting remote players correctly  (multiplayer) Increased priority of mutants, making them smoother/less laggy  (multiplayer) Fixed issues with log sled after loading a saved multiplayer game  (multiplayer) Typing in chat no longer triggers in game actions  (multiplayer) Fixed chatbox being locked when input loses focus  (multiplayer) Fire now spreads/replicates  (multiplayer) Rope is now buildable  (multiplayer) Players will now appear as the correct body type/clothing for everyone  (multiplayer) Game invites are now properly queued  (multiplayer) Clients now have a different save per server and respawn after loading where they saved instead of in plane (respawn after dying is still located in plane)  (multiplayer) Fixed a bug with experimental stairs in saved games which could cause issues for clients loading  (multiplayer) Added message when alt tabbing as host to warn about risks of disconnecting clients  (multiplayer) Fixed issues where dead bodies would sometimes not replicate correctly  (multiplayer) Fixed bug where modern axe would appear as old yellow axe to other players  (multiplayer) Fixed bug where killed turtles would give infinite shells and no meat for client players  You can now toggle the color of stick markers (SP only)  Fixed Stick Marker flying above floor (not retro active)  Fixed several tree structures which did not properly save which tree they are built on (not retro active)  Fixed tree structures not getting destroyed when their attached tree is found cut down after loading a saved game  It is now possible to build small structures (like log holders ;) on top of rafts !

TheForest,3azhos,OdinValk,2,Wed Jun 24 19:26:20 2015 UTC,And I think you DO want to destroy theirs
TheForest,3azhos,OdinValk,2,Wed Jun 24 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"Effigies frighten natives work best while alight during the day. At night natives tend to show in larger groups and are bolder, and might ignore your effigies altogether.  However, since the AI reacts according to how many structures/etc you build, building lots of effigies may well earn you unwanted attention. If you're building a fortress, that point is moot, but if your survival strategy is to avoid notice, you might not want to build lots of them."
TheForest,3azhos,weliveinayellowsub,2,Wed Jun 24 20:52:26 2015 UTC,"Native effigies work as signposts for the natives.  This means you may want to destroy them.  Otherwise the native effigies built around your base will attract more natives that will build more effigies around your base, attracting even more natives, so on and so forth, leading to a vicious cycle."
TheForest,3azhos,NativeKiller,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, destroying the effigies the natives put up seems to be a good idea because they tend to show up more frequently if you leave them.

TheForest,3ap7ml,iswearatkids,3,Mon Jun 22 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"Your fort is on their nightly route. They investigate any disturbance such as forts, fires and survivor movement.  The more you attack them the more mutants they send.  You can't beat them that way.  Build a very small site up the hillside and watch them.  Wait for them to pass and then go get food, logs, etc. behind them before the come back.  I've had no use for effigies."

TheForest,3ap7ml,LazySnake,4,Mon Jun 22 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"According to my experience, effigies aren't very reliable in deterring native attacks, lit or not.   I just do without them at all and don't see much of a difference.  Also, it seems that the recent patches upped the frequency/intensity of native attacks.    Keep in mind that the natives come to investigate locations where large scale constructions are taking place.  The attacks will become much less frequent when your construction is finished, and some time passes. ;)"
TheForest,3ap7ml,NativeKiller,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"Note likely.  Octopus mutants and the other big mutant still show up at least once a day at my fort, even though I haven't built anything there in [game]days."

TheForest,3ap7ml,Hayras90,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"Oh and there are effigies all around my camp, do i have to keep them  lit for them to have any effect?"
TheForest,3ap7ml,GrandWalrus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:26:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need to have them lit for any effect. Bigger effigies burn longer and are better at repelling them. I have found that fire arrows (press L with arrow knocked) is the most effective way to clear mutants from the proximity. Oh, also try to set up camp far from the plane as they are attracted to the crash site."
TheForest,3ap7ml,bunnybearlover,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:56:52 2015 UTC,I've found effigies to just attract more. It even says on the wiki when they see effigies they will likely leave and bring back a bigger group.  I'm starting to think they are more for leaving around the map rather than at your camp.
TheForest,3ap7ml,slrrp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:14:45 2015 UTC,If their scouting parties continue to make it back to their villages they will send more and more guys to you. Eventually massive waves will come and if you fend them off + make a large effigy they will leave you alone for a while.
TheForest,3ap7ml,wearestevo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"You're building on the beach and they seem to really like patrolling the beach. I built the same place and what I did was went into the forest, built lots of log holders, and I just farm lumber. Then at night when you can see their flashlights/fires I just cart them back and build up. Also put in Hella traps. Noose and dead fall traps are the best imo. If you put explosive traps place them away from structures. I didn't and my walls keep blowing out when they trigger 😕  Pretty soon your base will be done and it will all be good!"
TheForest,3aoszc,Hayras90,8,Mon Jun 22 07:34:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, they have been added into the newly introduced parts of The Forest. ;)  You can enter them but they are unsuitable for being built into bases unlike the other Native Huts. (Sadface)"

TheForest,3aoszc,NativeKiller,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:56:51 2015 UTC,"I guess these new native constructions are most likely safe to reside in, but their design makes it hard to turn them into bases.  The usual Native Huts, on the other hand, make excellent makeshift bases. ;)"
TheForest,3aoszc,Kataphractoi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:30:43 2015 UTC,How so?  Drop a couple of standing fires on either side of the ramp and no native will ever get to you.

TheForest,3aoszc,NativeKiller,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, turning one into a base is possible, indeed.  But, IMO, the new Native Camp isn't as suitable for being made into a makeshift base as the usual Native Huts, so I didn't bother making bases out of them. :D  The new Native Camps are inconvenient to enter and entering it makes it nearly impossible to see anything that is happening outside.  I would rather just build Small Cabins instead of using the new Native Camp. :)"

TheForest,3aqb4k,Shappie,2,Tue Jun 23 20:39:09 2015 UTC,Haha for real.  I'm almost constantly attacked by the small and big natives.  I've had the spider-thing multiple times and the arm-beast-whatever a couple as well.  If corpses didn't despawn my base would be knee deep in natives.
TheForest,3aqb4k,CalicoLime,2,Wed Jun 24 12:35:53 2015 UTC,Same here! I built on a patrol path and I'm too stubborn to leave. I like my giant tree cliff and I will damn well defend it!
TheForest,3aqb4k,Shappie,2,Wed Jun 24 12:44:51 2015 UTC,My buddy and I just found out yesterday that the village we built next to also has a cave entrance.  So that might explain some of the folks we've been seeing.    It definitely makes it more interesting but can be a pain in the ass to rebuild the same wall a dozen times.
TheForest,3aqb4k,CalicoLime,2,Wed Jun 24 12:46:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. I've got all defensive so once I'm hunkered in they're not breaking anything down. Last night's game concluded with me standing on top of my walls throwing bombs down on the muties screaming ""GET AWAY FROM MY SHITTY WALL"""

I've seen tons of them spawn just to all land in the same location, sometimes I can kill two or three with one swing. Its not just stumps either, I've seen them flock to the rocks at the bottom of standing fires and a few other things. Just have to keep an eye out for them."
TheForest,3anzsl,FishyJoeJr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:40:25 2015 UTC,"Building a 'Stick Marker' often attracts large flocks of birds around it, serving as a makeshift feather farm.  Be careful though, you can't get rid of Stick Markers at the moment and they will leave HUD marks.    Other kinds of constructions may also attract flocks of birds towards them but I can't recall what they are at the moment. :D"

TheForest,3anzsl,ScrubPlays,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:59:10 2015 UTC,You can build the hunting shelter pretty much anywhere and birds will come land on it.  Just stand there in front of it waving as you swing away collecting unlimited amounts of feathers.

Grab a log or two then spam spacebar(jump) against your walls while crouching to access your base while carrying the logs.  Yes, this is the infamous crouch-jumping exploit but that's probably the best you can do at the moment. :)...    Just remembered this!  You can also build other lower platforms nearby your previous platform(s) to use as stepping stones to hop on while carrying the logs!

There are massive amounts at night and I can hardly leave my base at all during the day in single player. But in multiplayer they only really come at night. And the multiplayer game is a lot older than the single player one.

But to answer your question I've found that the Golden spot listed helps quite a bit but the best spot for me was in the metal shipping containers.
TheForest,3agcm6,Hinasan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:18:55 2015 UTC,The metal shipping containers might actually be a better spot for you if you have trouble fighting back the hordes of natives that get in your way. :D
TheForest,3agcm6,NativeKiller,2,Sat Jun 20 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"I built on the plane, one side of base no walls needed, plane tail acts as sniper tower, I got lucky, my plane crashed next to a campsite with lots of suitcases, and is right by the beach , cloth snacks moltovs, everything respawns daily, only downside is no lizzards"
TheForest,3agcm6,hiketofreedom,2,Sat Jun 20 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"I have a spot I love building at cause it has pretty much everything needed for a self sustained base. I made a few videos of it and where it is located. If you head just a little south of the shipping crates (which are at the northern most point on the original island) you will find Goose Lake. My ""go to"" build location is slightly south west of the lake.  https://youtu.be/Os6XmqCRLS0 This video shows where I will be setting up a new base there.  https://youtu.be/AuMP-n6AmN8 This one is from a few patches ago but its the first base I built there and should demonstrate why this spot is ideal."

The one that says ""Cliff-side base (~25 in-game days of work, only one cannibal encounter)""  My friend and I made a base there and god DAMN it is amazing. I'll post pics next time we play (he's host)  We had to fight a bit until we got our first wall up, but it was a cakewalk after that. We now have a walled in compact base at the bottom of the cliff, with stairs leading to a city up top.  This area has lizards, trees aplenty, and respawning effigies that you can break down for skulls, sticks, and rocks. All within your base if you make the walls big enough. The skulls are amazing for lighting the inside of your base without using fires that can damage you (skull lamps).  On another note, I need more people to play with. I'm hosting a map that has a giant walled base in a new area I'm trying out."
TheForest,3agcm6,tha_dood,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"I build next to the rowboat about halfway between the anchor and the shipping containers, next to some luggage. It's a good spot for resources (rope/bottles/flares/sodas etc.) And there's a small field filled with sticks and rocks, not to mention trees not too far off. I'm building a mega base (high foundation, stairs leading up, furniture and a log cabin inside etc.) And it's on the water. Issue is there's a TON OF cannibal traffic. I have countless traps and about 24 effigies. I'm only on day 9...  Still my plane crashed right next to this on the hillside, and next to that is the film campsite, so unlimited resources and a lot of cannibals."
TheForest,3agcm6,wearestevo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"My base is at the very north of the map on the mountain right by the wall.

What I mean is that, wearing the deer skin   DOESN'T SEEM TO REMOVE THE ANNOYING LEAVES FROM THE STEALTH ARMOR AT ALL!  ...Hope this is happening to just me, not to any others."
TheForest,3acw8c,NativeKiller,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:00:57 2015 UTC,"Hm, the left hand never bothered me, especially since the right side counts when you aim with the bow, but for me both hands are usually ""cleared"" with this method. One time I had the same problem as you (I guess) but loading from the main menu fixed that. Alpha issues, early access yada yada.  Also, as i just found out: You can equip/wear multiple deer skins! The following ones are shown on your legs, body and the left hand too :) No idea if they have any effect on stealth though.  I hope in future patches they will add an effect to the skins like keeping you warm/ dry for longer, so far it doesn't seem to make a difference."

Why can't I pick up a turtle shell? Someone said it's behind the backpack sort of hidden in the inventory, but I have a rebreather back there. I see no shell and they just drop when I pick them up.  Aside from that, my buddy and I have a sweet base going on that I'm rather proud of. Haven't dealt with any of the... bigger guys yet... we climbed down into a cave and it was dark as shit, used our lighters until we saw it waiting near the bottom of the rope. NOPE, we both fucking climbed for our lives."

TheForest,3a3t7q,officers3xy,4,Wed Jun 17 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"I think I discovered a small issue with turtle shells. When I killed my first turtle, it gave me the shell and some generic meat. But once I had a shell in my inventory, I tried to kill more turtles for food. When they died and I tried to loot them, it first tries to pick up the shell. It throws it back down because I already have one. After that, there is no meat left behind.    I found a workaround to this problem. Before hunting a turtle for meat, first get rid of any existing shell in your inventory by building a water collector and placing the shell in it. Turtles will now properly drop shells and meat. You have to do this each time you get a new shell. Have your inventory clear of sticks by placing them in a stick collector so you don't waste any. Press C to delete the partially constructed water collectors if you don't want tons built.    P.S. Thanks /u/NativeKiller for your guide! I just started playing the game a few days ago, and it helped me a lot."
TheForest,3a4baj,Old_Crow89,7,Wed Jun 17 03:06:07 2015 UTC,Using tree saps to attach teeth/booze to melee weapons will increase attack damage.  Attaching feathers will reduce stamina usage and increase attack speed.

TheForest,3a4baj,tha_dood,2,Wed Jun 17 07:12:58 2015 UTC,"Depends...  If you are any good with archery and have enough supplies for fire arrows, melee combat is quite meaningless.  However, the skull club does have a VERY HIGH damage rating... for a melee weapon that is, while fire weapons are pretty much ranged one hit kill attacks.  Be careful if you are going to use the skull club though, it swings very slowly and eats up a lot of stamina per swing."

TheForest,3a4baj,Sticky32,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:20:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say the modern axe is the best for logging because it is the only one that uses less stamina to use and actually doesn't drain your stamina unlike all the others(I believe, haven't tested it in a few patches so things could have changed.) Also I think they still all take the same amount of hits to actually chop down a tree, but I think that is supposed to change, which would make sense all the others have way more mass behind them and longer handles, therefore requiring less hits to cut down a tree than the plane axe (at least in real-world physics.)"
TheForest,3a4baj,Sticky32,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"JFYI, the modern axe now only takes 9 strikes to chop a tree down. ;)"

TheForest,3a3bx9,bunnybearlover,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:57:39 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're the client and not the host of the original game you're trying to load. Only the host can save that game. When the client saves it only saves your inventory on that game.   When you try and go back in it will just be your own co-op game. In order to get back in the original that same person has to host again.   I hope that makes sense..

I just know you just have to use your own or it bugs out the other sled.   Most dev teams have separate people working on bugs and content. When people are in school for it there's usually a focus on certain things.   People will complain either way though. I'm not being mean when I say that.

Bugs are not the main priority right now, and the fact that we get any bug patches at all is amazing.  You are playing an EARLY ACCESS game, not just that, but one that is in ALPHA. Not even beta.   If the devs stopped to fix every single little bug before adding new features, development would slow to a crawl, and I guarantee you that you don't want that.

I came here for input from the devs If they see these boards . No you are completely wrong from a development point of view , being an indie my self i can say with 100% faith their practices are wrong . It takes a longer while to keep adding incomplete things to a game then to fix and then move forward . There isnt much to further the scope of the forest unless some ""GAME BREAKING"" things are fixed first in a patch focused on just that . This game has been on year access for over a year now on something , thats allot of time , they have the financial backing and there is no excuse what so ever now"

TheForest,39xz65,Kativera,5,Mon Jun 15 19:10:35 2015 UTC,"I think we see this posted once a week. Personally I'm OK with reducing the effectiveness of fire (especially the one-touch-and-dead fire arrow that you just run around poking enemies with), but not until the rest of the weapons are properly balanced.  It takes, what, 8 chops? to kill a normal mutant with an axe. That makes no sense. If I whack anyone 8 times with an axe, they'll have been dead at least 6 hits ago.   It takes two hits to chop off a corpse's arm, but 8 hits just to turn someone into a corpse. Ridiculous. The current OP fire situation makes the game survivable until the axes start acting like axes and not sticks."
TheForest,39xz65,Eslader,2,Mon Jun 15 19:16:14 2015 UTC,"In the beginning I agree the fire is too much. The problem is after awhile when you have constant creatures outside your base at once. They hate me. I can't even go out during the day right now on single player(seems to be less on co-op).  Sometimes at night there's two distorted ones trying to break down my walls while there's 6 other enemies hovering. The big distorted ones don't die for me with one or two molotovs without axing them a bit.  Sometimes it's the only way to kill the others before going out there to get the big ones with my stupid axe.   If there was still only maybe 10 for the whole night it wouldn't be too bad. But, at least in my game, I eventually run out of the molotovs anyway."

You can just stand by it and whack 'em while they stand there. Make sure you're on the beach though. No beach = no seagulls."
TheForest,39xz65,Fruit_Salad_,2,Mon Jun 15 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"I like to set up a stick marker to attract birds anywheres. The more open the area the more likely birds will land there instead of other places. Best spot I've found is up the mountain as far as you can go. Birds will just keep coming to the base of it and the top one after another, this is a flawless way to farm feathers, the mutants usually cant reach you that high either."

TheForest,39xz65,grottohopper,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:10:04 2015 UTC,Disagree completely. Molotovs should stay where they are if you insist there is an issue they should lower the amount of booze that spawns. Why would you suggest making the game less realistic? There is nothing more tedious than just lowering an enemies health. Far better to have to use strategy to over come them. There is more skill in throwing a molotov than swinging an axe so no idea why it bothers you.... I get its your opinion but i sure hope devs dont listen. What should happen is normal arrows get a buff because atm they are completely useleas (fire arrows dont currently work for me either).

TheForest,39sy2u,Fixhotep,5,Sun Jun 14 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer is a bit buggy; I believe it was not intended at first, and added later.  Clients and hosts do not have the same experience, such as one being able to see sharks and boars but the other can not.  Item sharing does not work.  Save games are confusing and buggy.  Ive been holding off on playing the game until multiplayer is fixed up a bit."
TheForest,39sy2u,decaxon,3,Sun Jun 14 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, main menu shows a count down until the next patch Co-op, really depends who you play with. Glitchy at points but not game breaking, stuff like clients can't see certain objects that the host can. Traps are fun, not too effective as they will only kill one cannibal if they walk into it. I use happy birthday traps as doors sometimes since they don't hurt the player but do hurt the cannibals. Fire. Setting a cannibal on fire will definitely kill it once it is on fire. A molotov thrown right can take out a whole patrol, arrows can be lit and you can just run up to them with a lit arrow and it will set them on fire although this is a pretty cheesy tactic. Sometimes they may just walk into fires too. Weapons can also be upgraded; tree sap and cannibal teeth will make a weapon stronger, feathers and tree sap make it swing faster (Ah video game logic) and cloth can be added to a weapon to make it temporarily flamable."

TheForest,39sy2u,bunnybearlover,2,Sun Jun 14 18:44:18 2015 UTC,"I play with my boyfriend and we enjoy it. It's fun building and exploring together.   You just have to eat to replenish energy, or build a bench. Set up a camp during the day. With two people it goes much faster. At first we usually build a fence with steps leading in and out to hide at night while we work on the rest. We usually build our first camp around the opening of the plane. The stuff in there resets so it helps when you start. Inside your fence, set up a fire, a bench and something to save. The first days there aren't too many cannibals, so it's easier. I wasn't too great at hunting food in the beginning so we set up a drying rack and cut up cannibals we found laying around. The food lasts awhile so you don't have to worry about cooking.    You'll eventually find stuff to keep you busy in your base at night if you don't like to explore then."
TheForest,39sy2u,KungFuHamster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:39:10 2015 UTC,When you build a shelter there is a prompt to press c to save or z to sleep. If there are too many cannibals near by you won't be able to sleep. Usually when this happens I take a stroll the beach for a bit and they disperse. I would start by building a temporary shelter and some standing fires near some suitcases on the beach. Then you have the minimum necessary to sleep and find soda and snacks to keep your energy up until you get something better going.

TheForest,39kmzq,Hamilton5M,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:54:29 2015 UTC,Cannibals/mutants are also attracted to fire. Having a lot of bonfires and whatnot will attract them. I've found that building a cabin up high and then using a rope to get to it usually makes it quite safe for the night. You can also put a fire pit in the cabin to stay warm. Cabins can be connected via tree bridges to other platforms/treehouses to keep you safe and above ground

If one runs away, it alerts its camp to your location, and eventually the number that know about you rises. A lot. That is the true secret to avoiding them, otherwise there is really no ""safe"" place because all they need to do is know about you and begin to hate you. It works the same way for the things in the caves, too. And they really hate you."

TheForest,39ftc6,quimby491,4,Thu Jun 11 12:58:00 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but the lack of a quick selection bar might be intended. It keeps you on your toes at all times, and stops you from running around the forest holding a berry pouch. Having to switch back to your axe from your inventory might mean death, as such, it makes players run around with their axe, then stop and pick the berries and then equip their axe again before continuing."
TheForest,39ftc6,terrordrone_nl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"Lack of quick selection bar is just one of my problems.

TheForest,39ftc6,dahni194,3,Thu Jun 11 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with terrordrone_nl in that the lack of a hot bar may be intended but I think a quick select between two equipable items should be implemented. Here's my reasoning...   I like to believe (although I'm sure its debatable) that I'm a full grown adult with a functional, developed brain with the ability to prioritize based off current necessity and situation. When I go hiking, running or whatever type of outdoor training I don't need my keys or cell phone handy so they get stored in my pack but I may need a quick snack, water or hunting knife so those are all accessible in various pouches along the side of my pack. I thing the addition of a box or spot in our inventory to designate two quick select items that would alternate when ""Q"" is pressed would represent that ability to plan for your current activity.   Lets say your intending to pick those berries cause blue paint makes your axe look dope. You could prioritize in your quick select slots the modern axe and the berry pouch. If you ran into trouble you would still have to open your inventory to equip the heal or equip the bow. Maybe you could even place meds in the quick select area but it only counts as 1 application of the medication so you couldn't just spam heal."

TheForest,3980zm,decaxon,12,Tue Jun 9 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"I often wonder what the cannibal's perspective/story would be.  Just strolling through the forest with my lunch buddies doing a bit of hunting and exploring when all of a sudden this creepy fucker with an axe flashes past and Harry is dead! Next thing I know George has an arrow sticking out of his chest and he's on fucking fire! I run over to beat out the flames and see that maniac now coming for me! Then he stops. Picks up a mushroom off the ground and eats it! I just stand there staring in shock while George is on the ground spitting out teeth and dying. Then this weirdo wanders a little way off and spreads out a blanket on the ground and lightning quick, obsessively spreads out all these items he had in his backpack. He spends several minutes moving items around and mashing them together to no obvious result. Eventually he wraps his axe in a rag and out of nowhere a bell or something chimes! He seems satisfied. Then he places a stick in the middle of the blanket and drops 5 feathers on top of it. The bell chimes and just as lightning fast he has packed up the items and is pointing a bow and arrow at me. He stares at me as he lights the end of it. Fuck that, I'm not going out like George all screaming and writhing. This guy is a freaking nightmare! Why is this maniac so interested in mutilating dead trees into these weird box shapes? What did the trees do? What did George do? I'm going to run back to Auntie and tell her what happened. Maybe she's got come clue what to do with this homicidal maniac that's cutting down the entire forest."
TheForest,3980zm,BrissyAussie,6,Wed Jun 10 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting perspective. :D  I have a similar opinion;  You are not stuck with the natives, it is THEM who are stuck with YOU!"

TheForest,3980zm,BrissyAussie,2,Wed Jun 10 04:57:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, that sounds like you've really gone native there. If you look at their camps, it seems that they do a very similar thing."
TheForest,3980zm,NativeKiller,3,Wed Jun 10 09:28:45 2015 UTC,"That's where I got the inspiration for the cutting table and throwing the corpses on the bonfire.

I create them more to put in my two cents and maybe start constructive discussions about the game. They seem to get generally positive feedback but if posting here is an issue let me know and I'll stop posting them to this reddit.

TheForest,39afdg,decaxon,4,Wed Jun 10 12:24:07 2015 UTC,Top all time post on this sub is about people disliking lets plays and youtube commentaries and the general consensus is that most people will just downvote and move on which sucks because some good content usually gets skimmed over. I used to be an LPer and what I used to do was post some content like an imgur album and in one of the image descriptions posted a link to the video that the album was from which most people were ok with because its making content for the sub without the shameless self promotion. I was going to make a video of touring my base with some commentary and post an album of screenshots linking to the full video but I think I've posted enough here for a while
TheForest,39afdg,decaxon,2,Wed Jun 10 13:57:23 2015 UTC,"That's a cool idea, posting an album and including a link to a video.

I mean he technically did fall out of the sky.  One thing I've realized throughout my short time playing the game is that the cannibals more or less respect nature to a ludicrous degree. Often they are seen worshiping the sun, the plants, or the water; while its never specified my best guess is that (and I know this sounds stupid) they eat each other in order to not interfere with nature (AKA: Hunting animals, taking too much from the forest, etc..) unless they need the bare necessities (shelter, food, and water).  Which most likely explains why the cannibals start snooping around the more you take down trees, killing animals, and basically ruining an ecosystem that they've preserved (all the while quarreling amongst each other.).  I mean I would be pissed too if some asshole dropped out of the sky, started destroying all my trees, killing harmless deer and rabbits, and killing what could be my family/next meal (talking about the cannibals).  Or....  I could be looking too deep during my time waiting for daylight; because they won't let me sleep for long, because I am a literal demon to them come Day 4.  Either way, I'd rather have very vague/obscure hints as to what they are or their culture; because their actions are what make them so scary. If you're quiet you can still see that they are human, but their cannibalistic/animalistic nature is what makes them the most unnerving humans/creatures/beasts/??? I've ever faced in a game."
TheForest,398fye,Aj_The_Wanderer,3,Wed Jun 10 04:37:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they might not even try nor need to brainwash Tommy.  If they worship him as their Messiah, he might just naturally start to like them.  ...Like them so much that he might actually rather stay with them than you. (Sadface)"

As it stands now, they drag you through the forest and you wake up in a cave.. with no immediate danger, and just walk away. You say they worship nature.. yet they collect flashlights and things from the plane crash and decorate themselves with them. They are extremely vague creatures. They are violent and skiddish and savage. If anything they worship death."

TheForest,398fye,NativeKiller,5,Wed Jun 10 06:40:06 2015 UTC,"The OP'S writing may not be world class indeed, but there is one thing to consider.  The first native that you encounter in the game, the one you see in the post-plane crash cutscene, gently takes your son in its arms and just leaves you behind.  Yes, it might be just taking your son for an easy meal, but seeing that gave me the idea that it might have 'other reasons' for taking your son.  I agree on your argument that the behavior of the natives in the OP's post seems quite off, and that it would ruin immersion, though.  Furthermore, encountering my son so often would make the game very anti-horror for me.  IMO, if you get to witness your son brainwashed, it should probably happen only once such as in the very end of the game."
TheForest,398fye,NativeKiller,3,Wed Jun 10 04:23:52 2015 UTC,"When I thought of this idea, I honestly didn't even care about the kid. I should have titled my post, ""Where the cannibals take you.""

Two: Allowing us to take as many of one item as we wish. For example, the weight restriction keeps us balanced in what we choose to take on long voyages (into the caves for example) but say if we're constructing standing fires around our camp, we can carry limitless amounts of rocks/sticks (up until we're encumbered) rather than being limited to ten sticks and five rocks at a time."

TheForest,38vii9,frumpycat123,2,Mon Jun 8 00:29:31 2015 UTC,No. It's not. You're using a technical term wrong. Single player can't lag.
TheForest,38vii9,Keksus_,2,Mon Jun 8 01:16:14 2015 UTC,Guess he has frame issues. :D
TheForest,38vii9,NativeKiller,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. And i would be so happy if people would stop using ""lag"" wrong. When it comes to video games lag is defined as a high ping or in terms of something like input lag. But not framerate issues. These things are so extremely different."
TheForest,38vii9,Keksus_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:22:47 2015 UTC,"Frame rate lowering has the effect of input lag though. Response time for a game running at 60fps is faster than one running at 30fps. Thus, it is correct to call the effect of low framerate 'lag'."
TheForest,38vii9,LittleBigPerson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:48:19 2015 UTC,No... no it doesn't. you can have input lag with 60fps and have perfect response with 15. Also he definitely wasn't talking about input lag.
TheForest,38vii9,Keksus_,0,Wed Jun 10 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it does. When you move the mouse, sure the PC recognises the input, but the physical effect of you moving the mouse, as in the camera turning, is delayed as you have to wait longer for the next frame to SEE it happening. The input lag isn't exactly input lag but it has the same effect."
TheForest,38vii9,LittleBigPerson,-1,Wed Jun 10 06:20:37 2015 UTC,Well then i do have frame rate issues then and I'm in Australia so i might also have lag.
TheForest,38vii9,frumpycat123,2,Mon Jun 8 02:33:59 2015 UTC,I feel like I could take on 20+ normal mutants at once if they had really smooth combat mechanics. I end up getting counter hit twice when one is staggering backwards. I've fought 8 and won pretty easily.

TheForest,38vii9,NickyNice,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:58:43 2015 UTC,I think they should give you a couple of days where it's just scouting parties. It will build suspense :D
TheForest,38vii9,LittleBigPerson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:42:54 2015 UTC,I thought people were only complaining about the first days right after v.18. They already fixed that in v.18b. That was an insane amount.  It's good now.   Now after being alive for awhile it is getting a little annoying how hard it is to build.  There are multiple packs and plenty of those grey mutant things destroying my base even during the day. :(
TheForest,38yleq,Shindi,2,Sun Jun 7 23:08:57 2015 UTC,I'm not very tech-savvy but it could possibly a problem with  Driver optimization or the Internet settings.    Hope another tech-savvy redditor gives you a satisfying answer soon. :D
TheForest,38yleq,NativeKiller,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:13:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment though! :)  I'm not tech savvy enough to know much about why the internet settings would cause a problem. I did move my DNS to the public google ones though a couple weeks ago, but this lag was present before that.  As for drivers, I don't know either, I'm up to date on my drivers according to nvidia."
TheForest,38yleq,NativeKiller,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:00:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe since the game is an indie game that is still in alpha, drivers are to be optimized yet. :D"

TheForest,38qfqi,NativeKiller,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:11:43 2015 UTC,Yup. I conducted some experiments yesterday. It takes 4 fire arrows to kill one. It almost immediately dies after being hit by the fourth arrow. This is true for both legsy and armsy. Of course you have to wait each time for the fire to extinguish before shooting the next arrow.

TheForest,38qhmn,Piemasterjelly,3,Fri Jun 5 23:38:25 2015 UTC,The devs suggest you start a new game because with the new update (mainly the destructible structures) it may cause bugs. I highly suggest you start a new save file to get everything working properly.
TheForest,38qhmn,NickyNice,0,Sat Jun 6 02:17:07 2015 UTC,How do I save the old file in case the new one doesn't work?
TheForest,38qhmn,dahni94,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"If you want to save the old file I would make a backup of your forest game folder. Steams default installation folder would be C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common  Make a new folder on desktop or wherever you want and copy your ""The Forest"" folder in there. Then if you want to go back to the old file just copy the files out of your newly created backup folder and paste it into the directory above.  But I'm sorry if I wasn't clear in my first post I meant that it may cause bugs if you DON'T start a new save (not that the update itself was bugged) So updating will only cause issues if you are using an old file. But now you know how to make backups :)"

As I was chopping body 1, 2 more attacked. As I finished body 1 chopping I got attacked by 3 more. Chopping up body 2 was uneventful, Placed large effigy blueprint, turned to be attacked a single mud chick, while fighting her a white male attacked. Right after kill those two I got halfway through body number 3 and saw a group of three charging my way. 13 cannibals in 5-7 minutes doesn't seem reasonable to me. Especially since I was only in game like 20 minutes when the attacks started. Didn't even have my first real hut up to save the game.

I'd check your buddies graphics chip because 20fps sounds like he's either running one of the older versions of The Forest (Not likely, obv) or he has a very weak one if a 9800GTX+ can handle it on ~medium and at least stay above 30."

I was sort of let down the first time I used one and then had to low crawl through it to get it to work and that's when it didn't just lock in place. I have a feeling doors are gonna be much more important to defensive base building due to the destructibility of our bases. We may have to implement multi-walled layers of defense and working doors will so come in handy.

TheForest,38nmzi,DrNitr0s,3,Fri Jun 5 11:30:57 2015 UTC,"I have some footage from last night of how it works. This is a spider woman smashing our door down and jumping on my head: http://www.twitch.tv/esolu204/v/5906607  Here is from two nights ago when just one of the taller cave mutants made our house implode: http://www.twitch.tv/esolu204/v/5831639  Pro-tip #1: They cannot break down defensive walls. But they can break down any wall that stacks logs horizontally. That means windows, doors, and experimental walls.  Pro-tip #2: They will also always take out your defensive spikes. Thus, traps are the best way to ""patch up"" the weak parts of your wall that they tend to clip through or simply walk over because it's slanted too much.  Other than that, this update really shines and people are missing out. Multiplayer especially. Get some friends and dig right in!   I've been streaming it every night for three days, and I'm addicted. We want to go caving but it's taken us this long fighting, dieing, respawing, fighting them off, and making our camp.  It feels like caving is really the endgame, but we're on day 25 in-game and the aggression of the mutants is insane. We've basically come down to having no doors, just defensive walls, and even then they just jump over. Like fucking run and jump over!  Get your friends, dig in and good luck. I assure you it will be fun!"
TheForest,38nmzi,dzmowatt,2,Sun Jun 7 11:31:29 2015 UTC,"For this patch we’ve focused on our new building destruction system. It’s now possible to destroy buildings you’ve made, either with hand weapons or explosives. Enemies can now also try and bring structures down, so its more important than ever to lay out traps and defenses to stop them getting in.  Previously built structures won’t be destroyed correctly so we recommend starting a new save game for this patch. Experimental walls have also changed and loading a saved game with these built may cause additional issues.  As further balance may be needed, we’ve also added a cheat mode that will make structures indestructible – type ‘ironforest’ in title scene to enable this cheat mode.   From 'survivetheforest.com"

Perhaps later in the development we'll get different tribes of mutants fighting eachother, or working together. A dynamic system would be the most amazing for this. I'm just imagining how the player invades a camp during the night when most mutants are out hunting, he kills a few mutants and then drags a mutant corpse from another tribe into the village, causing a war between the 2 tribes."

I know after reading some of the former updates, cannibals have been re-balanced a few times before so I'm going to guess it's the latter.

Where as now you could be chopping a tree and then turn around and there just a mutant creepily staring at you or about to charge lol. Keeps me on my toes"
TheForest,38mewu,arifex,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:10:55 2015 UTC,"I used to use the bow frequently, too but I don't know since when - the grass of the stealth armor robs me of sight, now I just spam molotovs.  I'd like to use the stealth armor but I also like to shoot arrows... :( I guess it's already addressed ad the devs"

It's hard to see a fish with all those refractions at the water surface. So I was staring at the water below me when suddenly amidst the day a crazy, screaming cannibal woman  attack jumped me and hit me on the back. Almost got an heart attack."

First night I was mauled by a pack of about 9-12 normal cannibals and the following day was chased down by a pack of darker skinned cannibals. The only thing I had made throughout that entire first day was a simple camp fire to ward off the cold."

TheForest,38h3a6,Havocb,3,Thu Jun 4 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"WTF?  I logged in to my beautiful fort near the anchor beach.  Lots of damage to it; wall missing or leaning, new branch growth covered and filled my tree house; my food supply and medicine supply destroyed.  I have (had) another little fort/home on the beach just N along the Dead Shark Beach, with a very, very steep path down from the ridge where mutants are not supposed to go.  I went down there and went into my cabin on the beach.  Before I could think I was surrounded by 8-10 screaming mutants.  All around the cabin and in knee deep ocean water in the front.  I threw a bomb out each window, followed by a Mollie at one I could see, then went out the door with my flare gun going.  Killed 3 more around the cabin and another 2 at the base of the steep!!! path up to the ridge above the beach.    Rather than go up the path I went along a walk I made along the beach, which led around to Dead Shark Beach.  I was thumped in the head, and survived only because I started with full lizard armor and the cargo axe fully charged.  It was some kind of multi-legged or octopuss-e thing that had come down the rock cliff!  I backed into the ocean and it came after me and I hit it with a Mollie I still had in my hand!  I looked towards Dead Shark Beach and saw a lot of activity (8 or so more!).    So I climbed the path anyway, and just barely got to the summit when another octopuss-e attacked.  I blocked with my axe and ran towards the Anchor Beach.  About halfway there I grabbed another Mollie and sidestepped and hit the Octo with it.  At least 4 more mutants were coming so I pulled out a bomb and pitched it just in front of me and turned and sprinted N along the beach.    I have/had! a great home in one of the cargo bins up the beach and ran to it; but it was destroyed by rocks and sand.  I had a hunting shelter on top of the hill just up the beach where the 2 lookout towers are.  I went up there for a bite to eat and a little rest and to calm down and stop trembling(in real time!  lol!)  3 more Mutants, one a female met me there.  I pitched a Mollie at them, got 2, and killed the third with my axe.  I saw more coming and ran on N to the little island where I have a little cabin.  It's still surrounded by water.  but a patrol of 4 Mutants was along the beach; so I crouched and got out my last bomb.  I got 3 with it and the 4th just stood there so I used the axe.  I swam to the island and could rest and eat and think and sleep.  The next day I went to check my camp at Geese Lake and was attacked again by Octo and 4 Mutants as I approached.  I ran up towards the airplane site; stopping once to kill the Mutant leader with a flame arrow.  At the plane I went through and picked up the same goodies there the first time.  I jumped out the front and was attacked by about 4 Mutants.   I had made more Mollies while on the plane so I threw Mollies and ran down the hill, NE and got back to my Island site.    That's where my Avatar is waiting while I compose this and decide whether or not I'll open the game again tonight!  I was in-game abut 30 minutes total and killed more Mutants than I've killed during the past 4-5 weeks; plus those Octopuss-es!  WTF?  I like to create forts, and explore and enjoy the scenery and the activity of hunting and fishing and climbing trees.  Maybe this is really a Horrorific Survival Game!"

TheForest,38gxg4,NativeKiller,6,Thu Jun 4 03:23:59 2015 UTC,Previously built structures won't be destroyed correctly so we recommend starting a new save game for this patch. Experimental walls have also changed and loading a saved game with these built may cause additional issues.

Then again, I would not be pleased if the devs pulled the ""it was an illusion all along!"" Card on us.  I personally think Bermuda Triangle and stuff.

There are multiple cave entrances blocked by large rocks. All but one, which is larger than the others. Human remains and other unidentifiable dead beings litter the ground. There are a few babies feeding off the fresher corpses. The light from the flare causes something out of site to let out this creepy groan. Suddenly all goes  dark and you're taking damage; falling down the hole watching the world outside the hole move further away.  Damn, I 'm looking forward to this update :)"

The Forest is good enough."
TheForest,388val,Eslader,3,Wed Jun 3 13:42:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree. The sting is a crutch. As soon as I hear it I run so I know the cannibals are behind me and it makes it easier to find and kill them. This will up the scare level, which is great. But it will also get me killed more. ;)"

TheForest,388val,MisterBreeze,6,Tue Jun 2 21:56:21 2015 UTC,Honestly The Forest has so far been one of the best early access games I've ever participated in. The devs know what they're doing and we're seeing a pretty solid game beginning to take shape. I'm incredibly excited for each and everyone of these updates and I can't say the same for other games.  Good work guys and gals. I'm amazed we're only at 0.18. Can't wait to see what's coming.

TheForest,388val,NativeKiller,5,Wed Jun 3 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course!  ...As long as you shoot unsuspecting enemies with fire arrows.  To be serious, a bow does not belong in the 'axe/rock/stick type weapon' category, nor is it a melee weapon, so...  No, the bow cannot be used for stealth kills, at least not in the same way as those other weapons. :D"

TheForest,388val,Captain_Flaps_Jack,2,Wed Jun 3 09:34:38 2015 UTC,I think the biggest thing is the focus on immersion (music/sound) and gameplay systems that a lot of people have been requesting.  Building destruction is huge and it came along with a repair mechanic too!  My favourite part is that experimental buildings can now be used in multiplayer.  Keep up the awesome work!
TheForest,388val,SurvivalistGaming,4,Tue Jun 2 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"Still no shrooms, curses!   Oh well, sounds like a really solid update, lots of new and tweaked stuff. Good job devs!"
TheForest,388val,Captain_Flaps_Jack,2,Tue Jun 2 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"We wanted to have certain mushrooms in the game affect the player, but it seemed like it would be annoying for players that didn't know or want to eat them. Perhaps later in the future though!"
TheForest,388val,NativeKiller,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"No worries. I wrote a big ole' bit on the wiki's suggestion page about mushrooms regarding the place holders for the psychedelic psilocybin Liberty Cap and the muscimole deliriant Amanita muscaria that both exist in game but don't yet serve a function. Regardless, having the placeholders there is implication that something will probably eventually happen with them once we're able to gather/dry mushrooms. It'll be difficult knowing how to best implement it into the game, as it can serve a function beyond simply artistic immersion!   I can see new players to the game being completely disoriented if they think they're getting a cheap meal out of mushrooms and then end up seeing the world breath and shudder around them after eating Amanita's. What a nightmare that would be.   I did always love UnReal Worlds use of mushrooms though. A wide variety of safe, poisonous and irritable mushrooms exist to gather, with even a hallucinogenic one just for added flavor. Although a rouge like, the game is still a mess of fun, and the biodiversity in the game is right up this games alley. The more plants to identify, the better!"
TheForest,388val,TheFresherPrince,3,Tue Jun 2 19:13:36 2015 UTC,One very important question.  Are the save files going to be reset?

TheForest,388val,TheFresherPrince,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:37:38 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem like they're revealing anything about the sinkholes (unless they're entrances to new caves) which is too bad. Amazing update though.  I hope that some giant tentacles will come out and attack you (kind of like the HiveMind from Dead Space) and you can cut them off and such. The door would take you down to the head/main part of the beast so you could finish it off.   I'm still glad they removed the music sting when noticed by cannibals. Amazing work, devs!"
TheForest,388val,BOS13,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:21:05 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really fit the theme of the game to me...  But with climbing now added, we should be able to climb down that hole soon!"
TheForest,388val,autowikibot,3,Wed Jun 3 14:18:39 2015 UTC,"Meh, was just a random idea that popped into my head. I was thinking that the hole looked like some strange abomination would slither it's way out.  I'm glad they added all the control with the climbing axe. I wonder if they'll make the holes steeper and deeper and maybe we can parachute into them. Parachutes would be nice for when mountains come out as well... Not something you'd really expect to find just lying around in the wilderness, but I feel like it would be a nice addition... Especially with all the touch-ups they've been doing to fall damage lately."
TheForest,38az5c,NativeKiller,6,Wed Jun 3 01:14:12 2015 UTC,"Finding a good corner or cliff is going to be important now. That way you don't have to worry about the mutants breaking your walls down from all directions. You would also need less traps. Has to be done right though, I have had some of em scale down a cliff into my base before!"
TheForest,38az5c,Tfish,2,Wed Jun 3 04:57:39 2015 UTC,"I think one of my creepiest play throughs happened at the base of a cliff. I didn't see a single native for days. Sometimes they'd wake me up at night, but I never actually saw any near my base.   Then one day I went up on the top of the cliff my camp was at the base of, and there must have been 15-20 effigies hanging right over my base.  Freaky to think how often they were barely a few yards away watching me."

It's kind of silly right now how easy it is to kill cannibals with your infinite supply of anti-cannibal incendiary missiles.  Also, about the deadly cannibal bacteria idea...I like the idea of having toxic arrows that can turn cannibals against each other, but why add cannibal teeth? Wouldn't the cannibals already be immune whatever germs existed in their mouths?  PS: LOVE the Shark Tooth arrow idea. An option like that would make The Forest one of the first games with a realistic arrow damage mechanic."

Starting games over to get them won't really work. You generally start during the day and they're less active and rarely in their camps at that time.   I like the progression.

TheForest,36txoz,Piemasterjelly,9,Fri May 22 02:26:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think new items are the priority with The Forest. I'd like to see the map changed, if it was procedurally generated that would add infinite replayability. When I first started playing, the thing that really drew me in was the atmosphere and the genuine state of terror the cannibals instilled, but once you start to learn where they all live, what the map looks like, and how to manipulate the AI things start to get a little bland. This is the point where people start to focus on construction and the game devolves into 'gather 100000 logs', and this is why people are keen to focus on items.  This is exactly where DayZ went wrong, they added tiny little features, items and mechanics but ultimately the foundations of the game were the problem. The game needs to continuously surprise the player, new monsters, new areas, new creatures, etc. Items are superfluous at the moment, the game is in an early state where the foundations need to be set."
TheForest,36txoz,mcbrosephine,3,Fri May 22 03:52:32 2015 UTC,"The salt pan is a nice idea. Maybe it could transition into an alternate method of long-term storage like salt-barrel storage. Build the barrel out of, say, 2 logs and 2 rope, fill with thre lots of salt, and pack with maybe 5 generic meats.  This would ideally have an effect on the thirst meter of course, if you chose to eat the salted meat. This would provide a cool choice where you could find yourself low on water/soda, and so choose to go hunt for fresh meat rather than eat the salted meat."
TheForest,36txoz,Kyoketsu_Shoge,2,Fri May 22 03:23:25 2015 UTC,THIS seems to be a great idea :D
TheForest,36txoz,NativeKiller,1 point,Fri May 22 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"More Ideas that I thought of while building  Increase the capacity of the log holder it currently holds the same amount as the log sled but is less mobile and costs more  Make the Rebreather remove the underwater overlay you cannot see anything at the moment  Baths- For if you are away from a water source but are covered in blood  Specific types of damage-You cant just heal fall damage by eating Aloe+Marigold. Maybe a more hardcore type of game. Cut wounds would require cloth to heal as a bandage, Aloe for Burns, Splints (Cloth+Stick) for fall damage and maybe blunt damage  Bird Cages-Source of feathers  Birds are actually food  Tortoise/Turtles drop Generic Meat  Crock pot/Soap Pot from Turtle Shells- Put in water + Meat and you get 3 meals out of one lizard/fish/rabbit/generic meat. Also maybe a small bit of healing  Compass-Just for help with Navigation  Map-Not one you can bring up by pressing the M Key im thinking either a blank piece of paper and a pencil you can use or a hand drawn map that automatically fills in as the player maps the coast and finds landmarks.  Noise Traps- For a more hardcore mode where the piano sounds are off made from String+Sticks+Cans and makes noise when cannibals trip it  Floating Platforms-Only built on water, Cost less logs than regular platform but also require rope and a rock to anchor them"
TheForest,36txoz,NativeKiller,-1,Mon May 25 00:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yup. I've also thought about making a list for possible new contents for the game  such as the turtle shell armor, pitfall traps, etc.  However, I'd decided to give up on making such a list, when I realized that I had written down dozens of  ideas... and still had no sign of running out. (LOL)   Yup, that reminded me what a great potential this game has. :)   Also, glad to see that you've mentioned my previous suggestion of holsters :D"

They were building this massive base, and we all knew I'd get bored playing construction worker after a few in game days. So we decided early that I would be sort of the groups ranger. I scouted and made sure everyone had food. Built myself a tree base and lived slightly away from them. One day I had been out looking for things they asked me to find for my third day, and they were pretty low on food. Well, I had several legs from my scouting mission. I told them I'd rush back and start cooking. Waited till the legs were almost done and said ""Come get it, boys."" They rushed over and found two flaming legs on the fire. Both were surprised at first, then started cracking up and talking about how my character was a psychopath. Game may need more content, but it's a blast if played with people."

Deadly. Hotkeys for items would remove a bit of that. Part of the fear of being caught off guard is the fact that you HAVE to open your inventory, which takes up the entire screen, in order to do anything. It makes you think twice before pushing the button, and requires time and set up.  The more I looked at it from his perspective, the more I thought, ""Yes."""
TheForest,365y06,ItsKensterrr,1 point,Mon May 18 02:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, that perspective makes sense too, I've actually considered that point myself.   However, I eventually reached the conclusion that craftable holsters would STILL be a good idea for mainly two reasons;   firstly, since it would make more sense for the player character who crafts/builds all kinds of other stuff to craft something so useful,   secondly, for convenient gameplay.   Also it is true that  some items such as the 'lighter' can be equipped and used with a single press of a hotkey already.  Furthermore, in my opinion, the number of carriable holsters should probably limited to 2~3, in order to maintain the scary atmosphere, sense of realism, and game balance.   Thanks for your opinion though! It actually helped me explain my idea further! ;)"
TheForest,365y06,Piemasterjelly,2,Mon May 18 03:50:21 2015 UTC,Holster. Holds one melee weapon. Quiver. Lets you sling your bow over your back. Bandolier. Holds 3 bombs or molotovs.

TheForest,35s1ka,NativeKiller,3,Wed May 13 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"I've kind of been wondering... What if it turns out Timmy likes his captors and doesn't want to leave? Maybe they're worshipping him or something giving him all the toys and candy he wants. I hope there's going to be some kind of story coming soon, aside from ""you crashed here, they took your son, survive"". I knew what i got into when i decided to play a game in alpha, but the what-if's and theories are kind of fun"
TheForest,35s1ka,BUTCHER_206,2,Wed May 13 09:07:22 2015 UTC,"...Yeah, I've actually thought about that possibility too. What if Timmy actually likes his captors enough to become one of them? Scared the hell out of me since finding THAT out would pretty much be the worst possible thing that could happen to the main character. (Sadface)"
TheForest,35s1ka,BUTCHER_206,3,Wed May 13 09:13:22 2015 UTC,"Also, hopefully, the game would have a somewhat deeper story and setting than... well, what it currently has in its alpha development. Furthermore, it could also have multiple possible endings such as the golden ending where you successfully return home and live happily ever after with Timmy, the bittersweet ending where you manage to return to the civilized world with Timmy but die soon after from the toll that your body has taken while fighting the natives, and the nightmarish horror ending where you fight everything that stands in your way and finally manage to find Timmy, only to realize that he... has become one of THEM. Yup, this game just has so much potential at this point ;)"

TheForest,35rjns,ShhDontTellMom,7,Tue May 12 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"These are very good suggestions for realistic gameplay, however I'm not sure if they would all make for 'enjoyable' gameplay. IRL, you would most likely be more or less completely incapacitated after taking a gut shot without extra protection. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the same should apply to the main character of a FPS game. I'm not trying to start something though! Just thought I'd point this out :)"
TheForest,35rjns,NativeKiller,1 point,Tue May 12 23:09:54 2015 UTC,Also just realized that you mentioned me in your post! It's an honor that you took my suggestion seriously. ;)
TheForest,35rjns,NativeKiller,1 point,Tue May 12 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"Well, they were some pretty great suggestions! I see what you mean, but there aren't any guns in The Forest :P. In my opinion though, while some of these changes add short term annoyances, things like sleep depriving and hunger/hydration would make things less aggravating, while still essential."
TheForest,35rjns,NativeKiller,1 point,Tue May 12 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with quite some of your suggestions in this post, such as sleep deprivation! Also, I'm quite sure that the devs mentioned that they are planning for a weight-based inventory carrying limit. :)"
TheForest,35rjns,Darirol,4,Tue May 12 23:17:39 2015 UTC,i do not agree with all of your points  (realism... its a game where you fight mutant_zombi_alien things. how many mutants can an average adult fight simultanusly? how often can an average adult get hit in the face with an axe by an other average adult? how long does it take for an average adult to recover to full health after being hit by an axe 5 times? )  but you are right that the game right now is not much more then a grafic engine with some kind of backstory and almost everything that adds gameplay would make it better.
TheForest,35rjns,Eslader,4,Wed May 13 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"Removing timed explosives. I find it really stupid that you can just throw in a random chip with a molotov and a watch to create an actual bomb. wtf?   It's fairly likely that a bomb brought down the plane. Planes generally don't explode like that unless someone blows them up. The circuits you get off of that odd location in the plane would be a perfect place to plant the bomb that was a dud.   Shelter should be needed. In the wild, you WILL die after 24 hours of exposure.   No you won't. It's obviously summer on this island. It's not difficult to survive outside in the summer in a temperate climate zone from an exposure point of view. Hell I've done camping where I spent 3 weeks never going inside anything, not even a tent. I didn't die.  It looks like the devs are planning destructible bases, and the cannibals will be able to break them too, so that should give you stuff to do after you build your large base."
TheForest,35rjns,mantann,2,Thu May 14 14:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the huge base thing. My best run I built a tree home near a deer spawn point, set up a turtle catcher, and was set to go for however long I felt like going.  I'm not so sure the game needs more risk so much as it currently has no form of objective to keep you from simply being done after you create a sustainable living environment. In don't starve it takes a while to create a perfect base, and without doing something damn near perfect you might freeze to death, might be killed by fire dog things, or could run out of food while trying to keep from freezing. Plus, if you build too big and don't do lightning rods your whole base could catch on fire. There are events that keep you on your toes despite much inherent risk from your hunter/gather activities.   Tl;Dr: You feel done after base building because you pretty much are. More additions to the game will probably fix that without making trees more annoying and rocks suddenly weigh crap tons."

I was also half expecting a little dig when you said you were inspecting your inventory. That's when i noticed that the bright red plane axe i first found in the body of the stewardess, that i had spent so much time turning blue, was red again. ""Am i losing my mind? "" i thought? I spent so much time mashing up the skin of blueberries i collected, mixing the concentrate into tree sap and coating that bright red obnoxious thing. The natives were spotting it from miles away. I even adhered some shards of broken glass, to really show those bastards what for, and that wasn't there either. ""Maybe i didn't.... maybe i have lost my mind. It's hard to remember."" What was that stewardess name again... Tori? Tara? Tina? Despite the brief interaction i had with her on the plane, i can tell she had been a good person who didn't deserve her violent fate. To survive the crash... only to be axed by one of those freaks. Life can be ridiculous and cruel... i wont let that happen to you Timmy."

You can't place a trap on one side of the island and come back later.  The animals only spawn within a certain distance of you so best place for a trap is near where you spend most of your time. Your base or where you cut wood is best.

Make sure you are using the right engine (there is a tweak option now for old version or new).  Your game is not meant to look anywhere near that bad. But its normal for overall quality to drop slightly when switching engines."

TheForest,353ei3,Eslader,-2,Wed May 6 20:10:24 2015 UTC,shrug I trusted the opinions of people who gave it an Overwhelmingly Positive review. Apparently they were easily impressed.
TheForest,353ei3,Eslader,10,Wed May 6 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"For an early access game, it was, and still is, extremely impressive. Reviews on early access games are looking at how good the game is for the absurdly early stage of development that it's being played in. They should not be interpreted to mean the game would get the same review if it were a full release in exactly the same condition that it's in as an alpha.   Alpha means feature incomplete and lots of bugs. The worst problem with the early access trend is that people buy in and fail to read any of the notices plastered all over the sales screen.  Early Access is so that you can get a game at a significant discount in exchange for putting up with an in-development game rather than getting a full game at release. It's expected that you are aware of the fact that there will be bugs, and it's even expected that you report them when you find them rather than refusing to play the game because there are bugs.   You must have missed the two notices that are front and center on The Forest's sale screen:   Early Access Game Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.  Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development. Learn more  What the developers have to say:  “The Forest is an Early Access title. It is currently still under heavy development with new features being added on a regular basis. Currently there will be bugs, locked off content, missing features and other possibly serious game breaking issues.  Please only purchase the game during this stage if you want to help support development and provide feedback and suggestions to the team."
TheForest,353ei3,Luniaril,-7,Wed May 6 20:21:00 2015 UTC,"shrug It's pretty and all but I didn't see the gameplay as all that impressive. Don't Starve is in the same genre (albeit a different style/perspective) and sucked me in way more than this did. Granted Don't Starve I believe is a lot older but also Rust and 7 Days to Die were more interesting to me.  Like I said before, in b4 early access. This is the game that pretty much killed doing anything early access again. Yeah I get it's a dev build but if you want to go the minecraft route you have to fix the game breaking stuff along the way or people are just going to bail."

Thanks for replying by the way!
TheForest,34wrfr,epoch91,1 point,Tue May 5 17:10:45 2015 UTC,No problem. Yea i got this card mainly because it was cheap and i needed a new GPU asap because mine crapped out and I still had projects to do on my PC so i had no choice haha.   The hotfix they pushed out last night was suppose to help performance but it didnt help at all.   I thought maybe its just that the game and this specific GPU don't get along now on Unity 5. But other games that have updated to Unity 5 run so much smoother were they use to play worse (The Long Dark and Kerbal Space Program). And I do remember reading that others with the same GPU run the game smoothly.

TheForest,34vht3,NativeKiller,1 point,Mon May 4 22:23:33 2015 UTC,It seems handy since you could use all of the normal rocks for building and still have the upgraded rock to use for stealth killing... But then again I haven't bothered stealth killing for months :D

TheForest,34svwb,Eugenes_Axe,-19,Mon May 4 13:52:24 2015 UTC,"Ok this post touches on something I've been thinking about for a while now, regarding early access games.  1) ""Wondering when the 'deconstruction' feature would be introduced""  2) ""...looking forward to the day when the feature is introduced...""  3) ""...it's taking much longer ... than what I had expected...""  I'm going to say it, here it goes:  ""Entitlement"".  I think it's reasonable to assume that we all would like to see a deconstruction feature, I also think it's quite likely that the finished game will contain this feature. BUT! Unless someone can show me otherwise, I do not believe the developers have said that this feature will certainly exist in the finished product.   The language of your post assumes that the feature is coming (quotes 1 and 2), and on to of that, that you feel it should have happened sooner (quote 3). The entire point of your post seems to be ""Why isn't this feature I want in yet?"" and I see this rife in the gaming community with early access games.  It's an easy trap to fall into, you're playing an EA game, and run into a snag game-play wise, something that isn't as smooth as you'd expect, or you have the desire to express agency in a way not yet available. You solve the problem in your head right there ""Gee if only I could remove these buildings, I could..."", or ""If I could carry water I'd be able to ..."", and so on. I've been there, we all have.  But! At the point you transition from thinking ""This would be a nice feature, I hope the finished game has it"" to expecting the feature, you've crossed a line into entitlement. Developers have a vision in mind for the finished product, and it won't always align with our imagined finished product. This is OK, this is a good thing.  I'm sorry if this comes across as if I've lept down your throat OP. You posted a fairly innocuous question and got this monster of a reply. It's just the language of your post touched on a feeling I've been having for a while (I was actually thinking of posting these thoughts to /r/truegaming this weekend, but got caught up with work). To answer your question, Yes I do think this feature is likely to end up in the finished product. I have no idea when (if at all) it will arrive in early access, but as programmer myself, I'd like to mention that the complexity of the feature might not be the only reason it's not developed. The developers might want to accomplish other things beforehand, or, they might not want to add it at all.  TLDR: Early access games are unfinished, and we intuitively fill in the gaps as we play. But our imagined finished product is not necessarily what the developers have in mind. They may wish to solve the problem in a different way, or not at all. They may want the player to struggle. Therefore expecting features that have not been confirmed by the developers is erroneous."
TheForest,34svwb,Eugenes_Axe,10,Mon May 4 13:32:56 2015 UTC,I actually just read from the Q&A section that they are planning to introduce the deconstruction feature though. :D

Most features run as well as in single player, with most of the frustrating earlier coop bugs removed. You can share items that occur on player screens (cans of drink, snacks) by building a snackbar. Caves no longer destroy coop games (in my experience).  Its worth while for a few hours of mucking about, I wouldn't recommend making a more permanent dwelling with your friends yet."

TheForest,34ggd9,NativeKiller,0,Thu Apr 30 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming some multiplayer issues will be addressed, such as latency, problems where only hosts can interact and perform certain tasks, such as collecting rabbits from traps and hitting with projectiles.  I believe the switch to the Unity engine also broke two caves, as there are many points where you will begin swimming randomly through the air and eventually drown in some cases.   I'm also hoping they release the few recipes in the book that are currently unusable, such as the custom structures and the rope.

Doesn't kill you outright, but you can hear it following you, see glimpses of shadows as it moves around your base, until ultimately it gets you"
TheForest,3497mt,rokerboy220,2,Wed Apr 29 13:30:24 2015 UTC,Exactly. Something enigmatic yet clearly deadly almost to the point of being inescapable. Introducing such an antagonist that is even more powerful than yourself would be a great way to enhance the feeling of survival horror.
TheForest,3497mt,weliveinayellowsub,3,Wed Apr 29 13:37:53 2015 UTC,"Not quite like that. A cannibal that watches you. He looks different. Wears an intricate headband. He follows you. If you chase him, he climbs a tree and jumps away. But he comes back. And the longer he watches, the more cannibals show up at places you frequent.  Only problem is fire arrows and molotovs being OP at the moment."
TheForest,3497mt,Moloshe,3,Thu Apr 30 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"Uh, personally I wouldn't be afraid of any normal native even if one looks a bit different, wears an intricate headband and rallys another hundred natives. A hundred natives may take quite some effort and resources to deal with but rather than being fearsome they would end up being merely annoying. In my opinion, one faceless horror could be much more horryfing than a hundred generic antagonists. Also I agree that fire weapons are overpowered at the moment but I believe that the devs would eventually balance stuff when the game is finished being organized :)"
TheForest,3497mt,Nervules,3,Thu Apr 30 03:06:42 2015 UTC,"a lot of people suggested that the cannibal who takes your kid in the intro is the leader, and that he has genitals whereas all the other male  cannibals have none or something like that."
TheForest,3497mt,Moloshe,5,Thu Apr 30 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"I totally agree! I've kind of pushed this game away for the moment because it's not really, well.. scary. Of course it's quite frightening when you hear the spotted music, but once you know where the cannibal is it's just an easy hit, then run back, and repeat.   I can imagine the cannibals have adapted to ""The Forest"", so I'd love to see them come in hordes, maybe some jumping from tree-to-tree to chase you down. I want them to actually chase me! You know? That feeling you get when getting chased on Amnesia or Outlast, it's horrific. But it would work so well with The Forest, especially since the cannibals just walk towards you, and don't even chase you.  I'd love to see stalking implemented, can you imagine being stalked for days on end by cannibals? If you ran to them in attempt to kill them they just sprint away, after a couple of days they circle you, maybe you're cutting a tree down, or something like that. Stalking is a definite for this game, there is no way they could leave that out.  The atmosphere is great, don't get me wrong. But when I'm running in the night, or building, cutting trees, I want to hear noises. I know there's a couple of screeches here and there, but grunting, growling, and even the cannibals running at you whilst screeching would be terrifying. I really hope they implement some of the ideas the community has given them. This game, in a sense, could knock out every other survival horror game with ease if done right."
TheForest,3497mt,Moloshe,2,Wed Apr 29 17:22:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree completely. Being stalked would be a tense yet satisfying survival horror experience."

TheForest,341bu8,Moloshe,4,Mon Apr 27 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"i've been playing .16 for quite some time now, pissing them off as much as i possibly can, and i haven't found anything like this before. i know that certain areas of the island have greater significance to them, tho.  my current build is near two of the survivor campsites where they've made some er... art... out of the corpses, and they seem to visit those areas pretty frequently. they even walk right past my base which is visibly lit up with dozens of standing fires and seem to specifically seek out those areas. I've also noticed that when i leave closed suitcases around and they patrol past them, they are generally opened and salvaged by the time i get there, so they may be going to these campsites for the item drops rather than some sort of ritual significance, tho. I know they frequently drop soda cans, but im not sure if that's a random drop or if they genuinely need to find those items and carry them in their inventory."

And I have to admit... I felt a solid amount of fear. After all that time keeping quiet and hidden and just building myself a nice home, the thought of being exposed didn't excite me. And I wasn't looking forward to ending that day with some cannibal ravaging my camp. I thank the lucky forest stars that didn't happen, of course.  I think that after so many hours of this game, and so many other survival games with building/crafting mechanics, what I appreciate most is having an enemy faction with patterns that take time and courage to truly understand.

Then I was fishing in a pond and the game played the ""spotted"" music sting. The feral quickly ran away, and since then I've seen groups of four or five searching.  Just my experience."

I think the largest pack we ran into was 4 cannibals. Once we started exploring caves, we found a few berserkers, but that was about it.  I really hope that they either have a manual difficulty slider that they add in at a later date, or have the number of cannibals encountered naturally scale up with the number of players in the game."

I've actually been looking for new ways to attract them myself because im trying to kill as many as possible with fire traps in my latest save, and i think the most effective thing besides lurking around their homes is to leave a lot of corpses outside your base when you find them, then kill the ferals that come to feed on them, leaving more corpses, etc etc. it seems like if you leave more than 3 or 4 nearby, there will always be a feral there. Another thing i've considered but havent tired yet is building around the great trees, because they are definitely kind of sacred to the cannibals or something"

TheForest,344swo,Prof_Doom,5,Tue Apr 28 15:11:21 2015 UTC,Yes - this always makes me sad. People think it's an easy task that just upgrades everything to a better product instantly with a simple import. It's not like that. Especially changeing from UNity 4.x to 5.x means retouching and upgrading all existing textures to the new system. All the textures. And that's only a part from the art side of things.

Perhaps, once the game is fully released and mostly bug free, they could add an option to choose where you were flying to and from, and the plane would randomly crash over that area.  That way, you could end up in a desert, or island chain, or jungle, or forest, or even an abandoned city.   Done right, this feature could put almost every survival game out of buisness."

That's not to say that there isn't any value to the idea, but implementing anything has time costs associated with it and changes have to be more valuable than the other options to be worth consideration.  The temperate forest setting has a high degree of resonance for me and I think this is crucial to cultivate a sense of immersion, which is crucial to the game"
TheForest,340py0,ElectricAlan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:44:06 2015 UTC,It would simply add more survival options.  Desert survival is a differant beast than Temperate Forest.   One feature I would love to see is seasons.
TheForest,340py0,BlueSmoke95,2,Mon Apr 27 22:02:20 2015 UTC,"if you want practical island based gameplay, you inevitably need the cannibals to build boats. this probably means having functional boats for the player as well (cus in .15 the raft worked just fine and i cant get it to move an inch in .16). urban areas would involve developing a tonnn of new resources and crafting items because there obviously would be a lot of new materials available in such an environment, but that said, i'm hoping all this will be added regardless, because it doesnt make sense that you cant build anything out of the shit tons of scrap metal that are lying around everywhere, and i really want to get that arena rock cassette tape from the boat with the modern axe lol"
TheForest,340py0,Moloshe,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:29:54 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on how the term tropical is interpreted. Tropical doesn't have to mean paradise. It could just be a giant island you're stranded on that happens to have palm trees instead of your standard oak looking tree. There's no reason that the dark atmosphere or gloomy appearance would need to change.

TBH i think the main reason the suitcases respawn is for explosives, because when i assumed booze and cloth and circuit boards were not renewable, i literally used no explosives whatsoever   because i wanted to save them for absolute emergencies"

The sun is setting and I decide to go to bed.  Try to pass time again, but can't.  I look outside and it is a goddamn battlefield between starving cannibals and the regular ones probably 10-15 in total.  Decide to wait it out and kill whoever is left.

One of the viewers made note that it was the first stream of The Forest they had watched that wasn't laggy.  What are your OBS settings set to? What's your monitor resolution?"
TheForest,33tow6,ItsKensterrr,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:36:01 2015 UTC,My resolution is 1920x1080 and my OBS settings are the same resolution and 30 FPS. I even downscaled everything within The Forest and restarted it and it still didn't help at all. It was so bad the stream would freeze on one picture and stay there until I paused the game.

However since release a year or so ago people have had to restart their games several times.

The saves work somewhat, he keeps his inventory now he just always spawns on the plane like a new player and can re-loot everything there, it's somewhat weird and inconvenient with all the disconnects cause he'll spawn in the middle of the woods alone away from the base during night."

Whenever you reconnect, whoever isn't hosting will spawn by default and always (for now) in the plane. The suitcases and stuff also sadly regenerate every game-load which makes resources too common. This is alpha though, so when we agreed to pay the money for early access... this is what we get. Personally I like seeing the bugs etc, because you get to see the transition within the game over time. Quite satisfying."

TheForest,33p636,CivilianNumberFour,10,Fri Apr 24 18:28:25 2015 UTC,It's still associated with it. When humans eat each other over an extended period of time a similar prion disease occurs.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism

TheForest,33p636,CivilianNumberFour,2,Fri Apr 24 20:43:18 2015 UTC,A mutant version of one of those diseases was what happened in the Dead Island games
TheForest,33p636,Civil_Barbarian,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:22:30 2015 UTC,"No, it's from eating self replicating proteins that convert a necessary brain protein into an obstructive one. Usually it's from cannibalism and rarely not (cow-human). Though since cows don't eat meat they might be more susceptible to developing prion diseases.  Mad cow disease isn't the only prion disease. Kuru is very similar but came as a result of human on human cannibalism."
TheForest,33p636,Chimp-Spirit,3,Tue Apr 28 20:46:39 2015 UTC,I think it'd be awesome if you slowly started turning tribal. Maybe after doing it too much you start to get hunger pains if you don't eat human meat every couple of days. Then eventually regular food stops filling your hunger bar and you can only survive on human flesh. Maybe give a different ending too

The creature or spirit could either possess characteristics of a human or a monster that had physically transformed from a person. It is particularly associated with cannibalism. The Algonquian believed those who indulged in eating human flesh were at particular risk;  the legend appears to have reinforced the taboo of the practice of cannibalism. It is often described in Algonquian mythology as a balance of nature.     Interesting: Wendigo (comics) | Blahbalicious | Supernatural (season 1)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

That said, Reddit is also infested with idiots who downvote shit just for the hell of it. This sub isn't really bad at all in that aspect - there are some where anything you say is almost guaranteed to be downvoted for no reason.  I've found it best to not worry much about up/downvotes.

It got to the point where I'd be attacked by 2-4 of them at a time.  Also, it seemed that if I stopped rampaging and kept my head down the island-wide 'aggression metre' (if there is such a thing) went down, and I'd have quiet nights again.

There are wrecked boats. And despite the apparent likely dozens of people that have been here before, none have survived long enough to become more than a macabre lawn decoration.  In other words, it's a trap. I wouldn't guess a curse--the game doesn't have any hint of the mystic, only the unnatural.  Someone guessed that the island and its inhabitants are the ""project"" of unethical scientists/long-abandoned secret government testing/etc. If that's so, I would guess it was an EMP. That would cripple vital electronics on the plane and the yacht, forcing a crash-landing or stranding sailors with no option but to go ashore."
TheForest,33ixyv,Eslader,3,Thu Apr 23 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"I would say a bomb. Planes generally don't break up in smooth air like that unless someone blows them up. Occasionally one will crack apart in a severe thunderstorm, but we're flying through clear, nonturbulent air just before the breakup.   The nature of the breakup is, to me, very reminiscent of the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Even metal fatigue wouldn't explain the complete breakup that this plane experiences. You might lose some skin panels like what happened to Aloha Airlines back in the 80's. In that one, a piece of roof paneling broke loose due to metal fatigue, which caused an explosive decompression that ripped the top half of the fuse skin off for a long chunk of the front of the plane. The plane still landed safely because the underlying structure did not break apart.  The presence of non-connected circuit boards right near where the fuse breakup is (the two that you pick up after you get off the plane right at the beginning to make time bombs with) adds to the bomb theory - a plane wouldn't have boards like that in that position as part of its design."

Maybe a small trailer of what they have so far on PS4 at E3, nothing more.  I agree they are still pretty far away from anything that's playable, that's if they even have anything yet."
TheForest,33j0h0,Trankman,2,Thu Apr 23 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah maybe, but the game is so young, i wouldnt get your hopes up for anything ps4 for at least another year."
TheForest,33g8co,Ultimasnk,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:10:08 2015 UTC,They seem to appear in higher numbers when you let some run away in a fight.
TheForest,33g8co,mazdarati2,2,Wed Apr 22 07:30:36 2015 UTC,I've had plenty run away from me. A couple of times I've agitated them just so they'd run and tell someone. I just hope my games not bugged somehow . I've been playing since purchase. I've got I think 10 ish hours in and 20 or so days survived.
TheForest,33g8co,NativeKiller,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:33:57 2015 UTC,"In my case, they seem to appear heavily when you kill some and let some runaway and wait for them to come back with reinforcements at night. Lighting effigies seem to increase their numbers. Just my two cents. :)"
TheForest,33g8co,NativeKiller,2,Wed Apr 22 08:13:51 2015 UTC,"I had set up camp in the middle of a large native camp with dozens of large effigies lit on fire before just to pick on a fight. After sometime at night, 20~30 natives attacked me in a single wave."
TheForest,33g8co,BUTCHER_206,3,Wed Apr 22 08:24:03 2015 UTC,Dude seriously? This whole time ive been building effigies to ward them away but its baiting them?
TheForest,33g8co,NativeKiller,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:47:20 2015 UTC,IMO burning effigies tend to eventually attract large groups of enemies while unlit effigies may sometimes discourage small numbers of natives from approaching.

TheForest,33cxzt,NativeKiller,7,Tue Apr 21 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"It's an alpha game. They need to get the elements programmed before they start tweaking the numbers. The fire arrow makes things survivable until they tweak the axes so they do more damage. Axes take 2 chops to behead a corpse, but 8 hits to knock a live cannibal down. In a multi-cannibal fight, you are probably going to lose if you go after them with an axe.  In short, sure, the fire arrows are OP, but everything else is underpowered. Let the devs get the house's foundation laid before they start hanging the drapes. ;)"
TheForest,33cxzt,Eslader,2,Tue Apr 21 18:20:16 2015 UTC,Makes sense :D
TheForest,33cxzt,LHandrel,2,Tue Apr 21 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"They are OP. I would be okay with nerfing it I they upped the damage normal arrows do--against natives, you might as well be throwing pebbles (in my experience). Combat in general needs better balancing, IMO, but I'm cool with it for now since its just an alpha game for now.  Haven't used bow sights yet, but I actually didn't know arrows didn't arc until I saw news about the sights. Would explain my awful long-range shots."

TheForest,33c3c0,NativeKiller,2,Tue Apr 21 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that if I sneak up to a cannibal in a cave, they notice me when I get within about 5-10 feet even if I don't make any noise and am coming from behind them. I suspect it's because the rebreather is throwing light and the cannibals turn around to see what it is.   I cannot compare how soon the cannibal would turn around without the rebreather in the cave because I can't see anything. ;)"
TheForest,33c3c0,Eslader,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:22:43 2015 UTC,The cannibals are quite blind actually. I can approach them until I am RIGHT behind them while I am carrying a lit lighter and a bow with a flaming arrow sitting on it. So I guess the scuba gear's light does attract attention.

I think I had to find the local save files on my computer, which are in two different places I believe, and delete those as well.

I think because the cave is a ""different"" area of the game than the overworld and needs to load when you cross into the cave. By not going through the entrance nothing loads in the cave. No mobs, no water, no items on the ground, no rope to climb back up(meaning saving a game down there is useless since you can't get back out), collisionless items like stalactites/stalagmites don't load in either."

TheForest,32v68m,kenmaclean,3,Thu Apr 16 23:50:25 2015 UTC,Upgrade your axe with  tree sap and teeth/booze for damage and sap plus feathers for a faster swing. Once you get a very upgraded axe you can 2/3 shot cannibals
TheForest,32v68m,Cpt_seal_clubber,2,Fri Apr 17 02:57:44 2015 UTC,sap plus feathers for attack speed? SINCE WHEN WAS THIS A THING. THATS AMAZING.
TheForest,32v68m,UACR6,3,Fri Apr 17 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"v0.08: ..., First pass at infinite weapon upgrading added, .... Patch release: Oct. 8th 2014  You can add glass (booze/bottles), teeth and feathers. Sap + One of these items = +1 upgrade to whatever you added. Teeth increase damage but slow the weapon down. Feathers increase the attack speed. I haven't seen glass have any real effect since I haven't used it in a while."
TheForest,32v68m,Cpt_seal_clubber,2,Fri Apr 17 03:45:20 2015 UTC,Psh attack speed.... I think your missing the true importance wood cutting speed
TheForest,32v68m,lwelle,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"When your crafted axe finally hits that tribal they should be destroyed; a hit to the arm should remove that arm, a hit to the neck should decapitate them, a hit to the guts should disembowel them.   It is a rock haphazardly tied to a stick."
TheForest,32v68m,Tucster,1 point,Fri May 1 21:37:30 2015 UTC,"yeah, a big jagged rock on the end of a stick will fuck up anything that isn't armoured. Removing limbs might be a stretch, but it'd break their bones and cut their muscles to ribbons, the limb wouldn't function."
TheForest,32v68m,bobsizzlack,1 point,Fri May 1 21:46:54 2015 UTC,This is the truest post I've seen on here. They get even harder as the game goes on and all I can do is use fire to stop them. Maybe with this new jump attack it will get easier
TheForest,32v68m,the_whining_beaver,-1,Fri Apr 17 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"it's a HORROR game, you're SUPPOSED to feel helpless and pathetic. If it were easier to fend off the cannibals with your bare fists and tools, there'd be no incentive to stay hidden, build somewhere to make yourself safe. This game is not a HD remake of Minecraft.   That said, there should be clear pros and cons of each axe type, as thus far there's no real point to collecting all of them, let alone using them for different things."
TheForest,32v68m,bobsizzlack,2,Fri Apr 17 11:57:37 2015 UTC,"I'm an intelligent, full grown man with a steel axe and thick lizard hide armour.  I think I should be able to take on one half starved naked woman fighting with her bare fists, don't you?"
TheForest,32v68m,old_mold,3,Fri Apr 17 12:24:42 2015 UTC,"intelligent   Irrelivent in this setting   ""full grown man with a steel axe and thick lizard hide armour... take on one half starved naked woman fighting with her bare fists""   Full grown, probably  malnourished, civilized man with morals, a steel axe, and lizard skin partially covering his body vs a hardened cannibal native with no morals who acts based on pure instinct to survive... That's a tough one, but the axe alone should give you the upper hand.   ""...a hit to the arm should remove that arm, a hit to the neck should decapitate them""   Ever tried to cut through bone (prepped a deer or two :p )? It is not easy to sever joints through brute force alone.    hit to the guts should disembowel them   That I agree with, probably not (as easily) with the place axe but defiantly with the modern, rusty, and pick axes.    On a side not could we please have arrowheads modeled onto the arrows? They have them in the inventory so why not when you're using them? Feels odd killing a native with blunt, not even sharpened, arrow."
TheForest,32v68m,bobsizzlack,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:27:48 2015 UTC,"you've just been in a plane crash, you're likely suffering from shock, possibly not used to the climate, you're not used to the surroundings, dazed, confused, constantly shaking from adrenaline. No, I do not believe you'd be able to take on a native who has survived into adulthood in the conditions they attack you in. Anyone who's been in a car crash, let alone a plane crash, will tell you just how weak and tired you get from your body shutting down in panic ready for impact. I came off my bike as a teenager doing 34mph down a hill, and even after sustaining no major injuries (helmets ftw) I couldn't walk properly for over an hour.   If it was a cannibal invasion on the protagonist's home, then sure, he'd be used to the surroundings, fit and healthy, in his comfort zone, and would no doubt have the upper hand. This is not the setting of this game."
TheForest,32rd9g,NikkuRydell,8,Thu Apr 16 02:27:34 2015 UTC,Hope the devs didn't catch too much grief over the delays. Most devs don't tell you when updates will be released and I can see why after seeing people bouncing off the walls waiting for the update. I don't know many devs that have been as open and upfront as they have been about the progress of the update but I hope they don't stop. Looking forward to these updates is like looking looking forward to a holiday or something.
TheForest,32rd9g,CitizenBonks,11,Thu Apr 16 03:16:38 2015 UTC,Fuck the whiners. The devs are doing their best and are allowed to make some mistakes.
TheForest,32rd9g,BeARdBARIAN,6,Thu Apr 16 05:56:05 2015 UTC,Very smooth.  Some collision issues on the new plane (seats hanging out in thin air) but so far everything feels much more fluid.
TheForest,32rd9g,ChikkaChiChi,4,Thu Apr 16 02:50:18 2015 UTC,Entire world feels so much more alive!  This is awesome.
TheForest,32rd9g,ChikkaChiChi,3,Thu Apr 16 02:59:04 2015 UTC,"It really is amazingly smooth to play, wow."
TheForest,32rd9g,Varvino,6,Thu Apr 16 08:05:54 2015 UTC,I think there's a rendering issue because textures look muddled to me from a distance.  Everything further than around a couple of metres looks extremely blurred.  Graphics are maxed out on my settings too.  So far this runs much smoother than 0.15 though!
TheForest,32rd9g,Relaptic,3,Thu Apr 16 02:48:55 2015 UTC,"Check the new detail settings, if you haven't already. these are new and wont be set  to max if you didn't change them yourself"
TheForest,32rd9g,SurvivalistGaming,3,Thu Apr 16 02:52:44 2015 UTC,I've actually customized them all to put them on their highest setting!
TheForest,32rd9g,Relaptic,3,Thu Apr 16 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"Having this problem too, grass seems to fade even though it's on max settings."

TheForest,32rd9g,LuckyDestoster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:02:10 2015 UTC,I have a friend who accidentally kept saying Kappa at the end of his sentences because he was so used to using Twitch that he'd do it in Steam. It's not so far-fetched to believe that /u/LuckyDestoster did the same thing.
TheForest,32rd9g,Nanemae,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:41:55 2015 UTC,Thats hilarious. I could see how people could get into the habit of doing things like that. But my case was just general stupidity lol.

TheForest,32tn69,Unspoken_Myth,5,Thu Apr 16 16:52:43 2015 UTC,Yes. Best alpha game out there imo.
TheForest,32tn69,slrrp,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:11:50 2015 UTC,Yes. It is a lot of fun and even  more with friends. This is the only 'scary' game I want to play.
TheForest,32tn69,mazdarati2,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would definitely wait for full release.  However, if you're not the type to get burnt out on these alpha games, then get it.  It's a really cool game and has huge potential, the only problem with it is it lacks features and content right now.  My best advice really is to wait.  For me, this is not one of those alpha games that I can play all through development and still be excited about when it releases, which is why I haven't played it in about 4-5 months until yesterday; Played a bit yesterday and today, they've made some really great progress, but I'm going to put it back on the shelf for several more months before I play again.  I REALLY do not want to burn myself out on this game, as I'm really looking forward to the full release."
TheForest,32tn69,TheRegretfulBandit,-2,Fri Apr 17 19:11:06 2015 UTC,Hmm.. These are some very convincing comments..
TheForest,32tn69,SwanX17,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"Give us something to go on.  Do you like survival games?  Do you mind pre-alpha quality gameplay?  Have you played games similar to this?  What drew you to this game in the first place?  How important is dev interaction to you?    You can't just come in and say, ""should I buy this game?""  and give us nothing else to go on. That's like asking if you should try quiche."
TheForest,32tn69,SwanX17,2,Thu Apr 16 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've had quiche. Should I try quiche?   Lmao, but yes. I do like survival games. As long as the quality doesn't destroy the gameplay then its no problem at all. I came upon this game from the random button, and it looks interesting, just wondering if its worth the money."
TheForest,32tn69,Liamb2179,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:31:04 2015 UTC,No.  You should not try quiche.  Well as far as survival games go it has a massive amount of potential.  There are regular updates that are bringing the game closer to final product.  However some of the patches are more playable than others.  The multipayer works well enough to have fun if you have a good group.  The single player is also a blast because the fear factor is so much higher.  The mutants have a pretty neat AI system that makes for interesting gameplay.  This game does involve chopping up mutants and using their body parts to build effigies... so yeah.  The graphics are pretty good.  I love it. If the things I listed above sound good to you then pick it up!  Or at least follow it on steam so you can see when the game gets to a point where you feel like it's worth playing.

TheForest,32ram9,Geoslug,2,Thu Apr 16 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"There's a few ""plane spawn scenarios"" that are listed on that map. Basically once you crash you just have to figure out which one you are, then you can know what direction to go for certain things. Use the sunrise and sunset to your advantage, its realistic!  edit: in the Unity 5 0.16 update I do not believe this map is accurate. Only played about 20 minutes though, so not 100% sure."

TheForest,32qnf3,joshsdinosaur,3,Wed Apr 15 22:53:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm protips... In the early stages avoid natives or take a risk and go for the axe in there village. Don't explore caves without armor. Dont't explore at night  Don't think your invincible cuz cause you built a few walls,just wait till you meat Armsy. Effigies or what ever are life savers. Traps are underrated. Currently the safest stronghold would be tree houses. Make sure you choose a convenient location for your house(that it has access to both the forest and open terrain also i would be nice to have water near by. Molotovs are great for taking out large numbers of natives. If the 2 scouts(a pair of natives wondering around) a find you make sure they don't go back home if they do expect a horde coming your way.(some may doubt this and claim that if you kill them it will just provoke them witch in my case wasn't the outcome) Make sure you always have a decent food supply(Drying racks ar.e awesome!!!) Use gardens to grow herbs used for crafting healing potions. Also one huge protip..listen to other peoples advices.This subreddit is filled with well i woudn't say veteran players but you get what am i aiming at.They are always here to help you or attend your quarries.

Bushes, shrubs, and anything that is cut down with normal axe swings will regenerate after a certain time (i think) or on reloading a save (definitely).  I'd like to see them expand in this area myself.  Also, before you ask; no, stumps cannot be removed in any way at the moment."

TheForest,32od6t,BlueSmoke95,3,Wed Apr 15 12:40:04 2015 UTC,"Perhaps take a que from Minecraft and allow players to gather seeds.  That way, we can plant trees where we want them, and avoid trees randomly growing in out base."
TheForest,32od6t,Eugenes_Axe,2,Wed Apr 15 14:29:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think it would really add to the game. I'm sure I've seen somewhere that they're looking to expand upon it, but I cannot find that right now."

TheForest,32gy1p,Eugenes_Axe,7,Mon Apr 13 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, your base puts mine to shame. I started off with a cabin, then wanted to wall it off to keep the cannibals away. Once I realized they could no-clip through the walls if I'm not looking in that direction I decided to try and make an elevated backup area I could retreat to and rain down fire arrows on any invaders. Your base is pretty inspiring man, I love the elevated platform with the bridge going to it, I think I'll use that idea. Mine ended up so sloppy I have to kind of parkour myself up it lol  Here's a quick tour of mine"
TheForest,32gy1p,raskolnikov206,3,Mon Apr 13 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"Oh man I just watched your video, that journey to the top is quite something! At 0:26, it looks as if you could attach a rope to the left platform to get up easier.   This is like my 5th world started, and I've learnt painful lessons about what works well in the game at the moment, and more importantly, what doesn't. I.e. stairs, I hate stairs at the moment. I think the issue stems from the fact that if you're not already moving forward when you jump, you don't jump forward. It feels like there's not enough 'inertia' in the player for smooth navigation of some structures and caves.   Anyway, I had a few ideas of what I wanted going in (to be 100% safe, i.e. off the ground), but let it grow organically as my needs dictate. I save before placing any logs into a structure so I can undo mistakes, also I take an absolute age placing blueprints!"
TheForest,32gy1p,raskolnikov206,3,Mon Apr 13 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the rope tip! I haven't used one before and had no idea I could do that.. would've saved me a ton of hassle, live and learn  Haha yeah you nailed it exactly; I learned all these same lessons as I built this base. I hate stairs and the caves and rocks too and agree about the jumping and inertia. It wasn't in the video because I was leaving the cabin but when entering I actually have to jump onto that little 1foot high floor part, then jump onto the stairs too just to get in the front door. Its pretty scary with cannibals running around in my base and I'm frantically trying to get in my cabin but can't lol.   I started saving before placing any logs into structures too after learning if you make benches in certain spots you don't actully sit on the bench, but sit like 6 feet behind it in midair, lol. All in all taking an absolute age to place blueprints is the best thing you can do... better to spend that extra time than resetting a 10+ hour game cause its so sloppy like mine is and you finally can't stand it lol."
TheForest,32gy1p,reconchrist,5,Mon Apr 13 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"With v0.16 just round the corner, and there being some degree on uncertainty whether our saves will transfer (I suspect they will), let's see your bases!

TheForest,32gy1p,clusterfact,2,Mon Apr 13 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"This is Single Player, as tree bridges are not in MP yet. That said, you simply build two raised platforms, then select the tree bridge from the build menu, then aim at the first edge, you'll see a white log blueprint snap on, left click, then aim at the second edge (on the other platform) and you'll see a string of logs stretch out between the two.

TheForest,32dmeb,ChikkaChiChi,8,Sun Apr 12 22:34:42 2015 UTC,I really like the blueprint system also but I think it has a long way to go to reach its full potential.
TheForest,32dmeb,Solodynasty,5,Sun Apr 12 23:09:51 2015 UTC,Absolutely but you can see the developers have very good foundation to build on.
TheForest,32dmeb,Escapee334,7,Mon Apr 13 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure. I didn't mean to imply that it wasn't a wonderful system, I meant that its a good base for a system that has a ton of room for expansion, which is absolutely critical for the game they are designing."
TheForest,32dmeb,Solodynasty,10,Mon Apr 13 01:38:49 2015 UTC,yeah it really sets itself apart in that aspect
TheForest,32dmeb,abigassbrick,2,Sun Apr 12 23:01:52 2015 UTC,"I think it could be improved if they added a grid like system like Minecraft does. Do the same blanket and inventory screen, you just have to put things where they belong."
TheForest,32dmeb,itsdietz,3,Mon Apr 13 08:21:25 2015 UTC,I think minecraft can afford to do that shit because there are so many wacky crafting recipes. Whereas the forest should be more straightforward so it's not awkward
TheForest,329ohj,Dinosaur_Monkey,3,Sat Apr 11 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"Every bush randomly spawns one of the three different berries.  There's some bushes on the separate large island in the south east, and some of the eastern shore south of where the tribal huts are on the east coast."
TheForest,329ohj,Tibula,2,Sun Apr 12 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Berry bushes have fixed locations on the island, when you load a game the type of berry is (seemingly) randomly chosen, for the duration of that session that bush will produce that type of berry. I have some bushes next to my base and it's a good day when they're producing blueberries."
TheForest,329ohj,Eugenes_Axe,2,Sun Apr 12 12:50:39 2015 UTC,"In my experience, bushes will produce the same type of berry for the duration of the session unless they produce blueberries and you gather them.   The bushes around my base produced blueberries one day, so I put 'em in my rabbit pouch. Awhile later I was roaming around my base and the bushes were now producing twinberries."
TheForest,329ohj,Eslader,2,Tue Apr 14 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"Huh, good to know. I'd always seen them maintain their type during a session."
TheForest,329ohj,Eugenes_Axe,2,Tue Apr 14 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"I believe they randomly spawn on the bushes, just go exploring and keep your eyes peeled. They can also spawn on the same bush as poisonous berries if you've picked them and leave the area for a while."
TheForest,329ohj,majol,2,Sun Apr 12 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"Im not sure where exactly this would be because ive tried to ignore wikis and maps and i just explore to immerse myself, but along one of the coasts where the wrecked boat is with the modern axe theres always bushes with blueberries. If you come across the ship containers and fedex packages keep following that coast ""south"" i guess, keep the water to your right side and forest to the left, youll come across a huge tree on a cliff and a little past that theres the boat. Its in between that big non-cuttable cliff tree monument and that boat at the edge of the forest where theres a small fish pond and weak spear. Always tons of blueberries there ive restarted my game a few times and it always seems to be there so i always build the in that general area. Unlimited easy food and plenty of booze and logs"

Shots 3 - 5 show me lining up the shot: as it appears ingame, with a crosshair added, and then zoomed. It's worth noting that the target was moving from left to right so I am leading my shot, but I waited until he was a little closer to the centre before shooting. It's difficult to take a screenshot at the exact time I had the shot lined up.  Shots 6 + 7 show that I hit the target.  Edit:  Here's another album showing you can hit targets that are quite far away. Although this is at night I've zoomed in to try and show it as clearly as I can."

TheForest,326bmt,Kickinback32,3,Sat Apr 11 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"I've seen some people say that the bow and arrow is innaccurate, but in my experience, it is not. If you line up your shot as demonstrated, you should be fine.  Notes:  1) I believe the sway of your hands affects the trajectory of the arrow. Wait until your target is under the 'sights'.  2) Arrows fire in a perfect straight line with no parabolic arc at the moment.  3) Your 'crosshair' is vertically above the arrow, and horizontally across from the cloth.  4) The arrow has flight time, so you'll need to account for the distance of your target.  5) Arrows seem to ricochet off surfaces, if two or more enemies are lined up infront of you, you can get them all with one arrow.  6) Arrows stick into some surfaces and can be retrieved."
TheForest,326bmt,Phlogeston,5,Fri Apr 10 23:14:36 2015 UTC,It'd help if you did this in the daytime. I can't see shite about what you are aiming at.

I've got no fucking clue what's going on, but if you don't want to lose it, don't start paddling with it!  Edit 2: Immediately after using the weak spear, your equipped weapon won't disappear (in my experience), something's fucky here.

TheForest,31zr3f,mazdarati2,3,Thu Apr 9 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Most programmers have no knowledge of engineering. They want it to look like a plane I'm sure. But I doubt they grabbed photos and blueprints of one particular model to make as authentic a model of a plane as they could. In fact they probably didn't want to to perfectly match any one model of plane for fear of being sued since the portray this plane falling from the skies into a cannibal infested island. No airframe manufacturer is going to want that sort of publicity. This hold true for all games. Ever noticed games like GTA have ""Fake"" cars that look like real cars but no quite? Yet the Need for Speed franchise has a long history of using real cars. Well the difference is that you can't destroy the cars in most editions of Need for Speed. Yeah I'm sure the manufacturers gave some money for the advertising tie in, but they wouldn't have if the cars were getting wrecked."

The play-through before last it was my first night in my typical camping area and a group of five walked right through my camp with flashlights and everything.

This kinda goes against what the devs said in one of the Q and A's.  Link  Quote:  ""Q: And off of that, Will the mutant behavior scale off of what the player himself does? For example: A player who kills a lot of mutants, attracts a lot of attention, and breaks effigies, is more likely to get hunted down and attacked at their home more than a player who merely keeps to himself as best as possible.  A: Some of this is in currently, but not really tweaked, so it’s probably not noticeable enough. We want players who keep to themselves to not anger the cannibals as much as one who builds a lot of structures, kills a lot of cannibals and is generally a nuisance to them."""

You make it seem as though you wake up from the crash completely alone and then after some time you learn that there are cannibals on the island. What about the whole scene with the cannibal taking your son? Before the game even starts you know there are cannibals and presumably your son is also alive.

TheForest,31a1p1,Dr_Tower,3,Wed Apr 8 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"As u/FroggyBurn said it is good to look things up. You learn most just by playing along. I learned the hard way that the best way to survive the first night is to just build a treehouse and a fire. Of course, now with thirst being involved, it would be wise to build next to a pond or some other water source.  The beach is perfect once you start to settle in and it offers a lot of area for you to expand. My boyfriend, for the few times he's played, prefers to build in high hills for a better view but I prefer flat land because of the ease of building. I ended up finding my ideal spot (next to two cave openings, water, the ocean, mutant camp, etc.) and I swear I will never set up camp anywhere else.  The game is made in such a way that you can easily tailor it to your own playing style.  That all being said, the wiki offers very good insight to the mutants, tools, and other areas of gameplay. Just have fun with it and don't forget there are the other game modes: veganmode for no mutants and vegetarianmode for mutants only at night (perfect for beginners!)"

TheForest,30xcq6,TurboMan9,3,Wed Apr 1 03:27:35 2015 UTC,bummer that was a bug that just kind of ruined it for me. I spent hours building a fortress and they just walked in.

TheForest,30uy2u,grimism,2,Mon Mar 30 23:16:45 2015 UTC,I'm more than certain there's a time gap. I've died maybe 5 times in a 4hr coop session before without losing my shit. As long as it doesn't happen right after you should be good. Maybe it's once a day? Not sure really.
TheForest,30uy2u,BlueSmoke95,7,Tue Mar 31 01:16:21 2015 UTC,"The key here is coop.  In single-player, you die once and wake in a cave.  The second time, you are out for good.  Also, if a Shark kills you or you drown, you die for good.  In coop, there is currently no counter on deaths.  You can die as many times as you want.  I imagine it would cause issues if the host died and got booted from the server."

TheForest,30uer5,artsyalexis,2,Mon Mar 30 20:12:43 2015 UTC,How are you building stuff like the water collector above ground? Every time I try it just clips through the platform and wants to be placed on the ground.
TheForest,30uer5,Eslader,2,Wed Apr 1 16:16:33 2015 UTC,I think I was just able to glitch it in there. It flashed several times before locking in. I also noticed that backing up some and looking at where you want to place it helps.

Stand on the raft, go to each corner in turn, stand a foot or so in from the corner and look down/around, when you find the corner with the interaction icon, use it and you'll be in control of the raft. To move, left-click for thrust in the direction you are facing. But be aware! Only do this with a stick currently equipped, as of v0.15b I've been loosing whatever item is equipped when detaching myself from the raft (done by pressing 'E' again)."

If one player wants to take a rest, the other players could get a message and if all players press the rest button, they could skip the night.  Minecraft has this mechanic to."
TheForest,30ojis,Dragoneye85,3,Mon Mar 30 06:30:51 2015 UTC,No you can't. Sleep let's you skip hours but that would otherwise be unfair to your co-op mate. That could also cause serious issues in the long run so from a 'game engine' perspective: It will never be in MP.
TheForest,30ojis,mazdarati2,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"Minecraft has beds that let you skip the night. In multiplayer, you just lay there until everyone is in a bed and ready to proceed.   It could work the same way in The Forest easily. Using the shelter creates a prompt that gives all other players 5-10 seconds to also use a shelter."

TheForest,30ojis,WeAreChris,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"The luggage is not a 'bug' as such, it's just that many things in co-op are client-side only. That is to say each person sees their own version of things like:   Luggage What berries are on bushes Log sleds"

TheForest,30ojis,WeAreChris,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:14:06 2015 UTC,It's more an artifact of MP being hurridly thrown in due to the player-base's request. They initially did not intend to do MP until late or post-release. This compromise was a way for them to appease the fans rapidly in an engine that was not initially intended to support MP.   I hope (and believe) it will be improved upon significantly as development continues.
TheForest,30ojis,Eugenes_Axe,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:19:15 2015 UTC,Of course it is and I'm sure it'll improve

If you intend to kill them all, you must do it in one session.  Edit: I said this with certainty, but as with anything where we don't have an explicit comment from the dev, or the source code; there is an element of uncertainty that I should have expressed. See the below conversation"
TheForest,30gy0g,Eugenes_Axe,3,Fri Mar 27 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"I thought it was that you could kill a pre-loaded number before there are no more, restart a session, and more are added.  Like if there's 100, you can kill 20 that are preloaded.  after 20 no more come till you remake a game.  after that, its 80 left...but only 20 can be loaded this time like last.  Get what I mean?"

TheForest,30d6ob,Spanka,7,Thu Mar 26 12:33:13 2015 UTC,"Don't expect to be able to share things, because that's not a feature yet. You can build a snack, medicine or molotov holder to share the aforementioned, but it doesn't always work. Only the host can use molotovs, bombs or fire arrows - none of them work for the client; only the host gets thirsty or cold too (they recently introduced death from thirst or exposure so as the client you don't really get to experience that aspect), and only the host can see fish, sharks, or the wild pigs they just introduced too. Building things is faster with two people, obviously, but you're limited in what you can build; a lot of the cooler, useful things, like tree bridges, foundations, roofs, etc. are only available in single player at the moment. There are issues where things, like effigies, loot and berries on bushes, appear differently for each player too.  IMO co-op bugs seem to get fixed a loooooot slower, but that's to be expected I guess. Sometimes they can be game breaking (like getting stuck in the crouch or rope climbing animations indefinitely) and sometimes they're not. But then, you know, early access.  tl;dr a lot of stuff is broken and whoever is the client gets the shitty end of the deal, but despite this I've still played over 100 hours in co-op (as the client). Buy it and (hopefully) rejoice as things get better."

Fill a log sled with logs and keep putting logs in and out until you become 'attached'. Then climb the rope up to your sky village. You'll pick up and instantly drop a log in this process, but once you're up you can walk over to your blueprint and press 'interact' to fill the log requirements. I hope this makes sense, it's more art than science."

TheForest,30a7oq,Eslader,1 point,Thu Mar 26 06:49:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can build some stairs, then build a platform in front of them, then build another set of stairs on the platform.  Be warned though, stairs do not navigate very smoothly. I've had trouble placing then accurately enough so that I can just walk up unimpeded. Perhaps consider building a very low platform (i.e. just above or if possible at ground level) then using the tree bridge structure to create a smooth surface to walk upon."
TheForest,30a7oq,CryogenicMcdouble,2,Thu Mar 26 09:25:18 2015 UTC,"I'm working on one of those right now. Not home so I can't post pics, but I've built behind the big hill on the eastern side just north of the tents and small cannibal village. Nice view of the mountain that we might get to climb eventually.   I have a tall platform on the big hill for observation. That has a bridge down to a log cabin on the ground which I built first. The cabin is surrounded by defensive walls. The only way in or out is to rope climb up to platforms. Inside the fence I have a fire and a drying rack for food storage.   Then I built a network of tree platforms and bridges all the way down to the big lake with the boat in it so that I can run over and get the ropes out without having to run through the woods and possibly have cannibals get between me and my base. The final platform is in the water next to the cliff - I've never seen a cannibal intentionally jump in there, so it's pretty safe to jump off the platform, grab my ropes, and then climb back up without having to worry too much about getting attacked.   Like you I've never been hurt while up in the sky base. They're definitely pissed that I'm there and have spread over so much acreage, so sometimes I'll have 5-10 of them down there howling at me and charging toward me, but it seems that cannibals cannot jump into trees that have construction on them so I can just sit up there and taunt them. Occasionally I'll shoot flaming arrows at them just to be sadistic, and then watch more cannibals come and eat my victims.   The sky base took so many logs to build that I've clearcut a lot of forest around it, which means I can see for a very long distance in all directions, especially on the hill platform.  The only time I ever need to come down is when I run low on food, and that's not very dangerous because there are lots of rabbits and lizards roaming over the big hill, so I just go out to the observation platform and make sure no one's anywhere near, and then go down and empty traps and chase things around with a spear for awhile.   The next time an upgrade breaks saves, I'm planning on spanning the island with a bridge, with a platform outside of at least one cave, and above the large village if I can get it built without getting killed."

When they run, they will sometimes double back and attempt to gore you (does minimal damage but rips through armor). Hitting them once seems to cause them stop running. Sometimes the will attack you for seemingly no reason. They are absolutely everywhere in the eastern part of the middle of the island. They hang out in the forest.

Not knowing what to do and learning your environment is one of the great things about this game. Most sounds I hear in game I pretty much attribute to something, usually cannibals. So when the new animal sounds came out. I was freaked out by everything.  I don't think anyone knows what the scream means but they do it a lot and it might be to just signs of the player. I do know that they will mark your things with effigies. They marked my log sled which was a good was away from my fort with an effigy and they do it all along the tree line where I pretty much deforested the area."

However I'd advise strongly against playing like that, as it'll be fun for the first couple of days... then you'll kill the survival aspect. I suggest shooting the arrows like the OP originally said.

Torches can be your most perfect line of defense, I put them under and around all of my hides because the dumdums run into them while they're spazzing out in my base. I find that the more bases you can have the better off you are, I will make lots of small bases that have traps and drying racks and are near good loot spots."
TheForest,2zq798,BugsButty,2,Fri Mar 20 23:34:28 2015 UTC,"I have multiple bases built around the island with multiple styles.  When I first started the game back in v. 0.11 you could carry logs while swimming.  So I built a raft and would carry them to them to the unfinished island.  I build a log cabin and all the necessary stuff.  Now I mostly build walled forts in areas that usually have a lot of supplies.  I just built a bridge to one of the small islands in the river but I haven't used it much since there's no resources on it.  The most recent base that I made, I walled off the huge tree that they worship on the pennisula.  Here's an album of some of my FORTS. Sadly, these are the only ones that I have pictures of."

I stick some torches around the base, effigies dotted around the clearing (Which I cleared...) and add some defence spikes and noose traps, just to be sure. The most recent update added climbing walls, one of which spawned right where I build, so that saves me having to try and make myself a rope to get up and down a cliff."

TheForest,2zpvip,Eslader,3,Fri Mar 20 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"I've never tried being a pacifist, so I'm not too sure, but I have had times where I would meet groups of 4 or 5 cannibals, and they wouldn't do anything against me unless I attacked.  I think the more removed from their territory you are and the less aggressive you act, the more they'll leave you alone.  Being armored up seems to help too."
TheForest,2zpvip,TeachMeShrimp,3,Fri Mar 20 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure, but I would say off-hand that something is wrong with your save.  I say this only because the pacifist route never works for me. In the beginning the scouts are happy enough to just look at me and then leave, if I don't act aggressive towards them. But they keep coming back, more and more frequently and then they just attack. I notice that it usually seems to be one of the women who initiates it and then after that they become relentless. Even if I'm non-aggressive they try to attack all the time.  When the game was new I started a game and had a grand time, building things and not being attacked. Never saw anyone. Finally commented on the strange lack of natives and was told that I needed to start a new game. You might be having a similar problem, maybe?  The last time I played I had the exact opposite 'problem' you're having. I couldn't build anything. I set up a little temp shelter and immediately a huge swarm of cannibals appeared and attacked me immediately. I was lucky that my back was against some rocks, so I was able to defend myself. I killed an absurd number of them before finally being overwhelmed. I had to have killed 15-20 or them. There were body parts everywhere. The game was unplayable, because I would say it only took about 10 minutes for them to find me and their numbers were limitless, without any break. I would kill a few and then immediately another few would be running towards me until I was finally dead."

This should show you what I've got in addition to showing you where I am on the island, should you go looking for it. (Image descriptions should be helpful.)   The shot in the original post is probably north-by-northwest of my camp, further north than the fishpond in the album. Follow the beach to the shipping containers.  Not included in the album, there is a sizable mutant camp southwest of my home, where you can find chicory and coneflower. When I'm in the area I usually see some activity, but that's also where my plane crashed, so it could be because of either.  Going due west from my treehouse (behind it and deeper into the woods) you can find aloe and marigold, as well as camps both human and native.  Following the shore in the southerly direction will take you to a space where lizards, rabbits, and tortoises spawn. That's my main hunting ground."

For instance, when I go into a new server I will have all of my old gear, and he will have none.    The host will start again, but client's inventories are carried from server to server. You didn't mention who was hosting so I can't help further.   We cant see each others meat on the meat racks (or in the snack cabinet, the rabbits in their cages, ect.)...   Yup, these are all client-side (as in, only on your local computer) at the moment.   I can't see fish in ponds.   Known issue for clients in multi-player, I'm assuming you were not the host.   Also, rafts and mating the rabbits doesn't work.   Not sure what you mean about rafts, but they are tricky and unintuitive to operate. Mating rabbits doesn't seem to work in SP or MP at the moment.   Caves are pretty impossible and super glitchy to go through on mp.   I've not really tried caving in MP much, can't comment on this. The caves seem to be handled as a separate 'level' that loads in when you enter a cave. You may have noticed a short performance drop when entering/exiting a cave. This is probably just down to 'alpha is alpha' and optimisation will come in due time.   And does anyone know if they're going to fix it soon in a patch?    Nope, the devs haven't mentioned when these things will be fixed, but I trust them to get round to them at some point."
TheForest,2zjiwr,Eugenes_Axe,1 point,Thu Mar 19 10:42:13 2015 UTC,"My brother and I tried the MP yesterday for the first time (I was host)  We had several things not working correctly   My brother (client) never had to drink. His thirstindicator was always full. My brother (client) never got cold at night, but I (host) did. After a few minutes of playing we didn't find any more stones for building. At the beginning we found about 10 of them. My brother (client) didn't see the pigs (I could see them), but they attacked him and he got damage."

TheForest,2zic5p,KeenzGamingYT,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"Saving currently works as follows:   The host can save their location and inventory / status; the same as Single Player. Clients can save their inventory / status, but will load in at the plane crash each time they enter the server.   By 'status', I mean health, food, water, armour, etc. Some bugs related to saving:   Water pouch and old pot will be emptied on loading a save. The re-breather will also be emptied of any oxygen on loading a save."

TheForest,2zeixh,kjetils,2,Wed Mar 18 13:21:08 2015 UTC,Sap and booze also gives your weapon a fire effect. Not sure if it's timed or it's just like molotovs where a single hit implies death because of the stunlocking burn damage.

Overall though I think the most important thing to have when building a base is to have clear lines of sight. In the current version the main threat are Armsies, as they'll smash down your walls & go berserk when lit on fire; not good when they're right next to your base. However, if spotted from a good distance away you can light them on fire with fire arrows, giving you enough time to wear them down before they get close."

TheForest,2ycpny,SkiBacon,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:41:12 2015 UTC,In coop it seems to just piss them off and they come in relentless patrols. We found an entrance to a cave and started fortifying around it. We set up effigies and they didn't give a fuck. One patrol after another. We probably killed 80 or so cannibals then just kept getting killed.
TheForest,2ycpny,itsdietz,6,Mon Mar 9 08:15:30 2015 UTC,"At least in coop, I haven't really noticed the effigies doing much... Honestly, they are just cool and help the role-playing experience.  If they scare the cannibals away, it's very temporary :)"
TheForest,2ycpny,Al-Shabaab,3,Sun Mar 8 23:44:15 2015 UTC,In coop they are absolutely useless. But in the single player I have a large effigy right outside my fort and I kit it every night and hardly ever see cannibals. I left it and started a new base testing our a treehouse near the yacht area. Apparently its patrolled like crazy.   After a couple nights there I ran back to my old fort and there was a leggy thing patrolling outside my fort and patrols all through the woods just up the hill. I imagine this is because I quit lighting my large effigy. Once I killed leggy and moved back in I didn't have any trouble when lighting my effigy. Though I saw an increase in patrols nearby but not immediately close.   I attribute that to my effigy but it could be just luck.
TheForest,2ycpny,itsdietz,3,Mon Mar 9 08:13:10 2015 UTC,I have over a hundred heads on sticks and an additional 6 or so large effigies and I've seen lone Pales (not Starvers) walk into the field of heads and stand looking contemplative. Kinda weird.

Everyone involved needs to try hosting (new game), and everyone needs to try joining random public servers to see if they get kicked.  My friend and I had issues with getting coop to work - ""inviting"" doesn't work for us at all, for example. The only way it works for us is to host a public game and then the person joining needs to find the game in the server browser.  Hopefully you can get it working! Coop is lots of fun."

I know there is logic to take the file with the most recent timestamp. In your case it sounds like your renamed file isn't valid for multiplayer (perhaps because of tree bridges or something along those lines).
TheForest,2xy9jn,256bitsofentropy,3,Thu Mar 5 18:05:10 2015 UTC,Oh wow I only though they were stores in the locallow/sks/ file location.   Whereabouts are the other two? I'll disable steam cloud as well

I did have one session where it seemed I'd killed all the mutants--I kept my game running for days, just paused/minimized when I wasn't playing, so the number of natives didn't reset. When I finally found more mutants, I saw three one-man patrols, seeming to originate or centered around a nearby cave. Whether or not caves represent a place of origin I can't say.

TheForest,2xkhtv,itsdietz,2,Sun Mar 1 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"I went to the custom foundations menu and laid one end down on one end of the river and swam to the other side. Once there, I placed a 90 degree log just outside the minimum radius.  With the new update (maybe in previous versions too) they made custom floors automatically add on once you do the previous step.  This allows for the bridge to be completed with only one support truss.  Note: this breaks science. I made sure to find the shortest distance between the two islands and then proceeded to gather logs.  And done.  A fast way to create a quick and safe escape from the natives.  Not shown in this picture, because I am still working on it, is the other bridge connecting this island to the not finished area. From the concept bridge that I made, it will take about 120 logs to complete.  So I might just scrap the project idk."

TheForest,2xi0an,kezza596,4,Sat Feb 28 21:50:38 2015 UTC,Been in the game for quite a while; nothing official but it's an idea that Spider Mutants birth the mutants and those are babies.  They WILL fling at you and deal damage.  You can kill them.
TheForest,2xi0an,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,3,Sat Feb 28 21:56:46 2015 UTC,Oh so it's an actual thing for them to go soaring towards you? I chopped one up which then alerted the mutants. I couldn't understand if it was a glitch or actual thing. I'm not sure which one is more disturbing!
TheForest,2xi0an,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,3,Sat Feb 28 22:00:04 2015 UTC,"The game isn't fleshed out lore/story wise, so right now everything is just somethignw eird creepy and unknown.  Whya re there female and male mutants?  Why don't male mutants have penises, but females have breasts?  Why do they have breasts if the Spider Mutants are shitting them out en masse like an ant queen in a nest?  How do feral mutants become feral?  The idea is that they are starving apparently but why and how?  How are their remains of previous civilized humans all over and camps and shit, and a boat, but they couldn't have missed all the camps and effigies?"

TheForest,2xgi0m,Twistntie,7,Sat Feb 28 13:11:01 2015 UTC,"i usually search for a spot with as many ressources as possible, as close to the plane as possible.  what i build in the first 1-2 days depends on where my plane crashed. in other words it depends on how many mutants i expect in the area. if i find a quiet place i usually build a temporary shelter, a small fire  and a bench in a hidden place but outside of my future fortress. and then i take all the time i need to make an awesome camp while i avoid direct mutant contacts.  if i expect lots of mutants i search for an easy to guard spot.  something with natural border where iam able to make a small fortress with 10-20 logs. inside a bench and a fire. what kind of shelter depends on the location, but i dont build that on the first day.  btw with this new patch i found out that building on water is a terrible idea. you dont have to be close to the water but still have that drink option everywhere. a single fail click and you lose another 10% life.  http://imgur.com/gTtB9dy http://imgur.com/k7wXQuc  its 100% mutant save, they cant use the bridge as far as i can tell. but you cant do shit on that plattform because you always drink water if you try to interact with something.  worst way to build a base :<"
TheForest,2xgi0m,Darirol,2,Sat Feb 28 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty awesome idea for a base! I love being above the ground, over a cliff or something!  Why do you settle close to the plane? Doesn't that draw them in? I tend to build close-ish to the plane as well with my friend, usually because then we can actually fight stuff haha.  Also, why the bench?"
TheForest,2xgi0m,Darirol,2,Sat Feb 28 16:04:03 2015 UTC,a bench regenerates all your energy within a few seconds if you sit on it.  costs 2 logs and enables you to chop twice as much trees  and sprint around all the time without using your energy drinks.  next to the plane mostly because iam a bad explorer.  i usually end up running in circles. the plane offers a unique landmark.  also the plane offers lots of respawning food and medics.  and of course i dont want to walk like an hour real life time to find a good spot. at the end you can basicly build everywhere

TheForest,2xgi0m,death_dealer88,3,Sun Mar 1 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"I tend to build in the middle of the map/forest. first I do a perimeter check to make sure there are no enemy bases within long range. I also usually build up against a wall. If it's dark and moody just build a fire ! Caves are a bad idea because you will have constant contact with the enemies,unless you like the action. I like to play stealth,lay low,crouch and hide in the thick grass from enemies and start a fight only when i need to.If you happen to kill an enemy outside of your house/fort try to pick up its body and take it far away from your house because it will only attract more cannibals to come and feed off its corpse."
TheForest,2xgi0m,death_dealer88,2,Sat Feb 28 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"That play style has always seemed very fun, especially with the camouflage changes and stuff! How far do they usually see your campfire?"
TheForest,2xgi0m,Seniornosleep,2,Sat Feb 28 16:21:11 2015 UTC,I think thats the way this game should be played in my opinion.

TheForest,2xgi0m,Drilok_4,3,Sat Feb 28 17:01:03 2015 UTC,I look for a place away from the plane (to avoid the savages) but near a small pond (for fish) that is mostly clear and open (to make fighting the natives easier) but also it close enough to drag in logs with a sled. I make sure the place is near a luggage spawn point for easy access to booze bottles too.  usually on a new game I build small hunting shelters as I explore and take my time finding the perfect spot with all these things
TheForest,2xgi0m,Drilok_4,2,Sat Feb 28 20:58:02 2015 UTC,I normally build at the edge of the forest that is closest to the beach. I like to be able to see them coming from a ways off. By starting with a tree house and clearing the surrounding trees it makes it so I have a safe place to go if there are too many. Generally I build circular walls around my camp increasing in size each time.
TheForest,2xgi0m,SgtLumpyOnRust,3,Sat Feb 28 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"I like that plan if I want to make a fort. Saves me from getting dropped on by the cannibals. When you say you build walls in a circle increasing in size, do you destroy the previous walls?"
TheForest,2xgi0m,Evansyperson,2,Sat Feb 28 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"No, I leave all the walls up because they can sometimes jump over them or just glitch through so the layers of walls makes it a bit safer. The only bad thing is that once they are in, they cant get out so you have to go kill them but at least its just one on one"
TheForest,2xgi0m,davidg75,2,Sat Feb 28 18:58:29 2015 UTC,That makes perfect sense! Like an airlock sort of. Do you find they can get through circular walls harder than square?

I start by putting a doorway surrounded by standing fires onto one of the huts, build a temp hut inside and go from there. My current base encircles a cannibal village consisting of 7 huts. The cannibals can get up  the side of huts so i put defensive walls on the outside edge of the back of the hut. plus you can spear them from behind  the bars on the inside of the hut although they can stil glitch through sometimes liek they do with any object.  - foot note- also i realized since the cannibals can go up the side of huts, so can we, so i buitl a gazebo overlookign a lake jsut outside my village and you get to it by scaling up the side of a hut inside my perimeter, then at teh top of the hut its alinged with the open porch of the gazebo so you can walk in from there."

TheForest,2x5to8,Pamperpull,3,Thu Feb 26 11:19:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry for asking this question here but I don't want to make a new post.  I purchased this game the first weekend it came out on Steam, and played it for a few days and haven't played it since.  Is there any sort of timeframe for when The Forest is going to be completed and released? I'm keen to play it when it's finished as I enjoyed the experience of the game when it first came out. Thanks"
TheForest,2x5to8,chaotic2050,3,Thu Feb 26 10:03:20 2015 UTC,"Not that I've heard.   But they are plodding along quite quickly with development at the moment. Patches are about 3-4 weeks apart (although this last patch was only 2 weeks after the prior one), and the last few have contained quite a lot of new mechanics. So I'd be very surprised if this was still in development in a couple of years time (like DayZ). I secretly hope it's either at, or near completion by the end of this year."
TheForest,2x5to8,Eugenes_Axe,2,Thu Feb 26 10:28:54 2015 UTC,Thanks. That is good to hear.

A workaround I've also noticed is that when you upgrade that weapon with just one feather/tooth, you will get the full effects back from all the other times you have upgraded it."

TheForest,2x9mt1,itsdietz,4,Thu Feb 26 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"I think mining (and thus, eventually metal working) would be cool. I do think it's a bit out of the scope of the game though - imagine what implementing a mining system would take...  Plus, it might not really be in the spirit of the game to create stone structures, metal tools, etc.  I definitely think there are lots of places where the gathering/crafting system could improve and expand though. Knapping would be cool - stone knives, stone tipped spear, stone tipped arrows...  I'm excited where this game is going - I'm sure stuff like that will be added in the future :)"

TheForest,2wrl6n,JackMancactus,4,Sun Feb 22 15:36:38 2015 UTC,Happened to my buddy one time it was a side effect of skipping the intro relaunched the game watched the intro and all was fine. But I suspect your issue may be different. I'm not sure if the forest hides configuration or other files in your user folder for saves but it may have something g corrupted in there that wouldn't get removed when you deleted the game.
TheForest,2wrl6n,Darkness223,3,Sun Feb 22 15:47:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't even have the option to look at the intro. I'll look and see if I can find any other files.   Actually one thing I don't think I've done is restart after deleting the game so I'm going to try that now and see.
TheForest,2wrl6n,Darkness223,2,Sun Feb 22 16:07:04 2015 UTC,Ok so I tried the restarting and no dice. I couldn't find any other files on my PC. The only other thing I can think of is that I had the game set to the Steam cloud sync... so maybe that save file is corrupted and screwing everything up?? If it even works like that.
TheForest,2wrl6n,Darkness223,3,Mon Feb 23 13:27:31 2015 UTC,Something is definitely messed up maybe try reaching out to the devs?

And now that I'm thinking about, I'm pretty sure I skipped the intro on that first game I loaded that was half-working, like what happened to your buddy. So maybe that save file keeps getting synced to my PC because of the cloud sync and is causing issues. I'll try to delete that tonight, then turn off cloud sync, reinstall, and see what happens.

TheForest,2w9pzm,SurvivalistGaming,17,Wed Feb 18 02:55:32 2015 UTC,"A suggestion on how to improve paint:  Rename the current paint to dye and retain the same crafting recipes. Since water is being added to the game, I think you could mix some dye and water together to make paint for larger things like walls. This could possibly be achieved by allowing the player to build a special basin to put dye into water stored in the basin to create paint. Then the paint could be put on a paint brush (made by combining a stick and animal fur) and applied to buildings or other things.  Consider adding more tree sap required to make dye to make it thicker so when its added to the water it isn't too watery. Also the ability to use a paint brush on a corpse to get blood to paint with, or alternatively be able to craft red dye with a limb (arm or leg) and some tree sap."

The issue I'm finding is that there isn't much to do other than build a base which gets a little repedative after the 3rd or so play through. Someone needs to come up with an idea to keep it interesting beyond base building.
TheForest,2w9pzm,Xeteth,0,Wed Feb 18 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"maybe they should implement, that cannibals gonna siege your base. And if you just hide in your base there could be something like cannibals with projectiles or even catapults (that would be hilarious). so you are kinda forced to fight or to run from your base away"
TheForest,2w9pzm,RaffoRaffati,-7,Thu Feb 19 12:06:22 2015 UTC,"Outside of new progression/story content, which takes a lot of dev resources, I think some very very lightweight PvP support (as in, allow nameplates to be disabled, make the host/server remember more information about its clients--save location, etc.) would be great for replayability.  And I think PvP should be in addition to the current game mode, rather than have its own mode. Having highly dangerous NPCs running around encourages building a defensible base, which would otherwise probably be ignored in a purely PvP mode. This also introduces interesting dynamics like sabotaging bases, stealing resources (which actually matters in this game), and luring mutants.  edit: apparently (optionally) disabling nameplates will instantly turn the community into assholes. I bow before superior judgement"

TheForest,2w9pzm,GROMkill,0,Wed Feb 18 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"Actually I think rabidly shooting down gameplay options is far more indicative of a 'shitty, jaded community' than having gameplay options. Holy fuck."
TheForest,2w9pzm,chimpan_z,5,Wed Feb 18 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"Why does every survival game have to be PvP? Rust is slightly understandable, so is DayZ and other zombie ones, but this isn't the type for PvP. Everyone comes from the same plane and being the few that survived would be more of an incentive to survive and work together, not apart."

TheForest,2w9pzm,chimpan_z,2,Wed Feb 18 23:43:09 2015 UTC,"If anything, the game seems to harp on realism, so disabling nameplates would make sense. If your partner is on the other side of the island, you shouldn't know where he is."

I built my base on the other side of the river, just a few yards away from the ""not yet complete"" boarder. Nothing ever patrols or spawns over there, so I'm at like day 25+ with having only ran into 1 patrol group that didn't actually see me, and a handful of the feral guys.   I actually built the bridge hoping that I could later antagonize them enough to come attack my fortress. They haven't seemed interested in crossing it though."

However, so far I've never seen anyone at that village the entire time I've played. Not even the feral guys run around there. The closest I've come to seeing someone there was this one guy who was just standing at the bottom of the river. Just totally underwater, standing there.   Maybe if I got them pissed off enough the night patrols would go over there, but so far I haven't seen anyone."

TheForest,2w6rw9,SurvivalistGaming,9,Tue Feb 17 12:53:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe this just hasn't been implemented yet, but it would be nice to see a more stark progression of encounters with the natives as well as a bigger difference between the different ""kinds"" of natives. (This is me just expounding upon what's already in the game...)  1) The first day you should only run into one native--a scout or something. And they should almost never attack. They stay at a distance, checking you out, but not engaging. If you act aggressively, they run off for reinforcements. If you act passively, then they stay in ""observation mode"" a bit longer.  2) It's during this time that you should see natives fighting each other. Maybe a small patrol corners, kills, and eats (or whatever) another native, like the ""starving native."" (Or vice versa: a pack of starving natives kill a normal native.) This should happen a good distance away, but hopefully the noise and commotion will attract your attention. It'll show that these natives mean business.  3) Starving natives should be the ""wild card."" Almost always wandering around and almost always alone. These are the outcasts of the island, for whatever reason, and even though they're weaker, they're much more aggressive. I think this might be the case already, but it's difficult to tell. The difference should be more obvious to players.  4) Next some patrols should start to show up, but just 3-4 natives at a time. Nothing big. They do more observations, but start to act a little more aggressive. They already do these ""bluff attacks"" where they run at you and then stop short in front of you. Lots of that. Maybe an attack, but if you fight back or kill one of them, they retreat.  And then maybe they don't show up for a while. Like a day or something.  5) But then they show up with more. Like 5-6 in a patrol. This time they're ready to take action against you. They show up, size you up, and then start attacking. Up until this point, the natives don't do much at night unless they're in patrol groups. For whatever reason, they know not to come out at night unless they have safety in numbers (and light).  6) Meanwhile, if you're ever knocked out and manage to escape from the caves, or venture down into a cave willingly, take something, and leave, then that should piss off the mutants. The mutants come out at night. They're more afraid of fire than the natives. They're already stronger than the natives, which is awesome. Fighting them should be super serious. We're starting to get towards some end game shit here, ya know?  7) And if you manage to kill a few mutants, then that's when the behemoths start to come out. I've never experienced this in the game (although I've only been playing for a month), but I've never experienced anything close to what is depicted in the 3rd trailer. I WANT THAT! I want a full out war. I want to piss off the mutants so much that they gather an army, attack my fortress, and it's up to me to craft bombs, molotovs, arrows, traps, and powerful weapons to fight them off.  Right now, I feel like I'm having the same encounter with natives/mutants over and over again. It was scary at first, but not it's kinda annoying. I think a progression like this would make it a little easier at the beginning but much harder at the end. It would also provide a steadily increasing sense of danger. So, like I said at the very beginning, maybe this progression is planned but just not implemented. But this is what I would love to have in the game. :-)  By the way, I'm enjoying the hell out of this game!"
TheForest,2w6rw9,YtseDude,3,Tue Feb 17 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"I've had a few ideas like this but not as in depth. I agree that the experience is scary at first but then gets repetitive to the point where it's just an inconvenience.   Something I've thought about that would be a sweet mechanic. What if the game allowed you to find a lone starving outcast mutant and feed them, gain their trust and then do cool shit. Like maybe they help you in game some how, by scouting for you, gathering supplies, fighting with you or even something not implemented in the game yet, like if we end up with a map that you need to fill in as you progress, they could help with that, or mark places on your existing map, or even just have them give you items you can't get otherwise"
TheForest,2w6rw9,ElectricAlan,2,Thu Feb 19 03:28:25 2015 UTC,"Hah, not a bad idea! I'd say you feed them some, yeah, but also you have to beat them every once in a while to show your dominance."
TheForest,2w6rw9,malchusbrydger,3,Thu Feb 19 15:48:10 2015 UTC,yeah that is part of the main problem with the forest. there is no feeling for progress.  what you describe here is pretty much perfect in my opinion for mutant behaviour
TheForest,2w6rw9,Darirol,5,Thu Feb 19 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"It would be nice to have some of  the trees grow back, a lot of land near my base is deforested and barren. Also when you touch a fire accidentally dose it have to burn away your entire set of armor?"
TheForest,2w6rw9,TED2000,3,Tue Feb 17 23:08:30 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see the natives move around and build as well. The tribe grows, they build more huts. You kill them off, huts go abandoned and start falling apart, perhaps another tribe moves in?  Also tribes in conflict with each other.  Another cool thing would be terrain manipulation, give us a shovel to dig and a hoe to make bigger gardens, but then I guess it might look too much like other survival games."
TheForest,2w6rw9,TortugaDelFuego7,2,Wed Feb 18 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"I also love the idea of seeing the effect you have on the natives. They already build and tailor their effigies to you and your presence, so I think the hut idea is fantastic too. maybe even hunting/raiding parties setting up more temporary shelters near your base?   Piggy-backing off of that, I think it would be cool to have the ability to destroy/burn down the natives' huts. If them building huts was a mechanic, this could be a really fun feature, where destroying their camps maybe disrupted their long-term operations, but enraged them in the short-term to mindlessly throw attacks at you. I would be cool to work your way along the island ""claiming"" more territory as your own."
TheForest,2w6rw9,abigassbrick,3,Wed Feb 18 18:39:17 2015 UTC,I vote for proximity on the walkie talkies. I would love to hear static/scrambled speech if other players get too far away or down in the caves.
TheForest,2w6rw9,Darirol,2,Wed Feb 18 07:23:06 2015 UTC,"the main problem with the forest atm is that almost no game/char progress comes from building a base that is larger then a shelter+5 walls. shelter for saving/sleeping and the walls to get a few moments between mutant fights to heal yourself/get energy. everything beyond that adds nothing gameplay wise but is a pretty huge pain in the ass, because choping wood get boring very quickly. i understand that wood is the only reasonable resource to build stuff as a surviver and the amount needed is probably necessary to provide long term goals. but it is boring as hell and once you are done there is not much forest left.  the same goes for exploring. once you got your fishing spear there is hardly anything in this game that provides new gameplay options. at least the grafics look pretty awesome so running around could at least be considered fun.  what i think the game needs, is some kind of progression.   exploring/finding stuff should provide your char with new gameplay options or char development:   items required for crafting usefull things items that enable you to do things you couldnt do very efficient without items required to advance in basebuilding (maybe put ""blueprints"" of what you can build aside from a basic shelter/campfire as find able items in random locations on the surface/in the caves. or improve existing blueprints by reducing their building costs because you ""found a better way to build things"") what ever you get from exploring it should be nothing that requires you to do an activity like moving logs from the forest to your base, because thats pretty annoying.   base building should provide more then sleeping and taking a break from mutant killing   atm even with a huge base and lots of traps and stuff i end up going out of my base and kill every mutant in front of my base with my axe. why did i even build this base? could have killed those guys as well without a base. the base should provide a way to get rid of nearby mutants in a different way. give me wall mounted weapons or a catapult in the middle of my base or stuff like that. to make it not that easy, let the mutants do a coordinated ambush if your base grows too big the base should be able to help you out with the ""grinding"". its nice to have containers to drop rocks and sticks ad logs, but that provides almost no help. (except if you need logs or rocks or sticks as ammo for your wall mounted weapons) isnt it possible that your base provides you with some ressources or with a way to collect ressources faster? like the log sledge. maybe an advanced base could provide you with things that makes exploring more easy. what if you could make your armor only in a building in your base, what if you could build better equipment after expanding your base, maybe you need to find the blueprints for those better equipments and then build something in your base to be able to make better equipment. if you need to build more things, there is a need to make a larger base. and if mutants destroy non-wall things very easy, you need to protect your stuff with a well defended base if mutants are going to be able to destroy parts of your base, how about upgrading your walls. you could add clay? add this new building ressource to make your walls fire proof. would work pretty well with your plans of painting buildings.add clay to the wall and all you need to do is to chance the color. (clay color could be changed by mixing things in it like leaves to make it green, mutant blood for red clay and once you come up with an idea what makes things blue, you could allow to mix any color edit:highlevel mutants in the caves could have blue blood/skin/whatever)   all together: wood choping is boring as hell andexpanding your base adds nothing gameplaywise, exploration adds nothing meaningfull atm and once you killed all mutants next to your base, you kind of have won the game(until you reload)"

TheForest,2w6rw9,doctadrey,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:15:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a combat mechanic rework, currently the combat can be pretty engaging and interactive, I really like the block mechanic even though it's hard to use effectively. The mutant attack patterns are also pretty good, I have found when they attack in groups they do things like charge you one at a time, stopping short before they get to you, except the last attacker follows through, so you have to keep moving and strike at the right opportunities. One problem with this is that molotovs are too hard to use, and flaming axes make it too easy. If this was reworked to only set someone alight on hit, instead of just proximity, it would make combat harder to breeze through and be more interactive as a result. On the flip side, molotovs are one of the easiest ways to kill natives if you can hit, but they're easy to miss and do nothing with. I think there should be a much larger AoE for a molotov, this makes it easy to clean up large groups, but it also enables the game to get away with throwing more mutants at you when needed, as you can deal with it easier, plus it makes molotovs more valuable, if not necessary.  Another possibility is adding the fire trigger to a successful blocking action, this means you can be offensive and defensive at the same time, as well it fits the flavour of combat nicely"

If you want to have a harder time surviving I'd suggest playing alone. It's kind of creepy when those fuckers sneak up on you while you're cutting down a tree or something and you turn around to 5 dudes just standing there looking at you.
TheForest,2w56wk,poodles_and_oodles,3,Tue Feb 17 03:57:44 2015 UTC,"ya, really, the fun of the game for me is letting myself get immersed, trying to actually let myself get scared. the other night I screamed louder than I ever have before when I turned around a tree and there was one behind it"
TheForest,2w56wk,handsoftime,2,Tue Feb 17 06:07:37 2015 UTC,"I was playing today and got scared. I was exploring a cave (mind you this is the first time I've played this game), and you'd think that all the creepy effigies outside this entrance would tell me to turn around, but I pressed on anyway. Having just my lighter and the handaxe from the plane, I slowly made my way deeper. I turned to my right at one point and one of those fuckers were right there! Safe to say my first playthrough I only survived one night haha. I love this game."
TheForest,2w4769,Eugenes_Axe,10,Mon Feb 16 21:02:28 2015 UTC,At least a yell action. If I was really in there axing mutants I'd be screaming bloody murder for the sheer fun of it let alone the intimidation factor
TheForest,2w4769,Democrab,5,Tue Feb 17 00:37:08 2015 UTC,Exactly! Chivalry Medivial Warfare has a battle cry and it's so much fun to roar into battle.

TheForest,2w4769,Okuu-Trollzy,2,Thu Feb 26 19:45:05 2015 UTC,Whoops. Missed that. My bad. Nice kill though. I just killed my first Spidey and Armsy recently.
TheForest,2w4769,itsdietz,2,Thu Feb 26 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"No worries. Good work! I had an advantage, being >15m in the air helps protect you somewhat! Recently saw my first surface-dwelling spider mutant the other night actually. Managed to immolate itself on my standing fires, silly bugger."
TheForest,2w4769,itsdietz,2,Thu Feb 26 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"lol That's awesome. I had the armsy guy show up randomly while building a second base on the other side of the island. I kited him and eventually killed him with two molotovs. Later on, I slept in my new tree house, climbed down and heard the screams of nearby cannibals. I ran off and took cover near some rocks and watched them explore my new camp and right behind them a mister armsy strolled out and I noped the fuck out of there. I snuck back to my fortress on the other side of the island and theres mister legsy patrolling the entrance. I molotoved him 3 times, led him through a trap, axed him and shot a fuck ton of arrows into him until a lucky arrow brought him down."

It provides you with a great perspective on cooperative survival, and you can have a lot of laughs over it. You can also now trade things with each other on the racks and storage. The building isn't really buggy at all. Now with that being said, coop is pretty laggy. It eventually becomes unbearable. That is as of now I think the biggest problem with coop.  Other than thatit's great :)"

TheForest,2w60w4,poodles_and_oodles,3,Tue Feb 17 06:09:36 2015 UTC,At this point it's probably because 'alpha is alpha' and will hopefully be addressed as the game develops.

The sound levels being off (I agree btw) is more 'polish' than 'feature' or bug."
TheForest,2w60w4,PlNG,2,Tue Feb 17 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the game seems to be ignoring my music preferences as I still hear some music playing from time to time.  Does the brightness slider even do anything? It doesn't seem to be connected or it's not making a noticeable difference."
TheForest,2w2f9o,TheDragonCourier,2,Mon Feb 16 11:18:39 2015 UTC,This and the fact that sleds are now log teleporters that can reliably be turned on and off.
TheForest,2w2f9o,Hotrian,1 point,Mon Feb 16 12:02:53 2015 UTC,what do you mean log teleporters?
TheForest,2w2f9o,Hotrian,1 point,Mon Feb 16 12:07:53 2015 UTC,"Regardless of distance you can still use E to grab logs and C to place logs into any sled you're linked with. You can become linked to any sled with at least one log in it by just pushing it some distance (not very far required). You become unlinked by dropping a log into a sled at melee range and while looking directly at it.   Does this not happen in your game ? This happens consistently in my multiplayer game. It fails every so often (1 in 50?), and sometimes results in a sled you can't drop into until reconnecting (1 in 200?).  It can be used to fill sleds without running back and forth, or filling two sleds at once, or with multiple people- teleporting logs back to the sled and offloading them directly into storage. It isn't useful to become linked to more than one sled though since when you hit E to pick up a log you'll pull out of both sleds first, so you can't fill more than 8 logs (1 full cart + 1 log). I have linked to ten sleds at once though :0.   If this doesn't happen in your game I'm backing up everything immediately :D"
TheForest,2w2f9o,Democrab,1 point,Mon Feb 16 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"It happens in mine, can confirm.   There's also another one where if you hold crouch after sprinting with the right timing, you can get free sprinting. Been consistently doing it in my current save on mp"
TheForest,2w2f9o,mrhello3846,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"I still kind of miss rocket sleds.  If you ran the sled over rocks, and tree stumps eventually the sled would fly straight up in the air.  The latest update seems to have fixed that unfortunately.  I think you can still do that by swinging heads you chop off a corpse though, so it's not too late to be an astronaut."
TheForest,2w2f9o,slrrp,1 point,Mon Feb 16 15:38:13 2015 UTC,The way trees are collected and the way things are constructed need work. At a certain point I don't want to build anything because it takes too long to run the logs to my base.

TheForest,2w0jl2,RaffoRaffati,2,Tue Feb 17 09:36:28 2015 UTC,"...The upgrades work just fine for me when I reload in 0.13b. Although I started a new game in this patch, are you trying to load a game from a previous patch(really don't think that the game would even start up from five patches ago)? Do the upgrade icons appear when you hover over the weapon in your inventory or is it just the effects that are missing? Hope you're able to sort this out, I have yet to come across this bug. The Devs said that saves from previous versions may be a bit buggy in 0.13b and to start a new file if that's the issue, if that doesn't help I might try reinstalling the game after backing up your save file and starting a new game, then if it works try importing your previous save file back into the game directory."
TheForest,2w0jl2,Sticky32,2,Fri Feb 20 01:56:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  EDIT: Upgrade EFFECTS are still NOT carrying over. Added 14 feathers on axe, saved it, came back, swing speed was reallllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyy slow."
TheForest,2w0jl2,weliveinayellowsub,5,Fri Feb 20 02:40:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think they carry over yet.  Why has it been game-breaking for you? It's not hard to get feathers, sap, or teeth. As long as you have the rhythm of fighting understood (block, swing, dodge, swing, backpedal, parry, swing) you don't need upgrades all that much."
TheForest,2w0jl2,Eugenes_Axe,7,Sun Feb 15 23:11:21 2015 UTC,Game breaking to me is not going back to play all that often. Because I don't wanna get more feathers to cut down trees. Then I always have to build around the same area. It breaks immersion
TheForest,2w0jl2,Eugenes_Axe,1 point,Sun Feb 15 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"That's not what game-breaking means in the world of QC. Game breaking literally means the game becomes unplayable, like falling through the floor or not being able to load the game. This might be really inconvenient for you, and I see a lot of other people who really want this bug fixed, but it's not game-breaking."

TheForest,2vxdpr,ThatBannedGuy,2,Tue Feb 24 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"I actually built my base over there when I first started since the natives couldn't reach me there.  It consisted of a log cabin, fire pits, gardens, and stick/rock holders.  I don't think it can be done now since they just updated it to where you can no longer swim or raft while carrying logs. Also in that field near the center of the picture, there is a native camp but none ever seem to spawn over there.   Edit: You can see a screenshot of my base HERE"

Also this would allow you to climb down underneath the water so you could simply walk underwater like it wasn't even there like the cannibals still do(not sure if it will be more, or less terrifying once they learn how to swim, I'm leaning towards more though...).

I can't remember.  This can be tested by setting up a rabbit cage in a rabbit-less area, like one of the islands, along with rabbit traps all around the cage. Then, you can catch the rabbits from a different location and bring them to their new hell- ahem... Home. If they spawn outside the cage, the traps will at least trigger.   Please note that I'm sure that they can go into the water, never to be seen again. I cannot confirm that, but I have a feeling considering the Alpha's track record.

TheForest,2vonyz,Troub313,8,Thu Feb 12 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with armor and everything, but not smelting ores. That would be far too unrealistic. You won't be able to dig a mineshaft out of aluminum and wood. If you could melt the plane parts, that would be cool."
TheForest,2vonyz,TheBeefClick,4,Thu Feb 12 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"I mean a lot of it is unrealistic ,because it is a game. I don't think smelting ore is too far out of the range of this game. I think it should definitely be hard as hell as well. Like the only place to get ore is deep in the cave or something."
TheForest,2vonyz,truthdemon,-1,Thu Feb 12 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"If you survived a plane crash on a remote island, would you be able to smelt ore? I think any features need to have that context in mind."
TheForest,2vonyz,truthdemon,3,Fri Feb 13 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Would you be able to build a log cabin, a bomb, a tree fort, or cut down an entire tree with a survival axe? Hell I doubt half the people playing this game could even start a fire."
TheForest,2vonyz,TortugaDelFuego7,5,Fri Feb 13 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"A survival expert could, so it's possible. Certainly more feasible than building a furnace hot enough for smelting. I like your ideas on weapons though."
TheForest,2vonyz,Seniornosleep,-2,Fri Feb 13 13:44:33 2015 UTC,A survival expert could cut down an entire tree with a survival axe? There is clearly a bit of leeway in the gameplay. I could more realistically build a furnace hot enough for smelting than I could cut down an entire tree with an axe that is half wrench.
TheForest,2vonyz,Seniornosleep,2,Fri Feb 13 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone disagrees that all games require some suspension of disbelief and complete realism. But I think one of the problems with a furnace and smelting is the unrealistic direction it takes the game in. I don't think the game is meant to be a fancy graphics version of Minecraft. If someone crash lands on a forested island, they're realistically probably going to try to do the things that are in the game: find food, build a fire and shelter, defend themselves, etc. Is master carpentry a little unrealistic? Yes, but that's fine, because building a shelter and traps isn't anything we wouldn't expect. But mining ore and creating a furnace? That departs from ""survival"" and starts to look like you're trying to rebuild a new civilization on the island. I think the end goal of this game will likely be to survive, fend off the mutants, find your son and get the fuck out of there.   Maybe it's just me, but it's a lot easier for me to rationalize building a wooden fort to keep yourself safe than it is to set up a working blacksmith. For me, it's the same reason a small garden seems realistic, but plowing an entire hillside would be a stretch."

TheForest,2vmwms,LXA772,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:30:59 2015 UTC,Best answer I have seen and its worth a shot.  Just sucks to have to restart from the last save.  maybe a suicide button or option would be a good addition.

Anything that comes near the front of your player will be set alight and will die shortly. I only use my axes for trees and luggage now because the holding a flaming arrow technique is basically one step away from feeling like you're cheating because you can actually still get killed while using it but its just harder.

TheForest,2vm0ot,TERPINGTON,2,Thu Feb 12 14:31:06 2015 UTC,I tell everyone that its fairly cheap at 14.99 usd. Though its not finished its getting updated every month. This month it's getting updated twice. I think it's fun though sometimes if you don't save after finding something or building something and you go out and explore too far the game MAY shut down on you but in my almost 40 hours of playing that has only happened 4 times and it was because I was dwelling deep in unfinished caves. They have fixed the AI for the most part. You can't be picky though because there will always be times where some cannibals won't engage you unless you go up and touch them or what have you. Today I woke a sleeping cannibal in a cave and he just stood there. Right before that I engaged an octopus mutant and her babies with flaming arrows and there was no struggle whatsoever. For purests that may be annoying but I was low in stamina from the cold and was passively exploring so ill take it as an advantage. All in all its what you make of it.
TheForest,2vm0ot,Trash902,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"I bought at release, on 0.01 for $15 bucks. I mainly just tested new features and explored each update and let it sit for the most part. Even then I felt I had already gotten my moneys worth. And since nobody answered this part, Yes, multiplayer is in, and yes, it's more buggy than single player. If you can deal with bugs and testing the game, then I would recommend it. If you aren't, you are better off watching as this game is still very early into its alpha."

Not sure how the new update might affect this though, as you're not supposed to swim carrying logs now, but you sort of can, it's a bit glitchy. I have a hunting ground and fish pond on the hill above the nearest cannibal camp. Then I expanded by building a fort on the nearest beach, with the island cabin as a safe retreat if needed. Now I'm looking to build a treehouse somewhere central, go cave exploring and take on the cannibal scum, if I dare."

TheForest,2vj0am,Thelostredditor,0,Wed Feb 11 13:03:57 2015 UTC,"Software Developer here, not a clue. It depends heavily on how they've chosen to architect their solution, how weapon modifications are represented and handled in the code (are they player specific, or weapon specific, or player/weapon specific?).

I like the idea of utilising the plane more, and bleeding out (good use for the huge amounts of cloth I have), raccoon hats, quiver, etc. Character customisation would add a great deal to the co-op experience; I hope ( and assume ) the devs will implement something here.  Not so sure about smoke bombs, and the stone / cement construction. That's not to say I think it's bad, I just wonder if that's a direction the developers are intending to take. You're certainly right though, we have the resources around us to make stone walls."

From what I can see, Stranded Deep and the Long Dark are what I'm after, though I really like the simple wooded environment and look of the Forest.  I'm already stuck under 5 ft of snow in Maine right now.  I have to wait 4 months before I can go camping again.

Without them it'd just be monotonous day to day survival walk over here eat some stuff walk over there drink some stuff, make something maybe. Sleep and repeat.  If there were bears and wolves perhaps and an alternate goal like trying to make a boat work or some kind of long range radio."
TheForest,2vbf7n,IAmCross,2,Tue Feb 10 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"I think you might be being argumentative for the sake of it.   The point of Minecraft is to do whatever you want the point of The Forest currently is...there is no point, once you establish food supplies and such there's nothing to do but survive cannibal attacks.   An alternative game mode for the Forest where you do whatever you want, is basically what I want.  Basically, a buffed vegan mode.   Without them it'd just be monotonous day to day survival walk over here eat some stuff walk over there drink some stuff, make something maybe. Sleep and repeat.   That day to day survival stuff, in its current iteration, may not be that interesting.  If the survival aspect was increased where you had to watch your hunger, exposure, thirst, build shelter, hide from storms, etc., it could be a game in itself.   If there were bears and wolves perhaps and an alternate goal like trying to make a boat work or some kind of long range radio.   You don't need a bear, wolves, or cannibals to make survival difficult.  Get lost in the woods.  99% of the time, your biggest fear isn't going to be an animal, it's going to be starving, freezing, or overheating.  Survival, itself, can be a goal.  It's a pipe dream, I suppose.  The game seems very focused towards having a single story thread and surviving cannibals.  Other threads that I've read really want more of a survival aspect built into the game.  I see no reason that the game couldn't have an alternative game mode that had no cannibals but simply ratcheted up the difficulty of actually making it from each day to the next.  The mode is already partially in the game.  They simply need to remove the remaining cannibal assets from the forest, and strengthen the survival aspects that they currently have in place."

TheForest,2v5faq,RandomCalliope,7,Sun Feb 8 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"Addressing some of your other questions:  Mutants can climb stairs. If they get pissed enough they'll try any route and eventually succeed.  They just have to be really determined.  Mutants can jump, but I haven't had one jump onto my platforms unless I had stairs up to it.    They'll ""swim"" or walk under a house.  They come up through your floor when that happens unless your house is high enough and WILL do you damage.  You can avoid this by building platforms around the house in the pond.  They can't go under platforms, same as you.    Fires definitely make you more noticeable.  Unless I'm in a shelter I don't cook where I attempt to sleep.  Mutants can't swim, they walk on the bottom.  If the water is deep enough they can't get you while you're swimming.  Last tested this in v011.  Advice:  Since the game is a simulation of extreme manual labor, once you've put a lot of work into something, or spent a chunk of time hunting/restocking, always save your game.  Have fun.  Push the boundaries.  Eventually you'll play the night game too."

I was thinking of having stairs lead to a plat form, and then use a series of platforms to exit and enter, but I guess that's a no go.  The walking underwater thing rules out the ocean backyard too then :(  For now I only use fire if I get the message saying I need warmth, otherwise I can just use my drying rack.

So far as weapons, I did not know you could light axes on fire! I'll have to give that a go. I take the cheap way and just light an arrow on fire and poke then with it.

I was new and an idiot, so I built a log cabin before walls, and I had to stay up all night holding down that cabin against 8 with my back to the door, throwing molotovs out the window. The next night, 10 or 11 came, so I made a daring escape through the woods at night, and ended up on the run after that.

TheForest,2uz8l8,DEERSLUG,2,Fri Feb 6 13:30:28 2015 UTC,"Coop has a bit of a way to go, a few weeks ago most of the functionality was still client side but they have already done some progress in porting more over.

I still felt the mistake weighing on my decision to buy other Early Access games later on)  Anyways, to the point. The co-op is pretty buggy, and since the server is run on 1 machine it has a lot of minecraft-Esque type issues with connecting, saves and the random physics behaviors every now and then.  The upside, is the dev team is amazing at updating this game and patching. I am sure the multiplayer will only get better, even though it is still fun right now. The game is worth it, but also be aware the game was made for singleplayer. The community asked for multiplayer and the devs added it on as an after thought. This doesn't detract from it, in terms of quality or anything, just the idea that it isn't the main focus of the game so don't judge the game solely on it. (As you would have with TSL or Rust being made for multiplayer)"
TheForest,2uz8l8,Novacaine34,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"Co-op is like a pile of gold ore. Not much to look at but you know there is something beautiful there, it just needs some attention to bring it all out. I'm hoping for some more challenging mutants and maybe a difficulty setting. Random AI behaviors and just unpredictability. I get that the mutants are hostiles but if you make their behavior random to the point that some games are just them watching and vanishing or complete and utter chaos and death, you'll be on edge more and that should be what this game is about. Maybe wounding them might be enough to keep them at bay but if they just back off and watch you, you'll get paranoid and freaked out, or the second they see you they just go full on offence and attempt to kill you."
TheForest,2uz8l8,BeARdBARIAN,-1,Fri Feb 6 21:32:42 2015 UTC,Eeeeh. I think you have really low standards if you're thankful to the devs just for not taking your money and running.

TheForest,2v286p,Wongis,13,Sat Feb 7 04:17:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't really like this. There's nothing more ""fluent""  about HUD bobbing, and I feel like it would be more of a distraction than it would assist in immersion. But that's just my opinion."
TheForest,2v286p,TheDeltaLambda,2,Sat Feb 7 07:02:04 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. And don't they do that kind of HUD bobbing  in some science fiction games?
TheForest,2v286p,TheDeltaLambda,2,Sat Feb 7 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"In a game like Metroid or Halo where it could be reasonably believed that the HUD is part of the character's visor, it makes sense, and actually helps to increase immersion.   If the players want it, maybe it could become an option somewhere down the line, but this is an early access game and they have a lot more to focus on than adding HUD bobbing."
TheForest,2v286p,treoni,1 point,Sat Feb 7 19:51:38 2015 UTC,Best example is Star Wars - Republic Commando.    The HUD is the visor.

To stay friendly to the development style of this team and also implement this idea I think maybe there should be crafting recipes for things like belts/satchels. Want to throw a shit fucking ton of rocks at a mutant? Make a satchel! Need a place to store your de-limber-izer 2000 while you spear a mutant baby? Make a tool belt!

TheForest,2ur12n,FluffyCookie,5,Thu Feb 5 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"If it's in his wishlist, and he's into survival games, then go for it. And if he dealt with Early Access games before, he knows what to expect and won't be disappointed.  I wouldn't say that it's necessarily a game he'll play for hundreds of hours in this state(though some people do that). Most people I know initially played for around 15-20hrs before they temporarily dropped it, and now jump back everytime there's an update. And this includes me as well.  As it is with most Ea.A. survival games, there is no real ""purpose"" to play the game at the moment. It's basically a sandbox to play around in. This goes especially for The Forest. DayZ and H1Z1 have multiplayer interactions as the kicker and Stranded Deep it's very clear message about being a cast away. But The Forest is kind of ambivalent about giving the player a purpose, in it's current state.  Nonetheless I'd still recommend it. Not only because it will ony get more expensive in time, but mostly because it's a gorgeous looking survival sandbox game, with one of the most interesting AIs I've seen in years. It's definitely worth the price and surely won't disappoint."

Personally, I don't think the game has gotten just enough content to play consistently, and even if it did have a good bit more, it still needs some bugfixing, which I am afraid would break the game for me if I tried playing it again. On the other hand, I have been fascinated over and over by the devs for the content they add and especially the AI (which was great even from the beginning). If your boyfriend can be fascinated in the nature of the game and how it's made on top of getting to play multiplayer with you (which I'm sure would add a lot of fun to it too), I think it would be reason enough to get it for him. If you don't think he will show interest in it for more than a week or two however, I don't think there's much reason to give it to him just yet."

TheForest,2ul6xq,Hilgy17,20,Tue Feb 3 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"The first time I played, I was enveloped by the premise immediately so I donned my studio headphones and turned off all the lights to amplify the spooping.  I played through the first 2 days with only seeing a few natives off in the distance, I observed how they acted and was filled with wonder at how harmless they seemed.  On the second night, I was beginning to construct walls around my base of operations. As the fire started to die out I realized I needed to gather a few more leaves, so I scavenged what I could within the ever diminishing glow of the fire. Off in the distance I saw a few torchcarriers sprinting through the night, and it sent a distinct chill down my spine.   ""These fuckers are fast... Wayyy faster than I am,"" was my first thought. My next thought, followed by a deep sense of terror was that these natives aren't just scouting the island, running around like fools in the dark. They're hunting... they're hunting me, and me alone.  The fire was growing dimmer and dimmer by the second at this point, so I turn around and what do you know? A silhouette of a man standing in front of the dying fire staring right at me. The shrill sound effect blasted in my ears from the headphones, and the fire went out: leaving me in the dark not 10 feet from my hunter.  I screamed and ran into the night, taking refuge on a small island in a lake. I spent the night starving and freezing in the rain watching hordes of the fuckers swarm my campsite. I realized then that this was not going to be some run of the mill survival horror game, this was the next generation of strategic cat and mouse dynamics based in a setting that could turn men into children in an instant; and I was in love.  After a while of playing I learned the general behavior and patterns of the natives, and I grew an understanding of what I was up against; which in turn caused the root fear of the situation to subside.  I think that's what is the true cause of fear: the unknown."
TheForest,2ul6xq,JBONE19,7,Tue Feb 3 08:29:15 2015 UTC,"That's just the way of processing fear. They may scare you, but by playing the game you learn about the enemy, and also realize that getting killed has no effect on you personally, so the fear slowly draws away.  That said, I got scared so much at one point that I literally screamed out. I played in veganmode to, well I don't even remember why. Anyway, I knew that you had to enable veganmode everytime you loaded the game, and always did so. But one time I forgot about that, and carelessly went my ways for like 10minutes, when suddenly a guy jumped out of the bushes right in front of me.   Thank god the windows were closed, my neighbors don't need to think that I'm crazier than they already believe me to be."
TheForest,2ul6xq,Pointless_arguments,5,Tue Feb 3 09:43:41 2015 UTC,"The Savages are fantastically realized in this game but I agree, they do become familiar after a while.

TheForest,2ul6xq,Prof_Doom,7,Tue Feb 3 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"I'd actually find it scarier if they made the first few days with only subtle hints of other people being on the island as well. glowing eyes in the distance or bushes rustling with footsteps funning away from you.  The other thing that kills suspense as of now is how easy the enemies are beatable, though. Even if they aren't unknown any more - the should at least be a threat so that the player has a reason to still fear them."

TheForest,2ul6xq,Mike_Brogan,2,Fri Feb 6 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"They also became too easy to beat. In the first versions I had no idea how to beat them without setting any traps. The axe? Useless. It did take something like 30 hits or so to get rid of one of these fuckers in the first version. Then I learned about molotovs and it became easier. But molotovs were relatively rare, because not only did you have to find the alcohol bottles, but also cloth. And to find that stuff you had to explore. But it was always limited. Nowadays you just go and build your base. You get treesap, then you combine your club with some feathers, glass shards and teeth. And bam: 1-hit-kill weapon. Even the mutants running around on the island now don't seem scary. Seems like another game is ruined by being too easy."
TheForest,2ul6xq,Keksus_,2,Tue Feb 3 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"I think they'll tweak the balance once it's in Beta.  I assume their thinking is : get the content in first, make sure your EA customers can survive long enough to test things, find the best balance later."
TheForest,2ul6xq,cain071546,2,Tue Feb 10 23:16:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully. I really think they should limit the upgrading a bit. Throwing hundreds of teeth on a weapon just seems weird. In my opinion every weapon should be able to hold only a handful of upgrades so you have to chose: faster hitting, or stronger but slower? Currently you're not limited at all."
TheForest,2ul6xq,Killerh0bo,3,Wed Feb 11 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"I was very scared I played the first ~25 days hiding in a tree house surrounded by mudfuckers with a wall around the base surrounded in happy birthday traps and effigies and fires it worked well for a while but what kind of a life is that hiding in a tree house shitting your pants?  But I finally found a tactic for fighting them and now I am happily leveling the forest building a GIANT base plus I'm actually able to forage for all the good stuff now my crafting blanket is pretty full only thing I'm short on is soda because I'm still not liking the caves and I hear there is a cave full of soda somewhere...  I also have never found the Spear but whatever I'm killing them with the wood handled axe/Rusty Axe/Axe#2 whatever you call it its the best in version 0.12  All my axes have the same amount of feathers on them but this one is the least stamina using   Scariest thing was when they showed up with flashlights and started leaving effigies with body's on them on top of my walls looking in at me, and every now and the one would actually get stuck on my wall or manage to glitch inside my walls that's when i used the Molotov's    http://www.reddit.com/r/TheForest/comments/2ufeam/omg_i_am_hoked_on_this_game/  http://www.reddit.com/r/TheForest/comments/2ugnz8/oh_no_now_they_have_flashlights/"

If you're playing on a random guy's server who has a terrible internet connection you will get constant frame rate drops and micro stuttering.

Our coop experience so far:   AMD and Intel -> minor framerate drop Intel and Intel -> minor framerate drop AMD and AMD -> 50% drop on FX-8000 with r9, 70% drop on FX-4300 with r7   There's some speculation going on that this has to to with some AMD related memory leak, what ever that means.  Edit: so Intel users seem to have issues too. When we play however it doesn't happen after hours (gets worse with time though) but pretty much immediately."

TheForest,2uhwnt,SungKorean,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:25:58 2015 UTC,you can get in through another area where it looks like a standard cave entrance with rocks
TheForest,2uhwnt,RandomCalliope,3,Fri Feb 6 08:56:07 2015 UTC,"That looks like the cave in the middle of a small circular meadow.  i built a fort next to it after exploring it.  Inside the cave at the bottom of the rope are two spider monsters and many infant spider monsters.  Once you get past those the cave forks. The left fork is the way out, which leaves you at an entrance beneath a cliff, not far from the cannibal village by the large lake.  The right fork has the cassette player you cant pick up, as well as rocks and sticks you can make standing fires with.  It ultimately leads to an underground river with a body floating in it.  There were a couple of cannibals to dispatch.  There is a thrumming sound in part of the cave there that made me think they might put a boss monster in there."
TheForest,2uhwnt,RandomCalliope,2,Mon Feb 2 10:14:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, thats the one. I went down and did some exploring. The first cavern is just a big cave   That then leads onto another cave  From there you can go left or right  Going left takes you out of the cave, going right takes you deeper"

TheForest,2uhwnt,BeardedMenDothings,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:04:34 2015 UTC,"Dude.  I bought the game last week. In my single player game, I started going around the edge of the island (my base is near the beach). I started West, going clockwise, and on my way back, I found this huge native village. It was basically a metropolis compared to everything else I'd seen.   But I hadn't seen any natives ever since I went to the other side of the island. I don't know if it's some kind of glitch or they're just not over there, but it was just me and tons of animals. So I started looking all of these huts. Then I saw that cave entrance. Holy crap.   I decided to continue back to my village but try to remember where that native village is. As soon as I left that hut, I heard that soft, spine-tingling piano sound. I turned around and a mutant was right there. I NOPED out of there so fast.  One day I will go back..."

TheForest,2ud3w4,jabbathefrukt,11,Sun Feb 1 01:32:28 2015 UTC,I like both games for different reasons. The Forest is cool because of the whole cannibal part and being hunted constantly. Stranded deep is cool because it's basically Cast Away the game.
TheForest,2ud3w4,Homsar98,11,Sun Feb 1 05:37:44 2015 UTC,"Both games look great and fun to play, whilst they are similar they are both unique in their own way, and each one will have it's own fan-base.   I just hope people don't start bashing the opposing game to what they prefer and its fan's. It's a great opportunity to try out some fun and amazing survival games, and work together to hopefully create a great future for survival games in general :D"

TheForest,2ud3w4,nbohanes,5,Sun Feb 1 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"Forest and Vegetation comparison was a bit one-sided, unless you would also have added an underwater exploration comparison. :) Other than that pretty good. Another thing to mention is how long The Forest has been out compard to Stranded Deep, that could play a big role in content in my opinion."
TheForest,2ud3w4,Breitschwert,2,Sun Feb 1 12:05:58 2015 UTC,"Well they've also had different development times/team sizes/Gameplay times.  By this I mean The Forest has apparently been OUT longer, but Stranded Deep was in DEVELOPMENT longer.  So it's a 'eh' comparison."
TheForest,2ud3w4,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,1 point,Mon Feb 2 05:55:07 2015 UTC,"Being in development for longer doesn't equal more content or better game. It just meant that they required more time before they felt it was good enough to be shown to the public in Early Access. If they had severe bugs or issues to deal with that were engine related, time could be different, without having a different end result.  I feel like Stranded Deep feels like The Forest at the beginning, with less horror/scary enemies, but the crafting and building system does feel better to me, as you feel more engaged in the world. However right now The Forest is the better Early Access title, because it has more content and is somewhat more polished, due to the additional time. This is of course just my opinion and that might vary from person to person. Stranded Deep is a great game, if you like underwater interactions more than dense foliage."
TheForest,2ud3w4,Breitschwert,3,Mon Feb 2 09:29:32 2015 UTC,I am a fan of both games. It would be amazing to get a mix between the two. Randomly generated islands with the large ones containing hostile factions lol.

TheForest,2u8yg1,the_whining_beaver,4,Fri Jan 30 23:11:57 2015 UTC,I was just going to post something about stranded deep. It is amazingly similar to the forest.   It is a lot of fun. No cannibals (obviously). Surviving and crafting work well. Underwater exploration is awesome. Honestly it is a good similar game to the forest.
TheForest,2u8yg1,abigassbrick,3,Fri Jan 30 23:15:42 2015 UTC,And the good thing about it too is that the worlds are infinite and generate randomly
TheForest,2u8yg1,NikkuRydell,3,Sat Jan 31 02:55:02 2015 UTC,Stranded deep was published before The Forest.  There was a thread about this not too long ago.
TheForest,2u8yg1,BlueSmoke95,3,Sat Jan 31 03:43:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's like The Forest except for the survival aspect of it.  Everything else (but the graphics) isn't the same, crafting system is made different, the ability to ""drag"" items without putting them into your inventory is different (and useful for the crafting system).  I played the game and from what I played, it looks promising.  Can't wait for some future updates :)"

Or think of half-timbered houses; You build a framework from wood and fill in the spaces with clay, straw and plaster. This would add a bit of variety as well as giving more choices in building materials (e.g. in places where logs are rare)"
TheForest,2u8069,Dr_Mottek,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with where you're headed with the idea. It could be used to fill in gaps between logs to provide insulation to make the structure warmer and more resistant to the elements.  Basically, I want to see devs provide more variety in building styles so that everything isn't the same generic wood hut in different shapes and sizes. Early civilizations constructed buildings in a wide range of styles, and just because we're in a forest doesn't mean everything has to be a log cabin. This brings to mind adobe huts that Native Americans constructed in the south-central regions of North America."

What I'd like to see is a 'shoddy' mechanism, allowing you to halfass a wall or platform if you want to.

Multiplayer seems decent but is still obviously very buggy. When building a log sled we noticed it simultaneously crafted two sleds. we could control each sled separately but when placing logs on one sled, it placed logs on the other and the same goes for removing them. So in essence we were able to leave one sled at base and take one with us and i'd farm the logs from the trees, and he would take them off from 50 feet away to put them on our structures.  Similarly, placement of items/buildings does not sync well with both parties. (things being a few feet away on my screen vs his. The drying rack also populates separately for both of us (we can only see the meat we place, and not the other person's meat).   Same thing goes with the bunny trap/cage. We can both see the rabbit being caught, but since he built the cage i wasn't able to take rabbits out of it and i could not see the rabbits when he placed them in the holding crate, but could see them in his hands.  It's still fun but has quite a ways to go."

You start to see a figure from beyond the woods, and something is leaving dead animals in front of your camp, even next to your head while you sleep. Then, one day, while harvesting berries, you notice one of your walls has been torn down. You rebuild it and notice...ape-like footprints near the area. Then, you start searching through the forest, decked out in armor and using a fire arrow, you spot a hulking mass of muscle and fur, devouring a recently butchered family of cannibals.   You aren't sure if you could take it on. You ready an arrow - Fire arrows are basically insta-kill, right? You let one loose into the gorilla, and to your horror you discover the fucker is fire proof. It sees you and bears down upon you like a freight train. You pivot on your heels and launch yourself in the opposite direction. Your legs are becoming sore, and your breath is becoming ragged after almost an hour of hide, seek, run, hide, seek, run.  You reach your camp. Home. You dive in through the door and turn around to discover that the gorilla has already busted the damn thing down. It begins chasing you after you throw molotov after bomb after molotov at the thing, seemingly having no effect. This goddamn gorilla is persistent!   You run up your treehouse and hide in there, leaving a fire going. You can hear the creature stomping below you, sniffing the air, hungrily licking it's lips. You're deathly afraid, but exhaustion wins out and you fall asleep. And as you awaken from your slumber, you see a hulking figure standing above you. The gorilla huffs a breath of hot air and spittle into your face and gets closer. Then, when mere centimeters from those tusk-like teeth, that gaping gullet, it whispers into your ear.

Maybe a Boards of Canada or Tangerine Dream kinda thing, with something a bit more gritty and dark for cave and combat type scenarios."

As for rabbits, I've only killed a few and that was just because of bad coding in their animation made them stop in just the right place."
TheForest,2tyj3g,WolfeBane84,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:07:42 2015 UTC,My first swing (or poke with a stick) gathers leaves.  The second swing usually cuts and gathers the twigs.    I've seen lame rabbits that hop slowly.  They're an easy kill.  I haven't seen any running backwards...  What's freaky is to put a bunch of rabbits in a cage and watch them all do the same animation at the same time.
TheForest,2tyj3g,RandomCalliope,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"As for rabbits, other small game, luggage, and things that can generally be destroyed with a single poke, try the weak spear. It's a fantastic tool.  As for trees, you're not a tree hugger, so don't stand against it. Try to get the tip or the center of the blade through the center of the tree, this generally means giving a little space. Once you can see the spot you need to chop, you can aim for it. Generally about 4 swings per quarter and when it stops spraying chips on impact you've got that quarter / half."
TheForest,2tumnl,dzmowatt,3,Tue Jan 27 16:02:03 2015 UTC,"For those curious, I found out how to get the mutants to attack your base on the surface consistently in patch .08. I did this by essentially 'going to war' with the cannibals, but always leaving one survivor. I also built a huge sprawling base, with many traps all around it, in a sort of 'field of death'. Very much in the fashion of the player in the official 'Trailer 3' from the dev's: http://survivetheforest.com/2014/03/trailer-3/  Then, when I had enough resources, I started caving and bringing the fight to them. That was until one night, I found a spider mutant in a cave just off the beach(which has now been removed with the new patches). I figured out that if I attacked that spider mutant at dusk and set it on fire, my base would be surrounded by multiple armsy's and spider women when I came back to it. Every single time.  EDIT: Unfortunately, none of the mutants can break down my walls. The would just go around them. I don't think it's in the game yet, but I haven't tried since patch .08  Here's another album of the attacks at night: http://imgur.com/a/kK0xC"

It's playable, yes, but clients can't do many things that hosts can, like use a bow, use rabbit traps, light campfires. There's also the desync of player location which gets worse the longer you play.   I would say that fixing bugs in both singleplayer and co-op is already the top priority of the developers.

In the end you have to ask what is going to make a more enjoyable experience for the player, which is tricky because it's obviously subjective.

They are both on the shore (cargo containers in the distance and river (waterfall)) Stay away from those two and you'll be fine. There's nothing in them but ""fall out of the world"" death.  As mentioned elsewhere, if you see a lot of tables, water layer that you can walk through, or starfish on the ground, turn back. Those are the two bugged cave areas.  Interestingly enough, the water wall at the table entrance has shifted to the right far enough that I now see that the left side of this cave originally connected to the snacks, booze, meds, and flares cache ""dead end"" from the pilot and chairs cave. Just be careful for the holes in the world, the walls don't exactly line up with the floor anymore."

The forest is about fighting for you life. Literally defending from people who want to kill you and to try to build up defenses and then survive.   In my opinion, I like Stranded Deep more at the current moment. I like the reality of the experience."

TheForest,2tjbgv,NurseNerd,2,Sun Jan 25 04:38:39 2015 UTC,"I find traps like Happy Birthday and Deadfall super effective, and cost effective at that.  The only thing is they are too buggy to be useful.  By this I mean they are cheap, for the insta-kill they perform, and placing them in the right spots, or just spamming them is sure to net you your bounty.  But they currently don't even kill cannibals, just trap them in a death pose and require a Fire death for an actual kill...and soemtimes refuse to be reset."
TheForest,2tjbgv,FishyJoeJr,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:38:34 2015 UTC,"What about the noose trap? I've never built one myself, mostly because I didn't think there was five rope in the whole game (recently discovered they will spawn in huts). Do they still work?  Actually, maybe that's what's happened. The death traps are bugged into doing the same thing as noose traps."
TheForest,2tjbgv,austindaley,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:50:59 2015 UTC,"The one noose trap I built took days to trap any of the cannibals. The one it did manage to get didn't kill it, but rather restricted the movement of the mutant to a rather large semi circle, so it would bug out and swing back and forth very quickly for a few days under the ground. Finally it tried to attack me and I killed it, but the rope kept swinging back and forth in the same large semi circle. It never would let me reset the trap, so I'd say from my experience it's not worth building until they get the bugs out."

The plane crash sites generally are close to ponds (fish and storage), and of course have hella suitcases.  That said, they are definitely patrolled by cannibals a lot more.

TheForest,2tieyy,old_mold,5,Sun Jan 25 09:06:20 2015 UTC,"I usually start there, then branch out, I love making houses on the beach, some areas are harder to build at than others, the secluded beach is nice but it doesn't have good fishing areas, so it's a trade off I guess... Wherever you can build and feel comfortable at is your own best spot, there's advantages to bring deep in the forest, such as lots of trees. But then you have all sides to worry about, the containers are great, but away from the trees, so you have to haul everything over, but there is endless fish, lizards, and feathers, so arrows are easy and there is luggage not too far away, plus the flare gun, and modern axe as well... But, trees lol"

If fire becomes more dangerous, fire arrows or molotovs should be removed"

However, in the early morning along the beach, you may see the mutants worshiping at an effigy.  Scouting parties, hunting parties, starving parties, all travel in groups of 3-6 mutants. Those eagle-screeches are just their way of communicating either with their party or another party. If two parties meet up, you may actually hear a dialogue of such."

I did manage to spook a deer into running in my direction once, or at least that's what I think happened. I was trying to hit the deer with it, the rock hit a tree on the other side of the deer because I was aiming too high, and the deer bolted my way, but it might have been a coincidence. The only other thing I can think of is using them to distract cannibals so that you can throw it one way and then sneak around them while they investigate, in which case being able to carry more than one would be better. As for accidentally picking them up, I think their collision detection with players' feet is too sensitive, so instead of walking past them they get pushed along right in front of you. That sort of thing should be noticeable in co-op, but then I've never done co-op. I should sometime."

I say this because since block is the only way to avoid insta-death from the 1-2 cannibal shots...picking up a rock suddenly for no reason will ruin your game"

TheForest,2tdbeg,Red_Leader123,3,Fri Jan 23 04:53:12 2015 UTC,"well neither do bombs, but for some reason you can construct an explosive with booze and a random bit of circuitry... what you could do is create methanol from sticks and logs, and attempt to ignite that... or easier than that, there seems to be functional electronics on the plane. Just use electrolysis on water to produce H2 and O2, and use that as a fuel, or find a propane tank. and make an incredibly unsafe potato gun of sorts that just uses rocks?"
TheForest,2tdbeg,ep0nym1,2,Fri Jan 23 05:51:02 2015 UTC,"The H2O2 mix would have to at an extreme pressure to generate that amount of explosive force. Fill a balloon with hydrogen and blow it up, you get a tiny fireball. Not enough to propel a bullet. And if you're gonna pressurize it that highly you might as well just skip electrolysis and use a BB gun."
TheForest,2tdbeg,Red_Leader123,2,Fri Jan 23 10:25:46 2015 UTC,"sure its not much while unpressurized, but relative to liquor, it sure as hell is. more likely that a bicycle pump was on the plane than a BB gun, at high pressure H2 combusts very rapidly, it would certainly propel small projectiles. At any rate, why not just use aerosols, there is no reason there should be a deficit of those on a commercial airliner. more on your balloon, now take that same amount, put it in a rigid container and ignite it, I can guarantee you it will produce an explosion"

TheForest,2tdbeg,chimpan_z,4,Fri Jan 23 04:20:39 2015 UTC,Gun that shoots rocks?  ...how about a sling?  2 cloth + 1 rope = sling   or  2 stick + 1 cloth = slingshot   add a rock pouch as well.
TheForest,2tdbeg,chimpan_z,0,Fri Jan 23 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"It is far from a sling.  It shoots rock shrapnel, not rocks like a sling would.  Wide blast radius, inaccurate, and short range.  Also, a sling would be too similar to the bow."
TheForest,2tdbeg,doublegulptank,6,Fri Jan 23 19:56:14 2015 UTC,can you explain how you launch randomly sized rock shards from a barrel without any gunpowder? I'm pretty sure the devs want to preserve a sense of realism here.
TheForest,2tdbeg,xSchiller,0,Fri Jan 23 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"It's just an idea, I don't have a perfect plan.  You manage to make bombs from stuff you find around, it isn't impossible to imagine crafting some sort of small explosive that works in a gun."
TheForest,2tdbeg,abigassbrick,2,Fri Jan 23 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, timed bombs from computers, which from with my experience computers also have wires connecting to them and also have a battery, and a BOMB, and other various things that are realistic to make a timed bomb from.

Although seeing as how I never saw more than 8 cannibals on-screen at any given time, I doubt tribes are an actual thing at all in this game.   Yes. And while we're at it, the backlight on my car's radio went out. Where are these functioning car radios people talk about?  All that ""radio"" shit was apparently nonsense and Honda has just been lying to us about car radios being a thing because my civic is malfunctioning at the moment...and the si is waaaay past alpha!

I had killed a few normal cannibals and a female ran away and started screaming, a group of 5 came back to the area, then 2 of the bloodied up starving came when I was already mid fight, the cannibals turned on each other and I basically didn't have to touch the starving ones.    I've just started playing this game this patch, but I've been attacked 2 times, they keep howling in the woods where I've left body parts cause I've run out of things to use legs on (I've got 2x large effigies, 1x that just uses the head, and 2x arm effigies).

TheForest,2sxu8r,old_mold,2,Mon Jan 19 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"I put like a hundred teeth on my modern axe, no joke.  With 40 feathers it wont slow down no matter what you put on it, but it still doesn't kill them in one hit.  It's more useful when chopping trees than chopping cannibals.  Just use fire for the cannibals"

TheForest,2sxu8r,NurseNerd,0,Tue Jan 20 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure. Could be they're blocking you somehow. I rarely take them head-on. Sneak up, hit em hard and fast, and most of the time by the time they've turned around to face me I got em on the ground. Usually I can stun-lock em, but I dunno if they take more damage/stun from behind. Edit: Just want to add that apparently they do take more damage from sneak attacks according to the wiki."
TheForest,2sxu8r,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:44:34 2015 UTC,I was led to beleive all axes share the same damage stats and are purely cosmetic right now
TheForest,2sxu8r,NurseNerd,2,Tue Jan 20 00:40:49 2015 UTC,"Might be the case. The other axes seem heavier and slower, so might just be me thinking the plane axe is weak by comparison."

Most do more damage yet swing differently.  Some knock down faster/more often.  Some cut trees faster.  Then again this is all on the user-written wiki so I still doubt the credibility."
TheForest,2sxu8r,NurseNerd,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:13:13 2015 UTC,My crafted axe is pretty good at knocking them on their asses.

Right now you are invincible from anything but fire while blocking.  The only true threat in the game is Tribals carrying flaming clubs, and sharks in a 20 foot radius."

Is this the lake with the boat in the middle? (The one where peaceful music will play when you approach it) or the one further south with the native camp on the shore?  Either way, if a group you can't handle gets inside it's probably better to just leave for a while. Spend the day exploring the other side of the island and when you come back they should be gone.

How long had you been playing without closing the game down or loading from the main menu? How many normal cannibals had you killed in that session?

My main base was huge, I had expanded to two separate locations, I had killed dozens of cannibals and raided the caves several times, but still nothing. I would estimate my survival time at 40-50 days.    Immediately after installing version 0.12 and loading my game I could hear a weird echoing, wet, growling noise in the distance that sounded very familiar... I followed the noise and found my first surface spider! I ended up finding and killing two more on the surface that night. Still haven't seen an octopus topside though."

I'm not sure how stealth armor is supposed to work, if its supposed to degrade over time, if the more you make the more materials it uses up, but it seems like after making a few pieces I can't make more, and when I start up a save I no longer have the leaves or lizard skins on my arms. Occasionally I would have the leaves but not the skins, which is kinda wierd."

Some engines when designing a map have a base line of water in places to state where the map is level 0 on the y-axis. When going into caves you will sometimes see a line of water that you pass and nothing will happen. Yesterday though, I was deep in a cave and hit another one of those lines because it expanded to under the ocean part, and since there is no water up/down controls, it forced me to float up through the ground, and after that, I couldn't get back onto land. But seeing as you were going down a hill, I think it is just one of the nonsensical things of the co-op feature in this game."
