socialmedia,3e25xo,wcstone,5,Tue Jul 21 11:21:42 2015 UTC,"Regardless of it being allowed or not with Facebook's poor organic reach it would be a huge waste of your money.   You're better off taking that budget and running Facebook ads, more people will see them and you'll get a better ROI."
socialmedia,3e25xo,Awittysaying,2,Tue Jul 21 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. You can pick who you want to see your show, and Facebook will report metrics that are pertinent to you."
socialmedia,3e25xo,Berneesio,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Not a Facebook ToS expert, but this is a fairly common thing for brands with big social audiences to do.  Word of caution though: the size of their audience (measured by likes) is mostly irrelevant. A lot of local TV and radio stations gamed and bought their way to big Facebook numbers and are now suffering huge reach penalties because very few members of their audience are actually engaged.  Before you pony up any cash, ask for some numbers on average reach, engagement, and click through. Look through their posts and see how much interaction their posts are getting on average. If they have 30,000 FB fans and only get 2 likes per post, that's a bad sign. You might also consider asking them if they plan on boosting the post about your show.  My recommendation: if you are going to pay for something, make it something that you can measure beforehand. For example, an email list with X amount of verified email addresses that the station has gathered from their viewers, or maybe a 30 second television spot where the average number of viewers is X. If you can't get those specific details, there are probably better places to spend your money."
socialmedia,3e25xo,Zenphobia,2,Tue Jul 21 12:42:39 2015 UTC,"They will make a post about it not sell some ""space"".  I don't see why it would be illegal. If FB caught the posts has irrevelant they will make you pay with low reach."
socialmedia,3e25xo,peaudecastor,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:24 2015 UTC,no its not.. 3rd parties cannot pay you to post anything.. lots of FB pages do anyway

socialmedia,3e25xo,atticus_furx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:27 2015 UTC,"From Facebook:   According to people we surveyed, there are some consistent traits that make organic posts feel too promotional:   Posts that solely push people to buy a product or install an app Posts that push people to enter promotions and sweepstakes with no real context Posts that reuse the exact same content from ads   Beginning in January 2015, people will see less of this type of content in their News Feeds. As we’ve said before, News Feed is already a competitive place — as more people and Pages are posting content, competition to appear in News Feed has increased. All of this means that Pages that post promotional creative should expect their organic distribution to fall significantly over time.   So, even if you do sell ""spaces"" on your timeline, which I don't think Facebook cares because its YOUR brand timeline, you can do whatever the hell you want with it, posts that feel like an ad will just not work. Facebook doesn't care, what matters is your fanbase.   On Facebook you have no guarantee of reach, engagement or traffic if your content does not meet your audience standard. If you think your audience wants to see posts that feel like you rented space to a brand to promote itself... well, good luck with that"
socialmedia,3e2417,Le-Chef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:56:28 2015 UTC,Used them in the UK to mixed results. Comes down to the creative and the product / service being advertised.   You can run the same ad by just targeting by location as that is all local awaerness ads do anyway. Unless I'm missing something.
socialmedia,3e2417,Awittysaying,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"I think the main difference is the call to action buttons i.e. Call Now, and Get Directions vs Buy Now, Learn More etc   Also, targeting by location will only find people who live in a particular area, whereas local awareness ads will target via GPS (i think)  This targeting and the directions button seems a good combination for targeting tourists or out of towners."
socialmedia,3e2417,Awittysaying,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:40 2015 UTC,I completely blanked on the call to action.   Though I'm sure the normal location targeting goes via GPS as it allows you to target people traveling through an area as opposed to people living there.  I don't think you can segment your targeting like that with a local awareness ad.
