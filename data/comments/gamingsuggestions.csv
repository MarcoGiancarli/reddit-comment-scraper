It's pretty far from the Burnout Paradise engine, though, if you're really attached to the arcade-y physics."
gamingsuggestions,3e461q,P13666,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:57 2015 UTC,Might want to try The Crew.

Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, Grid, and Shift aren't very similar to Gran Tourismo and Forza Motorsport. There are a huge number of differences between them. You can't buy and collect cars, you can't tune or paint them (except in Grid I think). There aren't as many cars available. And that's just what I can think of off the top of my head. Some people will come in and say that the physics are a lot better, but professional race car drivers are documented in saying Gran Tourismo 4 and Forza Motorsport 4 physics are indistinguishable from real life. As much as it pains me to say it as a pc gamer, GT 4 (I haven't played the newer ones) and Forza Motorsport 4 are still the best."

I'm sad to say Sci-Fi RPGs are incredibly rare, but I'm gonna keep looking.  On topic, have you tried Consortium? You can walk around your ship (actually it's a futuristic airplane) and talk to people, solve a murder, do combat training, and play an absolutely maddening, mandatory mini-game that you're given no instruction on at all! I thoroughly enjoyed it, until I got to that mini-game which I could not beat, so I unistalled it and have not played it since.   Another thing, the game is really short, like play a few hours and you've beaten it short, but there are multiple ways of doing things, and you'll probably miss a bunch of stuff on your first play through (I completely missed the murder my first time)."

While it is true that you don't need to listen to the sound of those games, you do need to pay a lot of attention to what is going on in the game, and that will definitely distract you from the book.  In the 3 games I listed you can develop some sort of muscle memory and you will be playing them in autopilot at some point, allowing you to focus on the audiobook more."

Just because it's free, don't put it in the same bin with other ""free"" games. You can play the game to all reaches and beyond, without spending a dime.   I was with Path of Exile from the beta phase. Bought  $15 worth of coins, just to support them. I still have some of them. Except for extended storage (something you that comes handy only in late game, but even then you can work without it) everything you pay for is just cosmetic."

Grinding Gear Games has surely lost money on their decision to not offer anything other than cosmetic stuff (and inventory space), and yet they're still doing it. /u/chris_wilson is the lead developer and he can probably better answer any questions you may have about it. Sadly, I can't play that game anymore due to an injury, but it's my favorite in that genre."

I ended up buying more stash room after like 60 hours in game, but at that point I did it because they earned it. I'm up to 500 hours now, for the record. Never felt it necessary to buy more stash, but did so anyways because it's a great game.  Making a guild with a friend will also give you an extra stash, and you can just have extra characters hold loot for you if you're feeling a bit like hording."

It might take a little bit of concentration when you first start, but after that you should be able to sit back and semi-mindlessly play. The game definitely takes a lot of strategy, but you can go at a slow pace since you'll be listening to an audiobook while you play. The story is kind of interesting, but you really don't have to pay much attention to get a gist of it.  Nothing happens during the round of play that you would have to listen to.  Plus being turn-based, you can take breaks especially if you are really getting into the book you are listening to.  Other than playing for fun, I've been playing this game while I show a friend how to play another game (Red Dead Redemption).  Really perfect for something like that, and it is such a fun game!"

gamingsuggestions,3e2sim,poushkar,5,Tue Jul 21 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"It might help if you gave some specific examples of older games that you really loved and more recent games that you tried and couldn't get into.  In general I would recommend starting with some shorter, more linear games, since those tend to be more gripping than bigger, open world games, which can be overwhelming or become tiresome.    A couple of suggestions off the top of my head for shorter, linear single-player games:  Bulletstorm - it's over the top and goofy, but also very entertaining both in terms of its writing, the scenarios it puts you into, and the gameplay itself.  You'll never spend very long in one particular level or location, so that might prevent boredom from setting in.  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.  It's a puzzle game at its core, but it also has a compelling and effective narrative that's told without dialogue.  The unique aspect of the game is that you control two characters at once, each with one of the analog sticks on a gamepad (caveat: you really should play this game with a controller, even on PC).  The game is short and doesn't overstay its welcome, so if you like the gameplay, it's a good choice."
gamingsuggestions,3e2sim,OkayAtBowling,4,Tue Jul 21 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"If story is the focus here then you should probably try something a bit different to the traditional formula:   The Walking Dead Season 1 Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Gone Home Papers Please The Stanley Parable   Those are games where the story is the main focus and there's little to no gameplay though, maybe a puzzle here and there but they are really really good, and since time seems to be a problem these are all relatively short. If you want a more traditionally delivered story then you should try:   Dishonored Bioshock Infinite Spec Ops: The Line"
gamingsuggestions,3e2sim,Nikazio,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"In addition to the above games (which I 100% agree with, these are all fantastic single player games), I suggest:   Metro 2033 Metro Last Light Wolfenstein: The New Order Alan Wake Tomb Raider (2013)   For some shorter indie SP games, check out:     Bastion Thomas Was Alone Limbo"

Unless you absolutely have to play an exclusive like bloodborne or killer instinct (and I'll give you a hint,while they may be good games, none of the exclusives are worth buying a $500 console by themselves) almost everything else is being released on PC.  The Wii U might be replaced soon, but SSB4 is probably going to be supported and played for a long time, so if you're mainly getting it to play with friends or what have you I'd still say go for it.  The reason I say the Wii U is the console to buy is that all of it's games are a completely different experience than what you can get on PC or PS4/XBOX, you can't skip SSB4 and play something similar on PC. But you can skip the new COD and just play battlefield or something."

You travel from one city to the next with a limited amount of funds (supplemented by buying items in one city and selling them in another), trying to make it all the way back to London in 80 days or less.  It's not a very complex game but the great writing makes it come alive and it's quite replayable due to the sheer number of cities and routes available. Baldur's Gate 2:Enhanced Edition:  I haven't actually played the iPad version but it's supposed to be pretty good, and the game itself is a classic.  It's expensive for an iPad game ($9.99), but for how huge the game is it's hard to argue that it's not worth the price. Star Wars: KOTOR:  Great game, and a good port.  The movement controls are slightly awkward, but it's not reflex based so it isn't a huge problem.  You can even play it on your phone now, though the interface makes it a bit tricky to hit some of the smaller buttons. Threes:  If you're in the mood for a light puzzle game, Threes is great.  There is a free ad-supported version that limits the number of times you can play before it forces you to watch ads, but also a paid version with no ads. Crossy Road:  Mindless but enjoyable score-chase game that is essentially just a fancy version of Frogger.  It's free; it does have in-app purchases but they are just for buying alternate characters, which you acquire at a pretty fast rate just through playing the game.  I have played quite a bit of it and never felt the slightest inclination to pay for anything."

The objective system and XP curve of the game leads to much more fast-paced, action-packed game with much fewer lulls than DotA.

gamingsuggestions,3dy744,Psaro-the-Manslayer,9,Mon Jul 20 14:33:53 2015 UTC,"Of the games you mentioned I've only played AC2, and that was a pretty long time ago.  That being said, here are a few I can think of that would fit your description.   Dragon Age: Inquisition - to keep it as non-spoilery as possible in case you haven't played it, relatively early on you come into possession of an old, decrepit castle, which you upgrade with various facilities and visual enhancements over the course of the game.  It starts as little more than a crumbling ruin, but by the time you finish the game it grows into a grand keep. Overlord - a goofy third-person blend of ARPG and strategy-ish.  Essentially, it's Pikmin, but instead of Olimar with a bunch of Pikmin (Pikmins?) you're an armor-clad dark lord with an army of ghouls and goblins.  You have a large tower that serves as your base of operations, much like with DA:I the tower starts in ruins and ends up looking pretty awesome as you add rooms and increase the size of your army.  Not an outstanding game but I enjoyed it; Overlord 2 is a thing, and I believe it was relatively well-received, but I haven't played it myself so I can't help there. You Must Build a Boat - a match-3 type game for mobile, wherein you start on a raft more or less and gradually build it into a large galleon.  The match-3 gameplay is quite fun imo (that is, the specific gameplay quirks of YMBAB, not match-3 in general), and you build the boat by adding rooms, each of which contains a character that can sell you stuff/upgrade stuff/do other interesting things.  Not a ton of longevity (for me at least) since it's a mobile game but it was well worth the $3 I spent on it.   That's all I got.  Sorry those are some pretty weak recommendations, for some reason I saw the title of your post and thought I had a bunch of good ones but when I actually got to writing it I couldn't really think of any.  However, both Dragon Age and Overlord sound like they would be good for you, and YMBAB is a great mobile game overall.  If I think of any additional examples I'll edit them in."

If you are still hankering for more of that gameplay when you finish YMBAB though it's probably worth checking out."

Not only do you need to construct homes for them to live in, you also have to construct them in a way that's convenient for you to access without leaving them exposed to monsters.  It gets more difficult to keep them alive as you progress through the game (though losing an NPC is a temporary annoyance at worst), leading to many players creating 'panic buttons' with wiring and switches to seal off all the doors and hallways to keep monsters from getting at them. Some NPCs even need special houses to sell their full gear, like the witch-doctor (Jungle biome) and truffle-man (Mushroom biome)."

gamingsuggestions,3dzcwk,upboatbot3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. All of them good, yet its still not quite what I had in mind. For my part space engineers is brilliant with letting you design, and to some extent gather resources. But I feel that it lacks a bit in both PvE and PvP gameplay. Persistance is nice though.  Don't starve is also good, and i like it quite a bit - but my main problem there is the persistence - when you die, everything is gone. And i find the resource gathering/building a bit to easy and random. A ""longer"" game with more options is prefered.  H1Z1 and the other Dayz-esque games are again quite good, but in the current state of development i'd rather not put to much effort into them. Also resource gathering and what you can do to form the environment here feels a bit small compared to say modded minecraft with a full tech package.  7 days to die is something i have been following, but not played myself yet - I'll give it a try.  Perhaps a tl;dr of what I'm looking for is the full control over your environment like in Industrial Minecraft- in a persistent all changeable universe with some elements of rpg."

A huge amount of customisability for different playstyles here.

It just doesn't ""feel"" like an Elder Scrolls game, if that makes any sense. Major parts like a justice system were left out for months after launch, meaning you couldn't steal or even kill NPCs. Overall, the game felt more limited, which you might expect, but it's more so than you might think."
gamingsuggestions,3dunqt,ElTimablo,7,Sun Jul 19 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"When I first heard that Bethesda was releasing an MMO, I thought ""that's interesting, but I have no idea how they're going to apply their algorithm for a perfect single player game to a multiplayer game, let alone a massively multiplayer game.""  Now here's ESO. They did things I didn't expect (dodge i-frame mechanics, MMO mechanics like instancing), but it's missing that secret sauce that makes Elder Scrolls games so great.  I'm going to take a shot at describing what's missing:   In Elder Scrolls games, you're the Chosen One. Eventually you peak in power, essentially becoming a God in your little piece of Tamriel. It's hard to immerse yourself in the mindset with 50 other Chosen Ones spamming chat with WTS [green item] and squashing enemies all around you. In that same thread, the game is balanced and organized to maintain a challenge. You can't just skip to the final boss and realize you're in way over your head. This changes the sense of progression in other games. I enjoy occasionally encountering a low level quest in Skyrim. Voice acting in this game threw me off. It seems that the beast races sometimes drop character mid sentence, in both accent and word choice.   Overall, I'm hoping the experience developing ESO will drive some more innovation in the next Elder Scrolls game (and from what I'm seeing about Fallout 4, I'm going to get my wish)."

Internal and external dangers abound.  Rimworld is /extremely/ similar in both presentation and form to Prison Architect, except that instead of building and managing a prison you're building and managing a settlement of starship wreck survivors on a distant, sparsely populated and infrequently visited planet. It's been described by its creator as ""Firefly meets Dwarf Fortress"".  The Anno series, and the older Ceasar series from which it draws its lineage, is sort of like a cross between Simcity and an RTS, with complex supply chains that have to be maintained to keep citizens happy and advance your technology to build better military units. Anno and Ceasar and the games that clone them span a variety of historical and futuristic settings.  Banished is an entirely peaceful medieval town simulation, somewhere between Tropico and Anno, that focuses on complex agricultural supply chains, keeping your settlers from starving or freezing over the winter, and raising their quality of life by providing a wider variety of higher quality goods.  Timber and Stone, Stonehearth, and Castle Story are all Early Access minecraft-esque voxel terrain games where you manage a settlement rather than just control a single character. You set construction and other orders and workers do the construction for you."

gamingsuggestions,3dtobi,Xen0nex,2,Mon Jul 20 08:59:18 2015 UTC,"First off: Dwarf Fortress-likes. There's a bunch, some are great, some are not. The main I would say is Gnomoria. If you haven't played it, and you enjoy DF, play it. It's great. It's basically a less heavy but graphically satisfying dwarf fortress variant.  Then there's also Banished, also a DF-like game where you play outcasts that build a new community in a world like hours (no magic et cetera). It's good for a while, but you tend to quite quickly reach the point when there's nothing more to do in the game, and it doesn't really have much replay value.  Then there's Timber and Stone which is a DF-like with minecraftish aesthetics and quite light gameplay.  Finally, there's Rimworld. My partner has been obsessed with it for months, and I don't blame them. I've spent probably 150 hours, they've spent thousands. It's a sci-fi survival game where you build and try to survive on a foreign planet. You have more direct control than in, say, DF, but it's not an RTS and you really need to manage the mood of your people or they'll lose it. Like Gnomoria, if you haven't played it, play it. It's a must.  The whole SimCity franchise (build large cities), as well as other ""Sim"" and ""Tycoon"" (build companies) games, and the Anno franchise (build on islands). The degree of control tends to vary from slim to a bit more, but still quite little, but the focus is more on the buildings and infrastructure than on the people that live there, so it probably scratches a different itch than DF does for you (it does for me at least).  Dungeon Keeper (and it's spiritual successors Dungeons 2 and War for the Overworld), Black & White and Game of Dwarves have the thing where you can lift up and drop people where you want them to act, but can't tell them exactly what you want to do."

gamingsuggestions,3drjec,IaniteThePirate,3,Sun Jul 19 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"HoI simulates WW2 but at an economic and ideological level   You're a little mistaken here. HOI's economy is a pretty barebones. It's centered around just 6 resources (metals, energy, crude oil, energy, fuel, and supplies). Your production is determined by Industrial Capacity (IC), which is affected by many things, and controls how much units and buildings you can build. It certainly pales in comparison to Vic 2's economy, which is driven the supply and demand of your population and has over 50 types of goods.  Where HOI shines, though, is the combat. Obviously, as a WW2 game, HOI is focused completely on warfare, and probably has one of the most complex combat systems of any Paradox game. With a dizzying array of combat modifiers, supply lines, a completely absurd amount of unit types, and (in HOI3) a complete chain of command, HOI makes the combat of other Paradox games look like Risk."

Certainly, you should have some factions on your good side, but this was for the most part not that hard.    If you played it and just balanced basic needs and the budget, you missed half the game.

Haven't played the never ones (the latest was Empire), but in the ones I did play diplomacy in the vanilla version was somewhere between terrible and atrocious, you simply couldn't rely on anybody or anything. Mods helped there a bit, but there's only so much the community could do with what they were given.   And what do you mean by ""running your lands""? For me, this was a purely economical challenge.

The people in your country will participate in your government, build factories and railroads, migrate from region to region and country to country,form the basis of your military, and join uprisings if they're pissed enough at you.  The game is centered around this population system, and that's why I say Victoria 2 is a game about population, not economy and politics.

It's got combat like an action game, with dodging and rolling and aiming. It's free-to-play as well without any gamebreaking pay-to-win aspects.  Otherwise, I'd recommend GTA 5. It's online aspect is amazing to say the least. If your computer can run Witcher 3 it should definitely be able to run GTA 5. It's very well optimized. It's really a lot of fun, especially playing in first-person."

gamingsuggestions,3dop15,SawedOffLaser,3,Sat Jul 18 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"Alright. I will suggest a few for a couple genres. These are all on Steam, this assumes they are not on sale.    Shooters:  Counter Strike: Global Offensive: online shooter, emphasis on tactics and team coordination, best played with friends  Painkiller: old-school FPS, blast demons with a ton of awesome weapons, little story, great level and visual design  Left 4 Dead 2: zombie shooter, fight waves of zombies trying to reach the end of a stage, comes with Left 4 Dead 1 maps, tons of mods, best with friends  Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball: colorful online shooter with dodgeball based gameplay, great music  Return to Castle Wolfenstein: older fps, blend of modern and old school, linear shooter, but a ton of fun to run around and shoot Nazis and monsters  Deus Ex: Human Revolution: excellent shooter with RPG elements and amazing story, varied options including run and gun, stealth, hacking, etc.  POSTAL 2: shooter about your week in a messed up town, plenty of violence and offensive humor, not for the easily offended    Strategy:  World in Conflict: RTS where the setting is the Cold War goes hot, has a strong campaign with a bit of story  Sins of a Solar Empire - Trinity: space RTS at a planetary scale, command fleets, conquer star systems, defeat enemy ships, research and more  Rome: Total War: grand strategy with real time battles, old but great game, lots of diverse factions to play, comes with both expansions, which are also great  Medieval 2: Total War: Like Rome, but with many improvements, tons of playable factions, 4 expansions with very unique scenarios    RPG:  Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition: excellent open world RPG, post apocalyptic setting with retro-futuristic elements, FPS oriented combat, huge array of mods available, comes with 5 major DLCs, WARNING: game takes some tweaks to get working properly, fixes can be found on steam forums or via google  Fallout: New Vegas: Ultimate Edition: sequel to Fallout 3, improves on all aspects, 4 major DLCs, even more mods than Fallout 3  Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition: challenging but rewarding fantasy RPG, has online elements, WARNING: requires a fairly powerful machine to run, port is very poor and requires the mod DSFix to work properly, only play if you have a controller  Mount and Blade: Warband: RPG in a medieval kingdom, focus on realistic combat and commanding a small group of soldiers, no fantasy elements    These are just games from my Steam library. I can probably recommend more if none of these spark your interest. If you want to know anything else about anything listed, just ask."

I am in the same boat. As far as atmospheric games (i.e., Bioshock), I would argue you won't have enough time to sit and actually get absorbed into a game like that. Believe me, your baby girl will suck you out of the gaming world fast!   Think, ""what can I play in 10 minute intervals and feel satisfied with?""  I would stick to the strategy and sim games as they tend to be easy to just stop on a whim when needed. In fact, Civilization 5 really hit the spot, so easy to stop and start back up when needed.  However, do you have a 3ds? I have been playing my 3ds like crazy  since it is way easier to pick up and play at random times. I would let your PC or console collect dust and just downsize for a year and go portable. In that case, play Super Smash Brothers 4., those 5 minute online matches are perfect for your baby lifestyle right now. Also, the wife is less likely to bust your balls when you aren't staring at a big computer screen in a dark office."

I've actually been thinking about going portable again, however I can't decide between a vita or 3ds. Really tough call. I really don't like the 3ds market as compared to the vita, but I love the exclusives way more than the vita, though I think the vita has a wider library. Decisions suck."

Oh yea, and the pandas you are talking about are more like little racoons.  Not like the pandas from WoW.  But you are correct on the lolita kawai anime-chans.  You will see many people dress this race up in bunny outfits and swim suits and what not.  I find it hilarious and it keeps tera enjoyable to me seeing what lengths people will go to.

I'm not saying these races are uncommon in MMO's or shouldn't have a place in them, but you have to acknowledge the fact that someone who doesn't play MMO's (i.e. the type of person to ask for MMO's just like what OP was asking for) would be offput by races that are commonplace in other media, whereas op probably wouldnt' be put off by something like the Azura from Guild Wars 2 which are admittedly out of place but are not comparable to anything from anime.

Another game you might want to try is the game built by Arkane prior to DMOMM, Arx Fatalis. DMOMM started life as a sequel to Arx Fatalis and is its spiritual successor. It's older and definitely shows its age. Maybe someday we'll see a spiritual successor to DMOMM related to Arx?  Also, if you played DMOMM as stealth/assassin, it borrows heavily from the old Thief games (as does Dishonored) if you haven't played those."
gamingsuggestions,3dkldm,ximenez,2,Fri Jul 17 01:40:55 2015 UTC,"I'll take a look at Arx Fatalis; with games as old as this one I gotta check how well it has aged, some older games that were fun back in the day are basically unplayable. And then there are always these compability issues with Win8.   Thief might be a good idea, I played the original game a bit. But you won't get the feeling you're evil, right? And combat is....well, you're a thief. Perhaps I'll give it a try when I find a good offer because reviews have been mixed."
gamingsuggestions,3dkldm,ximenez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:53:41 2015 UTC,"Fair warning, Arx Fatalis has aged a lot... If you run into issues getting it to run, check out http://arx-libertatis.org/ which is a modern port of the engine and allows it to run better on modern OSes.  Yeah, you can't really be evil in Thief. Definitely look out for deals. You'll see the original trilogy pack come up on sale for a couple of bucks often.  Sort of a random suggestion but take a look at Jedi Academy. Older but has aged really well. Allows you to be good or evil. Has great melee combat that is a lot of fun."

It's not really like Dark Messiah in terms of atmosphere (Dark Souls is much, much darker) and isn't played from first person perspective, but it's a really great combat-oriented action RPG with a really good combat system nonetheless, so take that as you will.   About the morality in this game, it's much more ambiguous than simple good/evil, but you can be evil if you want to, although the concept of evil isn't often obvious in this game."

Being fantastic at a role, and having others who are the same for different roles, really makes a team, and if you're good expect praise.   It's made by Valve, so you've got an established and respected company behind it. And while they don't pay it as much attention as DOTA, they still provide updates and balances, and is something like the fastest growing e-comp game as well as the 3rd most watched tournaments.  The only issue for you is that:   PVE is essentially non-existent. It's team based and the bots do jack all. There isn't an endgame (unless you consider the highest rank an endgame - I know I do).   It also does have a payment system, but only for completely superficial weapon skins to show off... but, in saying that, never underestimate the strategic importance of swag.

gamingsuggestions,3dkcnt,EdenFragment,2,Fri Jul 17 10:15:36 2015 UTC,"Get dawn of war, winter assault, and dark crusade. I think soul storm is OK... Better campaign but the new races they added were so so.. Wait.. I should explain..  Dawn of war has a campaign and has these races to play in the campaign: space marines, orks, eldar, and chaos. You can get winter asault which has a new campaign and unlocks imperial guard. Then dark crusade also has a new campaign but unlocks Tau and Neurons (both are pretty cool) and soulstorm has a campaign and unlocks sisters of battle, and dark eldar (meh). So by the last game you can play the campaign with 9 different races if you have all the games. Remember though they are all standalones, you just won't have all the races if you don't get the other games. I hope that makes sense.   Its a good game if you like RTS with some different mechanics that make it pretty unique and you can have some EPIC battles. This is the game that started my 40k obsession and I think it has some repeatability since there is so many races. Remember though, if you think one is too stale or didn't age well, try the expansions because they are the same idea as far as the campaigns go but are usually more polished and have more mechanics.   Also DOW2 isn't really a normal RTS so ita totally different than the dawn of war series. But check out a let's play or something to see what it's like."

I got terrified after playing the game thinking the movie could potentially be that bad, I'm really not a fan of ""lol, so random"" humour.  Thankfully I'm told that the movie is inspired by a Joe Kelly run which receives much more praise.

It's also got co-op even if it's really hard to find who you're actually looking for.  Lots of build variety to experiment with and great combat.  DS2 is also quite good.  Also you may want to check out S.T.A.L.K.E.R. if you haven't.  It's not really an RPG as there isn't a leveling system but loot and exploration are super important to your progression in this series.  The feeling of finally finding armor or a decent weapon after spending all this time running around in a hoodie/blue jeans with a pistol and a crappy shotgun is great.  Might be co-op with a mod but I think multi-player is mostly pvp.   Edit:  Both these are open world.  DS is seamless and STALKER has separate zones you move freely between."

Just stick with it until you break through the wall so to speak.  I tried over and over again for years to get into the Souls games but always gave up after an hour or two.  Last year though it finally clicked in my brain what I needed to be doing and it's since become my favorite franchise (sort of.  It's tied with STALKER).  Actually I find that stalker and the Souls games have a lot in common in terms of challenge, atmosphere, and how the story is something you discover through interactions with characters and the world rather than being something that is force fed to you.  So yeah stick to it maybe take a peak at a guide if you're really truly lost and I think you'll be rewarded with one of the richest experiences games have to offer."

Ground Control.   this game is super duper old, but the gameplay is great, imo. IIRC, its the predecessor to World In Conflict, same developer, though I think Ground Control had more original ideas and gameplay. the publisher kind of pushed them to use more mainstream mechanics in games after that.    XCom: Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within.    turn based/tile based. like Final Fantasy Tactics, but more sci-fi. units start out with modern weaponry, but they adopt alien tech as you progress. overall, its a fantastic game vanilla, and there are some pro quality community mods that rebalance the game very well.    Dawn of War 2    ok, not so much modern, because its the sci-fi warhammer 40k universe, but its made by relic (same dev that made company of heroes, so you might dig it.)"

It's widely considered to be one of the best ever made. The Gamecube version is the definitive edition, with some expanded content including some extra secrets and end game bounty hunting missions. It's ~80hours of fantastic, old-school-adventuring fun.  Kirby's Air Ride and Chibi-Robo are a bit more niche, wouldn't really want to recommend either without knowing what sort of games you're into. From what I remember they're quite a bit shorter + simpler as well, £40 might be a bit on the pricey side. Depends how much your money is worth to you, I suppose. If you want a single player Gamecube racer, you can do better - FZeroGX for example.  But you really can't go wrong with SoA, unless you're a die-hard JRPG hater (and even then...)."

gamingsuggestions,3des8h,BardicPaladin,3,Thu Jul 16 03:35:51 2015 UTC,"The Borderlands series is what you want.  It's an FPS game that you can play with up to 4 people. You can have your own solo campaign, and then invite friends to drop in at any point. The more players there are in the current game, the more enemies spawn, the harder the bosses are, and the better the loot is. Enemies and chests are found everywhere containing various types of loot, and loot consists of thousands of randomised variations of gun types, as well as shields, relics, skins/outfits, and character mods that grant you powers.  There are a wide variety of gun types and gimmicks for guns; you have revolvers that fire explosive balls, shotguns that shoot tiny flamethrowers, sniper rifles that fire bullets that split into more bullets and more bullets the longer they fly, rocket launchers, electric assault rifles, grenades that explode in showers of battery acid, etc. Loot comes in rarity grades and can be traded with friends/strangers online.  You create characters of various classes (Gunzerker, Assassin, Siren, etc) that are similar to Diablo classes. Each class has its own skill tree; earn experience points from killing enemies/bosses and doing quests/missions, and every level-up lets you invest in a big tree of class-specific skills. One class gains the power to freeze enemies in bubbles or teleport around, one gains the power to turn invisible and run at hyper speed, things like that.   The quests are usually simplistic (variations of kill this or that person, clear out that tribe/area, find this special item, etc) but are funny/lighthearted, and often involve amusing boss fights. One mission, for example, revolves around a friendly, adorable rogue AI that begs you to plug it in to various electrical devices, then immediately takes over those devices and tries to kill you with their new miniboss form; every time you beat it, it apologises and asks you to plug it into something else ""and this time I really am sick of trying to murder you, I promise.""  The settings are pretty varied, too -- a haunted zombie Halloween world, a mutant hillbilly wedding, a weird Dungeons & Dragons game.   The game is pretty much Diablo, but with guns, first-person perspective, and a kind of comic-book silly world.  The downside: if you try to play with strangers, you'll find that most of them are at level 50-70, so it's hard to join a fun game of people your skill level when you're playing for the first time. This probably isn't so bad if you live in the USA and play 6-11pm but as an Australian, I rarely found games with <lvl40 players. It's totally possible to solo the game though, if you're okay with that, and you can buy the game for friends and play through the whole campaign together for maximum fun.  Also, unlike Diablo, melee exists as a secondary option; the focus is definitely on guns. You can go all-melee if you pick Zer0 and specialise but there are some bosses where getting in melee range is suicidal, or where you need to shoot weak points."

gamingsuggestions,3dfe1h,Bwian,2,Thu Jul 16 02:11:58 2015 UTC,A Link to the Past and A Link Between Worlds are both great. I also really really like Link's Awakening which is on the 3ds virtual console. As for 3D Zeldas my favorite is Majora's Mask but that's maybe not a great one to start with because it's pretty atypical compared to the other titles. I think the best 3D Zelda to start with would be Twilight Princess. A lot of people will recommend Ocarina which is also good but I think without any nostalgia for the game you would be better off Twilight Princess since it has about a decade of polish over Ocarina.

You'll start a quest and it'll look like it means almost nothing, but then it opens up and shows you the lives of people who just a moment ago meant nothing to you.   Between the two I think they made the combat much more simple. And the item system is better to. Like you no longer have to sit down and meditate before using oil or a potion. The only thing being you still have to apply an oil before a fight, which is a little annoying because you don't always know what you're going to be fighting around the corner.

The game is about collecting and battling monsters in dungeons. It's not the prettiest game but mechanically it's very interesting. The game is turn based combat; you encounter new monsters while exploring 'realms', which you extract 'cores' from, and when you have three of these and some other resources either found or earned in battle, you can summon the creature. You can have a party of up to 6 of these monsters, each having a unique ability. You also can find, craft, and enchant items which you equip these monsters with.

Dragon Warrior 1 is pure grinding, all the way.  It has historic significance but the plot is practically nonexistent and the combat doesn't have much depth besides ""He attacks.  You attack.  He attacks.""  It introduced a lot of staples of the genre, but you may not find it fun enough to play all the way through.  Dragon Warrior 2 introduced multiple party members and travel by ship.  There still isn't a lot to say about the story, though, and the gameplay is mostly the same.  Dragon Warrior 3 is, admittedly, the one I played the most on Nintendo.  There are a few allusions to Dragon Warrior 1 later on in the game, so having played the original is nice.  This game allows you to build your own party and has a lot of exploratory freedom once you get your vehicles.  There's still grinding, but it does a very good job giving you the sense that there's a whole world to explore.  Dragon Warrior 4 starts a move more towards modern story-driven JRPGs: the game is divided into chapters where you learn the backstory behind each of the main party members.  There's more dialogue and party interaction, which makes it feel a lot more contemporary than previous games with their silent protagonists.  At the end of the day, they're all 8-bit RPGs, though, so you may want to skip them all in favor of the Playstation ones.  But if you want a retro game experience, I'd suggest giving 1 a sporting try and going to 3 and 4."

Perhaps it was because I played it first, or because I didn't have a nostalgic, emotional connection to Symphonia like many people have, but I liked Xillia the best out of them all. And Xillia 2. Symphonia was fun but many interesting complexities available in Xillia aren't in Symphonia just because it's so much older. i would definitely recommend playing Xillia before Symphonia, but some people may say otherwise. If you love Xillia, then check out some older games, like Symphonia or Graces."

The StarForce copy protection they use install an incompatible driver which will blue screen your computer possibly to the point of a HDD reset. or even if windows 7 just blocks it the game will fail to load because StarForce installs 3 drivers all 3 of which it needs for any StarForce protected games to run which windows 7 will delete. If you want to run them you'll need a crack from a warez group (SkiDroW, RaZor 1911, BlacKboX, etc) to bypass that to run. I own 2 of the games on disc and i wont install them due to the bluescreen thing.  Personally i'd recommend Medal of Honor: Airborne since its missions are based of real world missions EG: Operation Market Garden and has era/location appropriate enemys (EG First mission is in italy so you face Italian Black Shirt Infantry and Nazi SS Officers), some new drivers use an incompatible PhySX version for GeForce Cards, but installing legacy PhysX fixes that. The weapons are also realistic and it has a Unique leaning system and an accurate paratrooper theme. but i repeat DO NOT under ANY circumstances install Brothers in Arms on windows 7, run it in a HW accelerated Virtual Machine, any recent processor can handle that much as the games are single threaded."

In Rise of Venice you basically go and trade goods wherever you want using your ship and try to make a profit.   Seriously play it if you're into trading. Sometimes disasters occur in some cities like fires meaning they'll want more wood in order to repair the city so you can trade wood for larger prices during fires.

You can try Nosgoth which is the closest thing I'm aware of to what you're looking for. It's Humans vs Vampires with some projectiles (no swords, sorry) and a healthy amount of melee and magic. It's in beta and the community is kind of small but it's very playable.  As an aside, if you've never tried it and are getting bored of the 'standard' shooter formula, I highly recommend Team Fortress 2 as a highly polished 'alternative' style shooter with a fantastic community. It has swords and abilities which could be considered magic, although guns are still the focus.  Here's a list of upcoming games which fall in various points along the spectrum of gritty military shooters and pure fantasy. None of them meet your criteria exactly but you might find them interesting.

The only thing that could possibly come to my mind is Age of Empires series... Just set everything to peaceful and you've got a city builder! I could also suggest other RTSs which you can play on peaceful but aoe2 normally makes for prettier cities.  Another game I can think of is Train Fever, which is a transport game which starts you off about 200 years ago. Unfortunately, things don't get to look that much different over time.  If you don't mind the fact that there is a tiny social and war aspect to it, forge of Empires does an interesting age progression system. However they recently added the ability to noble (take over) other villages, so it's slowly becoming like their flagship game, Tribal Wars.

There are 4 difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Classic, Impossible. Classic is the ideal difficulty level - demanding, but not frustratingly so.  Ironman is a setting that removes the option for you to have multiple save files and autosaves after every turn, so you are forced into owning your every decision.  Classic difficulty, Ironman mode is arguably the preferred way to experience XCOM. You will be pushed, you will not be able to reverse any bad decisions, and you will absolutely feel the sting of those decisions.  XCOM is the kind of game you asked for. Be ready and don't fuck up.  Also, be sure to rename your soldiers with the names of your family, your friends, and any other people you know. It will make the experience more impactful."

Combat is done in a Final Fantasy Tactics style: the battlefield is a grid and you move your party members around to attack.  There is some strategy involved: for instance, spells take a set amount of time to cast and targets can move out of AoE spells (or attack the spellcaster) before they're cast.  There are also ""limit break""-style ultimate moves that allow you jump ahead in turn order.  Also, the interface is extremely easy to use, which adds to the fun.  Cursors automatically appear on the last targeted enemy so there's a minimum of mouse-fiddling: if you're in a hurry you can click your way through a battle.  And also, enemies appear on the overworld so you can steer clear of them if you don't feel like fighting.  My main problem with the game is the story, however.  It mostly relies on well-worn anime tropes, but boy oh boy, is there a lot of talking.  I hope you like listening to dialogue and then walking to another nearby location and listening to more dialogue.  What's odd is that despite all the dialogue, the story isn't that deep and the characters are pretty one-dimensional.  If you like talky RPGs and have a fondness for anime, you might enjoy it, but there were a lot of times when I just wanted to go back to the fighting."
gamingsuggestions,3d364w,GaiusPompeius,2,Mon Jul 13 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"Combat is done in a Final Fantasy Tactics style   Not really. I mean, it has moving and attacking on a grid and spells take time to cast, and the similarities end there. The battle maps are all perfectly flat with no obstacles, no varying terrain at all. Also, rather than FFT's story battles and random battles with completely random enemy parties, TitS seems to cycle through a handful of pre-designed enemy parties per area. Which means, as soon as you've figured out the optimal strategy for a certain party, you just have to repeat that strategy the next time you encounter that party, modulo whiffed attacks and the like.  The two good things the combat has going for it are the S-breaks and turn bonuses. But neither of them have kept me from finding the combat mostly tedious.  In any case, I'd say it's closer to a Lunar game that it is FFT.   It mostly relies on well-worn anime tropes, but boy oh boy, is there a lot of talking   Hmm, I don't know if it's really all that trope-y. Mostly it just overuses the same one gag. Yeah, yeah, we get it, Estelle is the rambunctious one and Joshua is the responsible one, which is the reverse of the usual gender stereotype. (Granted, I'm only about 10 hours in.)  That said, I actually do like the characters and dialogue. The whole cast thus far has been extremely likable, and I've found myself more invested in them than I do in whatever is going on in the story."
gamingsuggestions,3d364w,VyseofArcadia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"A fair point: FF Tactics definitely had a lot more depth to it.  I mostly meant to draw a parallel with the grid-based system and character movement, which is different than the basic turn-based combat of Final Fantasy with its stationary party members.  And especially in some of the later battles, strategy can often be the difference between victory and defeat, something which a lot of other RPGs don't do (usually, a boss killing you means you have to go grind some more.)  I don't dislike the characters, but so often they take five minutes to express something that could have been clearly communicated in thirty seconds, and I don't think that the characters have enough depth to really justify the time spent talking.  Yeah, Estelle and Joshua didn't do it for me, because once you've seen one conversation between them you've seen them all.  (And really, Estelle's incest-ey crush on Joshua was kind of painful.)  I wasn't tired of them by ten hours, but by the end of the game I was just skipping through dialogue.  Don't get me wrong: I like story in RPGs, but so much of what they say is either small talk or else exposition of things I already knew.  The script needed an editor, in my opinion.  Yeah, I know it sounds weird for me to be recommending this game, but a lot of people seem to like the story, so it could just be me being too picky."

Are you just looking for a great story full of flesh out characters with depth? Or are you looking for an action game from Japan?  I liked Penny Arcade's On the Rain-slick Precipice of Darkness 3. The third part had a fun time mechanic and a SNES look to it. I linked the Steam page to give you an idea about the game but it is available on XBLA, iOS, and Android I believe.   I've heard Xenoblade Chronicles is a winner, though I haven't yet gotten around to playing myself."

Cloud in a Bottle, Hermes Boots, stuff like that. Try and make a grappling hook ASAP. They are invaluable for exploring.

Now i kinda wish i would have done them in order, but if i hadn't played 3 i wouldn't have been able to get through the start of 1.   Witcher 1 gets a lot better once you get the hang of things, so somewhere in chapter 2.  If you can get past the visuals and the simplistic combat, the story is on par with the rest. I recommend reading some guides on leveling, so you don't screw up and make it harder.   I honestly liked 2 the least. It looks almost like 3, but there's a lot less content. Both the main quest is shorter and there are very few side quests.   If you really don't want to play 1 and 2, then you can easily skip to 3. You won't know some of the characters that well, but if you're interested there is information in the glossary in the game."

Danger is what drives you to build a shelter, stockpile supplies and weapons, advance technologically, and so on.  Reign of Kings might work for you? There's no fantasy monsters or anything. It's multiplayer only, but the systems of the game seem to be intended to encourage people to form alliances among themselves more than mindlessly attacking each other."
gamingsuggestions,3cyom4,JoshwaarBee,3,Sun Jul 12 01:57:18 2015 UTC,"I know you want a forest setting, but Stranded Deep seems the closest to what you want as you didn't want snow.  It's PVE, has a simple, yet logical crafting system.  It's brutal at times, but very rewarding as well.    Another option is Life is Feudal where it is set in castle-age times and you start out with jack crap and have to scavenge and build everything.  It is more along the lines of collecting food, wood, stones, mining, farming, trapping, etc.  You can play it single player, but really the devs of the game are eventually planning on making it a sort of MMO.  It's very realistic as far as the amount of time you  must spend to do the actions you want.  For example:  before you can build a hut or cabin, you have to flatten the earth and make the ground even so you must take a shovel and dig up ground where it sits too high and likewise dump earth on low spots.  It's very labor-intensive but there are no antagonists in the game if you start your own game and play solo.  Most of your games with forest/wilderness settings incorporate zombies or some other type of fantasy antagonist like The Forest where there are mutated humans living on the island you land on."

Something similar:   Far Cry 4: focused on killing people, no survival elements, but it has a good mountain/forest setting and quite realistic. Haven and Hearth: indie MMORPG. It came out as alpha stage first in 2009 or something, so technically it is ""modern"". Heavily focus on survival, and the world is super huge. There's not many people playing it and you may go solo all the way. Skyrim: with mods. Hunterborn, realistic needs and diseases, and Frostfall(or some camping only mod, as frostfall makes the game winter simulator). Go to Falkreath or Riften hold and camp on the wilderness, role play it out.   But considering everything, what you need is the Long Dark summer forest version, and there's nothing like that, at least I can't think of one. Good luck on your searching!"

How you interact with characters in the story ranging from general conversation to ambush tactics affect the game's story and direction. Multiple different endings as a result.   The combat can often be difficult if you don't know what you're fighting, but eventually you are able to learn about a creature through reading books, fighting them and winning, talking to NPCs, or even trying different things in combat. Each 'monster' has a fighting style; Nekkers for example will go for quick jabs, but once one hits you and you stumble they all flood you with attacks. Foglets attack from behind often, and Griffins will swipe you with their wings once they've got you close enough. Just to name a few.  The environment is ridiculous. So much detail, everything is explorable, and everything is interesting. Look up some gameplay, I was surprised how deep of an experience The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was."

gamingsuggestions,3cw4g3,Miltrivd,2,Sat Jul 11 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"I gave it a shot actually. I found the Witcher 2 to be extremely difficult to play. I've heard a lot of the fans found the combat in 2 to be the worst in the series. Asides from other issues with running it, I left it and went straight in for 3.  I decided that would be okay seeing as in a lot of countries its advertised as ""The Witcher: Wild Hunt"" dropping the 3 in the hopes of having more people jump on board. Like when Mass Effect 2 was released on ps3 way back when.  I found the story really easy to follow, characters are still interesting and you get some backstory as well. Especially when you ask for it, there are a few times when you can say ""oh hey I kinda forgot about that... remind me please?""  I thought about posting to /r/casualconversation about it, because I have never played a game with quite so much detail and richness to it.

gamingsuggestions,3cw4g3,themosthoney,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"+1 to witcher 3. The roleplay experience and world design is just incredible. Personally i didnt like Witcher 1 and 2 because of dated graphics and i didnt follow the books. I quit 2 after 15mins but 3 is just simply amazing. You dont have to play 2 but it does help you to be less confused about the story in the beginning.  The combat mechanic is fun at higher difficulty settings in the same way Dark Souls is.  Basically, you have 5 spells which you can customize as you level, while the sword fighting is very action-y like Dark Souls (i.e tons better than skyrim). At the same time, its not as difficult as Dark Souls.  Its a must play for RPG gamers!"

Combat is quite polished and are based on weapon class/moveset so by simply switching weapons you can have a whole new playthrough.  The game is quite immersive on level/world design, sound design, progression and story (a story that's played, not told).

It doesn't have as much combat but it's still a pretty fun stealth game.  If you like Insurgency you should try Red Orchestra 2. It's similar in that it's a ""realistic"" FPS meaning people die quickly. It's set in WW2 and it's a lot of fun imo but I'm not sure how many people play anymore. If you're going to get it make sure you get the Rising Storm game as that gives you access to the Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer as well as the Rising Storm multiplayer (same game but instead of Russians v Germans in RO2 it's Americans v Japanese)."
gamingsuggestions,3cwi6d,JoshwaarBee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:12:41 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Massive Chalice for the last few days, since it's free with XBL Gold, and it's great fun. If you've played XCOM, you will have a good frame of reference for what it's like.  It's a top down small-squad strategy game in a medieval fantasy world, where you take the role of an immortal king, defending his realm from the slow assault of 'The Cadence', an all consuming, monstrous shroud that encroaches upon the Kingdom from all angles. As the King, you must train your loyal warriors, of Heroic blood, as your first and only line of defence against the Cadence, by leading them in battle. However, the titular 'Massive chalice' which is the source of your power will require 300 long years in order to prepare to completely dispel the cadence, and no hero will live that long, so you must also guide the survival and growth of these heroes' bloodlines, and breed yet stronger warriors to face the mounting threat against your Kingdom.  Both the Squad combat and 'base-building' metagame are really quite deep and interesting. Heroes have 'traits' which are inherited from their parents at birth and may never change, as well as 'personalities' which are influenced by their parents, trainers and sometimes squadmates, and can change over time. There are 3 'main' classes of Hero, but breeding together 2 different classes will result in a new variant class.  There's a lot more to it than that, but it's really good fun, and you can pick it up and put it down at a moment's notice. If you've played XCOM and liked it, this is a fantastic way to pass time until XCOM 2. Or if you haven't played XCOM, play this anyway, because if you like Massive Chalice, you'll love XCOM."

Basically, if you look at Europa Universalis IV, it's somewhat like a much more difficult and much more advanced Civ, using real world map, actual historical provinces (thousands of them, literally) instead of hexes, real nations with their (mostly) real alliances and rivalries. Pick a nation and go through four centuries (1444 - 1821) doing whatever the hell you please. It is mostly war-oriented, but there's plenty of diplomacy involved as well.  Watch out, though - it's much harder than Civ, and you'll really have to learn the mechanics first. The tutorial might be somewhat lacking, so you should probably just look for some videos on Youtube, there's plenty of people there doing playthroughs."

gamingsuggestions,3cwc98,FixxxerTV,2,Sat Jul 11 10:27:56 2015 UTC,"Try FEAR's sister game Condemned: Criminal Origins.  It was made by Monolith around the same time as FEAR.  Condemned was their horror game, FEAR was their fps.  And Condemned is a far better game.  It's quite linear though.  If you don't like linear, you won't like it.  It came out in 2006, so you will get 2006 graphics. But it is widely considered one of the scariest games ever made.  It has more than jumpscares.  There is a specific scene in the game that blows people away with how clever it was in freaking you out.  I won't say where or when it happens, cuz it will ONLY freak you out if you don't know it's coming. But it's bloody brilliant.  Amnesia and Outlast are both good suggestions.  Pick up Outlast's DLC as well, it's worth it. Outlast is quite gory and has full frontal nudity, just so you know.   Additionally, check out Among the Sleep.  Story is told through the eyes of an infant.  It's quite short and not cheap, so only get it on sale.   The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is another great one.  Not a lot of action here.  And I can't tell you much of what it is about or the setting because there are spoilers... but to summarize: you are an investigator with.. paranormal abilities(?) and you investigate a missing child.  The game is gorgeous. Try to avoid looking too much into it... because many descriptions tell you about the setting and it is better if you don't know the setting. DO NOT WATCH THE OFFICIAL TRAILER because it gives too much away.  You can watch the first 20 minutes of an LP and get a good idea what the game is about without any spoilers.  I did LPs on Outlast+DLC, Among the Sleep, Ethan Carter, so google my username if you want to see them before you buy."

With regards to Torchlight (I assume you mean Torchlight 2) I highly recommend installing the Synergies mod - it adds a ton of content and a few extra classes.  I too love this genre and although it's not specifically an isometric point-and-click game I have to highly recommend Borderlands 2; it's basically a FPS ARPG with a solid (and hilarious) story line. Might not be exactly what you're asking for - but it's so good that I still have to recommend it :)  With regards to Grim Dawn I would actually suggest holding off until it comes out of Early Access - it's a great game and a solid entry in the ARPG genre but once you finish the current storyline content there isn't a whole lot of replay value I found (shows a lot of promise when it is a finished product though).

Maybe not incredibly well, or with great settings, but still playable. It's not a terribly graphically intensive game. (Unless you mod it.)    not an anime-game    Oh no, no worries there. Fairly realistic, if grungy.     pixelated graphics would be ok, but better if not    No pixelated graphics to be seen here.     maybe an indie game?    Not really indie, but certainly not AAA high profile studio trying to rake in the profits on Same Shit Different Name 35    customizing would be great or crafting, etc    All of your weapons and armor need to be maintained, you go to the mechanic and have him fix it up for you. This can get a little tedius, and sometimes expensive if you let your gear get into a bad way and haven't made enough rubles to offset the cost. But you're gonna want to visit him anyway, to see what upgrades he can do. Maybe you have a short supply of .762 but have more 9mm than you know what to do with, so you have him modify it to make it more usable. (This is just an example, each weapon has a set upgrade tree, and some items on the tree are mutually exclusive. If you change your mind on an upgrade, though, you'll have to find another gun to upgrade from scratch.)    not fast-paced    Not at all, unless you count the moments of terror when a pack of blind dogs swarms in on you and starts to wear you down. Mostly it's fairly chill, engaging one or maybe two enemies at a time, unless you have a full group at range. Unless you screw up, that is.     maybe some shooting? Not necessarily    LOADS of shooting. And occasional weapon jamming, if you don't do regular upkeep on your gun. And loads more shooting. Just remember: You're as fragile as your enemies, but by the same token, your enemies are just as fragile as you.     Not a MOBA    Nope, not at all. More of an open-world sandboxy story-driven experience, where the environment is as deadly as any other human with a gun. Very atmospheric."

It's a single-player turn-based survival game that's kinda in the same realm as something like DayZ. You travel around a post-apocalyptic environment scavenging for clothing, food, weapons and equipment while defending yourself against various enemies. Crafting is also a gameplay element.  There is a main storyline to follow, however it is pretty much optional. The game is very replayable as you can start up a new game, go in any direction and do whatever you want.  Might be worth having a look!  It's also available on GOG, if you're interested."

Divinity: Original Sin is an awesome homage to classic western RPG games. There's also co-op, which is a blast to play.  Lastly, Prison Architect. I have dumped a STUPID amount of hours into this game. Probably of the best building management game I've ever played. There's a huge amount of content, but the developers really listen to the community and release monthly patches based on the feedback they get. They even have a youtube channel where they discuss the state of the game/show off the new patch every month. It goes on sale fairly often, but I'd say it's easily worth the full price."

Final Fantasy XIV, Elder Scrolls Online, Guild Wars 2, Rift (if you want a f2p WoW Clone), Sw:Tor are just a few good MMOs.  Head over to /r/MMORPG and look at the sidebar. The most popular MMOs are listed there.   They may not keep you busy 12 hours a day for months and months like Everquest 1 or Star Wars Galaxies did back in the day, since the genre has evolved so much and sandboxes are only slowly starting to pick up again, but there are so many MMOs to explore nowadays that you will be busy for years or at least until your games come out."

I decided to go with GW2 and I played it 8-10 hours per day for month until I pretty much got all end game gear and got bored. It is too casual, and I reached my goals so fast and burned out. I have read every single thread on /r/MMORPG unfortunately, and everybody says that there isn't good MMO available, and there is huge nostalgia for older games. FF XIV has horrible graphics for me(I hate that style), ESO is meh, questing system sucks afaik, Rift(If it is WoW clone I might as well play WoW, I really don't mind paying subs or B2P, but everybody suggest me to stay away from WoW), and SW:TOR isn't for me because I hate Star Wars.

gamingsuggestions,3cqie8,ParadoxicGer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:41:05 2015 UTC,"Oh well, seems like there is just nothing for you. You chose the most casual MMO of them all, no wonder why you got bored but if you don't like the other big ones there's nothin I can recommend since you won't like them either. I'd say go play Project 1999 or try one of the Ultima Online Freeshards or the Star Wars Galxies Emu but you probably won't like the graphics then.  If you don't mind, then those are the most 3 hardcore games you will probably have ever played and even after months you'll probably only have scratched the surface. Until you level a char in Project 1999 up, it will take a long, long time since you lose a massive amounts of XP when you die, you lose your gear if you don't get it quick enough, no quest markers, grouping pretty much required - but like I said, this is probably too hardcore for you or you won't like the graphics since those are old games.  Either way, you probably have to search for another hobby then, I'd say, until the games you are looking forward to are coming out."

Wolfenstein: The new order The Witcher 3: Wild hunt Counterstrike: Global offensive Civilization series Don't starve Bastion The elder scrolls 5: Skyrim    I do not know if the curse can be lifted but these games worked for me.

gamingsuggestions,3co8fo,Mrlector,2,Thu Jul 9 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"Update on Lichdom. So. Omfg. YAAAAASS. I got it. It's perfect. You can literally build spells any way you want them, you choose a base element (For example, I'm currently using Fire, Lightning And Kinetic), Each has a Single Target and AoE version spell, however you can can modify parameters with sigils to change the blast type, the effects of each spell, enhance properties. For example, with Kinetic I started with a simple Push spell, which did damage and slight knockback of the enemy and the AoE had an entangle spell in which it would root all enemies in the radius. I modified them with sigils to craft a new single target version which became a ray which add the effect of lift with a high crit chance, so my spell would constantly damage a single target with a beam criitting repeatedly and levitating them making them unable to function. I changed the AoE to have a high chance status effect, a pool effect so when cast it would keep a field active for a short time which while in the pull it would, again, lift the enemies making them easier to hit with other spells, or other AoEs (Because you can switch between three elements at a time) ...

And you can combine any 2-4 runes to make more spells (there's a ridiculous number of combinations IIRC). It's fun and challenging but it's missing some polish maybe that would make it better.  Also if I recall its stats system is a bit mathy.  Another game would maybe be A Valley Without Wind (1, not 2). I might be wrong but I think there was some element of spellcrafting in it. If not, it's still a fun sidescroller regardless.  Magicmaker is another game like Runers with a ton of runes/combinations but it's a sidescroller. It's more polished than Runers but for some reason I went from enjoying the hell out of it to suddenly losing all interest in it."

gamingsuggestions,3coppd,tsundere_salad_bar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:51:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's based on revenue, not income per turn. You can spend every bit of dust you earn, but still have super high revenue and out muscle all the other players.   Endless Space also has a neat feature in its diplomacy that allows you to form ""coalitions"" for lack of a better world with other AI players, and it works pretty well IMO.  The combat is card based paper rock scissors, which I actually like - or you can auto resolve."

The GBA Fire Emblems allow grinding but don't encourage or make you do it, and grinding can still result in permanent death. But in terms of balanced play, I'd say the Gamecube Fire Emblem and the Wii one, Radiant Dawn are very balanced. No level grinding, a Bonus Experience system exists in which you can administer experience at will to help weaker units, however, but both games have good tutorials and are pretty well balanced, IMO. The GBA ones (exc. 6) are balanced as well, but have level grinding as an option, which you might not care about, IDK.  TL;DR: Try Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Radiant Dawn, Fire Emblem 7 and Fire Emblem the Sacred Stones. Awakening can make you too OP with pair ups, making it far too simple."

You can select pre-existing nations and their leaders or claim a province and start your own dynasty.  You will have to manage relations with both your vassals and with other nobles within and outside of your kingdom.  This can be accomplished diplomatically by creating marriages with your bloodline and eliminating rivals to inherit other thrones or marshal your armies and claim it by the sword.  They have a really good handle on the grand strategy genre. Another one of their titles, Europa Universalis 4 deals less with the relation between bloodlines and more with the interactions between nations.  Creating alliances and managing aggressive expansion with coalitions.  I highly recommend Paradox Studios work for you to look into."

You can trade between NPC stations, build your own stations and production networks, setup player owned NPC Trade ships to supply your trade empire or trade on their own for your profit.  Trading is far from the only thing to do, there are lots of sectors to explore and a plethora of ships to pilot; fast scout ships to a capital class carrier or dreadnaught and everything between.    There are even a couple story lines to follow, but you aren't limited in anyway by ignoring them. It is single player though,  if you were looking for multiplayer options.

Reviewing the keybindings to make sure you know all the actions available will help, as well as installing some of the total conversion mods like XRM, or litcube's universe will really make the game run smoother with a lot of the little irritations in the UI smoothed away.  There's not a huge over arching theme to follow.  I always set myself little goals to work towards.  In the Litcube's overhaul there is an invading alien species that slowly takes over the known sectors.  My goal in that was just to build a production network, with all the factories, space docks, and carriers I needed to continue constant ship production with my Player HQ.

Check the trailer and some lets plays for a better idea. (You'll also get a steam key once it's on steam).   Stonehearth I can't recommend at this point in time, although it shows promise and the dev team are active there just simply isn't enough content yet. I got a few hours at most out of it. Check back in a year.   An alternative to stonehearth is timber and stone.

Lets say I am using the basic rifle, and my enemy is a good ways off. I can either take the chance and shoot for a headshot, or go for a safe body shot. If the headshot connects, its likely a one shot kill, but there is a high probability that I will miss.   There are also weak spots that differ depending on the vehicle or enemy.   Different weapons are better for certain things, but instead of always delegating an SMG to short range encounters, you can still pick off enemies at range with headshots with the SMG. The game simply says ""Pick a target, this is where your bullets will go"" and you can tweak your weapons to your play style. I have mostly long range units with two armored rushing units in most encounters."

It also meets all of your criteria.  Ark: Survival Evolved.  Ark is a survival RPG  set on a tropical island inhabited by a variety of dinosaurs.  Your character levels up and you control the stats. This character is persistent so no resetting on death, you only lose items.  Throughout the game you can tame Dinosaurs. You can tame carnivores for pvp and base destroying, and herbivores for collecting items, defense. There are also flying dinosaurs which allow you to travel great distances and take in the view of the amazing graphics.  A lot of the game is about base building as well as survival and you can build a variety of cool structures which are extremely customizable.  You also level up your dinosaurs and can make them very tough. There's a PVE option and a single player one.  The only problem is it takes a decent computer to have the game looking as good as it's supposed to. Also the more people you have the more fun you will have, so a team is very good here."

gamingsuggestions,3ck63u,Conco14,2,Wed Jul 8 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls and Demon Souls are great games, but they are challenging. If you aren't looking for challenge and don't consider yourself a competent gamer then I'd avoid both of those titles.  Red Dead Redemption and The Last of Us have the best stories out of what you listed in my opinion. The Last of Us is my favorite game of that year. Probably top ten in my list easily.  Edit - I love the Souls series so let me clarify. The games punish mistakes ruthlessly, but the game is fair. I've played every Souls game and never once felt ""cheated"" by the game. Every death was followed by the thought ""Fuck I messed up that dodge. Well I should of done this instead. I'll try this new strategy"".

gamingsuggestions,3ck63u,PUSClFER,2,Thu Jul 9 03:39:47 2015 UTC,"I'll throw in some short personal thoughts on the games I've played from your list.  Metal Gear Solid 4  While the game series is very popular and well-known, the gameplay can seem challenging at times due to its somewhat unique and complex controller. On top of that, it revolves around a story that's been built up for the past ~17 years. Catching up with the story will take some time, and this one is the last game in the timeline, meaning it's not the best place to start if you want to get into the franchise.  Dark Souls  Highly challenging, and highly rewarding. This is a great game if you want a challenge, and enjoy immersing yourself in the game. It features a bunch of cool boss mechanics, gritty graphics, and a decent soundtrack. The franchise is definitely worth having experienced at some point if you're interested in being part of gaming history.  Assassin's Creed III  There's a whole bunch of games in the Assassin's Creed series that doesn't really differ all that much from each other. This one is personally one of my favorites though because of the time setting (which many others disliked from what I understand). A lot of people appreciate games that takes place in a world that's open to explore, and the Assassin's Creed games are great at that.  InFamous  One of my favorite games for the Playstation 3 (and again with an open world to explore). The gameplay is great fun, and you can choose how you want to play the game (good or bad), which has certain affects on the story and the living world itself. I'd like to recall the game being quite graphically impressive as well, although I haven't played it for a long time.  Killzone 2 & 3  Generic and somewhat gritty first-person shooters with cool art designs and fun gunplay. From what I recall, the story was pretty interesting and well-delivered too, so I'd say this is well worth the play for that alone.  The Last of Us  Highly recommended. I'm not too big on zombie survival games, but this is more than that. It's easy to relate to the characters, the dialogues are great, the music is great, the story is great, and the level of immersion is great. Seriously, this is one of the best games for the Playstation system, period. Definitely give this game a try at the very least.  Red Dead Redemption  Same as above, really. Great characters, great dialogues, interesting story, and on top of it all, a large open world to explore. Another of the best games on last generation's consoles without a doubt.  Prototype 1 and 2  I can't remember much of these games, other than that the gameplay felt pretty repetitive in the long run, and the world feeling somewhat gray and lifeless. I think the second game made the gameplay a bit more interesting via some sort of skill-based system that gave the player a sense of character progression. Might be worth a try if you're into open world games.  Demon Souls  Pretty much the same as Dark Souls. This was the game that started it all, so it might be fun to have experienced for that reason alone. I've read that plenty of people consider this one the best out of the Souls trilogy.  Uncharted 2 and 3  Reminds a lot of The Last of Us in terms of gameplay, storytelling, and animations, but less focus on zombies and survival, and more focus on adventure and treasure hunting. (Think of it as Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider). Uncharted 4 has been announced for the Playstation 4 as well, so it might be reason enough to catch up on the series in anticipation for that one even if you might not currently own a Playstation 4.     In conclusion: Definitely try The Last of Us, Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3, Red Dead Redemption, InFamous.   Consider trying Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Assassin's Creed III, Killzone 2, Killzone 3."

It's a roguelike dungeon crawler where the goal is to reach the top of the tower, but you can bring loot back to town if you find the ""escape crystal"" and don't die.  It takes many trips before you're advanced enough to make it all the way up.  There's also a heavy pet-raising mechanic (you can bring a handful of combat pets in with you every trip), and back in town there's a dating sim element where you can romance the local girls between dungeon trips.  Recettear has some rogue-light elements to it: although it's an item shop game, you can opt to play through dungeons with one of several adventurers.  It's pretty easy if you go in decently geared, so don't expect a challenge anywhere close to Rogue Legacy."

gamingsuggestions,3ch2b4,the_grandmysteri,2,Tue Jul 7 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"TLTR: Great game if you are into the idea ""Uncausual-match-3 steampunk permadeath light RPG mech battle""-Game  Ironcast is a really fun game, with some challeging moments.  The Rouge-like or better light part is permadeath and round base with some random missions (but no random dungeons or something).  You play an ironcast fightig against other ironcasts (Some steam powered, mechanical mech) with the resources Heat, Cooling, ammunition and repair parts.   Each round you have to keep on walking (Cooing and Heat, for evade), shooting (Cooling and Ammo, for offense), keep up shields (Cooling and Heat, for damage resistance) and keep your systems and bot online by reparing damaged parts (hull isnt repairable during a mission, but undamaged systems keep the damage, partly, from getting to the hull).   You only have 3 turns per round to gather the 4 different resources (If your lucky you get an connector on the match 3 field to gather 2 or more resource at once). So you have to decide which resources are more important (Keep the shild on high level or shoot the enemy). The 5th resource is scarp, the money, to buy new parts and repair the hull between missions.  After you killed one or more enemys you often get blueprints of a part of his system or if you are lucky the part itself to improve your mech.   After you complete a mission (and build chains) you get XP which improves your hull and gives you with each rank a passive or active bonus for your mech (5% more damage, 5% more scarp, ""next shot 100% hits the enemy"").  Your whole XP goes after you died to the global progression and improves your next round a bit (3% more XP, new Mechs, new pilots).  Overall a really silly and unique idea of mechanic combinations. I have over 25 hours in in (Beat it after 17) only one achievement missing.   This are my complains: - If you killed the final boss and got the achievement your are mostly done with the game. The rouge feature of infinite replayability is not there. Reset the global progression is the only way the play challeging again after on a high level. - Some times it is really frustation the you can't shoot and power up shield and drive because you don't get 3 cooling on the match 3 field in a row."

For those who enjoy languages or are multi-linguistic, there are alternative AI voices for the Titans in other languages, which I enjoyed immensely.  I also felt that some of the maps were a little small for Titan combat.  Other than that, the gameplay is pretty... Normal for a modern FPS.  Very low risk and safe, but it plays well because of that.  Watchdogs runs along the same lines in terms of being a good copy of something else.  I enjoyed the music selection as well as the ability to hack into cameras and such to scope out areas before I entered them, and use them to spring traps.  The driving physics were just a little wonky though, which did frustrate me a bit.  Also, outside of missions, the ability to use hacking in creative ways was a bit limited IMO.  Between the two, I'd choose Watchdogs."

There is one scene but I'm not sure you can fail it. it also definitely has time sensitive parts.

Also requires first person wasd movement, which might be a bit much for a newcomer.    To The Moon.   Unpopular opinion but I think this one probably gains a lot if you either are used to nerd culture or have nostalgic feelings about this particular art style. Somebody lacking of this might not get why they it is necessarily that superior to just reading a short story.     Papers Please and This War of Mine have German subs.   Or how about Valiant Hearts, the World War 1 game from UbiArt?   In case you want to give her something that might actually be more fun than impressive, any chance she might something like a city builder ala Sim City? Or one of the more artsy puzzle games? Like Monument Valley on the mobile platoforms? Not as artsy, but maybe something like Kami, Splice or Fieldrunners?   Have you considered something like the Telltale Law and Order game? It's not a master piece, but it has zero time sensitive bits and it has German subtitles.   Or if you want to convince her that game are good, why not play something together? Something that will be fun and make both of you laugh. Like Octodad or Trine 2 together. Or show her videos of people playing the Wii together. If you can show her that games can also help people connect and have a good time together (tell her consider for example people in long distance relationships where one of them is away at school or something) maybe that could have a similar effect as just showing her something artsy."

My mother is a fan of Agatha Christie's whodunnits and gets bored by CSI (and can't look at the gory parts); whereabouts does L&O fall on this scale?   The game is mostly about questioning people. Like you have to pay attention to the dialogue and then the games asks you whether they were lying or not and you have to click on the right option why they are lying/being truthful.   Like you meet a character and he says ""I was on my way to London"" and during the questioning he says ""I wasn't fleeing the country! I was just about to visit my lawyer in Florida"". All the talking is in English though, only the subtitles are in German.   There are a bunch of Sherlock Holmes games, including a new, fairly high budget one.

I ask because Daedalic Entertainment is a German publisher of some of the most beautiful pt-click adventure games that will surely have German Sub/Dubs in their games.  Their stuff tends to have hand-drawn graphics and animation, nice music, and a world that often stresses the realm of imagination.  Specifically, the Whispered World, the Night of the Rabbit, and Dead Synchronicity (no zombies) would be nice.

The game is diverse enough for you to choose a casual lifestyle for your character during the day at work and something more intense in the evenings at home if that's what you'd like. There is PVP combat, legion warfare and tons of farming and labours skills to just sit back and do while not having to be constantly worry about the world round you. From plowing, planting and harvesting fields to processing what you harvested, mining for ores, breeding and birthing animals, slaughtering them for food and hides to make leather.... the list goes on. It is free to play with sponsorship from city or guild so nothing to lose in trying. If you're on the fence, have a quick read at Avalon: The Legend Lives"

gamingsuggestions,3cef9s,Moogle55,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:39:13 2015 UTC,"Valkyria Chronicles relatively recently was ported to PC and seems to be well liked. It's got an interesting WWI-ish setting with tactical play, but realtime/analog elements to moving and making shots for each squad member's turn. It also sounds like there are skirmish battles you can grind with. I bought it, but I haven't gotten to play it yet. You'll notice this start to become a pattern. For what it's worth, I've heard almost nothing but good things about it despite few people knowing much of it.  Have you tried Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall? They don't exactly have as much grind but they are a fair amount of playtime and relatively cheap, often on sale. I quite enjoyed SR Returns and own Dragonfall which got even better praise... but haven't gotten around to it. Another installment, Hong Kong, is aiming to come out soon. I already kickstarted it, so that's going into my backlog as well. It's also somewhat mod-friendly, and some of the mods aim to add numerous or repeatable runs, though I haven't tried them either. The games' plots aren't really connected as far as I know, so don't worry about jumping in at Dragonfall.  Depending on when or how you played XCOM, the expansion Enemy Within came out and added a lot of new gameplay variety. There's additionally a mod called the Long War on top of that (and an older version exists for the base game) which significantly extends and expands the scope, length, and complexity of almost all aspects of the game. Yet again, I loved the base game and now own the expansion but haven't tried either it or the mod yet. As far as I can tell both have received high praise from people looking for an extended and involved XCOM experience.  Finally, maybe a long shot; Massive Chalice has gotten some mixed reviews. Between somewhat simpler tactical-style battles it's got generational bloodline building, so it's a different kind of grind. A lot of Steam review cons revolve around the gameplay cycle growing repetitive and lacking varietal growth, but it sounds like that may not be as much of a concern for you? I also own it... but haven't yet gotten around to try it, so I can't give it a big yea or nay. Maybe try getting it on sale?  The others hritter mentioned, Invisible Inc and Banner Saga, are also on my list of games to buy and hopefully get to play. Sorry for being long-winded and moaning about my backlog to you. Hopefully something there might tickle your fancy."

I haven't gotten around to the Long War and might never. I keep my current Enemy Within roster from doing the research to start the ending in motion so that I can just keep doing crash missions and the like until the end of time. :P"

You weren't really specific on what kind of game you want.  Oh and if you want to try an MMO (like WoW but not created by greedy cunt company blizzard) then I can recommend TERA, I managed to put 54 hours in and was enjoying it but decided that MMO's weren't for me.  Another big pc title would be planetside 2, biggest open world shooter in existence. Currently has the world record for having the most players in one battle at around 1150.  Underrated title, go play Starmade. Like really you must go download it. It's completely free and It's honestly its amazing. Think of no man's sky mixed in with minecraft and eve online."

And I've heard of the crazy things that happen on Planetside, and sounds like a hell of an experience. Especially with so many players. I'll have to check out Starmade as well. Unfortunately not a big MMO dude, tried a few in the past and also decided that wasn't my thing. But aside from that, thanks for the suggestions."
gamingsuggestions,3cawrt,WolfGirl7777,6,Mon Jul 6 14:03:48 2015 UTC,"PS2 has a huge library full of great classics like Okami, Shadow of the Colossus, Odin Sphere and God Hand. I recommend that one, especially if you want RPGs and action games.  Though Wii U has a few good games too, like The Wonderful 101, Super Smash Bros., Bayonetta 2, and eventually Xenoblade Chronicles X.  Really, it depends on what you're looking for. Though PS2 would give you alot of bang for your buck if you don't mind diving into older games."

With a huge library and a long list of classics, the PS2 is one of the greatest consoles of all time. Everyone should own  a PS2"
gamingsuggestions,3cawrt,Nerevarine87,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"Do you own a Wii? If you do, then definitely get a PS2.  Otherwise, it's a tougher call.   I would say the Wii U has some good games for sure, but the fact that it plays Wii games is the best reason to get it. Though frankly if you don't have a Wii, I would just suggest getting that, and that way you get access to Gamecube games too. PS2 has, in my opinion, one of the best gaming libraries out there, especially if you're into RPGs, and it can play PS1 games which is yet another phenomenal library.   If you don't have a Wii, I would say it's a bit of a toss up, either get a Wii if you want Nintendo exclusives, or get a PS2 if you want some of Sony's exclusives.  In other words, get a Wii or a PS2. If you already own a Wii and just want to upgrade to Wii U, get a PS2 for sure.    EDIT: The reason I suggest a Wii over a Wii U is because I firmly believe that;  Wii + Gamecube Library >> Wii + Wii U library"

Another murder mystery-ish game that came out is White Night, which I haven't personally played but have seen others play and looks very cool though it's more about seeing a mystery played out rather than exactly solving it yourself."

gamingsuggestions,3ccvee,ZtheP,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:17:19 2015 UTC,"Law and Order Legacies is an older Telltale title. It's more about remembering what people said previously than about reading their body language, so you might find it even more too easy. (it also has an aspect where you have to decide when to throw in an objection during the trial part and how to justify it, as well as having to make decisions like whether you should cut a deal or what punishment you should go for)"
gamingsuggestions,3caw8k,LeahLovesSmut,8,Mon Jul 6 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"Yakuza 4. Which I highly recommend if you're into serious and cinematic stories like Metal Gear Solid. Oh and remember the dramatic hand-to-hand showdown in MGS4? That's pretty much all of Yakuza's boss battles, but even more fun to fight. Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. It's from the same team who made Final Fantasy Tactics. Though the overall narrative and feel is closer to Game Of Thrones. Asura's Wrath. Can be pretty tragic at several points, but overall one of the most epic action games out there. ICO & Shadow of the Colossus. 'Nuff said. NieR. This is probably one of the most melancholic action RPGs, or games in general, ever. You're a father looking after his terminally-ill daughter in a post-apocalyptic fantasy future Earth. It's a spinoff game of Drakengard, and it has a sequel announced for PS4 (I'm so excited!!!!) Drakengard series (forget Drakengard 2, it had a different director). If you're familiar with Berserk and Neon Genesis Evangelion, then you'll know what to expect from Drakengard, a dark medieval fantasy series where it's part hack n' slash and part dragon-riding aerial combat."
gamingsuggestions,3caw8k,gianttabby,2,Mon Jul 6 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"I second Nier. The soundtrack is fantastic, it takes a few playthroughs with the multiple endings to get most of it. It was by far one of the most unexpected good games for the 360."

gamingsuggestions,3caw8k,gianttabby,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"Nope. You have a theater mode that gets you all caught up on previous events. I only played through Yakuza 3 all the way, but I find 4 to have a more compelling plot and satisfying ending."

gamingsuggestions,3caw8k,hritter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:53:58 2015 UTC,"Chrono Trigger and Radiant Historia for some time travel plots.  Chrono Cross is also good but it's very polarizing to some.  I personally like it.  Terranigma is an underrated gem.  If you can stomach the retro-ness and the grinding and one particular boss (hint: it requires magic to pwn.  nowhere in the game does it tell you this), you'll be rewarded with some very rich philosophical undertones."

There are others as well.   Chrono trigger + cross is amazing. For CT, there is a fan based sequel that is also very much worth playing. It helps tie CT in with CC."
