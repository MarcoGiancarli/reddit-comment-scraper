Elsanna,3e30ct,coolfolder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"'Fae' is a catchall term for a supernatural being, usually associated with a forest setting.  Their exact nature changes from story to story.  Fairies are the most common type. In this case we can surmise that a 'snowfae' is a magical arctic fox (or similar) named Elsa :)"
Elsanna,3e1rit,streatrat234,22,Tue Jul 21 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"I know there are people who use ""they're fictional"" as their prime argument for getting around the incest issue, but that doesn't really cover it for me.  Personally I have no issue with incest, in principle. I'm accepting of any relationship between 2 (or more, I suppose) consenting adults. Regardless of race, gender, relation, species, kink, what have you. Mostly I'd rather be spared the details, but as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter what people do as long as its what they want, and it doesn't hurt anybody not explicitly consenting.  Beyond that, the moral issue with incest comes from the detriment to the health of offspring. Gay incest is... just better. It doesn't have that downside. So go for it? I guess."
Elsanna,3e1rit,IndigoInWinter,3,Tue Jul 21 08:30:06 2015 UTC,"the moral issue with incest comes from the detriment to the health of offspring   Actually, barring any pre-existing conditions, the development of deformities/mutations/etc. only crops up after multiple generations (around four or five or more) of inbreeding, not from one hookup.  Statistically, the odds of a healthy brother and sister, or pair of cousins, or whatever, with no family history of genetic disorders, producing offspring with a significant mutation or deformity, compared to the odds of that same thing occuring between two completely-unrelated individuals with no family histories of genetic disorders, all in a single generation, is less than 2% in the most generous estimation of probability."
Elsanna,3e1rit,ChaosWolf1982,2,Tue Jul 21 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"That's still enough to feel uncomfortable about it, I'd say. 1 in 50 is not the kind of odds you want to gamble the life of a child on."
Elsanna,3e1rit,MattheJ1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"Re-read what I said there.   less than 2% in the most generous estimation of probability   Meaning that's on the far outside of likelyhood under optimal conditions, such as the developing fetus not simply having a natural miscarrying in the first trimester.  In reality, the odds are less than even a fraction of a single percent, roughly on par with Downs Syndrome coming to full term."

Elsanna,3e1rit,RunAwayWoods,8,Wed Jul 22 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"As indigo said, as long as no one is forced, it is OK    The other moral issue with incest is for parents forcing children, this does not happen in sisterly incest, so...    i know cousins IRL that are together and is like ""ah ok"""
Elsanna,3e1rit,Darthvaderisnotme,2,Tue Jul 21 08:54:54 2015 UTC,"i know cousins IRL that are together and is like ""ah ok""   Cool. I know a woman, she's in a polyamorous relationship with her brother and his girlfriend, they're nudists, and have two kids. Well, one kid is the brother's (and everyone they know thinks it's from donor sperm, since nobody knows about their relationship) and the other is a kid from her previous relationship with an abusive dickbag, and whose abuse is suspected to be the reason that kid has developmental issues.

Elsanna,3e1rit,MikuxLuka401,9,Tue Jul 21 11:01:14 2015 UTC,"As much as I'm sicken by incest between real people (and can feel myself throw up in my mouth just trying to imagine it with my own siblings or other family members), I must say that incest is not wrong as long as it's between 2 consenting adults.  However, we must also be aware that incest in real life is most often NOT between consenting people, or adults for that matter. It's not a coincidence that the most prevalent form of incest IRL is father-daughter and older brother-younger sister. The power dynamic is toxic and not equal. It's predatory rather than true love. The male/older partners have the influence and intimidation over a person who is depended on them and can't escape the house.   True love cannot occur between 2 unequal people. Think about teacher/student or doctor/patient relationship. These types of relationship are frown upon by society and punishable by employers at work even though they're not incest. The reason is because relationships where one holds power over the other is very, very, very easily prone to abuse. Which lead us back to incest: parents will always have certain power over their children, and older sibling over their younger ones (even if everyone is financally independent, which is not always the case). The vulnerable parties can be coerced into the relationship due to fear of losing family, or being brained-washed by the predatory family member that they cannot find real love because ""blood is thicker than water"", etc. You might think nobody is dumb enough to be brain-washed into commiting incest, but it's real and very prevalent. Just like people who keep being tricked/coerced into staying with their abusive spouses.  One more thing why incest is frown upon beside the ""deformed children"" and ""abuse"" reason: if the romance doesn't work out, 99% chances are you will lose that family member. Family members are supposed to love each other unconditionally, romance tends to fuck that up really bad.  Tl;dr: Incest is not wrong as long as it's between 2 consenting adults. But that condition is very hard to achieve in real life. Elsa x Anna IRL is only acceptable because we already know that Elsa would never take advantage of Anna."
Elsanna,3e1rit,Liamgrbd,4,Tue Jul 21 09:48:11 2015 UTC,"However, we must also be aware that incest in real life is most often NOT between consenting people   Do they? The problem is, how would we even know? It might as well be that 0.5% to 2% of the adult population is living in elsanna-esque arrangements, but obviously they wouldn't be telling anyone about it.   A few decades ago, it was taken for granted that homosexuality goes hand in hand with pedophilia, because the only times you heard about it were when someone got caught raping a child. The same applis to incest as well, in a way. If it's consensual, you are much less likely to hear about it.    True love cannot occur between 2 unequal people. Think about teacher/student or doctor/patient relationship. These types of relationship are frown upon by society and punishable by employers at work even though they're not incest.    They can be punished for not living up to higher professional standards, but otherwise, inequality happens everywhere and we accept that it can't always be regulated.  There can be inequality between a younger and an older adult, between a rich and a poor person, or between a healthy and a physically disabled one, or between a native and an immigrant, or between a working man and a housewife. We still accept that anyone who is sound of mind, and could sign a contract, is also responsible enough to handle the inevitable inequalities of a relationship."
Elsanna,3e1rit,Genoscythe_,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"Do they? The problem is, how would we even know?   There are plenty cases of consensual adult incest that got under public light. You must understand it's not a simple case of ""if we don't tell, nobody will know."" These people have family/relatives/friends who they cannot hide from. ""Let's go somewhere no one knows who we are"" is extremely difficult IRL. Note that the majority cases of incest, including the pedophilia ones (=statutory rape), are shed light upon mostly through friends' and family's report, not by the victims seeking help nor the perpetrators confessing. So there is no proof that consensual incest is better hidden or whatsover, while there is a very strong evidence that nonconsensual ones are more prevalent.  And yes, most people who know any incest going around them will report it to the authority. Because it is a crime with jail sentence in most part of the world, not merely a social taboo.   They can be punished for not living up to higher professional standards, but otherwise, inequality happens everywhere and we accept that it can't always be regulated.    I think you're misunderstanding something here. Love does not have to be literally ""absolutely equal."" Most couples will always have differences in age, income, experience, race, gender, physical capabilities, etc. in varying degrees. It does not mean they are not equal. In contrast, the inequality between a teacher/student, doctor/patient, parent/child, etc. is that the superior partner in these relationship hold a direct authority over the other: a teacher can fail the student's grades, the doctor can hinder the patient's recovery, the parent can neglect the child. Society forbids these kinds of relationship in order to protect the vulnerable party. If we don't forbid them altogether, there's no way to tell whether e.g. a student who failed his grade was because of a petty revenge from the teacher, or if the student falsely accussed the teacher to shift the blame of his terrible grades."

To which it still holds true, that it's significantly easier to notice an abused child's erratic behavior, than to out two consenting adults, who would need to be caught en flagrante, because otherwise they would obviously intelligently cooperate in cover stories, knowing what they are risking.   Again, just take into account the above analogy about homosexuality, and compare the number of convicted sodomites in the Deep South a month before Lawrence v. Texas, to the number of open gay couples a month after it.    Most couples will always have differences in age, income, experience, race, gender, physical capabilities, etc. in varying degrees. It does not mean they are not equal. In contrast, the inequality between a teacher/student, doctor/patient, parent/child, etc. is that the superior partner in these relationship hold a direct authority over the other   This makes sense regarding an adult parent and an underage child, where there is a legal authority, but between two adults, control is more comparable to my examples that you wrote off as not real inequality, than to yours. It's all informal, more based on traditional roles, than legal control."

I'd have to say it's situational. Irl I have no problem with it as long as it is between to consenting adults (and some more criteria are met). The problem is that there are many incestuous relationships between people who shouldn't be having them, such as a father and a daughter.   Now for the criteria I mentioned earlier: the ability, or lack there of, to have children. For example if cousins or siblings have a child there is a high risk that it will have some form of genetic... issue. I would be much more inclined to accept an incestuous relationship if the people involved were of the same sex, for they would not be able to have children. I don't feel like I could trust some people not to have children if they really shouldn't..."

The problem with Scarf above is that it is not so much the talent in story telling that hits you, but the unexpected twist at the end.

It also gives us some hope of ElsAnna but that's even more of an absurd idea of Elsa marrying Olaf...   I hope Frozen 2 focuses on Elsa and Anna, not Sven or Olaf. Those two seriously need to die already. If the focus isn't on Elsa or Anna, then god dammit it better be freaking Elsa because her 30 minute run time in Frozen was not enough.   Here's a YouTube video of Santino (dude who voirced Hans) saying that Hans might make a return in Frozen 2 to be redeemed."

Anna and Kristoff are together, Olaf and Sven can be butt buddies, Elsa and Hans, they're alone...  If Santino is right and that Hans will get redeemed, it'll have to come from Elsa. Not Anna, not Kristoff, Sven or Olaf, but Elsa. She was Hans's main target so it has to be her. If Disney wants Elsa to have a love interest, only person I could think of is Hans. Either that or they keep Elsa single.   That's all just speculation so please don't hurt me. Hail ElsAnna, the OTP."
Elsanna,3dcpnq,Eireal,3,Wed Jul 15 07:22:00 2015 UTC,"TBH, I think they'd make a new character before using Hans if they insisted on giving Elsa a love interest, and I'd take anything his voice actor said all the way back in June with a grain of salt--the writers easily could have changed their minds by now, and/or he could be engaging in some wishful thinking.  IMO it's a question of both ""space"" and who's the actual target audience for this movie. Kristanna works for Disney's purposes because it can be kept as a low-burn background relationship while the story focuses on Elsa-Anna, and because Kristoff himself doesn't need much spotlight or character development, he can just be this pleasant dude who's dating(/engaged to???) Anna.   But Hans? Like, I suppose you can do a ""redemption by death"" sort of deal and keep it within parameters, but if you're rehabilitating him to be ELSA'S endgame love? He'd end up taking over the entire story. Which is something I've seen happen probably dozens of times in television, but Frozen has a very different intended audience, who doesn't care about seeing Hans redeemed for a romance, as well as every reason in the world to keep the Elsa-Anna relationship front and center.  EDIT: Also, Elsa may have been his target, but Anna was the one he hurt far more intimately. And he relished hurting her. So IMO, forgiveness/redemption would have to come from both of them. Though I suppose it works out the same anyway, since I don't believe Elsa would even consider forgiving Hans unless Anna had wholeheartedly done so first."

It's the sort of trick writers pull in their public statements all the time, and it's way more in keeping with the way they used Hans in the first film than actually reforming him, this time taking on the ""facile redemption of the hot bad boy"" cliche rather than love at first with the perfect handsome prince."
Elsanna,3dcpnq,IndigoInWinter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:45:26 2015 UTC,I hope your hunch is right about them not getting married. Why do want Sven and Olaf to die?? They are funny!!! I hear you on Elsa though she defiantly needs more film time.

Elsanna,3dcpnq,IndigoInWinter,2,Thu Jul 16 01:02:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I know I stuck at it. I'll work on my sarcasm. :)
Elsanna,3dcpnq,IndigoInWinter,3,Thu Jul 16 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"Olaf as a love interest for... what the hell? Please no. I'm going to assume this is baseless speculation for now.  If they're going to explore homosexual themes, I would be really disappointed if they didn't involve Elsa. As far as realistic expectations go, I can tolerate them moving forward with Anna and Kristoff's relationship if they don't just throw a male love interest together for Elsa. And god, Olaf?  Let It Go is already great as a coming out song. Elsa should totally get to slam the closet door."
Elsanna,3dcpnq,cynthash,2,Wed Jul 15 09:29:41 2015 UTC,Oaken x his unnamed husband?
Elsanna,3dcpnq,TeleVue,3,Wed Jul 15 09:39:31 2015 UTC,"I suppose they could just make it an Oaken-and-family subplot. But with true love winning out all over, I really think it should be a major character. There should be a gay Disney princess. And it shouldn't just be ""let's make a new movie with a new princess specifically designed to be identifiable for a demographic."" It should be with a princess that makes sense. And I think Elsa makes sense."
Elsanna,3dcpnq,cynthash,2,Thu Jul 16 04:20:56 2015 UTC,Forgot about them. Is that guy really his husband and not some long distance cousin of Oaken's. I always though he was like Oaken's brother or cousin.
Elsanna,3dcpnq,cynthash,2,Wed Jul 15 10:56:20 2015 UTC,I defiantly see your point. Ok so realistically speaking how far do you think they should/will go with Anna and Kristoff's relationship? As far as Olaf goes.... yeah I don't think that will happen.
Elsanna,3dcpnq,cynthash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:16:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't want to see the wedding. Unless they set Frozen 2 significantly further in time than I expect. But even then.  If they're going to pursue the relationship between Anna and Kristoff further, I want to see it develop. I want both Disney and the characters to put the work into the relationship and have me really believe it. As far as Disney pairings go, Anna x Kristoff is actually pretty good, possibly one of the best, it's just not Elsa x Anna, which is the best.  As far as should, I mean, if the Elsanna community is lucrative enough, they should try to remain neutral, and pander to as much of the Frozen fan-base as possible, without stepping on any toes. Give us something so well-crafted and ambiguous that the shippers of every flavor can see it in their favor. That would make everyone happy, and make Disney the most money. This would be incredibly difficult though.  As far as will? I have no idea. If they handle the ""homosexual themes"" well, they'll be able to get away with a lot (not just with Anna and Kristoff) because that will be the point of controversy. If they handle it poorly, then they won't be able to get away with anything. Which means they might ending up playing it too safe. :/"
Elsanna,3dcpnq,Jessy1818,2,Thu Jul 16 04:17:14 2015 UTC,"I defiantly agree that if they go through with such a thing as Kristanna then they really need to make it more believable, but overall elsanna is the best. We will just have to wait and see what Disney will do overall."
Elsanna,3dcpnq,cynthash,3,Thu Jul 16 05:10:43 2015 UTC,"speculations  gives no sources  Anna and his iceman love interest   I... I wasn't aware that I wasn't a woman. Maybe something got lost in translation? I don't know how you misinterpret ""Princess"" or ""sister"", though. :P   Olaf is rumoured to be Queen Elsa's love interest   ಠ_ಠ   Moana   I can't help but snort and giggle like a teenager whenever I see the name. :P"
Elsanna,3dcpnq,Vesfarhloc,4,Wed Jul 15 06:52:51 2015 UTC,Moana  MoAnna  More Anna   that's how I read it sometimes.
Elsanna,3dcpnq,mpsantiago,6,Wed Jul 15 06:57:30 2015 UTC,"""Moan for your sister, Anna."" <3"
Elsanna,3dcpnq,mpsantiago,2,Wed Jul 15 07:01:56 2015 UTC,-.- so your saying this article is all just speculations? I can see your point about Olaf. Why does Moana make you laugh? ..... wait never mind i think I got the joke.
Elsanna,3dcpnq,cynthash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:01:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she moans so much, that someone made it her name. XD And yes, I'm saying that the article is baseless speculation. And Olaf is ugly, and Elsie deserves more."
Elsanna,3dcpnq,LibraryLass,2,Wed Jul 15 07:03:26 2015 UTC,"Uggghh now every time I hear the name ""Moana"" I think of someone moaning. >.< True the article does't give any resources as to wether it is legit so we may be safe for now. (crosses fingers for no kristanna wedding). Olaf is not ugly he is just shaped weird. XD"
Elsanna,3dcpnq,LibraryLass,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:07:18 2015 UTC,"So a gay girl and a straight girl are arguing about a guy's looks... oh wait, this isn't the jokes sub... XDDDD But yes. Until it's actually Disney saying it, it's not happening. Or Jen Lee. Or Chris Buck."
