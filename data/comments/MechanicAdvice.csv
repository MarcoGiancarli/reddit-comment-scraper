MechanicAdvice,3e4vga,PM_For_Help,6,Tue Jul 21 23:46:03 2015 UTC,"Most stores have their own brand of tools. Years ago, I would have recommended craftsman, but I'm sorry to hear that the quality has gone to crap (rumor has it, they're trying to bring back quality).   The tools I can't recommend enough come off a tool truck. They tend to cost up to four times what you can find in any store, but the quality can't be matched.   To be a hobby mechanic, I would recommend a Haynes or Chilton book for your car (the actual book is easier to use imo offer any software). You'll need a good selection of sockets, combo open/closed end wrenches, quality screw drivers, Allen/torx sockets, a few ratchets ¼, ½,¾"" and a socket set for each, both shallow and deep. A OBD2 scanner will let you read codes.   A small compressor for checking and filling tires and dusting out stuff comes in really handy. A floor jack (don't spend less than a hundred dollars, avoid bottle jacks, look for lift height no less than from your elbow to your hand, the best jack stands you can find, wheel chock, and use them all together. Don't worry about a creeper, instead use large cardboard boxes you break down. They're easy to slide around on, they're cheap or free with purchase*. They're disposable after they save your driveway from spills.   A good tool box, socket rails, wrench racks, and a system to keep it all organized, clean, & safe will make life much easier. Buy a large one with lots of shallow drawers and few large ones. This lets you stay organized without stacking tools.   You're looking at about a thousand to two thousand to really get started off right. Tools will be the limiting factor on what you can do.   Edit: I wasn't done yet!"

MechanicAdvice,3e4vga,MartinMan2213,2,Wed Jul 22 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"Try and get a Craftsman mechanics set, usually a 300some odd piece set, on Ebay. Look for the made in the USA sets, like these. Though try and find a kit with the raised panel non ratcheting wrenches, and get a set of Gearwrench ratcheting wrenches if you want ratcheting.  Sears now only has the made in China ones, and they are crapola. But there are still a bunch of boxed USA sets that distributors have, and you can find them on Ebay. I have a USA set that I use daily, and they work great. I also have a China set that's in a mobile box we use with our race car. It is utter garbage, but good enough for the rare trackside repair."

I really hope they didn't spend that much money if it's really not that good.  I'm in the market for a set of good ratcheting wrenches so I'll watch out for the made in China sets."
MechanicAdvice,3e4vga,MartinMan2213,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you're just wrenching on your own car on weekends, Craftsman is fine.  Mechanics rip on Chinese tools because they will not hold up to being used hard day after day, and a busy tech can't afford to have a tool break in the middle of the work day.  For someone just learning, especially if the tools were a gift, you'll do just fine with them."
MechanicAdvice,3e4vga,pirateofspace,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"The ratcheting mechanism on the 1/2"" ratchet in my Chinese set broke within the first few uses. The finish on the sockets is crap, and the relief holes in the sockets arent even centered on half of them. If you're going to spend that kind of money, and can't find a USA set, you're better off with Husky.  And I would never knock a tool just because it was made in China. I have quite a few Harbor Freight tools I use daily and they work great. I also have tried others that don't."

If you want something even more useful, check these out. They used to sold by SK, then EZ Red (which I have), and now ATD or Mountain. These are the first wrenches I grab daily. Extra long for better torque (though I wouldn't use them for super stuck fasteners), smooth action, flex head, and I love the spline drive.   EZ Red now sells a locking flex head version, though I haven't tried it, but my buddy has them and he loves them."

MechanicAdvice,3e4vga,JordanFox2,3,Wed Jul 22 00:09:45 2015 UTC,I like gearwrench stuff. The ratcheting mechanisms are smoother than the new craftsman stuff and seem to hold up better with what I have done with them. They also have a lifetime warranty so in the off chance that I break something I can just go to advance auto parts and exchange it. I have managed to break a few sockets and a pair of the ratcheting wrenches ( my own dumb fault to be honest) and have not had a single problem exchanging them even without a receipt.

MechanicAdvice,3e4vga,walkersm,3,Wed Jul 22 00:22:09 2015 UTC,If you are starting with the plugs the one specialty thing you will need is spark plug sockets.  They are a bit longer than usual and have some rubber in the base to grab and hold the plug in the socket.  Useful for trying to insert  it into the cylinder head at the end of the deep hole caused by the valve cover.   A basic mechanics set will have 2 spark plug sockets because there are really only 2 common sizes that cars use.   Sentra should be all bolts I do not think you will run into any TORX kind of fasteners.   But as you gt deeper into it you will run across the need for specialty tools for your car.  If none of the auto shops loan them out then consider investing in it if you are going to keep the car a while.  Can always sell them if you get a diffrent car and no longer have a need for them.  Someone is always looking for stuff.   Tool quality really comes into play when you are having to break loose stubborn bolts.  For common maintenance nothing you should have to undo will be more than 50 foot pounds torque so any socket set will do.  Just in case maybe try and find a brand that offers free replacement of any broken sockets for life.  think sears used to do that not sure any more.

GM are usually a fairly sized purple wire down at the starter solenoid next to where the bat cable connects. Have someone try to start the car and see if test light lights up. You may see this purple wire going down to the starter in the harness and you can probe it there. Make sure test light has a good ground end on battery and that it works.

I believe you can swap it with another one to see if the problem goes away or not.  It's incredibly hard to fix something when it works fine under your care, you may need to take it out to recreate the issue then bring it to them when it's happening.  Get them to agree to that in advance though.  When that starts cut off the a/c (unless you are on the way to the dealer).  Clicking on and off like that is hell on the clutch and compressor and I don't think the fan is going to like it much either long term."

The problem itself is very strange.  The fact that it does it only under certain conditions isn't that strange, it's beneficial to you even.  Likely something is heating up and failing.  If they know what to do to recreate it then they can...  they can have the lot boy go drive it up and down the road until the problem starts happening and then run back in to an open bay with it.   It's the ones that you happen intermittently that are a bitch to isolate and fix.  You have to report back and let us know what it turns out to be."

MechanicAdvice,3e4f33,walkersm,0,Tue Jul 21 21:53:28 2015 UTC,If the pressure is good then you may have a blockage somewhere.  First place to look is the Expansion valve or an orrifice tube if that system has one.

MechanicAdvice,3e4f33,Starkeshia,0,Tue Jul 21 21:58:37 2015 UTC,Usually small metal shavings and rubber seal particles from the compressor.  Very surprised you got 100K out of your compressor.  usually it is common practice to replace the compressor at the same time you replace a clutch.  Because if you have worn through the tough clutch material you most likely have some serious wear inside the compressor as well.   Some pics here of orrifice tubes: https://www.google.com/search?q=clogged+orifice+tube&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMIvqGMwp3txgIVw5SICh3DagfF&biw=1024&bih=655

MechanicAdvice,3e57ny,robstoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:10:14 2015 UTC,The TCC may unlock if you let off the gas so that may not mean anything. On most vehicles I would expect it would set a trouble code and quite likely turn on the check engine light if the TCC was not locking up properly. If you're concerned you could hook up an OBD-II scanner and check for trouble codes.
MechanicAdvice,3e47w9,Evan8r,3,Tue Jul 21 20:50:35 2015 UTC,If any of the large gauge power feed or ground wires are corroded it can cause problems getting the engine to crank. The wire might have a good enough connection for the 30-40 amps flowing while the engine is running but the connection is likely not enough for the 100+ amps needed to actually crank the engine so as soon as the starter solenoid engages and starts drawing current the voltage to the starter drops to near zero and you get nothing.
MechanicAdvice,3e47w9,DropTopGSX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"I replaced the engine to ground wire (looked like 12 gauge) with some extra wire from when I had to change the battery ground wire (4 gauge) and my car is now idling at 1k rpms instead of the about 750 it was at, so that appears to have been part of an issue.  Talked to my guys at Napa, they told me I'll need to replace the starter.  It was heat soaked."

MechanicAdvice,3e47w9,brygphilomena,3,Tue Jul 21 23:45:03 2015 UTC,This is a pretty common complaint with a failing starter.  The solenoid may be wearing out or the starter itself but they are replaced together most times (the new starter comes with a new solenoid already mounted).  If you get stuck with it you can just keep turning the key until it eventually starts or use something like a hammer to give the starter a few love taps and that will jar it back to life for a while.  Obviously neither of those are a permanent solution to the issue.
MechanicAdvice,3e3m5q,nub4321,7,Tue Jul 21 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"The water that is evaporating makes up half of the coolant and is the part that actually cools the engine. The other part, the anti-freeze, does just that, keeps the coolant from freezing below 0 degrees Celsius. Freezing coolant would swell up inside the engine and possibly break something. The radiator cap does to me sound like a plausible candidate for your issue. unless you're seeing the coolant come out your tailpipe or going into your oil (oil level might seem to have risen since the water goes to the bottom of the pan or the oil would look milky or white slimeyness) then I would just give the radiator cap a shot. Its definitely cheaper and more plausible. the dirt on the transmission though that i'm going to have to say sounds completely BOOOooooOOOoGus! hope this helps."
MechanicAdvice,3e3m5q,IMFletcher89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, though wow, 4 L of mixed coolant seems like a lot to be going through in a couple weeks.

MechanicAdvice,3e3m5q,Downtownpiglet,3,Tue Jul 21 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"The hot oil light comes on when the transmission fluid gets too hot. The trans fluid is cooled by running it thru the radiator. Mud on the trans won't cause it to overheat the fluid. I think you have a cooling system problem, possibly a bad radiator.   At my dad's shop this one jeep gave us fits, it was an 08 with the 3.8l. It was just loosing coolant but not overheating on the instrument gauge. Just everyday the customer had to add coolant. It turned out to be the coolant temperature sensor. It was reading wrong and not turning the fans on enough so the truck was overheating enough to loose coolant thru the cap. Took us a while to figure it out but once we changed the sensor it stopped loosing coolant. We drove the truck around until it was good and hot and then tested the temperature of the coolant, it was way too hot but the fans were not on, and the temp sensor read different then our test thermometer. Not saying that's your issue, but I would test the cooling system."
MechanicAdvice,3e3m5q,Downtownpiglet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"The fans are going constantly.  They never seem to drop down into low speed or off at any point.  Might be a clogged rad, seems odd at this few miles on it though.  So if the cap is loosing water, would I not see something at least around the cap that would indicate it losing something?  Or is it all strictly water vapour that comes out, no chance of glycol overflowing as well."
MechanicAdvice,3e3m5q,alecm858,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:44 2015 UTC,"Usually there would be a sign. If it's loosing coolant thru the cap it's because it's overheating and pressure lifted the cap beyond just allowing coolant to pass into the overflow. So coolant dumps out. Now, if it happens a small amount over a long freeway drive, it may dissipate so you don't see it.   I like to test the radiator by accessing the back if possible, and spray the whole thing with a hose while the car is running and hot. The water should evaporate immediately and completely. If you have damp patches, the radiator is clogged.  If the radiator tests good and the fans are working properly and the temperature is about ten degrees different between inlet and outlet rad hoses on your infrared tester, then next I would next want to test the cooling system for holding pressure. Look for leaks at the all hoses, around the head and at the heater core.   If there are no external leaks then next you can test the cooling system for hydrocarbons. We use a gas analyzer but you can get a cheap tool that just goes on the radiator in place of the cap and it tests for hydrocarbons indicating a head gasket leak."

Some cars have misfire counters that you can see in the Mode 6 data on an OBD-II scan tool to see if it's misfiring but not enough to set a code.

Find a tire calculator online and punch in the stock size, then go to www.tirerack.com and look for all terrains in a similar size. Slightly taller or wider might be ok, but I wouldnt go much larger than perhaps an inch tops wider or taller as it may hit the fender."

These cars have some sort of funky engine mount on the belt side that causes a vibration, but any engine / trans mount may cause a vibration.  This mount actually drops down or compress itself over the years which causes the engine to drop. It may not be actually broken but compressed to a point the engine has dropped slightly. The only way you could tell on some is to put both the old mount and a new one side by side and notice the height. Not saying it's your problem now, but it's pretty common. ck all mounts!  I would hate to find out that they reworked head and valve seats to try to solve this problem and it turns out to be a bad engine mount. Just saying, IF that's the same problem they tried to solve before.  Exhaust can also cause a vibration."
MechanicAdvice,3e4a2p,kw900,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:11 2015 UTC,yeah these first focuses are famous for vibrations. Id say teh first thing to do is check the engine mounts and pull the plugs for inspection
MechanicAdvice,3e4a2p,MechMeister,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:20 2015 UTC,When I had the valve seats reworked it was because the car wasn't starting at all. Would this (potential) engine mount issue been obvious when they were working on the engine?

Have the dealer fix it.  Verify that the problem is fixed.  Then go back to him with the paperwork from the dealer and tell him you took it to the dealer as he suggested and they said the problem was the brake pads he used.  If he's an above board person and you have paperwork from the dealer stating his work caused the issue then he should reimburse whatever you spent at the dealer or whatever you paid him, whichever is less.

MechanicAdvice,3e2ysj,Thecatmilton,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"Well figure an engine itself isnt gonna be cheap and likely 100 or more dollars an hour.

I just priced out a chevy 6.0 vortec motor and it was 6k with my discount from chevy. There is no way a BMW engine from the dealer or a wholesaler is cheaper than that, Id expect it to be at least 7k or better.

MechanicAdvice,3e2rll,snufflepuff33,7,Tue Jul 21 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"Check your distributor bearing.  A real common issue on Hondas is that the distributor bearing is either wobbling, leaking oil into distributor and/or spreading around (conductive) red dust. Any/all of the above cause the issue. A new distributor will help, or to save money just the bearing can be replaced with some research for part number. Also if the o-ring leaks oil, same problem. Honda had recalls on that generation of Accord for bad dist bearings.  Are you sure valve cover is not leaking oil into spark plug wells? Also check the connections to the ignitor inside the distributor. Sometimes when someone puts the spade-lugs onto the ignitor they 'miss' and the ignitor lead is held on by the rubber boot. Similarly, if the ignitor is getting oil and/or oil vapors from bad bearing, that can cause issues.  another common issue is blocked EGR ports in the intake manifold. This causes multiple cylinder misfires.  http://www.acuraworld.com/forums/f40/diy-egr-intake-manifold-cleaning-68465/index2.html"

MechanicAdvice,3e2rll,IAMAJoel,3,Tue Jul 21 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"This all sounds like tight valve clearances to me. You can check them really quick by reading the MAP sensor value at idle, but try to read it while it's idling ok, not misfiring. There are 3 wires on the MAP sensor. One is ground, one has 5 volts and the other one at idle should read .8-.9 volts. If it's reading 1 volt or over, your valves are too tight. An adjustment should make the car idle nice and smooth again."
MechanicAdvice,3e2rll,Downtownpiglet,3,Tue Jul 21 15:45:25 2015 UTC,Agreed. I always do a valve adjustment on a Honda with multiple misfire codes. I'm surprised his mechanic didn't do this a while ago.

Another option would be to take the car to another mechanic, even a dealer, for diagnosis.  You can then use their diagnosis to decide if it's something you want them to fix, your first mechanic to fix or something you can take on yourself.

Generally the rule is <0.015 A is acceptable.    That is the Engine wiring diagram, the interior wiring would be a separate diagram. But basically, when you remove the 10A radio fuse take note if the clock turns off.   In which case a) pull the fuse when you park  b) get a new radio  c) perform radio surgery and just disable the clock (if you can, i don't know if it's the same display for the FM.)  d) leave it alone if the draw is within spec"

Namely, check the ground for the stalk and the relay and each socket. And also ohm out the sockets to see if one of them is shorted.   If the stalk was bad you wouldn't be getting the dash lights working.

MechanicAdvice,3e4j2z,KyleDComic,2,Tue Jul 21 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming this is on a Vulcan OHV since the DOHC ones rarely fail. You can do this job with a standard metric socket set and a ratchet, a serpentine belt tool (removal required, inspect condition and replace if its cracked or flaking apart in your hand, but either way, you NEED the tool, trust me), tools to drain the cooling system (the radiator has a stop cock on the bottom driver's side that makes this pretty simple, but you'll obviously need replacement coolant and a pan to drain into). You'll also need to remove the coolant degas/overflow bottle and connecting hoses, as well as part of the alternator support (you don't have to disconnect it, just move it out of the way) to gain sufficient clearance. Consider flushing the cooling system when you're done, because failing to change the coolant is likely what caused the pump impellers to rot. Vulcans are notorious for sludging up if you don't change the coolant in regular intervals (2 years is a good rule of thumb for standard green coolant, 3 for the official motorcraft gold).  It's also worth inspecting the timing cover as they are known to leak coolant if the cooling system has seen neglect. A dribble today will be a steady leak eventually. The timing cover is a lot more complicated to remove, however. Oil pan removal (and thus rear exhaust manifold removal) is required. Doing it without a cheater bar or an impact gun will be pretty miserable.   I just checked on the exact sockets you need. You need 8,10, and 13mm sockets, and a Torx T50 for the tensioner on top of the pump."

You will pretty much cry if you try to put one back on without it. Also, if the timing cover doesn't have any wet spots, the car is likely good to go for a long time.

MechanicAdvice,3e38ys,Aubiek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:02 2015 UTC,All looks fairly normal to me - the fine shavings may just be some initial wear or casting flash or something like that.

MechanicAdvice,3e38ys,biggsteve81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"Is this something that they can just reverse and fix, or would this have caused damage to the rotor that they should also be fixing?"
MechanicAdvice,3e38ys,biggsteve81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:39 2015 UTC,"It looks like the rotor has been scratched or gouged somewhat; I would have them replace the rotor and pads on that wheel.  After all, they screwed it up, not you."
MechanicAdvice,3e38vp,bossycat,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"Well, it all depends on your situation.  As it sits around here, it would be a $500 car, tops.  maybe $750 if it was low mileage, etc.    Assuming its mostly/all body damage, that's fairly repairable if you DIY it.  You could easily find a parts car in a junkyard and strip everything you need for $200-$300.  Else, if you want to pay someone else to fix it, its probably not worth it from a financial standpoint."
MechanicAdvice,3e38vp,UserReeducationTool,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:31 2015 UTC,I think there's more than just body damage. The radiator is for sure done for and there is probably engine damage. The towing company offered $300 for it. Could I haggle for more?
MechanicAdvice,3e38vp,InfoSecGeek,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"$300 is low. The car is worth about $1500 in running condition, but I would say ask for $900 and settle for $750."
MechanicAdvice,3e38vp,N0Ultimatum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"A radiator isn't too expensive.   Edit : you can do most of the repairs. If it's your only car, get it street legal, then get it pretty later. Fix radiator and headlights and then rear bumper then paint imo. Most difficult part will be rear quarter panel."
MechanicAdvice,3e38vp,N0Ultimatum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:31 2015 UTC,The mechanic says they can't do any work until the body is taken care of first. My options are:   tow the car back to my home which will cost me $220 and then have it looked at by my usual mechanic (more trustworthy). sell the car to an auction for $300 (or haggle for more?) do the repairs myself (I have no experience with mechanical work)   The mechanic made it sound like there could be a lot of damage inside. Something about the AC lines being messed up. The headlight is interfering with the steering mechanism as well.   Do you think they're trying to squeeze me out of my money? Or are they being trustworthy.
MechanicAdvice,3e38vp,irowiki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Anyone should be able to install some headlights (even you can) and the radiator? It should be plug and play. I mean, I looked up some pics of the radiator and I can't even tell how it would have been damaged. But even if you do need a new one, the mounting points should still be good. I would personally just fix it little by little. I looked at the rear again and it's just ugly. Your taillight is damaged, but not enough to get you pulled over. Also a engine bay pic would be nice. Let us know. I would personally get a friend to slowly tow it home for you. After that literally look up forums and/or youtube for radiator replacement. It's super easy. Just basic tools."

MechanicAdvice,3e1i5g,mmmmaaarrk,2,Tue Jul 21 06:08:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's useless.  It keeps crap from getting into the valve cover (ie bugs, dust).  From the factory, most cars feed the crankcase and/or valve cover breathers back into the intake.  This can actually gunk up the intake throttle body and plenum, but it's ""good for the environment"".    A common modification is to just vent this through a little filter like yours, sometimes with a catch-can in between."

MechanicAdvice,3e1i5g,Qlanger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:39:21 2015 UTC,Yea its a aftermarket filter usually used as a crankcase filter. Some use them to bypass the original hose that comes off the air filter box when a aftermarket air filter is installed.
MechanicAdvice,3e1i5g,akthunder73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:07 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's a crankcase vent filter. Keeps oil gunk from gumming up the intake tract. Just a heads up, if you have state vehicle inspections/smog, there's a chance the shop will fail it, the factory hose is supposed to route back into the intake so it can burn off the fumes rather than just venting it out. Before my city abolished emissions testing I had an oil catch can in line on that hose and they failed me, stupid but whatever. If you plan on using it, keep the stock hose just incase."

MechanicAdvice,3e0vyy,jfastman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:43 2015 UTC,"Oil changes are complicated. Unless you're sending them off to blackstone to have them analyzed, you don't really know what the intervals should be. Even if you do, your driving patterns could change (long trip? got a new job with a shorter commute? Summer autocross season? etc.).   That being said, the intervals are recommendations based on average driving habits, with a bit of a safety margin built in.   Me, personally, I'm running a mix of 2 different types of oil for very specific reasons. Using a 10,000 mile interval. When I send mine in, it usually comes back as having another 5,000 miles of life left in it. (But I beat the piss out of my car, so I keep it at 10k for the safety margin)  But. Every car is different. Every driver is different. Oil technology (additive technology) is advancing every year. There are oils out there claiming 15,000 mile intervals (I find those to be dubious at best, but it's possible).   What I'm saying is that if you don't know anything about oil or cars, just keep changing at the manufacturer recommended intervals, with the MFG recommended oil. Read your manual."
MechanicAdvice,3e0vyy,madbuilder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"You raise good points here.  All else equal, I would say a long trip puts ""better miles"" on your oil than a bunch of short ones.  That's assuming your cooling system is in decent shape.

MechanicAdvice,3e1gzp,walkersm,4,Tue Jul 21 05:52:37 2015 UTC,"Since it did not suck any coolant into the radiator from the overflow tank I would suspect your radiator cap is faulty.

MechanicAdvice,3e1gzp,walkersm,3,Tue Jul 21 06:31:47 2015 UTC,Your radiator has to be full or close to full for the overflow to work properly.  You can replace the radiator cap but it's likely fine.    With the empty overflow and low radiator you know you have a leak.  Keep both full but your priority here should be finding and repairing the leak.

MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,brac24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:50 2015 UTC,Yea thats actually the inertia switch I was talking about and thats the one we bypassed in order to eliminate it as a possible problem. But even before that switch the voltage is super low. It should go up to 12 volts for like 2 seconds just to prime the car but it doesnt
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:04:41 2015 UTC,did you click the red tiny envelope above right.. for your copy of the wiring diagram .. ? for that circuit.   how are the contacts in the fuel pump relay. were you able to look at them..   print a copy of this test... http://i.imgur.com/WMDprhm.jpg   since the engine won't run.. i need you to perform test 5.. positive battery to the various fuses.. but i want you to check it to both side of fuse F1.12 while you are squeezing the fuel pump relay..   it may not work if the fuel pump module is not requesting power.
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:14:07 2015 UTC,Yes I did thank you. Yea earlier we took a look at the relay and it looks fine. The thing is that I cant get to the fuel pump relay unless I disassemble the fuse box because its soldered on to a board and sandwiched inside the box
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,kw900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:09 2015 UTC,oh... see i don't see these often.. you might have a bad solder joint or need to use a solder sucker to assist you in removing the circuit board mounted relay..  this is a solder sucker.. http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/ssr-1/solder-sucker/1.html  you can also use solder wick. http://www.allelectronics.com/index.php?page=seek&id[m]=pattern&id[q]=wick  i will have to dig into the fuse box .. got pictures posted to imgur..??
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:52:29 2015 UTC,"On this truck, it should remain 12 volts before inertia switch when the key on. The FPDM controls the fuel pump along with PCM."
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,2,Tue Jul 21 07:06:20 2015 UTC,"fuse F1.12 feeds the fuel pump relay contacts.. that feeds the inertia switch..  the inertia switch feeds pin 5 on the fuel pump driver module..  so key on relay pinched to close the contacts for testing.. you should have power on pin 5 at the fuel pump driver module..  probably a white wire but i am only looking at the wiring diagram you got pm'd.   pin 3 is a ground at G403 location.. i recall that those had an issue with corrosion also.  as did the fuel pump driver module. is this one up above something in the rear of the truck..  where it gets caked with mud..  pins 2 and 4 power the fuel pump..  Pin 2 has Ground, Pin 4 has positive.. so you should be able to identify those.. they will be a shielded pair of wires.. perhaps even twisted.. pin 4 wire positive is PINK/black stripe.  PIN 2 wire negative is BROWN/orange.   don't forget that this electric fuel pump is variable speed controlled  you can power it up directly to test it.. but it will probably have too much fuel pressure to operate the engine without screwing stuff up..   i don't know where the fuel pump inertia switch is in that model.. i rarely work on newer ford pickups. . vans yes.. pickups.. no.   do you still have your owners manual?? it may give the location in cryptic code of where the inertia switch is.."
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:27:09 2015 UTC,Yea the white one coming from the inertia switch is the one I checked and I'm getting .1 to .2 volts and thats it. The line going to the inertia switch is also at .2 volts so fuel pump drive module is getting no power. The inertia switch is already bypassed so its not even in the circuit anymore it just goes straight to the pump module. It could possibly be a ground issue but I'm not sure how to go about solving that. And yes it at the rear of the truck but the module is brand new. My aunt still had the old fuel pump laying around and we tested it by connecting it straight to a battery and it worked perfectly.
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:25:05 2015 UTC,throw a jumper cable under the truck...  laying on the floor.. you can hook up just the positive at the front of the truck to the positive battery.. and where you bypassed the inertia switch.. you can plug in there.. with extreme care so you don't short anything to ground.. this should power the fuel pump driver module so you can see if the truck will start..   the wiring to the inertia switch comes from the fuel pump relay output.. if you are only getting minimal voltage there.. you could have a bad wire or a bad connection all the way to the front of the truck..
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,kw900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:07 2015 UTC,I dont have pictures of the relay but see this video https://youtu.be/JjnlWO4ciFg?t=4m24s it is exactly like that. I will try the jumper wire and see if that works. So I should connect the positive of the battery to the white wire from the inertia switch to power the pump module right?
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,kw900,2,Tue Jul 21 06:59:33 2015 UTC,i have to find the coil voltage. solder in relays are replaceable. . you just have to solder them in..  http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/category/500250/relays/pc-mount/1.html  now.. since we are soldering.. why not drill a hole in the side of the box.. thread in a conventional relay pigtail.. http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/srly-2/socket-for-automotive-relay/1.html  solder it to the proper terminals on the circuit board.. and use a conventional relay externally..   i would probably also use some solder wick looped around or extend the  bare copper wire from the relay pigtail and solder it down to the power in and the power out traces.  that would make this retrofit far better...  the only thing.. i need to find an relay catalog to identify that exact relay configuration.  if it has a diode or not..  what the coil voltage spec is..  and what the resistance is.. what ever controls the coil pull in must not be over worked..  do you have this handled.. ?? i can go farther.. but its 1 am here and i have been up for 19 hours.. things are starting to get blurry.

MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,kw900,2,Tue Jul 21 07:54:52 2015 UTC,i was just looking at the OMRON catalog.. that is a failure prone application.. if that relay is only 8Amps as shown on the image in the video.. that is overloaded and designed to fail..  so you have a few options going to the external relay on a pigtail.. or using a separate power feed back to the inertia switch.. where you can install a LOAD dropping relay back there.  so the 8 amps is never exceeded.. thru the relay.. and the fuel pump driver module gets more current.. with a plug and play installation..  with minimal cut wires at the back of the truck .. that all depends if there is power there to supply it..  and i don't know.. that will take me hours..   this looks like a fun project.. are you in los angeles.. where i can come over with my experience and soldering equipment and a dremmel and fix your fuse box for you .. or you bring it to me..  i don't want to get into shipping. its only a drive that i am willing to do..

MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,rhekn,3,Tue Jul 21 08:20:50 2015 UTC,Any Codes? F1.12 - 15 amp fuse in CJB F1.28 - 5 amp fuse in CJB PCM Power Diode not burnt out? F1.5 - 7.5 amp fuse - PCM POWER F1.30 - 25 amp fuse - PCM POWER  What volts does C411 DG/YE have when key-on? It is somewhere in-between the CJB and Inertia switch.  C270b at CJB black wire should have 0 volts with key on since it grounds at G101.
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:00:42 2015 UTC,C411 stays at .2 volts. I dont know if I'm measuring it correctly I'm probing it then just attaching it to a ground on the car that should give me the proper reading correct?
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,2,Tue Jul 21 10:19:08 2015 UTC,"Should, did you test that damn volt meter to make sure fuse is not blown? A working power probe tool with volt meter and connect it to battery is the best way to test. The Power Probe has long leads, but you can test with dvom if it works and you sure you got good ground. hard to get a ground on this truck!  Next step would be the wire where it comes out the CJB. DG/YE at C270k connector and where that DG/YE comes out of CJB. If no voltage there I'm calling it a bad CJB, ground, or bad built in fuel pump relay, you may can bypass it with an external relay since it's just a 12v feed to inertia switch. Makes sure you checked that diode and all those fuses I mentioned, then check all other fuses. Might have to pull that CJB out, it's in a hell of a spot, but test that wire where it comes out first. In fact, I take a power probe and shoot the juice to that wire and see if everything works. Be sure you got correct circuit though. That circuit not controlled by pcm, it suppose to work when ignition key on, if my wiring diagram is correct :-\  C270b BLack wire has to have a ground! Should have no voltage on this wire with key on. Make sure truck battery has not gone dead. There is one other thing that you need to test. IF fuse and good diode has power it is likely the CJB ignition feed or power relay has power since the wire in question splits off from circuit before power relay, but that CJB is not a simple circuit. You need to have all power in checked."
MechanicAdvice,3e1ewa,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"Ok se we ended up just connecting straight to a battery at the shutoff valve point to test the module and the pump and it turned right on. When I had checked the DG/YE wire coming out of the CJB I would get about .3 volts. Decided to check it one more time and got about 2 volts max and started going down. Tried it one last time and when we cycled the key to on it magically just when up to 12 volts. Surprised, I told my dad to hurry and turn it on as I felt this was going to be a one time thing. Sure enough it started up and even got to reading up to 14 volts at that line let it run for a while. Turned it off and on again and it worked again. Did one more time and was no longer the 12 to 14 volts it was back down to a very low voltage"

MechanicAdvice,3e0qr5,08b,7,Tue Jul 21 02:08:31 2015 UTC,It will be fine on regular 87 octane.
MechanicAdvice,3e0qr5,CJM8515,3,Tue Jul 21 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"Just use regular (87).    The numbers behind gasoline - 87-89-92 indicate the octane rating of the fuel.  Simply put, the octane rating indicates how much compression the fuel can withstand before it spontaneously combusts. If you have a high compression engine, you will need to use higher octane fuel.  Your Hyundai does not need premium fuel because the engine uses a ""normal"" level of compression.    TL;DR - Use regular fuel.  Your engine was designed for it and using premium is simply a waste of money."
MechanicAdvice,3e0qr5,MilwaukeeMechanic,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:49 2015 UTC,"Almost every car in past what 25 years or more has a knock sensor and computer controls that set the timing. CJM8515 is correct, regular unleaded is probably best and since it's the fastest seller it's also fresh. You don't want no 6 month old gasoline. I rarely see anyone buy the premium anymore. To take advantage of a higher octane which slows down the burning process you need a higher compression engine. Hyundai is a low compression engine."
MechanicAdvice,3e0qr5,kw900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"If you ever go to some place that is high in elevation where regular gasoline is 85 octane, you could even get away with that i bet. Octane ratings are a measure of how explosive the gas is. It doesn't really have anything to do with the quality of the gasoline you put in your car. There are a few gas stations, shell comes to mind, where they claim their premium fuel is not only a higher octane, but a better quality due to the extra additives they put in the gasoline. I wouldn't put anything other than regular in your particular car, however."

MechanicAdvice,3e0nja,CJM8515,3,Tue Jul 21 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"Try putting a block of wood in the caliper to stop the moving piston and see if the other comes out. With no resistance it might just be the one piston is a little freer than the other. If the piston still doesn't come out then replace the caliper. Also, make sure all the slides are clean and lubed on both calipers, you may just have a stuck slide.   Calipers are relatively cheap, I'd replace both if it was my truck. If you can, get loaded calipers for it. They come with new brake pads, slides, and brackets."

MechanicAdvice,3e0nja,rsuss01,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:14 2015 UTC,Replace the calipers and brake hoses. The hose has a collapsed internal wall and the caliper is sticking. It will eventually pump up but it's not going to be fixed until you replace those parts.

MechanicAdvice,3e0dip,thepowerofjeww,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:27:07 2015 UTC,"Is that measurement of the Rotor thickness or the pad thickness, as far as pads go new pads for small vehicles should be around 10mm and minimum thickness around 2-3 mm before I replace them.   Now as far as the price goes, from a dealership that's not bad, but sounds like a Rotor resurface is in the cost too at my dealership (Honda) we charge 180 for pads, Rotor resurface, and lubricating the caliper slide pins. That's parts and labor."
MechanicAdvice,3e0dip,thepowerofjeww,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"He said it doesn't include rotor resurfacing because they don't do that at the dealership and I'm assuming he meant pad thickness.  It doesn't squeak all the time, I just knew I was getting close and they happened to mention it while the car was in for other repairs under warranty."
MechanicAdvice,3e0dip,3sheetsdiesel,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"Then that's a little high, it is a little more expensive car than a Honda which is my specialty, but it sounds about right for dealership cost, roughly 60-70 for pads and about 1.2 hrs for labor, so around 120-130 in labor. After shop fees around 200+taxes. It's not horrible but it's a dealership and an independent shop can do it cheaper and may be able to resurface the rotors as well for around the same cost, you can also get the pads and bring them to an independent shop so you're still getting OE quality pads and getting labor a bit cheaper. I'd recommend staying with the dealer but it's also good practice to get the rotors resurfaced when replacing pads to get rid of any warpage in the rotors."
MechanicAdvice,3e0dip,MrCleanPCB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:16 2015 UTC,The ABS module needed replacing (under warranty) and put up the replace brakes symbol (in addition to all the other dash lights as well as making my car stall in reverse).  My brakes do squeak in the mornings but I think that's from dust accumulation and I just got carried away and asked them if the brakes were low and they probably jumped at the opportunity to do an early replacement. Going to wait a bit on the brakes.  Thanks! :)
MechanicAdvice,3e0dip,MrCleanPCB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, that squeak could be caused by rust on your rotors, very common after it rains, and nothing can be done to prevent it, and the only real fix is to drive it and hit the brakes hard a few times."

MechanicAdvice,3dzs7v,antiiiklutch,4,Mon Jul 20 21:20:02 2015 UTC,For things like brakes that are kind of a commodity item - I don't think you would have any problem going with aftermarket.
MechanicAdvice,3dzs7v,UserReeducationTool,4,Mon Jul 20 21:23:53 2015 UTC,IMHO aftermarket brake parts are as good as or better than what came on the car unless you buy the cheap / no name stuff and even that's decent.  Stay away from the white box stuff (no name / generic white box) and don't get the cheapest pads.  Get the mid level or better yet get the ceramic from a name brand manufacturer.  When it comes to electrical parts like sensors I try to go with a factory part.  Starters and alternators I go with something new if I can.  Rebuilt only if it's extremely easy to swap out as they fail early and often.

MechanicAdvice,3dzjqi,UserReeducationTool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:13:07 2015 UTC,"Why is $1000 for the parts and labor absurd in your mind?  Is the other shop willing to work with customer-supplied parts?  Some are, some aren't.  Keep in mind too that if there's a failure under warranty on those struts, you'll be paying for the labor to remove & replace them, whereas generally if a shop supplies the parts they will cover the labor to R&R them.  Something to be aware of...  If you want to buy the struts yourself, go to RockAuto.com, pick your car from the list (Honda, Civic, 2002, 1.7) and go to the Suspension -> Strut / Coil Mount / Spring assembly heading.  You might as well buy the all in one unit - since you can't evaluate the old parts you have to see how good they are.  From there, the descriptions will tell you the position (front left, front right, etc.) and which trim package.    Generally you get what you pay for with parts - the economy parts may work, but won't be up to original specs or last as long as a top-quality part.  Many times the 'real' OEM parts are the best bet that you buy from a dealer, but sometimes the aftermarket parts are just as good or better.    Personally with something like suspension parts, I would go with the best I can afford on a car I care to keep.  Its a job where labor is the biggest part, so it would be foolish to try to save a few bucks on the parts only to have to rip it all apart and redo it if things failed early."

MechanicAdvice,3e0dwn,overallprettyaverage,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"The default answer is no, it is not safe to drive.  If you have it inspected by a real person in a decent shop that says otherwise then you can drive it but without seeing the car all anyone can do is make a random guess.    If the body shop can get the parts you need salvage then you can save some money.  Get an estimate on what it will take to repair it and a also ask what it would take just to make it safe again."
MechanicAdvice,3e0dwn,imprl59,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:37:20 2015 UTC,Depends on what is actually damaged.
MechanicAdvice,3e13oz,ngjonathan91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:26 2015 UTC,is the oil leaking or the pump frozen up? what are your symptoms?
MechanicAdvice,3e13oz,donkey90745,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:42:18 2015 UTC,"Well I took it to a mechanic and they said it was a failure of something and a bunch of metal pieces went inside the compressor. I have to replace it, they wanted to charge me a shit ton. So I decided to buy the part and have a buddy put it in for me.  EDIT: They wanted to charge me a shit-ton just to put replace it. that's all they were gonna do, from what i understood."
MechanicAdvice,3e13oz,eskansm9442,2,Tue Jul 21 11:44:39 2015 UTC,"You can't just replace an a/c compressor. It's not just a remove and replace part. The refrigerant in the system also has to be recovered and replaced in the right amounts. You're probably seeing charges for the compressor, the refrigerant, and then labor to do those things."
MechanicAdvice,3e13oz,imprl59,2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:31 2015 UTC,That's not all they were going to do.   The system has to be evacuated first then thoroughly flushed to get those bits of metal out of the condenser and all the lines.  The expansion device may need to be replaced if it's clogged (that's where all the bits end up eventually) and the dryer.  The the system needs to be vacuumed and refilled with oil and refrigerant.  If you know what you're doing and have access to the tools it's a doable job but if you skip steps you end up with either a system that doesn't work at best or replacing the compressor again and starting over at worst.
MechanicAdvice,3e13oz,scillycharybdis,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:57 2015 UTC,"Did you even try a parts store?   http://www.autozone.com/cooling-heating-and-climate-control/a-c-compressor/mercedes-benz/ml320-4wd/2002/6-cylinders-3-2l-mfi?filterByKeyWord=compressor&fromString=search  I'm sure other parts stores have it, as well as a dealership if you are picky."

MechanicAdvice,3e13jc,AllNine,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"If you don't feel comfortable paying why did you tell him to diagnose it?  The problem here is that he makes a living off diagnosing and fixing cars. You needed your car fixed, he said he would charge you X to diagnose it.  You agreed.  Now that the car is fixed, nice and dandy, you think he charges too much.  Except you are pretty clear he said ahead of time what he charged.  BTW, I work with Jeep/Dodge/Chrysler parts and yes, the CPK(Crank) sensor on the 4.7 Cherokee goes out ALOT. Like, we sells them by the hundreds every month.  If you tought his labor was too expensive, you should have told him BEFORE he worked. Not after he fixed your car.  PS: This happens to alot of good mechanics, if you had spent the last 3 weeks taking your car from one place to another to find a problem, you would not have a problem paying him 160 to fix it, instead, since he found the problem right away, he doesnt deserve 160...think about it.  I also agree that the charge is a bit high, but thats how free market works. He can charge you what he wants, as long as its up front. You are the one who needs to accept or decline, before he does the work. Not change your mind AFTER it.  Do you throw up after you get the bill in a restaurant so you don't have to pay?"
MechanicAdvice,3e13jc,NaiveMind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:46 2015 UTC,I totally get what you're saying. It was never my intention to NOT pay because I know I agreed to all of it. I'm mostly asking because I didn't realize that this might be high until after I had agreed and want to know for myself what kind of deal this is. This is essentially my first time taking a car into a shop to get fixed. I did reply to another comment left with more details explaining how I ended up in this situation. Thanks for your reply!
MechanicAdvice,3e13jc,imprl59,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:23 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you but the time to decide you didn't want to pay the price was before the work was done, not after.  Not to be rude but how you feel doesn't have anything to do with the facts.  The man told you how much the diagnosis was going to cost, you agreed to it, he performed the work and now you don't want to pay for it.    Not being able to diagnose a bad crank sensor on a Jeep is strange but they can fail in strange ways. It could be that the vehicle was running when it got there so it took extra time to get it to fail again so they could figure out what was wrong.  Not sure why they won't break down the bill on paper but it sounds like you already know the breakdown.  I don't have any facts here so I can't really say if he's just a dummy or if it was a difficult diagnosis.  Gut feeling is I probably wouldn't use him again.  Also if a car comes in to the shop and it was something easy, say a bad piece of vacuum hose or a bad gas cap many shops would just fix it and not charge any additional labor above the diagnostic fee. In your case the crank position sensor isn't a horrible job but it takes time and that time has to be billed. The mechanic gets paid based off billable hours so if he gives away $300 in billable diagnosis time because you decided to spend $100 on billable repair time he isn't going to be in business very long."
MechanicAdvice,3e13jc,imprl59,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:12 2015 UTC,"Hi and thanks for your reply!  I get what you're saying and I want to make it clear that I'm not intending to go to him, complain and demand that I not pay for the work that I agreed to. I will say that I did feel really pressured and rushed by the shop guy to sign papers and get things going really fast. I also felt like I was stuck at that place because towing it to a new place would cost more and probably just offset any savings I might be getting at a new shop. And again to be clear, I know that those are factors that I felt and I made a choice based on that.  I really just want to understand if this is all on the high end, if it's excessive, and a general opinion on what the shop was telling me. Even though I knew that I was going to end up paying the bill, I don't like the thought of walking in clueless. (I have VERY little experience dealing with auto shops.) It wasn't until after I had signed stuff with this shop that I was alerted to the fact that it might be high. I had two other shops call me back (a full day or so after I originally called) and give me their run down which basically said that diagnostic fees would be taken off if I fixed the issue at their shop. I have read some things online where they say that even though you are not being billed for a diagnostic fee, in reality you are still paying it because they will often just add some more time onto the job itself. I don't know if that's true or not and I'm sure different shops have their own policies about it.  Anyway, I've talked to him again on the phone since I first posted and again, when I asked him how much time was spent on the car the only answer I could get out of him was, ""two days."" I don't like that at all, I would hope that they would keep track of actual hours and then be willing to give the customer that information. But I'm going back to get the car today. I'm going to just pay and I'll just have to be more careful next time. Thanks again for your reply!"
MechanicAdvice,3e13jc,UserReeducationTool,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"This is where this guy is falling down on the job in my opinion and why I wouldn't use him again.  You shouldn't be here right now wondering why the additional diagnostic time was needed and if it's fair.   When he called he should have explained exactly why it was going to take more time.    Unfortunately good mechanics are often not so good with customers and people good with customers often aren't so good at working on cars.  Right brain / left brain kind of thing.   This is why you have a service advisor at dealerships.  The service advisor takes the ten minute story from you and the ten minutes of time it takes to make you feel warm and fuzzy and translates that down to two sentences on a work order for the mechanic.   The mechanic diagnoses it and responds back with two sentences and the service writer expounds on that to make a nice pretty work order to keep the warm and fuzzies flowing then upsells you on some maintenance service you didn't really need but he makes $10 from if he sells it to you.    Speaking for me personally I would be embarrassed to charge you additional diagnostic time for a crank sensor on a Jeep.  It's one of those things that you just know...  they all fail.   Perhaps there was additional time needed but you win some you lose some as far as diagnostic time goes.    As for charging adiagnostic fee..  Everyone has their gimmick.  Shop A charges a diagnostic fee.  Shop B rolls the fee in to the repair but they charge more per hour.  Shop C rolls the fee in to the repair but they mark up all the parts 120%.  It tends to be the chain shops that offer the free diagnostics and you know their expenses are higher than Joe's Mechanic Shop so you know they are making it up somewhere.   No such thing as a free lunch as my dear sweet granny used to say.  Again, just my opinion, but the diagnostic fee and then labor / parts to fix the problem are acceptable.  The second diagnostic fee is not acceptable / questionable but we have no facts to back that up.  Here's some general advice that might help in the future:  Find a decent independent mechanic and build a relationship with them.  Have all your work done there, get your oil changed there when you can.  A repeat customer is worth more than gold to a good shop and knowing you have  a trustworthy place to send the vehicle when you are broken down on the side of a 120degree hwy is worth a lot to you.  Get a AAA membership or some other motor club.  I've been a member more years than I'll admit and don't think there has ever been a year that I didn't use it.  Out of gas, flat tire, need a tow, locked the keys in the car, whatever goes wrong.  They'll get you back to your mechanic or to a AAA approved shop which might not be much but it's a little better than being forced to pick a place while broken down on the side of the road."
MechanicAdvice,3e13jc,UserReeducationTool,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem right to me either (the extra diagnostic fee) but you agreed to pay it, so in my mind you need to.  If you felt like you were being taken advantage of, why didn't you get it taken to another shop?    As far as calculating labor, its usually 'by the book'.  There are guides published that list a certain number of hours for a job on a specific vehicle.  The lack of transparency though would bother me - that's definitely not a place I would re-visit."
MechanicAdvice,3e12qa,jnewyork23,2,Tue Jul 21 03:30:58 2015 UTC,please don't buy a Ford Escape.

MechanicAdvice,3e12qa,TomSawyer83,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"I had an '03 that was a total piece of shit.  oil pan, wheel bearings, shift linkage, paint peeling... from my own experience (I also had a Mustang) and from what I see other people experience (paint peeling, shoddy parts, even on newer models - both my dad's F150 and a friend's Fiesta) I would never buy another Ford.  You're getting a good deal because it's a Ford Escape.  That's why it's cheap.  They have no resale value. Edit: honestly I'm biased, I just hate Fords.  Do your own research I guess.  The Edmunds overall rating for the '09 looks o.k.   - actually I forgot to mention electrical problems and the cigarette light used to shoot right out of the socket, hot. I was thinking about taking it up to the highway, lighting it on fire, and saying the cigarette lighter caused it."
MechanicAdvice,3e12qa,tmac3954,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:07 2015 UTC,Have an '04 Escape...Can confirm having all the same problems as mentioned above.  Probably gonna have to ghost ride it into a lake
MechanicAdvice,3e12qa,imprl59,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"Its hard to tell anecdotally, I've heard the same about every car from the undeniably crappy Outlander to the very solid CR-V. Everyone seems to have both good and bad experiences.  If a mechanic weighed in with a larger sample size that is something I'd consider. Also when buying a used car the lack of resale value is really a pretty good thing."
MechanicAdvice,3e12qa,imprl59,2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't worry me a bit.  Any number of things can cause an emissions failure.  It could be as simple as the battery having been discharged or disconnected a short time before the test.  Since it passed inspections afterward and at that low mileage I wouldn't worry at all.  Now I'll give you more things to worry about.... What kind of dealer is this?  If it's a new car dealers used lot I would get a factory (no, not a third party) extended warranty if it's available.  If it's at Joe's used car-a-rama and it's cheap then there is probably a reason it's there.  People love to trade in troubled vehicles to a new car dealer thinking they are slick because they stuck it to the dealer.  They aren't...  The dealer knows the car is turd sammich so they send it to auction where Joe buys it and sticks out front at the car-a-rama, along you come and the rest is potential history.  That's not saying every car at Joe's is no good.  I worked at a used car lot for a long time and we sold a lot of very good cars but do your homework..  Have the car inspected.  I would use an independent mechanic and see if the dealer has any service history on the vehicle.  If it's been in to their shop 20 times for transmission issues obviously you don't want that car."
MechanicAdvice,3e12qa,shaker_not_shaken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for your answer! This car is at a Honda dealer so they don't do Ford warranties I don't think. They do offer a lifetime powertrain warranty (which I think is through a third party) - is this a good thing or not? The car doesn't seem to have a ton of service history which is a bit worrisome but it's a very good deal. Will a new car dealer let me get the car inspected - is this something I Should do? Do you have any other thoughts?  Here's the car for reference.  http://www.bochhondawest.com/certified/Ford/2009-Ford-Escape-9de93c4e0a0a00de2156c8acfcf0fb4a.htm
MechanicAdvice,3e12qa,shaker_not_shaken,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:22 2015 UTC,"That's good news.  Most new car dealers have a reputation to protect so they won't knowingly put a bad car on their used lot.  It's probably already been inspected by their mechanics but they won't have any problem with you taking it somewhere else for an inspection.  If you seem to be on the up and up they may even let you take it on an ""extended test drive"" where you can drive it for a day and keep it overnight.    Most of those third party warranties are just shy of being worth less than the paper they are printed on.  They take forever to approve the repairs and then only do the absolute bare minimum to make it roll again.  It's better than nothing though, especially if it's included.  Not having a lot of service history isn't a bad thing.  That can just mean it wasn't a troublesome vehicle and didn't need much service.  I've never worked on this vehicle but my understanding is they do have some common issues.  I'm in much the same camp as you though, I'd rather pay less money for a car knowing that it may need a few more repairs over its life than spend all the money up front on a car that statistically needs less repairs.  Take good care of it, keep up with the maintenance and get problems fixed as soon as you notice them.  If you do those things you'll get a good long life out of practically anything made now."

MechanicAdvice,3e065m,imprl59,2,Mon Jul 20 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"A couple of things I've learned from my years on this planet:  Buy the best one you can afford.  It cost a lot more to fix something than to just buy it right to start with and with a 20 year old car there will be plenty of things to fix no matter which one you get.    When a seller says ""it just needs"" what that really means is they have no idea whats wrong with it, have spent all their money trying to fix it and have now given up and decided to sucker someone else with it.    Make sure the car has the options needed to sell it.  No matter how much you love it you are going to want to sell the car one day.  This is doubly true if you are looking for something to fix up.  It's just how we work, you fix it then it's all fixed and you're bored so you have to get another one and fix it again.  In this case the car has no a/c.  A car in FL with no a/c isn't going to sell.  This is also a good sign the car came from up north (which means rust).  No matter what don't buy a car from a salt area if you don't live in a salt area.  Our mechanics down here don't know how to deal with rusty parts...(I'm over toward Tampa)  Get a carfax and have any car inspected by a mechanic before you buy it.  For every one thing you see broken there are two more that you're going to miss.  Hopefully the mechanic will catch those things."

MechanicAdvice,3e039e,RollYourBoat,4,Mon Jul 20 22:41:42 2015 UTC,"The brake light does not come on because the fluid needs to be changed.  It comes on because the parking brake isn't released or the brake fluid level is low (indicating a need for service or a leak) or it comes on because there is a hydraulic problem with one of the circuits.    Stop driving the car until the issue is identified and repaired.  You don't want to have to deal with a dead brother because he drove on bad brakes in the car you bought him.  Hate to be harsh there but a vehicle having good brakes is a serious issue, especially for a new driver.  If you want to try bleeding the brakes you aren't going to hurt anything.

MechanicAdvice,3e039e,imprl59,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:34 2015 UTC,OK.   If the fluid is low it went somewhere.  If the pads are worn that could account for the fluid loss otherwise comb over the system to find that leak!  I could be having a foggy memory attack but I don't believe that car even has a hydraulic clutch.  It has a cable and no connection to the brakes whatsoever.  Even on cars that have a hydraulic clutch the clutch system is separate from the brakes although a few share a common reservoir.
MechanicAdvice,3dz514,Leknasant,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:29 2015 UTC,2 things.     at higher RPM are you also driving down the road?  AC systems work where heat transfer is needed if you're sitting idle you're probably at a stoplight and the heat it's removing from your car and putting into the condenser isn't being cooled as much as when you're driving and airflow is running over the condenser.     40psi on the low site but at what temperature is the outside air?  follow this chart to see what the PSI should be http://i.imgur.com/aXT5cDy.jpg at 40 PSI the outside temperature should be 75-80 degrees   has it suddenly become more humid in your area the last week? AC works harder when it has to remove more moisture from the air.  Think of it this way AC isn't cooling your cabin.  It's actually removing heat from your cabin and putting that heat into the condenser which is in front of your radiator.  it cools better the more air flowing over the condenser.  You might also want to check that when you're ac is on your fans are running up front pushing air over the condenser.    some cars like Hondas have really poor cooling capabilities when stopped.  i've never seen a honda AC system cool very well when the car is not moving.  I'm not sure if a Tiburon suffers the same fate.

MechanicAdvice,3e0nl6,kw900,0,Tue Jul 21 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"This is sort of normal operation on a steep incline, but I'm wondering if the guy replaced the transmission cooler or radiator when he had the trans rebuilt! Likely inside the radiator but some two cooler, on in the radiator (needs replacing) and one external for cooling. Not all have a the external one but either could become clogged. IF cooler is clogged some it will have lower hydraulic pressure and the trans works off hydraulic pressure. The torque converter should have also been replaced when rebuilding trans. The torque converter is what controls the stall speed, the rpms where the trans starts pulling.  If the idle speed (rpms) are too low it can make this problem more noticeable on hills. Also make sure your throttle is clean not sticking. I assume the trans is not slipping. A slipping trans the RPMS would increase but the truck would not move or move slower than it normally would. These are low powered engines though, on a steep incline hold brake, press accelerator a bit, and ease off brake and go, it should not roll back.  Low engine idle speed is the primary cause of rolling back on an incline, but on steep incline in some vehicles it is somewhat normal operation."
MechanicAdvice,3e0nl6,kw900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"It didn't seem like a normal slow idle roll back, I pushed the gas and hit ~3500 rpm without the car moving forward any more.

A lot of people have these removed, I don't know what the legalities of this are in your area, but basically you put a streight pipe in where the DPF is (some are made to look like a DPF...), then map the car so the computer knows the car has it removed and still runs correctly."

I would get the same engine that blew up, even if it's the four banger because it's going to be way easier for your first one.   We have ordered the junkyard engines from a nationwide recycler and they work fine. They come on a pallet and they are complete engines, sometimes you have to take off old wire harness stuff or fuel rails because they just cut stuff when they pull the motors.   So you pull out your engine and swap over the parts. You can take it out with the transmission attached or undo the tranny and leave it in. Which ever looks easiest. Keep all the nuts and bolts carefully sorted and labeled so you can get all the stuff, alternator, power steering, a/c, injectors, fuel lines, all that back on in reverse order. I stole all my moms church cupcake baking pan things for the motorcycle I just did. They kept all ten million little screws and nuts and things organized, and I also used a notebook which I kept track of every step when I took the thing apart.

I expect to pay 30% to 50% markup but they are over 100% on stuff.  I would get another estimate.  Use a highly rated independent mechanic, not a chain shop.    You could do the front brakes yourself.  Replace the pads and rotors.  I would have them do the rears unless you have someone to help you.  You can have them flush the brakes as well.  Belt should be done soon.  You can do that yourself if you can walk and chew gum at the same time.  If you did the belt and front brakes you could do the spark plugs.

This is to be expected then - sometimes you have to pay the piper and letting small problems go can cost more in the end.  As far as the items go they all seem like things that you should address to me for the most part.

For example: $228 is quoted for new brake rotors. On Amazon, you can find a new brake rotor pair along with new brake pads for each for less than $100. You're also quoted about $55 for a ""drive belt"" which I assume is the accessory serpentine belt. You can have that for roughly half cost elsewhere. Also, the labor charges are doled out with hour minimums. Some of these jobs take less than an hour for experienced mechanics and can occur in parallel.  I am also concerned over their repair choices. According to the price sheet one front axle has a ripped boot, and they recommend a repair kit for $30.32. Ripped axle boots often go undiscovered for extended periods, allowing road grit into the axle joint the boot covered. This eventually causes full joint failure to manifest. A new axle can be purchased with a core charge of about $50, and would constitute a far more robust repair installed with a similar labor time.  Get a second opinion, and ask all of your mechanics what their policy on 3rd party parts are."
MechanicAdvice,3dzpau,ImprezaDrezza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"Generally labor times are generated by a index and they could be buying better parts than what you're finding on Amazon..  But I definitely second (well, third) the get a second opinion  Personally, I think they're nickle and diming him... wipers? Really?  Op, when did you change your oil last? it being black means nothing.. I changed my oil and checked it a week or two later and it was pretty much black (though I'd neglected it before, picked up the nasty shit from before)  Spark plugs are very easy to do yourself..."

They arent using that quality of part and most mark up the part a good bit to make money for overhead. As for the axle seal, since its an HHR I cant recall but they may use a solid axle which means the seal could be replaced.  What type of shop did you go to? That looks like a firestone/midas type of bill"

Unlikely to be the suspension as it would have collapsed without it. That's a VW/AUDI it fell off of right?   Your best bet is to take the car to the dealership, bring them the bolt, and ask them where it belongs.   I say dealer and not independent this time because you want someone who sees the same model cars every day and will know where to look for that size bolt. If you have an independent shop who is particularly well versed in your model car then go there.   Should be very cheap/free, but that will depend of course on the shop.   Bear in mind, modern cars are designed differently that they used to be, a missing bolt in the right place can be a real problem. Do not drop it in the console and plan to ""get around to it"". Make plans to have it looked at as soon as you can."

That's about all you can do unless you get a mechanic to put a smoke machine on it or use a fancy scan tool to trigger the evap test manually.  As for the P0135, that's Oxygen O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1, Sensor 1). This will be the upstream O2 sensor (before the catalytic converter) on bank 1 (the one which has cylinder #1 on it, dunno which that is physically on this vehicle). The sensor likely has 4 wires on it, two of which are likely the same color which are the heater wires. You can measure the resistance on those wires on the sensor connector with a multimeter, it should be fairly low. If it's infinite resistance, the heater is burnt out and the sensor needs to be replaced. If not, could be a wiring problem in the heater circuit."

MechanicAdvice,3dxwq4,Starkeshia,3,Mon Jul 20 13:47:19 2015 UTC,"Check your paperwork and see if they replaced the condenser. When the compressor fails it usually spreads metal shavings through the system. shops often flush the system out, but the condenser insides are too small to be flushed, they just stay plugged. Replacing the condenser for the price of parts only seems very reasonable to me. Don't pay them again for any refrigerant, when they evacuate the system they recover the refrigerant (r1343a) and sell your own refrigerant back to you. No reason to let them do that on a warranty repair."
MechanicAdvice,3dxwq4,Pops__Racer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:20:38 2015 UTC,You probably have a leak in your system somewhere too. This could have caused your original compressor failure. If there is a leak it's most likely in the condenser since the car isn't too old and that part is most susceptible to damage.

MechanicAdvice,3dyjdr,SopranosFan,3,Mon Jul 20 16:05:17 2015 UTC,"If the timing belt broke, at minimum, it needs the head replaced/rebuilt. At worst it could need a whole engine. I assume this is a 1.8T? At minimum a head job will run you $3500-$4500 depending on the shop. If it needs an engine, you could go used. But 1.8t motors are still 2500 bucks.  As for what it is worth, If the car was perfect otherwise(also depending on the miles), maybe $1000. If it is a little rough, $500?  Look at it this way. If you fixed it for say $4k, would it be a nicer car than what you would buy with that 4k? I always see people do their math on what is ""worth"" fixing. It isn't just what the car is worth minus the cost of the repair. You have to take into account what you will spend to replace it and if that will be better/worse than what you currently have."

This would concern me greatly.  When this rusted piece of the strut tower finally gives away, the car will slam to the ground without warning.  If it happens while you are traveling at high speeds, it could be quite dangerous.    In my opinion, it probably is not worth fixing...  however, I really don't have any idea what a body shop would charge to repair it.  Stop by a body shop and get an estimate....  or maybe you could even email them this pic and get a ballpark idea of cost.    Good luck, be careful!"

Pull back the carpet and you'll have a better look from inside the trunk.  There are bigger structural bits still in good shape.    With that said, as noted, the only fix is welding more metal on there, and it's not cheap.  I'm running my car until the radiator falls off or the rear struts bust through.  Those are the two weak spots.  Front and rear bumper supports are bad too, but those are just bolted on and $100 brand new aftermarket.  Already did fuel tank, fuel lines, fuel filler, rear trailing arms, and brake lines.... The rest of the body and suspension is very good for a rust belt car.    So if you rely on the car and you've maintained the rest of it, it's worth it to fix.  If you havent already done the rest of the things I mentioned, this is just the start of a long expensive trip that will ultimately end at the junkyard.

Insert bolts into the threaded holes and when you tighten them evenly, they will press the sheave off the bushing.  Then you can remove the bushing and the sheave from the shaft.

MechanicAdvice,3dvhz4,MilwaukeeMechanic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:39 2015 UTC,There are normally 3 on the 4l60's when you spin on the torque converter and the last one is the pump so it could cause these issues. If you can unbolt the converter and try to spin it and push to see if it will engage another set of splines. The t case can also be in nuetral. If this is the E model there are shift solenoids on the valvebody in the pan so they may have issues since I have busted one once dropping a pan. They are $20 and pop in and out with a clip.

While the belt is off (engine off of course) you can check all pulleys, water pump, and the belt tensioner for noise by spinning it."
MechanicAdvice,3duozs,kw900,2,Sun Jul 19 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"Most likely it isnt specifically the PS. I think on that truck it just happens to be the second biggest one besides the crank. It also demands the most power to spin it (unless the alternator is on a short duty cycle). My guess is the tensioner is bad. Usually when you replace the belt on these engines, you want to replace the tensioner.   Do make sure the pulleys are all straight by looking side to side down the belt train.   Grab the belt when the engine is off, and tug on it. If you can move it more than an inch or so, the tensioner is bad."
MechanicAdvice,3duozs,pinky2252s,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:54:00 2015 UTC,Would the tensioner cause it to squeek on the right side of the engine if the tensioner is on the left side?
MechanicAdvice,3duozs,pinky2252s,2,Sun Jul 19 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"It affects the whole belt train when the tensioner is bad. It's what keeps the belt train tight on the pulleys.   Most likely, the PS pump or any belt train pulleys won't cause a squeak them selves. The way to test for that is too remove the belt and spin all the pulleys by hand (not the huge one at the bottom, you won't be able to turn that). See if one is harder to spin, or makes squeaking noises. If not, then I would replace the tensioner. They are only like 20 bucks for that I6, and it's only one bolt I'm pretty sure."
MechanicAdvice,3duozs,pinky2252s,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:58:55 2015 UTC,I changed the belt because it was like 5yrs old and had 80k on it at least. The belt slipped off after I got the water pump replaced back in November. And the belt wasn't functioning when I got slush on it in a storm last year.

Take off the belt, find the tensioner. If you have the new part, you should easily be able to tell which one is which. Then Im pretty sure its a 13mm or a 14mm and its one bolt in the middle of the body of the tensioner. Remove and replace, and re install the belt."

MechanicAdvice,3duozs,savagebunny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it doesn't hurt to try it your self first. Make sure you get a good t-40 socket. Dont buy a 7 dollar set with 10 sockets in it. As long as you have the torx socket all the way in, there isn't much else you can do too keep it from striping. It may help too get a longer(ish) breaker bar or ratchet so you have more leverage. a 12-18 inch breaker bar would work. Im a Mechanic, and I use Home Depot breaker bars with no problem.

MechanicAdvice,3dtqbb,lenoat702,13,Sun Jul 19 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"ATF is a hydraulic fluid, as is PS fluid. The big difference between PS fluid and ATF is trans fluid has detergents and friction modifiers. These detergents help keep gunk that may work its way into your power steering system from tearing apart your pump and the hyraulic valves inside the steering rack. The friction modifiers help control heat build up as the pump and valves operate (hydraulic systems make a lot of heat without being next to an internal combustion engine).  In my experience, cars that use ATF for power steering tend to have fewer power steering issues"
MechanicAdvice,3dtqbb,mechwarrior719,7,Sun Jul 19 12:38:17 2015 UTC,Why is there power steering fluid at all if ATF does a better job than PS?
MechanicAdvice,3dtqbb,Godzilla2y,7,Sun Jul 19 14:47:22 2015 UTC,That... Is an excellent question. Possibly because of hydraulic pressures. ATF tends to be a little more viscous than PS fluid. Or its just simply long term marketing. Ensuring that eventually the vehicle owner will have to either regularly change out PS fluid or replace the pump and/or rack; this is only speculation on my part however.
MechanicAdvice,3dtqbb,mechwarrior719,7,Sun Jul 19 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"I have never been able to find the data to prove it but I was told at my manufacturer's training center that due to the paraffin makeup, ps fluid has a higher ignition point than trans fluid.

Most power steering pumps use ATF, but some need specific power steering fluids because the pump may run something else as well. In my Grand Cherokee, my cooling fan is hydraulic. It needs a specific PS fluid, or else it's basically useless. Most of the time, it's just how the manufacturer designed the pump/rack/box and what they specifically want for it."

Here's the flasher location, mounted to the brake pedal, AC Delco part #D1703A.   You can test the flasher if you want to make sure that it's the culprit. If you have a some test leads and a test light you can pull the flasher off, supply power and ground from the battery, and use a test light to create a circuit outside of the car (not testing for any related wiring issues, ie a component test)  Otherwise testing it in the car would require taking plastic around steering column off, disconnecting the turnsignal/headlamp combination switch connector and completing the turn signal flashers circuit with a test lamp.  If you've got a test light handy I'll throw some pics on imgur with the disclaimer that you might break the plastic cover on the column,connectors etc if you try to diy on old plastic bits, and can damage the Body Control Module if you put the test light in the wrong cavity on the switch's connector when testing in car."

The starting do you hear the starter whir and not engage or no sound at all? For the ac a retro fit is no big deal but you need to find the leak since the oil needs to be swapped out for r134 and you need a machine to do that and most shops wont charge it with a known leak. Usually its the condensor (ac radiator in front of engine rad), compressor or evap core. Check to see if the condensor is rotted or damaged or if the compressor is wet from leaking oil out of the front behind the clutch.

You computer thinks that your catalytic converter is not doing it's job anymore.  It could be right, or the sensor could be faulty.  I don't know if this code would prevent the car from going in to ""Closed Loop"" mode.  This is where the computer is actively controlling air/fuel/spark for the best economy and performance.  If the car is in Open Loop mode, the computer is using a base set of operating parameters to keep the motor running.  Running in this mode will damage the vehicle over time as the engine is usually being run on the rich side.  It could be just the sensor if you've kept up on maintenance.  If you've been rolling around with the check engine light on for a long time, could be the catalytic converter."

Notice the caveat about economy wrenches--they don't hold their calibration long and most places won't recalibrate them. Consider them one-time use disposable.  http://www.familyhandyman.com/tools/automotive-tools/how-to-use-a-torque-wrench/print
MechanicAdvice,3dthpo,spaghettiJesus,3,Sun Jul 19 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"I thought of a fairly simple way to see if a torque wrench is somewhat close to calibration.   Put a bolt in a vise so that is is horizontal, or simply vise down on the head of the wrench. position the wrench on the bolt so that it is exactly level when you let go of it. Take a 25 lb dumbbell and attach to it a string of some kind, like twine.  You will be using this to apply a Force on the wrench at exactly 90 degrees by hanging it from the line on the handle of the wrench measure from the head of your torque wrench to the handle.  if it is exactly 1 foot from the ""line"" on the handle, set your torque wrench to 26 ft-lbs.  If the line is 2 feet, the torque you apply to the bolt will be double...  Torque= Length* sin(90)Force  Since we are applying the force at 90 degrees and sin(90) = 1 therefore T=L*F Lets assume we apply the force at 1 foot and we set the torque wrench to 26 ft-lbs, we then hang the weight gently at the 1 foot line on the wrench.  The wrench should not ""click"". Now lets set the torque wrench to 24 ft-lbs and hang the weight.  It should click this time. The indicates that your torque wrench is pretty close to calibrated.  You can also weigh the dumbbell to try to get more accurate results."
MechanicAdvice,3dthpo,n0exit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"That is incorrect. Where the line touches the center line is what you want to aim for.

MechanicAdvice,3dvoyf,tehdon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:02:47 2015 UTC,its knocking really bad does that automatically mean a road bearing?  If I put motor honey do you think I might could at least get a few more days out of it until it slings a rod?  (sorry I'm not that well versed on the inside of engines)
MechanicAdvice,3dvoyf,tehdon,2,Sun Jul 19 23:08:59 2015 UTC,If it sounds like this then you're already running on borrowed time.  There is literally nothing that can fix it or prolog it short of mechanical repairs.

MechanicAdvice,3dvgm6,3sheetsdiesel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:51 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your water pump is worn out, since you said the engine cools down when you rev it up.  Unfortunately, your water pump is driven by the timing belt, so you're going to want to get a timing belt kit with a water pump and replace all the idler pullies and the tensioner while you're under the timing cover replacing the water pump.  It's not a job for the faint-hearted, but it can be done in a driveway with hand tools.  Watch some YouTube videos on how to replace the timing belt on your car and see if it looks like something you'd want to try and tackle yourself.  Just be aware, that if you get your timing belt installed wrong, you'll bend valves which will warrant pulling the engine to pull the heads off."

If it's the old style with a belt driven fan clutch the clutches tend to go out after awhile and it needs to be replaced (just did this in my 4runner)  The water pump could also be worn out if it's really old  Either of those would explain why it cools off if you rev the engine up

MechanicAdvice,3dve4b,stevo_of_schnitzel,2,Sun Jul 19 21:06:24 2015 UTC,Check the coil pack. I've seen a lot of posters end up replacing those on Subarus. Spray it and the plug wires with a water bottle and see if there is any arcing or change in how the car runs. The jerking under load suggests an ignition component is failing.  The lean code could be an indicator. Check the air intake track between the mass air meter and throttle body. A small tear can cause lots of trouble on some vehicles.
MechanicAdvice,3dve4b,cptboring,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:35:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll check em after I get off work today. I did recently tape up a crack in the intake duct before the air filter. I'll check the rest of it also.
MechanicAdvice,3du0sa,Itseffingcold,3,Sun Jul 19 13:34:24 2015 UTC,"Caster is not adjustable on most vehicles. Less than a degree of cross shouldn't cause any noticeable effect on handling or tire wear.   Most of the time our customers won't pay for a full alignment in place of the adverted toe-n-go so I end up shipping lots of cars with excessive cross camber/caster angles. Most of the time they drive fine until you get up around 1.5 degrees of cross, then they drift or pull somewhat."
MechanicAdvice,3du0sa,cptboring,2,Sun Jul 19 14:21:28 2015 UTC,that is not enough to worry about.  some benz models used 10 degrees of caster.   positive caster is the upper pivot is farther back than the lower ball joint.  so the tires lean slightly into the turn.. but it also allows them to self center as the slight caster angle has an odd effect.. the leaning into the corner of the tires actually lifts that corner of the car slightly.. the weight of the car pushes back down and the wheels straighten out if you release the steering wheel..   camber is the leaning in or out at the top of the tires when they are pointed straight ahead..  the left tire usually in the old days had 1/4 degree more than the right to count for the crown in the roads.  what.. when riding a bicycle.. if you start to lean the bike one direction you will start to turn the way you lean..  since you will be driving on the right of the center of the crown on the road.. a little more camber on the left.. leaning out just a fraction more keeps the car from drifting toward the curbing on the right ..   this is just random info as i am an old school alignment guy with magnetic bubble gauges still.  but i have not used them in probably 10 years..   as long as both your numbers match. you will be fine..  if one side was negative and the other positive.. you would be in trouble.. and have a horrible handling car in most cases.
MechanicAdvice,3du0sa,waynep712222,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:55:35 2015 UTC,"All this information is correct, that explanation about caster and the reasoning for it is great. I am a current alignment guy, using the sensors put on the wheels and the computer calculated angles.  They may have different caster/camber settings to account for road crown. Often times front caster and camber adjustments require a kit or are not even possible."
MechanicAdvice,3du0sa,DHoShoe,3,Sun Jul 19 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"Um, guys, he said cross caster.  Meaning the difference from one side to the other has to be less than half a degree.  A car with only .5 degs of caster would be horrible to drive,  would require constant driver correction, and would need even more static negative camber.  Most FWD cars run less caster than RWD cars because it contributes to torque steer.  OP, I wouldn't worry about .6 degs of caster difference.  If you're looking for it you might notice it a little bit, but it won't hurt your tires.  If you're worried about it, a shop could probably get it within spec by loosening your front sub frame bolts a little, repositioning the sub frame, and tightening the bolts again.  You'll want to get the front realigned afterwards."

MechanicAdvice,3due58,Chinchillacious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:57:18 2015 UTC,Does the fan work in any speed? When the resistor fails usually high speed still works since no resistance is needed in the circuit. If all fan speeds don't work then it's a blower motor or fan switch issue.  To replace it all you need to do is remove the under dash panel on the passenger side and remove it from the HVAC case.

WHY.. because OBD2 cars keep some circuits active for up to 6 minutes after shut down.   i usually have a big battery cut off switch with test leads i can hook to my multimeter directly..  http://i.imgur.com/ksgo1gC.jpg  i don't have a picture of one other than that as i keep selling them to techs who see them.    with that set up.. install between the negative post and the negative battery cable end.. do not hook up your meter.. yet..  i use vacuum hose over the exposed banana plugs..  with the switch turned ON.. i get in. roll the window down.. start the engine .. let it run for a minute.. shut it off.. get out and lock the door in the normal fashion the owner does.. using a key or the keyfob.. ask them.  look at your watch.  in 7 minutes.. plug your tester into the banana plugs..  once your meter is hooked up into the 10 amp and common jacks.. turn the knob to disconnnect  the battery. this allows all the current to flow thru your meter and you will get an accurate parasitic draw test..  0.035 amps is kinda expected..  0.045 is a maybe.  with this switch hooked up.. you can easily go to the underhood fuse box and start pulling fuses ONE at a time to see if the current draw drops..   that is hard to do if you are holding the probes on the battery..

Use a trickle charger overnight to get the battery to a reasonable state of charge.  24 hours tends to be the best time frame to charge a battery fully.  And ALWAYS  take caution when the battery is nearly finished charging.   That is when the battery emits the most hydrogen gasses from the charging process.

Even better is the battery will not charge properly off a jump or a running car as it rapidly recharges. A charged designed for batteries slowly brings up the levels

MechanicAdvice,3dta4e,robotnyk,3,Sun Jul 19 06:17:16 2015 UTC,"Block could be cracked. I've seen hairline cracks you could barely see after cleaning the top of block off. Look like a little scratch, but it was a crack. On this truck it was why the headgasket kept leaking in the same spot!  I would also want to know if the van had any type of oil cooler which may leak coolant into the oil or oil into the coolant. note: I'm not a VW expert, they are not popular where I live in the U.S. In fact, I haven't seen a VW van since the old ones which has a Porsche engine and Weber carburetors. I do like the style of the newer VW vans though and have considered purchasing one. In American shops they turn their nose up to VW and other Euro cars, and add the fact that it's a diesel, few are qualified to even work on this car. Let us know what you find.  Perhaps a combustion leak test in in order using that blue liquid stuff and tool that looks like a huge eyedropper - says on bottle what to look for with a diesel or gasoline engine. I've seen people with smog machine test for hydrocarbons in the cooling system too, to check for combustion or headgasket leaks.  One thing's certain, if there is a problem it's gone get worse. Most diesels are high compression engines. Ck for any type of oil cooler first! With these vehicles, you got to know what the hell you doing. Was this shop a VW, diesel, or Euro specialty shop?"

I'm kind of a noob when it comes to cars so I won't be able to answer immediately, but I will relay the questions and information, especially about the oil cooler part. That sounds like a reasonable idea, and I haven't heard about that being checked.   As for the service, it was made in a Bosch certified place they're pretty well equipped by Hungarian small town standards."
MechanicAdvice,3dta4e,waynep712222,2,Sun Jul 19 13:40:40 2015 UTC,i have a quick test you might try with a COLD motor..  it sometimes shows issues up.  sandwich wrap.. very thin plastic film.. stretched across the radiator filler neck with the cap removed..  a depression pushed into the plastic..  DENT it .. use a rubber band to seal the plastic to the filler neck.  you may need to block the overflow ... you can squeeze a hose and verify the dent you have made puffs up...  start the engine for 15 seconds.. if the plastic puffs up .. you have a compression or combustion leak into the cooling system.   i have another test.. but i am not sure how you would perform it. on a diesel..  its a cylinder leak down test..  where you use compressed air to pump into the cylinders with each piston at the top of the compression stroke..  if the plastic film pops up when you apply air .. you have found the leak into the cooling system   i am also wondering if they changed the thermostat.. when an engine is overheated.. the thermostat can be damaged in an odd way.. there is a glob of wax in the copper part of the thermostat.. that expands when it reaches the operating temp. pushing the thermostat valve open..  this opens and closes many times a mile.  when overheated.. the wax can expand so far that it pushes past the rubber seal and then does not have enough to push the valve open against the closing spring.

MechanicAdvice,3dsq48,cptboring,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:46:53 2015 UTC,But if I were to twist the small nut it would still be twisting the cooling lines. It would warp them and probably cause them to snap. The bigger bolt is not a part of the radiator. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding you.
MechanicAdvice,3dsq48,cptboring,3,Sun Jul 19 02:51:10 2015 UTC,The small nut should spin around the line. It holds the flared end tight against the bigger nut.

MechanicAdvice,3dsbb8,donkey90745,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"Some of those GM cars will crank the alternator up or down based on the electrical voltage needed. Try turning on the highbeams and AC it should rise from 12.9v. My 2012 GMC Sierra does it, sometimes sits at 13v and then jumps to 14.9V. Usually turning it on and off it goes back to what I consider normal, 14v.  If that isnt the case, you need a multi meter and set it to 12V dc. Turn the car on, put the leadson the battery terminals. Should read 13.5v or better. Then turn on the fan on high and the highbeams, should stay pretty close to 13.5v or better. Rev engine and see, does it stay relatively the same? If not could very well be a failing alt, the voltage regulator is built in I dont think you can replace it on those."
MechanicAdvice,3dsbb8,donkey90745,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:18 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Sounds like your regulator is doing it's job and the alternator is keeping your battery charged ok. So don't worry about it.
MechanicAdvice,3dsaqt,major_lugo,4,Sat Jul 18 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"You've got an operator error on the gauges / adding refrigerant.  Assuming the system really is empty: In the 80's we had a sight glass and if you were over or under a half can on the refrigerant it wouldn't make any big difference.  On todays systems a few ozs are the difference between frosty cool and earth shattering kaboom.  This is why I always recommend people have the refrigerant reclaimed and then recharge the system by weight.  If it was cooling and you added a whole can you massively overcharged it.  The system only holds 15oz's total.  Since it went quickly there will be evidence wherever the leak is.  It likely blew out all the oil as well so it should be very easy to find.  To get it back up again you'll need to replace the failed part, replace the dryer, flush the system then vacuum and recharge with the proper amount of refrigerant and oil."

MechanicAdvice,3dsaqt,imprl59,6,Sun Jul 19 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't unfortunately.   First thing I would do in your position is find out if the system is really empty.  It's not legal to vent 134a on purpose so I won't suggest that you use a small screwdriver to push the pin in the port and see if it's actually empty or comes out with enthusiasm.  If it is actually empty the leak should be obvious to you because the refrigerant will have brought an ounce or more of oil out with it.  If it's not actually empty I would take it to a shop and have it evacuated and diagnosed.  I'm out of the game now and haven't worked on a Honda this new but on some of the fancier cars (Mercedes comes to mind) if the computer see's something it doesn't like it disables the a/c until the code is cleared.

Subaru's aren't very picky about parts luckily. I'd stick with NGK plugs, OEM wires, any waterpump and belt set you'd like to get. The drivebelts I've found to be slightly harder to install when theyre OEM (tiny bit smaller) but it doesn't matter since you have a manual tensioner"
MechanicAdvice,3dsjcv,swolemechanic,2,Sun Jul 19 01:50:45 2015 UTC,Gates makes OEM parts. So yes they are quite good. People do not like GMB (ebay) but I havent had bad luck with them.

I'm a bit skeptical of aftermarket thermostat quality at the moment, I would order factory on that.  Stay away from the bargain stuff you find on the internet.  A lot of that stuff just doesn't fit or doesn't hold up."
MechanicAdvice,3dsce1,sbgriffin,3,Sun Jul 19 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, the round metallic thing you have in your picture is the starter motor.  They're not terribly difficult to replace with hand tools, but if memory serves you'll have an easier time removing it from underneath.  It's been a while since I last replaced a starter motor on one of those cars.  Something you can do, before going through the hassle of taking it off the car and then getting a ride to {insert local auto parts store here}, take a hammer and tap on the starter, then have a helper try to start the car.  If it starts, you've got a dead spot in the starter somewhere.  That being the case, the starter should be replaced sooner rather than later.  If it doesn't start at all, it could absolutely be a dead starter, but there are other things it could be as well.  It may be the starter relay, or a poor electrical connection somewhere in the system.  The starter relay is in the under hood fuse block, and there is a diagram on the lid that will let you know which relay it is.  Easy way to test the relay is to pull it out and swap it out with a different relay from the same under hood fuse block.  Most of the relays are the same so swapping one of them is simply a plug-and-play affair.  If the car starts easily, that means that you've got a bad starter relay.  They are available at pretty much every parts store and they're not terribly expensive.  If it still doesn't start, then you know that your starter relay isn't the problem so it can go back into it's spot.  Checking the electrical connections requires the use of a volt meter, and the how-to of that is a little more complicated than I can explain here.  Just make sure that the wires are attached tightly to the starter and that the plug-in connector is still plugged all the way in.  Generally speaking, the wiring on Hondas is pretty bulletproof, so that's probably not the problem.  Most mechanics don't like it when you bring your own parts to their shop.  It's the same theory as bringing a steak to a restaurant and asking them to cook it for you.  If you make friends with a mechanic, you may be able to talk him or her into replacing the starter on the side for cash, but a lot of mechanics won't do it, at least most of the ones I know don't do side work."
MechanicAdvice,3dsce1,3sheetsdiesel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks SO much for such a detailed response. When I try the hammer trick, do I tap the small cylinder that the battery plug connects to, or the larger one right next to it? I assume one is the solenoid?  And can I tap it myself and then run and try to start, or do I need a helper to turn the ignition at the same instant I tap it?   I will try this in the morning and update. I will probably end up taking it to my mechanic, but if I can avoid dealing with a tow truck that right there will be a huge help.   I also appreciate the tip about bringing my own part. Just hate that they are charging me for service, and then making a huge profit off of me from the part as well."
MechanicAdvice,3dsce1,3sheetsdiesel,3,Sun Jul 19 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"Tap the large part that the starter solenoid is attached to.  It's possible to do it solo, but it's easier to have a helper.  Basically what's happening when you're tapping on it is you're causing the internal parts that normally rotate electrically to rotate slightly, which will potentially cause the dead spot to be in a position where it won't prevent the starter from working.  It's not going to resurrect a completely dead starter, but it may at least allow you to drive to a parts store/repair shop.  Glad I could be of assistance.  Hopefully it's a simple repair."
MechanicAdvice,3dsce1,lannvouivre,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"Tapped it and no luck. I am going to take the starter to an auto store to get checked out.  Is this all they need? When I removed it, the solenoid did not come off with it and is still attached to the motor. Am I supposed to bring the solenoid in with it or is what I have enough for them to test it?   From looking at this diagram, it looks like I might have removed the wrong two bolts and not taken enough out of it, and that the housing it was in, with the solenoid, is supposed to come out.   Edit: I'm guessing this picture shows the bolt I was supposed to remove?"
MechanicAdvice,3dsce1,3sheetsdiesel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:25:38 2015 UTC,"Hit it a bit harder.  I don't mean beat it like you want to dent it, but you need to give it a knock it can ""feel.""  When mine started failing, it needed more and more hitting (masochism at its finest) and was totally dead after 3 days.  Also, yes, that may be the bolt you need to remove.  There may be one more, where you can't see it.  I've never seen a starter come off in two pieces before..."
MechanicAdvice,3dsce1,3sheetsdiesel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:56:30 2015 UTC,"What you wound up doing is disassembling your starter motor.  The bolt in the last picture is the one you should have removed.  If memory serves both bolts that hold the starter to the engine are 17mm.  No real sense in getting your current starter motor tested now, since putting it back together is an exercise in frustration and is easy to screw up if you've got big fingers like I do.  A remanufactured/rebuilt starter shouldn't be terribly expensive, at least when compared to a new one.    With parts like starters and alternators I almost always opt for a remanufactured part rather than a new one from anywhere but the dealership.  Reason being, remanufactured parts are pretty much guaranteed to fit, as the part was installed on that engine when it was new once upon a time, it's just got new guts in it.  New, aftermarket parts are typically made to a pattern, and sometimes they don't fit as well as they could.  Reman stuff is cheaper too, but you've got to turn your old part in as a core so it can be rebuilt."

That was Sunday. As of an hour ago, they still don't know why it won't start and said they'd call me back tomorrow, but I'm not convinced they actually looked at it today."
MechanicAdvice,3dsce1,kw900,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  When they say it won't start, did they say if it was a ""no crank"" condition, or a ""crank, no start"" condition?.  There are 2 different diagnoses for those issues.  If it doesn't crank at all, I would first make sure that everything was correctly and completely hooked up.  Assuming that all the electrical connections are correct and secure, I'd make sure that the starter was actually getting a signal from the ignition switch.  Assuming that the starter is getting the signal from the ignition switch, and all the electrics are good, then I'd guess it was simply a case of getting a defective part.  It happens sometimes.  If it's a ""crank, no start"" condition, that's an entirely different diagnostic tree.  I'm not going to get into that diagnostic tree here, since it gets complicated and potentially isn't relevant to your issue."

MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,LOL_Wut_Axel,2,Sat Jul 18 23:00:40 2015 UTC,"Transmission could be low on oil or bad bearing in trans.  Clunk could be a bad strut (shock), or a loose bolt.  The big axle nut on the CV axles at wheel could be loose. Did he use an impact and make sure it's tight? They suppose to be pretty darn tight. Some have a big washer, others have washer on nut.  You can jounce on the car and check strut, and recheck ALL bolts under the car for tightness. I take mine to the shop and use a 3/8 impact to check all bolts when I have a noise.  When you sway the car back & forth while driving around 25-35 or when noise appears, does the grinding noise go away momentarily?"
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,kw900,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:43 2015 UTC,"I know for a fact the transmission is a bit low on gear oil.  When the CV axle was taken out around 1-1.5qt or so of gear oil came out with it.  After we did the CV axles we decided to put it back together before doing the engine/transmission mounts to see that it worked.  I put in around 75% of 1qt of gear oil in it before it started leaking out of the driver's cv axle and I know it takes 2qts, and it has around 1-1.5qts inside... probably closer to 1qt.  We decided to investigate the leak, and it turned out the lower engine mount was broken and the transmission could be moved a few inches with our hands.  We turned the car on and put it into 1st to get the wheels and axle spinning after tightening them and the axle was screeching a tiny bit and the transmission moving from side to side, and also a tiny bit more fluid came out as the axle was spinning.  It was turned on for around 5 seconds, I put it into neutral immediately and turned it off.  We then replaced the engine and transmission mount and did the same test and the small screeching the cv axle was doing had gone and the transmission was firmly in place and wouldn't move any too.  We didn't add any gear oil because we feared it would leak out again and we'd lose our $5-10 we put on of oil on it.  In the meantime, we thought ""it should run great now, let's take it off the jacks"".  My godfather was the one that tightened the cv axle nut, and he tightened it the absolute most it would go with the help of a pipe for leverage.  I tried taking it off and it was impossible, but he is a bit stronger than me so that's probably why.  That's definitely as tight as it'll go and he did use a manual impact wrench. The new CV axles use a 30mm washer; it's a washer-on-nut type.  I did jounce on the car and you can't really tell anything from it.  I made a video.  It's 3 mins long, and you can hear the clonks throughout.  Can't hear the grinding, though.  https://youtu.be/DhqHA3qe48w  I did check all the bolts throughout today: the strut, sway bar, tie rod end, ball joint, brake calipers.  It was all very tight.  My godfather is a mechanic and he helped me check it was all tight on the ones I did.  He's done an engine swap by himself on his 1994 Toyota 4Runner as well as worked on many cars and worked for Ford as a mechanic around 6 years ago, so I trust him.  The grinding noise... when you're between 1000-3000RPM it's very bad, particularly when accelerating, and when it's 3000-redline it dies down.  It is missing some gear oil... I will buy one more qt of Pennzoil Synchromesh tomorrow and see what happens.  That stuff is magic for the $9 it costs per qt... used it on various cars and the shifting is silky smooth.  I did sway back and forth... it made the grinding a bit more pronounced when accelerating and it died down a bit when decelerating, but after 3000RPM it starts to die down the higher you go in RPM.  When the noise/clunking appears, the grinding does not go away momentarily.  Thanks so, so much for taking the time to reply!  Clunking I think could possibly be the strut, and I forgot about the gear oil so thanks for pointing that out.  If the differential/axle isn't getting lubricated enough I imagine that could cause some grinding.  It does not grind at all going through the gears, though."
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,Azaron83,2,Sun Jul 19 05:14:45 2015 UTC,"Great reply sounds like your doing it correctly, however for the mtx75 transmission only use the ford $15 transmission fluid from the dealer.

That's not really possible unless it starts corroding the synchronizers... which even on the crappiest gear oil from what I know shouldn't happen until around 30K miles from having it in and you'd notice the effects right away in the form of notchy shifting and grinding going through the gears.  Pennzoil Synchromesh is good stuff; much better than the OEM at least in terms of shifting.  Seen it being used all the way from 400WHP+ Evos down to normal cars like Civics and Corollas.  I very much doubt it'd make anything fail.  All its job is, is to lubricate the gears and prevent corrosion.  Ever since the clutch job it has had Synchromesh in it and what came out of it in the differential looked basically brand new with no flecks of metal or anything and it always shifted silky smooth."
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,Azaron83,2,Sun Jul 19 13:16:13 2015 UTC,Like I said it was what I was told by a guy that builds these things all day long. Lol I have no opinion on it really.  Quick question is this left or right hand drive?
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,Azaron83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but remember some people do things simply because that's what they've learned to do.  Maybe he used some other gear oil and it did ruin the synchros... that doesn't mean you can only use one type.  The Pennzoil Synchromesh was in the car up to now for 40K miles and it came out looking like new.  Shifting was noticeably better than the OEM one, too, particularly from 1st to 3rd gear.  It's left hand drive as I am in Puerto Rico.  The roads here are awful."
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,Azaron83,2,Sun Jul 19 13:32:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  When in the air there isn't any slack in the tire? Left right. Or up down? If your getting grinding that serious then you should be able to see metal rubbing on something or be able to feel something loose.....  I'm slightly at my limit of ideas here. Unless you got bad parts, I don't believe anything was installed wrong. And the only other point of failure I can think of would be the wheel bearing/hub, but you should be able to feel that slack shaking the tire up/down when in the air...."
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,Azaron83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"Nope, no slack at all on either side.  Not even if it's at 50mph which my godfather checked.  Also doesn't grind.  Yeah, something loose or broken my suspicion.  At this point I'd point fingers towards the strut or strut mount but I'm not 100% sure.  It happens when the chassis/suspension compresses because it doesn't do it at all with wheels in the air, but i can't pinpoint what it is specifically.  Could it perhaps being halfway full on gear oil cause it to grind?"
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,Azaron83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:33 2015 UTC,If strut or mount then when you bounce the front end you should hear a noise or visually see what could be wrong.

I can jump on the hood and try to move the car side to side and it won't do it.  Could my control arms have good bad... already?  Driver's side has Moog; passenger side has ACDelco.  The reason is because they only had the Moog available on that side.  Good thing is that on both the ball joint is removable.  Visually I can see, as in the pictures in the OP, that on the driver's side the gap from the bottom of the strut to the axle is much smaller than on the passenger side.  I don't know if that's normal.  I'm gonna take out the left control arm and strut/shock assembly and inspect them and see if I can find anything.  The grinding is so odd.  Why doesn't it happen while going in reverse even if you floor it?"
MechanicAdvice,3ds5vj,Azaron83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:52:56 2015 UTC,When performing the repairs there may be a small shield on the lower ball joint. There is also a shield behind the rotor. Possible that they are bent and rubbing against the rotor?

However you have enough, the transmission only takes 1.7 qts so you should be fine. I'm pretty positive you have a broken clutch or a bad dual mass flywheel.

Common step is a new gas cap, clear the codes, drive it for a while and see if the code comes back.  If it does then a more expensive smoke test is warranted.   But also just get under i and do an general inspection of the evap hoses.  Also in the engine compartment.  Sometimes you will see a cracked and brittle hose right in front of you.   On the O2 Sensor that should be the one right after your catalytic converter (Sensor one would be the one before the cat) .  All that is is throwing a new one in there and clearing the codes.

MechanicAdvice,3dr5tr,grass-mastah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:59:09 2015 UTC,Oh OK.  Part of the California test is they have to make sure the light comes on even if there are no codes present.  This is usual done at start up where it stays on for 3 seconds.  But also can be illuminated in a diagnostic mode on some cars.
MechanicAdvice,3dr5tr,walkersm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:23:57 2015 UTC,"they are 2 codes, ones for the fuel system ones for the exhaust. the 141 is super easy to fix, get a new sesnor bank 1 sensor 2 is the sensor after the catalytic converter, sensor 1 is right on the exhaust manifold or right after it on the down pipe, the heater circuts died, it happens quite a bit and the only time i will just throw an oxygen sensor at a code, other oxygen sensor codes require more diagnosis. the other one is for the fuel system evap control. Basically this system consists of a sealed non vented fuel cap, a purge valve, a vent valve and a canister. when you switch the vehicle off the vent valve opens and allows venting of the tank, also allows you to fill the vehicle with fuel by venting the tank with the ignition off. when you switch the ignition on the vent valve closes and the fuel system is now sealed from the atmosphere, you start the car and the purge valve opens, this allows the engine to burn the fuel vapors from the fuel tank. the 440 code requires more diagnosis. it could be a bad vent valve, purge valve, the fuel cap could be bad. just another tidbit of info, usually when vehicles have evap codes its because the owner generally likes to overfill the tank, when the fuel nozzle auto shuts off the tank is full, By cramming that extra 4 or 5L in, it submerges the port for the purge valve on the top of the fuel tank and allows liquid fuel into the purge system which destroys the charcoal canister and can even flood the engine and or cause a no start. edits for spelling"
MechanicAdvice,3dr5tr,grass-mastah,0,Sat Jul 18 21:38:27 2015 UTC,Exhaust failed how? meaning it needs a new one?

I'm not really following what's going on there.   2)  If you aren't going to fix it yourself take it to a good independent mechanic and they'll fix you up.  It's not usually a good idea to to provide your own parts as you won't get a warranty on the repair if you do so.   The first code could be as easy as a gas cap or a purge valve.  The second code is probably going to need a new 02 sensor to fix.
MechanicAdvice,3dr5tr,imprl59,0,Sat Jul 18 18:25:26 2015 UTC,"Needs an o2 sensor for code P0141. The one after the cat, just replace it, it's a pretty common code. You're going to take it to a shop and theyre going to ask for an hour of labor to diagnose it, well tell them you know its the o2, but you're okay with paying the diagnostic on it because there's no way getting around it. But if they also find it's the o2 sensor, that the hour of labor should include replacement too since it's so easy to replace."
MechanicAdvice,3drjmy,Soundboard_Fez,2,Sat Jul 18 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. There are two types here. One uses a relay, blower motor and typical resistor block. The other with variable speed uses a relay, blower, blower motor speed controller, and HVAC controller head. In the latter version the HVAC controller head communicates digitally with the blower motor speed controller. So the problem can be in the HVAC head or the speed controller.   Unless the motor is binding or has intermittent power, it's not going to change speed on its own.   You can try doing a current draw test, check the relay, or other things. But if you have the system with variable blower motor speed and auto temp control, you have to go through the Ford checklist to nail it down to either the  Hvac head or speed controller....neither of which will be cheap."

MechanicAdvice,3drjmy,ScottsTot1,2,Sat Jul 18 23:08:19 2015 UTC,"I would suspect the blower motor speed controller or resistor.  For an actual check you could measure the voltage drop across the blower motor.   There should be two wires at the motor itself.   If you've got a manually controlled HVAC system, there will be a black wire and a black/red wire. If the voltage on the black and red wire is fluctuating while your blower is fluctuating then it's probably the resistor.   If you have an automatic HVAC system check the same wire, but it will be colored blue. Again if voltage is erratic with the blower speed, then the controller is all over the place and should be replaced. If voltage is steady and the blower is changing speed, suspect the blower motor."

MechanicAdvice,3dslko,I-See-A-Darkness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"The best thing I know to tell people is that the dealer is great for new car warranty repairs and difficult to diagnose issues.  For your run of the mill stuff they are always going to be way overpriced.  Someone has to pay for the big fancy building on the prime, highly taxed, real estate.  They also are going to look to put the car back in factory new condition.  Whereas an independent would tell you a gasket is weeping a bit, keep an eye on it the dealer is going to say ""oh my gawd, it's the worst leak ever, you have to fix it RIGHT NOW"" then they are going to try to sell you some maintenance service you don't really need.    Looking at your list of issues I don't see anything that would explain your issue.  If you had a transmission person rebuild the trans you need to take it back to him if you are experiencing the same issue.  so...  1) Yes the dealer is trustworthy, but only to a point.  They are going to be overpriced and may recommend repairs that don't really need to be done now.  If you aren't seeing oil drips under the car then who cares if a gasket is weeping?  It's a 15 year old car... I expect a drip every now and again.  Treat them like a pet snake.  OK most of the time but always stay on your toes 'cause they will strike if you aren't paying attention.  2)  Unless you are in California any parts store will read the codes in the computer for you.  Anyone can read an 02 code.  The leaks don't have a code, that's found on inspection.   A regular mechanic is going to tell you the same things as the dealer but hopefully not try to upsell you on a bunch of stuff you don't need or don't need yet.  Find an independent guy, no chain shops allowed.    3) Most importantly Follow the maintenance schedule like Gawd himself printed that page of the manual and gave it to you.  When a problem comes up get it addressed immediately.  The longer you ignore the problem the more expensive the fix is going to be in many cases.  Second most important is to be aware of the engine warning lights.  A temp or oil light means STOP RIGHT DAMN NOW!   I don't care if you have 5 pizza's in the back seat, if the oil light comes on the engine goes off.  You would be surprised how many people keep driving and turn a simple problem in to an engine replacement."

MechanicAdvice,3drtbc,RickMN,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:11:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! Problem is, fixing the oil consumption issue will most likely require an engine rebuild, and that just doesn't make sense on a car worth this little, so I expect he'll just fix it and sell it as-is. This car has other more minor issues as well and I think he just wants to be rid of it."
MechanicAdvice,3drtbc,imprl59,3,Sat Jul 18 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"If that's the case sell it ""as is"" now.  He's not going to get that money back from the potential buyer if he discloses the need for an engine rebuild."

Fuck the dumb cunts who are downvoting people trying to solve this. I had to upvote the bottom 4 comments just so they would appear again."
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,redrum_michelada,3,Sat Jul 18 23:51:05 2015 UTC,Fan clutch maybe.
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,nashwin715,3,Sat Jul 18 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but at 100 km/h he should be getting good air flow."
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,BigBlueJeep,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"I checked the fan now, it doesn't wobble and it spins freely maybe a 1/6 rotation when I give it a turn. When I start the engine, the fan starts spinning when the AC is on and stops spinning when AC is off. Can I test this some other way?   Would you say that it could be a problem with the electrical side instead of the mechanical clutch itself? When the AC started working after the acceleration, the air was immediately cold, which to me says that there wasn't a problem with cooling.  There hasn't been any engine overheating problems either. Then again, I'm not that familiar with the cooling system, especially when there's an AC unit involved."
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,BIueskull,2,Sat Jul 18 15:54:46 2015 UTC,Huh? Im fairly certain this is an issue with the condenser being clogged up and not cleared out properly causing a restriction  bumping up the speed probly cleared whatever gunk was in their or was providing enough airflow over the condenser to work
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,ESCAPE_PLANET_X,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"This sounds most sensible for me. In that scenario, there would be hot liquid from the ac to the cooler, and cool liquid from the cooler to the ac. Something blocked the circulation of the fluid so that there was only hot liquid in the part where heat is being transferred from air to the liquid. The ac then reaches a limit where it can't heat the stationary liquid any more, therefore it can't transfer any heat from the air, so the air doesn't cool down.   Then, as during the acceleration pressure in the pipes and the pressure difference behind and before the clog increased, the clog released and circulation of the liquid begun again. Then the hot liquid started moving from the ac towards the cooler and got replaced with cool liquid, so that the ac could immediately start to transfer heat from the air to the liquid.  English is a second language for me and I'm quite bad with physics and automobile terminology so I'm not sure if this makes sense. I'm more interested in learning what happened than fixing a problem, especially as the ac has worked fine before and after the incident. Although, I'm wondering if this means that the liquid should be replaced? I mean the pipes getting clogged like that shouldn't be acceptable, right?"
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,iBody,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:27 2015 UTC,I agree I had a old Saturn that had many different fix a leak type crappy additives used to patch the ac system and near the end of its life it would do crap just like this.
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,BigBlueJeep,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:28:04 2015 UTC,Also check refrigerant pressures and the ac's relays and fuses (sorry not familiar with Volvo).
MechanicAdvice,3dqeay,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"Check your coolant levels and make sure the vehicle isn't overheating. Check the refrigerant load if you can. A difference of +/- 2 ounces of refrigerant can cause the ac system have issues.  Make sure your fan is functioning correctly, electric fans will draw more amps when they are on the way out. Also, check that your belt is good and ensure the compressor is functioning correctly. Lastly, I guess, inspect your condenser. If it's all beat up and the fins are flattened enough, could be the cause."

Other than the transmission they are pretty solid cars. I have an 01 manual with 280k on it. Hers has like 140k.  Expect to get a timing belt done ASAP to keep it reliable. broken belts have put many Hondas in the junkyard before they were due.   Other problem areas: Control arm bushings, ball joints, trunk leaks, valve cover leaks, oil pan leaks, and radiator failure. None are major or terribly expensive.   EDIT: ""MIL"" is an acronym for ""Malfunction/Maintenance Indicator Light."" I had to read that sentence twice before I realized what you meant."

MechanicAdvice,3drh3s,imprl59,2,Sun Jul 19 06:12:52 2015 UTC,"Really depends on how many miles are on the car.  Less than 150 I would replace the trans without hesitation.  Between 150 and 200 I would have to think about it, have the rest of the car evaluated.  Over 200k and it doesn't make sense to put a lot of money in to it."

MechanicAdvice,3drh3s,mecanxs,3,Sun Jul 19 00:55:09 2015 UTC,OK.  Unless it's just a wreck otherwise I would go ahead and fix it.  You'll get another 100k+ miles out of it easy if you stay up on the maintenance and take care of it.
MechanicAdvice,3drh3s,DavidsUsername,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Where are you at? My 02 civic had the same issue, it got really bad and would just roll very slowly when you floored it. Bought a rebuilt trans for 600 at a local shop, did the swap myself in my garage in about 1:30, 1hr removal, 30 minutes install.  This was about a year ago and she's still rolling smooth at 180k miles!"
MechanicAdvice,3drh3s,mecanxs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"$600 for a proper rebuild? Only if they were friends of yours, as import parts are usually very expensive. I've paid $300 for Honda ball joints before because they were the only supplier."
MechanicAdvice,3drh3s,Omgninjas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:39:35 2015 UTC,"Holy Fuck that can't be right. Also 600 gets you rebuilt mechanical trans, all the sensors and silinoids off your old you swap over, but most of the time your, if you know what your doing, this will fix it. There are ways to make sure you silinoids are good. This is important as these cost around 300 a piece and this tranny has two separate, each which have two silinoids, for a total of 4. They are not the normal part to go out, which is why a newly rebuilt trans is a good fix. Or spend the same amount just to get in properly diagnosed. You choose."

MechanicAdvice,3ds5l9,grass-mastah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"leave the cap off the rad, does the fluid bubble as soon as you start the engine? theres much more places for the gasket to be damaged from overheating and warping the head to allow combustion gasses into the coolant vs where oil passes through the gasket."

If you are losing that much coolant the source of the leak should be easy to find, if you can't find it go to the parts store and get a coolant system pressure tester.  A lot of them rent tools like that so you don't have to spend the big bucks."

MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,bopollo,2,Sat Jul 18 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"Did the oil dipstick indicate it only needed 1/2 liter? it could have been down much more than that and your friend didn't add enough. If the engine lost a piston it would usually take out other parts, like connecting rods and such. Usually when this happens it slings itself through the engine block or oil pan and the accompanying oil gets slung through the hole it left behind. I've seen many blown engines with severe damage, and there, generally, isn't very much oil left in the pan, afterwards."
MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,jamesmech,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"The oil dipstick came up bone dry.  Not a trace of oil on it.  We're pretty sure that the broken piston didn't cause any sort of rupture in the engine.  And as I mentioned, we put more oil in and have left it parked for over two weeks now, with no signs of leaks underneath."
MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,AdamsHarv,3,Sat Jul 18 19:27:40 2015 UTC,My question is why do you care?  You are correct about the car likely being totalled. So why are you putting  $10 of oil in a ruined engine?   Is your friend trying to make you pay for the car or something?
MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,imprl59,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, and I'm trying to establish whether the car had some pre-existing problem.  I'm convinced that it did (I also know that she didn't take very good care of it) but I'd like to find the specific problem, if possible."
MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,AdamsHarv,2,Sat Jul 18 20:40:16 2015 UTC,You'll never find the problem now with serious engine damage.  When it's just sitting there all the oil is in the pan so the only leak that is going to show up is oil pan or drain plug. This is a shitty situation...  You might want to ask on legal advice what you're legally inclined to do.
MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,imprl59,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"I doubt he is legally responsible for anything. Its not like he crashed the car.   If she had been driving the car this would have happened to her.   Unless she could prove OP maliciously drained the engine of oil, i can't see any reason as to how he could be responsible."
MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,Cmon_Just_The_Tip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"I've learned to never apply my logic to a legal situation, thus my recommendation to ask over in legal advice.

MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,DropTopGSX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:54:16 2015 UTC,What a dick. Oil starvation is obviously caused by a pre existing condition. It's no like you can induce it by driving the car.  And if a car is poorly maintained...well there's your problem
MechanicAdvice,3drdf9,cptboring,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"Many oil leaks only show up when the engine is running and there is oil pressure, just putting oil in the pan isn't going to show 95% of leaks."
MechanicAdvice,3dryw3,Smilner69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:55:32 2015 UTC,The cam sensor and crank sensor are compared aginst each other by the computer. This helps tell if the timing is right and if there is a misfire
MechanicAdvice,3dryw3,cvarner42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:59:17 2015 UTC,By replacing the crank sensor instead of the cam sensor the problem is solved?  Or could the check engine light and code for the cam sensor come right back on tomorrow?
MechanicAdvice,3dryw3,cvarner42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:17 2015 UTC,It may come back. Honestly I would replace both. If the code comes back get the timing chain checked for slack/stretching
MechanicAdvice,3dryw3,cvarner42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:08:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice. I would have replaced both if the guy at Advance hasn't told me they were the same sensor. I should have done my research but had to get there and home while it was still running

MechanicAdvice,3dryw3,cvarner42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:57:49 2015 UTC,I would get the transmission checked as well as the torque converter.  Is it 4×4?
MechanicAdvice,3dry93,cameron1612,2,Sat Jul 18 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure a Corvette doesn't have a timing belt - the belt that you see is just the serpentine accessory belt.  Quite likely the belt is worn out, so you can change it first. If that doesn't help, the tensioner may be worn out and not keeping the belt tight enough, or it may be one of the accessory devices driven by the belt that's actually making the noise."
MechanicAdvice,3dr8ab,drfarren,3,Sat Jul 18 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"check fuses and relays. also check for power to blower. if there's power, the motor may have just went out. if so, get one from salvage yard and swap out.   basic troubleshooting technique. start from fuse panel and work to blower, check fuse, check fan switch, check for power at blower with fan switch ON. No blower with fan switch on and confirmed power... dead blower would be my guess."
MechanicAdvice,3dr8ab,anonymousforever,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"fuses are good, I'll look for the relays. If the motor itself went out replacing it is cheap, a new one costs $20 at the parts shops around here."

Mechanics are a weird breed, most of us are pretty strange. I've worked with a lot of stoners and it shows in their work, Can't say if it's a personality thing or a drug thing.

Of course if you get hurt on the job which is much more possible with a mechanic position than an office job, they are going to test you just to escape liability. That said, you can use fake urine to pass a test.

I also understand the view of the employer - your situation is not their problem.  Discriminating against people who use drugs is perfectly legal.  What is not legal is discriminating against someone who is partially disabled. If you are in chronic pain you should have a disability certification done.  Once officially classified as disabled, employers will be forced to make ""reasonable"" accommodations for you and cannot discriminate with regards to prescription use - unless of course the prescriptions conflict with a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (driving, for example).    If you are that severely injured - to the point that you require morphine - why have you not pursued disability?"
MechanicAdvice,3dp5jk,MilwaukeeMechanic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:43 2015 UTC,"I was 22 years old and Social Security screwed up my work credits for 13 years. So they will only offer me SSI which is a welfare like program that does not give you enough to live on, yet limits your assets to nothing. So they won't honor the disability insurance I paid for, like many men who suffered a disability during the AIDS crisis. An Administrative Law Judge went so far as to say that since this was the last time he was working for SS, he would be honest with me, and said that no one in my situation has gotten their disability straightened out. In short I have already been classified as suffering a full medical disability. The pain treatment has prevented me from going to into the initial stages of shock, which used to happen often. It doesn't prevent me from driving safely, 25 years no tickets or at fault accidents. Being classified as disabled and going thru my birth states job placement was good for being offer min. wage stocking shelves. They were hung up on the TBI I had, hence the coma, and told me that I could no longer use my two college degrees. Degrees that I earned after the accident. There is another problem which is the arrest record I have because while recovering from the car accident, and going to school in Washington state, I was supposedly in a Detroit Crack Gang, and even treated for a gun shot wound. This is because the law suit I had to file for medical costs, was considered a public document. And someone who read that my back was broken and I was in a coma assumed I was in going to spend the rest of my life in a nursing home or assisted living. So he assumed my name, social security number, etc. but no loans or credit. Sp I went through a period of years of being arrested and detained for nothing, only to be released. Until an intelligent Officer noted that: I don't have prison tattoos on my face, I am not bald, and have no gun shot scar. The whole ""drug war"" is complete BS. They are coming after the chronic pain patents again, there is even some state politicians who want to take our drivers licenses this time. They are so concerned about the small number of people who abuse pain medications, that they are willing to harm the much greater number of us who have legitimate medical conditions. At one point an Australian doctor who knew what was going on in America even offered to sponsor my application for asylum. So basically if you bought into the lies, you clearly drank the koolaid, as alcohol is the #1 drug problem in America. At work, on the roads and in the mortuary. If you have an employee who is a hazard, it is almost always obvious. Then again, sometimes it's not, but usually the drug testing solves nothing but making your employees nervous. The people you need to worry about can pass a drug test, as there is many ways to produce a false negative. Besides cocaine and alcohol users won't usually test positive."
MechanicAdvice,3dp5jk,DavidsUsername,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:24:11 2015 UTC,"If you truly are classified as disabled, then you should look into filing lawsuits against employers who cited anything related to your medical conditions as a reason for rejection or discharge.    The whole point of drug testing is that the employers are making an effort to prevent drugs from coming into the workplace, thus absolving liability.  It is much the same as a bar.  The guy at the door checks IDs. Do underage persons still get in?  Of course.  But the establishment still attempts to prevent the problem.  If someone underage comes through, gets wasted and runs someone down, the bar is likely to be immune because they made reasonable efforts to ensure underage persons were not served. The same is true with the drug tests.  There could easily be individuals that fake the tests, or use substances that wouldn't be detected (breath alcohol tests are also administers when randomly selected for a drug test).  That's not the point.  The point is the employer did what they could to stop drug use/influence in the workplace. Like it or not, agree with it or not, reality is that drugs are illegal and most employers will take whatever measures they feel necessary to protect themselves from liability associated with employee drug use/abuse."
MechanicAdvice,3dp5jk,GarretBlaze9999,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:01:33 2015 UTC,"You apparently don't understand lawsuits, as winning is not the problem, rather not collecting and having to pay the legal expenses is.

""Like it or not, agree with it or not, reality is that drugs are illegal and most employers will take whatever measures they feel necessary to protect themselves from liability associated with employee drug use/abuse."" The drug testing really does not achieve that. What it achieves is an environment of fear. Your employees don't have to use recreational drugs to fail, there are many reasons for failing, and they know that. Certain prescription drugs, medical conditions, and foods all can cause failures.  The better method is interacting with your employees, as they may not be fit to work for personal reasons, like a death in the family.  I knew a former dealer service manager, and the problems he had with drug use by the mechanics was: Alcohol, Alcohol and Alcohol. He even had to explain to customers, why their car ended up in police impound during a test drive more than once."

Never had a issue with employment because of it. Now as for your comments towards Firestone or Midas,well again I hate to tell you,they have better benefit packages than most dealerships. Not sure how long you have been in the field,or if you just live in a tiny bubble,but  the amount of ASE certifications that you hold plays a part in how much you can earn.

However, it does provide insight into that person's particular character.  As I stated in a different post, the major objection to weed is the liability issues it presents.  There is no standard as to what constitutes being impaired or under the influence.  The mere presence of marijuana in someone's system is reason enough to assign blame and liability.  As a business that is a risk I am not going to take.   I have multiple technicians who hold Dual ASE Master Certifications in both automotive and medium/heavy trucks, as well as L1 and L2 certifications.  My techs work on every type of vehicle and are required to hold a valid Commercial Driver's License.  The CDL requirement subjects them to random drug testing.  The tech I have working for me do not hold jobs, they have careers.  Many have been with the organization for more the 20 years.    In my experience, people who use drugs exhibit flaws in their character.  They aren't they type of people I want to employ.  If someone is willing to break the law for a ""high"" what other laws are they willing to break?  It's a risk that I would rather not have in my shop.  My whole point was that if OP wants to get serious about his life and his career (as his original post seemed to indicate), there will come time where he will have to stop smoking weed get with the real world."

Though obviously one of my many character flaws,I will make sure that I am vigilant in future posts (as not to offend your moral sensibilities further than I am). I hate to tell you bub,people who indulge in recreational drug use ARE part of the real world. Again I am sure that offends you,but if you are willing to over look talent because of some out dated moral code,well that's your loss (though I do get where you are coming from with the whole CDL thing). What the OP should note is that the work force (where careers take place) are filled with men like yourself as well as what can be considered your opposite. It really depends on the area he lives in (CDL will always carry a drug test). Truly depends on what he is reaching for,and the type of environment he wants to conduct said career in...I could sit here and go on about my professional achievements but there would be little point. I smoke (22 years running). Therefore regardless of what I (or any drug user) have achieved,it's pretty much null and void right? OP do yourself a favor and decide the level of career you would like,as well as the environment you with to conduct said career. I live in NJ. Most shops don't bother with it.

Just because you have joined that bandwagon does not mean that most independent repair shops have, as if they did, they would have trouble attracting the talent they need. And the independent shops are the ones who pay real money, while the dealer has a few highly skilled mechanics and a crew of parts replacers who earn very little."
MechanicAdvice,3dp5jk,MilwaukeeMechanic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"It's not health care costs, it's insurance liability.  An employer has to take reasonable steps to ensure their employees are drug-free.  Some insurance carriers won't cover employees if there is no drug-testing requirements in place. If an employee with drugs in their system is involved in an accident, and it is found that the employer neglected to maintain a drug-free workplace, the insurance carrier can deny coverage and the business can be held liable. This is the whole reason that drug testing exists.  It's not to punish users, but to protect employers."

Now unless you want to argue that morphine makes operating an office cart, or fixing a laser printer dangerous, the issue is just insurance costs.

Its the fact that something helps me out in my day to day life with absolutely no negative side-effects. I've been doing this for 7 years now. I do have a real job, live on my own, with no outside support. Your TL;DR comes off as very ignorant and rude. As far as what you allow at your shop, it's your shop and I respect the rules you put in place. My point is, I've talked to people who run chain shops (particularly NTB) and they were upset that they couldn't find enough techs to fill their shop because of the required drug tests. He said, If I interview you, train you in, and think you're a good fit, I could care less what you do outside the shop.  Edit: I'd like to clarify ""no negative side effects"" as that is probably not true (though not from what I've noticed).

MechanicAdvice,3dp5jk,rahtin,3,Sat Jul 18 04:12:48 2015 UTC,"The side effect that you are experiencing is an inability to get the job you want.  Your drug use is impacting your career and your life.  That's kind of the definition of a drug problem.  I'm not trying to come off as rude, but I do want to express reality.  NTB is not a good job.  They are recruiting low skilled workers, paying low wages, and no providing any real opportunity to development or advancement.    When I say real job, I mean career.  Something with excellent health insurance, profit sharing, retirement plans, etc.  As am employer and as a person, I tend to negatively judge people who use drugs.  I expect a certain level of maturity and professionalism from my employees, and drug use doesn't fit into that expectation.    Think about the average, middle class guy.  Works a good job, owns a home, has some investments, raises a family and looks forward to a retirement.  Do you think that guy smokes weed to get by day-today?  No.  Of course not.  It's a maturity thing, and that's what I'm getting at.  When you start looking for a career, you're going to have to ditch the weed and man up.  Real life sucks sometimes and stress makes you irritable.  That's life, that's reality, it's not an excuse to use."

Worst case scenario that piece of plastic blocks and oil return hole which would cause the oil to pool and not run back to the pan.  The chance of a 1/4"" piece of plastic doing that is slim.  It will most likely fall down to the pan and either be caught by the screen on the oil pickup or flushed away on your next oil change.

I'm rounding up: Oil change $40 Pads $35-50 Discs $80-100  Highest total: $190 for parts  $300 in labor seems high here. At most, all of this should take 1.5hrs (again, rounding up to be safe). $100 an hr... $150.  I'd say $190+$150=$340 is a fair price."

MechanicAdvice,3dpshl,thepowerofjeww,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:27:26 2015 UTC,"Honda tech here:  I also had the same car when I first got into the trade and ended up having an overheating problem, I tried caps and thermostats nothing seemed to fix it. I know for a fact that these civics can go through head gaskets, things to look for when dealing with a head gasket issue include: -Loss of coolant (check the recovery tank. Should be on min when car is cold and max when at normal operating temp)  -White colored smoke coming from exhaust (this means that the car is burning off the coolant)  -Milky oil, like coffee with creamer colored (happens when coolant and oil meet)  If the coolant appears to be overflowing out of the recovery tank (which happened to my civic) then you have something pressurizng the coolant system, mine had a slight tear in the gasket material between the water jacket and the cylinder. This is really common on these civics.   As far as a repair, it's gonna be expensive, best guess around 1k for parts and labor that includes the gasket and all the seals, if you have a good mechanic to take it to I'd also recommend getting the timing belt and spark plugs, and drive belts changed at the same time (recommend every 100k) it could save you about 500-600 later down the road if you get it done another time.

MechanicAdvice,3doscm,cptboring,8,Sat Jul 18 01:06:28 2015 UTC,hint.. you can actually get 5.0 ford engines out of models up to like 1999 in some like explorers..  you will need a different flex plate to go from the later balanced motor to the pre 82 balanced motor..  but its available from ford motorsport..  the 5.0HO motors from 88 to 92 are really popular.  just move your oil pan.. timing cover/ water pump and accessories onto them. you will also need a properly counter weighted harmonic damper. to match the balance of the 82 up 5.0..   a mazda rotary engine might be  a truly neat swap.. kinda noisy.. usually..   putting in if you could find a complete car to drag one out of with the wiring harness and computer and a bunch of other stuff.. the thunderbird turbo 2300 motors..  found in 86 to 89 thunderbirds.. and mustang SVO cars..

Not always the most practical, but they are super cool. They don't have a lot of torque though, so a modified or turbo rotary would be a good idea since a Maverick weighs more than an Rx4 or similar. A maverick is not much heavier than an Rx7, so a turbo motor should be fine. I also would recommend using a manual transmission, since you want all the power to the wheels you can get.    They can get some pretty good power with boost, you could create something unique that puts v8s to shame."

Thing is, I'm not hooked up to a trailer.  Nothing is plugged into the rear end.  This all happened simultaneously, but it could just be coincidence.  I didn't have grease on hand so I put used 10w on the slide pins (such a redneck I know and not near heavy enough).  One of them seemed to be sticky on the passenger side back when I changed pads but the driver side seemed fine.  I'll grease them with some quality grease... maybe that's my problem."

Your going to have to remove the pins and the rubber boot and clean the shit out of them then use proper green caliper grease liberally. I bet you the oil dripped out and started smoking.  While your at it. Crack open the bleeders. If fluid shoots out the hoses could be pinched and cause the caliper to stick.   I use the $5 piston depressor from Autozone. Basically you should be able to turn the screw by hand with no effort. If you have to crank it hard, replace the caliper.

I had it leak there at the circled junction, with the line seal coming off the pump, with my 95 aerostar, and the fix was to replace the line. If I recall right, this was 5+ years ago, the seal is built onto the end of the line, and the line had to be replaced. the power steering line should be able to be ordered from the auto parts store, or ford.

The first step would be opening the hood and watching it run to make sure the fan behind the radiator is kicking on.   The radiator side of things is airtight, but the fill reservoir isn't airtight. This is how the system self-regulates the pressure. It's spewing coolant, which means the coolant is too hot, not that there's a leak or anything.  The most likely candidate for too hot coolant is the radiator fan not kicking on. Check operation. If it doesn't come on, it could be a bad switch or relay."

If it does there is a problem with liftgate wiring, see dealer.  Does it start quick or act like a weak battery? Low voltage can cause multiple issues, or worse if you have water intrusion. You can check battery and connection, make sure alternator is charging good, and ck for any water under the carpet.  Found one transmission speed sensor which is less than $25 (not oem). You could ck this with a scan tool and see if speed on scan tool matches speed on speedometer when malfunctions. If it is reading correctly on scanner then it's likely in cluster. If the speed is also malfunctioning on scan tool, it is a bad wire or bad speed sensor. Depending on vehicle these sensors are located at rear of trans or rear axle, or if 4x4 possibly rear of transfer case.  On this vehicle you will likely require the factory scan tool to test everything unless you want to take a chance and purchase a speed sensor, but you need to know which one. With newer vehicles checking codes in all modules is the first thing you need to do. This one probably requires the factory scan tool.

Also wouldn't hurt to make sure your battery connections are on tight.   The no sound whatsoever thing makes me think the starter isn't getting power and I'd be checking the wiring.

Pin 3 which has a White and Green stripe wire close to the ignition switch should have power during Run, Start and Run only..   check pin 1  White and Red it should have power in ACC and RUN only. not while cranking.   inside the switch are spring fingers with contacts.. they go bad when they get a little carbon on the contact surfaces like this..  this is from a different switch.. http://i.imgur.com/FhPEkoj.jpg you can see the burn marks on the contacts..   want to have some fun.. perhaps fix it..  engine off.. disconnect the battery.. so there is no voltage at all.. sit in the drivers seat and work the ignition key from lock to cranking and back to lock 50 to 100 times.. take the key out.. put it in your pocket. hook the battery back up..  see if the car will start now..  the operation of the switch contacts without current can work thru some of the carbon crud without adding to it.. make the switch work again.. i don't have any pictures of the inside of those switches yet.."

MechanicAdvice,3dnt37,waynep712222,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"The voltage reading on the battery is meaningless when there is no load on the battery.  Static voltage is not a good indication of battery condition. You should check the voltage on the battery while someone else tries to start the car.  I suspect it will be very low - probably under 9 volts.  This would explain the radio resetting every time.  If the voltage stays around 10-12V while the engine is cranking, the battery is probably still good, and you'll want to look at cable connections and ground connections. If the voltage does fall below about 10V while cranking, you are going to need to replace or recharge the battery and continue testing from there.    I suspect that you have a failed alternator, and the battery discharged far enough to stall the engine (when the voltage falls below 9.6V or so, the car's computer will shutdown - thus stalling the engine).  Most likely, you'll install a new battery and the car will start.  Assuming it starts, you will want to look at the battery voltage while the engine is running.  It should be in the 13-14.5V range.  If it's not, it is a surefire indicator that your alternator is not charging.    Good luck."

Direct injected engines don't have fuel washing down the valves constantly and will build up some pretty severe carbon over the years. It can cause some running issues later on and require some very expensive cleaning once it gets that bad.  We use a snap-on machine that uses pressurized air to vaporize the cleaner (we use sea foam) and shoots it into the intake while the car is running. This method works really well.

MechanicAdvice,3do8ia,rioryan,2,Sat Jul 18 01:41:19 2015 UTC,Doing maintenance yourself on a new car is a major headache. If anything goes wrong (that you did or didn't cause) you're gonna have a tough time getting warranty work done with no proof that you've done maintenance. Sure you can show receipts saying you've bought oil and filters but it doesn't prove you did the maintenance on the car. I'm not saying it's right but its a tricky situation.    That's why a lot of people get work done at the dealer on new cars. But you can take your car to any independent garage you like and as long as they're using the correct spec oil it won't void your warranty either.

In my experience it requires about the same amount of care as chrome, regular cleanings and polishing every now and then. It can also be clear coated which is a clear paint that will protect it and still let the natural color shine through but that's kind of expensive. I should also mention the other than the DeLorean I don't think many cars come with any stainless from the factory it is usually only found in after market trim panels or replacement trim for classic cars and trucks.

MechanicAdvice,3doegj,ParfaitPubes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:44:27 2015 UTC,"Shocks and struts don't control ride height, they merely dampen road imperfections. However, a worn strut or shock could be binding. If it binds when in jounce, it would lower the ride height and change the camber angle. It could also be that a spring is worn, or some other worn out suspension component, causing your tire wear. Do you have a pic of the tire?"
MechanicAdvice,3doegj,jamesmech,2,Fri Jul 17 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"they merely dampen road imperfections   Not true.  Gas shocks contribute to supporting the vehicle. Link  From the twin tube section of that page: ""An additional benefit of gas charging is that it creates a mild boost in spring rate to the vehicle.""  From the mono-tube section of that page. ""...mono-tube shocks are a significant component, along with the spring, in supporting vehicle weight."" ""The area below the dividing piston is pressurized to about 360 psi with nitrogen gas. This high gas pressure helps support some of the vehicle's weight."" Penske makes thru-rod racing shocks, that eliminate the static and rising pressure a normal gas shock exhibits.  Also, the Gas Laws, Boyle's Law and Charles' Law, come into play with gas shocks supporting the vehicle.  Edit: Link Rod pressure is a force that is created by the internal pressure of a gas shock. It is an added force that resists the shaft being compressed into the shock. To compress the shock you must first overcome the rod pressure and seal drag. Depending on gas pressure and shock configuration it can be a significant amount. As the shaft compresses into the shock and the oil displaces as talked about in previous paragraphs – the gas will compress and the pressure goes up accordingly thus increasing the rod pressure as the shock compresses. You can watch this happen by putting a pressure gauge on your shock and push the shaft in and watch the pressure go up and down with the shaft movement. The other factor that affects rod pressure is called “seal drag” – it is the amount of drag that the seals, wipers and internal piston band have on the shaft as it moves in and out. Anything that touches the shaft as it move will create some amount of drag. Too much seal drag is a bad thing so minimal seal drag is optimum. I see shocks all the time with enough seal drag that the shaft doesn’t naturally extend from the internal gas pressure because the amount of seal drag on the shaft is greater than the than the amount of rod pressure pushing it out.   There is a simple formula for figuring out how much rod pressure a shock will have for different settings. You take the area of the diameter of the shaft in your shock and multiply it by the amount of gas pressure you have in the shock. This gives you the actual rod pressure of the shock before seal drag.   For example – I’ll figure the rod pressure of a shock with a 5/8” shaft at 50 psi. To figure the area of the shaft – PIxR2 or 3.1416 x (.312 x .312) = .306 sq. inches. So the area of the shaft is .306 of a square inch so we now multiply .306 x 50 = 15.5 pounds of rod pressure before seal drag. You can see now that a smaller shaft will have less rod pressure than a larger shaft does at the same gas pressure setting because the area of the shaft is smaller. (Most high pressure gas shocks have a static pressure of 360PSI.  360/50 = 7.2.  A 5/8” shaft at 360 psi = 111.6 pounds of rod pressure(outward force) when rod is extended.  More outward pressure when compressed.).   During my years on the Cup series - at times we were running front shocks with 1500psi in them – these were 5/8” shaft shocks and would produce about 450 pounds of rod pressure per shock. We did this so that the shock would do much of the work of holding up the nose of the car in the garage. We would unwind the front spring and the shocks would hold the nose up until we were on the track."
MechanicAdvice,3doegj,rcrracer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"The key phrase here is ""mild boost"". OEM and many aftermarket replacement struts add very little (although some) additional support to the suspension. The majority of the load is handled by the spring. A completely blown shock would lower static ride height very little, and would have almost no contribution to excessive camber wear. Note: This is, also, not a cup car or a vehicle engineered for handling in a track setting (closed course professional driver warning, here)."

For perspective, a friend was given a written estimate from Honda dealership to change rear brake pads on  2009 Honda Accord with OEM parts for $150 in Sacramento, CA.  I ended up doing it for her, she just paid for pads ~$50.  They should really look elsewhere for future repairs.

MechanicAdvice,3dmmgm,EngineerLuke,0,Fri Jul 17 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"The diagnostic fee is not outrageous...  the fact that they didn't waive it is.    Dealers (and other shops) generally charge diagnostic fees to look at the car and figure out what is wrong with it.  This is normal.  However, everywhere that I worked would waive the diagnostic fee if the customer choose to do the repairs.  The idea is that you don't want diagnose cars and then have the owner DIY it....  the shop wouldn't make any money.  So, it's not unusual to charge for diagnostics/inspection, but if you go ahead with the repairs, most shops will waive the fee.  The fact that this dealer did not is cause to think they are simply overpriced.    As a general rule - brake pads should run you (parts and labor) about $200-$300 per axle.  The price should include replacing the pads, resurfacing or reconditioning the rotors, bleeding the brakes as needed, and cleaning and lubricating the slides, pins, etc.  The price will go up if more items are needed.  Rotors and calipers cost more, and the brake fluid flush (which I think is unnecessary) is extra.  $1100 would not be unreasonable for coolant flush, brake fluid flush, rear pads, rear calipers, and rear rotors - and of course the diagnostic fee.

Do you whine and cry foul when you get home from Best Buy and find the same item cheaper on Amazon?  Some shops add 1/3, other shops double their cost. Shops don't buy their parts online. They buy them from a local jobber. Yeah they pay wholesale, but wholesale at a local jobber is still more than amazon prices.   Shops are no different than any other business. They have to make money on everything they do.   If you don't want to pay retail prices for parts, learn how to do your own car repair, find a shop with a lower parts markup, or find a shop that'll install customer parts (most won't and if they do, they usually charge a higher labor rate to compensate for the lost profit)"

The online places buy direct from the manufacturer for the high volume items and from the wholesaler for the rest.   Youtube is ok except there are a lot of hacks on there.   Your best bet is to buy a subscription to alldatadiy.com or eautorepair.net. Those are professional shop manuals with full step by step instructions and diagrams. Stay away from Haynes and Chiltons. Once you sign up, start reading the Technical Service Bulletins for your vehicle. You'll learn LOTS from the TSBs.   Next, find a ""forum"" for your particular vehicle. They're free and you can read what other owners have come up against in their repairs.   Finally, if you have to pay someone to fix your car, stay away from the chain operated stores.

MechanicAdvice,3djyxu,mclarenf1GTR,3,Fri Jul 17 00:12:19 2015 UTC,"You've possibly got a very dirty throttle body and/or sticking throttle linkage.  It could also be a very small vacuum leak somewhere.  I'd start by getting a can of carburetor cleaner and a rag.  Make sure the engine is off and cool so you don't burn yourself.  Expose the throttle body by removing the plastic tube that runs from it to the airbox.  Spray some carb cleaner on a rag and use that to clean the carbon build-up off of the throttle plate.  Using your other hand to hold the throttle open, clean all the black carbon build-up out that you can see.  There should be a couple of holes in the sides of the throttle body (possibly square, possibly round, I forget exactly what the inside of a Jeep throttle body looks like), make sure you clean them out as best you can as well.  The can of carb cleaner should come with a little straw taped to the side.  Use the straw to direct the carb cleaner directly into those little opening in the throttle body.  You can also use the carb cleaner to clean and lubricate the throttle linkage itself, which is what you're using to open the throttle with in the first place.  Once you finish cleaning all the black gunk out of your throttle, put everything back together and try to start the engine.  You'll probably have to work the gas pedal to make the engine start the first time, since you've got a lot more fuel (that being the carb cleaner that went down the intake during the cleaning process) in the intake that the engine isn't expecting.  Once the engine is running, let it idle for a minute or so and see if the engine is idling normally.  It should be idling around 750 rpm or so, maybe a little more if you've got the A/C going.  Basically anything under 1000 rpm while it's in Park would be acceptable I think.  You may need to clear the CEL before the computer will realize that it's supposed to idle properly.  If it's still idling too high, then I'd imagine you have a small vacuum leak somewhere.  Those are tricky to diagnose without specialized equipment like a smoke machine unless you can see an obviously broken vacuum line.  There are probably videos on YouTube on how to diagnose a vacuum leak in your driveway/home garage."

My personal opinion is that if you need to put more torque on a bolt than you can with a 'normal' sized ratchet, you either need to be using a breaker bar or the next size up sockets.  I'm guessing you have a 3/8"" drive socket set now - a 1/2"" set would be a good investment.

I'm a GM ASE tech, Ill see if I can try and explain a little bit about what goes on. ""In order to deactivate a cylinder, the exhaust valve is prevented from opening after the power stroke and the exhaust gas charge is retained in the cylinder and compressed during the exhaust stroke. Following the exhaust stroke, the intake valve is prevented from opening. The exhaust gas in the cylinder is expanded and compressed over and over again and acts like a gas spring. As multiple cylinders are shut off at a time (cylinders 1, 4, 6 and 7 for a V8), the power required for compression of the exhaust gas in one cylinder is countered by the decompression of retained exhaust gas in another. When more power is called for, the exhaust valve is reactivated and the old exhaust gas is expelled during the exhaust stroke. The intake valve is likewise reactivated and normal engine operation is resumed. The net effect of cylinder deactivation is an improvement in fuel economy and likewise a reduction in exhaust emissions. General Motors was the first to modify existing, production engines to enable cylinder deactivation, with the introduction of the Cadillac L62 ""V8-6-4"" in 1981. A solenoid control valve assembly integrated into the engine valley cover contains solenoid valves that provide a pressurized oil signal to specially designed hydraulic roller lifters provided by Eaton Corp. and Delphi. These lifters disable and re-enable exhaust and intake valve operation to deactivate and reactivate engine cylinders [1]. Unlike the first generation system, only half of the cylinders can be deactivated. It is notable that the second generation system uses engine oil to hydraulically modulate engine valve function. As a result, the system is dependent upon the quality of the oil in the engine. As anti-foaming agents in engine oil are depleted, air may become entrained or dissolve in the oil, delaying the timing of hydraulic control signals."" thats a pastebit from wiki, Basically what happens is the control valves plug up, and the cylinder starts to be deactivated all the time, and you end up with a steady missfire in the engine. Usually it starts with the number 1 cylinder because its the furthest from the oil supply solenoids."

Speed is another demon. 70 mph will burn it up in 1/4 mile, 10 mph might run 10 miles. Check craigslist for your area. Might find someone offering the repair like you want.

MechanicAdvice,3dk3kl,RickMN,3,Thu Jul 16 23:28:21 2015 UTC,Clore just came out with a new Li-ion pack for under $100.   LI-io is VERY tricky when it comes to jump starting. There are four different Li-io chemistries and they're all somewhat unstable when they get hot. So you have to be careful with overcharging and fast discharge--the two things you want most in a jumper pack. You want a pack where the manufacturer has added circuit protection.   You can't crank very long (5-seconds) and you have to remove the clamps immediately or the higher voltage when engine is running so the alternator output doesn't start the pack on fire.   Clore has over-voltage protection to prevent that and it looks like they've done their homework on the whole packag  Most of the cheap Li-io packs I've seen are nothing more than over-priced cell phone external batteries with clamps.

Likely illegal under federal law in the US due to degrading or disabling an emissions device. The idea is presumably that the extra chunk of pipe slows down the response of the post-catalyst sensor enough to fool the ECU into passing the catalyst test. Of course, in this case it looks like it wasn't fooled and raised another code for slow O2 sensor response."

In 86 the only V8 options were the 5.2l 318ci, or the 5.9l 360ci. Both are pretty tough engines though the 360 will be easier to find gofast parts for. Next, we need to know which 4 speed you have. Most W150's came with a normal ratio but you could have one with a granny 1st.   Once you get all that info we need to figure out your plans for the truck.

MechanicAdvice,3djm1q,Sahnge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"I'd take it in to have the alignment checked, and then let them know you have a lot of noise on the highway coming from the rear. You might have a strut going or a bearing on its way out. I would definitely take their recommendation, and then if possible do the work myself. An alignment shouldn't cost much, and if it doesn't fix the problem they can probably point you in the right direction."
MechanicAdvice,3djm1q,sunflashmace7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"I called and have an apt for next week.  The lady on the phone said alignment would address odd tire wear, which I do not think I have. She said it could be bearings going out.  Ive been watching some videos on youtube on how to check/replace.  I think can check, but breaking everything down off the rotor is somewhat intimidating. Any idea how much it costs to have bearings replaced at a shop? If it is over $400, I may give this a go this weekend."

I had my local trusted tire place just replace the bearings for me. Did all 4, and they charged me less than an hour. I took everything apart, and brought them just the part with the bearings in it. That might be the cheapest option. I'd discuss with them how much they charge for that, or if they'd even do it. Some places won't do it. It took me a couple hours, but it wasn't that bad. If it's just the back two it should only be a couple hundred I would think. Depends on what they're hourly rate is though."

On most in-tank fuel pumps, when you turn the key to 'ON' you hear a little whirrrrr from the tank, which is pump running and pressurizing. If you turn the key and it's dead silent, then your fuel pump is a goner.  A simple $5 spark checker would tell you if you're getting spark or not. Am pretty sure 1991 had just one igntion coil. Those do tend to fail when hot, so that would be second guess. If no-spark, could also be ignition module."

Fuel pumps get hot. Fuel pumps with broken windings get hot and fail as everything expands due to heat.  That said, your problem is more likely spark related.  /u/InfoSecGeek has the right idea. Get a cheap spark tester and check for spark when it stalls. If you have spark on 2 or more plug wires, the ignition system is ok, and you need to check fuel pressure.  You can buy a cheap fuel pressure tester (simply depressing the shrader valve is NOT an accurate test) at Harbor Freight.  Keep both tools in the car & check spark & fuel pressure next time the car stalls."

Hot Flooding: It's possible that that the heat is causing the carb push fuel out the overflow and flood the engine (if this is the case try lowering your float level a bit).   Assume you know how to start a flooded engine but: SLOWLY press the throttle to the floor (so accel pump does not squirt extra fuel) and while holding throttle wide open, crank the engine - DON'T pump the throttle. This will allow the most air for the least fuel, so the car SHOULD start after a little cranking blows the excess fuel through the cylinders."

Assume you know how to start a flooded engine   This is true, although I've had hit-or-miss results with this method.    Some days it works as though the engine has been flooded, some days it will fire up if the fuel pump runs for a minute or so, which is why I initially thought the bowl might be empty.

MechanicAdvice,3djaos,crankshaft123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:25 2015 UTC,a few things.  can you supply the number stamped in the drivers side of the float bowl.. it will usually start 1708XXXX  and a second line is a date code. i understand quadrajets really well and depending on the exact carb might give you some tuning tips to increase your fuel economy.  a picture of the top of the carb would be nice with the air cleaner removed.. in fact post several pictures of the carb or the engine from several angles so we can see what you have.. make it an album at imgur and  paste the link here.   what i would like next is what is happening to the fuel in the carb..  how does the fuel pump turn on.. does it come on with the key.. do you wait for it to fill the float bowl?? have you checked the full flow of the fuel with the line disconnected and extended into a clean clear plastic bottle at the carb inlet.   you are probably going to need to drop the tank..  you may want to toss some super magnets in either end of the tank bottom so any sediment that gets into the tank gets attracted to the magnets instead of going thru the fuel pump.  new sending units are available.  i would want to start testing at the cluster connector.. checking the resistance from the body to the fuel sending unit wire usually at 200 OHM scale.. or 2K ohm scale if you don't get a reading.. somebody complained about their ramcharger cluster not working properly.. http://i.imgur.com/Qw2Y7yM.jpg the tinnerman nuts were loose..   and your vacuum hose issue could actually be totally screwing up your fuel economy   most of the time.. with help it is easier to remove the bed of the truck to straighten out the fuel hose and fuel vapor issues   sometimes just loosening the bolts on the far side and removing them on the tank side and jacking the bed up at an angle.   lastly.. don't forget.. that there are also ways of adding a safari top to your cab with a donor roof spacers and screws. or latches.  lots of louvers..  do it for your hood also.  just the hood skin from another truck with the edge rolled carefully..

I have a Painless wiring setup, so I turn the key to ""on"", flip an ignition switch, the fuel pump switch, and water pump switch.  The pump is this little.. likely ancient.. electric pump mounted to a frame rail near the transfer case.  It hums and pumps well enough so the engine doesn't fuel starve, even when I'm driving like an idiot offroad.    I figured I would have to drop the tank.  I have a ton of old speaker magnets laying around, but as far as sediment goes I tossed in a new fuel filter a couple weeks back and it's still clean & yellow.  The truck doesn't appear to have sat idle for long periods of time in the last 35+ years.  Sadly, my instrument cluster is a hodgepodge of aftermarket gauges set into a fitted piece of diamond plate.  Beaters are an art form I guess.  The truck is lifted pretty substantially, and I drive on a set of dirt tires until I can find a cheap set of haphazardly constructed Chinese Certain Death-treads for my street commuting (http://i.imgur.com/6hetM27.jpg is the pic I used on /r/4x4 ), although I'm still probably going to end up dropping the tank when I get a weekday off and can hit up the auto hobby shop and use their jacks.

I think your plan is solid if you want to be extra cautious - worst case they may be able to just replace that end of the slip yoke if its really bad.    With replacing the yoke, you want to make sure the bearings have the proper preload.  This can turn in to a holy war - some people will say 'just torque it up good and tight, then run it' - you may get away with this, you may not.  The proper way would be to pull the axleshafts and carrier, measure the rotational torque on the pinion, replace the crush sleeve, and make sure you get back to the same point.  Decision is up to you on that one.  From the picture you posted of the driveline angles, its hard to see, can you post a brighter one?  The axle yoke should be pointed 2-3 degrees below the t-case yoke with a CV shaft like you have."

MechanicAdvice,3dj2sh,UserReeducationTool,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, extra crush sleeves and shims.  If its your first time too get an extra set of bearings to make setup bearings - I'm going to guess you don't have a clamshell bearing puller, and I have never had good luck with using a 2-jaw puller to get the bearings off without wrecking them.  Its not a terrible job, but one that you definitely have to go slow, take your time, and be exceedingly precise with.  With any luck, your old & new gears are marked with the pinion depth (+ or - in thousandths, look on the pinion head).  If they are its usually much easier to get a good pattern.  Do yourself a favor and pull the axles - yes its extra work, but you can work on them in a more comfortable position and won't be as tempted to cut corners.  You need a hydraulic press too - fair warning."

If you give an American manufacturing company a tolerance range of ±0.5 mm, they give you parts that are ±0.2 mm. The best of the Chinese manufacturers, at their absolute best give a ±0.6 mm, and many more are worse.

MechanicAdvice,3dggxq,DoctrVendetta,3,Thu Jul 16 02:07:24 2015 UTC,A MIG welder will do what you want and is easy to learn.  Hit craigslist or similar for a used Miller MIG.  You can also talk to your local welding supply store.  I picked up a Millermatic knock off for $350.  Keep in mind you'll want to to keep a little over $200 aside for a shielding gas bottle and regulator (if not included with the MIG).  Another option is to look for a sale at Eastwood.  I have their TIG and Plasma cutter and they're pretty well put together.  I got both together on sale for just over $1k.

MechanicAdvice,3dggxq,Rosie2jz,2,Thu Jul 16 08:56:07 2015 UTC,"I have a lincon 110 MiG welder and it's been dead reliable for close to 10 years now but if you have access to 220v in your shop/garage then I would recommend trying to get one because sooner or later you will want to weld thicker stuff. Some modern welders are dual voltage so you can run higher amperage on 220 or run them off 110v if you have to take the welder somewhere you don't have 220v access. I bought a 220v AHP alpha tig TiG welder from amazon about a year ago so I could weld aluminum and it was around 800 + 250 or so for the tanks and works great so if you have any plans to do very delicate welding or want to do aluminum regularly then you may want to consider an ac/dc TiG.  MiG = hot glue gun of welding, takes minimal practice and can do sturdy welds in less than ideal conditions. TiG is better for precise stuff and aluminum but is much, much slower and is less forgiving of oxidized metals and takes a fair bit more practice.  Like others have said whatever you decide budget for your tanks as well. If you are only going to be doing ferrous metals with a MiG most people go with ""steel mix"" 75%Argon, 25% Co2. If you get a tig then typically you go 100% argon but co2 and helium are also used depending on what you are welding."

It goes very low (35 I think) so that you can do thin stuff and not blow through, but also goes high enough to do some 3/16"" (It's rated to 1/4, but I haven't tried it yet). You can add a spool gun and do aluminum, or any Lincoln accessory.   Budget a couple hundred more in for consumables though. $200 for gas, $50 for a cart, $100 for misc (gloves, hood, magnets, brushes, etc.), $20 for wire. It all adds up quick.

I have a Lincoln 175 amp welder & its built numerous off-road vehicles.  Anything 220 volt & 175 amps and above should work for your needs.  Miller or Lincoln is really a personal preference and depends on local dealer support.  You NEED 220 volt service for any heavy duty welding - the 110 volt welders will work for light stuff, but for any heavy fabrication they fall way short.  Some of the Chinese knock-off welders are decent, and some are terrible.  I spent the extra bucks to get a name brand - its a long-term investment, so spend accordingly.

Though I would think there should be a related ECM(engine computer) fault.   ESP is traction control, so while yes it has some to do with steering. Calling it a power steering light would be incorrect.   The best thing would be to get a fault readout with a Vag-Com(VCDS) scan tool or a dealer scanner. Post those codes up."

I was mostly looking to see if I had something incredibly expensive to fix (hope not), and whether or not I would have to get the car towed to shop.   Would it be advisable for me to drive the car to the shop, given its condition (stalls out at stoplights, low idle RPM)? I was recommended a repair shop about 5 miles away, or should I call AAA for the tow?"

Below is a fix copied from this forum post: http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/topics/3037053/afoulk#Post3037197  snip Many of these engines have automatic chokes, and these chokes tend to stick either open or closed. If the engine is a no-start, and if the ignition coil is good, then it's likely that there's a problem with the choke. They're usually easy to fix...some lubricant often gets them working again (on the choke thermostat on the engine block, not the choke butterfly in the carburetor). You should be able to take the air filter out and look into the carburetor and see if the choke butterfly is open or closed. On a cold engine, it should be closed all the way; if it's open or partially open, then that's most likely the problem right there. If it has a manual choke, move it back and forth and be sure the choke butterfly does indeed open and close as you work the manual choke lever."

After you fix the shifter, then you can assess the transmission issue - if there is any.  From the sound of it, it seems like the clutch is not releasing all the way and that it's ""dragging"" a little bit.  Hydraulics (clutch slave and/or master cylinder) sound like likely causes.  The good news is the clutch slave cylinder is external to the trans and can be changed very quickly, I think it's held on with two bolts...."

MechanicAdvice,3dgdcq,jamesmech,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"The answer is, yes, the entire a/c system may have been contaminated with metal fragments when the compressor gave out. You should replace the receiver/dryer whenever that happens, and also flush all of the high side and low side lines and the evaporator and condenser. You may want to find out if there is an inline filter available, so it can capture any debris that might be missed by the flush, however, I've never had one come back despite the lack of a filter. The flush is pretty thorough. It is, definitely labor intensive, but you should be able to save the cost of the lines/condenser/evaporator. Not sure if that's a fixed orifice type or Thermostatic expansion valve type, but in either case it also makes sense to replace whichever it is. The function of those last 2 parts I mention are the reason the a/c gets cold. Imagine a can of canned air and what happens to the can when you spray. It gets frosty. The orifice converts the liquid refrigerant to a vapor (aerosol) so that it can drop the temperature in the evaporator. The condenser isn't bad to replace, but the evaporator usually requires the removal of the dashboard (instrument panel). I forgot to mention... Some Honda compressors are covered under an extended warranty through your dealer. You should be able to call them and supply the VIN, and the miles, and they should be able to tell you if you have coverage or not."
MechanicAdvice,3dgdcq,imprl59,2,Thu Jul 16 01:59:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a cheap repair on that vehicle but call around a bit to the a/c specialty shops and see what kind of quotes you get for your area.    The compressor blowing chunks throughout the system is nothing special to do with that vehicle.  That's a problem across all makes and models.  I'm showing $600 for the compressor and 2.4 hours to replace.  Add 2.3 hours (and $20) for the receiver/drier and 2.7 hours and $70 for the expansion valve.  Add another $100 for vacuum and recharge.    The gotcha here is the condenser.  Used to be it was one long copper tube that wrapped back and forth from top to bottom of the condenser and the refrigerant flowed through it.  If the compressor failed and blew chunks it was no big deal to just flush it out.  Now the condensers are parallel flow which makes it much harder to flush the crap out. If you don't get all the crap out then it will migrate to the expansion device and clog it up.    The mechanic has a flushing machine which does a pretty good job flushing the newer condensers.  When I was doing them I would guess 1 out of 20 came back and we'd have to flush it again.  I've never worked on the a/c on this vehicle but the book times are a crazy amount of work.  On a ""regular old"" car where the expansion device was right there in my face it was worth the risk and I could eat the hour labor on the 1 out of 20 that didn't work.  My guess is that this one is just so damn much work he's not willing to risk having to go back in there and is just going to replace the condenser  ($312 parts and 1 hour labor).    So it looks like I would be charging a grand in parts and 8 hours labor + a vacuum and recharge.  If that's the case he's giving you a deal.    Hopefully someone will come along and explain why the book time is so high for this repair on your vehicle.  Only thing I can figure is the stuff is really buried."

Well logically it's a problem on the +12V side of the circuit, though you should test for faulty grounds just in case.  Electricity takes the path of least resistance, so logically, assuming the +12V feed for the headlamps and running lights is common, then the headlight half of the circuit is drawing too much current.   Do the mods to the relay involve adding a resistor or diode by any chance? If more resistance was added to the wrong leg of the circuit, then the current to running lghts would be reduced."

The best (cleanest looking and least likely to fail in the future) repair is the most difficult in this case.   Ideally, you want to cut out the damaged portion of wire & make your splices inside the hatch and inside the body of the car. This usually means removing the trim panel on the hatch and dropping the headliner down to access the wiring.  Use this method if you plan on keeping the car. You can just scab the broken wire together with a heat shrink butt connector but it will fail again. And it will probably fail in less time than the original wire failed."

Sometimes loosening the hose clamp on the hose going to the throttle body helps get the air out a little quicker.    Also, don't panic if the idle surges and hunts up and down while you are doing this.  This will happen if there is air in the cooling system around the idle air control motor.  Get all the air out and the problem will correct itself."

MechanicAdvice,3defjg,waynep712222,6,Wed Jul 15 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"Voltage drop tests are your best friend.  If you don't know how to do them, I'll try to explain briefly.   Perform a voltage drop test on the positive cable connection.  Place the red lead on the center of the battery POST (not the cable end). Place the black lead on the cable end.  Have a friend crank (or try to crank) the engine.   Voltage drop measures the amount of voltage consumed - so when you are using the leads so close to one another (red on post, black on cable end) you should see almost zero voltage.  When cranking you might see 0.1v.  If you see something else.... anything about 0.1 or so, you have a problem.  Voltage is being consumed to overcome resistance in the circuit.  Because you are using your two meter leads, you know the resistance is between the two leads....  in the example above, the battery cable connection.    Assuming that you don't find any problem with the battery cable connection, you can move on to other parts of the circuit.  Ideally, you could evaluate the whole positive side at once, and if something is found work your way back through the circuit till you find the point of high resistance.    Place the red lead of your multimeter on the center of the battery positive post (leave everything connected).  Place the black lead on the positive terminal of the starter motor.  Have a friend crank the engine over.  The voltage reading should rear nearly zero - considering you're testing the whole positive side of the circuit you might see 0.5v....  but it should not be more than 1.0v for certain.    If you see near zero voltage, you can be certain that there is no problem in the positive side of the circuit.  If you see high voltage (over 1.0v) you would need to move the black lead backwards in the circuit and retest.  For example, move from the positive of the starter to the solenoid....  then back to the solenoid positive cable... and so on all the way back to the battery cable connection.  Essentially you're measuring the amount of voltage consumed in each segment of the circuit.   The ground side of the circuit can be tested in the same way, except you'll reverse the leads.  Place the red lead on the ground post (or case) of the starter and the black lead on the center of the negative battery post.  Crank the engine and record the voltage reading.    This video explains it pretty well....  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRPLgH6uZg"

Like, the horn beeps hella loud, all the power windows work fast but the starter does what? Click, nothing, or turns the engine but really slow? I've seem weird starter problems on trucks with the 5.4l. Fuse 101 sometimes gets a problem, the relay can get a problem and the terminals that it plugs into on the fuse box can get loose. The yellow/light blue wire that goes from the relay to the starter solenoid can get loose or messed up. And also I've seen the main ground wire where it goes on the engine get loose. If it's possible it would be good to scan for any low/high voltage codes in the control modules, too."

I'm gonna bring a multimeter home from work today and check the voltage for sure, but I'm 99% sure it's not the battery, because I swapped a new one in and same problem.  Fuse 101 looked ok, and the fact that it starts with a jump indicated to me that it was prob not a fuse problem - but car electrical not my area of expertise."
MechanicAdvice,3defjg,Downtownpiglet,2,Wed Jul 15 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, it seems more like a ground side issue so you can check the voltage drop when you get a meter.  If the engine ground is good and the starter solenoid is clicking but the truck will only start when you are jumping it then it seems like you may have a bad starter. Have your voltmeter on your trucks battery. Also have the jumpstarter vehicle hooked up to your truck ready to jump it, but not running.Then try to start your truck while watching the voltmeter. If the meter is reading 12.5 volts and when you crank the truck over it drops below 9 volts the starter is likely pulling down too much voltage. Or if the truck will only crank over when the jump vehicle is running and giving a steady 14 volts to crank the failing starter."
MechanicAdvice,3defjg,MrBlandEST,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"That's a good thought, I had it too, haha - about the starter-pulling-too-much-voltage issue. I tried starting the truck off the jump vehicle while not running, and it worked, so starter appearing to be pulling normal voltage.  Basically, I think I'm just gonna have to crawl in with the voltmeter, and see where the resistance goes up to infinity."
MechanicAdvice,3defjg,MilwaukeeMechanic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, time to do some testing with the voltmeter. I don't recommend doing resistance checks though, because you are going to be testing a ( hopefully) powered circuit. Stick with the voltmeter unless you're doing key- off testing.   You want to see less than .3 volts on the engine ground with the key turned to crank. You want to see battery voltage on the yellow/ light blue at the starter, and battery voltage on the fat starter wire and battery voltage should not drop below 10 volts."

MechanicAdvice,3defjg,natttynate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"The other problem with resistance testing is that your aren't putting a load on the circuit.  A corroded cable - or one with only a single strand of copper remaining can still read continuity, but it won't be able to handle current flow.  A voltmeter only passes a tiny amount of current through the circuit.    Think about this....  what if you had the starter motor hooked up with tiny gauge wiring.  It wouldn't read an open circuit when you test resistance, but it certainly wouldn't be able to handle the current flow necessary to crank the engine.    Voltage drop tests are far superior because the assess the condition of the circuit under operating conditions with the entire circuit loaded."

MechanicAdvice,3defjg,wh0ligan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly how do you connect your jumper cables?  EDIT:  Suppose you connect your red lead from positive battery terminal of F-150 to positive battery terminal of donor, and connect the black lead from F-150 engine to negative battery terminal of donor.  This effectively bypasses the ground connection between your battery and the engine (and starter).  I'm going to assume that's how you jump it for now.  You might try connecting a jumper cable (just the black lead) between F-150 negative battery terminal and the F-150 engine, if that allows it to start, then you know your battery is good enough (which I think you know already) and you also learn that some part of the ground path is not good enough.  Next you could connect between engine and chassis, to further divide-and-conquer.  One last question - is this completely repeatable?  If not then of course everything becomes much more difficult as you can't really trust the result of a single experiment."
MechanicAdvice,3defjg,cptboring,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"Everything has been repeatable (at least n=2) so far. Currently, I just  connect the jumper cables via terminals. And good thought, I'll try doing a terminal to engine block jump to see what that shows."
MechanicAdvice,3defjg,wh0ligan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  So when you jump it, you connect the jumper cables from +bat to +bat and from -bat to -bat, and that allows it to start?  If so, then your ground cables are good, because you are not bypassing them during jump start.  What kind of condition are the battery terminal clamps in?  Do you have something weird like a crack in the metal between where the battery cable is crimped and the terminal clamps onto the battery terminal?  I've never seen that but you've got something strange going on.  When attempting to crank, what does battery voltage do?  (Please measure on the actual terminals of the battery itself, not on the battery cable clamps)."

The cable wears out at that spot. Several companies sell tiny (expensive) 90° gearboxes to make the bend and allow the cable a straight run. However, If the old cable lasted 30 years before breaking, I would absolutely suspect something binding up in the speedo cluster itself. If you have a new one, absolutely put it in.

Your mechanic should be able to use a small section of cable to spin it by hand and tell if this is the case or if there is a different problem.

So the question is, does your ABS light come on when you turn the key to run? If not, you probably don't have ABS, which would make sense why the shop used a non-ABS wheel bearing.

MechanicAdvice,3dfkmd,Bluecbt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:48:10 2015 UTC,"Has car even been in an accident? Look for wiring harness damage.  Your headlght issue is probably a bad relay. In some cases a circuit will send voltage but not enough current to do the job. So to the meter, you are getting 12V, but the circuit cannot supply enough current (high resistance) so the bulb won't light. If you have the vehicle schematic you could trace it back to the switch or blinker-relay to prove that. Look at the socket/bulb of the rear turn signal on that side. If it were wet/shorting, it would be hogging all the current on the circuit. The fast blink happens because the two lamps are in parallel and with less resistance the bi-metallic strip in the blinker gets half as hot. If the rear bulb resistance is too high, the front won't work. Also try it with only the front bulb in place.  It could be a bad blinker relay, because if the contacts are bad the amount of current going to the light would not be correct. And unfortunately it could be the turn signal switch as well."

MechanicAdvice,3dfinn,JasonMaloney101,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:01:15 2015 UTC,A lack of airflow is one possible cause of overheating. One thing that I often see overlooked by DIYers and techs alike is if the electric fan is actually working. With the engine running and AC on the radiator should be on. If not you need to determine why.
MechanicAdvice,3dfinn,JasonMaloney101,2,Thu Jul 16 04:02:51 2015 UTC,Was the radiator OEM? I've heard of some people having issues with aftermarket radiators with that model.  Check the orientation of the thermostat. It should have a small bypass hole which must be in the correct position inside the thermostat housing.  The bleed screw is on the engine side of the upper radiator hose.  How are your overflow tank and heater core looking? Have you tried changing the cap or backflushing/bypassing the heater core?  EDIT: what type of coolant are you using?
MechanicAdvice,3dfinn,cptboring,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"Radiator was OEM.  The radiator in general is a problem piece because of the plastic housing.  It's brand new.  I don't know if the thermostat was installed correctly for sure.  However, I don't believe it could have been installed backwards at all, as the thermostat is also the seal for that particular radiator hose.  The overflow tank looks just like the one in the video.  When the car overheats, the right side of the tank is filled with boiling water that comes out of the radiator, as expected.  I'm not sure what the heater core is, or where it is.  I can't answer that.  I'm using just water as I go through all of these steps, as it should run fine on water.  It originally overheated with a 50/50 mix of water and antifreeze.  Not sure on the brand."
MechanicAdvice,3dfinn,cptboring,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:04:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the thermostat was installed correctly for sure. However, I don't believe it could have been installed backwards at all, as the thermostat is also the seal for that particular radiator hose.   Backwards isn't the concern. Take a look at these diagrams:  http://imgur.com/MGp85dr http://imgur.com/x5s7nSo  See the air bleed valve? Make sure it is oriented correctly in the thermostat housing.   I'm not sure what the heater core is, or where it is. I can't answer that.   Warm fluid from your vehicle's cooling system flows through the heater core to provide heat to your vehicle's climate control system. If your heater isn't working, you might have a clogged heater core. This shouldn't be enough alone to cause your vehicle to overheat, but it can certainly contribute if there are already other problems with the system.  You need to run your heater on high during draining/filling or bleeding to ensure the entire system is flowing properly.   I'm using just water as I go through all of these steps, as it should run fine on water. It originally overheated with a 50/50 mix of water and antifreeze. Not sure on the brand.   Aside from the fact that proper antifreeze provides corrosion protection to the entire system (including your new radiator, water pump, and thermostat), antifreeze has a higher boiling point than water alone. If you run straight water, it will begin to boil at a much lower temperature, filling your cooling system with steam bubbles which will further limit its ability to operate correctly.  As with the heater core, I'm not saying the water is the only problem; rather, I'm saying the water is going to make it more difficult to diagnose and correct the problem, especially if the problem is due to air in the system.  The correct formula for your vehicle is a 50/50 mix of Zerex G-05. You can find it at several major auto suppliers.   In addition, I ran some Blue Devil Head Gasket Sealer through the system, thinking it might be the head gaskets. No luck, still over heating.   Did you also use the Blue Devil flush first? Or did you run the sealer through a dirty system? Did you do this before or after replacing parts? Those sealers-in-a-can come with their own set of issues and should generally only be used as a last resort.  If you want to rule out your head gasket, do a block test. You can rent the tool from your local auto parts store.   The only difference that I can see is that my Liberty also has the clutch fan in addition to the electric fan. As best as I can tell through research, the Libertys will have both fans if there is not a fuse option for the high speed on the electric fan. Mine does not have that fuse, so it has both fans.   Have you been able to verify that the clutch fan is operating properly? It has its own drive system which can sometimes need to be replaced."
MechanicAdvice,3dfinn,cptboring,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"I had no idea the orientation of the thermostat could cause it to overheat.  I can adjust it.  The heater was working well.  I don't think the heater core is causing the issues.  While I understand that antifreeze in the system is the correct way to go, I've replaced 6 parts on the vehicle and didn't want to keep refilling it with antifreeze between each test.  It has moved less than 30 miles on water, and I don't intend to run it on water when it's fixed.  The Blue Devil Max was done as a last resort, after all the parts listed in the OP were changed.  The system was giving me clear water, and I didn't think a flush was necessary.   The clutch fan appears to be spinning at the proper speeds, and it's brand new."

Aren't you a little cheaper than that? Do it yourself. The worst that happens is you can't get the scratches off and you take it to a body shop. If you get the white paint off yourself, you just saved hundreds. Its worth a shot.   I'd get a tail light from Amazon or Rockauto. If you have Amazon prime you may be able to get free shipping. The last resort would be to buy the tail light at the dealership. A real Toyota-brand tail light will cost probably twice as much as ones sold on Amazon or Rockauto. They'll all look the same, I just like saving money.   Installing the tail light is easy. Open the trunk, find the plastic or carpet covering up your tail light. Pull that stuff out of the way. Sometimes you'll have wing nuts holding your tail light in place. You can unscrew them with your fingers, no tools needed. Then disconnect the wiring and pull out the old tail light. Even if it doesn't have wing nuts, the most you'll need is a wrench or a pair of pliers to get the nuts out. There is probably a youtube video or a how-to tutorial on a corolla forum out there that'll show you in detail with pictures how to take that tail light out. You may have to take the old light bulbs out of your broken tail light and put them into your new one (as some new ones don't come with bulbs) but you're smart, you can change a light bulb.   There is a detailing subreddit that's all about detailing cars. You can ask there about specifically what product will remove the paint from your vehicle.   If there's a $200 or $300 savings for doing it yourself versus taking it to a shop, you better bet I'd be at least taking a stab at it to save some money."

When there's hundreds of dollars at stake, why not give it a shot?   The problem with your tail light is you can't just buy the cover red plastic cover. The cover is glued or melted onto the reflector part. So you have to replace it as a sub-assembly.   If you have Amazon Prime you can probably get free shipping on a tail light for your car. Rockauto might be cheaper, but there's no free shipping there. Also look on eBay if you have an eBay account.   In the meantime, you're going to want to cover up the reflector part of your tail light if you intend on still driving the vehicle. Most auto parts stores will have a red translucent tape you can use to cover up broken tail lights. If you drive around with the vehicle like it is in the pictures, you're going to blind people at night with your brake lights or turn signal and cops don't like that. A few bucks for a roll of red plastic tape might keep you from getting a ticket until your new light comes in the mail."

Worn shocks/struts will increase the load on the front brakes due to increased weight transfer. Rear calipers should self adjust.   Hope this helps.

MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"Any car made since ~1980 is going to have electronic ignition and fuel injection.  But don't forget that carbs and conventional ignition might be a little easier to work on, they are a lot less reliable. Am not sure I would trust a 1970s car as a daily driver. I think 1975 was when GM went to electronic ignition, and fuel injection for those trucks started with 1987 (throttle-body injection) and then multiport injection in 1991 or so.  A Ford F150 or a four cylinder Toyota pickup or Honda Civic are as simple as it gets these days. Overall most four cylinder cars are not all that tricky to work on (small simple engine) and cars like the F150 (V8 in a big engine bay) are also not terribly difficult."

Current cars have so much in them, you just can't work on them.   At what point did Toyota trucks and Honda Civics become impossible to do all the work yourself? When did tons of electronics get introduced into cars? What specific things should I avoid in new cars?"
MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,InfoSecGeek,2,Wed Jul 15 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"In new cars the most difficult ones are V6 engines in a small car, so Accord V6, Maxima, and similar are difficult just because engine is so big. Similarly, some cars (Mercedes, BMW, Lexus) have so much electronics they can be very difficult to service.  In general the less reliable the car the more you need to work on it, so there's kind of a toss-up between extremely reliable. but maybe not so easy to work on (modern Honda/Toyota engine) versus fairly unreliable yet very easy to work on (1974 Chevy Nova straight six). Personally I would go with more reliable and harder to work on. Honda and Toyotas, in general, are very possible to work on yourself. As long as you stick to a smaller engine (4 cyl) so there is room to work, there is not much you cannot do yourself. There are some things like the anti-lock brake systems that do require special tools, even to bleed, but overall in terms of normal maintenance items, a DIYer can do 99% of all that."

MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"that just sounds too good to be true! I've thought that working on the mopeds and scooters waseasy (well, kind of, I had some stumbling blocks being new to working on things). Cars have more systems, so there is added complication. For one, I had a seized moped engine, I was able to just swap out the cylinder and head in about an hour, total cost of $89. For a car, you'd have to pull the whole engine, take the engine block somewhere to get the cylinders honed.....that seems like a MAJOR effort and a HUGE expense. I've never looked into it, so I could be wrong here.  I'm just wondering though, with cars I've had transmissions go out, and even junk yard transmissions would costs THOUSANDS. This is kind of what I wanted to avoid, I mean, how can a part break that costs thousands of dollars? I just don't know enough about these things.  I'm just worried I'll start working on a car I buy for $2000, and I find I need like $3000 worth of parts to get it going. What are some of the most expensive and hardest things to work on? I mean, what's a deal breaker mechanically for an old car? I don't even know what people mean when they say the transmission went out. Is this just an automatic car thing? For the scooter and moped, replacing/fixing the clutch was easy and pretty cheap, like, less than $100 for a simple clutch rebuild. Is the same true for a car?"
MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"It's all hit or miss. Good cars, properly maintained, don't break so much. A Honda might maybe need a new AC compressor or radiator and maybe an alternator or starter over twenty years....it's not like you need to pull the engine/transmission and rebuild it, those tend not to break if properly maintained. Lots of things can break on cars. On an old car you start with an engine in reasonable shape with good compression, no obvious leaks, from a car maker with a good reputation.  Then you look at how the car was driven and how it was maintained. If you get a 1995 Honda Accord driven to Bingo once a week by an old lady who had the oil changed every 3000 miles, you've got a good one. Cars can be expensive to repair. A transmission 'going out' can be anything from a twenty dollar electronic sensor gone bad to some catastrophic total internal failure that could cost a couple thousand on a modern front wheel drive car."
MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,zzyzzx2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"It's all hit or miss.   I guess that's part of how this works. I'll need to do research into buying used, I've had three cars that I've sold for scrap after paying a decent amount:   very clean expedition, transmission went out 3 months after buying for 3500. Had less than 100k miles. Super clean, drove great for a while, then it just went out. I had taken it to a shop after I bought it to do a look over. Estimates ranged from $6000 at a dealership, to like $2000 just in parts from a junkyard. We ended up selling to some guys for $1000. Bought an old V8 (Pontiac?) like 10-15 years ago, it was overheating all the time, ended up selling for scrap Wife bought a VW Golf for $2500, turns out it was totally rusted out, dealership told us to sell it for scrap (which we did, got $300 out of it).   I have no clue what to look for when buying a used car apparently, I need to do more research. I guess obvious things would be cosmetic condition, maintenance records, etc. However, that expedition had a mountain of maintenance records, the people seemed rich, the car was super clean, and the transmission still went out"
MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,zzyzzx2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:51:07 2015 UTC,"Whatever you buy, you need to have it inspected by a qualified mechanic before you lay your money down.  You also need to realize that any cheap old used car is going to need work.  #3 should have never been bought and wouldn't have been if you had a prepurchase inspection done.  #1 and #2 you should have fixed instead of giving up and throwing them away.  If you're just going to give up at the first sign of trouble you need to buy a much newer used car with a factory warranty still in place."
MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,waynep712222,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"If you're just going to give up at the first sign of trouble you need to buy a much newer used car   I'm at a point now where I'm excited to work on these things, and I'm up to the task of spending many hours/months on fixing something up, learning about it, etc. Like I said, I just finished fixing up two dead old Vespas and a 40 yr old moped, and those were pretty extensive projects. Now I'm ready to move on to a car. Until about a year ago, I had 0 interest in mechanical things, but then I started learning and I found that it's a lot of fun for me, and I really like a challenge and learning about this stuff. I find myself online doing research on parts & tips (for the moped and scooters I mean).   To be fair, I wasn't in a position at the time to want to deal w/ fixing up those other cars. With the Pontiac, I was in school, broke, and super busy. With car #1, we were moving around the country and unemployed, and I ended up buying a cheap used scooter to get around once we lost that car (the expedition). The expedition wasn't worth it, we lost $2500 by selling it for only $1000, but the parts would have been around $2000, even from a junkyard (I had several junkyard quotes, and those parts aren't cheap). Also, we were about to move again, so we needed to unload it.  Is it normal w/ a third party to take it to a mechanic? How do you go about that? Do you tell them they need to take the car to a mechanic of your choice and who pays that bill? The potential buyer I assume? That is good advice, I will definitely follow for the next car purchase. I have an idea of what to look for w/ a truck purchase, and I'll have a checklist w/ me, plus I'll pay to have it taken to a good mechanic.   Car #1 was inspected by a mechanic AFTER we bought it (mistake right there), but they said it was fine and didn't need any work. About 5k miles later, transmission went out. I think this was bad luck or something, even if we'd gone to a mechanic first, we wouldn't have made a different decision. Car #2 was inspected by a mechanic, and I knew it needed about $1k in work done on it. The overheating could have been fixed, honestly it wasn't that bad, but I was broke and in school, so I got rid of it for a bicycle. Was pretty cool w/ bucket seats, I liked that one. I think it was a 1991 Firebird w/ like 100k (had it around 2003?) Car #3 -- I'll never let my wife buy another car, she just thinks something is cool and doesn't use her brain. She was so hooked on buying a VW Golf. On top of it being a worthless rust bucket, she paid $2500 for a car I believe was worth like $500 at best, which I got onto her about later. She bought it from some dude who had kept it out in the open all those years, and the frame was totally rusted to hell. She never took it to a shop even after buying, it wasn't until the thing started having problems that we took it to a VW shop, and they said it was toast and ready for the scrap heap."
MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,cptboring,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'm also wondering how difficult it really is to do these jobs: blown head gasket, transmission work, engine work, and A/C compressor. Having never done car work, only mopeds and scooters, I don't know how involved it will be. My concern is that getting out the engine is a massive undertaking, involving hundreds of small parts, dozens of parts that need to be torqued, expensive and specialized tools, etc. I don't mind doing projects, I'm just wondering about how difficult it is realistically for someone w/ minimal experience to take on these projects. It seems like w/ older cars, these four repairs will be common/necessary."

I've been working on cars for something like 35 years and there are some repairs that are 'thirty seconds with a wrench' and other repairs that can take serveral days or weeks. Personally I started doing simple things, changing spark plugs, swapping alternator or starters.  Then, over time, as needed have tackled more involved jobs rebuilding power steering racks, alternators, carbs, engines, etc.  Also over time, have learned about computer-controlled systems, circuits, electronics, and all that stuff.

MechanicAdvice,3deuxn,BryceAnderson1998,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. I learned on the moped and scooter, I've done carb rebuilds, clutch rebuild, engine timing, replacing cables and spark plugs, installing new cylinder and head, new exhaust, plug chop for jet sizing. None of it seems that difficult to me, that's why I'm ready to tackle car projects.  My plan would be to start simple and work up from there. I'd ideally get a running car that needs some work, then slowly go through all the systems, take things apart, and put them back together. That's what I did w/ the moped/scooter, replaced all gaskets, went through everything down to replacing ball bearings. Even an engine rebuild isn't too bad.   cars are held together with nuts and bolts, you just gotta figure out what is bolted to what.   It seems more difficult than that, but w/ enough years of experience I feel I could learn. It's just a bit of a gamble, I do need a reliable car for work, so I'd need to get something used that runs, but that I can also work on myself. My fear would be getting something where I'm overwhelmed and can't fix it quickly. I thought about getting two old cars for this reason, so if one breaks down I can have the other one."

MechanicAdvice,3dc6tx,ratamack,2,Wed Jul 15 09:27:59 2015 UTC,"One important detail about Honda engines is that there is a coolant air-bleed screw. Trapped air makes it overheat. Also make sure the correct (Honda blue) coolant is used. Wrong coolant will shorten life of waterpump.    When timing belt was replaced, ideally they should have replaced crankshaft and camshaft oil seals, those can leak.  If the timing belt is not installed properly, such that the camshaft or balancer shafts were not at the correct position when the timing belt was put on, that can cause vibration.  (Some honda engines have balancer shafts and some do not). In either case, if the cam/crank timing are off a bit, the engine will run roughly and/or vibrate. When changing the timing belt, one of the rubber engine mounts can get broken. These do tend to crack over time, and since the lower crank pulley bolt on honda tends to be extremely tight, changing the timing belt can result in one or more broken engine mounts, which causes vibration. also it's possible a vacuum line was knocked loose such that the engine is running a bit rough."

MechanicAdvice,3dch8d,Teranek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:46:55 2015 UTC,"They're filthy, but I can't see anything in the photos that constitutes scrapping the engine. Check the camshaft lobes for wear once clean. You will want everything cleaned, and the head measured for flatness, and machined if they recommend it. Buff the cylinder block to remove crap and old gasket. Check for spots where coolant or water has corroded material away.  If it's just the gasket that went, and it was recent, there shouldn't be much if any corrosion or eaten away material.  For putting it all back together, you will need the service manual and a torque wrench, and a decent socket set + breaker bar, and feeler gauges. The service manual will include wear limit specs for various parts. Depending on the age, you may need to do the piston rings as well. Valve clearances will need doing if the head is shaved. When putting everything back together, you will need to observe the timing marks and make sure the crank and cams are at top dead centre for cylinder #1, on the compression stroke.  Also, buy a helicoil or timesert kit in case any studs are stripped.  All up, it will cost you less in parts but probably more in time."

MechanicAdvice,3dclcp,saberman00,2,Wed Jul 15 05:29:48 2015 UTC,"Have you done any work to your own vehicles as a hobby or anything? Getting a job as a mechanic fresh out can be very rough between school and tooling costs and many people don't last long since it takes a long time to get to where you make any money, are always pushing against rate times, and at times is very demanding of a person physically and mentally.  If it is something you are interested in then starting at a chain shop doing oil changes/etc is a good way to get some experience, but it won't teach you the troubleshooting skills that a good tech needs to have. Personally, I think a lot of people who get out of tech schools wasted a lot of money to get taught how to be a dealerships go-to bitch learning how to read a troubleshooting diagram out of a book and how to do an oil change, not things like knowing how to tell if a circuit is ground or power side switched, if you really DO need to remove this part to get that part or if that's just the way the service writer decided to do it, how to deal with rusty fastners, etc. Having some actual experience and being forced to learn from your mistakes way is way better for you, the shop, and the customer (IMO) but you have to either have enough experience already not to drown as soon as you get a tough job or better be a damn fast learner and persuasive with shops to give you a chance without formal training or experience."

MechanicAdvice,3dcjx0,gallant_justin,2,Wed Jul 15 05:14:41 2015 UTC,"I would not run it like that, cooling systems are under a fair amount of pressure and with a large surface area such as the pump is it needs to be kept in place so the seal doesn't break/leak. The bolt is reasonably accessible and if it broke when you were going in then it should come out easily without the stress of torque on it."

MechanicAdvice,3dcjx0,sunflashmace7,3,Wed Jul 15 13:30:36 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of ways to get it out, but honestly I feel you should have it towed to a shop. If you really feel like tackling this yourself you could try drilling a hole in the bolt itself, and using a tap kit to remove the broken bolt. You need to be extremely careful doing this. If you break the tap or mess the threads up too much you're making several more hours of work for yourself. My honest recommendation is take it to a shop. If you break the tap or damage the threads more you are likely going to have to pay more to get it fixed. As it is you're looking at a couple of hours labor from a shop in my opinion. Best of luck to you, and as a side note bolts should be threaded in gently as much as possible. Some jobs don't allow for this, but I don't grab the torque wrench until I'm ready to snug them all down at the end. If you have a lot of resistance it's usually best to back the bolt out, and check for damaged threads."
MechanicAdvice,3dcjx0,DropTopGSX,2,Wed Jul 15 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you get lucky and if you remove the pump you can grab the top of the bolt with a vice grips or something, otherwise you can use a small punch hitting it off-center to spin it out enough to get a pliers on it. If that doesn't work then drilling with a reverse drill bit and/or using an easy-out are options as well.   I am leaning to agree with /u/sunflashmace7 though, you may very well be in over your head and should take it to a pro. But definitely don't run it like it is."

MechanicAdvice,3dccsm,FlyinJimElbows,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"There are generally 3 interlocks involved in the shifter of an AT car. The first is the one that doesn't allow you to shift it out of park without the key in ""run"", the 2nd is the one that doesn't allow the shifter to move unless your foot is on the brakes, and the 3rd is the actual push button on the shift lever itself.  Can you remove the key with the shifter suck in R? If so then I would suspect something with the ignition interlock, if not then either a problem with the shift knob or the brake lockout. Check to make sure that your brake switches are in place and that all your brakes/blinkers work correctly. You should be able to start the car by shitting into nuetral to get the car moving, there is generally no interlock between N and D so you can quickly and safely remove power to the drive wheels in the event of loss of control.

Second of all, the always on compressors use a variable displacement design that will essentially vary the load on the engine depending on demand. So while it is always running, it is constantly varying it's load. On average, you should not find much difference between orifice and txv setups."
MechanicAdvice,3dcckx,eyephone314,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:42:50 2015 UTC,"So running a system with an orifice tube at a lower blower speed could save engine power/gas because the compressor is allowed to cycle on and off   Depends.  There are lots of systems on the road with an orifice tube and variable displacement compressor where the compressor never cycles off.   with a TXV, the compressor is always running   If the compressor is variable displacement, then yes, that is true.  Of course as the compressor lowers its displacement it draws less HP from the engine...  Bottom line is, for best MPGs, just turn the A/C off and keep the windows rolled up."

MechanicAdvice,3d9sky,ZMan524,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:16:35 2015 UTC,"From my experience, the knocking noise after startup is from the pressurized crankshaft bearings not yet having oil pressure. When the engine sits for an extended period of time, the oil will drain out of the crankshaft oil passages and bearings,  and back into the oil sump. It can take a couple seconds for the oil pressure to be built up upon startup, causing a knocking noise as the bearings ""slap."" If this is an older/higher milage engine, this is most likely the cause.  Some would recommend to use a more viscous oil, or put Lucas oil additive in the oil sump. I'm not sure if that would be a good idea, maybe someone with more experience could chime in?"

Could happen to any model car I guess. You may be surprised at the number of Toyotas and Hondas I've seen towed in on a rollback with a rod sticking out the side of the block and only a little over 100k miles. They not as great as the magazines make them out to be. 09 probably has variable cam timing, I don't know what type of noise that would make though. If phaser goes bad on most the noise is constant at idle. I'm thinking the pickup screen is clogged and it's having trouble picking up the oil. Some cars require an oil filter with a check valve builtin. Make sure you got a high quality or Toyota oil filter."

You may be able to find a used car dealer who'd repair it to sell but I doubt they'd give you much more money. Still you can call around and ask. You said the 6,600 parts/labor was even so at cost they're looking at 3,500 to get it sellable plus whatever they pay the mechanic. At 8k bluebook I don't see anyone really wanting to go that deep into it, but someone else who works for a used car dealer may be able to give you a better opinion.

I don't have any pictures onhand unfortunately, the radiator was recessed down the middle from where the bumper of the truck impacted, pushed it back probably 3-6 inches. I didn't get an itemized list of parts yet, but the shop said radiator/mount/AC chain, along with the body parts. They found a perfect donor, rear ended Mariner but 3.5 for the front clip considering I don't need anything but the rad/hood/lights just seems excessive, as does the labor cost."

Dealer has some stuff to put directly on the pad to stop this noise - you can't buy it in parts stores. Rotors may need replacing too, they can cause noise. Cheap or wrong type of brake pads can cause this."
MechanicAdvice,3db5x4,fisherop,3,Tue Jul 14 22:27:18 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of this happening before, but that doesn't mean it hasn't. Anything mechanical has the possibility to fail. I'm sure the this question has been asked many times before, but is it possible she didn't actually hit the brake pedal? I have a feeling that each shop that looked at it did a brief inspection and were convinced that she just didn't hit the brake pedal.  I would recommend you take it to the dealer. What I would personally do my self if this happened to me, is completely inspect the entire brake system. I would look at my rotors and pads for material and uneven wear, or certain wear behavior. I would inspect all of the brake lines and calipers for damage and deformities. I would inspect the brake pedal and make sure the push rod is properly aligned with the booster. I would inspect the brake booster and all the vacuum hoses connected to it. And I would inspect the master cylinder and brake fluid.   The only reasons I can see this happening is if the brake rotors were briefly contaminated with a lubricant, the rotors got too hot to stop the vehicle. The abs module completely closed all the solenoids and didn't allow any pressure to go to the calipers. Or the master cylinder bypassed the pressure back into the resivoir."

I should have been more clear in the original post. The ""shops"" were Nissan dealerships. The most recent one spent ~3 hours looking at it, so at least that one was not dismissive. Don't know how much time she spent at the other places, though.   The only reasons I can see this happening is if the brake rotors were briefly contaminated with a lubricant, the rotors got too hot to stop the vehicle.   Does heat matter here?

MechanicAdvice,3db5x4,polkabats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"Not really ambient temperature, but the temperature created from hard braking. If the brakes are applied repetitively, dragged, or are in a serious braking event, the brakes can heat up so much that the coefficient of friction between the pad and rotor is so low that the car will not stop."
MechanicAdvice,3db5x4,shaqed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:06:21 2015 UTC,Is this true? I thought the excessive heat causes the fluid to boil making the pedal spongy from the gas in the lines.
MechanicAdvice,3db5x4,polkabats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:24:39 2015 UTC,"Old contaminated fluid has the possibility to boil. But in a healthy brake system, heat induced brake fade is possible and more likely."

Transient brake failures that cannot be reproduced or identified are reported quite often. Nearly without exception, they are determined to be driver error. It isn't literally impossible to have such a failure, but it's so unlikely that you should at least consider the possibility that there's not really anything wrong with the car.   That said, if I were in your situation, I'd keep looking for a mechanical source for the problem. If there is one, you definitely want to find it. But be prepared to find nothing."
MechanicAdvice,3db5x4,polkabats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. That's why I said that's what I would personally do. If I'm convinced that I hit the brake pedal, I'll search every corner of that car looking for a reason before coming to terms that I just missed. I probably am being too cautious but I don't like to mess around with safety. Really the best thing to do is take it to a mechanic that is well trusted. They won't send out a car that would be dangerous on the round with out alerting the customer.

MechanicAdvice,3db5x4,polkabats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:40:15 2015 UTC,This wouldn't be my first thought. If it were air then she would have had multiple events like this not just one.

It's not to unusual in summertime freeway traffic to do this, especially if your being aggressive. Have the brake fluid replaced and bled and consider upgrading the brake pads to a ceramic material.

MechanicAdvice,3db2vs,mechanic_help_,3,Tue Jul 14 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"year and model would greatly help.   That being said, it really depends on where you took it. Did you take it to a transmission specialist, or somewhere that works on Fords? There's always a chance you run into some sort of freak failure or imperfection that is causing a lot of headache when it comes to fixing the problem. It's going to happen, very rarely though.  The other issue is whether they are competent enough. I for one can understand that they are losing money on this repair, having it come back a year later and have to be completely tore apart. However as a business owner, sometimes you have to bite the bullet and get the car out of there for the sake of keeping the customer happy. After a couple of fucked up attempts at fixing it, I would have ordered a rebuilt one or used one from a junkyard and had it installed. Or if it's cheaper, send it out to someone that knows what they're doing. We're obviously all human and can't know ever single mark,model, transmission, engine, and whatnot, but when you dont know how to do something, and you were given reasonable time to figure it out, and STILL cant figure it out, it's time to give it to someone who has the answers.   Try and ask to see what's going on with it, see if they can try and explain to you what the problem is, ask if they'll cover the expense of renting you a car for the time being. Tread lightly, if you're too blunt they may throw that project on the back burner, then you're really fucked. Just try and push them little by little."

When I received it the first few times, the gear select was off and another time my driver side tie rod wasn't fully tightened. That scared me."

MechanicAdvice,3db2uq,gruush,2,Tue Jul 14 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"things that come to mind are the motor mounts. They will cause a lot of shaking upon engagement of the clutch. Usually some shaking, maybe even a little noise. There are usually 3 or 4 mounts, one in the front, and two, one on each side, theyre made of rubber, look at them if theyre not too buried in there. Aside from that, it could also be a warped flywheel, it'll feel like the clutch pulsates when it's engaging, back and forth movement when letting off the clutch pedal slowly."
MechanicAdvice,3db2uq,swolemechanic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for your feedback... It doesn't seem flywheelish from what you describe. Clutch seems pretty normal. I'm leaning towards what the other people are mentioning about brake rotors. (Not that I know anything!)
MechanicAdvice,3db2uq,Pops__Racer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"Warped brake rotors will make the car vibrate when you slow down. Try slowing down while leaving the transmission in neutral. If the problem goes away, you may have a problem in your clutch or flywheel."
MechanicAdvice,3db2uq,Pops__Racer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"So, if the problem goes away in neutral, it's clutch/flywheel. If it's still a problem, it's maybe brake rotors?"

MechanicAdvice,3d8pja,Tiwilager,8,Tue Jul 14 11:15:06 2015 UTC,That sounds like the bearing on something belt driven is failing.  Usually the idler pulley(s) or alternator.  First thing I would do is remove the belt and start it to see if the noise went away.  If it does spin each device by hand to see which one is causing the issue and replace.
MechanicAdvice,3d8pja,imprl59,2,Tue Jul 14 12:17:26 2015 UTC,Sounds like real damage is being done. Best guess is the timing tensioner or cam sprocket/phaser. It's probably going away when the oil gets warm enough to start flowing so that rules out alternator or any belt related pulleys and it sure doesn't sound like the bottom end.
MechanicAdvice,3d8pja,Pops__Racer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"Do you think it could be the timing chain tensioner? or the timing chain itself? I could probably replace the tensioner, but I doubt I could do the chain myself."

Make sure it's not that dirty. I'm still more concerned with the mileage, please make sure to alway add it to your posts, especially with Subarus, since at around 80-100k they end up needing new head gaskets. They will leak from the bottom, usually get on the exhaust and make a weird smell.  Anyways, assuming you stick your head underneath and everything looks fine. Turn your car on, let it idle and get up to temperature, make sure the cooling fans cycle on and off, make sure they do it a couple of times. This will take a while, but do it. Next turn on the a/c and make sure the fans turn on automatically when you turn the a/c on, as they're intended to. It could be your overloaded the car, but if you said you were still cruising just fine, then I doubt that was the problem. Look for the obvious like shit stuck in front of the radiator, blocking air flow."

MechanicAdvice,3da3dl,swolemechanic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:01:07 2015 UTC,"sounds like we've found the problem. double check and make sure the a/c button is on, as well as the blower motor is on (it sounds stupid, but just to make sure, since I cant check over a computer)   If they do not come on, open the underhood fuse box and look for the cooling fan relay. it may or may not be labeled, there also may be a fuse for it. check the fuse. Find the relay and swap it with another one that has the same part number on the side of it. Also give it a good shake and make sure it's not really damaged. Then recheck. If you can't find the cooling fan relay, let me know. If you find it and swapped it and the fans still wont work, we're looking at a bigger problem, possibly bad fan motors or wiring. Both of these can be checked, but lets take it one step at a time.   to reiterate: Open underhood fuse/relay box. Find cooling fan relay or ""fan relay"", there also may be a fuse. check the fuse. Pull the relay swap with a similar relay that's not so important (headlight, hazard, turn signal...NOT a/c relay, defeats the purpose) Post back with results."

It doesn't activate the rad fan (I'm not sure if they're connected on this specific vehicle actually).   I also noticed the fan wasn't plugged in at all. Which is weird. I plugged it in but the problem persists.   The fuses look good. I can't seem to get the fan relay out however. It's stuck there (unless there's a specific way to remove them that I don't know about?). Even if I could, I don't have a spare one to test (it's bigger than all the other relays).

It will also be disconnected. Go ahead and connect it. This will make the car go into diagnostic mode(this is the d-check connector ) All solenoid and electric actuators will now start clicking and working, the fans should too. If they still don't work.

If the thing tears in a week or has problems going up and down you don't want to be stuck in the middle of the shop blaming the manufacturer and the other way around.    The zipper was so you could let the glass part down without lowering the whole top.  No one ever used them and if you tried then they broke but if it doesn't have that it isn't ""right"" and chances are very good that he wants it to be as correct as possible.    Also be aware that you'll need new bolsters on the inside of the top.

MechanicAdvice,3d9no8,Gaashura,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"GM has service bulletin on these no start problems that involve multiple circuits. They blame it on ""fretting"" corrosion inside electrical connectors. The terminals rub against each other and give off a metallic dust that scrambles electrical signals. The fix is to open each connector, wipe out with a nylon brush and apply a light film of dielectric grease. It's been a pretty big problem for them.   The key is to attach a scan tool and check the condition of each module. If you get no communication or a data trouble code, that's where GM wants you to start the diagnosis.   It takes time to locate and disassemble each connector, but cost is nothing--just a tube of dielectric grease and a nylon brush. Much cheaper than a new ECU"

You may have to block the Overflow outlet. Start engine for 15 seconds. If depression in sandwich wrap inflates perform a cylinder leak down test using a compression tester hose with the valve core removed. If bubbles appear in cooling system or wrap inflates. Head gasket time.  Did the thermostat get changed out as a failed thermostat will cause temp spikes..

MechanicAdvice,3d9ppa,rogerizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:43 2015 UTC,You can get a simple catback exhuast that will be fine. Unless you buy an oem muffler most catbacks will have slightly larger pipe and a slightly louder muffler that will slightly flow better. You might see a .5-1 mpg gain depending on how restrictive your old one was and how well the ecu adapts to the higher flow. It's an easy project to do and you'll just want to soak all of the bolts in pb blaster for a night to help break them loose.
MechanicAdvice,3d9ppa,Omgninjas,0,Tue Jul 14 17:03:29 2015 UTC,Chances are its so rusty they are going to have to use a torch to heat the bolts to get them out. Id pay to have someone do it.
MechanicAdvice,3d9ppa,CJM8515,0,Tue Jul 14 16:34:07 2015 UTC,Unless it was driven exclusively in the winter up north that probably won't be the case. Most muffler bolts will come off by being soaked in pb blaster. If they're really tough a torch will probably need to be used.
MechanicAdvice,3d9ppa,Omgninjas,2,Tue Jul 14 16:58:00 2015 UTC,It depends really. Mufflers will rust due to all the condensation they carry. At least around here your not getting those bolts off without an oxy/acetylene torch and there is a good chance you need to torch them off Perhaps if you live somewhere like the south or midwest maybe you can it by hand as there might be little to no rust.
MechanicAdvice,3d9ppa,CJM8515,2,Tue Jul 14 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"Very true, just letting op know that you don't have to torch them all off unless they're a rusted mess. Really he'll have to just look and see how bad it is."

MechanicAdvice,3d9ppa,Omgninjas,2,Tue Jul 14 17:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yes that would work. If you're going to go replace the muffler with one made for your make model that has the correct mounting points then bolt on is fine. If you're going to cut out the old one you can get clamps that work, but welding is better in that situation."
MechanicAdvice,3d9ius,DiddleMeDee,2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:42 2015 UTC,There is a switch on the fuse box that shuts off some circuits which could cause the battery to drain if you left the car for a long time.

You need 5 things for a car to start. Air, fuel, spark, compression and proper timing.  Check those first then you will have a direction to go in.  Check your distributor, civic distributors of that generation have been known to randomly fail.  Check the thermostat ground, this can cause a no start condition and is often overlooked.  Check your fuses, all of them, under the dash and under the hood, check them closely, they can look good but still be blown.

The oil on the inside isn't anything huge to worry about now, but keep an eye on it, it could spell trouble in the future. The internal seals of the distributor are wearing out and if they wear out enough the shaft in the distributor can begin to wobble and the rotor will catch one of the points and just shred ecerything. I've actually had this happen to me, it's not fun."
MechanicAdvice,3d7iay,agrippaz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:09:44 2015 UTC,They relays were not as big an issue after 93-94 as they were before. And just randomly saying to resolder a part that you have no information is bad is pointless.

I agree that tire size is the most likely culprit it is very common for people to put larger tires on trucks. Your tire should have a number similar to ""p255/70r16"" on the sidewall this is the tire size, if you post that number we should be able to determine if they are the correct diameter."

MechanicAdvice,3d7dgx,robshookphoto,3,Tue Jul 14 02:26:11 2015 UTC,from what i can see that ignition lock cylinder is also used on the BENZ models.. so you may be stuck at a dealership or a professional locksmith shop who specializes in automotive for help..  benz sued all the aftermarket lock providers a few years back.. forced them all to stop carrying aftermarket replacement components. i did see a lock cylinder assembly for around 100 bucks at an online parts provider.. who knows what you will have to pay..  and you really should fix it before it totally breaks..   if you have AAA.. they will have automotive lock specialists available who only work on cars and trucks..   in other dodge vans and cars.. there are replacement lock cylinders that come with pins to match your key.. usually with those you can actually take it apart and file the tumblers slightly to remove the burrs.. so the lock does not bind or jam..
MechanicAdvice,3d7dgx,waynep712222,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:28:43 2015 UTC,You can try graphite powder that's sold in a tube to lubricate the inside of the cylinder (graphite being the only safe lube for lock cyls). Replacing the lock cylinder may be easy once you find the locking pin. See if your local parts store has a new one in stock and find the locking pin  that you push in to remove the cylinder. Look for the pin on your car. It's usually just a matter of pushing the pin with a small pick and turning the key to the on position and it pops right out.
MechanicAdvice,3d6h0b,nik27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:11:06 2015 UTC,that is the EGR feed tube..  the tube connections on that feed the EGR back pressure transducer.. there is usually less than a pound or a pound and a half of pressure in that even with the throttle wide open..  you have a restriction in the exhaust.  blocked cats... melted cats... ash blocking the cats sometimes happens..  could also have a potato up the  tail pipe.. but this is reddit.. its probably a banana up the tail pipe.. quite litterally.   you can visit a wrecking hard for replacements or order a this.. http://www.dormanproducts.com/itemdetail.aspx?ProductID=27785&SEName=46019  put a pressure gauge on that hose fitting one that reads a max of 15 or 30 pounds..  make sure the clamps are tight.. start the engine.. you should NOT have over 1.5PSI at high rpms.. please make sure that you are watching the gauge.. as if you pop that hose off at high engine speed.. you could actually have 1600 to 2000F air coming out that tube opening melting or catching anything on fire..

The hose does tend to pop at high speed/acceleration as I drive on the highway everyday. Also the air emitting from the opening was very hot just running at idle when I checked it the first time. Could some type of cleaning at a Jiffy Lube place help or is it to the point of needing to take it into a mechanic and start replacing parts?
MechanicAdvice,3d6h0b,waynep712222,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:50:35 2015 UTC,have the cats inspected.. they are clogged..  you can also hook a vacuum gauge to intake manifold vacuum and slowly increase the engine speed.. the manifold vacuum should not drop as you increase the speed.. if it drops you have a restricted exhaust.  there are a bunch of videos on it.. https://youtu.be/4QvR5Nqun4g
MechanicAdvice,3d6h0b,jamesmech,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that what you're looking at is a fuel hose. It, more likely, is a hose that goes from the EGR tube to the DPFE sensor, which monitors exhaust backpressure, which allows the PCM to make decisions about regulating EGR flow. The hose clamp could help, but the hoses should be replaced with the factory ones, that are made of a high temperature silicone. New hoses should fit tightly to these nipples. The hose coming off usually doesn't affect fuel mileage, but is necessary to help the engine reduce NOX emissions. I'm curious as to whether there is a Check Engine light. Usually this will set an EGR code. Also, the hose might be coming off to to excessive exhaust back pressure from a restricted exhaust component."

Most cars have a pressure switch that will turn the AC off once the pressure dips below a certain point on the low side of the system (approx. 20 psi); this is done as a preventative measure to prevent damage to the compressor.  What's most likely happening in your car is that the pressure is dropping below a certain point and the compressor will turn off (you will hear a relay click most likely).  A few seconds later the pressure will build back up and the compressor will turn back on, but the operation of the compressor will cause an immediate pressure drop, and the cycle will repeat itself.  Your system is undercharged with refrigerant.  This could be due to an incorrect charge out of the factory, or a part of the system could be damaged, and refrigerant may be leaking from the system.  Take it back to them and if they can't see any obvious damage/leaks, they will most likely recharge the system with refrigerant and a special dye.  This dye will make it easy to detect leaks if they happen again.  If it doesn't leak anymore after getting it recharged, then it was most likely just underfilled from the factory  Good luck.  EDIT:  Also, make sure they document everything, even if it's just a five minute fix."

Cops don't settle payment disputes  Do I pay it and sue?  That's one option. Not the best.  The best option is to contact the Attorney's general's consumer affairs department in your state and get a quick lesson on the laws regarding estimates and repairs. The laws vary from state to state.   Then ask the consumer affairs person what help they offer in a case like this and what their advice is.  Then contact the service manager at the shop. Do not talk to the service writer. Go right to the service manager. Tell the SM that you've talked to the AG's office and they're willing to get involved if needed (if that;s true) and then recite the laws regarding estimates. Explain how you didn't approve of those repairs and that you don't want this to wind up in court, but you're prepared to do that if the shop doesn't follow the law.  Then, if the shop offers a compromise, TAKE it. You don't want this to go to court. You'll be without your car for a long time, your life will be a mess.

MechanicAdvice,3d7smp,CleverNameAndNumbers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:31:34 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter. Ontario law says that the final bill cannot exceed the estimate by more than 10% unless both parties agree beforehand, which you didn't. I would inform them of this law, tell them that you were never informed about these things and that you will not pay more than the estimate plus 10%.   That said if you can talk to their manager. If the tech is a dumbass the manager will take care of it. If they keep insisting you pay the bill then I'd find a lawyer to consult with. I'd ask this question on /r/legaladvice."

If you don't pay a mechanic what they are asking, they can put a lien on your vehicle and take it from you to pay the debt.  You have to pay, then go after them later.  I'm in a position that I can pay, and have the freedom to go to court whenever I choose without losing pay.  Few people are in my situation though.    I sorted it out with him today and payed him $900.  The things he did to the car were needed.  He showed me the old parts, and had he told me ahead of time I would have probably agreed."
MechanicAdvice,3d7smp,waynep712222,2,Tue Jul 14 22:47:55 2015 UTC,do you have your copy of the estimate.. that you signed.. agreeing to the 390 bucks.   what state are you in... do you have AAA... they have lawyers on staff for members to have these kind of issues..   if work was done without your approval..  you usually don't have to pay for it..  warning they may take the parts back off your car.. or at least try to.. and you should pay with a CREDIT CARD not cash..  not a debit card..  with a credit card you can always dispute the charges ..   be sure the invoice is complete.. and if you can snap an image of the estimate.. don't give your copy back to them.  if you are in california.. you will be in better shape than some other states.   you should also check the shops online complaints.. like at yelp..  like at the state autoshop license division.  in california that would be the department of consumer affairs.. bureau of auto repair.   do you have your written estimate copy.. we usually don't handle these kinds of issues on this forum.

MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,Komplete_Bullshit,4,Mon Jul 13 19:17:02 2015 UTC,"We do a thing called a leakdown test. We couldn't get you pictures. A leakdown test can verify if valves are bent or  not by applying compressed air through the spark plug hole for that cylinder with the valves in the closed position. If air comes out the intake with the intake valve closed, problem with intake valve. Air comes out exhaust? Problem with exhaust valve. A small amount of leakage is considered OK."

MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,CALLAHAN_AUTO-PARTS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:05:45 2015 UTC,This 100x's. A leakdown will tell if the valves are sealing and they should have done it first after confirming a broken belt. I believe the DOHC 2.0l can be interference in those years but all the SOHC should be non interference.
MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,reboticon,5,Mon Jul 13 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"According to Gates, the largest manufacturer of OE timing belts in the world, your ZX2 is in fact an interference engine."
MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,Iceheart721,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all I've seen are conflicting opinions :/  I've seen a boatload of testimonials from zx2 owners who just replaced the belt, no worries, and a lot of places that say it's non-interference.  Then there are others who say their engines are scrapped and places like gates who list it as interference. It's quite confusing. I'll just end up asking for pics of damage and see if I can look at it myself before throwing more money at it"
MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,reboticon,9,Mon Jul 13 20:56:35 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as an ""opinion"" on whether or not an engine is an interference style or not. Gates is the largest manufacturer of timing components and makes many of the parts manufacturers put on their cars and most of the time is the one who made an oe belt that's been rebranded. They make no profit off you buying a new engine, only a new belt. If they say it is an interference engine in your application it IS.  That being said, the opinion garbage you tend to see on forums is the result of dumb luck and chance. If a belt breaks at start up or with the valves in exactly the right position damage can be minimal. It still occurs but it may go unnoticed to an untrained eye or the car already has issues that cover it up.   For example if you have an engine thats already worn and tired a drop in compression due to a bent valve probably will go unnoticed. Or say your engine burns oil already a variation in consumption will probably be swept under the rug.  My point being your engine is damaged. There are no ifs ands or buts about it. There is no opinion, only fact. How bad it is will be up to the shop to discover. You can have them run some tests to see how bad it is. You can have them put on a new belt. You will have to pay for it either way reguardless off the result so keep that in mind. You might be lucky and be able to toss on a new belt and have no noticeable damage. Or you blow a few hundred bucks on a car you are going to send to the crusher. That will be up to you. I'm sorry if that seems harsh.  Every car can be checked for interference application. They are becoming more and more common. This is the precise reason why when someone asks me to look at a car, or I'm going to purchase one myself with higher mileage I check whether the engine is an interference type and what the change interval is. Then factor that cost into the price of the car and if I'm able to work it into the negotiations for price."
MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,reboticon,2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:38 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it's not a guarantee either way. Sometimes interference engines are fine. Some engines that are listed as Non Interference - like Dodge 2.4L - will actually interfere if the belt breaks at several thousand RPM. The pistons won't hit the valves on those, but the intake and exhaust valves can collide with each other."
MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,waynep712222,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was mid-highway around 3500 RPM when it snapped"
MechanicAdvice,3d5sbs,Trogdor_Jones,2,Mon Jul 13 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"Then there is a good chance of damage, unfortunately. I'd just talk to the shop. Ask them how they know the valves are bent. On first impression, they sound honest. I say this because to me the dishonest thing would be to sell you a timing belt. Then once you have paid for that, and your car won't run, or runs and has one or two dead cylinders, they can sell you more work. Work that would have included the timing belt to begin with. Essentially double dipping.  They may have done the leakdown test, I don't know of any other way they could know for sure the valves are bent. It's possible they are bluffing, because there is a good chance of interference at that RPM, or maybe they properly tested.  I got my current car after a guy on a cross state trip overheated. I suspected head gasket, did a leakdown test, called him in to show him air was bubbling from his radiator when applied to spark plugs. Clear proof. He didn't want to fix it and sold it to me cheap. IMO a shop should be fine with 'proving' their diagnosis, as long as the person asking isn't a dick about it."

However, it is common that a valve begins to leak once the system is serviced, as the rubber seal at the bottom of the valve remains undisturbed for years at a time. Opening the valve can unseat the small o-ring causing a leak. In this case, the only fix is to drain the system, replace the valve, pull a vacuum on the system and refill."

I would try changing the oil to something thicker like 15w-40 and see if that helps the pressure. Also if the pressure is too low it may be cutting the engine as the computer thinks its out of oil and cuts spark to kill the engine before it gets damaged. Guessing a series 1 3800 so check intake gaskets/pressure test cooling, check for coolant in oil or milkshake like sludge in the valve cover."

You are still fixing a $45000 car. So parts and labor adjust accordingly. I have owned many VW/Audi products over 100k miles and the amount of work needed was no more than other cars I have owned.

Take into account a 25k toyota camry basically just change the oil and put some tires and brakes on it and nothing brakes down. A friend of mine is a VW mechanic, he often says that if there isnt a CEL or MIL you got something to worry about on them lol.  I will rightfully admit that driving a german car is seriously much more refined than an an american or import. Handles way better and the turbos the vw has are sweet.

MechanicAdvice,3d5r9y,RickMN,2,Mon Jul 13 21:51:03 2015 UTC,high speed is usually powered by a relay..   excessive amp draw from the blower motor MAY cause the blower resistor to overheat and fail..  the blower motors actually run at least at a low speed as long as the key is on.. positive ventilation system to keep exhaust fumes out. i will look over at the wiring diagrams and see what i can see..  you may want to investigate the blower motor..    edit  if you have a blower resistor instead of a blower control module.. you have manual control ac system..  you will want to check the ground connector known as G200 if that is loose you will have reduced current to the blower motor and resistor..  you will want to print and perform this test.. not only with the engine running and the headlights on. but also with the blower motor in several speed positions..  http://i.imgur.com/WMDprhm.jpg    you will want to perform test 5 a second time with the blower motor at HIGH SPEED..  you only need to test this second time the underhood fuse block fuse labeled BLOWER..  post results to that..   with the blower motor speed switch an a medium speed other than HIGH.. test the fuse in the end of the instrument cluster fuse box labeled HTR-A/C   you may need to use a jumper cable to extend the positive battery cable to the where you are working.. please use extreme care to NOT touch that to the body.. when i do that i lay the jumper cable under the truck on the concrete. clipping that to one of my digital volt meter test leads to perform the voltage drop test..    on the blower motor. you have 2 wires.. a Purple wire that gets various positive voltages/currents to change speed..   and a black wire.. that is hooked to ground at G200.. which is under the dash..   please with your digital volt meter after you have performed the six part test under the hood.. perform this voltage drop test from the black wire into the blower motor to the body ground while the blower is in  medium or high speed.  i don't expect more than 0.2 volts.. that's 2/10ths of a volt..    why check the voltage drops.. because the drop in voltage because of resistance in the circuit will raise the current and cause things to burn out. .  you can see the wiring diagram for the manual controlled HVAC front blower control here.. http://i.imgur.com/pIO97aQ.jpg

MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,sunflashmace7,2,Tue Jul 14 03:21:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on price. I'd rebuild it completely since you never know how badly it was dogged on before you got it.

Plus there are too many turbo manufacturers for me to keep up with. I usually just find something in my customers price range, and depending on whether or not I've used the manufacturer before I'll give them a guesstimate on how long it should last them under normal wear and tear.  At the end of the day I'm usually putting a turbo on something that shouldn't have a turbo put on it, but they just have to have it. I almost never say no to money. I've only worked on a t4 once, and I don't really see them come into the shop I work at. So as long as you don't get the bottom of the barrel quality wise. I'm assuming it's like most things in cars where regular maintenance, and original quality defines the lifetime of the part."

MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,swolemechanic,2,Tue Jul 14 03:50:44 2015 UTC,"I recommend doing some reading up and deciding for yourself what turbo will best suit your needs, especially if you're considering going new.   https://www.turbobygarrett.com/turbobygarrett/turbo_tech_expert  It's a pretty good technical article on choosing the perfect turbo for your application. Anyone can tell you to grab a T3 Garret turbo from so and so model year, but you'll have a lot less problems tuning it in the end if you really do your homework. The problems that you're likely to run into by just picking a random turbo, are going to be air/fuel ratio while on boost, as some of these turbos reach peak boosts at different times, and you'll want that peak boost to match your shifting rpm. You run into problems with oversized turbos and excessive lag, often once it does end up reaching peak boost, you can lean out very quickly, causing a ton of damage throughout the engine. I also assume that you're going to want to slap this on and want the tuning to be more or less easy. Since your vehicle uses a mass airflow sensor you will have a lot more margin for error when it comes to throwing a turbo at it. The computer on your Disco will be able to compensate the air/fuel ratio to an extent. So you would at least be able to drive it to a shop with a dyno, and get the tune really dialed in."
MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,swolemechanic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"Lots of info, I appreciate this a lot. I'm in such a rural area, i don't even know where the nearest Dino is, much less the nearest 4 wheel dyno, so I really kind of have to do the tune at home.  I definitely want to stay small enough to avoid as much lag as possible since the truck is so reliant on low end torque.  I will definitely do my reading, thanks for all your advice. Much appreciated."
MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,swolemechanic,2,Tue Jul 14 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"I've known a lot of guys that slap turbos on their cars, never doing the research, just winging it. They get a fun little car for a month or so, then it decides on throwing a piston through the block because it kept pegging full lean at redline. Not good. Do yourself a favor and install a wideband O2 sensor, so you can at least dial in a rough tune at home. Always remember, it's better to be filthy pig rich(to an extent), than letting your mixture get lean at all.   Every second your engine sees a lean fuel mixture, you risk detonation, these small waves will destroy the upper end of your motor, and cause tiny heat spots to develop, too much time leaned out will literally melt your pistons to the block."
MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,swolemechanic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, I've heard plenty of that happening to people, which is exactly why I'm doing my research because this is my daily driver and I can't afford it to melt. Haha  I'll follow your recommendation and install a wide band O2.  Question, would it be easier to install a carburetor and an MSD ignition than to mess with the stock fuel injection? This was originally a Buick 215 engine, so you could get an edelbrock 4 barrel manifold and a 750 carb, then maybe a 6 or 7 series MSD box. Thoughts?"
MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,endmass,2,Tue Jul 14 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"No. You're blessed with a very simple fuel system to tune. Having to run a turbo through a carb is a nightmare as far as tuning goes. Just google turbo carburetor. With your old port injection, you'll be able to adjust injector pulse width pretty well, you may need larger injectors. But for the most part you'll be able to change numbers quickly when doing your tuning. Increasing pulse width(adding fuel) or decreasing(less fuel)"
MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,endmass,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for that then. Somebody else mentioned the SAFC2 wasn't good enough and that I needed atleast an AEM something which would control both fuel and spark, hence my confusion.  Another question, do I need a wide band O2 for each bank? I'm assuming yes. Will I also want to leave the narrow band O2s for the ECU to talk to? Also assuming yes, but I just want to double check."
MechanicAdvice,3d7enc,endmass,2,Tue Jul 14 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"The AEM EMS is a 1500 dollars engine management computer, basically a complete substitute for your current vehicles computer software, it can control everything but requires a lot of experience and access to a dyno. It would be nice to have it, and a lot of peoples opinions will be different on whether you need one or not. I myself wouldn't jump straight into a 1500 dollars software without at least first trying out the SAFC2. However, the SAFC2 is just a piggyback controller, it adjusts fuel, if you're looking to get the car to run well and drive-able on your daily driver, that would be the route to go first. Yes you'll need 2 wide band o2s, you could get away with one if both exhaust pipes unite relatively close to the engine, but I'd recommend not cheaping out, get 2 wide band o2s, leave the original o2s so the engines management system can still run,  and have the exhaust removed and install new o2 sensor bungs where you think they'll fit best in your exhaust, I know that once you go turbo, room becomes a tight commodity."

Even more so if it's a clunk that you can both feel and hear at low speed bumps/turns. It's a very infamous issue for 99-07 GM trucks and SUVs. Sivlerados seem to have gotten the worst of it.  GM put out several lube kits and I think a new ISS, none of which permanently address the issue, but makes it better for a short time. Heck, not even Dorman got it right on the first try. The ISS I linked in my post had a faulty original version many years ago, but they re-redesigned it and now they have the absolute best ISS for these vehicles.  It's a very easy and cheap fix for most, much better than the ""jack off your ISS"" temporary fixes that redistribute the grease within the shaft. For my particular truck, I had to remove the gas pedal to reach the ISS, but it was very easy as well.  Many models have the ISS within easy reach."

MechanicAdvice,3d4flt,Holeinmysock,6,Mon Jul 13 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like lack of coolant and you have a massive air pocket in your system.   Also never use rad caps that are temp gauges. Just don't work tbh. The rad cap is there to increase pressure in your cooling system (most common 1.1bar) so 14-15psi, and iirc raises the boiling point of your anti freeze by 45F.   You can defiantly try and do a proper flush and fill, get the air out and see how the engine is running. If you have aluminum heads for example those things are warped most likely. Happened to a LT1 rebuild I was doing.   Did you buy a OEM thermostat or aftermarket? Not many people do this but if you bought it, did you check if the valve opens in a bowl/bucket? If a shop did the work then they truely fucked up on flushing/filling/ getting air out of the system and I'd be up there ass"

MechanicAdvice,3d4a00,toadstule,11,Mon Jul 13 12:09:20 2015 UTC,WD-40 is not a good penetrating oil and isn't going to be all that effective to loosen those bolts. I would use a 1/2 inch ratchet instead of a 1/4 inch just because bumper bolts take a lot of torque to break loose. Having a shop do it might be the best route. They can use a torch to heat up the bolts so that they don't break. Depending on how rusty it is they may break bolts anyway and it must becomes a matter of would you rather fight with it or pay someone else to fight with it.
MechanicAdvice,3d4a00,Loves-The-Skooma,2,Mon Jul 13 12:28:49 2015 UTC,"I do not have tools to drill a bolt, so I definitely don't want to fight that fight. I feel like they will charge me less if I bring in the bolts still intact and they break them, then if I bring them in broken. I am not sure why I feel that way except that I read horror stories when I googled about broken bolts."
MechanicAdvice,3d4a00,iowamechanic30,4,Mon Jul 13 12:33:33 2015 UTC,They won't necessarily charge you more but if you bring it in already messed up the mechanic may not be very motivated and it may take longer. Since you'll be paying by the hour that may cost you more. If the mechanic breaks the bolts he won't be fixing someone else's screw up and will probably make better use of his time. Either way it's better to take it in before you break it than after.
MechanicAdvice,3d4a00,Buckid,13,Mon Jul 13 15:20:11 2015 UTC,PB blaster / penetrating oil.  WD 40 is not that. Spray it on Let it sit a half hour / overnight spray some more on try to loosen it.  Might need to heat the bumper to loosen.
MechanicAdvice,3d4a00,snowy247,2,Mon Jul 13 13:49:33 2015 UTC,"You don't want to break the bolts if you can help it. It's not going to be the end of the world, but it'll end up costing you more in the long run to extract them. You need to heat them up. Get yourself a blow torch and carefully heat the bolt (Make sure you wipe off the excess WD40 before you start). If you're not confident in doing this, then get a shop to heat them for you. Once they're hot they should start to move. Don't just undo them, work them in and out gradually coming further out.   Oh and use a 3/8 drive at least. If you broke your 1/4 extension then you don't want to break another."
MechanicAdvice,3d4a00,Omgninjas,2,Mon Jul 13 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"So are you saying trying a 3/8 drive probably won't break the bolts?

There should be a small reservoir on the firewall next to the brake fluid. If that's full or it's a mechanical system then your clutch itself is wore out and will need to be replaced.

I'm sure the inter-web has a video on how to bleed most typical hydraulic clutches that would be more comprehensive than I could give here. The main problem is why did it get low in the first place? You're going to want to look for leaks because there's not many ways for it too get low otherwise.

If your state has similar rules you could go through removing and capping off some unnecessary vacuum lines and replacing others that are important. You may even gain more power by doing so. Many of those lines are probably brittle, gooey, and cracking now due to age causing leaks that can interfere with the car's performance. You may also want to drain and refill the transmission fluid if you don't know when it was done last. I would be better if you also changed the transmission fluid filter when you change the fluid. DO NOT flush the transmission fluid. Just drain it and fill it."

You could also search terms like 1977 Cadillac emissions / smog delete to see if someone has already done a detailed write up of doing so on a forum or something. My 1983 BMW for example had a rats nest of emissions related vacuum lines that were not necessary so I removed most of them once I figured out what was and was not necessary and regained a little bit of power that was slightly noticeable.

MechanicAdvice,3d457w,freakame,5,Mon Jul 13 11:09:59 2015 UTC,changing the rear end gearing is probably the cheapest way to go. when you change the rear end ratio you are kind of trading acceleration for lower revs at highway speed. you will get better highway mpg but at the trade of having to bury the loud pedal under the floor to get out into traffic. If you have a decent amount of horsepower its not that bad and is probably the cheapest best option. If the motor feels under powered now with its current gearing then I would change the transmission. I'm going to assume that it's an automatic and most likely a th400 or th350 either way they are 3 speed automatics without overdrive. if you swap in a 700r4 you will have 4 speeds and that will have a lower first gear for easier starts and a higher final drive for lower rpm on the highway. having more speeds works the motor less and you should see an increase in fuel economy as well as a reduction in noise and it will feel less abusive when you are driving. As far as removing the dual wheels goes if you end up regearing the rear end then just swapping the rear axle with a single rear wheel axle of the appropriate width and gear ratio would be the way to go. assuming assuming used parts I bet parts and labor swapping the transmission is going to be the top side of your budget and swapping the rear end is going to be half of your budget or so
MechanicAdvice,3d457w,Loves-The-Skooma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you for the info!  Yes, it is an automatic.  It has plenty of power, it's just pushing into high RPMs, so I think it will be fine with a better rear end gear ratio.    I'll definitely look into getting a new rear axle with better gearing!"
MechanicAdvice,3d457w,Loves-The-Skooma,2,Mon Jul 13 13:01:21 2015 UTC,I would stick with the dual rear wheels and just regear your current axle if you feel like horsepower isn't a problem. two tires on each side adds stability you have more traction in case of slippery roads. the extra weight of the tires down low keeps the center of gravity low. two wheels per side helps spread the load out better so if you are going to camp on a beach or go to a campsite in a field you will be less likely to be stuck. you also have a safety net with the extra wheels. if you blow a rear tire on the road you can still drive it to a shop. the extra wheels are better to transfer the braking force to the road making you less likely to slide. I know that its more expensive to maintain the extra tires but you need to look at the big picture as well. those extra tires do more than allow you to carry extra weight.

I suspect it may require a rear end swap with the transmission.
MechanicAdvice,3d5lep,DaneboJones,2,Mon Jul 13 18:28:54 2015 UTC,"This problem is one that you really cant do too much on your own. Some people will tell you to shove a can of those ""recharge kits"" in there, but I'd rather you spend the money towards an hour of diagnosing the real problem you're having. It's likely you probably have a leak. Seeing as how your car has some age on it, it might be possible it's had dye put in it before, but at the very least it'll still have a/c oil in it. Look around all the A/C lines and fittings for dirt/dust build up on certain spots. Typically the front pulley of the compressor leak, the o-rings for both lines attaching to the compressor also leak, sometimes the actual fittings where you add freon may also leak. Sorry I can't be of much help, but I'd just hate for you to throw a can of freon in there and potentially make matters worse."

But if it's a leak on a pipe, you can jb cold weld over it, I've done that before. You can also just keep recharging if it's Economical to do so."

MechanicAdvice,3d3hi2,aNameHere,2,Mon Jul 13 06:35:53 2015 UTC,i agree with the others.. if you want to keep the fuel injection system and daily drivability keep it stock..   but you could find a 351W that was an option in that truck.. and buy the donor truck and swap the engine and harness right in along with the 351W radiator and fan shroud.  if you wanted to go bigger you could even do a 460 swap..  you do have to worry as the 94s came sometimes with a computer shifted transmission.. so that makes swapping harder.  have you noticed the price of gasoline is going up like crazy..  here in los angeles it went up like 50 cents over the weekend.   do depending on which transmission you have many choices.  you are asking a bunch of professional mechanics.. who see people swap engines that don't know anything except what their untrained buddys have told them and then they are UNHAPPY as it does not frigging work as well..   you have a 50EFI motor in that truck.  the 351W requires many changes in your parts.. its taller and wider so you will need to change the exhaust and some of the engine accessory brackets.  the intake won't fit. the computer won't fuel the larger motor properly.. your buddys will tell you to toss that smog pump. but without the smog pump it won't pass a EECIV self test so it will run in default mode and get horrible fuel economy and only about half power.. your friends will tell you to toss that EGR valve.. again .. the computer will be in default mode and reduce power and fuel economy.  or you could toss the electronic shift automatic.. and the fuel injection and install a carb that won't run at angles like the fuel injection does .. and won't get the fuel economy the fuel injection does.  do a LOT more research.. read up on your fuel injection system ..  describe better what your actual use is going to be for your truck.. and be very careful in your cam selection .. some are not compatible with electronic fuel injection..  i am not telling you not to swap.. i am just warning you from 35 years of experience that your description of what you want may not be realistic without a significant outlay of cash and time.
MechanicAdvice,3d3hi2,WorstNameOnReddit,2,Mon Jul 13 09:53:37 2015 UTC,"Bolt ons. Its the way to go. You can go to a scrap yard and get intake and heads from the same year explorer or mountaineer with a 302 (around $250-$300) and you have just upgraded your engine to almost a full 302 gt40. Add the right cam and it is basicly a 302 gt40. headers and  h-pipe exhaust. All day off road. Everyday. Mine is on this track now. I started with headers h pipe and 6 liter tune up. Drove it From Tx to NY and Back. She has 290,xxx miles. 302 is a beast. Not the fastest or the most HP engine. But Rock solid."

I'm still leaning towards doing a head swap from a v8 explorer. There's conflicting info about the gains it really provides but it seems like the best upgrade for the cost. Just keep looking around for info. The 302 has been around for a while so theres tons of info out there. Also check out the ""6 liter tune up"".

Was that engine ever offered with a manual transmission (in anything, not just your model LR)?  What country do you live in?  In the US, Rockland Standard Gear is the go-to source for swapping late model transmissions into older 4X4 vehicles.  I would recommend a hydraulic throwout bearing for ease of fitment. McCleod is one source.

When you get to the slope you can use your hand brake and let your feet off of the brake pedal and step on it again to shift it to park that way the hand brake is holding your car and not the pin inside the transmission. When you leave place the car in reverse first then release then hand brake

MechanicAdvice,3d208y,Danny_5000,3,Sun Jul 12 23:17:16 2015 UTC,Yup that way what holds your car in place is the hand brake and there shouldn't be tension on your transmission after that

MechanicAdvice,3d1w0z,waynep712222,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:23:57 2015 UTC,Its just the first step as if there is an unsceen problem with the wiring it will cause the computer memory to clear each time its cranked and it will forget where it should set the idle air control at. Making it hard to start. Cam you get it started and warmed up the set base idle. By unplugging the idle air control vale and adjusting the idle speed screw to as low an rpm it will gow without stalling and without the throttle plate sticking in the bore and going boing evert time you open the throttle. Then plug the idle air control back in bring the engine up to 2500 for 20 seconds and over 20 seconds more slowly return to idle. Let it idle for a minute shut off for 20 second then try a restart without touching the gas. If you have to touch the gas repeat the 2500 then slow return to idle.  Nect step is codes and examining the live data stream and checking for air leaks between the air flow meter and throttle body
MechanicAdvice,3d1w0z,waynep712222,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:40:13 2015 UTC,I can try that next time I'm with the truck. I have adjusted the idle screw to try to smooth it out but that alone didn't help. I don't think the computer memory gets cleared as I have the check engine light and it comes on instantly with the same codes unless I clear them. I don't have the scanner anymore so I can't look them up again. It was misfires of course resulting from the sputter under load.

Unless you're bad at using the clutch usually they can make it to at least 175k miles. My buddies first clutch change on a 97 civic was I believe the 270k mile range. With replacing the clutch you'd have to remove  your half shafts to your wheels, unhook the electrical harness to your transmission, unbolt your bellhousing from the engine and drop it out then its just remove bolts on the clutch and reassemble. Make sure reassembly is to the proper torque specs. If it's not you could cause catastrophic damage to the transmission or engine. Like I said though I doubt your clutch is bad its still youngish.

MechanicAdvice,3d11fo,waynep712222,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:18:16 2015 UTC,you will more than likely need to jack up the car and remove the right front wheel.. its been a long time since i did one and i don't recall the last few i did.. rarely have i not had to remove the right front wheel from a front wheel drive GM car to do the water pump.. only one i know would be a caddy with a northstar..  be sure you check the rubber on the harmonic damper.. that fails and the outer ring starts banging something fierce once in a while..
MechanicAdvice,3d11fo,waynep712222,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:14:40 2015 UTC,fuck those northstars.  everything about them.  only reason you wouldn't need to pull the right front wheel is the pump is on the other side!  don't need to take the wheel off on the 3100/3400 cars.
MechanicAdvice,3d11fo,302HO,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:07:06 2015 UTC,my point exactly..  pumps on the other side.
MechanicAdvice,3d11fo,waynep712222,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:12:53 2015 UTC,It doesn't list wheel removal in alldata but it does call for 3 hours (most water pumps pay less than 2). Taking the wheel off probably isn't required but I'm sure it makes some bolts easier to get to.

If your car working right (an not too old) you won't be able to take the key out of the ignition unless the car is in park.    IMO, you should get in the habit of setting the parking brake too.  Using the parking brake daily keeps the cables and linkage from seizing up."

MechanicAdvice,3d0xzx,waynep712222,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Even with everything mentioned by waynep71222, you're still likely a click from the pads having a little play in the caliper.

I had to replace both the clutch pedal switch and the brake pedal switch, maybe it's worth checking those! are your brake lights on constantly? Maybe the plunger on the switch is stuck. I'd assume your car is an automatic so the clutch pedal switch is probably not an issue.  If the brake pedal switch is not stuck, it's worth pulling it out and checking the resistances on it. They usually are a single switch with a 4 pin connector, one is a push to make, the other is a push to break, one controls the brake lights, the other tells your bcm that you're using the brake pedal.

Sparks is a good indication, but I would want to get a voltage reading on it before taking things apart. The mower blade is probably directly driven from the engine so you should be able to turn it over by hand and make sure the engine isn't seized. Try starting it with the spark plug removed, fuel or oil trapped in the cyl will prevent it from turning. If the engine turns and the battery has 12 volts, your probably looking at a bad starter, the click is telling me the switch is working. The starter should be simple to remove and test with jumper cables hooked to your car battery."

I had a seat switch go on my John Deere and it would try to turn over but nothing. You need to test for spark with a spark tester. You can do it without the tester by removing the plug and grounding it to the block and holding it safely by the boot and have an assistant turn it over. You will see ideally little blue lightning. If it has spark then the safety loop is closed and she should run if its getting fuel. Don't forget clutches can have safety cut offs too.

MechanicAdvice,3czcrx,drsteppa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:56:46 2015 UTC,versions with independent front suspension can be easily lowered by changing the springs or by changing the coil spring to air bag suspension.  you have an I beam heavy duty suspension.  and if you lower the front the back end will be way up in the air.   you may find somebody to help you that does suspension..  or find a P30 chassis that uses the independant suspension and change the entire frame..  nothing is impossible. it only costs more.  it will be easier to put up something around the base when its parked to hide the fact its up in the air..   a former boss bought one of those to carry his off road racer.. he wondered around the lot till he found the only one with a roll up back door..  so it was wide enough to get the race car in and out.  when the dealer delivered it.. it had a narrow pair of swinging doors.. that was not wide enough to get the chassis in without the suspension.  i don't know if the dealer swapped it or if the boss selected the wrong van from the front.  he was very upset.     edit.. there is a way.. that with some creativity.. and if you only want the truck lowered when parked. that hydraulic cylinders be installed that pull the suspension down to the stops..  when its being driven the valves are opened to allow the fluid to come and go directly into the reservoir..

MechanicAdvice,3cyvr7,itssjones19,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:57:05 2015 UTC,I had heard before that in the Cadillac engine they didnt add the oil holes to the pistons. In all other engines when the oil coats the piston the hole in the piston head helps it sink back down. Apparently in Cadillac they took away the piston holes. Meaning more oil stays on the piston and that results in the oil burning off and you loosing oil. It seems common for Cadillac owners to add a quart every 1k miles or so. Also ive heard way too many horror stories about Cadillacs to ever buy one myself. Which is disappointing because i love the luxury and think they look gorgeous.
MechanicAdvice,3cxobe,deeyaygoe,5,Sat Jul 11 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"Depends.  What you are looking for in a healthy engine is less variation between cylinders.  A complete compression test includes a static test, an idle running test, and a snap throttle test.   A typical static test might show 150 psi. A typical running test at idle 70  psi, and a snap throttle should show 80% of the static (except old Chevy V8's usually show 100% of static).

MechanicAdvice,3cxta7,gainsaw,2,Sat Jul 11 19:11:40 2015 UTC,positive it's backfiring and not just exhaust popping? backfire will be more of a gunshot type of noise with possible flames out the tail pipe. exhaust popping is just a low rumbling kind of pop. If it's really backfiring then that points more toward and ignition problem. Backfire is when you get too much fuel and it then ignites all at one in the exhaust. So either your getting wayyyy too much fuel (did the shop adjust your air mixture screws?) or your not getting spark on all your plugs. Did you check that each one is giving off a good spark?
MechanicAdvice,3cxta7,dvorak13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:03:33 2015 UTC,No there was definately light coming from the exhaust when I was trying to get it going last night. noticed popping when I let off the throttle and pull the clutch but this is different. It also happens when I go over 7k rpms
MechanicAdvice,3cxta7,Downtownpiglet,2,Sun Jul 12 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"What I do is take off the air filter and have a can of carb clean spray, then when you're trying to start the bike, spray the chem tool up the intake. If it then starts you know it's lack of fuel related.  If it still won't run good I get my timing light, put the pick up lead on first one coil wire, then the others and see if the timing light flashes right when you try to run it it. Cutting out flash means it's the ignition.  If it flashes and you sprayed fuel into it but the bike still won't run right it's time to check the compression."
MechanicAdvice,3cyije,Rolo_Swag,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:57:11 2015 UTC,is your truck equipped with 4 wheel anti lock brakes?? i don't recall what year they first started installing antilocks on those.   did you have any problem bleeding it.. could you have a defective hose.. that is not releasing pressure when the pedal is released..  with that wheel up in the air.. a friend pump the pedal and release.. does the caliper release when you open the bleeder screw?? if YES it does release the brake.. tighten it..  have the friend pump the pedal again.. and release.. is the caliper still locked.?? if so loosen the brake line fitting into the top of the hose to the caliper.. does this release the caliper.. if NO it does NOT release the caliper.. then replace the brake hose..  read brake hose tips at bottom..   there is a combo valve on all others.. that is the valve pin inside is pushed all the way one way.   there is  pin under the rubber boot on the end that you will need to depress while somebody steps on the brake pedal in an attempt to recenter it.  you may need to bleed the rear brake... the brake warning light will usually be ON with the key in the RUN position .. sometimes it is not seen as the parking brake shares the same circuit..   Tips on changing the brake caliper hoses...  with the hose you are GOING TO REPLACE put a pair of vice grip pliers on the middle of the hose to avoid fluid loss..   remove ONLY at the caliper..  install the new hose to the caliper..   now.. you can remove the tube nut into the chassis end of the hose and drop the old hose with the pliers on it out and slip the new hose in place.. start the threads of the tube nut before you put the clip in..  this is the big part of the tip.. you will loose almost no fluid doing it this way..   once the hose is installed.. i top up the master. put the lid back on tight.. open the caliper bleeder screw..  and bounce my palm on the brake pedal really fast but not far.. this allows me to build pressure in the master and out the open bleeder screw but because i have not pushed the internal seals past the fill port.. i don't create vacuum that pulls air in at the caliper.    so a little more info from you..   and if the combo valve is in the locked or safety lock out position.. you will have a ROCK HARD PEDAL that does NOT MOVE..

MechanicAdvice,3cy2cs,barto5,2,Sat Jul 11 20:31:44 2015 UTC,You should check to see if the a/c compressor is engaged when the air is warm. I had a mdx come in the shop which had an intermittent issue with the a/c compressor clutch relay and the symptoms were close to what you're describing. You could try swapping a relay from another components slot (I believe the horn is the same) and see if it solves your issue. Good luck!
MechanicAdvice,3cy2cs,See_Rocks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the first step in any A/C diagnosis should be an evac and recharge.  Knowing that proper amount of refrigerant is in the system is crucial.    Air conditioning works on the principle of latent heat of evaporation and condensation.  When a substance (in this case refrigerant) evaporates and changes state from a liquid to a gas, it absorbs heat.  When it condenses from a gas back to a liquid, it releases heat.    In an automotive air conditioning system, the compressor is used to compress refrigerant in a gaseous state.  The gas, which is now at a high temperature and a high pressure, then travels to the condenser (mounted in front of the radiator) where it is cooled by airflow and condenses into liquid, thus releasing a large amount of heat. From there, it travels through a restriction - some manufactures use an expansion valve and some use an orifice tube.  The principle is the same though, as the restriction lowers the pressure of the liquid.  As pressure decreases, temperature decreases as well (think about the way an aerosol can gets cold when you spray it). Now the cold refrigerant, still in a liquid state, moves to the evaporator, which is located inside the cabin of the vehicle near the heater core.  Air from the vehicle passes over the evaporator and heats up the refrigerant (and cools the air).  As heat is transferred from the air to the refrigerant, the refrigerant evaporates back into a gas. From there the low pressure gas returns to the compressor to be compressed where the cycle starts over again.    So how does all this relate to your A/C problem?  Well, without looking at the actual vehicle I can only speculate, but what I can tell you is that the compressor is controlled by pressure.  Basically, the compressor will raise the pressure on the high side of the system creating the potential for a large pressure difference (and temperature drop) at the orifice tube or expansion valve.  Once the pressure reaches a specified point, the compressor will shut off.    If your system is over charged - or if it is contaminated with air you might experience the situation you are describing.  For example, air could be compressed to pressures similar to those of refrigerant, but it would not change states (liquid to gas) the same way that refrigerant would.  So, while the pressure might be enough to turn the compressor on, it would not cool properly.    My best advice would be to start with a evac and recharge.  Once you know that the system is full of the proper amount of refrigerant, you can then assess the performance and diagnose the system further to determine of any other problems exist."

It looks like you do have enough room, but if you don't, you can use a crow's foot attachment for the nut.  They come in different sizes, same as a wrench.  They work in tight spots or when you can't get a whole wrench on the nut.  And technically, you're supposed to measure the torque from the nut end.  Mostly, it has to do with static friction and such.  The technical term is escaping me at the moment.

MechanicAdvice,3cxyl4,MilwaukeeMechanic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that this sounds like an accessory pulley or belt making noise.  Timing belt is also quite likely as a different poster noted a TSB relating to a squeak from the tensioner.    Sometimes spraying a small amount of water on the drive belt while the engine is running will be enough to diagnose the problem.  You are not looking to eliminate the sound, but rather listening to see if it changes at all when the belt gets wet.  It it does change, you can be sure that the problem is limited to the accessory belt and/or pulleys.    Another poster suggested cat litter.  I've never tried this method, but it's the same principle so I don't see why it wouldn't work."

The car can check for misfire, but normally it isn't capable of pinpointing it farther than that. If you've replaced the spark plugs and wires, you could check your distributor (cap and rotor?) to see if it's a timing issue.  Other than that, it could be a fuel issue as you said, in which case check the fuel filter first. If those things gum up, they'll bottleneck your fuel feed."

MechanicAdvice,3cxsbo,Pops__Racer,2,Sun Jul 12 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"Probably an evap code. The gas tank venting system is a complicated mess of hoses and electric controls and something in the system is losing pressure.

I avoid the cheap one as they never seem to last me.  Mid price level does fine.  Your gas is still ok.  When you get it started up take it and fill the tank to dilute the older fuel.

MechanicAdvice,3cwjhx,Valalvax,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"If you look on the battery it should have a size listed somewhere something like (78D). If it does, jsut go to the parts store and buy another. If not, you can just go to the store and they can easily look it up for you.  The fuel isn't a huge concern, less than a year isn't that horrible all things considered. As others have said, go get a jerry can and top up the tank with some good quality new gas to mix in with the old. Cars can tolerate some water in the fuel, and the bigger concern is the possibility for the inside of the tank to have began to rust. No way to know this though until you start driving it and check the fuel filter.  The tire will most likely have to be replaced, but you might be able to air it up in order to drive it to the shop. If not, and if you don't have a spare, a can of fix-a-flat might get the job done, but this is just a temporary fix until you can get a new tire.  There are certainly roadside services that can take care of putting on a spare tire and replacing a battery for you, but you'll pay a good bit more than if you just did it yourself. I've never heard of a company coming and pumping your tank for you, but if you don't have an anti siphon its not a hard job to do."

You'll have to isolate where the noise is coming using a cheap mechanic stethoscope (I wouldn't recommend using a long screwdriver but in a bind you could) to better accurately diagnose where the sound is coming from.  If its the lifters you could try changing oil and see if the noise goes away.   You may have to try different oil weight before you find the right one.  If it's one of the pulley then determine whether it needs to be re-torqued or if there are damages to bolts that requires replacement of bolts, pulleys and or belts. An indication of bad pulley are excessive wobbling.  You should run compression and leak down tests to determine if the valves are bad.  If it's valves then I wish you luck."

MechanicAdvice,3cut9g,agravain,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:22:28 2015 UTC,"Low side is only half the system. Ac in theory is pretty simple but there is a lot that can affect it. If it had a charge in it before you put the can in it then refrigerant was not the issue. You goofed and it should be properly evacuated and recharged now.   Expansion valves are pretty common, but were the radiator fans turning on? Was the compressor turning on? Honda's are infamous for bad relays.   Most vehicles while running should be somewhere around 30psi low side while ac is operating high side should be over 150psi. When the system is off the pressure could be anything depending on ambient temperature. These pressures vary depending on ambient temperature too."

Based on this, EPA regulations do not prohibit venting, but it is still not the right method of diagnosis and repair.    Basically, you now don't know how much (or what exactly) is in your A/C system.  Your first step should be to take the car to a qualified shop and have the system diagnosed.  The shop will recover whatever refrigerant is currently in the system, pull the system into a vacuum, and then refill the system with liquid refrigerant by weight - which is the only method to get an accurate charge.    The shop will probably also add dye in case there are any leaks to be found.  After properly charging the system, then you can use manifold gauges (which are built into the A/C machine) to diagnose the system.    There are any number of problems that could cause poor a/c performance.... and pressures will tell you almost everything you need to know.

MechanicAdvice,3cu4xy,bassnote1,2,Fri Jul 10 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"The drip pattern could be as simple as the coolant running down to the bottom of the radiator, running along the bottom and dripping where it gathers enough to be subject to gravity."

Honestly radiators tend to leak slowly and then give all at once. Since the radiator is that old I would go ahead and replace everything else in the coolant system too. The reason I say this is if you had one hose go bad the others are likely to follow, and every part in your coolant system is likely at the end of its life. It will be a lot simpler to replace the system now rather than waiting for it to go bad, and potentially take your motor with it. I had a radiator go on my old vehicle, and then 2 weeks later a plastic valve coming from my heater core went out. I was on the highway at the time, and didn't notice until it was too late. By the time I was able to pull it off to the side my motor was shot. It was cheaper for me to throw in a used motor than it was to even try fixing the old one."

MechanicAdvice,3cu4xy,sunflashmace7,2,Sat Jul 11 04:13:22 2015 UTC,I don't see water pumps drizzle. If it is the water pump weep hole releasing coolant it should be a good bit coming out whenever the car is running. A good way to check is crawl underneath and find the weep hole. If it is wet and discolored then you likely have a bad water pump. Having a bad water pump means trips around town shouldn't be possible with out losing quite a bit of coolant imo.

Pop the drums off and smack the shoes side to side and verify that the cylinder pistons move.   Fresh fluid is never a bad idea.

If you use cheap pads & rotors then your stopping power will be horrible. I remember when I bought my 2nd Chevy Celebrity, it had new brakes but they were the shittiest of the shit quality, so I had to change them out for something more expensive to get decent stopping power. Although I think the stopping power in these cars aren't that great to begin with especially compared to a car of todays era.  Anyway you either have JA1 or JA2 brakes...JA2 brakes are heavier duty.

MechanicAdvice,3cuivh,3sheetsdiesel,2,Sat Jul 11 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"Replacing the steel brake and fuel lines is a DIY type of repair, assuming that you have a lot of time and know how to flare steel lines.  You'll need a double flaring tool to make the flares, as well as a selection of fittings.  It is a time-consuming pain in the ass, but flaring brake lines isn't terribly difficult.  It does take practice to do it correctly so that you get a leak free seal.  Here's a video for you to watch about flaring brake lines.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fmF9mm3hsM  Flaring fuel lines is the exact same procedure, you just need a different size flaring adapter.  If memory serves the brake lines on your CR-V are 3/16th and the fuel line is probably 3/8th.  Just make sure that you're willing to do all of it before you get started, as stopping in the middle of the job isn't an option.  Also, if your CR-V has ABS, make sure that you have some way of bleeding the ABS module in case you accidentally run the brake system out of fluid."

Ours does a lot of sales like that. They can run anywhere price wise. Ours changes monthly. So I can't be completely sure on price.  Factory plugs are specific to each cars ignition needs, so generic plugs have a tendency to have too high or too low of a resistance.   For example: I have a 2007 nissan 2.5 frontier. I can't put plugs from the same year altima 2.5 in it and have it run properly. Same engine, different applications. More load on my truck because of weight so different resistance plugs are needed.

MechanicAdvice,3cuhaj,RickMN,2,Fri Jul 10 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Semi metallic pads are designed with steel fibers to carry heat away from the friction surface to the back backing plate. They provide the best stopping power. That's why they're factory on SUVs and truck. BUT, because of the metallic content they make noise, chew up rotors faster, and give off a lot of brake dust.  Ceramic pads are designed to make less noise and create less brake dust. It's a myth that they stop faster. They don't. They're installed on 60% of all new cars because the car makers got tired of hearing brake noise and dust complaints.   Also, keep in mind that there are NO federal standards as to what qualifies as a semi met or ceramic. Materials can vary widely from brand to brand and even from a brand's premium to their economy version."
MechanicAdvice,3cuhaj,RickMN,2,Fri Jul 10 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, this makes a lot more sense, so since I don't really care about the noise should I go with the semi-metallic? It sounds like overall they're the best option other then how quickly they chew rotors, which is fine since they"
MechanicAdvice,3ct1f4,randomlurker82,6,Fri Jul 10 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"I have a 300SD.  The diesels have a very high compression ratio and take a lot of power to turn over, plus the glow plugs draw a lot of power as well. I would start off by replacing your battery - make sure you buy the correct size, group 49 with 850 CCA.  This is much bigger than the ""typical"" car battery enough so that most people will comment on seeing it!  It's not that much more expensive. Difference:   http://www.benzworld.org/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=239856&stc=1&thumb=1&d=1242749428  Once you have installed it (13mm wrench on the terminal clamps, don't forget the hold-down nuts at the front bottom edge of the trray, and careful not to ground the positive terminal on the hood hinge with the wrench!) then start the car.    If it starts quickly and easily like before, the next thing is to test the alternator output with a volt-meter by putting the voltmeter's probes on the battery terminals while the car is idling.  It should be putting out about 13.5 to 13.8 volts.  Low 13's or below mean you may have a failing alternator or voltage regulator (both not too difficult to change yourself - if you can swap the battery with ease then the alternator re/re is one step more difficult.)    If it turns out the charging voltage is low, I can walk you through the alternator/voltage regulator swap or direct you to a step by step how to online."

MechanicAdvice,3ct1f4,theotherjazen,3,Mon Jul 13 20:04:38 2015 UTC,"How old is the battery? Its possible one of the cells in your battery died some time between this morning and when it failed to start. I recently had a very similar issue where one moment the car started just fine, and the next it was dead (I'm still kinda new at driving stick). After recharging the battery it had enough juice to light up all the lights and chimes, but go to crank, the starter did not even click.  Keep in mind a diesel needs alot of power to warm up the glow plugs, so it could be sapping whatever little power the battery has left, leaving nothing when the starter tries to crank."
MechanicAdvice,3ct1f4,labradorasaurus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"I thought battery as well, but as it turned out it was a fuse.

MechanicAdvice,3ct1f4,labradorasaurus,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"Id check for a loose connector first in the ignition circuit, if it is a manual check the clutch safety. I literally just had the same issue (buzzing, fail to start obvious signs of glow plugs working, no crank) and I had a failed clutch safety which I simply ziptied so it always thinks mu clutch is in so it starts (bye bye cruise control!). The click means power is going to your starter solenoid but it wont crank if your safety switch has failed (there is one on an automatic too, but I do not know how to fix that)."

MechanicAdvice,3cst0z,ambulancemechanic,4,Fri Jul 10 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"The rule of thumb in the automotive world is you get to pick two adjectives out of these three choices to describe your vehicle of choice: Good, Fast, and Cheap.   -Good relates to overall quality -Fast relates to the overall performance of the car -Cheap relates to cost of the vehicle initially AND the cost of maintenance over the life of the vehicle.   If its good and fast, its not gonna be cheap. If its good and cheap, its not gonna be fast. If its fast and cheap, its not gonna be good.   If you want something thats ""fast"", nice looking, and with AWD have you considered something like a Subaru WRX? Subaru makes good quality vehicles, and they've been building their cars with AWD since the '80s. Also usually fairly cheap to maintain and upkeep.   Obviously there are exceptions to all this, but for the most part you can apply this to any vehicle available out there on the market."
MechanicAdvice,3cst0z,quarensintellectum,2,Fri Jul 10 15:28:49 2015 UTC,So the WRX is good fast and cheap?
MechanicAdvice,3cst0z,AdamsHarv,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:25:01 2015 UTC,"Used or new?  It will be loads cheaper than an Audi but it would probably be similar in cost to a G37.  A 13 year old Audi is going to be expensive if my experiences with my friends MKIV Jetta are anything to base it on.  WRXs are decently fast, you get a good AWD system, and they are not the most expensive to maintain. Problem is that they are beloved by modders and buying a modded one will be incredibly expensive for you.  Even a bone stock one is not without issues. They love to leak oil and the motors flat layout makes it irritating as hell to work on at times.   I don't own a G37 but my friends with their G35s spent a similar amount on maintenance as I did on my WRX.  Biggest problems I have had (aside from suspension issues stemming from an accident when someone drove me into a curb) is leaking oil and an aging turbocharger.  If you buy a stock WRX that is unmodded it will be fast and cheap (to maintain, they hold their value really well though so expect a large upfront cost). However the overall quality (""good""ness) of the WRXs are pretty shitty.   The early models (GG,GD Chasis code in USDM) have very spartan interiors with lots of creaks and lots of audible road noise. Later models aren't as bad but if you are buying a 2010 WRX you might as well buy a 2015, it will only be like 4k more for a base model..."
MechanicAdvice,3cst0z,sunflashmace7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"The AWD is nice, but honestly I don't like the looks of the A4. I know I'm the outlier on that opinion though so no worries. It all depends on what you want out of the car, and how much you are willing to spend. If you have a decent chunk of money I'd go for a Subaru their AWD is great, and service wise they aren't that bad. I love fast cars, but you get what you pay for with them."

MechanicAdvice,3cst0z,xxrecar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think we're at a loss as to your figure of how much an Audi costs to fix, and for what repairs were made. Also did you go to the stealership for repairs? If so, have you looked into a local garage possibly doing repairs?  If you're really interested in Infinity, have you look towards Nissan? Infinity is the luxury brand of Nissan, so the cars should be similar, with a Nissan being more common, and cheaper.  Just start googling for a vehicle's problem areas. This means lots of new forum accounts. Once you can find the problem areas, you can gauge the costs of repairs. For instance, I am really interested in getting an Evo at some point. So I did some research and found that the transmissions take a shit once you start modifying the car, which is what everyone who wants an Evo or an STI does.  If you're dead set on AWD, take a long hard look at Suburus. As mentioned in the comment, a WRX is a great car. But keep in mind it is a very small car with a cheap interior. If you want something bigger, look at the Legacy/Outback."
MechanicAdvice,3cry40,Leo_Kru,5,Fri Jul 10 07:54:33 2015 UTC,Personally I'd throw a liter of transmission oil (it's high in detergent) with a new change and drive it for a few hundred mines and change the oil again. Then change it sooner than spec a few times. You want clean oil passages but you don't want to fill up your oil filter with gunk and circulate bypassed oil and if some of that gunk is slowing class 1 or 2 leaks from becoming a class 3 (dropping on the ground) then you don't want to remove what's there.  Through the intake I like Seafoam. Some people say it's snake oil but the way I look at it is IF using the product will help the engine that means it needed it. It can't work miracles. If it doesn't help then that just means the engine didn't need what the Seafood offers. Carbon and gummy deposits in the intake can really bring an engines performance down.

MechanicAdvice,3cry40,akthunder73,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:11:22 2015 UTC,"Seafoam in badly sludged engine oil can cause problems. I have personally seen valve guide seals start to heavily leak after a good seafoam job. On an engine that you know is free of sludge and is in good working order, I see no problem with half a can in the engine oil and half a can through a vac hose such as a brake booster for a good carbon clean service. Just carefully regulate the flow into the intake as it is possible to hydrolock."
MechanicAdvice,3cry40,GaiusBaltar_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:50:50 2015 UTC,You say we know sea foam works but all I ever hear in terms of evidence is absolutely anecdotal. The hardest evidence I've ever seen is a guy using some in a lawn over engine and it really didn't do that much. IMO it's snake oil until proven otherwise. I don't want predictable responses from any people here claiming miracle results. I want some actual evidence. I don't expect that to ever be available.

MechanicAdvice,3csp51,uwott,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:38:28 2015 UTC,Ford did put in 6 disc changers in a lot of their cars. They were accessed via the head unit in the dash. I have never seen a 10 disc nor were they Audiologic branded. So most likely someone put in an aftermarket head unit to interface with the disc changer. When they sold the car they took out the new head unit and replaced it with a stock one. But they didn't want to fuss with the disc changer. Probably because it doesn't work. Those things fail after time. Most of the ones I have seen no longer work.  I would invest in a new head unit along with a wiring harness and an adaptor kit if needed to fit the radio in the dash.

MechanicAdvice,3crmn6,whatwhatdb,3,Fri Jul 10 05:32:33 2015 UTC,first step.. print and perform the six steps in this test. http://i.imgur.com/WMDprhm.jpg why.. because i find so many issues i came up with this test..  test 5 and 6 are really important.. i found a 98 C2500 with 8.5 volts on test 4.   please perform if you can reach the bumpers or frame. test 3 and 4 again to them.. why.. the fuel pump is grounded to the frame rail just in front of the left rear tire. the tail lights are also grounded to the frame rail. the frame rail is grounded to the motor at the lower right front on the engine block where the battery negative cable is connected.   next step.. replace the fuel pump relay with a new one..  don't throw out the old one.. remove the cover from the relay carefully.. examine the contacts.. reinstall the bare frame relay and give it a squeeze.. the fuel pump should turn on..   if you have a digital volt meter that has an 10 amp or higher setting.. you can pull the fuel pump fuse and reconnect your test leads into the 10AMP and common ports on the meter and probe into the fuse socket.. squeeze the relay to turn on the pump.. and you should get a nice even reading.. and hear fuel surging thru the fuel lines.  if the amp draw surges.. the pump may be failing.   next step.. get the engine running..  pull the fuel pump relay out..  the engine should continue to run..  if it dies.. replace the 3 wire oil pressure switch.. its the redundant switched power for the fuel pump circuit..   next step.. under the dashboard.. with a friend in the drivers seat.. you with a circuit tester. check the ignition switch right at the connector.. http://i.imgur.com/zDbdXyJ.jpg   do this while your friend slowly rotates the key from OFF.. slowly thru ON cranking.. ON.. then off..  the white wire at C1 and the pink wire at C5 are really important in your failure mode.  gm ignition switches have been known to fail internally from dirty and worn contacts..  and please verify that the fuel pump ground connection got reinstalled and tightened properly .. top of the frame rail.. left side reached thru the left rear wheel well just in front of the tire.   so you ask mechanicsadvice for testing.. you have it.. print this.. its only 20 to 30 minutes to perform this entire test sequence step by step.

The spark plug ignition coil was replaced twice, even though the plugs, wires, and coil had been replaced around 100,000.  The plugs, wires, and electrical had to be replaced again in the 140,000's (they were OEM), the head gaskets had blown twice (once before I had owned it) and ended up failing a third time, and for some reason an axle had started to spew grease.  I'm not sure if it was corrosion, wear and tear, etc.  I couldn't even get $2000 out of it when I sold it.

MechanicAdvice,3core9,GNUtoReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"IMO and my own experience as a tech for the last 17 years, the Japanese manufacturers have better quality vehicles.  In the class you are looking for, Rav-4 and CR-V are excellent choices.  Tacoma is a very good truck as well.  Personally, I drive a Honda Ridgeline and I wouldn't trade it for any of the vehicles you mentioned.  It's midsize, comfortable, versatile and ultra-reliable.  The knocks, IMO would be poor fuel economy for a V6 (~18 in mixed driving) and price.  A fully loaded RTL with navi would run 38K or more.    I have heard good things about the Ford Escapes, but don't have any personal experience with them.   Every manufacturer has it's problems, but in my experience the Honda and Toyota issues are not serious problems (airbag issue aside).  My Ridgeline had some dash bulbs that burned out at like 40k, which is a dumb thing to have happen, and the cargo light flickers when the tailgate is opened.  Pretty minor stuff.  Powertrain, suspension, and steering are rock solid.    My best suggestion is to get out and drive some vehicles.  You can shop online all day, but you won't know what you like until you get behind the wheel."

Japanese brands will be reliable and cheaper on maintenance /repairs over the car's entire lifespan. And of course they follow metric system instead of SAE (easier for DIY work imo). however, if you want ""power"" for carrying or towing heavier loads, maybe American is a better choice?

They are fine mixed together but the shop put the orange stuff In because that's what they do for all gm vehicles.

MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,threefoxes,6,Thu Jul 9 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"Audi mechanic here. First off, I just quoted a timing belt on an 06 2.0T today. It was about 1200 bucks, with the water pump, tensioner, rollers, coolant, everything. So screw those dealer prices.  As for the engine mounts. In the labor guide it tells you that to remove the passenger engine mount you need to remove the turbocharger/exhaust manifold. It is BS, I have done it many times without. Book says labor for the passenger side is 6+ hours and 1.3(ish) for the other side. I usually charge 3 for both. I make decent money on the job and it is way cheaper for the customer. Both engine mounts should be able to be done under $800 bucks.  Tires, well they are tires.  Timing belt is critical. Though it is due on your car at 105k miles or 10 years. So unless they have seen something particular. It could wait, a bit."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,HowdyAudi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"Spot on.  Source: I did all this work to my b7 last year.  Never skimp on tires, but no need to goto a dealership for those. My nittos were $600 installed with warranty."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,endmass,-1,Fri Jul 10 06:12:30 2015 UTC,Gotta say I've never even changed a bulb in an Audi. I work on light to heavy duty trucks and heavy equipment. How the hell does a motor mount leak? Sounds like a piss poor design.
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,aforkin,5,Thu Jul 9 23:52:42 2015 UTC,Luxury cars come with luxury amenities. If you have the kind of $ to buy one of these cars you want something that is smooth as silk. A hydraulic mount is far smoother than typical rubber or hardass polyurethane.
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,Adv4nceautosucks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"Snarkiness aside... Not so much a poor design but a design for a different end goal. Where on a truck you want strength and durability. On a luxury vehicle, comfort and performance is paramount. So they are a liquid filled mount that will give a smoother feel at idle but firm up under torque.   Some even use vacuum to control the stiffness and some use an electrical current and a mag fluid."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,HowdyAudi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"thank you, makes sense now. I guess i replied too quick and never gave that a thought. My first thought was that it was somehow gasketed to the engine block and produced a leak there."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,aforkin,3,Fri Jul 10 16:10:56 2015 UTC,Not an Audi expert here but the pricing seems high looking at book time.  Timing belt job looks like under 6 hours labor + parts.  Dealer should be $1k or $750ish at an independent.  It is imperative that you have this service done on time but they are trying to do it early.    Tires you can get anywhere.  Check the tire size and go shopping.   Motor mounts I wouldn't personally worry about until you start to notice vibration but that's just my cheapness showing.  Word of advice.  If you plan to keep this car find a mechanic that specializes in VW/Audi (not just a foreign car mechanic) and start building a relationship with them.  These cars get hellishly expensive to service as they age and you can't afford to take it to the dealer for everything unless you've got some extra buckets of money sitting around.  Check your tires for wear before going on your trip.  Look across the entire width of the front tires and check for low tread and cracking.  That's all I would worry about before your trip.
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,imprl59,2,Thu Jul 9 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"Can't speak to the timing belt and engine mounts, but check out tirerack.com, discounttiredirect.com, and treaddepot.com for tires.  Even if an independent shop charges you $50 each to mount and balance them, you'll still only be paying around $800 total."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,ephantmon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:12:59 2015 UTC,"Audi is notoriously expensive to repair (Any European import really). Timing belts are critical engine components. Because of the fact that they destroy an engine when they break, they are a maintenance item that is changed every 60k-100k (Vehicle dependent). The engine mounts are a good idea if they are leaking. And you can check the tires yourself. Google what to look for on tires.  If you can find an independent shop, then the cost of the repairs will be much much much cheaper. Probably $3000 all together, (Wild guess)."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,Gift_of_Intelligence,0,Thu Jul 9 21:26:51 2015 UTC,so really the only super critical component is the timing belt? Would it be a really bad idea to take a road trip to north carolina (about 4hr drive each way) this weekend?
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,reboticon,2,Thu Jul 9 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"Tires are usually more critical. One could cost you your car, the other your life. Engine mounts are the least important. In all honesty it seems early for Timing belt. Alldata shows the interval at 110,000 miles or 10 years, and you are under both."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,Gift_of_Intelligence,2,Thu Jul 9 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"The engine mounts can cause vibration, but probably won't cause much damage in the short term.  The condition of the tires depend on exactly how bad they are. I've seen tires with severe cracking last a couple years, and some people drive them until the bands are showing. When the bands are showing, you definitely don't want to drive them long distances, at all if you can help it. If they're just bald, you should be fine on dry pavement.  The timing belt could be fine, or it could be ready to snap at any moment. There's no good way to tell, although there is usually an inspection port. If you plan to change it in the next 5,000 miles, it will probably be fine."
MechanicAdvice,3cq16r,endmass,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"There's an inspection port right on the front of the motor. Takes 2 seconds to check.  My OEM belt was changed at 114k, didn't look too bad."

Motor mounts are not a maintenance item and should be repaired at your earliest convenience.

These laws are most often enforced at the local level. So, OP likely has no emissions testing in his area. That doesn't mean the shop would not be breaking the law if it gutted or eliminated the cat.  In the US, it is illegal to tamper with an emission control device. The cat is an emission control device. The fine is $10k per occurrence. LEGIT shops don't remove/gut cats for fear of being fined."

If someone cuts it off themself, they are the ones liable, and it's not like the EPA is going door to door.  I wouldn't worry about it, though. Your converter has lost efficiency, it isn't clogged.

Person A yells: ""Pump it up!""  Person B pumps brake pedal several times until it gets firm and then holds pressure and yells ""Holding!"" Person A opens one of the bleeder screws and allows fluid to flow out along with air. Person B yells ""down!"" when the pedal reaches the floor, but continues holding pressure. Person A tightens (closes) bleeder screw.   Repeat procedure multiple times as needed, going from one wheel to the next until all air is out of the system.

When you start a car, or just turn the key to RUN, the position before START, all the lights move come on. This is called 'Bulb Check' or 'Prove Out.' By law the airbag light on the cluster must 'Prove Out' every ignition cycle.   Meaning it runs through a series of internal tests and either turns out the light, or illuminates the light and disables part or all of the air bag system. It's unfortunately not that uncommon for a vehicle from auction to have certain 'troublesome' bulbs removed to make it look like it has zero problems. Given what you have said about the front bumper color and spacing, the vehicle has probably been hit in the front. If the airbag light on the cluster never 'proves out' someone has removed it to mask underlying problems."

MechanicAdvice,3cpkub,lefty88,2,Fri Jul 10 02:32:46 2015 UTC,Having spent a lot of my life around dealerships.....    When a dealership sends a car to auction it always bothers me.  That dealership is in the business of selling cars for profit so why did they decide to send this one to auction and get the least possible amount of profit?   Perhaps they have more cars than they can deal with.  Perhaps they know the car is a turd sammich and they don't want to risk their reputation with it.    I personally don't buy auction cars.  I prefer to buy from the previous owner directly as you can tell how the car was taken care of when you see them and their home 99 times out of 100.  New car dealer trade in is next best to me as they send the bad ones to auction.   If you do decide to go through with it I would have it inspected by an independent mechanic before doing so and bring up your concerns with them.

The radiator cap is pressurized and it opens when the system reaches 13-16 psi, coolant is then pushed into the overflow. If your overflow is steaming either your radiator cap is not holding pressure, or you have excessive pressure building in your system.  Only one of the two scenarios is cheap, and that is buying a new radiator cap. The other scenario involves pulling your cylinder head and generally costs over a thousand dollars.

MechanicAdvice,3co1gj,RickMN,4,Thu Jul 9 12:26:28 2015 UTC,"Well ""dexcool"" is ethylene glycol.   The GEL issue was when air and newer long life coolant's inter mix. Older cars did not have a pressurized overflow tank, just open. So when coolant got low air was easy to get into the engine and create the orange gel. Don't let your coolant get low and you will be fine.   The mixing issue was if you mix longlife with standard then you lose the long life properties. This is still true, you can mix but then you have to fall back to the lowest change interval.   Most coolants today are dexcool based; even the longlife all-car prestone, longlife store brand, etc...   So no need to do a major flush just hose it out and fill with a 50/50 mix of the cheapest longlife coolant. Name brand does not matter."

So no matter what coolant you used it was going to go bad. As long as you get a aftermarket intake and gasket set that will fix it, last I checked."

Also if the engine has low compression from a bent rod then it is only a matter of time before it fails catastrophically if you continue to run it.

Edit: your mechanic sounds like shit. Was the new engine a crate motor? If so all your old parts ie: starter, manifolds, alternator, etc would have come off the old block and reapplied to the new one, meaning he should have definitely noticed a cracked manifold. Secondly, why the fuck did he grind the starter? If it was the old one and it didn't fit theirs your first problem, if it were new and it still didn't fit, it apparently wasn't the correct starter."

One of the rockers over cyl 2 isn't centered on the spring but the rocker over the cylinder with low compression looks OK. I'll post a pic later today. I think I'll be hard pressed to get the motor covered under warranty in this condition. The starter was actually an OEM replacement that we had put on the old motor 2 years ago. We got it from stingray. I got it to fit in the old motor just fine. He said that he had to take a little bit of the tip off so it wouldn't hit the flywheel. The starter seems to run fine with all of the plugs out so I'm not super worried about it. My mechanic did say to get a better one from merc and it would fit better."

MechanicAdvice,3cpesb,NotGreatButITry,2,Thu Jul 9 18:35:02 2015 UTC,Invest in 1990 ford ranger fuel filter and 3 feet of 3/8 or 5/16 fuel hose . Install that directly before your fuel pump. Get you engine started and squeeze the hose between the fuel filter and the pump inlet with a pair of needle nose pliers. While squeezing bring up the rpms.to around 2000. When the engine starts to stumble release the pliers. Repeat 3 or 4 times. This will flush the sediment out of the fuel pump check valves and may restore normal pumping. I have been doing this trick since 1986. Tthe ranger filter is a finer mesh than most others and available everywhere for 10 bucks. I have a tip I will post later about chevy fuel pump changing the easy way.using the oil dipstick.

MechanicAdvice,3cped5,roodylooly,2,Thu Jul 9 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"This is either a transmission range sensor or the shifter itself, I'm not sure how Kia wires it on the sportage. Usually it is a range sensor but Kia has had issues with shifters and shifter locs. This suggests that the problem with #1 is the range sensor. More range sensor.   (I don't know why the 3 doesn't line up, with the 1 and 2, damn reddit formatting. *edit: fixed, thanks)  MASS air and MAF are the same thing, and it won't be the cause of this. It is a transmission error, most likely due to the range sensor. I say most likely because on newer stuff (like 2012), network communication errors can make sensors appear faulty.

MechanicAdvice,3cnet9,favouritoburrito,3,Thu Jul 9 06:51:02 2015 UTC,"The timing chain issue was mostly people letting the car get to low on oil. The ""fix"" for it was GM adjusted the OLM to tell people to change more. I had a 05 first gen with the 3.6 and now a 2nd Gen 09 and just check the oil every month or 1000miles. So change your oil and check it and you should be fine. But make sure the previous owner did the proper maintainece and checked.   The AWD does have a problem with a shaft in the driveline. I am not sure what years it affected but look for the TSB for the AWD models.   Other than that most other complaints are either minor or standard car stuff.   I had a e-class Mercedes between my 1st gen and 2nd, wife could only keep the car 1 year it had so much work done. The CTS's have both had much less upkeep and repairs."

The vehicle has plenty of good miles left in it so I would fix it regardless.  If you find a mechanic with a video scope they can pull the plugs and put the scope in to check and see if you have valve / piston damage before they tear in to it.

The fact that Dorman (crap aftermarket company) makes a better part than the car company is a testament to how crappy Chrysler is now a days.  Although I've never had a shifter misalignment issue afterwards. So I have to assume that something may be broken OR not connected properly.   When you adjust it, most vehicles have to be in neutral. Not all but most. Put it in neutral on your dash then adjust the cable till it shows neutral on the shifter then tighten the screw and see how it goes."

MechanicAdvice,3cl60j,GaiusBaltar_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:05:38 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of Chrysler either but it's not exactly hard for Doorman to improve upon something after the fact if it has a known weak point. Doesn't really say too much about Chrysler IMO. They are annoying to work with though.

MechanicAdvice,3cli39,waynep712222,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:34:29 2015 UTC,"The tag has the following on it: 7026082 A G6 48  I changed the fuel pump out about 15 miles before I just rebuilt the carb because it was leaking gas out of the side. There was definitely trash in the bowl, and this being a '67 I wouldn't doubt there is sediment in the fuel tank. That would make sense that it idles and revs fine in the driveway on level terrain, but then starts to have issues when driving. Makes me think the change in slope going down my driveway and down the street is causing the sediments to move around.  Another note on the fuel pump I just replaced, it has an in/out like the old one, but has a third out which I can only assume is for vapor. The old pump didn't have this third output, so I just capped it with a rubber plug and hose clamp. Instead the fuels system returns vapor to the fuel tank via the fuel filter. The fuel filter I am using has three ports on it. I'm wondering if this is hurting fuel flow somehow too... this stalling/sputtering issue was happening before I rebuilt the carb, just not as bad. It really started not long after I replaced this fuel filter with a new one.

However, if you still cannot fix your issue be advised that a failing ignition coil or high secondary resistance can cause a sensation that feels exactly the same. You can have a great big blue spark at the plug and still have a bad coil, it takes a minimum of 1 millisecond burn time to transfer enough heat from the spark to the gasses to adequately start the combustion process. And unfortunately you can't measure burn time without an ignition scope. Food for thought. Good Luck!"

MechanicAdvice,3clr4i,Hunk_of_Cheese,4,Wed Jul 8 22:05:56 2015 UTC,I would use the same size tire on both sides of the trailer.  They already have enough issues with sway and wonky handling in emergency situations.    4.80-12 are typically load range C which is barely adequate for your stated weight and those things are always heavier than you think they are.  Personally I would fix the issue with the bracket.
MechanicAdvice,3clr4i,imprl59,3,Wed Jul 8 23:04:51 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess that the clearance issue is due to sagged out trailer springs.  I bet if you replaced both leaf springs on the trailer you'd have the proper clearance.  Leaf springs do sag & wear out over time.
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,crhistian26,6,Wed Jul 8 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"Calipers go bad when they leak fluid, when the interior O-ring loses its pliability and doesn't retract the piston (causing pads to drag against rotor), or the caliper pin bores are corroded to the point where they must be replaced.   Leaking and corrosion can be found with visual inspection.   Not retracting can be detected by examining the old pads for signs of uneven wear, or during a test drive after the new pads are installed.  Whatever the shop missed the first time, they should cover some or all of the labor for free this time. But they don't owe you new calipers for free.   Dealers usually install factory new parts. Ask them if they'll install rebuilt calipers instead. Rebuilts are every bit as good as new and cost a lot less.   If they won't do that, find another shop."

MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,baldylox,3,Wed Jul 8 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"If he is at fault, he would be required to replace the pads and rotors he replaced 2 weeks ago, but he would have no reason to give you the calipers for free.

MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,imprl59,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:14 2015 UTC,His contention is that the caliper seized after I left and was not related to the installation. I don't see any way of proving it and he's not willing to cover the cost so I'm kind of SoL on this one
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,iowamechanic30,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"True, but it's also entirely likely that the mechanic damaged the calipers when pushing the caliper pistons back in to fit the new pads.   Of course, that's impossible to really prove.   Shame OP can't DIY. Those calipers are about $50 each for remanufactured ones online. At Auto Zone or other parts stores they're about $75 each - with a hefty core charge."
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,imprl59,4,Wed Jul 8 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"At its most basic form the brake caliper is just a big clamp.  As you step on the brake it squeezes the pads against the rotor.  The actual caliper itself does not rub against anything so their diagnosis makes no sense.    They had those calipers in their hand when they did the brakes two weeks ago.  I don't see how they could both be broken today and were both fine two weeks ago.  Their pricing also is a bit extreme.  You would be looking at two hours labor and $150 in parts at the very most.    I think you've found a ""bad egg"".  Before spending any more money with them get a second opinion from another shop.  I usually recommend a good independent mechanic but they can sometimes be hard to locate.  Any decent chain shop can also do brake work,  Goodyear, firestone, midas.  No body with pep in their company name though..."

I might have misheard or just plain misunderstood.  Pricing is from a dealership which from what I've heard is on the higher end. My dad always used them and trusted them so I just kind of went with it. I think I'm going to try and learn how to do it myself. I'm mechanically minded in other regards (computers) and can follow instruction just never had anyone that knew anything about cars growing up and it sounded awfully expensive if I messed anything up.
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,imprl59,3,Wed Jul 8 16:09:04 2015 UTC,Brake work is not difficult but it is critical that it is done right. If you have someone who knows what they are doing to walk you though it and you have the tools go ahead and try it yourself. If you don't and have no clue what your doing I'd say your better off just paying someone.
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,imprl59,3,Wed Jul 8 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"Dealerships are great for cars under warranty and for difficult to fix problems.  If your car needs a new caliper at the dealership it gets a brand new factory part that lists for $179.   Every other shop in the world is going to use a reman that might cost you half that amount.  Dealer labor is always going to be the highest price as well.  It has to be, they are always located on prime real estate so the taxes are through the roof, someone has to pay for the massive shiny shop and the people that keep it clean and someone has to pay for all the training the techs get.    When you have ""dad money"" the dealer can be great.  Easy in, easy out, someone takes him to work and picks him up after the repair but when you have ""broke college student money"" you can literally get the same job done for half the money or less somewhere else.

MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,crankshaft123,-4,Wed Jul 8 18:29:12 2015 UTC,Is this on the same axle they just serviced?  If so any parts you just replaced should be covered by them.  Part of a brake service is making sure the calipers aren't seized and are working properly.

MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,Good_Behavior_Day,-3,Wed Jul 8 19:59:17 2015 UTC,That isn't right.  He literally had to remove and clean and grease the pins the caliper slides on.  There is no possible way they were fine two weeks ago and not now.  Get the service manager involved.  Start raising hell.  Did you pay with a credit card?

It is entirely possible that the caliper pistons seized 2 weeks after the brake job was done. It's also entirely possible that one or both brake hoses failed internally.   Neither of these scenarios are likely, but weird shit does happen in this industry."
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,rcrracer,2,Thu Jul 9 02:32:29 2015 UTC,I have had the caliper's piston fail after doing a brake job. It's not that uncommon. It usually causes the caliper to stay clamped and the  pads drag on the rotor. Usually it causes that wheel to get hot and you usually get some smoke coming from that wheel and some stink that smells like brake pads. However if it is the caliper slides that are stuck the mechanic should have notified you while it was apart because that is pretty easy to tell. Can you tell exactly what is grinding on what?
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,Azaron83,2,Wed Jul 8 23:38:11 2015 UTC,"Crud can build up behind the piston in the caliper, and when they get pushed back it gets it around the piston and siezes.  It's likely your caliper was on the way out, so if the mechanic did choose to replace it, you would have had to pay for it originally.  If the grinding is rhythmic, it suggests a warped rotor, which suggests everything got cooked when the calipers siezed.  If you were my customer I'd warranty the pads and rotors and ask you to pay for the calipers.  If he doesn't want to give you a break (no pun intended), there's no reason to stay with him as your mechanic."
MechanicAdvice,3ck2kp,halotechnology,3,Thu Jul 9 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"Really you should have taken it back the minute you heard grinding. If you want to replace them yourself, it is doable, but you will need a brake bleed kit and at least one person to help you. You can look at Oreilly auto, Autozone/etc websites to price out your parts and watch youtube vids for tutorials."
MechanicAdvice,3cmxe2,alorinna,5,Thu Jul 9 03:48:18 2015 UTC,"In neutral or in gear your spinning a bearing when you have the clutch in, so you can't say there is no wear going on but if everything else is good your just free spinning a bearing that should last much longer than the clutch disc. If you have a loss of hydraulic pressure you can be wearing out the clutch disc and not know it (same as holding it halfway to the floor) so keeping it in gear while waiting on a red light is not a good habit. If your stuck in traffic and doing a lot of starting and stopping it can't be helped, so get it checked if the clutch seems to engage too quickly (right off the floor)."

On the serious side, you're not putting any wear on the internals of the transmission whether it is in gear or in neutral while the clutch pedal is depressed.    You are however spinning the throwout bearing and the pilot bearing in the flywheel both of which have a limited life.  You're also putting a lateral load on the thrust bearing(s) in the engine.  I've always been horrible about keeping the pedal depressed while sitting at lights and I've never had either fail on me but it does happen.

MechanicAdvice,3cl3zc,Goingdef,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"The turbo can get hot enough under a load to cook away standing oil. As long as the engine is running, oil is pumping. Returning the vehicle to idle for five minutes allows the turbo to slow down, the exhaust gases going thru it are cooler at idle, and the housing is allowed to cool down as well, all with oil flowing thru it. If you shut it down right away, it will cook the oil into carbon and partially block your oil passages. The process repeats until you starve the turbo of any lubrication and it cooks its self."

MechanicAdvice,3ck76s,1broknrado,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"Hi All,  I purchased my 07 1500 4x4 sport hemi about 2 weeks ago. Silly me bought it from a used dealer with no 30 day warranty or anything and didn't drive on the highway during the test run. At 60-70mph I am getting a vibration that I can feel sometimes in the wheel, sometimes in the seat, sometimes in the pedal, sometimes in all 3. Now it's strange that it does this intermittently as it will shake and then other times it wont shake. I've had an alignment done and rebalanced all the tires and did a rotation. This didn't solve the issue.The only problem the tech could find with my truck was a BARELY leaking front driver side axle... he said he wouldn't even replace it yet. The other is a leaky front driver side shock, which I plan to replace shortly.  I've done some more research and saw SOOO many complaints about this in the 06-08 trucks. Anywhere from ball joints, tie rods, torque converter, mds, unbalanced drive shaft, u joints...the list goes on. I really can't afford to just THROW money at it right now...I've also heard that if I do a high speed tire balance, that might help... but I haven't gotten any luck finding a shop that will perform this procedure (Charlotte, NC).  Please help! Having buyers remorse after only 2 weeks :(. I love this truck and the way it drives <55mph but the speed limit here in Charlotte is 70mph!"
MechanicAdvice,3ck76s,waynep712222,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:33 2015 UTC,yes... the high speed balance might help.    you may want to have a look at the brake rotors and drums.. that truck might have gotten some aftermarket versions installed that were NOT balanced from their manufacturer..  hint.. brake drums and removable rotors can be spun up on a wheel balancer to check their state of balance .. with the settings adjusted properly..  it should always read zero when checked.   just a few things.  start the engine.. set the parking brake..  roll down the drivers window.  get out and stand beside the driver door.. open the hood also..   reach thru the open window and rock the steering wheel a few inches back and forth with the wheels straight..  make sure that the fenders are not moving right or left over the top of the tire.. that is just one check.. you have rack and pinion steering.. i just want to make sure that you don't have a bigger issue.   with a friend rocking the steering wheel you should look under the hood at the steering shaft coming out of the steering column tube. other mopar trucks have had an issue there.   you can lay down under the front if its high enough to observe the rack and pinion steering .. make sure its not rocking.. make sure the tie rod ends are not loose where one moves before the spindle does.  at 70  its probably brake drums/rotors out of balance or wheel balance.. could even be the drive shaft..   its less likely to be suspension. . if your shocks are worn.. you could also have a wheel tramp issue where the smallest imbalance causes issues..

I will have to try to find harder for aplace to do a high speed balance, if that doesn't fix it, then I'll check the driveshaft balance, then the rotors/pads.   Thank you for your response!"

MechanicAdvice,3ck76s,waynep712222,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:36:32 2015 UTC,I did miss that the rotors should be balanced. I've never heard of that before but I will start looking into rotors/pads for the front as they are worn and need to be replaced.
MechanicAdvice,3ck76s,waynep712222,2,Thu Jul 9 12:58:22 2015 UTC,rotors and drums are balanced at the factory that made them before they are boxed for shipping.. if one slipped thru without being balanced at the factory it could cause a high speed vibration that would not go away.. because nobody but a few people and me have ever mounted a rotor or brake drum on a wheel balancer to see if it is OUT OF BALANCE..  there is no way to fix it if it is out of balance..  it should come back to 0.00  if you set them on a wheel balancer..  you might have gotten that truck because the former owner could not get it to stop vibrating at highway speed.. its ONLY an idea..  but my ex father in law had a ford van with drum brakes.. when i pulled the front wheel off.. the drum rotated on its own .. the balance weight had fallen off the drum..

MechanicAdvice,3cmf52,kanzanr,2,Thu Jul 9 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"If the engine idles smooth with your foot on the throttle, it's probably an IAC issue. Probably has nothing to do with overheating, it's likely the PCV vale/hose is clogged or the wires got pulled out of the IAC valve connector. Make sure the PCV is clear because that's a metered air leak around the throttle then remove and clean the IAC valve. I don't know if part stores have a tester for loan, it's pretty hard to test without one."
MechanicAdvice,3cmf52,Pops__Racer,2,Thu Jul 9 02:53:17 2015 UTC,"The PCV system on OP's car is not a metered air leak around the throttle, and it doesn't have a hose.  The valve lives under a little cover on the passenger side of the intake manifold.  The top of the valve is exposed to manifold vacuum and the bottom of the valve is exposed to crank case vapor.  I agree that IAC is most likely OP's problem.  It can be tested w/ a bi-directional scan tool or an old-school IAC tester. I don't think any autoparts stores loan those tools, but I don't borrow tools from autoparts stores, so I'm not really sure about that."
MechanicAdvice,3cmf52,crankshaft123,2,Thu Jul 9 03:29:14 2015 UTC,"No hose for the PCV? Fine, it's directly in the intake. It's taking intake manifold vacuum and exposing it to the crankcase.

If the engine isn't smoking, overheating, bubbling exhaust in the coolant or mixing the oil and coolant, I wouldn't lean that way."
MechanicAdvice,3cm28z,Arkamis,2,Wed Jul 8 23:33:14 2015 UTC,It isn't likely that a bad computer messed up the coil.  Their bad coil might have messed up the computer or more likely they broke something while testing.  No easy answer except to tow it somewhere else that is able to fix it.

MechanicAdvice,3cm28z,Pops__Racer,2,Thu Jul 9 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the shop is in over their heads. A primary ignition failure on the 6 cyl engine is going to be all guess work unless they have the tools and skills to get a scope pattern on the wiring between the coil and PCM. If they were doing this right they would know for sure the problem was in the ignition and wouldn't have been talking about throwing an injector at it. I don't know these guys, all i have to work with is what your posting here, but it sounds like they just threw a coil at it because it was their best guess. Now it gets harder because we don't know if a new problem was caused by a cheap aftermarket coil or sloppy attempts at testing. Accidentally grounding out the low voltage wires at the coil could absolutely damage the PCM and cause a no start problem. If you towed to another shop and they replaced the PCM, they probably could not prove it was the first shops fault. Ask them to put the original coil back on it and maybe it will run long enough to take it to the dealer, if not see if they will tow it to the dealer for you. I think they owe you that much even if they did nothing wrong."
MechanicAdvice,3cjn96,GMUSSTN,4,Wed Jul 8 12:49:53 2015 UTC,"Since the motor works, albeit after some wiggling, I'd be more inclined to think it's a loose wire/bad electrical connection at the motor, as opposed to the motor itself being bad.  I don't know how accessible the motor is on one of those cars, as I've never had to work on one, but see if you can get to the electrical connection and check it for corrosion and/or loose wires.  It's also possible, assuming that the bolts that hold the motor in place act as a ground, that they have backed loose slightly and there is a bad ground connection, which you restore temporarily when you wiggle the motor."

Flip switch and one relay changes to power other stays grounded .  With 2 wire and ground relays are not grounded at all.  Ground comes from ground wire and body and ground wirss body to battery at front of car.  Hint. Pick up a 1/4"" inverted flair union and two 1/4"" inverted flair plugs store the together.

BTW.. with ford central fuel injection.. the green top injectors are for the 3.8 V6 motors.. the dark blue top injectors are for the 5.0 CFI motors and the grey top injectors are for the HO5.0 CFI motors.. 38 pounds, 59 pounds and 62 pounds of fuel per hour FYI.. ."
