If beer snobbery is anything like music hipsters, how ""good"" a beer is is based off the ratio of Quality:Known (Quantity). So a good hipster beer isn't Boston Lager that you can find on tap in Red Lobster even though it is a solid beer, a better selection is their Boston Winter Lager because it's only available 3 months AND extra hops and other bullshit in it. But an even better choice is some local brewery that doesn't have any distribution rights so you have to go to their bar for a growler fill, even if their Winter Lager clone smells like actual bullshit.  BCK and I are so small, we don't even have a brewery name. I know there are around 300 people who are aware of my beer (I think BCK has a blog or something to be more known) because I enter a contest every year that's more for bragging rights than money.

She actually took the brown bag approach and personally spent 20% of her predecessor on gubernatorial matters.  VP Palin had a lifestyle coach, ghost writer, and then hit up makeovers because a ""pig with lipstick"" couldn't look like a pig with lipstick while being the running mate on the national scale.

Mostly because according to you everyone who doesn't suck the Koch votes straight Democrat.   You think you know my voting record? Who did I vote for for the House of Reps in the 6th district in 1988? Huh, smarty pants? You think just because I am a known troll, that I only vote for other trolls? Or just because I hate everything about libtards means I wouldn't vote for one? Get real. Hypocrite.   ""Reality"" like Faux ""News""!   Exactly. If the propoganda Koch-funded media was as dramatic as this sub, it might be worth watching. But there's no plot. It's just a bunch of talking heads when they should be sucking dick. I'm running out of things to say, but this is going to be a paragraph, goddamnit. I am going to Krean your ass on this one.  Come at me, brah. Try to type a longer response. We'll go back and forth for 19 messages contesting how long we can make a single thread without crashing redddit. Bring it on."

And somebody's going to bitch about something environmental.  And the word Koch will appear in both comment sections.  It's going to get worse now that we don't have the Packers or Badgers to distract us. The Brewers don't seem to be doing that yet.  Oh, and /u/KEM10 is spot on with the long game."
WICircleJerk,32fqf0,KEM10,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:12:47 2015 UTC,KEM10's 3 year prediction: You can take it to the bank!  Walker is elected President.  Liberals bitch about it.  Only change WI sees is learning how to spell Kleefish's (?) name as she's now the party's face.  Gets replaced by Democrat because she's only a face.  Republicans bitch about it.  Only difference is /r/Wisconsin is CJ'ing about how moderate the new Gov is and might as well be Republican.  Sky doesn't fall and the only thing to burn to the ground is our hopes and dreams.

But you? You can do that whenever you want without proof?  Looking at the exchange between you and /u/tasteecheese seems like you went personal & damn fast. Can I ask you what's wrong? What has made you so hostile? I think you owe the OP an apology. Instead you ban this account for sticking up for someone.  This is a PM from /u/WinkMe to myself just a minute ago:   It's okay, you don't have to. You're still banned for making an account 2 minutes after I banned tasteecheese.

So asking why a post was removed (by you & not by any other moderator) is arguing? Ok....  Also, you started with the attitude and accused him of vote manipulation first. You definitely did shoot first and ask questions later. And you can't deny that, it's in writing."

Luckily, the usernname tasteecheese was available. I thought that was great and posted on r/madison. I admit the post was a little funny, but I am dead serious that I would try to find a can of Tastee Cheese in Madison. I know we have some Jamaican restaurants and food carts. We also have some great ethinic grocery stores that carry carribean items.   I see no vote manipulation going on here. I mean a I posted a funny video from the company's website.

But this wasn't any conservative, he was a rabid one who toed the party line and ate up the talking points like they were week old Cheetos he found in his neck beard. Now his views weren't anything different than what you'd hear on Faux ""News"" or Charlie SIKE-s, but this is reddit, a bastion of enlightened free thinkers, how can someone with a differing viewpoint jump into this circle? So he developed a reputation and gained followers who would throw downvotes at him like a town pelting a freak with rotten fruit. This man didn't care, he still showed up with the knowledge that Walker won the recall (suck it Libtards!) so he must be on the right path and spread his righteous word of Republican ideals and how fags are totally gay to the non-believers, knowing his reward would trickle down like pennies from heaven or economic stimulus from top tier tax cuts.  But one day, he dared to insult a progressive, lesbian elected official and all of the wise, just (and if I dare say, incredibly handsome) people of this village threw a temper tantrum that could no longer be placated by the Schutzstaffel Mods. Much to their own disarray, they had a public hanging banning of this individual.  However, he was so stubborn righteous, that he rose from his own ashes to continue vomiting talking points and complaining about Baggots (which totally isn't a gay thing, it was a pun please don't ban me ). Eventually, through much steadfast determination of the users of this glorious sub, hunting him down with every new name and face he came up with, he stopped returning.  Some say he got tired of it and is now living on jsonline message boards where there are no mods, some say that the twins who shall not be named stopped paying for his posts, other claim he broke his back trying to fellatiate himself because anyone that anti-gay has to be a fag and with such strong religious beliefs this was the only way to give head. Me, I don't know for sure, but someone that determined and doing this for so long could easily hide among the masses, so it isn't out of the realm of possibilities that he is  RIGHT BEHIND YOU!"

Why would you make this topic when the game is still on? The Chargers are still playing right now and they have been the best team in the AFC West for how many years now? They're playing one of the worst teams in the NFL who just happen to have a lead because they're feeding off the energy of playing in a Monday Night Game. But you know what? They still fucking suck. The Chargers are one of the best fucking teams in the NFL, they went 13-3 last year and would of won the Super Bowl if the kicker didn't choke. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you're going to be embarrassed when the Chargers wins and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that, the Chiefs just stepped out of bounds short of the 1st down when they needed to get one, just like the Jets did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic?

WICircleJerk,2gvdrt,no_soul_ginger,0,Sat Sep 20 02:11:04 2014 UTC,"TOB simulation:  You're wrong.  Out of love and concern for the truth, and with the object of eliciting it, the following heads will be the subject of a public discussion at Wittenberg under the presidency of the reverend father, Martin Luther, Augustinian, Master of Arts and Sacred Theology, and duly appointed Lecturer on these subjects in that place. He requests that whoever cannot be present personally to debate the matter orally will do so in absence in writing.  When our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, said ""Repent"", He called for the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.  The word cannot be properly understood as referring to the sacrament of penance, i.e. confession and satisfaction, as administered by the clergy.  Yet its meaning is not restricted to repentance in one's heart; for such repentance is null unless it produces outward signs in various mortifications of the flesh.  As long as hatred of self abides (i.e. true inward repentance) the penalty of sin abides, viz., until we enter the kingdom of heaven.  The pope has neither the will nor the power to remit any penalties beyond those imposed either at his own discretion or by canon law.  The pope himself cannot remit guilt, but only declare and confirm that it has been remitted by God; or, at most, he can remit it in cases reserved to his discretion. Except for these cases, the guilt remains untouched.  God never remits guilt to anyone without, at the same time, making him humbly submissive to the priest, His representative.  The penitential canons apply only to men who are still alive, and, according to the canons themselves, none applies to the dead.  Accordingly, the Holy Spirit, acting in the person of the pope, manifests grace to us, by the fact that the papal regulations always cease to apply at death, or in any hard case.  It is a wrongful act, due to ignorance, when priests retain the canonical penalties on the dead in purgatory.  When canonical penalties were changed and made to apply to purgatory, surely it would seem that tares were sown while the bishops were asleep.  In former days, the canonical penalties were imposed, not after, but before absolution was pronounced; and were intended to be tests of true contrition.  Death puts an end to all the claims of the Church; even the dying are already dead to the canon laws, and are no longer bound by them.  Defective piety or love in a dying person is necessarily accompanied by great fear, which is greatest where the piety or love is least.  This fear or horror is sufficient in itself, whatever else might be said, to constitute the pain of purgatory, since it approaches very closely to the horror of despair.  There seems to be the same difference between hell, purgatory, and heaven as between despair, uncertainty, and assurance.  Of a truth, the pains of souls in purgatory ought to be abated, and charity ought to be proportionately increased.  Moreover, it does not seem proved, on any grounds of reason or Scripture, that these souls are outside the state of merit, or unable to grow in grace.  Nor does it seem proved to be always the case that they are certain and assured of salvation, even if we are very certain ourselves.  Therefore the pope, in speaking of the plenary remission of all penalties, does not mean ""all"" in the strict sense, but only those imposed by himself.  Hence those who preach indulgences are in error when they say that a man is absolved and saved from every penalty by the pope's indulgences.  Indeed, he cannot remit to souls in purgatory any penalty which canon law declares should be suffered in the present life.  If plenary remission could be granted to anyone at all, it would be only in the cases of the most perfect, i.e. to very few.  It must therefore be the case that the major part of the people are deceived by that indiscriminate and high-sounding promise of relief from penalty.  The same power as the pope exercises in general over purgatory is exercised in particular by every single bishop in his bishopric and priest in his parish.  The pope does excellently when he grants remission to the souls in purgatory on account of intercessions made on their behalf, and not by the power of the keys (which he cannot exercise for them).  There is no divine authority for preaching that the soul flies out of the purgatory immediately the money clinks in the bottom of the chest.  It is certainly possible that when the money clinks in the bottom of the chest avarice and greed increase; but when the church offers intercession, all depends in the will of God.  Who knows whether all souls in purgatory wish to be redeemed in view of what is said of St. Severinus and St. Pascal? (Note: Paschal I, pope 817-24. The legend is that he and Severinus were willing to endure the pains of purgatory for the benefit of the faithful).  No one is sure of the reality of his own contrition, much less of receiving plenary forgiveness.  One who bona fide buys indulgence is a rare as a bona fide penitent man, i.e. very rare indeed.  All those who believe themselves certain of their own salvation by means of letters of indulgence, will be eternally damned, together with their teachers.  We should be most carefully on our guard against those who say that the papal indulgences are an inestimable divine gift, and that a man is reconciled to God by them.  For the grace conveyed by these indulgences relates simply to the penalties of the sacramental ""satisfactions"" decreed merely by man.  It is not in accordance with Christian doctrines to preach and teach that those who buy off souls, or purchase confessional licenses, have no need to repent of their own sins.  Any Christian whatsoever, who is truly repentant, enjoys plenary remission from penalty and guilt, and this is given him without letters of indulgence.  Any true Christian whatsoever, living or dead, participates in all the benefits of Christ and the Church; and this participation is granted to him by God without letters of indulgence.  Yet the pope's remission and dispensation are in no way to be despised, for, as already said, they proclaim the divine remission.  It is very difficult, even for the most learned theologians, to extol to the people the great bounty contained in the indulgences, while, at the same time, praising contrition as a virtue.  A truly contrite sinner seeks out, and loves to pay, the penalties of his sins; whereas the very multitude of indulgences dulls men's consciences, and tends to make them hate the penalties.   So you see, you're wrong.  Also, I noticed that once he logged on today, all my comments got -2 votes. Anyone else have that experience?"

And yet oddly seem less informed than a number of the participants there.  Again, point stands. You're hi fiving a well known troll (or someone's impersonation of it) while you bailed out of modding because you were a coward. You were doing okay, but somehow playing the martyr of the ""misunderstood conservative"" suits you better. So you went as far as enabling flair for the subreddit, and then you just kind of sat there and then whined about how a troll and Metalmudd's comments we're being treated equally.  Wisconsin deserves better than the collective efforts that some people have made. I just have to laugh that I'm just one guy, not one that even comments a fraction that other people do, one that says things that generally have the support of the community, but instead a couple of dejected ex-mods and a few other of their hangers on have to pretend they are relevant here.  Whatever floats your boat."

The double standards of the sub made me sick and all of us were completely bogged down by trying to be fair with every showing we made and ended up talking about it for hours before actions occurred just for the hope that we wouldn't piss you guys off. It was too much because simply signing on became tiring and every modmail was 1 of 2 things:   This person shouldn't have been warned because I agree with them.

What is ridiculous about that statement is both Metalmudd and I (and others) would call out the same people, but you're here hanging out in his circle jerk yet criticize me. He would call out the fact that ALL the mods were slow on the update to deal with the obvious problem again and again not simply for people who had a right lean.  What is crap about that statement is that I'd upvote and support you, and madtownWI and azbug (for different reasons) and others who got the blowback problem from the original troll. And the thanks for that, is you jokers will shit on me, and then kid around with some of the other people here. That's being a huge fucking hypocrite when at one time or another we all were battling the same problem.  And for the record, I did try the strategy, which I discussed with Metalmudd back when you know who was back around again, to stick to the topic and try to leave the troll acknowledgement to a minimum. He'd be happy to PM me ""hey, nice job"" while then taking pot shots at me here. You seem to be in a similar camp. For the record both of us (him and I) reported legit stuff to keep an eye on and once again the community was left to deal with it although either those accounts did delete at some point or were shadowbanned.   The double standards of the sub made me sick    That's a load of crap. Sure there were a couple people who could cast a wider net, but no, you want this pre-Reaganesue ""fairness doctrine"" for anyone who is remotely conservative rather than cleaning your own house and taking those to task on your own side. Why do you think I'm critical of CB? Not just that he sucked as a mod, but that he is generally disingenuous about the position he claims to represent. But no, the rest of you will cling to Belmont and still buoy him up. Which is why I can't take seriously and supposed ""double standard"".   we made and ended up talking about it for hours before actions occurred just for the hope that we wouldn't piss you guys off.    Most subs don't require that level of deliberation. Plenty have troll problems. This is the only sub that I've ever seen in 7 years that has had such a problem.   You're seeing the stress levels that are there because SFG was the second most active mod and she's crumbling under the pressure.    And yet you are here laughing with the people who shit all over her. I at least was fair with my criticism and told her as such. Too bad she's gone. She at least improved her position over time and did what none of the rest of you seemed to be able to do and that is evolve her policy to include intent. She at least stood up to the troll and said his bigotry at the time wouldn't be welcome, and didn't dance around bullshit ""rules"" to hide behind. She did however harass off mnpilot, but its funny that Metalmudd complained 10x more about the same situation. Just sayin.   The people there are sick and just about everyone takes it too seriously.   Yeah, and if back since 2010 just one mod had taken their job seriously and done what amounts to pretty trivial work to keep things in order, none of this would be like it is today. The only reason I may be more vocal than most, is I got tired of getting swept under the carpet and trying to be a decent guy about it.   You included.   You too."

WICircleJerk,2gvdrt,tob_krean,0,Sat Sep 20 18:05:30 2014 UTC,"Papal indulgences should only be preached with caution, lest people gain a wrong understanding, and think that they are preferable to other good works: those of love.  Christians should be taught that the pope does not at all intend that the purchase of indulgences should be understood as at all comparable with the works of mercy.  Christians should be taught that one who gives to the poor, or lends to the needy, does a better action than if he purchases indulgences.  Because, by works of love, love grows and a man becomes a better man; whereas, by indulgences, he does not become a better man, but only escapes certain penalties.  Christians should be taught that he who sees a needy person, but passes him by although he gives money for indulgences, gains no benefit from the pope's pardon, but only incurs the wrath of God.  Christians should be taught that, unless they have more than they need, they are bound to retain what is only necessary for the upkeep of their home, and should in no way squander it on indulgences.  Christians should be taught that they purchase indulgences voluntarily, and are not under obligation to do so.  Christians should be taught that, in granting indulgences, the pope has more need, and more desire, for devout prayer on his own behalf than for ready money.  Christians should be taught that the pope's indulgences are useful only if one does not rely on them, but most harmful if one loses the fear of God through them.  Christians should be taught that, if the pope knew the exactions of the indulgence-preachers, he would rather the church of St. Peter were reduced to ashes than be built with the skin, flesh, and bones of the sheep.  Christians should be taught that the pope would be willing, as he ought if necessity should arise, to sell the church of St. Peter, and give, too, his own money to many of those from whom the pardon-merchants conjure money.  It is vain to rely on salvation by letters of indulgence, even if the commissary, or indeed the pope himself, were to pledge his own soul for their validity.  Those are enemies of Christ and the pope who forbid the word of God to be preached at all in some churches, in order that indulgences may be preached in others.  The word of God suffers injury if, in the same sermon, an equal or longer time is devoted to indulgences than to that word.  The pope cannot help taking the view that if indulgences (very small matters) are celebrated by one bell, one pageant, or one ceremony, the gospel (a very great matter) should be preached to the accompaniment of a hundred bells, a hundred processions, a hundred ceremonies.  The treasures of the church, out of which the pope dispenses indulgences, are not sufficiently spoken of or known among the people of Christ.  That these treasures are not temporal are clear from the fact that many of the merchants do not grant them freely, but only collect them.  Nor are they the merits of Christ and the saints, because, even apart from the pope, these merits are always working grace in the inner man, and working the cross, death, and hell in the outer man.  St. Laurence said that the poor were the treasures of the church, but he used the term in accordance with the custom of his own time.  We do not speak rashly in saying that the treasures of the church are the keys of the church, and are bestowed by the merits of Christ.  For it is clear that the power of the pope suffices, by itself, for the remission of penalties and reserved cases.  The true treasure of the church is the Holy gospel of the glory and the grace of God.  It is right to regard this treasure as most odious, for it makes the first to be the last.  On the other hand, the treasure of indulgences is most acceptable, for it makes the last to be the first.  Therefore the treasures of the gospel are nets which, in former times, they used to fish for men of wealth.  The treasures of the indulgences are the nets which to-day they use to fish for the wealth of men.  The indulgences, which the merchants extol as the greatest of favours, are seen to be, in fact, a favourite means for money-getting.  Nevertheless, they are not to be compared with the grace of God and the compassion shown in the Cross.  Bishops and curates, in duty bound, must receive the commissaries of the papal indulgences with all reverence.  But they are under a much greater obligation to watch closely and attend carefully lest these men preach their own fancies instead of what the pope commissioned.  Let him be anathema and accursed who denies the apostolic character of the indulgences.  On the other hand, let him be blessed who is on his guard against the wantonness and license of the pardon-merchant's words.  In the same way, the pope rightly excommunicates those who make any plans to the detriment of the trade in indulgences.  It is much more in keeping with his views to excommunicate those who use the pretext of indulgences to plot anything to the detriment of holy love and truth.  It is foolish to think that papal indulgences have so much power that they can absolve a man even if he has done the impossible and violated the mother of God.  Phone apps are unstable?

He used to Sub to mechwarrior pages, he had an Alt-account with mechwarrior references.  TrialofPosition is again a mechwarrior referenced name.  Similar rhetoric, similar vehement approach, and same lack of source\substance with opinionated rubbish.  Not to mention, Belmont is confirmed to live in Dane County."
WICircleJerk,2dni1q,tob_krean,10,Fri Aug 15 20:55:15 2014 UTC,"Since this is WCJ, I'll speak candidly. Of course it is likely him. Both you and I and a few others have a pretty good detector that fires off right away when it is.  But for the hell of it, let it play out. You have a new set of players, see what they do with it. I'm just going to keep responding with facts and logic for as much as I have idle time for and hopefully others do the same.   If he starts repeating himself, just link back to the same previously debunked info. I think its worth a try."

Might be fun to sit back and watch :)    As far as responding to him with facts, I appreciate it in the sense that it allows others to see his vile speech and that it has no-basis nor can it hold up in an factual and intelligent conversation, however, I dislike the noise it creates along with the squabbling that comes with it.  But you're right, it's worth a try."
WICircleJerk,2dni1q,mnpilot,9,Fri Aug 15 21:30:19 2014 UTC,"As far as responding to him with facts... ...the noise it creates along with...   Understood and agree, but perhaps let's try to help everyone keep noise to a minimum. We all agree ignoring never works no matter how often it is mistakenly proposed, even the best don't and the worst never will.  So people have two options, facts, then ignore. Stick to both of those as much as possible and people not only may help squelch disingenuous talk, but it gives each other more factual ammo for their own colorful characters they meet. It takes a little discipline by a few people, but I'm ready to raise the level of substance again if others are too. It used to be what I practiced all the time and then I got out of practice when much of the nonsense broke loose.  So let's just see how this goes and bury old hatchets while it plays out."
WICircleJerk,2dni1q,ImAFuckingTroll,4,Fri Aug 15 21:36:27 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure, the first ""Huh?"" had me thinking.  The pattern started to fit, then as I said in a message to the mods, time will tell.  The recent union v ALEC thread is about as close to confirmation as it gets.  While I don't exclude the possibility that there are ""n+1"" Wisconsin citizens who will shamelessly rationalize and willfully ignore facts when it comes to Herr Walker and crew, the chances of similar language, style, and pattern of response are too much to ignore.  Oh, timing, can't forget about timing."
WICircleJerk,2dni1q,PeanutTheGladiator,3,Sun Aug 17 17:38:30 2014 UTC,"He does have a ""partner"" now, so maybe the homophobic responses will be absent from this current form of the Belmont.    I see the same old same old blind following of Walker is still alive and well.    But, as with all incarnations of the Belmont, all roads lead to him going off the wagon and spouting something racist or whatnot and then we will start the next ModWar.  Just make sure to follow the rules as told by Shitforguns:  No saying the T word,  no calling names if you are a supposed liberal, and don't be a CB.    That is all.  Good day."
