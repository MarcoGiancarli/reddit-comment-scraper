I've seen it before - basically it can be any item in game. What happens is  the server sees those packets as ""transactions"". Meaning your client communicating to the server. As in the money of your character increasing incredibly fast. Nothing to worry about, just basically saying ""whatever you're doing, you're doing it too often and it could cause issues"" (e.g. disconnecting, lag, etc). I wouldn't worry about it.

Run forward, go up the stairs on your right, then head left to take out  the ""non mission critical"" guard. Turn around and head towards the paved lot area. One sniper kill of the single guard on the platform, then back to assault rifle. Move closer and take out the guard standing near the jeep, then the guard that is kneeling. Take out the two scientists that are near the previous two guards. Now walk into the paved area and towards the target. Take out the single guard on the right side of the lot. Wait for the two scientists to start walking towards the target then take them out from behind. Make sure the guard on the platform, up and to the left, has his back turned then take out the scientist and guard beside the Humane Labs truck. Take out the final guard on the platform.

GTAV,3dxx8y,chad_daddy_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"That's the rule with my heist crew haha, everyone starts off at 25%, anyone dying loses 5% cut."
GTAV,3dxx8y,lords8n,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"You can play it whatever way you like. 55/15/15/15 = 317/226/226/226 giving the host 91K more than the three others. 40/20/20/20 = 216/260/260/260 giving each player 44K more than the host. This considers heist cost and setup awards. I'd rather keep my crew happy, make some friends, and get payback later when they host a heist and invite me.    If i'm not mistaken I believe Humane Labs gives the most extra to the players @ 40/20/20/20. I believe all others are closer to even at that split.    Personally I like to see if the host has the character to offer the fairer 40/20/20/20. Then I usually tell him to just give me 5% and split the remaining 15% among the others.    To me...anyone that offers 55/15/15/15 is a cheap bastard. And ""I just leave it the way it is"" is no excuse to me. And my crew may even see this and the leader does this all the time and it eeks my shit. I don't care...pay your crew and don't be lazy or cheap."

A lot of the missions look really fun too (like Air Force One), but I wouldn't know because I never get a full game.  I also get dropped from games, and ""unable to join"" messages a lot, and it's not a connection issue.  Also hackers, and griefers are still pretty problematic. Now I'm not just whining about being killed in free-mode. I'm talking about trying to leave your garage and having huge shipping crates in your way. Or when you're trying to play a mission and a guy is just trying to hit other players with his car, or is just AFK.  Also, (and this is no one's fault really) there's too many kids!!! I mean, I don't want to sound like a grumpy old fart, but I'm always getting friend requests, and when I accept them, and they have a mic I find out they're -10 years old.  Now, I'm all for kids wasting their time playing video games, but they're usually not very good, and just want to play the same mission over and over, or do some other incredibly tedious thing to do a glitch or something like that.

Players would just get off the bikes at the start, do the swimming and running sections (you can still hit checkpoints on foot), then at the proper checkpoint for the bike section, respawn to get a bike back. You could only do it with friends or people willing to follow the intent, though, otherwise they'd just use a bike for the running section or attack the other players."

If you stick around for a few minutes and kill some peds (there are no police) you can get up to around $22k. If you do it with randoms many of them like to use buzzards and get it over quickly which is an option but you'll take a hit for the payout. I've gotten up to 6-7k less doing it that way. Another good solo job is ""Hard Labor"". Not as lucrative as the former but still good $$$ and fun. Other than that the modded Sentinel still spawns near the Eclipse Towers. One sells for a little over 14k and the other for 17k+."

GTAV,3dvqb4,gtschida1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"I say Heists only if you are not hosting, I usually get short changed because the setup cost is sorta pricey. I don't really care for money though, I'm always taking the lowest cut or no cut because I know people need it more than I do. You can knock out missions quickly if you know your way around them and you can make 100k in around an hour maybe less, It depends on how good you are. Ive met people who can knock out Pacific Standard in under an hour. Just get comfortable with one heist or a mission then spam it, Daily Objectives are a really good way to make money in the long run, if you do them for the entire month, at the end of the month you get paid 500k, now if you have two characters and do Daily Objectives on both? You'll be pulling in 1M for about 20 minutes of work each day. And the 500k isn't the total amount from doing the objectives, its just a bonus that R* gives you for being awesome."
