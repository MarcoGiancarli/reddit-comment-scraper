Seems to have a less glossy finish than I hoped but still looks pretty damn good.

AnimeFigures,3dr19r,trijohn,7,Sat Jul 18 17:00:53 2015 UTC,"I've been twice. It's phenomenally easy if you go to Akiba - most of the shops there sell anime and manga stuff, whether it's books, figures, costumes, merch, etc. No point in going with a set list of shops to visit - just roam up and down the main drag going into every shop and looking for bargains."
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,klipson,3,Sat Jul 18 17:09:38 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Any bootleg concern doing that? Are there any large reputable figure stores?
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,rakevinwr,8,Sat Jul 18 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"There are many large figure stores, afaik, biggest one is Kotobukiya in Akiba. Don't worry about bootlegs, because there aren't any bootlegs at all."
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,Alhail99,7,Sat Jul 18 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"They don't sell bootlegs. If it's on sale in Akiba, it's legit. Also you're better off going to the smaller stores for better deals."
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,klipson,3,Sat Jul 18 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"I've seen bootlegs in second hand shops, however they are clearly marked as fake. Which is interesting since its highly illegal.

AnimeFigures,3dr19r,DancingQueen5961,3,Sun Jul 19 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"There is also this place in Nakano, called Nakano Broadway. found a lot of stuff there, mostly second hand, but if you are looking for something specific it is well worth a try!"
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,Ot3n,3,Sat Jul 18 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"There's a guide that was compiled by several members of /r/AnimeFigures that have been to Japan. I would recommend giving it a look.  The one thing I would recommend is avoid buying figures from the display case stores (The ones where a whole store is full of display cases where people can rent out to sell things). The reason is because you will get exactly what you see, which means if you see a figure without a box, you will not get the box if you buy it. Also its mostly targeted for tourists so many of the figures/merch are ridiculously overpriced.  However, I've seen very rare figures there as well. Usually accompanied by a frightening price tag."
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,Weeb_Lyfe,2,Sun Jul 19 00:55:35 2015 UTC,I have to say those are good for gacha/trading figures that are hard to find on sale on the Internet.
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,klipson,3,Sun Jul 19 09:33:00 2015 UTC,I want to give a shout out to Den Den Town in Osaka. The anime shops there were incredible.
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,ddaimyo,2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:16 2015 UTC,I'll second this. I'm surprised the reddit guide did not list Den Den Town. The place is a treasure trove. My gf and I spent 2 days just scavenging back streets and unmarked buildings for delightful stores hidden away. We actually canceled our planned trip to Kyoto so we could allocate more time and money towards exploring Den Den Town.  Yodobashi Camera is great for general Anime and Gashapon figures and Video Games. The place definitely made our wallets lighter.  But Den Den Town? It should be on any collector's itinerary if they're heading to Osaka. I'd recommend having a list of priority targets along with extra cash for an unexpected figure or two that will grab your attention.
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,bearfistsoffurry,3,Mon Jul 20 05:28:06 2015 UTC,"It used to be really fun and bargain to hunt for old and used (‰∏≠Âè§) figures in Akiba, at least it was true for Osaka 2013.   Yet there are too much demands from Chinese tourist lately that most shops marked up crazy that they are baiting now more than actually tryhard to sell.  Its funny you can always find better prices in JP amazon than real shops in most of the Akiba. Jungle still holds a not-very-bad price with tax rebate. Mandarake has always been a treasure cove but it is expensive now not just with the mark up but 8% tax. You can just order off Mandarake online anyway...  I personally find the reddit guide very unhelpful. I have a guide in Chinese going to finish. It will be easy for me to translate it into English.  Just been to Osaka 2013 Nov and Tokyo 2015 Feb together to Wonder Festival Winter with a huge loot."

I was only there a few days, so I planned on shopping there for one day. Spent every day I was there at akihabara. If you don't mind nsfw stuff, they sell those casually as well. Got a few slightly nsfw stuff for my friend that really likes vn."
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,kingofquackz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:14:12 2015 UTC,"Most big electronics stores are going to have some Figures available in the toys section but you'd need to go to whatever otaku area is in the city you're in for the real selection. Also buying already released and used stuff is one thing but the thing you won't get to experience until you actual live here is the preorder process. Big Akihabara stores and other similar places have large boards filled with pictures and preorder tickets for every figure coming out soon, very useful to get up to date with what's coming out.  Most of the time the pickup process is pretty plain, just go to the counter after its released and have them bring it out from the back. Though for more important releases (and this is usually not with figures but Visual Novels and Eroge) they'll set up their event area for a dedicated preorder pickup area with all the preorder bonuses.  Now about just roaming Akiba, if you're visiting thats the thing to do, but if you live here you get to know which stores carry what and you just drop by after work/school hit your preferred stores and are in and out in less than 30m. Espesically true if you came early since every minute you waste is exponentially more people on the JR lines (or if you are like me and just walk 10m to a nearby subway station to avoid the Yamanote line).  And then of course there's the fact that it's almost always cheaper to preorder online.... so like you guys I just preorder my stuff online and have it delivered. Except I have way more choice in shops and usually get free shipping or 500 yen all inclusive next day shipping, and they'll usually ship the figure out the night before so it gets to you the day of release. That and points, points are love, points are life."
AnimeFigures,3dr19r,nar0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:30 2015 UTC,"I've just came back from Japan actually (came back last week) and it is true what they say about Akiba; it is filled with anime stores. Just go into a random store and you'll fine anime figures and merchandise. Tip: Don't impuls buy there too much because you're in Akiba it really isn't much cheaper than would you find online.   I highly recommend visiting Nakano broadway (it's a couple stations away from Akiba station; 15-20 min. with the local and 10 mins with the rapid service). There are a lot smaller stores selling all kinds of stuff and figures. If you're looking for more anime merchandise and not just pricey scale figures, Nakano broadway has a lot of general merchandise like keychains, posters (I've bought a big F/SN promotional poster there for like ‚Ç¨18) and smaller figures like trading figures, petit nendroids etc.   I've bought most of my stuff in Nakano broadway because it was a lot less crowded, it was cheaper and I found stuff I couldn't find in Akiba.   Denden town/Nipponbashi in Osaka is also worth visiting if you're around the area. It's like 15 mins. with the shinkansen (bullet train) from Kyoto central station. If you're taking local trains it will be little bit more tricky. It is like Akiba, maybe a little smaller but still a lot of anime stores. From what I've seen there are alos a lot of card shops, so if you're into that Denden seemed like the place to be."

I placed a big order (around 10 figures), so during checkout i paid for the total amount plus shipping via EMS(cheapest method for me besides Ferry), EMS takes less than a week to arrive while ferry takes around 3 months!. A few days after that they said that they miscalculated the shipping price and that i should pay around 6000 jpy more. I emailed them back that i agree to that. Three weeks passed and they still didn't send an invoice, even though all items are in stock and I contacted them twice about the invoice and still they ignored me. So i got pissed and decided to email them to cancel that order, telling them that I refuse to pay the extra fees that they are asking. Afterwards, they said that they can't cancel any order placed and they decided on their own to ship my items by ferry and refund me the extra shipping fees, as shipping by ferry is much cheaper. So I immediately opened a dispute on paypal. 1 hour later, they cancelled this order and refunded me the whole amount I paid for that order. They also cancelled all of my preorders and banned my account. I no longer intend to get involved with them ever again after that incident."

AnimeFigures,3dp5qq,helloitsumi,2,Sat Jul 18 02:51:51 2015 UTC,Nice Ludger! Can't wait until Alter release their version of him and Julius.   Also a word of warning - you should let your figures out of their boxes ≈ïegularly to breathe or they can 'sweat' plasticiser which can ruin them. They don't live well in boxes for long periods.
AnimeFigures,3dp5qq,klipson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:48:04 2015 UTC,"Nice Collection! Looks amazing.  Alright, so I've heard the word circulating about leaving figures in boxes for periods and the ""sweat"" effect occurring. Do you mind explaining this to me? I have about, eh... 15 figures or so right now, and I usually just keep one on display at a time, just rotating through them display wise you know, and leaving the rest in their respective boxes. Hopefully I'll be able to snag a detolf here soon, but yeah. You guys have me worried!"
AnimeFigures,3dp5qq,astraldickweed,3,Sat Jul 18 09:38:22 2015 UTC,"No problem!   Anime figures are mainly made of PVC, and to make it soft and flexible (as compared to more rigid PVC like Lego bricks) they add a material called plasticiser. Over time, the plasticiser will gradually 'sweat' out of the figures. If your figures are on display, then the plasticiser drifts off into the air, but if they're sealed up in their boxes then it has nowhere to go and it ends up forming a horrible sticky layer over the figure.   This tends to be a problem in older figures more than new ones - the PVC mix is being developed all the time to try and stop this happening. But there's still a risk of sweating, particularly if your figures are subject to extreme temperate fluctuation (luckily I live in the UK and our temperatures are pretty moderate, but even then I open the doors of my Detolfs regularly to let them get good airflow).   So in summary, to avoid sweating:    Try and take your figures out of their boxes as often as possible to let them air.  Don't let them get too hot."

AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,Banagher-Links,2,Sat Jul 18 08:33:17 2015 UTC,"Don't have your set, but from looking cord lengths in the description, you'll probably have to hide the splitter somewhere in the mid-shelf.  From there, you should be able to run each of the 3' cables along the same corner so you get a light bar across the top of each level.  It's not ideal, but it's the best setup I can imagine with those cord lengths.  If you had the splitter on the bottom level, the 3' cables would only go halfway, and the 4"" daisy chain cables would only allow you to run a single vertical bar of lights up the detolf, which might look weird running straight up the center, or only on one side."
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,whut-whut,2,Sat Jul 18 12:06:39 2015 UTC,"Hm these are good suggestions. I hadn't considered running it vertically on the sides. I have two orders for one shelf, so it may turn out alright. I'll have to see how the lighting looks if done that way. Thank you."
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,whut-whut,2,Sat Jul 18 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"With two sets, if you string them vertically up the front two bars, with the lights facing to the back, it might look nice... No LEDs shining right into your face, and both sets lighting up the front of your figures."
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,whut-whut,2,Sat Jul 18 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"So this is what I've mocked up so far. Ignore the loose chains and frog tape, those will be cleaned up when it's all set up. I left the topmost layer blank due to the dud LEDs I received.  (Warning: Pictures are big)  Full shelf  Gundams  Optimus  Pic4  Jason  I think it looks clean so far, very runway like. I do like the single bar stretching across for the shadows, but I can always change it down the line. Thanks for the help and suggestion guys!"
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,rakevinwr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:18 2015 UTC,Looks awesome! It really does have a model runway/photoshoot feel to it. :)
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,rakevinwr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:44:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! Your suggestion definitely made things click. Hopefully this will stay intact through the final set up.
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,rakevinwr,2,Sun Jul 19 19:27:44 2015 UTC,I didn't want to hide the splitter in the cabinet so I put one of my larger statues on the bottom and removed the third shelf. Thought about extending the cords myself but honestly I'll probably go back to the regular dioders.
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,rakevinwr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have many large figures unfortunately to block the splitter :/  Are you okay with the warm white? If so, I guess the dioders would be a better alternative. u/whut-whut mentioned daisy chaining it vertically, which I might give a try"
AnimeFigures,3dpy0a,martijn208,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:17:50 2015 UTC,Yeah that's an interesting idea. I would get two of them then and give that a shot. The warm.white hasn't bothered me much so far it actually seems brighter. I have some pictures of my detolfs in one of my post where one cabinet has the warm white and one has the other dioders.
AnimeFigures,3doy57,lamby130,4,Sat Jul 18 01:41:41 2015 UTC,You'll just have to wait till it goes up on mandarake or some other pre-owned site. Sometimes it's all about timing. Eventhough you can't find one now you might get it at a great price in future. Good luck!

Turns out all I did was place my order on global.rakuten, BUT the seller indicates to me that I must go on Tenso myself and place the order through there. I thought that they would be the ones doing it and not me, but since that's the case, I'll just skip out this time. I mean, I researched more online, and I keep hearing how expensive the service is. I am pretty sure the shipping will end up being the same, if not more, of my total price, and it's not worth it overall for the trouble. I'll just leave these 7 figures be; I only wanted one of them badly, but I can manage and find it elsewhere."
AnimeFigures,3dpcr0,pug_session,2,Sat Jul 18 04:57:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaken that there's a difference between forwarding and a proxy. You want to forward (you used your card for Rakuten), but you expect Tenso to do everything for you which is a proxy. Forwarding is literally doing everything yourself and a proxy is when you don't have to do anything the proxy will do it for you.  I personally recommend FromJapan to proxy. You can just copy and paste the link in their auction or shopping bar which leads you to your cart etc etc. But proxies are expensive indeed, there are a lot of fees."
AnimeFigures,3dpcr0,pug_session,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:11:01 2015 UTC,"I can't find it in their FAQ. But Japanese webstore things, mostly do not accept cancels. I think you cancel, but you don't get a refund of the 7 cheap figures and you probably also have to pay for the domestic shipping cost."

He's a lovely big 1/7, fabulously expressive, and I love the thoughtful little references to the different routes of his game in the base.  GSC's Deep Sea Miku. I won't buy a Miku unless the pigtails really appeal to me (hence why I only have 3 Mikus!) but I love her hair. It feels really oceanic and fits the theme perfectly, and the base sets the whole scene.  Max Factory's Kongou half damage version. I told myself for ages that KanColle was ridiculous and then I fell in love with Kongou... I wish Max Factory would do a regular version (they're my favourite figure company), but until then, half damage it is! Kotobukiya's Akira damage version. This version was limited and I just love him - good male figures are so hard to find!  Besides, Togainu no Chi started my obsession with Nitro+Chiral games... Wing's Rock and Roll Valentine Sonico. I love all Sonicos (I own 19 Sonico figures and counting, plus shitloads of Sonico merch) but she's one of my favourites. She's having so much fun!    Picking just five is so hard! Honourable mentions go to Max Factory's Waitress Mugi, Alter's Yuri Lowell, Kotobukiya's Shiro, Phat's Kirigiri Kyoko, Kotobukiya's CardCaptor Sakura, Union Creative's Makishima Shogo... the list goes on!"

Also, she seems to be going down in price recently after a spate of being quite high, so it's a good time to think about picking her up.   What about your Shiro sculpt was off, if I can ask?

They seem like they might be better at knowing how to repair joints. Hopefully you fix him - I've noticed that my only RAH seems to be quite fragile so I have to be quite gentle with her!"
AnimeFigures,3do7ef,klipson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:45:48 2015 UTC,"The fix should be easy. A piece that holds the shoulder joint in place snapped and I have the pieces so I can glue it back together. The problem is accessing it, I need to find a way to remove the chest armour without breaking it so I can get into the shoulder. I will just have to ask around so I find a safe way to do it."
AnimeFigures,3do7ef,klipson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"Oh I see! Could you use tweezers or needlenose pliers? I can't quite see from the photograph how tight it would be, but from first glance that seems easier than taking off the armour."
AnimeFigures,3do7ef,whut-whut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't, the arm has to go back in first so that the small bar is in place before I can glue the part back on. Once the arm is in I can't see it due to the shoulder armour being in the way."
AnimeFigures,3do7ef,whut-whut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"Someone had something similar happen to their Roy Mustang figure:  http://figurefixer.blogspot.com/2012/06/repairing-broken-rah-joint-roy-mustang.html  The shoulder joint looks very similar in his photo to yours after he took off all the clothes, so you should be able to remove his armor somehow?"
AnimeFigures,3do7ef,siningy,2,Fri Jul 17 23:36:04 2015 UTC,"That repair was for the neck joint, so not of much use to me. Luckily I have managed to remove the armour and glued everything back in place today. Now I just have to wait and see if the glue sets and holds, so far all is good."
AnimeFigures,3do7ef,siningy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:09:22 2015 UTC,Good to hear.  Hope your repair goes well.  It's too cool a figure to stay broken. :)
AnimeFigures,3dn19m,Sirhaian,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:24 2015 UTC,I think it's Dix Neuf from Diebuster.
AnimeFigures,3dn19m,Fluttershybro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:12:11 2015 UTC,Perfect! Thank you. :D  EDIT: That anime looks really nice. I might have to start watching it. \o/

AnimeFigures,3dn19m,materix01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:07 2015 UTC,"Diebuster is actually Aim for the Top! 2, DieBuster sequel to Aim for the Top!, Gunbuster. If you watch both keep in mind the 15 year gap between the prequel and sequel at the end of Diebuster that us older fans went thru."

AnimeFigures,3dn19m,Tsunami3k,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"I know you don't mind some of the poor quality figures since they are cheap. But when it comes to eBay, most fakes are easy to spot if the seller ships from Taiwan or Hong Kong. Or if it says Chinese version anywhere in the info. I've gotten a few of those before and didn't mind at the time, but nothing sucks like finding a real version later on and realizing just how terrible the fakes are in comparison."
AnimeFigures,3dku8d,R4ND0M34,3,Fri Jul 17 02:12:41 2015 UTC,That looks great man! Good job. How did you make it?
AnimeFigures,3dku8d,pt_92,5,Fri Jul 17 03:43:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The main structure was cut out using 3 foam discs; gluing them together then cutting them diagonally. The top was then covered with a snow mixture comprising of water, woodland scenics snowflock and PVA glue. Then I sprayed the whole thing with Scenic cement before doing a complete dusting of the snow flock and then finally spraying another layer of scenic cement. Dried overnight and I'm very happy with the outcome. :D"
AnimeFigures,3dku8d,whut-whut,2,Fri Jul 17 03:51:28 2015 UTC,I made two because I've preordered the suntan version aswell :D
AnimeFigures,3dku8d,vietnoboi,2,Fri Jul 17 02:13:26 2015 UTC,Nice. It really has the visual feel of soft snowpack on top of ice.  Definitely an awesome DIY base. :)

AnimeFigures,3dlhf4,Dylthenoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:46:34 2015 UTC,I see. I felt that they kinda messed up kotoris Nendoroids though. I always the face plates could have been better. And I hope they make the other girls too! That'll be great to complete the set. Too bad they will probably never make shido...
AnimeFigures,3dlhf4,Dylthenoise,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:17:01 2015 UTC,I want the twins as nendos.....
AnimeFigures,3dlhf4,Rifful,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:02 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to get a few, especially the left and right. I just haven't gotten around to watching the anime so I can't justify buying them just yet. They look so cute!"
AnimeFigures,3dlhf4,Rifful,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:37 2015 UTC,The anime is not that bad. Unless you have a strong hate for harems. You should get Yoshino (left) soon. The price for her seems pretty decent now since she just got rereleased. However I can't say that for tohka(right). Her price is ridiculous I got her for around 80 90 USD IIRC
AnimeFigures,3dlmdx,alan2500,8,Fri Jul 17 07:07:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. Figmas also have the benefit of all being 1:12 scale, so almost all scaled doll and action figure items out there (weapons, food, furniture, dollhouse dioramas) also work with them.   Nendoroids are roughly 1:16 for their body/hand size, so accessories are rarer, other than what other Nendoroids have, but you can use Sylvanian Families and Pose Skeleton brand doll items with them."
AnimeFigures,3dlmdx,whut-whut,4,Fri Jul 17 08:44:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you, i did not even consider using items from other brands. I am going to go with figma, since i also want Hunter x Hunter figures (Just bought Kurapika, sorry that you are not my first anyway Princess) and they are not available as Nendoroids. The struggle is real."
AnimeFigures,3dlmdx,whut-whut,3,Fri Jul 17 09:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, tell me about it. :)  Enjoy your choice!  You can't go wrong with either, really... Figmas are awesome in how compatible they are with everything if you want to mess around with how you display them, while Nendoroids are just pure cuteness pressed into plastic."
AnimeFigures,3dlmdx,Chiriesz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:34:10 2015 UTC,"The Pose Skeleton stuff can be hit-or-miss for nendoroids, as some of it is too small.  Sylvanian Families items seem to be pretty much perfect though."
AnimeFigures,3dlmdx,Atheisticles,3,Sat Jul 18 20:17:08 2015 UTC,On a side note: Be honest to yourself if you really like figma joints :) I used to collect figma because I liked posing but it soon grew to liking details of the character more than variable posing.   Then on did I switch to scale figures.
AnimeFigures,3dlmdx,When_Ducks_Attack,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"I plan on getting scale figures at some point, with my small amount of money though, its not gonna be any time soon. While the joints do stand out at times, and can be a bit annoying to look at, i do not really mind, and think that the posing outweighs that con. I just bought Okabe and Kurisu (white coat) figmas, and i am really looking forward to mess around with some poses for them."
AnimeFigures,3dlmdx,When_Ducks_Attack,2,Fri Jul 17 15:12:36 2015 UTC,"One note: somewhere around Figma #200 they changed the way the hands work.  As a result, you can't use old-style hands with newer Figmas.  Shouldn't be much of a problem otherwise, though."
AnimeFigures,3dl1ww,ADJ_Reflex,5,Fri Jul 17 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Can't stop, won't stop! :P   On a side note, I don't think keeping those nendos on your Xbox is good for them on the long run cause of the heat."
AnimeFigures,3dl1ww,RockingaLibrary,4,Fri Jul 17 09:07:51 2015 UTC,Got Maki and Umi on pre-order and Akari in the mail. When does the ride end?

AnimeFigures,3dl1ww,lolimayoi,2,Fri Jul 17 04:52:45 2015 UTC,Agreed 100%. Yui and Chinatsu totally deserve one. I wouldn't mind an Ayano or Sakurako as well while they're at it. :')

AnimeFigures,3dll6j,Draigg836,5,Fri Jul 17 06:52:44 2015 UTC,"Out of this, Koto's and Amakuni's I'd say this is easily the worst Hestia. Plus with it being a new company aswell I don't have high expectations of her. The hair looks so bad imo."
AnimeFigures,3dll6j,nazario1996,3,Fri Jul 17 09:53:57 2015 UTC,Look at the hair. Lazy to make something a little more detail?
AnimeFigures,3dll6j,Atheisticles,2,Fri Jul 17 14:52:24 2015 UTC,New company with pretty good prototypes so far. Their first figure comes out in August so we can see the general consensus by then.  For now I'll hold off personally. Already have the Koto and Amakuni one on PO.

AnimeFigures,3djyya,nazario1996,4,Thu Jul 16 22:09:02 2015 UTC,I believe taito is making a yuuki figure.
AnimeFigures,3djyya,Joseph1917,7,Thu Jul 16 22:09:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely neat that a Yuuki figure is coming out, but I already have several preorders for this November and December, I just can't afford to add this on as well!

AnimeFigures,3djyya,Ao_Sora,7,Thu Jul 16 21:52:27 2015 UTC,"I don't like the detachable skirt either, considering her tragic story, it kind of feels disrespectful"
AnimeFigures,3djyya,RainbowDragon,0,Fri Jul 17 01:24:41 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I was like why would they do that to this poor girl man =/ In the show it never came off so why now?
AnimeFigures,3djyya,Zilveari,3,Fri Jul 17 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"Because Otaku.  They cater to their clients, and they know what their clients want."
AnimeFigures,3djyya,BrownSugarSandwich,6,Fri Jul 17 14:03:41 2015 UTC,Me. I don't like it at all. I think I'll be waiting. Maybe. I mean I guess it's my choice to take it off. But I would prefer it just be one solid figure. Edit: fiancee likes her so I guess that's that.
AnimeFigures,3djyya,cyberrdrake,-2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:32 2015 UTC,You really laid down the law it sounds like.
AnimeFigures,3djyya,BrownSugarSandwich,2,Fri Jul 17 04:45:38 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm not paying for it, but amiami is in my name so I'm ordering it. He then realized like two hours later that you can take her skirt off. We may end up selling it if we don't like it in person. But yeah. I'm not a huge fan of any of the characters, but she will look nice next to the yui figure I got him for Christmas a while ago."

EDIT: Judging by a quick image search (that I backed RIGHT the fuck out of since I'm at work) they make some pretty ecchi figs.   Probably the reason for the detachable skirt.  They know what their fans want.

AnimeFigures,3dk787,johnnyhasnocheese,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:42 2015 UTC,Seems about average price for a figma to me. But inc delivery and potential taxes...abit much.
AnimeFigures,3dk787,vietnoboi,2,Fri Jul 17 09:37:16 2015 UTC,In solarisjapan you can decide if you want to undervalue the total of the package on the.. thingy that.. i totally forgot what is.. haha ive used solarisjapan for that very reason on some expensive figures and it worked like a charm~! edit: i actually bought my own kirito figma from them:)
AnimeFigures,3dk787,ManlyManHero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:23:50 2015 UTC,I took it down to 35 quid from 87 quid.  What was your total and then marked price?
AnimeFigures,3dk787,vietnoboi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"when i bought it aaaaaround 70-USD in total, i think, if the google-converter is right XD. I put it around 30-35 on the invoice too(i remembered what it was called now yey)"
AnimeFigures,3dk787,ManlyManHero,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"Haha my fib is abit bigger. I wonder if customs will be fooled.  Hope so, it's a 20% tax on figures in the UK."
AnimeFigures,3dk787,vietnoboi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"they havnt caught my orders yet so 8D i live in norway and its 25% on the total value of the package if its above 40'ish dollars + the post office fee (17'ish dollars) when they tax it for you, but everything beneath is free of any of those fees. is it 20% on any value there??"
AnimeFigures,3dk787,ManlyManHero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:18 2015 UTC,Yep. I think the law changed last year to include all values. Before it was goods above ¬£40 I believe.
AnimeFigures,3dk787,vietnoboi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"I've never been caught on the ones I've fibbed about, I've put some at under ¬£15, the cut off point, and they don't seem to care. NipponYasan even sent me some stuff marked at ¬£10 even though I never asked or knew they did it and no ones said anything. My most expensive was a 1/4 freeing figure who was in a pretty huge box at about ¬£100 and I put it down to ¬£20ish and they never said a word. Bought a figma once at ¬£30, forgot to put the friendly invoice on and had to pay tax even though it was a tiny box. I don't understand the system at all. Oddly aswell they've never said anything about my Amiami purchases yet, despite the prices being all over the place."
AnimeFigures,3dk787,nazario1996,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:47 2015 UTC,"Cheers for this. Next time I order, I'm putting it under ¬£15.   May I ask when was the last time you placed it under ¬£15?  The one you put to ¬£20ish, tax on that?"
AnimeFigures,3dk787,vietnoboi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the exact date but sometime last month was one I placed under ¬£15, I ordered a Medaka figure, I never purchase the fastest shipping though so I'm not sure if that factors into anything. The ¬£30 figma that I paid tax on came last week was Asuna, again though that wasn't the fastest shipping either.   And nope I didn't have to pay tax on the ¬£20ish, I also didn't use the faster shipping on that one. I've also only ever bought one figure at a time from solarisjapan too, so maybe the quantity effects it too, really not sure.    I honestly don't mind the tax that much when I do have to pay it, its the damn handling fee parcelforce like to slap on stuff that pisses me off."
AnimeFigures,3dk787,nazario1996,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"Man now I feel like a fool for marking mine at ¬£35!  I went fast shipping. It was a ¬£5 difference. So hopefully I don't get slapped with a handling fee.  Thanks for the info mate, really helpful stuff."
AnimeFigures,3dk787,vietnoboi,3,Sat Jul 18 00:31:31 2015 UTC,Use FigInStock or Mandarake's alert list and add „Ç≠„É™„Éà Figma or Figma 174 or just „Ç≠„É™„Éà as keywords. Managed to snag one with this for 3500 JPY.
AnimeFigures,3dk787,lightningmaid,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:41:35 2015 UTC,"There's a risk of getting a bootleg Kirito if you payed just 3500 yen lol, unless it's a trusted source."

AnimeFigures,3dk787,lightningmaid,2,Fri Jul 17 12:35:37 2015 UTC,While there have been cases of a bootleg from Mandarake they have been extremely rare. In fact I dont know how much more trusted you can get when it comes to secondhand figure purchases when it comes from Mandarake.

AnimeFigures,3dhl3v,ttchoubs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:17 2015 UTC,I like the asukas from Sega but I haven't been able to find a good Rei prize anywhere. The faces are dealbreakers for me
AnimeFigures,3diksp,Sususudip,2,Thu Jul 16 15:45:31 2015 UTC,When I see people post it sometimes it looks pretty good. I don't personally have it so idk what to tell you other than it doesn't look bad to me. It's no black heart figure.
AnimeFigures,3diksp,Slippery_Fat_Man,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:26 2015 UTC,I own this figure and the quality is to notch. I have no regrets. What kind of poor quality are people saying?
AnimeFigures,3diksp,Rath1on,2,Thu Jul 16 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"that it was sticky and could be unbalanced, I was skeptical but wanted to be certain"
AnimeFigures,3diksp,whut-whut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"Stickiness and unbalance sounds like heat exposure.  Figure PVC that's been through heat sweats out chemicals and warps.  If it was sealed while put through heat, the residue is trapped on the figure surface and -is- sticky.  And if the heat warps the figure enough, it could shift its balance and become unstable when standing."
AnimeFigures,3diksp,Rifful,2,Fri Jul 17 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"I was always interested in the series, very popular in anime conventions, especially this girl. Really pretty figurine, maybe I'll get one after watching the ongoing season."

AnimeFigures,3dis19,Animelover4lyf,8,Thu Jul 16 16:38:33 2015 UTC,It's a prize figure http://myfigurecollection.net/item/90166   So:  Prize figure + defect + no box = not worth anything
AnimeFigures,3dis19,heathersaur,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:20 2015 UTC,Probably less than the retail value of that figure which is ~1500 JPY. Defects aren't exactly sort after in the anime figure community.
AnimeFigures,3dis19,materix01,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:42:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. You're aiming for perfection, not imperfections. Even a non painted scale wouldn't go higher, just probably same price because someone would just paint over it."
AnimeFigures,3dis19,Tsukuruya,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:06:35 2015 UTC,"Prize figures, even though by nature are cheap claw machine prizes, can still be worth something, if it's a character rarely made into a figure, or if it's a pose that can't be found on any other figures.  Some collectors would pay for something unique to complete their set.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of Conan figures, and your prize figure shares the exact same pose as this higher end scale figure:  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/198369  So rich collectors would be chasing that figure, and not yours."
AnimeFigures,3dis19,whut-whut,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"That‚Äôs not a scale, it‚Äôs a figFIX, and it‚Äôs only about 3.5 inches tall. ‚ÄúHigher end‚Äù perhaps, in that its pretty much a mini, static figma, but quality wise, I personally think the Sega one is better.  Though maybe I‚Äôm just biased because I hate that Freeing demoted him to a figFIX while ‚Äúthe criminal‚Äù got a full on figma instead.  Still, I agree that he wasn‚Äôt worth much to begin with, and even less so without a box‚Ä¶and while that is a very interesting defect, it‚Äôs still a very noticeable visual defect. Maybe look up his current prices and slash 40% off to start?"
AnimeFigures,3dis19,TychoRC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"Bad wording on my part, Tycho. Didn't mean it was a scale statuette, but meant that figures with accurate scaling are more popular with collectors by being more display friendly in collections (GSC's figma/figFIX line is scaled to 1:12, while most collector's statuettes go with 1:8 and bigger, and rarely will there be a non-scale high end statue).  That prize figure still has a value, and maybe slightly more from the mispaint. I was guessing that the desireablity of the figure might be kneecapped by the presence of a very similar Figma, but if Tycho says the Sega is better quality than the Figma Conan (I don't have the Sega prize figure to compare), that might be reason enough for you to keep it at a high price when you shop for a buyer, being ""the best"" of the Conan figures.    There really is no ""wrong"" price, just a wrong audience... It'll sell as long as you find someone who feels it's worth the price you give it."
AnimeFigures,3dis19,whut-whut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see, sorry for the misunderstanding! I definitely agree that the Sega Conan is very weirdly sized. He's huge >.> I'm not some end-all-be-all of quality though, so don't just go by my opinion! The bit about liking the Sega one more is just my personal preference. Like you said, there is no wrong price, just a wrong audience :)"
AnimeFigures,3dis19,TychoRC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:48 2015 UTC,Slash 100% of the value :)

Other times, they may not know the old owner had the GSC direct order bonus.  Two Nendoroids I bought from terraformer had them in the box, sealed.

AnimeFigures,3dfgxm,Ten-kara,2,Thu Jul 16 00:41:37 2015 UTC,I have these two. Miyu leans and her body half split from the sole of her boot which has the peg that holds it to the base. At this point Illya is pretty much holding her up. They are cute together. I had to hunt Miyu down after getting Illya.
AnimeFigures,3dfgxm,Helelix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:18:44 2015 UTC,"I managed to get both off of Manderake. Things I've noticed: Illya is looking a little too downward, colours a dull (but as expected from prize figures) and the paint job on their holding hands is bad (hard to distinguish fingers).   I still like them though :)"
AnimeFigures,3dfgxm,Ten-kara,2,Thu Jul 16 07:30:46 2015 UTC,"I really avoid prize figures now days but the Fate Kaleid series doesn't really have any proper scales besides the cat-costume Illya.

AnimeFigures,3de7r6,BrownSugarSandwich,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:17 2015 UTC,"That's.... A really good idea actually. Never thought of it. I have a few pound bricks of it, if I remember correctly, its about 7 dollars for that size, which is plenty. Plus, Sculpey is really forgiving work wise compared to other poly clays out there."
AnimeFigures,3de7r6,astraldickweed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:47 2015 UTC,"Yep. I've used sculpey for costumes before and it's super easy to work with. And it holds shape well enough when you bake it. If I get white, I have no idea how to add colour, but I know it comes in all sorts of colours, so I will probably just paint extra colours on after and add textures. I thought the pond would be super cute for my Sakura nendroid. And it would be neat to try for making tiers for my trading figs."
AnimeFigures,3de7r6,BrownSugarSandwich,2,Wed Jul 15 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure. umm... Sculpey. Sculpt your preliminary base, etc. Do that. sand, sand, and sand some more with some fine grit stuff if your fingers aren't nimble enough to get the fine/smooth surface you want. also, sanding helps paint adhere to an otherwise impermeable surface. The smoother, the more likely paint isn't going to stick to it. there needs to be some sort of ""grip"" or texture, no matter how fine, between the surface and the paint. Then from there, I would apply a fine coat of spray paint, Montana paints offer a WIDE color field, and are easy to work with. Then, go over it with a flat or matte clear coat. Montana offers those as well. I'm into building gundam models as well, and I usually try to go all all out with those. Takes time, but the effort shows you know!"

Most are fan/amateur made (hence the name) produced in a small amount and aren't officially licensed, but some figure companies have been putting out their own official licensed resin kits."
AnimeFigures,3den2p,whut-whut,2,Wed Jul 15 18:49:44 2015 UTC,They are also much more expensive than pre-painted figures. Most garage kits are only available at the WonFes.
AnimeFigures,3den2p,basketballfan14,4,Wed Jul 15 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"Only available at Wonfes, because like Comiket it's a 1 day open license to sell them.   As mentioned before, they are fan made by both amateurs and by pros."
AnimeFigures,3den2p,DancingQueen5961,2,Wed Jul 15 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"not that I'm planning on going to WonFes any time soon, but when you say they are more expensive, are you referring to their aftermarket price (due to their WonFes exclusivity), or are they just expensive in general right from the start (due to limited numbers and other factors)?"
AnimeFigures,3den2p,heyisjambo,3,Wed Jul 15 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"Most garage kits are more expensive than pre-painted figures. From fellow collectors I know that the prices in general, fluctuate from 100-300‚Ç¨ and sometimes even more based on the kit (400,600 I've even heard for 1000). Of course, there are some kits in normal prices, but only if you attend the WonFes and you're lucky enough to grab one. It's what you say, very small numbers of kits plus the exclusivity. The aftermarket prices are usually very high."

AnimeFigures,3den2p,basketballfan14,2,Wed Jul 15 23:44:58 2015 UTC,"Mod of /r/resinkits here. Everything you wanted to know has pretty much been explained before me, but I should also add that you can obtain recast kits if you're okay with owning bootleg/non original kits. Places like E2046 or GK-Model offer those for a fraction of the cost and also make them widely available for people outside of Japan, while keeping the quality good.  If you want to work with originals only, Y!JA and Mandarake are your best bets. You can find some pretty cheap older kits there and practice on them.  Also, PM me id you want tutorials and/or help on GK painting and building :)"

That sucks but it's good you had Amazon refund you so I wouldn't necessarily say you got scammed. Fake seller prices are generally going to undercut prices of legitimate items so if it seemed too good to be true it probably was.   Looks like this guy on MFC has the best price if it's still available. http://myfigurecollection.net/sale/71065
AnimeFigures,3dfoh9,traxions,2,Wed Jul 15 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"The sale was 3 months ago :/ You can buy here from solaris japan for 125$ new or 95$ used-like new. Also, if a figure is too cheap, it's too good to be true. It applies for 99% of the time in this hobby."
AnimeFigures,3dfoh9,basketballfan14,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing that figure, but it looks like it was posted 3 months ago, and is in ""used"" condition compared to the ""new"" condition I paid for.  Although I was able to get my money back, scamming is defined as a dishonest scheme, or a fraud.  I don't believe this seller had any intention of even sending me what he offered, and therefore was dishonest in offering the figure for sale.  Had I gotten a bootleg version I would have written it off as a bootleg and not a scam.    Thanks for the feedback tho, and I'll be sure to be meticulous in my future purchases! :)"
AnimeFigures,3dfoh9,abysszero,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"This is why most collectors avoid amazon and eBay for old figures, they are great hunting grounds for bootlegs and scams.

AnimeFigures,3dfoh9,klipson,2,Thu Jul 16 06:35:06 2015 UTC,"This. Sellers on Amazon and eBay rely on naive new collectors looking for a bargain, who might not even realise they're getting bootlegs.

AnimeFigures,3dccz1,chearwell,2,Wed Jul 15 11:58:25 2015 UTC,It's Caladbolg II. You can see him fire it against Berserker in one of the first few episodes of the new anime.
AnimeFigures,3dccz1,whut-whut,2,Wed Jul 15 12:06:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I watched it again. I remembered him firing a big drill shaped sword, but missed seeing it transform into the skinny arrow form when he draws back his bow.  I noticed it's shaped a lot like Lancer's Gae Bolg... Probably means there's lore behind their similar name and appearance? Only watched UBW, so I'm guessing I'll probably have to watch Zero to learn about it."
AnimeFigures,3dccz1,chearwell,2,Wed Jul 15 12:32:47 2015 UTC,I don't know much about it but Wikipedia says Caladbolg is sort of a Welsh version of Excalibur. This (from the VN) is about all the information we have on Archer's version.
AnimeFigures,3dccz1,whut-whut,2,Wed Jul 15 12:42:06 2015 UTC,"I looked up the real legend out of curiosity.  It's the sword of the greatest king of Ireland, Fergus, who was the uncle of the greatest warrior of Ireland, cuchulain, (who used the spear gae bolg) and in the show is Lancer.  So caladbolg and gae bolg are related as super weapons of the uncle and nephew team... that's why they both have that corkscrew design in the show."

Did pick up a Kotobukiya Saber Fate/Extra scale figure that was, according to Amazon, in like new condition with everything there, for ~$70 after tax. Gonna be my first scale figure, since most of the ones I've gotten are prize figures that I've picked up while on trips to Japan. And since Kotobukiya directly stocks Amazon with these figures, I'd take a good gander it isn't gonna be a bootleg for once. But can always return if it is one.  Finally gonna break the Asuna/Sinon/Miyuki collection with something different >.<!"

AnimeFigures,3dcedq,pug_session,7,Wed Jul 15 04:21:57 2015 UTC,"Legos is wrong, ""soft"" or ""rubbery"" is also wrong.  They are firm, but generally, depending on the manufacturer, smooth and solid.  PVC is the same stuff they make drainage and household piping out of, so it's very solid.  However figures aren't usually coated with the hard solid coating like plumber's piping, so think of them as solid, but smooth and slightly velvety feeling.   Different manufacturers and different figures have different requirements.  For example, a swimsuit figure is going to have a very ""soft"" feel to them, whereas someone in armor is generally going to be ""crunchy"" and ""solid"" to the surface, if that makes any sense.  It's hard to explain until you have actually experienced what they feel like, but ""squishy"" is definitely not the right way to think of them."
AnimeFigures,3dcedq,ledgekindred,2,Wed Jul 15 04:26:22 2015 UTC,Spot on. I was having difficulties forming my thoughts into text; but this guy's post is exactly what I wanted to say.
AnimeFigures,3dcedq,vietnoboi,4,Wed Jul 15 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"The PVC is generally hard and firm but certain parts are sometimes plasticised for flexibility if it is required in that particular figure. As for texture; there are a few different finishes used including matte and gloss. Really depends on the material the makers are trying to emulate with the PVC. As for ""rubbery"" or ""soft"" probably not words I'd personally describe PVC. PVC isn't rubber. :)"
AnimeFigures,3dcedq,Ten-kara,3,Wed Jul 15 05:00:05 2015 UTC,"Smooth and firm, but not slick like a lego."
AnimeFigures,3dcedq,B-Con,2,Wed Jul 15 04:52:25 2015 UTC,"It's the same material car dashboards are made out of.  You're getting a wide range of descriptions because when making figures, they usually mix in softening chemicals, to give different surfaces different feels.  Just like in a car, figure pvc can be as stiff as your center console pillar, slightly flexible like your air conditioner vent slats, or even 'soft' like the fake leather surfaces on a steering wheel, depending on how much softener they mix in.  Most japanese figures are softer to the touch than Legos, but far from being rubbery or soft.    The softening chemicals are also why it's better to let your figures 'breathe' and air out.  If they're kept in an airtight factory sealed box too long, those softener chemicals sweat out and with nowhere to go, form a sticky layer on the figure."
AnimeFigures,3dcedq,whut-whut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:15:22 2015 UTC,It's almost like that soft-touch plastic you see on some mice and computer cases.
AnimeFigures,3dcedq,Knight-Heart,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"It's hard to describe, they neither 'hard' nor 'soft' to touch, maybe soft-medium and overall quite pleasant, they also can bend a little (particularly arms and legs) but return to their original form unless fixed in place. I didn't do it myself but i have a feeling that if you bend them enough they will snap rather than continue to bend.  I also heard that ""leaning"" figures tend to deform if they left unsupported for a long time but can't say that for myself."

AnimeFigures,3d7uqh,nidyl,2,Tue Jul 14 12:26:37 2015 UTC,Dat price doe :( edit: Preordered nonetheless (why do I do this to myself ;_;)

AnimeFigures,3d6vxz,mtins,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:43:45 2015 UTC,Yep.  I make a lot of effect piece add ons for figures.  You can see more of it   here and here

AnimeFigures,3d6vxz,JWylie15,2,Tue Jul 14 12:36:21 2015 UTC,I hope you have a couple of these up on the next eBay wave! I haven't had any luck with getting previous kamehameha's before they sold out and this one looks great!
AnimeFigures,3d6vxz,CUDesu,2,Tue Jul 14 14:00:38 2015 UTC,"There will be.  The next wave is half Kamehamehas, Half Naruto effects.    I'm working out the balance now on how many of the new style kamehamehas will go up and how many glow ones."

AnimeFigures,3d6dux,sgtdumpty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:15:18 2015 UTC,Haha. Well I'd imagine they'd move their stock relatively well at that price.
AnimeFigures,3d6dux,sgtdumpty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:53:40 2015 UTC,I'd totally buy a DETOLF but I'd have to travel south about 3 hours or pay $350 for it because of shipping.

AnimeFigures,3d795d,OtomeLoveYou,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"Probably not since cupoches and nendos are made from different companies and this is from another company.  Accessories may look good with other figures though since it seems to be chibi sizes, just not body parts."

AnimeFigures,3d78fl,B_r_y_z_e,2,Tue Jul 14 17:51:17 2015 UTC,He's so much more poseable than I expected! Even his hat swooshes in different directions!!!
AnimeFigures,3d78fl,B_r_y_z_e,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:27:21 2015 UTC,I would highly recommend the Link Figma if you don't have it already!

AnimeFigures,3d4byg,lionhearth21,7,Mon Jul 13 12:28:24 2015 UTC,I'm a little disappointed there isn't one where she is wearing her chestplate. Would be so mad if I got her and an armored figure of her was announced.
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,materix01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:59:49 2015 UTC,I'm almost positive you will be able to put on the armor. If it's like tharja you'll be able to take off the head and slip on the additional armor.
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,sgtdumpty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping that you're right, and they're just saving telling us that until the last possible minute to distract us from the excessive cost surprise us."
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,TychoRC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"Me too... But I know I'll get it anyway being a huge FE fan, and her being one of my favorite unit designs."
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,sgtdumpty,3,Tue Jul 14 01:43:22 2015 UTC,Really diggin' the hair! The standing on a pool of water part is still a bit strange to me though :/
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,nidyl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:41:35 2015 UTC,I think that you can also use it without the water effect; it looks nice either way!
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,KarmaCorgi,3,Mon Jul 13 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited for her! I was never a huge Tharja fan, so I'm stoked to finally have a scale of one of the characters I liked! Hopefully she's not too expensive... but I'm not holding my breath >:"
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,TychoRC,2,Mon Jul 13 13:33:57 2015 UTC,Holy crap this is awesome! She'll go well right next to Tharja and hopefully Lucina but with the way that's going she'll arrive sooner.

AnimeFigures,3d4byg,Zeon1234567,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:09:33 2015 UTC,The hair is fantastic. I will probably end up getting her.

AnimeFigures,3d4byg,Cartyx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"Finally! She looks great. I love the colors.  The only weird part is that she's missing her feet with the water effect, but, well, she didn't have feet in the game anyways."
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,talkstomuffintrees,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:01:51 2015 UTC,Yes! My fave girl!
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,invaderark12,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:02:03 2015 UTC,Holy shit she looks super awesome. I'm not sure if I want her though. I'm still holding out on someone making some of the guys at some point though I feel like that's a dying dream.
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,interstellars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"It's kinda sad that I can't display her front because she's looking back, but she's still beautiful and I hope to get her soon."

AnimeFigures,3d4byg,rakevinwr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:28 2015 UTC,I think I may actually like her like this better than with the armor.
AnimeFigures,3d4byg,konohasaiyajin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:48:17 2015 UTC,"Same I wouldn't mind if you can't attach it. I highly doubt it won't though.   She is going to look amazing next to my Tharja. I hope that we have Lucina figma by then but, the way things have been we might see this figure release before her."
AnimeFigures,3d6j4j,majoramiibo,2,Mon Jul 13 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"Sunlight is definitely bad as both head and UV light will do unfortunate things to your figures.  Tungsten and CFL bulbs are ok so long as they're outside of the case so that heat won't build up in the case but they both do emit a bit of UV light so over very long time horizons (much longer than direct sunlight) they have the potential fade your figures but, as long as you're not lighting them night and day with such sources, it's not something to be too worried about.    The best light source is LED lighting which does not emit appreciable heat or UV light.  Museums' adoption of LED lighting is probably the best endorsement you can get."
AnimeFigures,3d6j4j,Tsunami3k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:15 2015 UTC,I was thinking abiut lighting my detolf with dioders? Is that good?
AnimeFigures,3d6j4j,Kyuubi87,2,Mon Jul 13 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are using Dioder, myself included. The lights emitted from them isn't bad for the figures."
AnimeFigures,3d6j4j,Ten-kara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you! I will buy them~"
AnimeFigures,3d6j4j,Tsunami3k,2,Tue Jul 14 00:37:17 2015 UTC,"Just one thing regarding Ikea's Dioders. They changed them a while back so they are now a warm white light of 2700 Kelvin. They will give off a warm orange-ish colour. The parts you get in the set are easy to assemble and set up so if it's your first attempt at lighting and you don't mind the warm colour, grab the Dioders."
AnimeFigures,3d6j4j,Tsunami3k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, perfect for Detolfs."
AnimeFigures,3d66eg,abysszero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:54:09 2015 UTC,Nice figure!   Should post on /r/OneTrueUiharu/ also.
AnimeFigures,3d66eg,0mfgroflmao,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:28 2015 UTC,will do xD
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,alan2500,2,Mon Jul 13 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"For a good deal, it really depends on the item you're getting, so you have to watch for good opportunities.  If by undervalue you mean negotiate prices, you have to be in their stores to do that.   Their English site's automatic translator software sometimes gets confused, so doing a Japanese search can give more results (if you don't know japanese like me, just google search for the Japanese names and copy paste them into the search).    For shipping, each store mails out their own things and charges you shipping for what they have, so if you want to combine many figures for cheaper shipping, make sure they're all from the same store.  (Their search lets you narrow results down to one store for you to pick from)"
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,whut-whut,2,Tue Jul 14 00:14:32 2015 UTC,You can bargain in the physical stores??
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,Atheisticles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. Just like any other place that sells used/collector items, there is no -real- price. Value's between the buyer and seller. Your mileage varies of course, on who you deal with, how much you're buying, and how badly that manager wants to turn a stale item into money for the shop."
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,whut-whut,2,Tue Jul 14 15:38:29 2015 UTC,What a pity I can't speak Japanese to hard bargain.
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,Atheisticles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, by undervalue, i was thinking them writing a smaller value on the package, so that i do not have to pay the extra fees. I am gonna give the japanese search a shot."
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,InfinityRider,2,Tue Jul 14 12:15:13 2015 UTC,"You have to ask the to undervalue. Should be a comments box when you're placing an order, you do it there. Some stores will do it, some will not. I'm not sure which is which.  I'm not sure how the prices compare to Mandarake, but this place undervalues and is similar to Mandarake in the way it sells used/second hand items. http://jungle-scs.co.jp/sale_en/"
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,InfinityRider,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"Do you know what happens if they do not want to undervalue? Do they just cansel the order, or keep it and write the full amount on the package?"
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,felc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:33:00 2015 UTC,No idea. Haven't used them since they changed their undervalue policy. I'm assuming they won't cancel the order. You could ask them to cancel it if they won't undervalue it.
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,unpronounceableSA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:45:03 2015 UTC,"For the most part, yes they do. However, rarer figures are still up there in price, but for good reason. A lot of great deals obviously get snatched up quick, so it's a bit of timing and luck on your part. There is something called Store Front item, where you essentially place an order and then that particular store checks if they have it in stock. They are real stores operating their own store in Japan, so someone might have gone and bought it in person at store. Happens, but hope no one does. Then there is something called Spot Sale, meaning it's ready and available the moment you click order, so no need to worry about someone else buying. So far, I think only Sahra store does this, but I can't 100% confirm this.  There's a thing were they charge you a flat 500 yen fee if your TOTAL order is under 5000 yen, and no you can't combine with other stores unfortunately. So the best way I guess is to always try and meet that 5000 limit with each store you buy from to avoid the 500 yen fee, but that does lead to overspending (i.e buying extra figures you don't need to meet it), and it's really a lot of money commitment cause 5000 isn't little. Unless you absolutely need it right away, like super rare figure, for under 5000, better to let them sit in your cart and find items until 5000 minimum.  Mandrake is the absolute best when it comes to preowned, and I recommend a site called Playmoya if you are into more rarer figures. Playmoya is a bit expensive sometimes, but again, you could strike gold there. Other sites are around the same price if we disregard Mandarake, but second best is AmiAmi."
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,ricky_ortease,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:15:29 2015 UTC,"By undervaluing, i was thinking them putting in a smaller amount on the customs forms, sorry for not explaining, was not sure how to do it. I suppose that  500 yen fee gets added onto the shipping cost aswell? If i buy two figures to get above the 5000 yen, will they be in the same package when i get them? I am afraid that would make the chance of customs giving me fees higher."
AnimeFigures,3d6td0,Chiriesz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:28:52 2015 UTC,"When you're talking about undervaluing, are you talking about what they put on the customs forms?"

AnimeFigures,3d6td0,Rikiia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:17:29 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, you have to ask them specifically to undervalue your item. If you happen to get caught, they're not going to take responsibility."

AnimeFigures,3d550q,Avew,5,Mon Jul 13 16:33:24 2015 UTC,Nice! The world needs more shounen shelves @u@   I'm super jealous of your Hiei. I hope he doesn't go up in price too much before I find the spare cash to order him >.> Also: Kurama next please Alphamax :D
AnimeFigures,3d550q,TychoRC,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"Thx, and I agree shounen figures are not shown enough love! As a guy i find it sad that men (the main figure collection fanbase) enjoy girl figures more.   As for Hiei, honestly I dont think his price is gonna go up, so no pressure (dont think it sold 2 well). But its an AMAZING figure the quality is so great. Pictures will never do it justice it looks 100x better I.R.L.   Also really hoping Alphamax releases the other guys! I'm satisfied with this Kurama for now so I want Yusuke (actually I want them to re-release their old Yusuke vs Toguro - emailed them already)"
AnimeFigures,3d550q,TychoRC,3,Mon Jul 13 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"I can understand why though. I have very few male friends who's favorite characters are also male, and very few female ones who's are female. I myself never play as my own gender in games when given the option :T  Ah well, after a few years of collecting, I guess I just got used to never expecting figures of my favorite guys, and then just being pleasantly surprised when it happens, haha.  I've noticed that Hiei's still in stock just about everywhere... I wish I had PO'ed him on Amiami before they bumped up the price though! I have Koto's Kurama too, but I don't like that he's just standing there :/ I would love to have a more action orientated figure of him! I would be happy with Yusuke too though. You can't go wrong with the MC. Not that it matters probably. If Hiei didn't sell well, I doubt they'd continue the line >:"

AnimeFigures,3d550q,charly3p,3,Wed Jul 15 19:11:00 2015 UTC,I finally put up my first shelf and decided to fill it with my shounen figures. Still got plenty of more figures for this shelf and figures not related to shounen but running out of space. And the need for a new shelf/risers is becoming very apparent.   Anyhow enjoy the pics!   (this comment was suppose to be the description but I suck at reddit formatting so oh well haha)
AnimeFigures,3d33kr,Anime-Summit,17,Mon Jul 13 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"This is one of those things that only the people you know so well would be able to come up with.  The service ribbons give it a nice touch.  Feel proud of it, sir/ma'am and never forget those who gave it to you because they obviously love you."
AnimeFigures,3d33kr,ledgekindred,32,Mon Jul 13 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"So, I get out of the Marine Corps tomorrow after 6 years.  I had recently recieved a cryptic phone call asking me who my favourite sailor senshi was. I almost, in my sleepy daze, answered Sailor Venus, but I came to my sense and said Sailor Jupiter.  Not only does the plaque on the front face include no less than 6 different typefaces to annoy me, but the left side has PFC, LCPL, and CPL chevrons, the right side has my ribbon stack, and a Corporal challenge coin is affixed to the top.  Pretty awesome gift. More than I expected."

AnimeFigures,3d5zy0,randel_07,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"I've been using Dioder from IKEA. Probably not the ones you've been using, but they are really easy to handle/set up and the light these emit is a really comfortable and warm light :) Note: there are more forms of Dioder, which can change the light colour."
AnimeFigures,3d5zy0,randel_07,2,Mon Jul 13 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"I can't find the exact LED strip I bought anymore, but I bought just a 5m strip with a power adapter. It worked for me because I was comfortable cutting up the strips and wiring them, so I was able to create a customized solution for 2 of my cubes. Let me know if you have more questions and I'll try to help."
AnimeFigures,3d5zy0,randel_07,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:34:49 2015 UTC,I am starting to think I am going to have to do that as well since the pre cut one foot connectors are going to be a tad short.  Thank you for the reply.

AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,heyisjambo,2,Mon Jul 13 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"Yah... I'm pretty disappointed by them too. On top of what you mentioned, why jerseys? If they wanted to do alternate's why not the school uniforms?   Also: I just knew Oikawa would get sculpted before Yuu ;n;   The most painful part of the disappointment is that I'll still get them >.>"
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,TychoRC,2,Mon Jul 13 14:19:59 2015 UTC,"Haha, that is so spot on that the most painful part is that we'll still pay out the nose for them! I think I'll end up buying anything even remotely interesting that orange rouge puts out just because I want to support their decision to make more male figures, or as my fianc√©e put it ""I'm still gonna buy it because I'm fujoshi trash"""
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,heyisjambo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:51:20 2015 UTC,"Fellow fujoshi trash checking in! No shame here sir ma'am! I'm not sure why they thought they needed a special line for male figures (as opposed to just releasing them without a special title), but I do appreciate the idea of more men. Alter had the Altiar line for men, so hopefully this goes just as well <3"
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,TychoRC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:26:22 2015 UTC,If they come with super cute face plates and accessories.........I'm not sure I could resist.   Goddamnit GSC...

AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,TychoRC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"Oh my God they come with food. I saw some talk in the comments section on their MFC pages that they might be exclusive? If so, then even more suffering.     My other problem is that they're from Haikyuu. I can't resist Haikyuu -n-   You and me both. I'm so desperate at this point."
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,interstellars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"Yah, but hopefully they'll go up together, so we can save on shipping at least :/   What I think it strange is that these could have easily been Nendoroid Co-de's, but they decided to make them into completely separate figures. It's not really a complaint, but it is curious.  Side thought: Isn't this the first time that a male nendo got the alternate outfit treatment?"
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,TychoRC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"It'll probably be more expensive to buy them as nendos, which is why they probably did that. More $$$ for them. But, yeah, they could've. I mean unless the faceplates are SUPER different. Then maybe that would justify it.   I think it is? The only other series I could see having that done is Touken Ranbu with their relaxed outfits because, you know, they're so hot right now."
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,interstellars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:04:00 2015 UTC,"It is, but they also have to provide more variety, so it all evens out...mostly. I will admit that I'd really like to see some Nendoroid Co-de/Nendoroid More outfits for male nendo's, but if they want to make us entirely separate nendo's instead, I'm pretty alright with that too!   I hadn't heard about alternate outfits for the TR boys, but that makes sense I guess. I don't really keep up with the 7 million TR figures floating around. Mostly because I'm not into the fandom and I'm trying not to show my bitter jealousy that they're getting so many figures in such a small amount of time >:"
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,TychoRC,2,Mon Jul 13 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this is the beginning of a new trend and we'll get more male figure diversity, or you know, at least give us the same options the popular female nendos get.    Yeah they have relaxed outfits which they wear during certain events at the citadel. Or just track suits because why not. The only advice I can give you is to never play/get into Touken Ranbu or you will never leave. You'll be sucked into this black hole of bishounen sword boys."
AnimeFigures,3d4hkh,interstellars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:58:52 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see noya sculpted. I would settle for just finding Hinata at a lower price. I've been hunting him and the price is just getting higher.

AnimeFigures,3d5im3,grizzenbox,3,Mon Jul 13 18:09:43 2015 UTC,Had to send.... seven or eight emails possibly more before they responded back to me on canceling a pre-order on BIJ. I've never worked with any other site except Amiami and I'll keep working with AmiAmi since all packages have arrived in pristine condition and way before the shipping estimation.
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,DarthDiscord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:38:59 2015 UTC,Yup! I shop at amiami exclusively. Had experience with other places but didn't work out
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,chocokeroppi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that other sites have better point systems, and that Amiami may over pack their packages. But hey, AmiAmi has never given me a problem, they've always responded to emails quickly and every package I've bought as come in pristine condition."
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,DarthDiscord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't had an issue with ""over packing"" Its pretty good for my case but great customer service"
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,chocokeroppi,2,Tue Jul 14 00:04:07 2015 UTC,I've never had a problem with BIJ in the past however one thing they're notorious at is their very slow customer service. Just keep bugging them and they should reply eventually.
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,Rikiia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"My god I had the exact same issue with BIJ.  They took my preorder money and I never received a package.  They sent me one email and told me to wait 3 months because sometimes SAL took a while to ship.  That was conveniently the time limit to file a Paypal complaint.  All of my emails went unanswered after that so they basically scammed me out of my money.  When I posted about it people were all like ""maybe it's true but I've never had a problem with BIJ"".  They are a shady company and I would never recommend anyone order from them."
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,LulusPanties,3,Mon Jul 13 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"Another reason why I'd never want to use SAL, always EMS with tracking + insurance."
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,Kyuubi87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:13:48 2015 UTC,Any good retailer would make sure the customer did not pay money for nothing.  Any decent retailer would make sure the customer wasn't outright ignored.
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,LulusPanties,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"I know retailers recommend shipping options due to insurance and tracking. If I recall SAL doesn't come with either unless it is registered? In that case it is a risk at your end for purchasing and choosing the shipping since the company in that case isn't liable for a parcel getting lost on the way. That's what I get out of it at least, in terms of information. You also have to remember that some customers try to scam retailers by claiming they never got the parcel - I'm not implying you are doing that, but the retailer also needs to be protected in that regard."
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,Kyuubi87,0,Tue Jul 14 21:41:17 2015 UTC,They contacted me saying that SAL did admit the package was lost in transit.  I purchased SAL insured for 6000 yen.  They said they would get back to me and refund me 6k yen even though the figure cost 11k.  All further emails from them were ignored.  I didn't even get my 6k refund  BIJ are shady.  Why does nobody believe me?  I mean if you get screwed over by them it's your loss.
AnimeFigures,3d5im3,LulusPanties,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:13:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the replies. I do stick to amiami for 99% of my preorders other than that I have been using Nippon Yasan for what doesn't come up on amiami. Really hope they come through as the price aftermarket is now on the rise. Even if they do I'm definitely done with them.

Fixing paint is not easy. It is very hard to match the color let alone metallic/chrome/clear paint....

AnimeFigures,3d31kw,chocokeroppi,3,Mon Jul 13 03:50:29 2015 UTC,"good god i wish shipping wasnt so expensive, but ill take the hit since it looks so cute"
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,skip2mylou000,3,Mon Jul 13 04:08:39 2015 UTC,I still don't get this one. At 2k shipping is cheap for me. It's EMS and I'm getting 3 figures shipped + more if I wanted to order anything else from their store. $55 is roughly what a nendo cost in the states before shipping from the store. I know most nendos are discounted through Amiami and such but its still a great deal IMO.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,chocokeroppi,2,Mon Jul 13 13:38:07 2015 UTC,It's about $46 for the figure and $22 for shipping for us Australians. A cool $68 AUD :S Getting really bad exchange rates at the moment...  This is generally what we pay in local stores though I suppose.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Ten-kara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:34:00 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the way it work here too pretty much. I usually try to order more to make it up. That's just me though.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,chocokeroppi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:07 2015 UTC,im fine with waiting a few weeks to get it shipped though is the thing and this is the only thing im ordering from the store
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,skip2mylou000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:22 2015 UTC,But wouldn't the savings be minimal at this point? Cause SAL would be like $5 cheaper maybe? Not sure how SAL works now but I did twice and never again. I'm glad it works for you though :D   You should definitely find a group on your community to get the most savings since u can order 3.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,chocokeroppi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:21:30 2015 UTC,How much is the shipping? I've never ordered from them.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,reynaden,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:01:42 2015 UTC,It was an extra 2000yen which is 15$ usd? Kicked the total from 35$ to about 55$
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,skip2mylou000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:27:40 2015 UTC,"But because it is so cute, you want it ASAP.  It is shipped EMS so it is very fast.  I find it almost worth the price."
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Caylm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:06:04 2015 UTC,yes it is very cute which i like but at the same time im willing to wait a few weeks to receive it to get a lower shipping cost
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,skip2mylou000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:37:26 2015 UTC,Yeah this is too nice to pass up. Ordered!  So far this is the only thing I have ordered for December so my wallet should be fine.   EDIT: hahahaha ... This is actually released in November lol. Thats gonna be a rough month for money haha

AnimeFigures,3d31kw,mickeydeerho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:05:14 2015 UTC,"Haven't ordered from GSC store before so just have one question if anyone can answer it for me. If I order this Miku, will I be able to combine the order with other items I order later this month so that they can be shipped together? Or will this Nendoroid ship by itself, and any order I make later will be shipped separately to this one? Thanks."
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Ten-kara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:41:59 2015 UTC,"No. You can combine orders if you order the things at the same time and have of course the same release date. Otherwise, they will send different packages. Goodsmile company shop is good for big orders. Right now I was expecting miku to show up for preorder to buy other 4 figures with her, it saves you many shipping fees. :)"
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,basketballfan14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:32:10 2015 UTC,So I have to order it all at the same time? I want to combine this Miku with the Mako that's coming up for PO on the 26th. So that means I should wait until then and order both together.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Ten-kara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you can't combine GoodSmileCompany orders with Wonderful Hobby Life For You ones. So, in your case you must buy them separate as they're technically different shops. Combining orders is applicable, only when buying at the same time and from the same store."
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,basketballfan14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:50:37 2015 UTC,I believe you have to pay separate shipping for those. Now if you make the order at the same time you can combine. So if it is the mako nendo that you're after you would have to hold back on placing your order until those pre-orders open. I personally don't like to risk it and prefer paying the shipping. But I will send an e-mail to customer support and see what happens. I once ordered multiple items that shipped different months and I only got charged for one shipping.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,chocokeroppi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"I know if you place the order together and the items happen to have to ship at different times they cover the shipping cost for you.   Just looked at what /u/basketballfan14 said so I checked Mako's store page and found this notice * Though WONDERFUL HOBBY LIFE FOR YOU!! 22 products can be grouped together in a single order, they cannot be combined with any other products.  Please take note when placing your order  So I guess I will order the Miku now if I decide to get her as they won't be able to combine her and Mako anyway. Thanks for your help guys."
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Ten-kara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:00:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I ordered my miku and will order mako later. To make it worth I feel that I have to order more than one xD
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,chocokeroppi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"I got the Tsurumaru Nendoroid as well as the Miku just because I wanted to order something else to make use of the flat shipping... haha. Well my Kogitsunemaru will have a friend now. I didn't even know about Ranbu until the Nendoroids came out. GSC flat shipping pressures you into buying more... confirmed. Sneaky, so sneaky."
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Ten-kara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:43:46 2015 UTC,yup! confirmed.

AnimeFigures,3d31kw,gpia7r,4,Mon Jul 13 12:43:14 2015 UTC,She's not an anime character. She's a vocaloid. She is basically a -voice synthesizing programme.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,basketballfan14,2,Mon Jul 13 13:51:24 2015 UTC,See?  That's how little I know of her.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,gpia7r,3,Mon Jul 13 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"Haha, I don't know anyone who is in this hobby that doesn't know about Miku to be honest. Since alot of the popular figures are of her."
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,420istheanswer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:33:13 2015 UTC,I keep going back and forth with her. She is a gorgeous nendoroid but I'm not a die-hard Miku fan. Plus the release is in the same month as a nendoroid I pre ordered from amiami... that's double shipping costs. Hmmmmmmm....
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,MiyuuCupcake,2,Mon Jul 13 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"I was the same as you, but then I decided to go ahead and grab her. I'm thinking it'll be easier to give my PO away if I change my mind then try to grab someone else's.  Plus, I can think of a lot of other nendos that could use that cute dress if I just don't feel like displaying another Miku :D"

AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Ten-kara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:29:08 2015 UTC,I have a question. Why buy more than 1? To sell later? Do the prices on these inflate? Is it worth it to buy more than one?
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,helloitsumi,2,Mon Jul 13 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"You can expect the price to jump 50-100% depending on the popularity of the exclusive. Notice how some of the racing Mikus are significantly higher asking prices as their initial values - and that's even with successive iterations coming out on a yearly basis. Also, if you figure that shipping never increases with the GSC shop, buying more and selling the others will at least save you shipping costs (if you sell at cost)."
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,arcangelxvi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:34:44 2015 UTC,This kinds of exclusives tend to inflate over time also some people like to keep one unopened.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,akumamaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:26:56 2015 UTC,Since I've never ordered from GSC before if I want to pay for the figures with PayPal will I be charged now or when it is released? I know with amiami I'm not charged until the figure comes out.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,fry133,2,Mon Jul 13 21:13:55 2015 UTC,you can probably get her on amiami too (it is cheaper) and gsc doesn't charge until release.
AnimeFigures,3d31kw,Utasora,2,Mon Jul 13 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"This Miku is GSC exclusive, so AmiAmi won't sell her. Also they will charge you around 2 weeks before she ships out"

AnimeFigures,3d1nvr,mtins,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"There are NO WORDS for how frustrating it is to get her in her flying pose. Like, none. I broke my thumb nail in the process. The way her extra bottom fits onto the torso is super loose and it does not like to stay haha. I took so many pictures of her in that pose just because I knew I would probably never get her to stay like that. The wand itself doesn't like to stay attached to the skirt either and if you move the hand too close it knocks the wand loose. It's hard to see in the pictures because of how I took them, but the bottom is sorta wedged on there, so there's a gap on her back. If you're looking for it in the pictures, it's pretty noticeable tho haha. Also I love that Tomoyo's items include an extra black ring for the hat so that it will fit on Sakura's head. I was hoping I could have Tomoyo wear Sakura's hat, but it's too big for her head. So sad."
AnimeFigures,3d1nvr,mtins,2,Sun Jul 12 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried it with mine, gave up (stupid clumsy fingers!) and went with her 'Take THAT!' pose instead (after losing the card down the back of the couch and having to go on a quest to get it back!)

AnimeFigures,3d1nvr,Tsukuruya,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"Getting the beak switched over to the one for that pose took me a good half an hour.

So now if she wants to have the card on the beak, so be it. But that hole will be there forever."

AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,sparkletealfuzzypaws,9,Mon Jul 13 02:21:14 2015 UTC,Do they look dusty? Then go dust them.
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,shazwald,3,Mon Jul 13 02:54:58 2015 UTC,"It depends. I know some people who don't need to dust but once a month, while I personally dust twice a week. Albeit I dust that often because I live in the desert, and I don't like any dust whatsoever.  But assuming you don't get dust very often, I would probably do it once every 2 weeks. But again, that's because I hate seeing dust of any kind."
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,Carnyan,2,Mon Jul 13 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Not OP but follow-up question - what can dust do to your PVC figs?  Because I have mine on open shelves (one day I may own Detolfs...) and they collect dust.  I use a feather duster to wipe them off every month or so, but what if I didn't?  From what I know of SCIENCE, there's not a lot plain old dust is going to do to PVC outside of making it dusty."
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,ledgekindred,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:34:03 2015 UTC,Dust just makes them not look clean and most people don't like that.
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,shazwald,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:48:39 2015 UTC,"Dust can also trap moisture and other airborne particles against the figure.  This won't do much in the short term, but long term it can damage and dull the paint."
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,CyberbladeWolf,2,Mon Jul 13 18:39:40 2015 UTC,Figures are made out of plastic. Whether they're pristine or covered in a foot of dust particles there's no difference. Even the act of blowing compressed air shouldn't do anything. Don't think through this too much and dust when YOU think they're detracting from it's visual appeal.
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,gnauhZ,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there's a specific recommendation, but I can tell you what I've done.  I usually do a quick dusting once or twice a year (before my cats, once, after cats, twice) and one really thorough dusting once a year. Some of my figures are 10 to 15 years old and I think they look fine."
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,jedikuonji,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"Once a month sounds good but really it depends on the conditions of your room/where you live. Dust when you feel they need it. There really isn't a requirement to how often you should. It's more of a personal choice. As for Detolfs, you can install weather seals on the gaps to make dusting less frequent if you so desire."
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,Ten-kara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:47:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, Looking to pick a Detolf here soon, have 15+ figures at the moment, and keep usually just one on display and have the others stored in their box. I've read about the dangers of using compressed air on figures, most people have complained about the chemicals in the air causing discoloration to the figures over time, so do your research on that and be wary. Usually, I just use an a soft cloth to dust. a little water on the towel wont hurt at all. Cotton swabs for more detailed dusting. But, one thing I've learned, ALWAYS dust figures before placing them back in their box. Dust has a tendency to actually stick to figures, and can be more of a pain  getting it off once that's happened. Basically, cleaning up several small messes is better that one large mess. The time you put into their maintenance and upkeep will show."
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,astraldickweed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:18:40 2015 UTC,"I dust about once a month - if I have a new figure coming I time it ish, with the monthly dusting and go through everything before the new one arrives."
AnimeFigures,3d2vzp,Kyuubi87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:37:53 2015 UTC,"If the moisture is controlled you can probably get away just dusting when you think it looks off, but given the pets you may have other issues than dust to keep in mind such as hair or dog slobber (grew up with a St Bernard myself, I know dogs can get slobber everywhere workout trying, even places that make no sense lol)  I'd be careful about the hair.  Who knows what your pets have been rolling in that might be carried with the hair, and how that will react with paint over the long term.  If you have a lot of figures, I'd suggest dusting in groups.  One day do one shelf, the next another, and so on.  That way it doesn't feel like it takes forever, even if you don't do it frequently."

AnimeFigures,3d2ecd,Asarath,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"Shit. That's an interesting way to weed out some figures that we as consumers only want, making us choose the one that we truly need. You have peaked my interest, and I commend you for that.  As hard of a decision as it is, I'd probably say that for my choice it'd have to be Alter's 1/8 Yoko Littner Bounty Hunter Edition. I just have an overall fondness with this given figure, and I desperately want it in my collection. Yet, the figure itself is almost too rare, and quite expensive for what I'm really willing to pay. Yet, I might cave, one of these days to that beauty.  Now, I'd like to hear your input on what would be your last figure ever?

AnimeFigures,3d2ecd,fry133,2,Mon Jul 13 01:14:47 2015 UTC,Can't really answer that. There isn't one figure that really stands out to me to be one and only figure. I do see why people would want GSC's Ultimate Madoka. I don't even know anything about the show but the figure stands out and looks amazing.
AnimeFigures,3d2ecd,meib,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:26:46 2015 UTC,"Right on, it is a tough question, but Madoka Magica being my favorite show, makes it an easy choice for me"

AnimeFigures,3d2ecd,Anime-Summit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:12 2015 UTC,"You ever look at the bottom of figure boxes and look at run numbers? I didnt for a while, and just thought there were infinite numbers of whatever. If its not obscured by other stickers, should be right on the bottom or back, depending where the labeling is. Ex. 297/6000 (Figure number/Number produced)   Where a figure was released or sold as well, can affect the price. Conventions are often popular hosting venues for the first sales of a figure from whenever it leaves the producer.   (insert figure name here) 1/7th scale first release Wonderfest Exclusive  Helps to put some things into perspective as to price jumps/falls and stuff as time goes on."
AnimeFigures,3d2ecd,astraldickweed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:22:18 2015 UTC,Just seems wierd that that one is such a huge difference.  Ultimate Madoka is over $200 but it released at over $100.
AnimeFigures,3d2ecd,Anime-Summit,2,Mon Jul 13 04:27:43 2015 UTC,For me it would be the Tsugumi Nendoroid which I'm glad I own! How someone bundled up so much cuteness and attitude into 3 faces and a small little body is beyond me.

AnimeFigures,3d2ecd,BrownSugarSandwich,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"If I could only have one figure, I think it would need to meet a few criteria for me. The first couple being the obvious: it has to be of a character I like, from a show that has significant and lasting value to me, and it has to have a nice sculpt and paint job. The criteria that really shouldn't be underestimated, in my opinion, is that it should be poseable. If you are only getting one figure forever, then you better either REALLY love its pose, or you should be able to change up its pose, so you can get some extra mileage out of it. Now that said, I generally actually don't like poseable figures (I think figma joints are usually wonky, and dolls aren't my thing), but the exception are for things that should be jointed... like robots.    Which brings me to my choice, the Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann Riobot. I may have a little recency bias here since I just got mine in a few days ago, but it is really just as good as I'd imagined during my several month-long hunt for it. It looks amazing, it is super flexible, and it comes with a ton of awesome accessories. Really the only cons I can think of for this figure are that it could stand to be a bit bigger, and it would be cool if I came with a giant, fat drill instead of the long, skinny one, but that's just a personal thing.    My honorable mentions would go to the Alphonse Elric Real Action Heroes, and if I were to give a non-poseable alternative, my choice would be the Aniplex timeshift Homura"

You'll find tinier, simpler ones like:  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/98678  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/99636  Keep in mind that site only lists release prices, so with a collector's market, older items have generally gone up in price when you search for actual sellers."

AnimeFigures,3d1bwr,whut-whut,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"No actually it's 2300 JPY for the first item (because you can't order anything alone, so it's not the 700 base fee per shipment), and then 1600 for every additional KG. So you can have 5 small items that don't add up to 1KG and still have a 2300 JPY shipping fee.   Now, I'm not 100% sure on this because I ordered through them multiple times before this new shipping fee, but assuming they are as straight forward as the chart, it should be how it is. However, since you recently ordered something, you might have a better idea. How many items did you order? What type were they? How much did they charge you for shipping? And how much was the weight of the package?"

You can use it search by character or show/game to find the brand of a dream figure you want to help narrow down your searches of your dream figure online.  Knowing the brand of figure helps shorten the search in sifting through less-ideal figures of what you want.  mandarake.co.jp is the largest used anime figure seller in japan. Their search function shows what they have in stock in each of their stores throughout japan.  Everything from them is strictly appraised, so you won't get any fakes from them.  They're also constantly buying up used anime merch, so their in-stock database is updated every 12 hours.  If you can't find it from them, then chances are it's going to be very, very rare.  amazon.co.jp is also worth a shot.  It's account system is separate from regular amazon.com, so you have to register a new account there to buy.  But like ebay and other flea-market type sites, be careful with possible fakes. use the bootleg megathread in this sub to get expert help on judging if a seller/item is good or not."

AnimeFigures,3cyexd,Norberces,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:23:14 2015 UTC,"I went ahead and split up the albums this time around or else the album in the post would have been gigantic. I've included more detailed albums with each link below.   Annabel was a pick up from Mandarake early into this month and Daisy  was a pick up from a seller here a couple of weeks back. These two are my first 1/6 scales and they are just as stunning as they are enormous. While Kotobukiya can be somewhat hit or miss I think both Annabel and Daisy can stand up to any of my Alter or Max Factory figures in terms of quality. My one complaint with them is that their bases aren't really all that great unless you do what I did and spice them up a bit with artificial flowers after inverting the base. Shinobu  was one of my two pre orders that came in. I never really thought that Kotobukiya's Shinobu or GSC's face really fit her character all that well but after I saw the more mischievous look for the alternate face on Alter's I had to have it. She's in line with Alter's quality level as usual and I have no complaints other than her accessories fitting kind of loosely. I can't wait to have Kiss-shot join her late this year. Maki  was my other pre order that came in. I think I've reached the point of no return on the slipper slope of Love Live figures. With Maki here I'm probably going to end up pre-ordering at least one of each of the rest of the cast as long as one of the major companies is producing them. Maki looks kind of odd being a 1/7 scale next to 1/8 but I'm glad that her outfit fits with the others and the paint job on her is gorgeous. Luka  was a pick up from a seller here. To be honest Luka was an impulse buy to make my Vocaloid shelf a bit less of a Miku shrine. She's of the qaulity level I would expect from GSC and I think they did a particularly good job with the translucence of her hair. For the price I got her for I'm more than happy to have her to diversify my Vocaloid shelf. Mikuzukin was also a pick up from a sale here. As expected of Max Factory the details on her are astounding. Every bit of lace is perfectly sculpted and the paint isn't off by a millimeter. I was somewhat hesitant to get her as the pictures on MFC make her face look kind of odd but I found that it is a lot less pronounced in person. With her the Miku shrine grows. Moral of this post is, please stop posting sales my wallet can't handle it."

AnimeFigures,3cwj20,Toranyan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:17:10 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Alter is one of the best (if not THE best) figure making company out there.  Maki looks good, as I expected! But I don't think they will be making the other girls in their swimsuits.. ): Anyway, nice pics! Hope you like her!"

AnimeFigures,3cwj20,days_distance,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:40:39 2015 UTC,Alter takes a long time to deliver figures.   Alter's upcoming 1/7 Rin and 1/7 Kotori are in completely different costume themes. They also announced a completely new line for their Halloween costume ver. (Which prototypes hasn't even been released yet) So that's why I think they won't be making any more LL swimsuit girls.
AnimeFigures,3cwj20,420istheanswer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:37:39 2015 UTC,Makes sense. One can dream! T-T
AnimeFigures,3cwj20,days_distance,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:11 2015 UTC,I love the detail of her beaded necklace and bracelet! I also love how she has the same kind of base as the Free! boys... I feel like I should get her and throw her in with them so they can have a little swimwear party!
AnimeFigures,3cwj20,klipson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:48:36 2015 UTC,mine just arrived today! I really like the detail they put to the stand! The water droplets on the stand look really good imo!
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,martijn208,2,Sat Jul 11 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"Semi related, at my work we get used computers in all the time that are smokey for refurbishing. The only thing we can do is let them run and air out. If you have a portable fan just aim it at the figure and let it air out for a while. As long as possible really around 3-4 weeks if possible."
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,traxions,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"thats a long time, i did it only for a day din't smell anything for a while but later it was back"
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,traxions,2,Sat Jul 11 18:57:34 2015 UTC,The smell probably saturated into the plastic so it would just take time for it to get out.   Maybe try one of these? : http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/cigarette-smell-out-toys-34534.html
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,Chiriesz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:41:25 2015 UTC,Put it down inside a bag of clean kitty litter for like 1-2 days.
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,Chiriesz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:08:59 2015 UTC,wont it get dirty that way? and do you think clay kitty litter is a good idea?
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,RoninUnderground,3,Sat Jul 11 19:12:02 2015 UTC,I bought a used doll on Mandarake that arrived smelling like cigarettes.  I wrapped her in a paper towel and put her inside a big bag of kitty litter and the smell was gone after a few days.  Probably best to wrap it in a pillow case or something so the paint isn't scratched by the litter.
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,Hekarti,2,Sat Jul 11 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"Cat litter has a lot of dust in it, even if it solved the smell issue it will cause other problems."
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,materix01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"I have seen some people placing a bowl of ground coffee to get the cigarette smell out of old cars, so you can try placing that and the figure in a box for a few days."
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,Hekarti,2,Sat Jul 11 21:48:21 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the figure just smell like ground coffee???
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,CyberbladeWolf,3,Sun Jul 12 05:01:50 2015 UTC,I would say coffee smell is definitely better than cigarette smell.
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,materix01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:37:29 2015 UTC,"Newspaper is often used for removing some odors, could try sealing the figure in a plastic storage bin with some crumpled up newspaper and see what happens.  That's the only option I can come up with that's not already been said."
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,RoninUnderground,0,Tue Jul 14 13:12:13 2015 UTC,Just air it out. Some of the smell removing enzyme sprays can help as well. Or mask it with a more pleasant smell like perfume.
AnimeFigures,3cxd6h,Hynil,-13,Sun Jul 12 05:02:42 2015 UTC,...do I want to know why you're smelling your figures?
AnimeFigures,3cxkmi,Russiandragon55,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"It's an event exclusive, which means she'll only be for sale there. If you're desperate for it, you might be able to find one in the aftermarket, but it'll most likely be expensive/difficult to find/both."
AnimeFigures,3cxkmi,klipson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:32:16 2015 UTC,I know that it is exclusive but haven't exclusive figures gone on sale online as well? If you are right and after market is my last hope do I go to Mandarake? Thank you!
AnimeFigures,3cxkmi,klipson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"At the moment the only announcements are saying that it's an event exclusive - usually, they'd have said if they planned to sell them online afterwards (for example, the Autumn Miku). So while it might happen, it's not a good sign that it hasn't been announced yet...   And yeah, Manda is a good idea, or Amiami preowned, or Yahoo! Auctions JP. Or someone might be selling through MFC. Basically, keep your eyes peeled!"

AnimeFigures,3cxbk9,Hynil,2,Mon Jul 13 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"figma was bought new and on display only for a few weeks. It's not a favorite of mine, tbh. It's received reviews for being kinda loose. Parts, like the front hair piece, have a tendency to slip off and such.   I'll edit this comment with the poster dimensions when I get home from work, but it is quite large and as mentioned, it's a vinyl poster."

Griffon has horrible quality control, and their end product looks like shit compared to the advertised picture. Some of their figures end up looking decent. Some. Few. But they dish out a lot of shitty figures with deceptive promotional pictures so often that you simply don't want to support a company like that."

AnimeFigures,3cwkum,420istheanswer,2,Sat Jul 11 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"Another fair critique of them is ""Griffon-face""; while lots of their sculptures are nice, they often have rather samey faces and this is especially true for the Touhou lineup.  I have quite a few Touhou figures and most are from Griffon largely because they're cheap.  None are terrible, in fact the poses are often quite nice, but the finish quality is sometimes lacking when scrutinizing them up close.  (A great example is Tatara who has a playful pose, rich colors and a nice sculpt but the cutout for her umbrella's mouth is tragically jagged.)Eg.   http://plastiqpixel.smugmug.com/Figures/Touhou-Project/Tatara-Kogasa-Griffon/i-nnx3MJZ/A  tldr; If you can get one with solid reviews for a good price, then you'll likely get a good value for what you pay for.  If you want to play it safe[r], companies like Ques Q or Phat have made some great Touhou figures as well but be aware that they're usually significantly more expensive."

About equal in price to what I've seen on mandrake but I rarely check there and have never made a purchase through them. (They were both on there a few days ago for 4000 and 8000 yen respectively though.)

AnimeFigures,3cx7l4,KingPingus,8,Sat Jul 11 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"I have several comments:   It doesn't feel like a database in the same way that MFC does. It feels like a place to post pictures of figures in a very informal way, along with comments. It also doesn't give the information I often want from MFC, such as price.2 where to preorder, manufacturer, etc.  MFC already lets you sort figures by most wished/most ordered etc, so how would your crowdscore add more value than this? MFC is already well used and relies on volunteer users to keep their databases up to date - how will you do the same? Who would physically arrange for the figure trading to happen? Would it add additional cost onto selling figures? Do they have enough space to make this happen? How do we know theyre legit? And how does it add anymore security than PayPal buyer protection? Would users be able to post their own sales to the store front or is it handled centrally? What exactly is the 'good backing' you have? And exactly what innovation do you think they would provide that isn't currently being met by MFC? At the moment youe promises of future innovation feel a bit pie in the sky."
AnimeFigures,3cx7l4,klipson,0,Sat Jul 11 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"Very good questions thank you for making me think about these!   Gemr is not aimed at becoming a database in the same way that MFC does. We want to create an area where you can easily and informally discuss figures and whatever you collect. Each item will have extremely in depth information about the figure in the story section. This information will include price, manufacturer, etc.   In the club we already have numerous Gundams and figures that are custom figures. This is where crowd scoring will come in handy because there is no price on these self made figures.   Gemr uses a system of curators. We hire people for each ""niche"" to curate and update the club full time. We hope that having paid professionals whose only job is to update the club will provide the same information that MFC's volunteers does.   There will be different tiers of trading security in the future. You will have the basic unprotected trading which wont be monitored by Gemr. Then there is basic protection where users are screened before trading, we will look at how long the account has been active, how active it is, the number of figures, etc. If we deem that the person does not have the credentials to trade they will not be allowed to. The highest tier of trading will be where both parties send their items to Gemr, we take pictures of both figures involved, send these back to each party, and if the figures are in the proper condition we will send the packages to their final destination. There would be an additional cost for the higher protection tier because of shipping. We hope that this would add much more security than paypal.   users will be able to post their own sales, wanted, trades, etc. But to own an actual storefront will cost them a monthly fee.   We have quite a few investors and are currently in negotiations with venture capital firms. As for innovations, we are honestly just looking for users feedback. We want people to use the site and then tell us what they think would find the most useful from the features that we are looking at. We promise that we take user feedback extremely seriously and try to put it into action as soon as possible.   I hope these answer some of your questions! Feel free to follow up with more questions."
AnimeFigures,3cx7l4,unpronounceableSA,3,Sat Jul 11 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"Gemr uses a system of curators. We hire people for each ""niche"" to curate and update the club full time. We hope that having paid professionals whose only job is to update the club will provide the same information that MFC's volunteers does.   You're planning on paying people to duplicate what is largely already compiled on MFC?   There will be different tiers of trading security in the future. You will have the basic unprotected trading which wont be monitored by Gemr. Then there is basic protection where users are screened before trading, we will look at how long the account has been active, how active it is, the number of figures, etc. If we deem that the person does not have the credentials to trade they will not be allowed to.    If I'm reading this correctly, you expect people to pay for you to do some basic background checking that is basic standard practice when buying from someone on a site?     The highest tier of trading will be where both parties send their items to Gemr, we take pictures of both figures involved, send these back to each party, and if the figures are in the proper condition we will send the packages to their final destination. There would be an additional cost for the higher protection tier because of shipping. We hope that this would add much more security than paypal.   Do you really expect people to pay more than twice the shipping, sending their figures to an as of yet unproven third party, risking additional customs problems for said third party to take pictures?  How much do you expect to charge to make up for when the figures aren't in satisfactory condition, and you have to ship them back?  What will you do if the figures get lost in the postal system from your company to their destination?  Also, why are you only talking about trading protections?  Is selling figures not something that warrants your ""extra protection""?  If you're providing similar protections for selling figures, what is the sequence of events regarding payments and shipping for the highest protection equivalent, where the figure gets sent to you?"
AnimeFigures,3cx7l4,KazeHD,0,Sat Jul 11 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"Yes curators will be paid!   The basic background check will not be a service that people pay for, it will simply be done. The only measure of security that will be paid for will be the highest one  For the highest tier we really do not expect that many people to use it, it is simply there for people who are extremely hesitant to trade or are trading extremely valuable figures. The risk of a package being lost in shipping is a basic fact of trading. That is not something that we can really account for.   Selling figures of course will have protections attached to them. I only focused on the trading features because I misred the first question."
AnimeFigures,3cx7l4,Kyuubi87,2,Sat Jul 11 21:09:35 2015 UTC,"Hey Ill give you some feedback/critique as well since I have been thinking about a similar service as well lately but I would probably never start something like that.  Design:   First thing that really pops out is the fact that the website looks more like a mobile website, is this a design choice? The site is fairly difficult to navigate and the links are leading you to different parts of the website that you ""maybe"" dont even want to visit. For example if I click on a figure there is no clear way to get back to the overview again without having to click return in the browser. There is a lot of wasted space with the gigantic ""join the club"" banner and other gigantic banners. Have you thought about what happens if the site takes off and you have lets say, 100 maybe 1000 figures posted on the website? How will you be able to browse this website easily when you are looking for X specific figure?   Selling/Buying:   The only questions and concern I have is for your ""highest tier"" service. Where will you store this? How can you prove that you are legit? What happens if you get 100+ figures? Who will pay for this service?     I think you need to rework/redesign the website and your system first before launching it. I didnt list things what others said (no database like structure etc) but you should know what people would like to see.  Like I said this is what I was thinking about so feel free to maybe try this path or ignore it:  I would have created a website where people could send in and sell their figures for credits and buy/bid on merch and other figures that have been sold that way. There would also be other ways to gain credits (raffle, events, contests like best nendo photoshoot) and users could trade or even gift their credits with other users.  Obviously this is not a system that makes any real profit so there is that."
AnimeFigures,3cx7l4,Ten-kara,2,Sat Jul 11 22:07:31 2015 UTC,I dunno.. MFC seems way easier and it's already established. What would your 'club' provide that MFC does not? Even retailers and manufacturers go on MFC to communicate with their customers.

AnimeFigures,3cuuct,SRFidy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:59 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell what happened. But if it snapped off, you'll need super glue and a metal wire and something like a small pin vise to drill a hole to hold the wire in."
AnimeFigures,3cuuct,materix01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"quick and dirty solution might be to super glue it (to various effect, i'm more versed in gundam models than pvc figurines, though I have heard some glue might melt the plastic as part of its binding process). The super glue you used on another figure previously might not have been specially for plastics, or the pvc surface was just too smooth for the glue to find a grip.  Another solution is to use some epoxy glue, depending on the brand/type of epoxy used, you have a few mins to make adjustments until it sets permanently, so there's that. Also, there are a few modeling cements that could work.  The piece doesn't look to be too big or heavy, so some gluing method would probably work. If not, it gets really tricky and you're gonna have to find a way to insert a wireframe to hold/reattach the piece back on."
AnimeFigures,3cuuct,axon_resonance,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:44:26 2015 UTC,One of the cautionary steps when using plastic glue is that one must control the volume applied as these glue has a tendency to run paint if too much is applied when one presses the two parts together.   I use them sometimes for my painted Gunpla and figures.
AnimeFigures,3cuuct,Blusttoy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:53:31 2015 UTC,"Don't know what happened to you last time, but super glue should fix this one without any problem."
AnimeFigures,3cuuct,rainbow_stars,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:37:44 2015 UTC,"I've repaired quite a few figures at this point and my go-to is 5-minute two-part epoxy.  Whereas some glues react with paint, PVC, ABS, resin, etc. and turn into a goo that never cures, I have yet to find anything that epoxy reacts poorly with.  It's very viscous and rarely goes beyond where you've applied it (unless you apply too much and/or squeeze it out when pushing together two joints) and is easily squeegeed off with a finger.  If it's a highly visible joint and you're using clear epoxy then I've found that it mixes well with small amounts of artisan inks you can find in most hobby stores to match the color of what you're gluing.  Best of all you've got 5-minutes to get everything perfect.  Contrast this with superglue which, in my experience anyway, is best for permanently attaching broken parts to myself, figures to myself, myself to myself, etc. and the extremely runny nature of the non-gel variants often broadens the damage beyond what you're trying to fix.  For most things (like Chopper's arms that I'm fixing today in fact) I tend to pin which is a whole mini-process unto itself but if I'm making out your blurrycam pic correctly, it looks like you're attaching the flat side of the broken piece to your figure so I'd just go the epoxy route.  A little light sanding to help the glue ""bite"" alittle better is never a bad idea but, if the patchwork of original paint and glue give you a nice means of fitting the part exactly then minimizing or omitting this step is ok.  Cheers and good luck!"
AnimeFigures,3cuuct,Tsunami3k,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies everyone, turns out while it did snap off, the piece stays in alright by itself. A slight bump will knock it out again, but that shouldn't be a problem considering its in a display case. If a more permanent solution becomes needed, I'll def look into the epoxy solution."

If you preordered late, you'll probably get one of the later production batches.  (Figure preorders open and close up to the release date as the manufacturer secures more production waves, once they know how many buyers there are.  First 1000 orders = First 1000 made, etc., sometimes you have to wait a while after launch date if you preordered a really popular figure late.)

IMO Rather than using the eraser on the layer with the lower opacity, I find making selections with quick mask is more efficient.  You can specify a color (I use neon green) to stand out when selecting and rather than having to delete it you can just make a new layer via cut and just hide it for later. For small things like a nendo stand it doesn't really make a difference but when you're editing around hair (figurine/real life) its the way to go.

AnimeFigures,3cr3hm,Atheisticles,0,Sat Jul 11 06:05:58 2015 UTC,Very informative!  If it was me tho...I'd just drop Mako till I get the perfect shot :(
AnimeFigures,3cqjxa,ac410,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:46:02 2015 UTC,Very nice gallery.  I liked how you had facts to highlight the focus of each photo.
AnimeFigures,3cqjxa,whut-whut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I hope the facts were not too daunting for those unfamiliar with Kantai Collection and or ww2 history. Because now I realize I never made an explanation on ""what this figure is supposed to be""."
AnimeFigures,3cqjxa,VanillaTortilla,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:11:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome! The facts were a great addition to the pictures. You should add in a picture of the actual Yamato, so people can see the facts that you mention."

AnimeFigures,3co1h6,MasterMirage,7,Thu Jul 9 12:01:16 2015 UTC,Best quote from that blog post:   No figure... ... no life!!!
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,Ten-kara,4,Thu Jul 9 14:17:16 2015 UTC,This figure looks amazing. It's sad that this 1/7 with a detailed base and 4 miniature chibi figures is close in price to some 1/8 figures being released though; getting harder and harder to justify the prices on some releases... (I totally think this figure is worth the price tag though)
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,NobleSic,2,Thu Jul 9 13:36:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm what would shipping be to the US? It is extremely tempting even at that price point...   edit: nm got her from AmiAmi, much easier(?) price to digest."
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,deusxanime,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:28:35 2015 UTC,yeah dude Also I'm from Australia so my shipping prices would be different. I'd predict around 2500-3500Y for shipping on that particular figure though...
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,NobleSic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:09:24 2015 UTC,I'm from Australia and big in Japan gives 1280 yen as the shipping estimate for this figure. It still comes to around 160 AUD in total though
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,JasonCheeseballs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:06:46 2015 UTC,I was saying EMS but I could still be wrong.  I might have to check em out thanks :)
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,NobleSic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. The details of her eyes, her crown, and her hair! It looks super nice. Plus, the miniature figures you get all look super nice too.   I've never bought a scale figure, but how much size difference is there between 1/7 and 1/8?"
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,duki512,3,Thu Jul 9 13:55:54 2015 UTC,Not a huge difference.  It just irks me a little that a bigger and better figure in my opinion can be priced reasonably where some others seem to have puzzlingly steep prices.   I know they can charge what they want but still...
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,NobleSic,2,Thu Jul 9 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"And just as I bought a Kotobukiya Shiro from a user on MFC yesterday. :P  But, nevertheless, this is a preorder, but one that I will probably get in the end. She just looks like she'd be perfect with the other 1/7 Kotobukiya Shiro."
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,LethalassassinX,2,Thu Jul 9 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"I just noticed but, she's gonna be standing on one leg only! Hope it's sturdy enough!"
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,Atheisticles,2,Thu Jul 9 15:56:12 2015 UTC,Is Phat gonna make the rest of the characters in similar fashion?  A Sora figure with chibi Shiro?
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,djlacer,3,Thu Jul 9 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on this vs the koto one  Personally I like the softer pastel hair colors on the koto version more. Also her eyes seem too large for her head, especially if you compare it to the koto figure, it's bit off putting for me. Finally her hair wisps don't look as natural, they seem kind wacky in how they fly of her head.  The base is cool, especially with all the mini figures you get, but I much prefer the koto version overall. (I don't/won't own either however, just my thoughts)"
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,Snacker864,2,Thu Jul 9 20:31:48 2015 UTC,This looks so good. I also am glad sora got a tiny bit of the figure love he deserves today. Since release is January I'll have a few months to save up if I order. I don't see any exclusive versions so lots of shopping choices..
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,Arsonic68,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:54:42 2015 UTC,Must.... Have.... This!!!! Meanwhile wallet is bleeding to death
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,Curius0ne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"I wasn't enamoured of this figure when I first saw the release - besides, I got Koto's, which I love. But seeing it all painted, with the chibis... it's more than a Shiro figure, like Kahotan says, it's the whole NGNL world in one figure! Have to buy!"
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,klipson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:51:03 2015 UTC,This was a no brainer for me. Love Shiro design! And this figure is pretty and the fact that she comes with 4 chibi figures! Sold!
AnimeFigures,3co1h6,MiyuuCupcake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:35 2015 UTC,I hope they make a Jibril one soon.
AnimeFigures,3cob9j,rockboy8,2,Thu Jul 9 13:39:08 2015 UTC,"Nice! Do you have a link for where you bought it? And im assuming you added the LED's yourself? They look like logisys, but not sure. Looks very nice tho! How do they look when the rooms dark?"
AnimeFigures,3cob9j,duki512,2,Thu Jul 9 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"The glass display case is an Ikea detolf and the lights were also bought at ikea, and are an ikea Dioder 4 piece LED stip set. and This is a link to what it looks like when its dark, sorry about the terrible camera."
AnimeFigures,3cplr9,vree360,2,Thu Jul 9 19:31:40 2015 UTC,They switched bases midway in the series run for some reason.  Issues with the old base supporting the figure? Your guess is as good as mine.  Prototype Saki looks like she will have the rounded base too.  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/320011
AnimeFigures,3cplr9,whut-whut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"I think when they first anounced them they would all have those round bases. But when my first figure came in I was like yeah thats a pitty. But now they actually made them look roundish. Wich is nice, but now it's kinda strange when you place them together that they have different bases :p"
AnimeFigures,3cplr9,duki512,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:04:27 2015 UTC,Dang Hinata is so cute. I've never seen figures for this series. Very nice!

AnimeFigures,3co9cg,IGotGoats,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:54 2015 UTC,Is it me or is it really that cheap? It shows that it's 20$ for me.
AnimeFigures,3co9cg,AnthonyDraft,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:12 2015 UTC,I'm at comicon and got to see that exact figure. It looks well made for $20 same with rin.
AnimeFigures,3co9cg,MAD_FR0GZ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there seems to be a class of ~$24 figures. There's some idolmaster ones and Madoka ones from Banpresto, including a Rin (UBW) that is currently being bundled with this Saber from GSC.  They're all relatively plain (plain white dresses), which probably accounts for the cost. I still think they're nice to look at, and could fill up lots of shelf space. I bought all of them TT_TT"
AnimeFigures,3co9cg,Vindicator209,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:18:05 2015 UTC,To add context I have never pre-ordered before as I am relatively new to collecting and I am exciting to have this figure and laughed when I saw the delivery estimate of Jul. 28 to Aug. 14
AnimeFigures,3co9cg,Zilveari,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:21:57 2015 UTC,Well it is being shipped from Tokyo.  I assume that Jul 28 is the earliest possible for EMS.  With the 14th maybe being SAL?
AnimeFigures,3co9cg,Zilveari,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I expected the long wait I just laugh every time I see it.  Just like when I get a tracking # and it is not really use-able until it hits the states.  It will say for weeks nothing more than it left the post office until  DHL or whoever get its."
AnimeFigures,3co9cg,Draigg836,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah my current order from AmiAmi is via EMS.

AnimeFigures,3cm19c,lisauntie,3,Thu Jul 9 02:17:23 2015 UTC,lol in the first pic it looks like Sinon is about to snap Kirito's neck.
AnimeFigures,3cm19c,lisauntie,2,Thu Jul 9 02:56:06 2015 UTC,She might've been thinking about it. But The Flash is literally right there. She's smarter thsn that :D
AnimeFigures,3cm19c,lisauntie,2,Thu Jul 9 03:16:30 2015 UTC,Mine got here a few days ago! She's so cute <3 Did you preorder undine? I ordered her today :D
AnimeFigures,3cm19c,PopVuIture,2,Thu Jul 9 11:33:56 2015 UTC,Yup! First thing I did when I got the newsletter saying pre-order was open :).   I wish they made figmas of the whole gang. A Kirito/Klein reunion would be awesome! Lol
AnimeFigures,3cm19c,kris12k4,2,Thu Jul 9 11:45:06 2015 UTC,Klein would be awesome! I really want yuuki first though xp  I also ordered her today! Didn't go for the exclusive faceplate though. For americans it might mean 10-20$ extra but for me (netherlands) it would mean paying twice as much due to customs :/
AnimeFigures,3cm19c,3nterShift,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"But... But her smile is worth a fortune! I had a similar hard decision with Fate/Stay Tohsaka Rin 2.0. And like that struggle, I opted to get the smiling face plate, too "":)  PS. I would also love a Yuuki Figma!"
AnimeFigures,3cnwdu,Zilveari,2,Thu Jul 9 10:58:56 2015 UTC,I'm seeing her as out of stock with a couple used ones for sale.

AnimeFigures,3cnwdu,BrownSugarSandwich,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:05:33 2015 UTC,Maybe they found one in their stock room somewhere. Or it was just an error of some kind. There's lots of released figures they have in stock. Either from people cancelling preorders or being overstocked. So you will see them around.
AnimeFigures,3cnwdu,BrownSugarSandwich,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:34 2015 UTC,"Was definitely more than one.  I can only assume that they found a few hiding under a shelf somewhere.

AnimeFigures,3cmxsw,gpia7r,3,Thu Jul 9 11:47:14 2015 UTC,"It's a bit to close to the other Shiro fig to justify spending this much.  Granted, I can't imagine too many poses that Shiro could be in to make a new figure unique."
AnimeFigures,3cmxsw,Atheisticles,4,Thu Jul 9 04:05:24 2015 UTC,That's good news for those who didn't get the first one
AnimeFigures,3cmxsw,BrownSugarSandwich,3,Thu Jul 9 07:21:31 2015 UTC,It's different enough to me to order it. I can't wait to take pics of them both together and have a couple of the chibis on the other figure <3
AnimeFigures,3cmxsw,mickeydeerho,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"Price is a tad steep but the figure looks great imo! On the bright side, the figure is slated for a January 2016 release so it gives time to save up."

AnimeFigures,3cmxsw,TranClan67,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:32:17 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure the figure comes with the chibi figures (look at that high 13,000 yen price). The anime is a great series to watch in my opinion and the chibi figures in the images are main characters in the series, but in chibi form. The series just needs another season to continue the story- hopefully it happens."

AnimeFigures,3cmbp6,0mfgroflmao,2,Thu Jul 9 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ive been wanting this figure for god knows how long, i got a nice bonus at work the other week and decided to treat myself. The one Rin figure i ever cared for were this one and this one. Only thing is the fence one turned out to be a disappointment. And i know my monitor is tiny but unfortunately nothing bigger will fit between the shelves. D: I could remove them but that would mean relocating my figures to a location farther away from me."

The quality was just mediocre at best and the design is done poorly. He has to sit her against the back of his case or else she falls off the fence. Amazon actually i had been trying to find it for a while but had no luck, then suddenly they started popping up all over Amazon running between $75-$180."
AnimeFigures,3cmbp6,Zilveari,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah the falling is a huge issue. Sometimes the hand doesn't fit on the fence very well either and it just falls over and over.

AnimeFigures,3cmbp6,Zilveari,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:45:33 2015 UTC,"If i could get a hold of the full set i could probably look past the poor design as long as i never moved the figures or looked at the shelf too hard but unless i can nab all of it at a decent price then no.

AnimeFigures,3cmiix,ScottTheHuman,7,Thu Jul 9 01:43:57 2015 UTC,She'll come with the tan base. The clear ones you often see for promotional shots (like the first picture you linked) are only used for the prototypes. You can always check the user pictures for a figure if you want to see what the normal base looks like.
AnimeFigures,3cmiix,TychoRC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"The second figure you linked has a base with the words ""Angel Beats"" written in red on it.  Promo shots of the prototypes almost always have a completely clear base, which they change out when making the actual figure.  Like Tycho said, check actual owner photos, since lots of times even the paint quality, colors, and facial expressions are different than the prototypes."
AnimeFigures,3cmiix,whut-whut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Whoa there's a noticeable difference between the promo fig and the actual product, especially in the wings and hair, that's disappointing."

AnimeFigures,3cmjpz,AlixNguyen,4,Thu Jul 9 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"They come like that when you order them directly from GoodSmile.  Some shops/ebayers keep that foam sheet on when they receive a GoodSmile shipment just to show it's fresh off their assembly lines, while others take the sheet off so they can actually show off the item to sell.  You can order from GoodSmile directly from their website to guarantee nobody touches the foam sheet, but they only sell for their MSRP, to not undercut their resellers who get wholesale pricing and can give you a better deal/discount.  (Though GoodSmile Direct often has unique preorder bonuses that resellers don't have, so paying full price for a nendo from them is sometimes worth it.)"
AnimeFigures,3cmjpz,whut-whut,2,Thu Jul 9 02:14:58 2015 UTC,So now I got it. Cause sometimes the shop I ordered with has cheaper price compared to GSC so I didn't think they would order from GSC and resell it to me. But yeah I forgot about the discounts to wholesaler things. Thank you :)
AnimeFigures,3cmjpz,arcangelxvi,2,Thu Jul 9 03:41:05 2015 UTC,It's basically extra protection for the box (from scuffs) but really wouldn't help at all past that. The real protection for the Nendoroid / any figure is the box used to contain it for shipping and how securely it's held within a safe area inside that box.

AnimeFigures,3ck768,TychoRC,3,Wed Jul 8 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"/u/Zekkyn is correct. They get their name because they are used as prizes for games in Japan.

If I were to preorder from the GSC Online Shop, about how long do these preorder times last? I've already made other purchases that prioritize over this, but I still want her. If the preordering zone is quite large (months if she's not limited) then I'll be fine."
AnimeFigures,3cjghw,LethalassassinX,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:54 2015 UTC,Pre-order time is usually stated in the website for each figure. 1 issue I have with Good Smile is that they sometimes delay a release date for a figure.

I feel like part of the problem is the quantity of the Amiibos in each section (18) makes it feel so cluttered as well as there is no real order to them that I can see (maybe they're by favorites? Or order of release?). I think maybe if they were sorted by size and/or series as well as it would help more, as well as spacing them out a little (maybe 5 per row instead of 6) as it would help the overlap with ones like Charizard."

AnimeFigures,3cjmrd,Ranefea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It is very nice looking, but something similar can be homemade fairly easily and for much less‚Äîwhy should you spend as much as you do on the figure itself for a display case? I do like the adjustable lights, but it would be better if they came in something other than harsh bright white. It works great for more sci-fi oriented figures like that Storm Trooper, but I don't feel like it would be as appropriate for fantasy or slice-of-life characters, where a softer, lightly colored lighting would be much more friendly to them."

AnimeFigures,3chi5r,Exteminator101,3,Tue Jul 7 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"A warm hair dryer can make PVC soft enough to bend into a new shape, but I've only done it on small things like saber's cowlick.  Not sure if straightening an entire sword would go well.  If you do heat it, remember warm, not hot... only use enough heat that it becomes -slightly more bendable to make a minor adjustment. You can always rewarm and repeat tiny adjustments, but you can't recast your figure if you turn it into melted slag.   If the sword is removeable, I'd say heat it on a flat surface and maybe push it against a ruler when it's soft to straighten, so you won't be making more waves and ripples from hand bending."
AnimeFigures,3chi5r,whut-whut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:06:06 2015 UTC,It's already soft enough to bend. So should I go through with the heating?
AnimeFigures,3chi5r,whut-whut,2,Wed Jul 8 06:22:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, heat will make it so the bends 'stay' after cooling down... just be careful how much you heat it.  (PVC in figures is mixed with softener chemicals to lower its melting point... If it's already really soft, it won't take much to make it a temperature that's easy to change shape and set.)"
AnimeFigures,3chi5r,Ranefea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:30:27 2015 UTC,"If you go with the heating method, I suggest using something like popsicle sticks on either side of the blade (top and bottom) to help keep it as straight as possible, and leave them there until the plastic is fully cooled and firmed again. A table and ruler will work, too, as whut-whut said, but you'll have more control and they'll be easier to hold against something so small."

If you go bigger, the steps get taller, and your front row heads won't cover up your back row feet as much, so get as tall a step you can.  I ended up getting mine from here  http://www.achievedisplay.com/acrylic-stairstep-risers.asp  I bought two other acrylics with it, since they had the dimensions I needed, so I'm not sure how the price for just one riser plus shipping would compare to amazon, but they came out cheaper for me in my bulk purchase, so I went with them.  Most of these acrylic display sellers cut and bend their own acrylic sheets to make these displays, so if you don't see the exact size and step dimension you want, you can ask them for quotes.

AnimeFigures,3cihwv,whut-whut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:53:21 2015 UTC,"I think in another thread someone bought a stair step dishholder from ikea as a super-cheap riser... ~$7 ish, but the steps were only one or two inches tall, so the back rows are barely higher than the front.  But no, you sound like you already know what you're getting.  I can only recommend to you their meatballs. :)"
AnimeFigures,3cihwv,SpookSquad,2,Wed Jul 8 06:06:58 2015 UTC,meatballs for sure. otherwise why would i go to ikea?
AnimeFigures,3cihwv,talkstomuffintrees,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:23:03 2015 UTC,This looks similar
AnimeFigures,3cihwv,fry133,2,Wed Jul 8 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"I've heard this one mentioned a lot so I decided to get one. The legs are about an inch too short so everything slides backwards. Very unsafe for my nendos, but I'm hoping I just got unlucky and got a bad one. Luckily amazon has great customer service and refunded me, so for the price these might be worth a try. I'm not sure how common the short leg problem is so it might not end up an issue for most people. If the legs were even it'd be a great riser."
AnimeFigures,3chfp8,SpicyHafu,3,Tue Jul 7 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"Udon will debut a Cammy figure based off of their art for the swimsuit inside cover picture that was part of an exclusive 2 years ago. (can't get a picture, at work) The figure is made by Spice Seed and has been teased a little.  Capcom will have 2 versions of a Ryu figure, one regular and one evil.  Kotobukiya will have a Red She-hulk Bishoujo SDCC exclusive, also Deadpool (ArtFX+) and Alfred (Batman) exclusives  Also check out the distributor's booths, there are some prototypes in them (they had the Union Creative Motoko Kusanagi last year)"
AnimeFigures,3chfp8,scapeogat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:34:42 2015 UTC,Really want to see the Ryu figures.

AnimeFigures,3cgi60,slowpokestampede,4,Tue Jul 7 18:57:13 2015 UTC,wtf I was just about to buy it and sold out lol
AnimeFigures,3cgi60,Tomimi,3,Tue Jul 7 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"Mandarake has you covered, if you still want her ;)"
AnimeFigures,3cgi60,TychoRC,3,Tue Jul 7 20:11:04 2015 UTC,thanks
AnimeFigures,3cgi60,Tomimi,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:24 2015 UTC,One of my favourites! Managed to pick her up for 8000 on my last trip to Japan :)
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Curelli,3,Tue Jul 7 04:03:45 2015 UTC,MFC LINK  Up on AmiAmi
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Dylthenoise,3,Tue Jul 7 04:25:19 2015 UTC,Locked her down on amiami. There won't be another opportunity to get her at a GREAT price once she's gone.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,kingofquackz,6,Tue Jul 7 09:50:36 2015 UTC,"I love the pose and the sculpt, but something about the face seems slightly off. Also kind of afraid of Koto's QC issue, especially with their paint for the hair. Not sure if I should hold out on this and see if Alter or GSC will pick it up, since I already missed out on Koto's Yui meaning I'd have to look for her in the aftermarket as well, if I do end up getting Koto's Yukinon."
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Lonaticus,2,Tue Jul 7 05:54:43 2015 UTC,"but something about the face seems slightly off   Do you mean the left eye being a bit offset (too far away from the nose), or the expression? Melancholic Yukino fits better with the theme and story of Season 2."
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,kingofquackz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:21:01 2015 UTC,Expression is great. It might be the eyes or the nose.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Lonaticus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:34:19 2015 UTC,If you look at their recent Saber/Hestia/Yui trio you will notice a lot of similarities in their facial features. Guess this is a new trend for them?
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,K_ON,4,Tue Jul 7 07:21:15 2015 UTC,"The only thing that refrains me from buying it, is the fact that it's made by Kotobukiya. The final product will indoubtedly be inferior to the prototype, and considering I'd have to pay loads of taxes, 100 euros for a Koto figure is a little too much.  I hope that GSC or another more qualitative toy maker will also make a figure of Yukinon & Yui, because I like both characters, but changes of that happening are slim I guess."
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Rath1on,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:25:36 2015 UTC,Why are you getting downvoted?
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,K_ON,3,Tue Jul 7 12:12:57 2015 UTC,"I guess because not everyone agrees with my viewpoint regarding Kotobukiya. Quite sad, as the lack of QC at Kotobukiya is not something I've invented. I've stated my displeasure about Kotobukiya for the second time on this sub already, but atleast I motivate my answers.  Ah, it's the internet for some reason. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Rath1on,2,Tue Jul 7 12:47:30 2015 UTC,"I thought it was well known that koto's quality/quality control was always not the best, but that's that okay because their stuff is usually priced pretty good. But if your customs tax makes it significantly more expensive, it's a reasonable thing to say that it becomes no longer worth the price. I don't see a reason to get upset over such an opinion. Oh well. As you say, the internet is the internet."
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,gnauhZ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:02:09 2015 UTC,Yeah. I own a few kotobukiya figures and the qc seems lacking. I also can't quite put my finger on it but their hair always seems off to me.  Like it's not realistic or it feels too solid like.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,traxions,3,Tue Jul 7 16:46:55 2015 UTC,Love it. Looks more true to the character than the Yui one.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,meb9000,2,Tue Jul 7 04:51:11 2015 UTC,"The quality on this Yukino figure is nice, but I wish they hadn't chosen such a slouching and melancholy pose for her. She may be the kuudere type, but she usually has a more stoic and regal posture than that. The Yui figure that goes with her just evokes much more cheerfulness and feels ""right"". Even though they go together nicely, I just don't know if I'm gonna preorder this one alongside the Yui."
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,paladinmahdi,2,Tue Jul 7 05:55:39 2015 UTC,"I preorderd it from Amiami, this is my first time preordering, do they only take money after it became available ? so that means in December ?"
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Zaidbenh,4,Tue Jul 7 06:46:42 2015 UTC,That is correct. They ask for payment when it comes in stock.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Lonaticus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:58:27 2015 UTC,She looks a bit melancholic... aaah who am I kidding? Already pre-ordered! Now we just need a chibi 8man to complete the trio.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Joseph1917,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:33:43 2015 UTC,She looks amazing.; -; Now I hope koto or hopefully GSC comes out with Hikki to complete the Trio.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Drwildy,4,Tue Jul 7 04:40:51 2015 UTC,or Iroha.. AND hikki
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,SirFitzey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:00:55 2015 UTC,YES WE NEED HIKKI!
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Joseph1917,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:43:31 2015 UTC,Hoping with that new company GSC announced dedicated to male figures we will see Hikki.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Saitoyama,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:46:56 2015 UTC,I'm happy how it turned it out. It makes me want to get Yui too eventually.
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Blackspearr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:35:06 2015 UTC,Hey guys. Since I'm new tho whole figures thing I have one question. Yui's figure reservations are already closed on both amiami and hobby search. Do you guys know if they usually allow more reservations if something is so popular?
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,lionhearth21,2,Tue Jul 7 08:58:19 2015 UTC,you can still get her on HLJ http://hlj.com/product/KBYPP-611/Fig
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Cyric1972,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:52:56 2015 UTC,thanks I was just looking for Yui after seeing this!
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,TheChau,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they usually open up more orders as I'm quite new myself, however, the Yui figure is still on sale on Toyko Otaku Mode although the price is much higher than AmiAmi or Hobby Search even without shipping."
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,Blackspearr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I found it on few sites but as you said, price is much, much higher :("

AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,VanillaTortilla,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:09:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like Yui a bit more than Yukinon, and I'm really glad I pre-ordered her instead of waiting. Yukinon just looks.. off, for some reason, maybe her pose?"
AnimeFigures,3cdy1f,sagrado_corazon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:39:46 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever pre-ordered figures this quickly. Both Yukino and Yuki look amazing...and just had to get them.
