Massdrop,3e1dbm,monman42,4,Tue Jul 21 05:13:36 2015 UTC,"the main flaw is that it cannot easily be done for gpu waterblocks simply due to sheer # of blocks available(unless its universal). Though if people could get discounts on say certain fittings, that would go somewhere. It could technically work, but not sure the custom watercooling community is large enough to have this work out really well, especially since in custom watercooling, everyone has various preferences on choices(which block and brand they use, which tubing size and color, which kinds of fittings etc) which do not overlap very well."

Basically, there is a voting phase in which interest is drummed up for a product, and then Massdrop negotiates a price with the company? After that, the option to buy becomes available, and everyone gets the item for the final price, which is determined by how many people decide to buy?  Thanks in advance"
Massdrop,3dmjqz,merkaba8,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"If the poll is successfull they negotiate with the company and the drop is created, after that people can join the drop. Lower prices are unlocked when more people join."
Massdrop,3dmjqz,merkaba8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, but this is the type of language that is used on the website also and the source of the confusion.  What does ""join the drop"" mean? Commit to paying the currently listed price? Commit to paying the currently listed price or the better price if the better price is achieved? No commitment at all?  Their website uses this terminology even in the basic explanation and FAQ that seem to presuppose people are familiar with even when it is designed as an explanation."

Massdrop,3d0jg2,FlyingSkyWizard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"The Vinco wallet is hand made by us, it takes us a few hours to make each one. The good thing about the Vinco wallet is that it's less than a millimetre thick and will protect every card (7 cards plus cash) in it and should you decide not to replace your wallet it fits seamlessly into one of the cards spots.  Compared to other RFID blocking wallets which are mainly made from paper and only have one lining of foil, the Vinco uses a dual layer of custom made RFID film so it offers more protection.  Also it made of tyvek which is awesome because its super strong, tear resistant and water resistant so your cards are not only protected from scammers but nature too.  Mass Drop doesn't allow you to add any content, just pictures.  Hope that helps"
Massdrop,3d0jg2,Goobyalus,3,Sun Jul 12 16:21:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I was referring to http://www.vincolife.com/, not Massdrop. Massdrop links to your site. I noticed ""It takes up to 7 cards and a few folded bills."" a little while later, way at the bottom of a product page.   If I may be so bold as to offer some constructive criticism for your website:   add photos with more than a single card inside make the Vinco Life logo much smaller, at least on product pages - it takes too much space when someone is trying to look at the product make the product image smaller, especially since there is zoom anyway. The description should be visible and prominent right away. move the description/reviews/size chart panel under the product title - it should be obvious where to find details like how many cards it holds. clean up whatever is currently under the product title (and move it) - the description is redundant, obviously the vendor is Vinco Life, availability would be more appropriate integrated with the ""add to cart"" button, etc.    Once I see the price and add to cart button, I subconsciously assume everything afterward is of little importance and scroll no further, which is why I didnt know how many cards it is supposed to hold."

It's all in the review I've posted earlier :)  Judging by the reviews I'd say that Sennheiser in the same price range would be lousier (you pay for the brand), not to mention that these are double driver IEMs (two speakers per ear) - which helps clear out the sound a bit.  And they're definitely gonna be light years ahead compared to apple earbuds.  Although watch it - once you get the headphone hunger, it's VERY hard to stop ;)"

I purchased the following items, and they ended up costing me the following:   Audioengine D1 DAC and Integrated Amplifier - under $160CAD HiSound Audio WooDuo 2 IEM with Free Shipping - $72CAD EZGO Slim Wallet - $21CAD EZGO Wallet - $22CAD AKG Q701 Audiophile Headphones - $195ishCAD (includes customs fees) Klhip Nail Clipper - $64.99CAD The Ridge Wallet - $67.47CAD GIR Spatula: UItimate - $31.10CAD   The last three items are the exact amount I paid.  Everything above is an approximation of what I paid based on my memory and the exchange rate around that time.  In each case, I came out ahead since the item I purchased cost more through a Canadian retailer or the company's actual site (Gir, Klhip, Ridge, EZGO).  Not everything on Massdrop is a good deal, but I'd say about 50% of the time you'll see some savings."
Massdrop,3c8pd0,Jhantax,2,Mon Jul 6 14:20:57 2015 UTC,Have you joined the vote for introducing Massdrop into other countries? Canada is right at the top  https://www.massdrop.com/vote/have-a-massdrop-in-my-country-avoid-custom-clearance-avoids-the-exchange-rate
Massdrop,3c8pd0,fudge_u,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yes I did, I saw it shortly after I posted this, I hope Massdrop introduce Canadian version with lower shipping fees and, hopefully fair currency exchange."
Massdrop,3c8pd0,Jhantax,2,Tue Jul 7 21:31:49 2015 UTC,To ship just within Canada it's usually 10 or 15 dollars.
Massdrop,3c8pd0,LedBiscuit,0,Mon Jul 6 11:53:17 2015 UTC,"It actually varies.  If the item is smaller, then it'll be as little as $2 to ship.  If the item ships direct from the manufacturer, shipping might even be free.  Checking all of my orders, each item cost $2-6 to ship.  Only the Audioengine D1 DAC and AKG Q701 headphones cost most than $10.  They cost $20 and $12.99 to ship, and I was only dinged customs fees on the Q701.  The WooDuo IEMs came with free shipping since they shipped directly from the manufacturer."

Massdrop,3c8pd0,NewzyOne,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"If youre close to the border, get setup at a mailbox/forwarder place. I have used one in Blaine, WA for about a decade now, never had an issue and has saved me untold amounts of money over the years on my hobbies, getting gifts, etc. I order stuff delivered there and then go down and pick it up. Bringing it back into Canada you just declare it at the border. Often Canada Customs doesnt charge me, my record so far that I can remember is $800 in stuff coming back into Canada after a 30 minute trip and they waved me through. I might have gotten more once.  There has only been one company over the years that had an issue shipping there out of hundreds of transactions, nissanpartsdeal.com wanted me to use their preferred service. I told them which bridge to jump off and bought elsewhere.  I order from Amazon all the time to my mailbox and its awesome.  Protip, combine this with getting your Nexus card. Its $50 for five years and saves you time at the border, EVERY. SINGLE. CROSSING. Only way to make dealing with US Customs slightly more tolerable.  TLDR: Get a mailbox in a US border town, pick the stuff up yourself, save money. Get a Nexus card for even more win."
Massdrop,3c8pd0,NewzyOne,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"Bought some custom one pro's not long ago from massdrop. Was my first time buying so I didn't know what to expect. UK customs decided to charge me almost £15 ($23) handling fees on top of I believe it was 20% of the price of the headphones, the cost of the headphones ended up still being cheaper than they were in the uk but only by £10. Which has kept me (unfortunately) from ordering from massdrop again, I realise it's not their fault, but this on top of shipping just forces me to keep away."

Massdrop,39jvkh,andreashcfc,5,Fri Jun 12 06:12:30 2015 UTC,"It all starts with Polls. You can make a poll for just about anything really, just whatever you're interested in buying and is legal. You (or someone else) starts a poll, gives some options for shit, and then submit it.   After the poll is submitted, the users then vote on whichever options they want the most, they can also add in another choice if the one they wanted isn't already an option. Once that poll reaches 200 votes, MassDrop gets a notification to check it out (I believe).   Once a poll is at its goal the waiting game begins. MD has to find a vendor that is willing to participate and handle the sale, this can be difficult from time to time. Could take a few days, could take weeks/months. Shit, some polls have been waiting almost a year to find a vendor that will work with them. Also, just because one of the options has 500 points and the rest have 20, that doesn't guarantee that THAT will be the item sold. It could be something different but still something from the poll, this isn't uncommon.   Once they find a vendor though, they work out a deal for price points, units available for sale, shipping restrictions and cost, all the back end stuff. When all of THAT is figured out, they start the drop. I think the average time that a drop is live is about 10 days, sometimes more/less, or until they sold out if they're limited to say a drop of 250 unites.  After that, we sit back and wait for it to ship and get to us.   That was more of a rough explanation of the site itself instead of just drops, but knowing a bit of it all will help in the long run."

Massdrop,39hg7d,BetaCris,2,Thu Jun 11 19:08:13 2015 UTC,What would be the price point however? And how many would need to be committed?
Massdrop,39hg7d,CSHustle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well most of the bags are 150 - 250 range. Generally, once 200 people have polled. The item with the most votes wins and then Massdrop contacts the manufacture asking for a group buy rate. The discount really depends on the company. Some offer large cuts, some do not. Once agreed, then massdrop will add the posting to the ""buy"" section where a minimum would need to commit to get the full discount and such.   For example: Lets say the Ranger bag @ 174.00 retail wins the poll. Massdrop contacts and asks if they can offer volume price drops. So maybe they say if massdrop can commit 50 purchases it will lower the cost to $160.00 and if 100 commit they lower it to $145.00."

So if this helps I think for the price of the c line grips is very good and even for what it is the b line is great too. Not putting down the a line versions as those seem to be the most popular but for what I want these two are great.

If they are, they will send stuff in and drop, if they aren't then nothing happens. you don't have to vote for multiple stuff, its best to vote for stuff that you may be interested in buying as it gives massdrop a better guage on what the community wants."

Massdrop,38x7be,pisangwong95,2,Sun Jun 7 16:40:11 2015 UTC,Yes it would. Further clarification. You see the 3 black bands on the gold plated connector on the ebay listing? That is called a 4 poll connector (4 being the gold spaces between the black bands). Which allows for both audio out and in. Where as if you looked at your average headphones they would only have 2 black bands and thus 3 sections of gold.

I'm always very sketchy about ordering switches that have no real track record behind them.  In fact only recently did i order my first kailh to compare and contrast it to my Cherry based boards and do a review/compare on my channel and even then not sure if i'd be trusting in kailh enough to keep it long term.

If you find any videos of someone who has owned it for at least a year for that i would be VERY interested to see as i have not found any myself (Assuming it's even been out a year yet.)"

It is the fact that the transaction was removed from my Massdrop account and the only proof I have of the transaction is the charge on my credit card statement. It just worries me."
Massdrop,32hbc1,llamadrea,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:29:44 2015 UTC,Hey! I have a similar issue with Massdrop at the moment. Tech support says they can't do anything about it since there is no transaction history on my account. I was wondering if your issue ever got solved?

The K553 launched exclusively on Massdrop earlier this week and after seeing the strong initial response from our members, we went back to negotiate for the community. After many discussions over several days we achieved success and now the K553 is available for an exclusive launch price of $119.99 shipped in the USA once the drop reaches 1000 participants. To give our members a chance to fully take advantage of this exciting development, we're extending the current drop end date to April 5th, 2015."""

Try to avoid boxing something unless you want to make it distinct from something else.  A good example would be that (in screen 3) you don't need to box anything because it's one product.  Except the Join Now button, that should be a distinct button. Your dropshadows are pretty heavy, I'd suggest toning them down.   Here is an example I threw together of an equivalent of your third screen."

Massdrop,2yrtnm,theduncan,2,Thu Mar 12 08:32:16 2015 UTC,Near Field Communication.  You can do many things with them.  There are locks that you can use them with them.  You can use them to unlock phones (if they have nfc capabilities) or exchange info like a business card.
Massdrop,2yrtnm,autowikibot,2,Thu Mar 12 08:38:57 2015 UTC,"Near field communication:       Near field communication (NFC) is a set of ideas and technology that enables smartphones and other devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, typically a distance of 10 cm (3.9 in) or less. Each full NFC device can work in 3 modes: NFC target (acting like a credential), NFC initiator (as a reader) and NFC peer to peer. Most of the first business models like advertisement tags or other industrial applications have not been successful, always overtaken by another technology (3D barcodes, UHF tags, ...) The main advantage of NFC is that NFC devices are often cloud connected, ""Connected"" credentials can be provisioned over the air unlike a standard card (Hotel or visitor applications). All connected NFC enabled smartphones can be provisioned with dedicated apps, which gives any application a huge potential, like dedicated readers (as opposed to the traditional dedicated infrastructure of ticket), access control or payment readers. All NFC peers can connect a third party NFC device with a server for any action or reconfiguration.

Massdrop,2tpecg,gx1400,12,Mon Jan 26 13:06:53 2015 UTC,"These kinds of polls always annoy me a little. I get worried that some people are getting their hopes up over something that won't happen. No way the manufacturer would give any sort of decent drop on cards that are relatively new, sell well, and make them huge profits.  That's why most of the massdrop products tend to be niche items, like mechanical keyboards, audiophile headphones, obscure clothing brands, tea, etc etc.  Power to them to try though, I suppose."
Massdrop,2tpecg,Xeno4494,2,Mon Jan 26 15:32:14 2015 UTC,most of the tea deals were horrible by the way. i'm not sure that any of them even made it to the lowest bracket. I'm not really sure why massdrop doesn't google the products they drop to make sure their users are going to buy it.

Massdrop,2svl2j,Realforce_87UKB,5,Sun Jan 18 23:32:30 2015 UTC,There are gaming microphones that cost $125???? FOR GAMING? That don't have headphones attached to them??
Massdrop,2svl2j,inphu510n,4,Mon Jan 19 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, total waste of money. Just like any pair of headphones that is billed as a ""gaming headset"". Gaming headsets are shitty headphones with shitty mics attached.  What you really want is a reasonably-priced mic like a Blue Snowball or Samson Meteorite, or even an attachable one like a ModMic, paired with a good pair of audiophile headphones."
Massdrop,2svl2j,shadowdude777,2,Mon Jan 19 14:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yup. I have a blue snowball right now, but it picks up too much noise (mechanical keyboard) while I'm gaming with teammates. So I think the ModMic is a good alternative for me."

Massdrop,2svl2j,Nyen191,5,Mon Jan 19 15:13:01 2015 UTC,The branding and the price.
Massdrop,2svl2j,Sekraan,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"Gaming mics are preferably bidirectional.  Normal mics are often omnidirectional, taking in sound from all sides, which picks up unwanted ambient noise like your keyboard and mouse usage.  Once you get above the price point where gaming mics tend to be you start running into condensor microphones.  These are even worse at picking up ambient noise and aren't well suited to gaming use."
Massdrop,2svl2j,leifmt,2,Mon Feb 9 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"I can reccommend the antlion modmic. I've owned one for a few months and the clarity and quality is amazing. Easily good enough to record yourself with, although I only really need it for teamspeak/skype."

Without direct light at just the right angle they look black, but every once in a while I get a shimmer and they shine super blue.

Massdrop,2quuc5,Ruthalas,5,Tue Dec 30 22:06:25 2014 UTC,"1 - Honestly, there's no real time. There are polls from last year that are STILL waiting to become drops, then there are others that become a drop within a week or 2. It depends on the vendor more than anything.  2 - You'll need to just browse and see it on your own. They don't send you updates for when your poll or a poll you voted on becomes a drop.  3 - Massdrop employees, no clue who specifically though. New categories come when there's a large enough request for one though.  4 - As far as I've seen, it's only ever been for paraphernalia. At least until a Fleshlight drop happens or something like that.  5 - No clue on that one."
Massdrop,2quuc5,Dynamiklol,2,Tue Dec 30 22:24:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the quick answer Dynamiklol! A few follow up questions:   Ok, so they turn into a drop only once the deal has been brokered? Gotcha. How does one request stuff? Gotcha."
Massdrop,2quuc5,Dynamiklol,2,Wed Dec 31 06:53:39 2014 UTC,"1 - Basically, yes. Massdrop will see the thread for whatever product and reach out to a vendor and figure out a deal. If the vendor agrees, then we'll get a drop and the vendor will give all of the details regarding price, quantity, yadda yadda.  3 - Good question. I think it's more on the quantity of polls for a certain category. Like, there's now a Tea category. The reason it's there is because there were a lot of polls pertaining to Tea that were successful, and continue to be successful, so that was reason enough to add a specific category."
Massdrop,2quuc5,xenopain,2,Wed Dec 31 20:10:04 2014 UTC,"So, final question:  What is the purpose of the 200 vote metric?  Is it basically a rule-of-thumb, 'people are kind of interested in this' thing?  If it doesn't indicate that Massdrop will necessarily try and broker the deal, then it isn't an exceptionally useful number to pay attention to, yes?  (This sounds perturbed, but I'm mainly just curious.)"

Massdrop,2qri6k,JokersSmile,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:32:04 2014 UTC,"I had this big long post explaining how the shipping works at Massdrop. But I forgot to hit submit and now I've left work.  Judging by the drop you mentioned. It appears you've ordered one of the Bazaar items. These are items that have been sucessfully dropped before and Massdrop has extra on hand. That means that shipping should be fairly quick. As the batches are smaller and they don't have to wait on their supplier.  Normally, you would have to wait for the drop to end. Then the process starts. It can take anywhere from 2+ months for an item to ship out after the drop ends. Or it can be 2 days. It all depends on how the shipping is arranged. Usually the drop will have information in the description about expected shipping times.   This is the drop I'm assuming you ""joined"": https://www.massdrop.com/buy/bonavita-gooseneck-electric-kettle?s=Bonavita  Also, support@massdrop.com is the official support email.

Massdrop,2ow8xi,MrMartinotti,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:47:25 2014 UTC,Basically this. Sometimes sellers also require MassDrop to become a certified supplier which takes time. It also can take awhile for the MD agent to find the right guy to talk to.  If it's not an item that's been on MassDrop before or it's a company that has never been on MassDrop it will most likely take a few months(atleast 2 or 3).

Honestly, they're not going to lie on the customs form for you. You're going to get hit with it no matter what, unless you have someone willing to reship it for you."

Massdrop,2ns667,PayphonesareObsolete,1 point,Mon Dec 1 03:00:13 2014 UTC,I'm not sure actually. But it was for two Orbitkeys so my guess is somewhere around $50ish
Massdrop,2ns667,FortunateB0B,2,Mon Dec 1 08:00:35 2014 UTC,"being in CA with tax and shipping, the deal doesn't look so good if that's the lowest drop"
Massdrop,2ns667,lethargicmeep,2,Mon Dec 1 13:19:26 2014 UTC,"For two leather with stitching Orbitkeys, it cost ~$59 USD shipped for me. It's extra for the leather. A decent deal since one leather is $33 USD + $7 USD shipping on the Orbitkey website."

Massdrop,2ni3n8,fraserfra,2,Wed Nov 26 18:57:57 2014 UTC,Q: Why don't you guys ship internationally?  A: Because we're not allowed to due to distribution agreements.  From the first page of the discussion on: https://www.massdrop.com/buy/magic-2015-pre-order?s=magic
Massdrop,2ni3n8,JokersSmile,1 point,Wed Nov 26 19:54:02 2014 UTC,"oh, thanks. would it ever be possible to ship to the UK?"

You might just have to wait out the weekend. They are a small team, but they are quite responsive. Rest assured that they'll send you a replacement."
Massdrop,2n8ldl,lethargicmeep,1 point,Mon Nov 24 06:24:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I got an answer in under 24 hours on a weekend last time. Maybe just bad timing, but I'd check your spam box or use another email address."

Massdrop,2myftd,DynamiteRiven,4,Fri Nov 21 05:04:59 2014 UTC,You can cancel any order that hasn't been completed/shipped yet. I.e: any order that is still available to join.  You can do it in the transactions page.
Massdrop,2myftd,King_of_All_the_Land,1 point,Fri Nov 21 05:52:35 2014 UTC,My experience is that you can try.  I'm trying to cancel an order that has not even shipped yet (Massdrop is late as usual).  My email correspondence with their help told me they were not allowed to cancel the order.
Massdrop,2myftd,ButImUsingMyWholeAss,1 point,Fri Nov 21 16:59:22 2014 UTC,Thanks for this. I was able to cancel before the window closed on accepting orders. Appears it was cheaper and faster for me to go with http://falbatech.pl/
Massdrop,2myftd,ThreeFourChaChaCha,1 point,Sun Nov 30 18:56:16 2014 UTC,I saw quite a few people trying to cancel after the fiasco that's going on with the zeroUV Wayfarer Sunglasses. Emailing support is the only way to do it once it's been paid.

There are a few things that Massdrop sucks at, and that's one of them."
Massdrop,2mrkxe,Dynamiklol,1 point,Thu Nov 20 09:34:41 2014 UTC,Agreed. Maybe it's their current staffing but since November they added significantly more products than in the past. Mostly teas but nonetheless more items.

REI has Patagonia down jacket (800 fill goose down) on sale right now, $169.99 (regularly 229.99). Also, Patagonia runs clearance sales on their site once or twice a year, where you can find pretty good deals fyi.

Massdrop,2m9f7t,csl512,2,Fri Nov 14 21:30:29 2014 UTC,This is really annoying to get the cards in and out. I bought one and it hasn't been in use. Waiting on my slim.
Massdrop,2m9f7t,milkypostman,1 point,Fri Nov 14 11:29:15 2014 UTC,"I have to agree. You have to remove 2 cards to get to the third. Cash in the middle can also be a pain (with CAD money anyway). It's just wide enough to allow the height of the bill in, but it takes a lot of effort.  I still use it every day because it's nicer than my old wallet, but I'm in the market for something better."

Massdrop,2m9djj,kclo4,1 point,Sun Nov 16 23:27:40 2014 UTC,"YES.  these will run laps around the A2s, because of their clever aluminum design they have quite a large internal volume compared to other speakers made from wood or fibers in the same class of speaker.  also, the dip switches on the back make them superior to other desk speakers because you can adjust the frequency response to account for being near a wall or having the speakers on the desk.  genelec is a leader in reference monitor technology.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP71yCwYxe4"

Massdrop,2lkodi,1sty,1 point,Fri Nov 7 12:30:39 2014 UTC,"The quality is fairly normal for lightsabers. I own a pair and just looking up Ultrasaber's customer service record can be harrowing. I love mine, but it has its problems, such as hard edges angles not being rounded off properly and being scratchy and able to cut your hand.   As for durability and versatility, well their blades are sweet.   Personally, though, I would advise people to go the custom saber route. You'll spend about the same amount of money, but you'll actually be a Jedi then. Or a Sith, whatever your preference would be."
